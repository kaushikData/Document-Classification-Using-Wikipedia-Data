'''''Ace Comics''''' was a comic book series published by [[David McKay Publications]] between 1937 and 1949 — starting just before the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. The title reprinted syndicated newspaper strips owned by [[King Features Syndicate]], following the successful formula of a mix of adventure and humor strips introduced by McKay in their ''[[King Comics]]'' title in April 1936; some of the strips transferred from ''King Comics'' from issue #1. ''Ace Comics'' #11, the first appearance of [[The Phantom]], is regarded by many to be a key issue in the history of comics, as it introduced to the comics format one of the first of the costumed heroes, leading to the Golden Age of superheroes in comics.

== Publication history ==
The first issue of ''Ace Comics'' was published in April 1937, and included the adventures of hunter ''[[Jungle Jim]]'' written by [[Flash Gordon]] writer [[Alex Raymond]], Chic Young's ''[[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]]'', and [[George Herriman]]'s surreal ''[[Krazy Kat]]'' strip, all three characters going on to appear in every issue of ''Ace Comics''. Issue #11 (cover date February 1938) is notable as a key Golden Age comic, as it introduced to a wider audience one of the first costumed heroes ever to be featured in a comic book, [[Lee Falk]]'s ''[[The Phantom]]'' — pre-dating ''[[Superman]]'' (''[[Action Comics]]'' #1, cover date June 1938). ''The Phantom'' [[daily strip]], written by [[Ray Moore (comics)|Ray Moore]] and drawn by [[Wilson McCoy]], then featured in ''Ace Comics'' for a 140-issue run, appearing in every issue until the title was cancelled. Initially ''The Phantom'' was a four-page story, but from #38 this was increased to eight pages in each issue. Towards the end of the run, the [[Sunday strip]]s were also included. Many of the strips were edited and cropped from the original newspaper stories, and the text was often rewritten also.

As well as ''Jungle Jim'' and ''The Phantom'', which ran throughout the series, [[Hal Foster]]'s knight's tale of ''[[Prince Valiant]]'' was also a long-running adventure feature, published in issues 26-134. Other adventure strips that appeared included [[Zane Grey]]'s Western character Tex Thorne in early issues, the adventures of orphan Tim Tyler in ''[[Tim Tyler's Luck]]'' and ''{{ill|Curley Harper at Lakespur|fr}}'' both by ''Blondie'' writer/artist Chic Young's brother [[Lyman Young]]. ''Tim Tyler's Luck'' ran in every issue of ''Ace Comics'', while the Curley Harper strip ended with issue 100, although a single strip just called ''Curley Harper'' appeared in issue #107. Later issues reprinted the Flash Gordon-like space adventures of ''[[Brick Bradford]]'' and ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' strip, both transferred from the ''King Comics'' title.

The ''Blondie'' strip also appeared in every issue of ''Ace Comics'', as did classic the humor strip ''[[The Katzenjammer Kids]]'' by [[Rudolph Dirks]]. Other humor strips included ''[[Pete the Tramp]]'' by [[Clarence D. Russell]], ''[[Tillie the Toiler]]'' by [[Russ Westover]], [[Billy DeBeck]]'s ''[[Barney Google and Snuffy Smith|Barney Google]]'', [[Jimmy Hatlo]]'s ''[[They'll Do It Every Time]]'' and [[Paul Robinson (comics)|Paul Robinson]]'s ''[[Etta Kett]]'' were presented throughout the run, although all of these titles missed the odd issue. The strip ''Seein' Stars'' which ran in the first 50 issues, was written by [http://lambiek.net/artists/b/beeman_arthur.htm Arthur Beeman] and was based around the Hollywood film industry — cartoon versions of a number of Hollywood stars, including [[Fred Astaire]], [[Betty Grable]] and [[Judy Garland]] guested.

Drawn in a similar style to [[Winsor McCay]]'s work, the fantasy strip ''The Pussycat Princess'' (a story originally titled ''Pussycat Princess, A Fairytale For Boys, Girls And Other Children''), by [http://lambiek.net/artists/d/drayton_g.htm Grace Drayton] and Ed Anthony, also featured in early issues of ''Ace Comics'' run. Drayton was a well-known and important early cartoonist who died only a year after starting this delightful fairytale series. Another classic Golden Age artist whose work appeared in a number of issues was [[C. C. Beck#Captain Marvel|C.C.Beck]] (creator of [[Fawcett Comics|Fawcett]]'s [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]). Six issues of ''Ace Comics'' contained single-page [http://www.toonopedia.com/tootsie.htm ''Captain Tootsie''] strips - advertisements for [[Tootsie Roll]] confectionery with a short adventure on the page, with a costume patterned on Captain Marvel's.

As well as syndicated strips, most issues also carried text stories,&lt;!--to qualify for magazine mailing rates--&gt; editorials, and factual pages. Many of the stories, such as ''White Buffalo'' in issues #35-36, were written by [[R. G. Montgomery]], who wrote short Western tales in magazines in the 1920s and 1930s. [[Ruth Plumly Thompson]], who wrote a number of the books in the ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|Oz]]'' series after [[L. Frank Baum]] died in 1919, also wrote a considerable number of editorial pages. ''Ace Comics'' also featured single-panel cartoons, probably the best known of which, [http://www.toonopedia.com/breger.htm ''Private Breger Abroad''], was drawn by celebrated World War II cartoonist [[Dave Breger]]. The factual strip ''[[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!]]'' was reprinted in early issues of ''Ace Comics'', while other factual pages, such as ''Stamp Spotlight'', ''Sports In Pictures'' and ''News In Pictures'', appeared regularly at various times during the run. Two series in 1941-2 covered the early events of World War II at sea — ''Battle of the Atlantic'' and ''Battle for the Seven Seas''. These were written and drawn by [[Edgar Franklin Wittmack]], known for his stylized magazine covers in the 1920s and 1930s.

An unusual feature for the day was the ''Young Reporters'' page, which included [[comic book letter column|readers' letters]] and comments. Competitions and prizes were also advertised in early numbers, and puzzle pages were also featured.

''Ace Comics'' was cancelled with issue #151 (October 1949), although as that issue contained an ad for the next ''Phantom'' series, it can be assumed the decision on cancellation was made after #151 left the printer.

Sami has been quoted as saying that the film is "history making, the first Muslim rom-com, so it's going to hopefully pave the way for many other similar stories, not just from the Muslim community but from other communities and minorities in our society." He said that the "affectionate and poignant story of love" was trying to cast a more positive light on Muslim-Australian life.&lt;ref name="disarm"/&gt;

== Plot ==
Ali ([[Osamah Sami]]), the charming and musically-talented son of a Muslim cleric ([[Don Hany]]), struggles to make the right life choices despite the best of intentions. He wants to be with the girl, Dianne ([[Helana Sawires]]), he loves, but he's been promised to another girl at his father's mosque. He wants to be the great doctor that the community expects him to be, but he doesn't get the marks. Above all, he wants to make his father proud. To live up to these impossible expectations, he lies about his academic achievements, and then his quest to please his father spirals out of control, with amusing and poignant consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ali's Wedding|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2782692/?ref_=nm_knf_t1|publisher=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began in vaudeville&lt;ref name=allmovie&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/augustus-carney-p285137 | publisher=AllMovie | title=Augustus Carney, Biography | last=Wollstein | first=Hans J. | accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entered films in 1909 with a featured role in a [[Ben Turpin]] comedy [[short film|short]], ''Tag Day''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0354954/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_132 | publisher=Internet Movie Database | title=Tag Day (1909) | accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been discovered by [[Broncho Billy Anderson]], one of the founders of [[Essanay Studios]], and was soon starring in comedy shorts for the studio. Beginning in 1910, he co-starred with [[Victor Potel]] in a series of shorts as the characters Hank and Lank (played by Carney and Potel, respectively).&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0138771/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 | publisher=Internet Movie Database | title=Augustus Carney (1870–1920) | accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series lasted for two years, after which Carney developed the character of "Alkali Ike." The character starred in its own series of shorts, such as 1911's ''[[Alkali Ike's Auto]]'' (which is still extant), and which co-starred [[Harry Todd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002610/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_103 | publisher=Internet Movie Database | title=Alkali Ike's Auto (1911) | accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as appearing in many of the popular episodes of the series of film shorts featuring "Broncho Billy", which were directed by and starred Anderson.&lt;ref name=imdb /&gt; He also appeared in the Broncho Billy series as other characters, such as Doctor A. Carney in 1911's ''Broncho Billy's Adventure'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001518/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_88 | publisher=Internet Movie Database | title=Broncho Billy's Adventure (1911) | accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a cowboy in 1911's ''Broncho Billy's Christmas Dinner''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001519/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_89 | publisher=Internet Movie Database | title=Broncho Billy's Christmas Dinner (1911) | accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alkali Ike series became so popular that Essanay began merchandising Ike action figures.&lt;ref name=allmovie/&gt; While the series was running, Carney starred in other shorts for Essanay, such as ''Hubby's Scheme'' (1911),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364418/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_91 | publisher=Internet Movie Database | title=Hubby's Scheme (1911) | accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1911's ''A Hungry Pair'' (again co-starring Potel),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373913/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_100 | publisher=Internet Movie Database | title=A Hungry Pair (1911) | accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Bandit's Child'' (1912 - which also starred Anderson and Todd),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375581/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_79 | publisher=Internet Movie Database | title=The Bandit's Child (1912) | accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Hypnotism in Hicksville'' (1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338116/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_54 | publisher=Internet Movie Database | title=Hypnotism in Hicksville (1913) | accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last appearance as Alkali Ike was released in January 1914, ''The Awakening at Snakeville''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0202804/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_27 | publisher=Internet Movie Database | title=The Awakening at Snakeville (1914) | accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he asked for a higher salary and was refused, Carney left Essanay and went to work at [[Universal Studios|Universal Film Manufacturing Company]] (now known as Universal Studios). There he created the character of "Universal Ike," which was identical to Alkali Ike, but that name was owned by Essanay.&lt;ref name=allmovie /&gt;  He made 16 films for Universal based on this character in 1914;&lt;ref name=imdb /&gt; however, his requests for additional pay led to his being fired by Universal that same year.&lt;ref name=allmovie /&gt; After his departure from Universal, he made several more shorts at various studios and appeared in only four feature films in 1915-16. Three of those features, ''The Absentee'' (1915), ''The Failure'' (1915), and ''[[Martyrs of the Alamo]]'' (1915), were directed by [[Christy Cabanne]]. His final film appearance was in a supporting role in 1916's ''Blue Blood and Red'', which was directed by [[Raoul Walsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=13977 | title=Blue Blood and Red: Detail View | publisher=American Film Institute | accessdate= August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carney left the film industry in 1916 and died four years later in 1920 at the age of 50.&lt;ref name=allmovie /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2302">'''''Aztec Ace''''' is a comic title formerly published by [[Eclipse Comics]]. Originally written by [[Doug Moench]] and pencilled by [[Dan Day]], 15 issues appeared from 1984 to 1985.&lt;ref name= "chills"&gt;{{cite news |last=McCulloch |first=Joe |url= http://www.tcj.com/this-week-in-comics-32311-multifarious-chills/ |title=THIS WEEK IN COMICS! (3/23/11 – Multifarious Chills!) |work=[[The Comics Journal]] |date=March 22, 2011 |accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The characters reappeared in the 1988 ''[[Total Eclipse (comic)|Total Eclipse]]'' comic series.) Other contributors to Aztec Ace were inker [[Nestor Redondo]], inker [[Ron Harris (artist)|Ron Harris]], artist [[Mike Gustovich]], artist [[Tom Yeates]], colorist [[Philip DeWalt]], colorist [[Steve Oliff]], colorist [[Sam Parsons]], letterer [[Carrie Spiegle]], and Eclipse editor [[catherine yronwode|cat yronwode]]. The Aztec Ace logo was created by [[Denis McFarling]].

The story revolves around a time traveller named Ace (real name: Caza), whose goal is to save the timestream from unraveling through various intricate adventures. Ace is from the 23rd Century, with his base in pre-contact Aztec Mexico; he often visits ancient Egypt. His main enemy is Nine-Crocodile, who creates time paradoxes in an attempt to save his own dimension at the expense of other realities, especially, the modern world as we know it.

Characteristics of the series are time travel, the use of cultural icons such as political figures, historical situations, songs, and cult movies in unexpected situations, and philosophical musing. Historical renderings of ancient cultures were detailed and imaginative. Careful reading, broad knowledge, and patience were required of the reader, as well as some understanding of the ongoing storyline, all of which possibly prevented it from gathering a large following.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5565">'''Bevis Hillier''' (born 28 March 1940) is an English [[art historian]], author and journalist. He has written on [[Art Deco]], and also a [[biography]] of [[John Betjeman|Sir John Betjeman]].

==Life and work==
Hillier was born in [[Redhill, Surrey]]. His father was [[Jack Hillier (art historian)|Jack Hillier]], an authority and author on [[Japanese art]]. His mother was Mary Louise Hillier, an authority on wax dolls and [[automata]]. Hillier was educated at [[Reigate Grammar School]] and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], where he won the Gladstone Memorial Prize for History. He was employed as a [[journalist]] on ''[[The Times]]'' from 1963. He has since been a reviewer for ''[[The Spectator]]''.

In 1968 Hillier's book ''[[Art Deco of the 20s and 30s]]'' was published by Studio Vista. This was the first major work on a hitherto neglected genre of art that had previously been referred to as [[Art Moderne]] (The term ''Art Moderne'' has since come to be used to refer to the later ''streamlined'' style of Art Deco in the 1930s.). Hillier's use of the term ''[[Art Deco]]'' became definitive. In 1971 Hillier curated a major Art Deco show at the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]], which helped to increase popular awareness of this style.

In 1969 Studio Vista published Hillier's ''Cartoons and Caricatures'', a study of  caricature from the 13th century to the late 20th. Hillier has also written books on ceramics and posters, as well as ''The Style of the Century'' (1983), a review of the various styles of art in the 20th century, from [[Art Nouveau]] through [[psychedelia]] and [[pop art]] to [[Punk art|punk]]. 

Hillier's major work, however, is the authorised biography of Sir [[John Betjeman]]. It took Hillier 25 years to research and write, and was published by [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] in three volumes (1988, 2002 and 2004). A one-volume abridgement was published in 2006 for Betjeman's centenary.

==Betjeman letter hoax==
In August 2006 a rival biography of Betjeman was published by [[A. N. Wilson]]. It was later discovered to contain a hoax letter, purportedly by Betjeman, but actually containing an [[acrostic]] insulting  Wilson. The letter had been sent to Wilson by "Eve de Harben", an anagram of "Ever been had?", and the first letters of each sentence, beginning with the second sentence, spelled out the message "A.N. Wilson is a shit." Hillier was an immediate suspect for the [[literary forgery]]: the ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'' article revealing the hoax was accompanied by a prominent picture of Hillier and noted that an envelope containing a letter supposedly from de Harben to the newspaper had been bought in [[Winchester]], his home town.&lt;ref name="hoax"&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2006-08-28  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hillier initially denied responsibility, but soon admitted that he had written the letter. He explained that he had been angered by Wilson's negative review of the second volume of his biography of Betjeman, and by pre-publication publicity for Wilson's own biography.&lt;ref name="hoax-confession"&gt;{{cite news

'''Bidone d'Oro''', [[Italian language|Italian]] for the "Golden Bin" or "Golden Trashcan", was a [[tongue-in-cheek]] prize given to the most disappointing player in [[Serie A]] at the end of each calendar year.

'''''Blaster Master 2''''' is a [[video game]] developed by [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]] and published exclusively in [[North America]] by [[Sunsoft|Sunsoft of America]] for the [[Sega Genesis]] on March 15, 1993. The game is a [[sequel]] to the original ''[[Blaster Master]]'' originally published for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It was published specifically for the [[North America]]n market following the success of the first NES game in the same region. The staff of the original Japanese version of ''Blaster Master'', titled ''Chô Wakusei Senki Metafight'', had nothing to do with ''Blaster Master 2'', and Sunsoft Japan did not release BM2 in Japan.

== Plot ==
The game takes place four years after Jason's Encounter with the Plutonium Boss and the [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] mutants under the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="MobyGames"&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/blaster-master-2 ''Blaster Master 2''] at [[MobyGames]]&lt;/ref&gt; His only reminder of the incident is [[SOPHIA (vehicle)|S.O.P.H.I.A.]], the vehicle he used to stop them, which he has hidden in an abandoned barn. One day, one bolt of lightning struck the house and caused the ceiling to crumble, knocking Jason [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]]. When Jason woke up, S.O.P.H.I.A. was in pieces and the parts he had collected from his first dealings with the Mutant Bosses were missing. Little does Jason know that there are more lightning beings where the first one came from and they are planning to destroy the Earth. The beings started digging towards the Earth's core in order to shift the planet's weight off its axis, leading to total [[annihilation]]. The parts from SOPHIA are being used to create a robotic army to assist the being in accomplishing their mission.&lt;ref name="MobyGames"/&gt; Now, Jason must stop them, but he won't make it without the help of SOPHIA. Since he can't recover the parts, he decided to redesign it to better prepare himself for the ordeal facing him. After 29 days, SOPHIA was completely rebuilt and ready for battle.&lt;ref name="MobyGames"/&gt; Remembering where he saw the being's footsteps, Jason jumped in his vehicle and headed towards the mountains where the challenge begins.

=== Characters ===
'''Jason Frudnick''' - He is the protagonist throughout the ''Blaster Master'' series. He is the character that accidentally discovered SOPHIA while trying to retrieve his pet frog Fred. In ''Blaster Master 2'', Jason is young (age 19) and couldn't have been more prepared for battle. His job is to eliminate the Plutonium Boss once and for all. Jason's equipment is fairly simple in ''Blaster Master 2''. He is wearing body armor that has moderate protection from heat and impact. Jason also comes with his usual blast cannon that is equipped onto his left arm brace. It does not overheat, and has unlimited energy. In ''Blaster Master 2'', Jason is mostly seen inside SOPHIA's canopy, but can easily hop out at any time in the game when in the sidescroll view. Jason does not take impact from falling too well in BM2, but when in the "Jason view" he does not take damage from falling impact. Jason is more easily seen in detail when challenging a boss or even an underboss. He is approximately ten times larger in this view.

'''[[SOPHIA (vehicle)|S.O.P.H.I.A.]]''' (sometimes referred to as '''SOPHIA''') - The robotic, combat tank-like vehicle used throughout the ''Blaster Master'' series. SOPHIA comes in many different models, and the one that is seen in ''Blaster Master 2'' is SOPHIA 4th (2000). The model has been rebuilt by Jason and has many new and helpful features from the previous models of SOPHIA ([[SOPHIA (vehicle)#SOPHIA 3rd .28Nora MA-01.29|SOPHIA Nora MA-01]], [[SOPHIA (vehicle)#SOPHIA 3rd .28Nora MA-02.29|SOPHIA Nora MA-02]]).

== Gameplay ==
Under the development team of Software Creations and the marketing team at [[Sunsoft|Sunsoft of America]], several things were altered in the new ''Blaster Master 2'' game, such as the name of the vehicle (now "S.O.P.H.I.A."), as well as significantly expanded gameplay. There are now 8 levels to play through, and each level containing a [[power-up]] or new obtainable weapon in which Jason or SOPHIA can use throughout the game. The platform-jumping characteristics that made the [[Blaster Master|original]] [[NES]] game so popular among fans were preserved, while other viewpoints provided an additional level of gameplay unique to BM2 alone. There were now three ways to play: sidescroll view (S.O.P.H.I.A. and Jason), overhead view (S.O.P.H.I.A.), and Jason running through rooms (with a large view, and a small view with Jason running through certain parts of the stages).

=== Sidescroll view ===
[[Image:Bm2 sideview.jpg|100px|left|Normal view of SOPHIA]]In the sidescroll view, players battled through levels just like in ''[[Blaster Master]]'', except in 16-bit graphics. Jason could get powerups such as homing missile, three-way missiles, bubble shield, and lightning spread.
&lt;div style="clear:left;height:0px"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Overhead view ===
[[Image:Bm2 topview.jpg|100px|left|Overhead view of SOPHIA]]In the overhead view, S.O.P.H.I.A. can not use upgrades, but instead could rotate the turret 360 degrees while the player runs through obstacles and gunfire. S.O.P.H.I.A. rotates her turret differently than when in the sidescroll view. A tap of the B and C buttons on the Genesis controller will rotate left and right.
&lt;div style="clear:left;height:0px"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Jason view ===
[[Image:Bm2 jasonboss.jpg|100px|left|Large view of Jason]]During the course of the game, Jason could enter several rooms, one of which may contain a mini-boss (such as a giant bee or worm) that he must fight in order to gain a powerup or key that will let him enter the next stage. Sometimes these mini-bosses will give Jason or S.O.P.H.I.A. a powerup that enhances their abilities. For example, Jason can get a jetpack, or missile launcher. S.O.P.H.I.A. can get a hover module, or a drill that can break through stone.
&lt;div style="clear:left;height:0px"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

== Reviews ==
''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' scored the game 7 out of 10. Their four reviewers were divided about the game; one hailed it as having "better graphics, better sounds, and better play" than the original ''Blaster Master'', one expressed disappointment over the removal of some of the original's power-ups but judged it an overall solid sequel, and the remaining two felt the game to be merely average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Blaster Master 2|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=47|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=June 1993|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Blizzard Man''''' is a skit by [[Andy Samberg]] on American television program on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. The skit prominently features Samberg as the title character, who is brought in recording studios to assist musicians with an in-progress song, only for them to find that his musical ability is limited to a cheesy parody of serious [[rap music]]. Despite this, the skit always concludes with the artists recording with him anyway. Guests stars for the skit in the past have included [[Ludacris]], [[T-Pain]], [[P. Diddy]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], and [[2 Chainz]] as themselves and [[Tim McGraw]] and [[Robert De Niro]] playing fictional characters.

==Format==
The skit's premise is typically that a music producer&lt;ref name="billboard.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/viral-videos/949701/watch-diddy-grinds-with-robert-deniro-on-snl|title=Watch: Diddy Grinds With Robert DeNiro on 'SNL'|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is looking for additional talent in recording a [[rap music|rap song]] with another musician. The producer will suggest recruiting Blizzard Man for help. Typically the producer speaks very highly of Blizzard Man, making bold claims such as that his rapping rivals other popular artists, such as [[Trey Songz]] or [[Bruno Mars]], only to see that Blizzard Man looks like [[Vanilla Ice]], has terrible vocals and laughable lyrics.&lt;ref name="billboard.com"/&gt; To make things worse, he often uses  nonsensical 1990s-inspired catchphrases such as "Word is bond" and "What it do?" while alluding to similarly outdated things such as [[Jordache|Jordache jeans]] or claiming that it is actually 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://certifiedrandom.com/articles/snl-ludacris-replaces-t-pain-with-blizzard-man/2278 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625111935/http://certifiedrandom.com/articles/snl-ludacris-replaces-t-pain-with-blizzard-man/2278 |archivedate=June 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the character is in the recording musician role and [[Kenan Thompson]], playing a recording engineer in the studio, right away strongly opposes Blizzard Man's music and mannerisms, but as the skit progresses, they are eventually swayed by Blizzard Man's performances (which, in reality, never change or actually get better), and the enthusiasm of the producer.&lt;ref name="rapdirt.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rapdirt.com/ludacris-and-t-pain-meet-blizzard-man/17924/|title=Ludacris And T-Pain Meet Blizzard Man |website=Rapdirt.com|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episodes==
===November 18, 2006===
In the original skit, ''Saturday Night Live'' cast members [[Jason Sudeikis]] and [[Maya Rudolph]] play record producers, and [[Ludacris]] guest stars, as himself, as a musician who acknowledges he needs help with his newest recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/06/06fblizzard.phtml|title=SNL Transcripts: Ludacris: 11/18/06: The Blizzard Man|website=Snltranscripts.jt.org|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the later variations of the skit, the musician, Ludacris, is trying to convince the record producers that Blizzard Man should be utilized as a musician. Ludacris ultimately succeeds in convincing them.

===January 20, 2007===
[[Jeremy Piven]] guest stars as the music producer who supports Blizzard Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/afi/280920|title=AFI|website=Tvguide.com|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Common (rapper)|Common]] guest stars as the musician who initially opposes, but eventually embraces, recording with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/758/758352p1.html|title=Saturday Night Live: "Jeremy Piven / AFI" Review|first=By Larry|last=Carroll|website=Tv.ign.com|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside SNL===
In 2007, to promote Ludacris donating a motorcycle to a charity auction, he and Samberg created an additional skit, not shown on SNL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ebay.com/usr/harley-supports-ludacris-foundation |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616030551/https://www.ebay.com/usr/harley-supports-ludacris-foundation |archive-date=2018-06-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The skit involves Ludacris looking for a rapper to advertise for said auction, which results with him eventually deciding on Blizzard Man's song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2007/05/prweb526645.htm|title=Live eBay Auction Offering Brand New 2007 Harley-Davidson FLSTF Fat Boy Motorcycle, Proceeds to Benefit The Ludacris Foundation|website=Prweb.com|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Reception for the skit has been mostly positive, especially the episode featuring Robert De Niro. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' called it a "home run", especially praising De Niro's role in drag as Blizzard Man's mother.&lt;ref name="billboard.com"/&gt; [[MTV]] also praised it, calling it "one of the highlights of the episode," especially the prospect of Diddy and De Niro flirting with each other.&lt;ref name="mtv.com"/&gt; [[Movieline]] was positive as well, calling it one of the De Niro's sketches that "delivered A-material".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movieline.com/2010/12/06/who-scored-big-in-week-eight-of-snls-not-ready-for-prime-time-player-relevancy-poll/|title=Who Scored Big in Week Eight of SNL's Not-Ready-for-Prime-Time-Player Relevancy Poll?|first=Mike|last=Ryan|date=6 December 2010|website=Movieline.com|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''PopCrunch'' said of the skit, "nobody does dorky white rapper like Samberg",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.popcrunch.com/watch-snl-blizzard-man-diddy-robert-de-niro-video/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211025033/http://tv.popcrunch.com/watch-snl-blizzard-man-diddy-robert-de-niro-video/ |archivedate=February 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Huffington Post]] used the skit as an example of how legendary actor Robert De Niro never got sillier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/05/blizzard-man-robert-de-ni_n_792235.html|title=WATCH: Robert De Niro Grinds With Diddy In 'SNL' Sketch|date=5 December 2010|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zap2it]] described it as "kind of hilarious" and concluded "we gotta give props to Diddy hitting on him (her) and declaring, 'If you weren't my man's mom, I'd tear that ass up.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/12/saturday-night-live-robert-de-niro-gets-help-from-ben-stiller.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208042538/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/12/saturday-night-live-robert-de-niro-gets-help-from-ben-stiller.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 December 2010|title=&amp;apos;Saturday Night Live&amp;apos;: Robert De Niro gets help from Ben Stiller|date=5 December 2010|website=Blog.zap2it.com|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ''Blizzard Man'' sketches were praised as well. ''Prefix Mag'' called the T Pain, Ludacris, and Tim McGraw episode "hilarious" and urged readers to watch it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/t-pain-and-ludacris-meet-the-blizzard-man-on-snl-v/23295/|title=T-Pain and Ludacris meet The Blizzard Man on SNL (Video)|website=Prefixmag.com|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Blood Bowl''''' is a [[fantasy football (board games)|fantasy football]] [[video game]] developed by [[Cyanide (company)|Cyanide]], loosely based on [[American football]], and adapted from the [[Blood Bowl|board game of the same name]], which is produced by [[Games Workshop]], using the [[Blood Bowl#Living Rulebook|CRP]] ruleset.&lt;ref name=gameshark/&gt;

==Gameplay==
The game is a [[fantasy]] version of American football, played between two teams of up to 16 players, each team fielding up to 11 players at a time. [[Touchdown]]s are scored by taking the ball into the opposition's end zone, and a team can win either by scoring the most touchdowns, or by violently eliminating the other team's entire roster.&lt;ref name=gameshark&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameshark.com/features/569/Blood-Bowl-Q&amp;A-with-Cyanide-CEO-Patrick-Pligersdorffer.htm |title=Blood Bowl Q&amp;A with Cyanide CEO Patrick Pligersdorffer |author=Bill Abner |work=GameShark |date=2009-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221140628/http://www.gameshark.com/features/569/Blood-Bowl-Q%26A-with-Cyanide-CEO-Patrick-Pligersdorffer.htm |archivedate=2009-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has both [[real-time strategy|real-time]] and [[turn-based strategy]] modes.&lt;ref name=slayer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=Ryan |date=March 2008 |title=Football Slayer |journal=[[Games for Windows: The Official Magazine]] |issue=16 |pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players may choose to play the game in either mode.&lt;ref name=gameshark/&gt;  The Special Play cards are not included in the main game.&lt;ref name=gameshark2/&gt;

During the main career mode, the player must start from scratch and build a team; the career mode can go on ''ad infinitum''.&lt;ref name=gameshark2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameshark.com/features/574/Blood-Bowl-Q&amp;A-Part-II-Community-Questions.htm |title=Blood Bowl Q&amp;A Part II: Community Questions Answered |author=Bill Abner |work=GameShark |date=2009-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304203939/http://www.gameshark.com/features/574/Blood-Bowl-Q%26A-Part-II-Community-Questions.htm |archivedate=2009-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the team goes up in ranking on the tournament ladder, a player will sign better players for their roster.&lt;ref name=gameshark/&gt; If one or several of the roster players are injured or killed during a match, the player needs to replace them for one or several of the next matches until they are ready to go back to the field. If the player lacks money to heal them, they will still be able to play the injured player, but the chances that player is killed increases.&lt;ref name=gameshark/&gt;

Roster players take part in tournaments, where they gain experience and level up. The player can assign skill points to buy new abilities that will affect the player's performance, such as improving their dice rolls, have a second chance on a bad roll, and other bonuses along those lines.&lt;ref name=gameshark/&gt; Leagues are completely customizable: there are 25 elements can be edited by the user, such as teams, races, players, and championship rules. Players may also set up online tournaments with others in the online community, which also allows players to gain experience as with the single player mode.&lt;ref name=gameshark/&gt; Tournaments may have a minimum of four participants, and a maximum of 24; none of the teams may be AI-controlled.&lt;ref name=gameshark2/&gt; A player may play with a solo franchise team online, but may not use it in online tournaments or leagues.&lt;ref name=gameshark2/&gt; Players may not switch between RTS and turn-based modes mid-tournament.&lt;ref name=gameshark2/&gt; Players may create custom logos for their teams.&lt;ref name=gameshark2/&gt;

The Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable versions lack career league play and customization options. Multiplayer involves turn-based [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|hotseat]] gameplay on the handheld versions, though the PSP version also includes wireless multiplayer.&lt;ref name=gameshark/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The first release on both DS and PSP showed significant functional issues that prevented players to complete career mode as their data files were corrupted after a few hours of game play. A replacement service has since been provided to owners of the PSP version.&lt;ref&gt;Official Blood Bowl [https://web.archive.org/web/20110708215829/http://www.cyanide-studio.com/forumBB/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=4494  video game forum].&lt;/ref&gt; The Xbox version also suffered issues, such as in-game players not keeping experience they gained during games, making league play useless.&lt;ref name=xboxbugs&gt;http://forum.bloodbowl-game.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=952&lt;/ref&gt; The Xbox version was also dropped after the original version of the game.&lt;ref name=xboxbugs/&gt;

==Expansions==
[[File:Bloodbowl ds.jpg|right|thumb|French DS version.]]

In October 2009 Cyanide Studios announced a free expansion containing the [[Dark Elves (Warhammer)|Dark Elves]] race.&lt;ref name=darkelves&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodbowl-game.com/index.php?rub=news-info&amp;id=114 |title=The Dark Elves: soon available, for Free! |publisher=[[Cyanide (Studio)|Cyanide]] |work=Press Release |date=2009-10-23 |accessdate=2009-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026143248/http://www.bloodbowl-game.com/index.php?rub=news-info&amp;id=114 |archivedate=October 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Update was released on November 20, 2009&lt;ref name=DErelease&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloodbowl-game.com/index.php?rub=news-info&amp;id=118|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124083355/http://bloodbowl-game.com/index.php?rub=news-info&amp;id=118|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-11-24|title=Dark Elves: the free Add-on and the Video available now!|publisher=[[Cyanide (Studio)|Cyanide]]|work=Press Release|date=2009-11-19|accessdate=2009-11-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a free download&lt;ref name=darkelves/&gt;&lt;ref name=DErelease/&gt; and as an in-store release in Europe&lt;ref name=DErelease/&gt; with a strategy guide.&lt;ref name=DErelease/&gt;
A DLC featuring Dark Elves was released along with a title update for Xbox 360, but, while free on the PC, Microsoft chose to charge players for them on the Xbox 360.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyanide-studio.com/forumBB/viewtopic.php?f%3D4%26t%3D14433%26p%3D214649%26hilit%3Dxbox+360+update#p214649 |accessdate=February 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708215907/http://www.cyanide-studio.com/forumBB/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=14433&amp;p=214649&amp;hilit=xbox+360+update |title=Xbox 360 update|archivedate=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being approved in North America, the Xbox title update was not approved in the EMEA territories.

In April 2010, Cyanide announced the next version of the game, ''Blood Bowl: Legendary Edition'' would be released in November 2010, with 11 new teams (Amazon, Elf, Halfling, High Elf, Khemri, Necromantic, Norse, Nurgle, Ogre, Undead, and Vampire), and added bug and rules fixes,.&lt;ref&gt;http://kotaku.com/5508157/blood-bowl-goes-legendary-with-twelve-new-teams&lt;/ref&gt; BB:LE is based on the current [[Blood Bowl#Living Rulebook|CRP]] rule set, and contains 21 of the 24 BBRC (Blood Bowl Rules Committee) official rosters. The missing races are [[Chaos Dwarfs]], Chaos Pact and Slann.

In May 2012, Cyanide and Focus announced the next version of the game, ''Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition'' would be released, with 3 new teams (2 from the rules - Chaos Dwarves and Underworld, and a third made completely up by them - Daemons of Khorne), 2 additional star players and a new stadium.(Note: Two teams were still left out of the game: Chaos Pact and Slann).&lt;ref&gt;http://forum.bloodbowl-game.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=1258&lt;/ref&gt; Cyanide Studios have also released an adaptation of [[Dungeonbowl]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyanide-studio.com/games/dungeonbowl/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221144140/http://cyanide-studio.com/games/dungeonbowl/ |archivedate=2013-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sequel, ''[[Blood Bowl 2]]'', was released in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/04/blood-bowl-2-coming-to-pc-ps4-and-xbox-one|title=Blood Bowl 2 coming to PC, PS4 and Xbox One|work=[[IGN]]|author=Chloi Rad|date=2014-12-04|accessdate=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:BloodBowl.jpg|left|thumb|Two players engaging in battle.]]
[[Cyanide (Studio)|Cyanide]] created a similar title, ''[[Chaos League]]'', in 2004. The similarity between ''Chaos League'' and Games Workshop's ''Blood Bowl'' led to a [[lawsuit]], which was settled out of court. One of the terms of the settlement was that Cyanide would receive a [[intellectual property license|license]] to develop a new title using the official ''Blood Bowl'' property.&lt;ref name=slayer/&gt;

In August 2007, [[Cyanide (Studio)|Cyanide]] announced that a new game for [[Microsoft Windows]] computers would be developed, due to be released in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Sinclair | first = Brendan | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Blood Bowl Blitzes | work = [[GameSpot]] | publisher = [[GameSpot]] | date = 2007-11-16 | url = http://www.gamespot.com/news/618067.html | doi = | accessdate = 2007-11-16 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 14, 2007, the [[Nintendo DS]], [[PlayStation Portable]], and [[Xbox 360]] versions were announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Dobson | first = Jason | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Cyanide confirms Blood Bowl for Xbox 360, PSP, DS | work = [[Joystiq]] | publisher = [[Joystiq]] | date = 2007-11-13 | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2007/11/14/cyanide-confirms-blood-bowl-for-xbox-360-psp-ds | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2007-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally believed the game would be on [[Xbox Live Arcade]], but it was revealed to be a store release title.&lt;ref name=gameshark2/&gt; A limited playable version of the game was demonstrated at the Blood Bowl Grand Tournament in [[Nottingham]] over the weekend of the May 10, 2008. On December 18, 2008 it was announced on the Cyanide Blood Bowl forum by a Focus employee that the release date had been pushed back to Q2 2009 (June).&lt;ref name=Q2&gt;{{cite web|title=Release date, new site |publisher=[[Cyanide (Studio)|Cyanide]] |url=http://www.cyanide-studio.com/forumBB/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=105 |accessdate=2008-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203070421/http://www.cyanide-studio.com/forumBB/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=105 |archivedate=February 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PC version was made available for digital download on June 26, 2009.

On June 25, 2008, a trailer was released featuring the opening cinematic and some gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloodbowl-game.com/news/news.php?id=5&amp;lang=en Blood Bowl trailer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyanide Studios received permission from Games Workshop to include a real-time mode in the game, providing the developer strictly adhered to the Living Rulebook 5.0's rules; it was Cyanide's success with ''Chaos League'' that gave Games Workshop the confidence to allow them to adapt the rules to real-time gameplay.&lt;ref name=gameshark/&gt;

===Digital Rights Management===
The PC version of Blood Bowl has [[SecuROM]] [[digital rights management]] technology.  [[SecuROM]] exists in both the DVD retail box release and the digital download releases, including digital download distributions from both [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[Impulse (content delivery)|Impulse]] content delivery services.&lt;ref name=Steam&gt;{{cite web |title=Blood Bowl Dark Elves Edition on Steam |publisher=[[Steam (software)|Steam]] |url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/11170/ |accessdate=2010-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606053317/http://store.steampowered.com/app/11170 |archivedate=2010-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Impulse&gt;{{cite web| title = Impulse Driven : Blood Bowl - Dark Elves Edition | publisher = [[Impulse (content delivery)|Impulse]] | url = http://www.impulsedriven.com/bloodbowl | accessdate = 2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An activation code is provided with the game, and there is a specific uninstallation program installed which can be used to revoke the licence for further use.

==Reception==
''Blood Bowl'' was better received on the PC than on consoles. The PC version has online options that the Xbox 360 lacks, and the DS and PSP versions lack any sort of career mode.

On the PC, the game scored a [[Metacritic]] average of 72%. On Xbox 360 and PSP it only managed a 61% average, and on Nintendo DS a 52%.

GameZone's Steven Hopper gave the Xbox 360 version a 6.5/10, saying "Blood Bowl is a missed opportunity as evidenced by the potential of the source on which it's based. If you really want to get into the depth and fun of Blood Bowl, you're better off checking out the board game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r1288.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227083403/http://xbox360.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r1288.htm |archivedate=2010-02-27 |df= }} GameZone&lt;/ref&gt;

IT Reviews pointed out that on the Xbox 360, ''Blood Bowl'' had a "flaccid and pointless-seeming real-time mode, rough presentation, [and] a lack of online options compared to the PC."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itreviews.co.uk/games/g651.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115233052/http://www.itreviews.co.uk/games/g651.htm |archivedate=2010-11-15 |df= }} IT Reviews&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the PC version, PC Powerplay magazine commented that: "Despite some presentation concerns the rest of what was on offer during this match was truly thrilling." PC Gamer magazine also agreed, saying: "If you can penetrate the mysteries of its boardgame-based rules, Blood Bowl can offer true barbaric happiness."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1086">The '''Bolo bat''' was a  child's [[toy]] popular in the 1930s through the 1960s. It consisted of a round wooden paddle-like bat with a handle, not unlike a [[ping-pong paddle]], attached to the center of which was a piece of elastic band about three feet long. Attached to end of the elastic band was a rubber ball about an inch in [[diameter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Pop Bottles | url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/cm/cmarchive/vol15no6/popbottles.html | accessdate = 2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The child would bat the ball as far as the elastic would allow it to travel. When it reached the furthest distance from the bat that the elastic would allow, it sprang back at the bat where it was hit again and again. The object of the game was to see how many times the child could hit the ball and have it return and be hit again. Children competed against themselves and others for the greatest number of successful hits.

This is possibly the same thing as a [[paddle ball]].

'''Chinese whispers''' ([[Commonwealth English]]) or the '''telephone game''' ([[American English]]) &lt;ref name="Blackmore"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Meme Machine|last=Blackmore|first=Susan J.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2000|isbn=0-19-286212-X|page=x|quote=The form and timing of the tic undoubtedly mutated over the generations, as in the childhood game of Chinese Whispers (Americans call it Telephone)}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an internationally popular [[children's game]] &lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.oed.com|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which players form a line, and the first player comes up with a message and whispers it to the ear of the second person in the line. The second player repeats the message to the third player, and so on. When the last player is reached, they announce the message they heard to the entire group. The first person then compares the original message with the final version. Although the objective is to pass around the message without it becoming garbled along the way, part of the enjoyment is that, regardless, this usually ends up happening. Errors typically accumulate in the retellings, so the statement announced by the last player differs significantly from that of the first player, usually with amusing or humorous effect. Reasons for changes include anxiousness or impatience, erroneous corrections, the difficult-to-understand mechanism of whispering, and that some players may deliberately alter what is being said to guarantee a changed message by the end of the line.

The game is often played by children as a party game or on the playground.  It is often invoked as a [[metaphor]] for cumulative error, especially the inaccuracies as rumours or gossip spread,&lt;ref name="Blackmore" /&gt; or, more generally, for the unreliability of human recollection or even [[oral tradition]]s.

==Etymology==
As the game is popular among children worldwide, it is also known under various other names depending on locality, such as ''Russian scandal'',&lt;ref&gt;Gryski, Camilla (1998). ''Let's Play: Traditional Games of Childhood'', p.36. Kids Can. {{ISBN|1550744976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''whisper down the lane'', ''broken telephone'', ''operator'', ''grapevine'', ''gossip'', ''don't drink the milk'', ''secret message'', ''the messenger game'', and ''pass the message'' among others.&lt;ref name="Blackmore" /&gt; In France, it is called ''téléphone arabe'' (Arabic telephone) or ''téléphone sans fil'' (wireless telephone).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A9l%C3%A9phone_arabe|title=Téléphone arabe|author=|date=|website=fr.wikipedia.org|accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2018}} In Malaysia, this game is commonly referred to as ''telefon rosak'', which translates to broken telephone. In the United States, the game is known under the name ''telephone'' – which in this use is never shortened to the colloquial and more common word ''phone''.

Historians trace Westerners' use of the word ''Chinese'' to denote "confusion" and "incomprehensibility" to the earliest contacts between Europeans and Chinese people in the 17th century, and attribute it to Europeans' inability to understand China's culture and worldview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dale|first=Corinne H.|title=Chinese Aesthetics and Literature: A Reader|year=2004|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=New York|isbn=0-7914-6022-3|pages=15–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Using the phrase "Chinese whispers" suggested a belief that the [[Chinese language]] itself is not understandable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fabulous Orients: fictions of the East in England, 1662–1785 |isbn=0-19-926733-2 |first=Rosalind  |last=Ballaster  |pages=202–3 |quote=The sinophobic name points to the centuries-old tradition in Europe of representing spoken Chinese as an incomprehensible and unpronounceable combination of sounds. |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally Chinese people have historically been stereotyped by Westerners as secretive or inscrutable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmwr2yIuZj8C&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=inscrutable%20chinese&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Crosstalk and Culture in Sino-American Communication|last=Young|first=Linda W. L.|date=1994-05-26|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521416191|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more fundamental [[metonymy|metonymic]] use of the name of a foreign language to represent a broader class of situations involving foreign languages or difficulty of understanding a language is also captured in older idioms, such as "[[Greek to me|It's all Greek to me]]". 

The game has no winner: the entertainment comes from comparing the original and final messages. Intermediate messages may also be compared; some messages will become unrecognizable after only a few steps.

As well as providing amusement, the game can have educational value.  It shows how easily information can become corrupted by indirect communication. The game has been used in schools to simulate the spread of gossip and its supposed harmful effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nelson English Bk. 2 Teachers' Resource Book |first=John |last=Jackman |author2=Wendy Wren |isbn=0-17-424605-6 |publisher=Nelson Thornes |year=1999 |chapter=Skills Unit 8: the Chinese princess |quote=Play 'Chinese Whispers' to demonstrate how word-of-mouth messages or stories quickly become distorted}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also be used to teach young children to moderate the volume of their voice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Because We're Worth It: Enhancing Self-esteem in Young Children |first=Margaret |last=Collins  |page=55  |isbn=1-873942-09-5 |year=2001 |publisher=Sage |quote=Explain that speaking quietly can be more effective in communication than shouting, although clarity is important.  You could play "Chinese Whispers" to illustrate this! }}&lt;/ref&gt; and how to listen attentively;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=music works: music education in the classroom with children from five to nine years |first=Kathie  |last=Barrs |year=1994   |publisher=Belair |isbn=0-947882-28-6 |page=48 |quote=Listening skills:...Play Chinese Whispers}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this case, a game is a success if the message is transmitted accurately with each child whispering rather than shouting. It can also be used for older or adult learners of a foreign language, where the challenge of speaking comprehensibly, and understanding, is more difficult because of the low volume, and hence a greater mastery of the fine points of pronunciation is required.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Hill, op. cit.; or {{cite book |title=Lernpunkt Deutsch.: students' book |first=Peter  |last=Morris |author2=Alan Wesson |page=viii |isbn=0-17-440267-8  |publisher=Nelson Thornes |year=2000 |quote=Simple games for practising vocabulary and/or numbers: ... Chinese Whispers: ...the final word is compared with the first to see how similar (or not!) it is. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
A variant of Chinese whispers is called Rumors. In this version of the game, when players transfer the message, they ''deliberately'' change one or two words of the phrase (often to something more humorous than the previous message). Intermediate messages can be compared. What an individual player changes in the message often says something about the player.{{says who|date=August 2017}}

The pen-and-paper game Telephone Pictionary (also known as Eat Poop You Cat) is played by alternately writing and illustrating captions, the paper being folded so that each player can only see the previous participant's contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7NkUJPvgpl0C&amp;pg=PT39|title=Parlour Games for Modern Families|first=Myfanwy|last=Jones|date=4 November 2010|publisher=Penguin Adult|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial boardgame versions ''Telestrations''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annarbor.com/entertainment/eat-poop-you-cat-telestrations-review/|title=Eat Poop You Cat: A silly, fun, and free party game|author=|date=|website=annarbor.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Cranium (board game)|Cranium Scribblish]]'' were both released in 2009. The game has also been implemented online at [[Broken Picture Telephone]], [[Drawception]] and other sites. 

A translation relay is a variant in which the first player produces a text in a given [[language]], together with a basic guide to understanding, which includes a lexicon, an [[interlinear gloss]], possibly a list of grammatical [[morpheme]]s, comments on the meaning of difficult words, etc. (everything except an actual translation). The text is passed on to the following player, who tries to make sense of it and casts it into his/her language of choice, then repeating the procedure, and so on. Each player only knows the translation done by his immediate predecessor, but customarily the relay master or mistress collects all of them. The relay ends when the last player returns the translation to the beginning player. The game has been played in the [[conlang]] community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kneequickie.com/kq/Polyglottal_Telephone&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cinema of Colombia''' refers to the [[film industry]] based in [[Colombia]]. Colombian cinema began in 1897 and has included silent films, animated films and internationally acclaimed movies. Government support included an effort in the 1970s to develop the state-owned Cinematographic Development Company (''Compañía de '''Fo'''mento '''Cine'''matográfico'' [[FOCINE]]) which helped produce some films yet struggled to maintain itself financially viable. FOCINE became defunct in 1993. In 1997 the [[Congress of Colombia|Colombian congress]] approved Law 397 of Article 46 or the [[General Law of Culture]] with the purpose of supporting the development of the Colombian film industry by creating a film promotion [[mixed fund]] called [[Corporación PROIMAGENES en Movimiento]] (PROIMAGES in motion Corporation).&lt;ref name=PROIMAGE&gt;[http://www.proimagenescolombia.com/new_site/secciones/proimagenes/origen.htm Proimagenes en Movimiento: Origen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825115247/http://www.proimagenescolombia.com/new_site/secciones/proimagenes/origen.htm |date=2007-08-25 }} {{es icon}} proimagenescolombia.com Accessed 26 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Congress also approved the [[Law of Cinema]] which helped to restart the cinematographic industry in Colombia.

== History ==
[[Image:Cinématographe Lumière.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Poster of a Lumiere Brothers movie]]
The history of Colombian cinema started in 1897 when the first [[Cinématographe]] arrived in the country, two years after the invention of cinematography by [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] in Paris. Back then the port city of [[Colón, Panama|Colón]] (in what today is [[Panama]] but was then part of Colombia), [[Barranquilla]], [[Bucaramanga]] and later arrived to the capital city of Colombia, [[Bogotá]], where in August of that same year the cinématographe was presented in the Municipal Theater (later demolished).

=== First years ===
Soon after the introduction of the cinematographe in Colombia, the country entered a civil war known as the [[Thousand Days' War]] causing the suspension of all film production. The first films usually portrayed nature and moments of the Colombian everyday life. The exhibition of these films was dominated by the [[Di Domenico brothers]] who owned the [[Salón Olympia]] in Bogotá. The Di Domenico Brothers also produced the first film documentary in Colombia called ''[[El drama del quince de Octubre]]'' (The Drama of October the fifteenth) which was intended to celebrate the centenary of the [[Battle of Boyacá]] and also narrated the assassination of General [[Rafael Uribe Uribe]], provoking controversy upon its release.&lt;ref name=LABLAA&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/todaslasartes/croci/croci07.htm Luis Ángel Arango Library: Fin del periodo "primitivo"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216213423/http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/todaslasartes/croci/croci07.htm |date=2010-02-16 }} {{es icon}} [[Luis Ángel Arango Library]] Accessed 26 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bajo el cielo.png|thumb|Photogram of the film ''[[Bajo el Cielo Antioqueño]]'' (1924–1925)]]

=== Silent films ===
{{see also|Silent film}}
[[File:La tragedia del silencio (1924).webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|''La tragedia del silencio'' (1924, fragment).]]
During the early years of Colombian Cinema film producers almost exclusively portrayed nature and everyday life in their films, until 1922, when the first fiction film appeared, titled [[María (1922 film)|''María'']] (no copies of this film exist anymore). The film was directed by [[Máximo Calvo Olmedo]], a Spanish immigrant who worked as film distributor in [[Panama]] and was hired to travel to the city of [[Cali]] where he would direct and manage the photography of this film based on the novel by [[Jorge Isaacs]], ''[[María (novel)|María]]''.&lt;ref name=LABLAA1&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/biografias/calvmaxi.htm Luis Ángel Arango Library: Calvo, Máximo; Biografía] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812233212/http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/biografias/calvmaxi.htm |date=2007-08-12 }} {{es icon}} [[Luis Ángel Arango Library]] Accessed 26 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another pioneer of Colombian cinema was [[Arturo Acevedo Vallarino]] a producer and theater director from [[Antioquia department|Antioquia]] who lived in Bogotá. After the introduction of foreign films and the fascination they caused in Colombia, theaters no longer were as profitable as they once were, and so Acevedo decided to found a film production company called ''[[Acevedo e Hijos]]'' (Acevedo and sons).&lt;ref name=LABLAA2&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/todaslasartes/croci/croci11a.htm Luis Ángel Arango Library: Entrevista con Gonzalo Acevedo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705094113/http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/todaslasartes/croci/croci11a.htm |date=2009-07-05 }} {{es icon}} [[Luis Ángel Arango Library]] Accessed 26 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Acevedo and sons has been the longest lasting production company in Colombia, existing from 1923 to 1946 and the only one to survive the 1930s' [[Great Depression]]. Acevedo and sons produced the films ''[[La tragedia del silencio]]'' (The Tragedy of Silence) in 1924 and ''[[Bajo el Cielo Antioqueño]]'' (Under the sky of Antioquia) in 1928. Under the Sky of Antioquia was financed by local magnate [[Gonzalo Mejía]]. The film was criticized for being elitist, despite of which it had a somewhat positive acceptance among the public. Films in Colombia were mostly based on themes such as Nature, folklore, and nationalism with some exceptions being literary adaptations. In 1926 the film ''[[Garras de oro]]'' (Claws of Gold) was released, it has the distinction of being based on a political issue, the [[separation of Panama from Colombia]], and for criticizing the role of the United States in the conflict, both bold firsts in Colombian cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Hernando Martínez Pardo, ''Historia del Cine Colombiano'', Editorial América Latina, pages 50 to 55 and 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1930s crisis ===
[[Image:Garrasdeoro.jpg|thumb|Photogram of the film: ''[[Garras de oro]]'' (1926)]]

In 1928 the Colombian company [[Cine Colombia]] purchased the [[Di Domenico]] film studios, which commercialized international films because of the great profits they promised. International films were preferred before Colombian films by the Colombian public. Because of this, from 1928 until 1940 there was only one film produced in Colombia: ''[[Al son de las guitarras]]'' (To the Rhythm of the Guitars) by [[Alberto Santa]] but it was never shown in theaters. Colombians were more interested in "[[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]" films. Colombian film industry enthusiasts did not have the money, technology or preparation needed to develop a national cinema. While Colombian movies were still silent, the international industry was already exploiting color and [[sound film]]s, thus putting the Colombian cinema in a considerable disadvantage.

In the 1940s a businessman from Bogotá called [[Oswaldo Duperly]] founded [[Ducrane Films]] and produced numerous films despite facing strong competition from [[Cinema of Argentina|Argentine]] and [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican cinema]] which after 1931 drafted to a third position in preference among Colombians.&lt;ref&gt;Cuadernos de cine colombiano Nº 23, pages 2–5 March 1987 Publicación periódica de la Cinemateca Distrital, Maria Elvira Talero y otros autores&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the only production company that survived was the Acevedo and sons until it closed in 1945.

During the 1950s [[Gabriel García Márquez]] and [[Enrique Grau]] attempted to restart the industry. In 1954 both artists, a writer and a painter respectively created a surrealistic [[short film]] ''[[La langosta azul]]'' (The Blue Lobster). Garcia Marquez continued in the industry as a scriptwriter while Grau continued painting.

=== 'Pornomiseria' cinema ===
[[Image:Poor-in-bogota.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Child on the street, one common scene used by the 'Pornomiseria' in the 1970s]]

The '[[Pornomiseria]]' (porno-misery) cinema surged during the 1970s to classify the films with a high content of poverty and human misery to make money and gain international recognition. The term was also used in neighboring countries such as Venezuela and Brasil and was intended to criticize the morality of the filmmakers taking this approach. The films that the critics were addressing had gained a lot of attention mainly in European Film Festivals and misrepresented the reality of Latin America. Films like ''[[Gamín]]'' (1978) by [[Ciro Durán]], a documentary film about children living on the streets, belong to this style and included opinions that were misleading or lacked serious investigation of the social problems they were portraying. This type of film-making was criticized by the [[Group of Cali]], a group of filmmakers mainly represented by [[:es:Carlos Mayolo|Carlos Mayolo]] and [[:es:Luis Ospina|Luis Ospina]], which produced the [[mockumentary]] "[[:es:Agarrando pueblo|Agarrando Pueblo]]" (1978), a satire of ''Pornomiseria'' films.

Critics of Pornomiseria argued that these films did not treat their subject with profoundness, but took a superficial approach to the issues. Pornomiseria cinema was especially popular in Colombia and Brazil.

=== Cinematographic Fomenting Company (FOCINE) ===
On July 28, 1978 the ''[[Compañía de Fomento Cinematográfico]]'' (FOCINE) (Cinematographic Fomenting Company) was established to administer the Cinematographic Fomenting Fund which had been created a year before, in 1977. FOCINE was first adjudicated to the [[Colombian Ministry of Communications]] which in a period of ten years supported 29 films and a number of short films and documentaries. Corruption in its administration led to the closing of FOCINE in 1993.&lt;ref name=COLARTE&gt;[http://www.colarte.com/actores/General/recuentoCine.asp COLARTE: Historia del cine en Colombia] {{es icon}} Colarte.com Accessed 27 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the work of Carlos Mayolo transcended and introduced new forms of film making into Colombian cinema with the exploration of unconventional languages. Gustavo Nieto Roa helped to develop comedies with an influence from Mexican cinema.

During the last decade of the 20th century, the Colombian government liquidated FOCINE forcing film makers to co-produce films with other countries, mainly from Europe and private capital investors. Despite this, some important productions developed, such as ''[[La estrategia del caracol]]'' (The Snail's Strategy) by Sergio Cabrera, which won numerous international prizes and managed to revive a national interest on national films. Another successful film director and producer was [[Víctor Gaviria]] who, with themes of social concern, created  ''[[La vendedora de rosas]]'' (The Rose Seller) which won many prizes and much recognition along with ''Bolívar soy yo'' (I Am Bolívar, 2002) by [[Jorge Alí Triana]].&lt;ref name=SEOFCINEMA&gt;[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2003/festival-reports/5th_ibero_american_film_fest/ Senses of Cinema: Rescuing the Image: The 5th Ibero-American Film Festival, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia] {{pt icon}} Senseofcinema.com Accessed 27 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law of Cinema ===
In 2003, the Colombian government passed the [[Law of Cinema]], which standardized help for local film production. Numerous films were sponsored by the government generating a success in the local box office such as ''[[Soñar no Cuesta Nada]]'' (Dreaming Costs Nothing) by [[Rodrigo Triana]] with 1,200,000 spectators, an unprecedented attendance at the time&lt;ref name=PROIMACOL&gt;[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2003/festival-reports/5th_ibero_american_film_fest/ Pro Imagenes Colombia: La taquillera Soñar no cuesta nada se lanza en DVD y gana premio del público en Chicago] {{es icon}} proimagenes colombia.com Accessed 27 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; or the film ''[[El colombian dream]]'' (The Colombian Dream, the last word being in English to highlight a play on the concept of the "[[American Dream]]") by [[Felipe Aljure]] which achieved technical innovations and employed a narrative never before seen in Colombian cinema.

Law 814 of 2003, also known as the Law of Cinema, was approved after a second debate in the Colombian senate. The senate established the funding of Colombian cinema through taxes collected from distributors, exhibitors and film producers. The collection was set up to be destined to support film producers, short films documentaries and public projects. Funds collected are administered by the PROIMAGENES Cinematographic Production [[Mixed Fund]].&lt;ref name="PROIMAGE"/&gt;

During the second term of President [[Álvaro Uribe Vélez]] the government presented a tax reform to cut funding to the Law of Cinema, the president was criticized for this&lt;ref&gt;Colombian newspaper ''[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]'', printed edition of August 20, 2006, pages 2.1 and 2.2&lt;/ref&gt; but the minister of Culture [[Elvira Cuervo de Jaramillo]] lobbied in the Ministry of Finance to impede this law from affecting the financial resources destined to Colombian cinema. The minister of Finance agreed to protect the benefits for the film industry.&lt;ref name=MINCULTURA&gt;[http://www.mincultura.gov.co/vbecontent/NewsDetail.asp?ID=554&amp;IDCompany=3 MINCULTURA: La Ley de Cine en propuesta de Reforma Tributaria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213021518/http://www.mincultura.gov.co/VBeContent/NewsDetail.asp?ID=554&amp;IDCompany=3 |date=2007-02-13 }} {{es icon}} mincultura.gov.co Accessed 26 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== International projection ==
Colombian cinema has had a very small presence in international events. Despite this, some documentaries during the 1970s had relative success, such as "''[[Chircales]]''" (1972) by [[Marta Rodríguez]] and Jorge Silva, which won international prizes and recognition.

During the 1990s Silva gained notoriety with the film ''[[La estrategia del caracol]]'' (The Strategy of the Snail) and [[Víctor Gaviria]] did so with his films ''[[Rodrigo D: No futuro]]'' (1990) and ''[[La vendedora de rosas]]'' (1998), which was nominated for a [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

In the 2000s (decade) actress [[Catalina Sandino Moreno]] was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for her acting in the Colombian American production ''[[Maria Full of Grace]]''. She was also nominated for best female acting at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] in 2004 and won, sharing it with actress [[Charlize Theron]].

== Documentary films ==
Documentary productions in Colombia have varied in quality.  Nevertheless, they have not seen wide distribution due to barriers which the film industry imposes regarding exhibition and distribution of material.  Viewers interested in approaching these audiovisual materials are rare.

During the 1970s, in the city of [[Cali]] there was a great "boom" not only in film but in the arts in general.  At that time the ''Grupo de Cali'' was formed, which would include [[Carlos Mayolo]], [[Luis Ospina]], [[Andrés Caicedo]], [[Oscar Campo]] and other documentarists and directors who portrayed a particular sense of place and reality through their work. At the same time, documentarists like [[Marta Rodríguez]] and Jorge Silva produced a seemingly unending array of documentaries that approached anthropology, portraying forms of life and realities unknown to many.

== Animated film ==
{{main|Animation in Colombia}}

The development of [[animated film]] in Colombia, as in the rest of Latin America, has been slow and irregular, and it is only in recent years that animation has begun to gain importance. The first initiatives in the country were around the 1970s, especially in the production of television commercials. Nonetheless it was at the end of the past decade that  [[Fernando Laverde]], considered the pioneer of [[stop motion]] animation in Colombia,&lt;ref&gt;''Patrimonio fílmico colombiano'', [http://www.patrimoniofilmico.org.co/noticias/044b.htm Perfil de Fernando Laverde]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; used experimental methods and limited resources to create short animated pieces that received national and international recognition. Bogota native Carlos Santa explored the world of animated film as fine arts and is considered the father of experimental animation in Colombia. In 1988 with the support of FOCINE&lt;ref&gt;''Revista Kinetoscopio'', Págs. 114, 115&lt;/ref&gt; Santa released his film ''[[El pasajero de la noche]]'' (The Passenger of the Night), and in 1994 ''[[La selva oscura]]'' (The Dark Jungle) at the [[Caracas Film Festival]]. Both films received critical recognition for their artistic and narrative merits. In 2010, Carlos Santa completed his first feature-length animated film ''"Los Extraños Presagios de León Prozak"'' (The Mysterious Presages of León Prozak) which premiered at the [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]]. In the 2000s (decade) there was renewed activity in Colombian animation thanks to the interest of a new generation in this genre and the emergence of new technology; in 2003 the animated full-length film ''[[Bolívar el héroe|Bolivar the Hero]]'' was released, and the [[LOOP festival of animation and video games]] was born, where the work of Colombian and Latin American animators is encouraged and awarded.

== Film festivals ==
Many film festivals take place in Colombia, but the two most important are the [[Cartagena Film Festival]], functioning every year since 1960, and the [[Bogotá Film Festival]], functioning every year since 1984, presenting Latin American and [[Cinema of Spain|Spanish]] movies.

'''Corgi Toys''' ([[trademark]]) is the name of a range of [[die-cast toy]] vehicles produced by [[Mettoy Playcraft Ltd.]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The body of this article is derived from information available in "The Great Book of Corgi" by Marcel Van Cleemput {{ISBN|1-872727-19-0}}, {{ISBN|978-1-872727-19-6}}.

The Mettoy (Metal Toy) company was founded in 1933 by [[German people|German]] [[émigré]] Philip Ullmann in [[Northampton]], England, where he was later joined by [[South African people|South African]]-born [[Germans in Africa|German]] Arthur Katz, who had previously worked for Ullmann at his toy company Tipp and Co of [[Nuremberg]]. They decided to market a range of toy vehicles as competition to [[Meccano]]'s [[Dinky Toy]]s [[model car|model vehicles]], which had dominated the British market for many years. Corgi Toys were introduced in the UK in July 1956 and were manufactured in [[Swansea]], [[Wales]], for 27 years before the company went into liquidation. A management buy-out re-formed the company as Corgi Toys Limited in March 1984. In 1989, the management sold the Corgi brand to Mattel and the factory was retained under the name of Microlink Industries Ltd. In 1995, Corgi regained its independence as a new company, [[Corgi Classics Limited]], and moved to new premises in Leicester.

The range was exported worldwide and sold in large numbers. Some of the best known and most popular models were of cars made famous in film and television such as the [[Batmobile]], [[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (car)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]] and [[James Bond]]'s [[Aston Martin DB5]] – which remains the largest selling toy car ever produced. Although the largest single vehicle type featured in the Corgi Toys range were models of cars from manufacturers around the world, this article sub-divides vehicles into genres, wherever possible, to allow a more detailed look at the variety of models produced by the company.

==Early history==
[[File:Nick's Pics 044.jpg|thumb|left|225px|204 Rover 90 and 205 Riley Pathfinder]]
Mettoy became established in [[Northampton]] and within six years of the company's founding, the Northampton factory had 600 employees.&lt;ref name="Indie-obit"&gt;{{cite news

A production plant was built at [[Fforestfach]] in [[Swansea]], [[South Wales]], to manufacture the new range of Corgi Toys. This provided many new jobs in an area of high unemployment following the scaling down of local coal mining operations.&lt;ref name="V&amp;A1"&gt;

Prior to the introduction of Corgi Toys, Mettoy mainly produced tin plate toys. However, in the early 1950s, they began producing a few products in cast metal. The first was a large scale wind-up racer made with a cast aluminum body and tin plate wheels. The body material was soon changed to die cast zinc and it was refitted with cast wheels and moulded rubber tyres. Other models followed and the product line was given the name "Castoys." These were the direct ancestors of Corgi Toys. 
[[File:Nick's Pics 045.jpg|thumb|right|305 [[Triumph TR3]]]]
The name 'Corgi Toys' was chosen by Philip Ullmann in honour of the company's new home, taken from the Welsh breed of dog, the [[Welsh Corgi|Corgi]], and the iconic Corgi dog logo branded the new range. The name was short and easy to remember, further aligning the range with their rival Dinky Toys. Corgi Toys also included plastic glazing,&lt;ref name=Autocar196712/&gt; which lent the models a greater authenticity, and they carried the advertising slogan "the ones with windows".

The 1956 releases were all familiar British vehicles. Six family saloon cars; [[Ford Consul]] (200/200M), [[Austin A50 Cambridge]] (201/201M), [[Morris Cowley]] (202/202M), [[Vauxhall Velox]] (203/203M), [[Rover 90]] (204/204M), [[Riley Pathfinder]] (205/205M) and [[Hillman Husky]] (206/206M),&lt;ref name=Autocar196712&gt;{{cite magazine| authorlink = Eoin Young (Maurice A Smith - Ed)| title = Corgi's miniature motor industry|magazine=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume =  127 nbr 3749| pages =26–27 |date = 21 December 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two sports cars; [[Austin-Healey 100]] (300) and [[Triumph TR2]] (301). 

Initially, all models were issued in free-rolling form, or with friction drive motors, with the exception of the heavy commercials which would have been too bulky and the sports cars whose low slung bodies would not be able to accommodate the motors. The Mechanical versions, as they were known, were indicated by an 'M' suffix to the model number and were available in different colour schemes. They were issued with tougher die-cast bases to support the extra weight of the motor, and in far fewer numbers. Mechanical versions did not sell particularly well, partly due to a significantly higher purchase price, and were phased out in 1960 with [[Ford Thunderbird]] (214M) the last of the line.

==Expansion and innovation==
[[File:Nick's Pics 047.jpg|thumb|left|309 Aston Martin DB4 Competition Model]]

British cars dominated the releases over the next few years reflecting the company's concentration on the home market, but by  1957 new markets were being explored and the first European car to be modelled was the [[Citroën DS19]] (210) issued in December of that year. The first American car, the [[Studebaker Golden Hawk]] (211/211M), was released in February 1958 and by the early 1960s the Corgi range was being exported widely, finding particular popularity in Europe, Australia, Canada, the United States of America and areas of southeast Asia such as Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, and gradually more foreign vehicles were included to appeal to these new markets.
[[File:Nick's pics 067.jpg|thumb|right|200px|241 Ghia L6.4]]
Models were issued on a monthly basis and the range grew quickly to include vehicles of all types. Gradually the models became more sophisticated with the addition of such features as 'Glidamatic' spring suspension and a detailed interior on the [[Renault Floride]] (222) in October 1959, and the fibre-optic style 'Trans-o-Lite' illuminating lights system first seen on the Superior Ambulance on Cadillac Chassis (437) in October 1962. The early type of interior which was known as 'vac-formed', was  produced by stretching a thin sheet of acetate over a mould by means of a vacuum, and lasted for three years until being replaced by the crisper, more detailed injection-moulded type first seen in the Thames 'Airborne' caravan (420) in February 1962.

The Corgi design team came up with the first model with an opening feature in February 1960, the [[Aston Martin DB4]] (218) which had an opening bonnet. Steerable front wheels, jewelled headlights and rear lights and an opening boot complete with spare wheel were added on the [[Bentley S1 Continental|Bentley Continental]] Sports Saloon (224) in April 1961, and by October 1963 with the release of the [[:commons:File:Ghia L6.4 (Chrysler base) west of Bedford front three quarters.JPG|Ghia L6.4 (241)]] new levels of authenticity were reached. This model featured a number of 'firsts' with not only an opening bonnet, but also opening doors and boot, and a detailed interior with a rear view mirror, folding front seats, and even a model corgi dog sitting on the rear parcel shelf. At introduction, the Ghia sold for eight shillings and sixpence, and even at this relatively high price around 1.7&amp;nbsp;million were sold before being withdrawn in 1969. By contrast, only twenty five examples of the real car were completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.automotivetraveler.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=626&amp;Itemid=336 Chrysler's Italianate Diversions, Part Two: the Ghia L6.4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217000000/http://www.automotivetraveler.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=626&amp;Itemid=336|date=17 February 2011}}; retrieved 18 July 2009 from automotivetraveler.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Mettoy introduced a range of smaller scale vehicles called [[Husky Toys]]. These retailed at a lower retail price than the larger Corgi Toys, and competed with [[Matchbox Toys]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Corgi Classics==
In 1964 Corgi diversified into the adult collector market and released a range of highly detailed models of vintage cars called '[[Corgi Classics]]'. Marketed at a higher price point than Lesney's [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] 'Models of Yesteryear', they met with mixed success. Initial releases were a 1927 [[Bentley]] finished in green (9001) or red (9002), an open 1915 [[Ford Model T]] coloured black (9011) and a version finished in blue with the hood raised (9013), a 1910 [[Daimler Company|Daimler]] 38 finished in red (9021) and a 1911 [[Renault]] 12/16 finished in lavender (9031) or pale yellow (9032). 

Two years later, a 1912 [[Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost]] coloured silver (9041) was added to the range, which was updated in 1970 to feature American TV stars [[The Hardy Boys]], discussed later in this article. A Ford Model T van in Lyons Tea livery (9014) appeared in the 1967 Corgi catalogue but was never released. The Corgi Classics range had been discontinued by 1969, although the name was later revived for a range of adult collectable models in the 1980s.

==Corgi Major Toys==
Following the success of the Dinky Supertoys range of die-cast trucks, Corgi decided to launch a range of heavy commercial vehicles in October 1957 with the release of the Carrimore Car Transporter (1101) featuring a [[Bedford]] S-Type tractor unit with full glazing in keeping with the rest of the Corgi range, and the company's first gift set including the Carrimore Car Transporter and four cars (GS1); [[Austin Cambridge]] (201), [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] 2.4 (208), [[Austin-Healey]] (300) and [[MG MGA|MGA]] (302) in time for the Christmas market in December 1957.

Early models in the new 'Corgi Major' range were issued in sturdy two piece boxes featuring the blue and yellow colour scheme that had recently been adopted across the entire Corgi range, later models in the 1960s using clear fronted packaging in line with the rest of the Corgi Toys range. The Carrimore Low Loader(1100) was the next release in April 1958 which was a low loader trailer attached to the Bedford cab and was followed by the similar Machinery Carrier low loader (1104) in September 1958. In November 1958 the Euclid TC12 Bulldozer (1102) was issued. A large earth mover which was being widely used in the construction of the M1, the UK's first motorway, the Euclid factory was only two miles from Corgi headquarters which allowed easy access to all the data required to produce a very accurate model. April 1959 saw the release of the Bedford Fuel Tanker in the attractive red livery of 'Mobilgas' (1110) and this model was revamped in pale blue and white as the Bedford Milk Tanker (1129) in May 1962, and both were later re-issued with a more modern [[Bedford TK]] cab.

The Midland Red Motor Express Coach (1120), issued in March 1960, was a model of the latest high speed coach for the motorway age fitted with a turbo-charged engine and capable of 100&amp;nbsp;mph, and a model of the pioneering [[SR.N1]] [[hovercraft]] (1119) was released in June 1960. In November 1962 the new Bedford TK cab unit was also fitted to the existing Carrimore Car Transporter (1105) and was also included in a new Car Transporter Gift Set (GS28) in December 1963 along with four cars; [[Ford Consul Classic]] (234), [[Mercedes-Benz]] 220 SE (230), [[Renault Floride]] (222) and [[Fiat 2100]] (232). The [[Ecurie Ecosse]] Racing Transporter (1126) issued in October 1961 was a racing car transporter custom built for the Scottish motor racing team Ecurie Ecosse, with room for three cars and an on-board workshop.

The Corgi model featured operational ramps, a sliding door revealing the workshop complete with a miniature lathe, operational steering, and was finished in authentic dark blue. Racing Transporter Set (GS16) was also released in October 1961 featuring the Ecurie Ecosse transporter along with three racing cars; [[Vanwall]] (150), [[BRM]] (156) and [Lotus XI] (151). 

The Simon Snorkel Aerial Rescue Truck (1127) was issued in September 1964. This model fire engine was based on a Bedford TK chassis and featured an extendable centre-hinged arm with rescue cradle complete with fire fighter figure holding a die-cast water cannon which could be manoeuvred by means of a rotating base and wheels and gears. The model stayed in the range until being updated with a more modern Dennis cab (1126) in June 1977.
[[File:Nick's Pics 059.jpg|thumb|left|1142 Holmes Wrecker Recovery Vehicle]]
A new cab unit was introduced in September 1965. The [[Ford]] H Cab and Detachable Trailer (1137) was an American truck produced by Corgi to appeal to the lucrative US market and featured a forward tilting cab revealing a highly detailed engine, realistic moveable door mirrors and die-cast metal air horns and side ladders. The large box trailer featured sliding side doors, opening rear doors and was finished in the blue and silver 'Express Services' livery. The leap in quality of this model proved that the Major range had entered a new era, and it continued to sell well until 1972. The new Ford cab was used again in April 1966 with a new version of the Carrimore Car Transporter (1138) which had been re-designed to carry up to six Corgi cars, and which also featured in Gift Set 41 along with six cars; [[Ford Cortina]] Estate (440), [[Rover P6|Rover 2000]] (252), [[Hillman Imp]] (251), [[Mini Cooper]] De-Luxe (249), [[Austin 7|Austin Seven]] (225) and Mini Cooper Monte Carlo 1966 (321). This gift set was initially only available by mail order but was finally issued in time for Christmas in December 1967.

The Holmes Wrecker Recovery Vehicle (1142) issued in May 1967 was also based on the Ford H Series tractor unit, and featured twin boom die-cast recovery cranes with hooks attached to cotton lines that could be extended by winding a pair of spare wheels attached to the sides of the vehicle, and also included were two model mechanics previously seen with the 'Express Services' truck. The [[American LaFrance]] Aerial Rescue Truck (1143) was added to the Major range in October 1968 and was a highly detailed model of a tiller/ladder truck (or hook and ladder) from the United States of America. It featured an extendable ladder on a rotating base complete with plastic ladder extensions and model firemen and has recently been re-issued by the modern Corgi company in a number of authentic liveries. 

The Carrimore Car Transporter Mark IV using the recently introduced [[Scammell]] cab was also released in April 1969 and a gift set (GS48) featuring the new transporter and six cars; [[MG MGC|MGC]] GT (345), Mini Cooper Monte Carlo 1967 (339), [[Sunbeam Imp]] Monte Carlo 1967 (340), [[Mini Cooper S]] Magnifique (334), [[Morris Mini Minor]] (226) and [[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'s [[Volvo P1800]] (258) soon followed. By October 1970 the Carrimore Car Transporter Mark V (1146) had grown to three decks and Gift Set 20 again featured the transporter complete with six cars now fitted with Whizzwheels; [[Lancia Fulvia]] Zagato (372), [[Marcos (automobile)|Marcos]] 3 Litre (377), [[MG MGC|MGC]] GT (378), [[Ford Capri]] 3 Litre (311), The Saint's [[Volvo P1800]] (201) and [[Pontiac Firebird]] (343). The colour schemes applied to some cars in the Car Transporter Gift Sets were unique to models included in these sets, such as the MGC GT (345) finished in orange, and today are particularly collectable. The Scammell Handyman Ferrymasters Truck (1147) issued in December 1969, proved to be the last new application for the Scammell cab and was finished in the authentic yellow and white livery of the Ferrymasters haulage company.

The Major range continued into the 1970s but along with the Corgi Toys range suffered somewhat from the constraints on development budgets that the company was forced to make. The [[Mercedes-Benz Unimog]] and snowplough (1150) was released in February 1971 and another American cab unit was introduced in October 1971. The new [[Mack Trucks|Mack]] was coupled with a fuel tanker in the livery of "Esso" (1152) in October 1971 and a Transcontinental trailer (1100) in November 1971, and fitted with an updated version of the Priestman Cub Shovel now converted to become a crane in October 1972 as the Mack Priestman Crane Truck (1154). 

A new [[Berliet]] cab was introduced in May 1974 as the Crane Fruehauf Discharge Dumper (1102), a large articulated aggregate carrier for use on construction sites, and the new cab was also used as the Berliet Wrecker Truck (1144) in March 1975 updating the aforementioned Holmes Wrecker, which had been in the range since 1967. The Pathfinder Airport Crash Truck (1103) released in September 1974 had won the Design Council Engineering Award for its manufacturer Chubb, and the Corgi miniature included an internal water tank allowing water to be squirted through die-cast water cannons by pumping a rubber bulb. Another new cab was introduced in April 1976. The Ford Transcontinental was designed for long range treks across the European continent and was first issued coupled to the fuel tanker previously seen with the earlier Mack cab, also in 'Esso' livery (1157) or "Gulf" livery (1160), and, later in February 1982, in the livery of "Guinness" (1169).

==Circus vehicle models==
The [[Chipperfield's Circus]] Crane Truck (1121) was the first of the highly successful and much sought after range of Chipperfield's Circus vehicles produced by Corgi Toys during the 1960s, and was issued in October 1960. It was based on a large International truck fitted with a metal crane, hook and pulley, and painted in the traditional Chipperfield's Circus livery of red and blue, as were all the models in the range. It was followed by the Circus Animal Cage Trailer (1123) in January 1961 which featured two two-part opening doors revealing a large cage with metal bars. 

These two models were later packaged together as the Chipperfield's Circus Set (GS12). An updated version of the Karrier Bantam Mobile Butcher Shop was introduced in January 1962 as the Circus Booking Office (426). The window insert of the original depicting joints of meat was replaced with a new one with circus advertising posters. In April 1962 the existing Land Rover 109 model was issued along with a trailer carrying a large cage and a model elephant as Chipperfield's Circus Land Rover and Elephant Cage on Trailer (GS19).

The Chipperfield's Circus Vehicles Set (GS23) was issued in September 1962 featuring all the Chipperfield's models released to date, and today this is one of the most desirable gift sets issued by the company. The Chipperfield's Circus Horse Transporter (1130) was released in October 1962 featuring the new [[Bedford TK]] tractor unit and an articulated trailer with models of circus horses, and in June 1964 the Bedford TK tractor unit was adapted with a large high-sided open top 'wooden' box as the Giraffe Transporter (503) complete with models of a mother and baby giraffe.

The [[Land Rover]], which had been adapted as a 'Vote For Corgi' campaigning vehicle as a tie-in with the 1964 UK General Election, was re-issued in September 1965 in the red and blue colours of Chipperfield's as the Chipperfield's Circus Parade Vehicle (487) with a clown and chimpanzee replacing the political canvassers of the original, and a 'The Circus is Here' banner across the bonnet. The Chipperfield's Circus Menagerie Transporter (1139) which was released in October 1968 featured a new [[Scammell]] Handyman cab and a flatbed articulated trailer which carried a load of three clear plastic boxes designed to represent cages, each containing models of lions, bears and tigers. 

The Chipperfield's Circus Crane and Cage (1144), issued in April 1969, again featured the Scammell tractor unit but modified using the Holmes Wrecker platform with a large crane mounted on a pivoting base to the rear, and included another of the clear plastic animal cages with a model rhinoceros inside. The final model in the Chipperfield's Circus range was released in January 1970. The Chipperfield's Performing Poodles Pick Up (511) was an update of the earlier Kennel Club Wagon (itself an adaptation of the [[Chevrolet Impala]] first issued in 1960) and included model poodles and trainer.

There were no further circus related releases until the Jean Richard Circus Set (GS48) which was issued in November 1978. This large set included models of the new 1/36 scale Land Rover Estate and [[Chevrolet]] Van which had been updated to become a parade vehicle and mobile booking office respectively. Also included were an animal cage trailer and models of horses and an elephant and figures of a clown and a ringmaster, together with various Big Top accessories. 

The most interesting model, however, was the Berliet tractor unit which had been adapted to become a human cannonball launcher complete with die-cast cannon attached to the rear and a human cannonball figure that could be fired from the cannon by means of depressing a button.

==Competition models==
[[File:Nick's Pics 033.jpg|thumb|left|200px|151A [[Lotus Eleven|Lotus XI]]]]
Throughout the company's history, Corgi Toys have been closely associated with modelling Grand Prix and Formula 1 racing cars. The first issued was the [[Vanwall]] Grand Prix car (150) issued in July 1957. Finished in green and carrying racing number 3, it was a scale model of the actual car driven by [[Stirling Moss]]. This was followed in December 1958 by a [[BRM]] Grand Prix car (106) also with green paintwork, and both cars featured in the Racing Car Set (GS5) from 1958, along with the [[Lotus Eleven|Lotus XI Le Mans racing car]] (151) from July 1958. The Vanwall, however, had been re-coloured red.

It was followed in December 1964 by the Lotus-Climax F1 car (155). Finished in an authentic [[British Racing Green]] and carrying racing number 1, it represented [[Jim Clark]]'s 1963 world championship winning Lotus 25, and in 1967 it was joined by the Cooper-Maserati F1 car (156) painted blue. The Lotus-Climax and the Cooper-Maserati were re-engineered in 1969 to include steerable front wheels operated by moving the driver from side to side, and a high level rear wing in the style of real Formula 1 cars of the time. They were re-coloured orange in the case of the Lotus-Climax (158) and yellow in the case of the Cooper-Maserati (159). A [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] Racing Car set (GS37) was issued in August 1966 containing the Lotus-Climax F1 car, two [[Lotus Elan]]s and a [[Volkswagen]] breakdown tow truck. Another Ferrari was issued in February 1965, the Ferrari Berlinetta (314) ([[Ferrari 250 LM]]) which had competed at the 1964 Le Mans 24 Hour race, and in May 1967 another successful sports racer, the Porsche Carrera 6 (330) ([[Porsche 906]]), was released.

In 1972 Corgi worked with the newly formed Grand Prix Association to produce a series of 1/36 scale Formula 1 racing cars. The first was the Yardley [[McLaren]] M19A (151) driven by New Zealander and 1967 World Champion [[Denny Hulme]] which was followed by the Brooke Bond Oxo Surtees TS9 driven by 1964 World Champion [[John Surtees]] (150), later followed by a Surtees TS9B in the livery of Italian sponsors 'Pagnossin', driven by [[Andrea de Adamich]] (153). 

These were the first models produced in the larger 1/36 scale instead of the familiar O scale preferred by Dinky and Corgi up to this date (varying between 1/43 to about 1/50 for larger vehicles). Within the following five years virtually the complete Corgi range would be replaced by vehicles in 1/36 scale, much to the dismay of adult collectors. 

1973 saw the release of [[Jacky Ickx]]'s Ferrari 312 B2 (152) and the John Player Special [[Lotus 72]] (154) of World Champion (1972 and 1974) [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] or [[Ronnie Peterson]], and in 1974 the [[Shadow Racing Cars|Shadow]] F1 car was issued in both UOP livery (155) as driven by Jackie Oliver, and as [[Graham Hill]]'s Embassy Shadow (156). Scottish multiple World Champion [[Jackie Stewart]]'s Elf [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]] F1 car (158) was also released along with the STP Patrick Eagle (159) driven to victory in the 1973 [[Indianapolis 500]] by Gordon Johncock.

The final two models in the series were the [[Hesketh 308]] F1 car (190) driven by the then becoming English World Champion [[James Hunt]] issued in 1976, and the six wheeled Tyrrell Project 34 driven by Frenchman Patrick Depailler issued in Elf livery (161) in 1977 and First National City Travellers Checks livery (162) which was released in 1978. Two Formula 1 cars were also issued in 1/18 scale, the John Player Special Lotus 72 (190) in 1974 and the Marlboro McLaren (191) in 1975.

The Proteus-Campbell [[Bluebird-Proteus CN7|Bluebird]] Record Car (153) was issued in September 1960 and was modelled on the vehicle with which [[Donald Campbell]] was to set a new Land Speed Record on 17 July 1964. The Corgi design team were given extensive access to the real car in order to produce their scale model, even receiving paint samples to enable them to create an exact colour match. However, a lighter blue was chosen for the model eventually. An example of the model was presented to Donald Campbell by young members of the Corgi Club.
[[File:Nick's Pics 052.jpg|thumb|left|475 [[Citroen DS Safari]] 1964 Winter Olympics &amp; 499 Citroen DS Safari 1968 Grenoble Olympics]]
Models following themes were released over the years. In January 1964, Corgi updated the existing [[Citroën DS]] Safari to become a promotional vehicle for the 1964 Winter Olympics (475), complete with a skier figure, four model skis and two model ski poles. Painted white and with a decal of the Olympic rings logo on the bonnet, this model then reverted to a 'Corgi Ski Club' version the following year. 

It was revamped again in November 1967 for the 1968 Winter Olympics (499), this time painted white with a blue roof, and with a model toboggan on the roof rack along with a figure of a tobogganist and a pair of skis and poles, and a stylish 'Grenoble Olympiade 1968' decal on the bonnet. The final version introduced in 1970 was an Alpine Rescue vehicle (510), painted white with a red roof and which came complete with figures of a St Bernard dog and rescuer, and today is the rarest of the versions.
[[File:Nick's Pics 037.jpg|thumb|right|340 [[Sunbeam Imp]] 1967 Monte Carlo Rally, 322 Rover 2000 1965 Monte Carlo Rally, 339 Mini Cooper S 1967 Monte Carlo Rally]]
The [[Monte Carlo Rally]], held annually in January, provided a rich source of model cars between 1964 and 1967. By following the event closely, Corgi Toys were able to issue a model of the winning car shortly after the end of the rally Often there was not even enough time to produce a unique box for the new model, which had to make do with a hastily produced sticker applied to a standard issue box for a similar model. 

The 1964 winner, [[Paddy Hopkirk]]'s [[Mini]] Cooper S (317) released in February 1964, featured jewelled headlights and a rally lamp on the roof, and was finished in the BMC team colours of red with a white roof with authentic [[Monte Carlo Rally]] transfers. Three Monte Carlo Rally cars were issued in 1965, the winning Mini Cooper S of [[Timo Mäkinen]] (321) in February, finished in the same red with a white roof, and three jewelled rally lamps, and in April a [[Rover P6|Rover 2000]] (322) in maroon with a white roof with two jewelled rally lamps in the grill and a [[Citroën DS21]] (323) with four small jewelled rally lamps and finished in pale blue with a white roof complete with roof aerial.

All three of these models were available in the Monte Carlo Gift Set (GS38) also issued in April 1965; a highly prized set for today's collector. Another Mini Cooper S in Monte Carlo Rally finish was issued the January of following year complete with two jewelled rally lamps in the grille and the signatures of the driver Timo Mäkinen and his co-driver Paul Easter printed on the roof. The model number 321 was carried over from the 1965 car. A [[Hillman Imp]] was also issued as a Monte Carlo Rally car (328), finished in blue with a white flash along the sides and two jewelled rally lamps, and was driven by an all-female team of [[Rosemary Smith]] and Valerie Domleo in the 1966 event.

1967 was the final year that Corgi issued Monte Carlo Rally cars, and the famous Mini Cooper S (339) appeared yet again in March, this time with four jewelled rally lamps in the grill, a sump guard and two spare wheels on a roof rack borrowed from the 'Surfing' Mini Traveller (485) from 1965. The 1967 Monte Carlo Rally Mini Cooper S stayed in the Corgi range until 1972, spanning two different castings.  Another Mini Cooper S (333) was released in February 1967 carrying the same red and white paintwork, but as campaigned in the 1967 RAC/Sun rally by Tony Fall and Mike Wood, along with another Rover 2000 (322) from the same event finished in white with a matt black bonnet. The final rally car was the Sunbeam Imp (340) issued in March 1967, which featured four jewelled rally lamps and was finished in blue with a white flash and front panel. In December 1965 a Volkswagen 1200 Beetle was issued in East African Safari finish (256). This model featured an opening boot and engine cover and steerable front wheels operated by a spare tyre on the roof of the car.

Three years later, in July 1969, Corgi issued the winning Hillman Hunter from the [[1968 London to Sydney Marathon]] (302), complete with Take-Off Wheels, roof mounted tool box and a plastic kangaroo guard across the front of the car. This time the packaging included a model kangaroo and details of the event, and in February 1970 a model of the unique 4wd [[Ford Capri]] 3-Litre rally car (303) driven by [[Roger Clark]] was released. A model of the successful [[Datsun 240Z]] rally car in East African Safari Finish (394) was issued in October 1972 and in May 1973 the Datsun 240Z was also issued in "US Rally" finish (396). This, in fact, was an authentic model of John Morton's 300&amp;nbsp;bhp BRE-Datsun 240Z which won the 1970 and 1971 SCCA class C/P championships. The [[Ferrari Daytona|Ferrari 365GTB/4 Daytona]] as raced at the 1973 [[Le Mans 24 Hours]] race, with JCB and Corgi sponsorship (324), was released in June 1973 along with another in white/red/blue livery inspired by a 1972 Le Mans entry (323). In July 1973 the [[Porsche]]-[[Audi]] 917/10 (397) from the [[Can-Am]] race series was issued with L&amp;M cigarette sponsorship.

In the early 1970s Corgi Toys issued a range of dragsters in response not only to the increased interest in this form of motorsport in the UK, focused on the [[Santa Pod]] Raceway in Northamptonshire, but also the attention brought to these vehicles by [[Mattel]]'s [[Hot Wheels]]. The first to be released was the 'Quartermaster' Dragster (162) in April 1971, closely followed by the 'Commuter' Dragster (161) in June. Both were models of real vehicles, and were of the 'rail' dragster variety. 

The first 'Funny Car' dragster was the Santa Pod "Gloworm" Dragster (163) issued in July 1971, and which was based on the existing Ford Capri 3-Litre casting. Modifications allowed the body to be hinged from the rear, and by pressing a button secreted in the front bumper the entire body rose, by means of a spring, to reveal a roll cage and driver within and a detailed V8 engine. The next release was a figment of the Corgi design team's imagination. The "Organ Grinder" Mustang Funny Car (166), which was issued in October 1971, was purely an update of the Ford Mustang (320) first seen in 1965, complete with huge rear wheels and headers resembling organ pipes fitted to the V8 engine. In December 1971 the Ison Brothers "Wild Honey" Dragster (164) was released which was a fully customised 'gasser' based on a 1930s Austin Seven saloon. The Adams Brothers "Drag-Star" (165) released in February 1972 was a four engined machine produced in conjunction with designers the Adams Brothers, and the earlier "Quartermaster" Dragster was updated in October 1972 as the John Woolfe Radio Luxembourg 208 Dragster (170).

==Film and television models==
===1960s===
Corgi Toys introduced the first of the many film and television tie-in models that made the company famous in March 1965, with [[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'s [[Volvo P1800]] (258) from the British television series ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'' starring [[Roger Moore]]. This was an update of the existing Volvo P1800 model that had been issued in 1962, now finished in white and featuring The Saint's logo on the bonnet and a model of The Saint in the drivers seat. However, with the second in the range of film and TV related models Corgi unwittingly revolutionised the British toy car industry.

[[File:1964 Corgi Aston Martin DB5.jpg|thumb|270 James Bond Aston Martin DB5, second issue from 1968 produced by Corgi Toys as a tie-in to the film "Goldfinger"]]
The most famous and best selling (to date) toy car of all, [[James Bond]]'s [[Aston Martin DB5]] (261) from the film ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', was issued in October 1965. Despite the fact that the casting of the new James Bond car was based heavily on the earlier [[Aston Martin DB4]] model from 1960, it was the special features marked out this model. There were machine guns in the front wings which popped out at the touch of a button, a bulletproof shield which popped up to protect the rear screen when the exhaust pipes were pressed, and an ejector seat which fired through a roof panel which opened by the touch of another button.  The model was released in time for the 1965 Christmas market and the Corgi factory found it was unable to keep up with demand, leading to coverage in the British press of stories of toy shop shelves being cleared of this new must-have toy in minutes. The model remains in production to this day in an updated form and has gone on to sell more than seven million examples in all its various versions.

The "Thrushbuster" (497) was an update of an existing [[Oldsmobile Super 88]] casting dating back to 1961, but now with models of the stars of the television series [[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]], agents  '[[Napoleon Solo]]' and '[[Illya Kuryakin]]', firing guns out of the windows. The two figures popped in and out of the car windows by pressing down on a model periscope protruding through the roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corgitoys.free.fr/English/CORGI_497_MAN_FROM_UNCLE.htm |title=CORGI 497 MAN FROM UNCLE THRUSHBUSTER 1966-1969 |accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Corgi 1960's Batmobile.jpg|thumb|left|267 Later issue of the Batmobile featuring Whizzwheels]]
The Christmas market was again dominated by a Corgi toy car; this time the [[Batmobile]] (267) released in October 1966. This was a [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] customised 1955 [[Lincoln Futura]] concept car bought by Barris as a wreck from Ford Motor Company (reputedly for one dollar) and which featured heavily in the American television series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]''. 

In June 1967 GS3 was issued consisting of 'The Batmobile' towing a '[[Batboat]]' on a trailer, and another James Bond car soon followed – the [[Toyota 2000GT]] (336) issued in October 1967 from the film ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'', which fired rockets from the boot. 

The previously issued 1927 Bentley was updated for a second time to tie in with the BBC television series ''The World of Wooster'' (9004) which starred [[Ian Carmichael]] and featured figures of 'Bertie Wooster' and his valet 'Jeeves' at the wheel. It was the only film and television related model issued as part of the Corgi Classics range. The final film and television related model for 1967 was issued in November. The crime fighting car '[[Black Beauty]]' (268) - a George Barris customised [[Imperial (automobile)|1965 Imperial Crown sedan]], included an operational satellite launcher inside the boot and a rocket fired from behind the grill, and was featured in the American television series ''[[The Green Hornet]]''. Although the series was not screened in the UK until years later, the model proved to be very popular and it went on to sell over two million examples.

A new casting of the James Bond Aston Martin DB5 (270) was released in February 1968, this time featuring the correct DB5 taillights (instead of the DB4 taillight clusters on the 261) and authentic silver paintwork. The original had been painted gold after the Corgi design team decided that silver painted pre-production models looked as if the metal bodies were unpainted. The new model now featured tyre slashers and revolving number plates whilst retaining all the features of the original, and early examples  packaged in a short lived bubble-pack are even more valuable today than the earlier 1965 release. 

November 1968 saw the release of the flying car '[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]' (266) from the successful film of the same name that had been in cinemas throughout that summer, and which featured plastic wings that popped out from the car's side skirts when the hand brake was pushed and detailed miniatures of the car's inventor 'Caracticus Potts', 'Truly Scrumptious' and the children 'Jeremy' and 'Jemima'.  The 'Monkeemobile' (277) issued in December was a model of the [[Dean Jeffries]] customised 1966 Pontiac GTO that featured in the American television series ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]''. It included miniatures of band members Davy Jones, Mickey Dolenz, Peter Tork and Mike Nesmith sitting in the car.
[[File:Nick's Pics 053.jpg|thumb|left|200px|277 Monkeemobile]]
Film and television related models continued to be issued in February 1969 with the '[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]' (803) from the animated [[Beatles]] film of the same name. This model featured two hatches that lifted at the touch of buttons on the side of the craft to allow models of the Fab Four [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]] to pop into view. Early examples featured a white hatch to the front and a yellow hatch to the rear in keeping with the colour scheme of the original, before both hatches were coloured red on later models. The 'Yellow Submarine' commands  high prices today amongst both die-cast collectors and Beatles related collectors too.

Corgi Toys not only produced models of automotive stars of film and television, but also models of production vehicles. A newly tooled Commer 2500 mini bus body was used for the Samuelson Mobile Camera Van (479) issued in December 1967 which included a detailed cast metal model of a Panavision film camera and plastic cameraman on a metal plinth that could be either attached to the vehicle's roofrack or to the front or rear of the van for tracking shots. The lens of the camera was represented by a tiny jewel. In September 1968 the Renault 16 Tour De France Paramount Film Unit (GS13) was released. This gift set featured a Renault 16 car with the tailgate removed and a platform extension fixed at the rear to accommodate the Panavision film camera model and cameraman. Also included was a miniature racing cycle and cyclist.

===1970s===
The releases of film and television related models continued into the seventies, and included more [[James Bond]] models. In June 1970, the 1912 [[Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost]] from the Corgi Classics range was reissued, but updated with psychedelic paintwork and featuring figures of the group from the animated series ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'', another American television show which was unknown in Britain. This time the model failed to sell, making it extremely rare today. A [[Ford Mustang Mach 1]] (391) and the "[[Moon buggy|Moon Buggy]]" (802) from the film ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' were issued in 1972, and the [[Lotus Esprit]] (269) in 'underwater' mode from ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' in 1977.

A rocket-firing 'Stromberg' [[Bell JetRanger]] helicopter (926) from the same film was added in 1978. The [[Space Shuttle]] (649) from the Bond movie ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' appeared in 1979 along with a 'Drax' JetRanger helicopter (930) from the same film. A [[Citroën 2CV]] which James Bond drove in the film ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' was issued in 1981.

As the decade progressed some of the film and television related models became less authentic due to the lack of expensive licensing deals, and more a product of the imagination of the Corgi design team. In 1973 '[[Dick Dastardly]]'s' Car (809) was issued featuring models of the characters 'Dick Dastardly' and his sidekick '[[Muttley]]' from the  children's television program ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]''. However, this Corgi offering was a toy-like race car from the 'Qualitoys' range, and was a far cry from the famous "00-zero" car that 'Dick Dastardly' drove in the cartoon series. 

In 1978 the "U.S. Racing Buggy" (167) was reissued as 'The Penguinmobile', themed around [[Batman]]'s arch-enemy [[The Penguin]], complete with an umbrella. (259). A 'Batbike' was released in 1978 featuring a figure of 'Batman' sitting astride a modified motorbike which fired two rockets, along with a series of vehicles that were issued as the result of obtaining the [[Marvel Comics]] license. They were themed around [[Spider-Man]], [[Captain America]], [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[The Incredible Hulk]]. 

These included a 'Spidervan' (436); a suitably decorated Chevrolet van, which had also been issued the previous year as a tie-in with the American television series ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (434), a "''[[Daily Planet]]''" JetRanger helicopter (929), a "Spiderbuggy" (261); a Jeep CJ-5 with a model of 'Spider-Man's' archenemy "[[The Green Goblin]]" trapped in a web styled plastic bag dangling from a crane fitted at the back of the vehicle, a "Spidercopter" (928) and a "Spiderbike" (266). A similar treatment was also given to other Marvel characters including a "[[Captain America]]" Jetmobile (263), a 'Captain Marvel' Porsche 917/10 Can-Am racer (262) and an 'Incredible Hulk' Mazda pick-up (264) which featured a caged model of the 'Hulk' on the flatbed of the truck.

A "[[Superman]]" gift set (GS21) was released featuring a 'Supermobile', the 'Daily Planet' helicopter and a [[Buick Regal]] police car, as well as a "Spider-Man" gift set (GS23) consisting of the "Spiderbuggy", the "Spidercopter" and the "Spidervan". Many of these later film and television related releases were not models of authentic vehicles as were the earlier issues from the 1960s, but merely existing models updated to take advantage of recently acquired licensing deals.

In May 1978 a new version of the [[James Bond]] [[Aston Martin DB5]] (271) was issued in 1/36 scale which featured the operational gimmicks of the 1965 original. This model appears in the Corgi range to the present day. In October 1978 [[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'s [[Jaguar XJS]] (320) was issued. This was a model of the latest Jaguar coupe as driven by [[Ian Ogilvy]] in the ATV television series ''The [[Return of the Saint]]'' and, again, was painted white and featured The Saint logo on the bonnet. 

In 1980, the '[[Buck Rogers]]' Starfighter (647), from the series ''[[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|Buck Rogers in the 25th Century]]'', was released, including figures of 'Colonel Wilma Deering' and robot 'Twiki'. A series of models featuring characters from [[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' were also issued in 1980. These included "[[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]]'s" car (2030), "[[Fozzie Bear]]'s truck" (2031), "[[Miss Piggy]]'s Sports Coupe" (2032) and "[[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]]'s Percussionmobile" (2033).

By the mid-1970s some of the most popular series shown on British television were American police dramas, and Corgi decided to model several of the vehicles featured in these shows. In 1976 the Buick Regal (296) from the series ''[[Kojak]]'' was issued, complete with figures of 'Lieutenant Kojak' and 'Detective Crocker' shooting from the rear seat, and a year later the [[Ford Gran Torino]] from ''[[Starsky &amp; Hutch]]'' (292) was released also with figures of "David Starsky", "Ken Hutchinson", and a "suspect". 

In 1980, a silver [[Ford Capri]] 3.0 S (342) was issued as a tie-in with the popular British television crime drama ''[[The Professionals (TV series)|The Professionals]]'' featuring models of 'Bodie', 'Doyle' and 'Cowley', as well as a 1957 [[Ford Thunderbird]] (348) from the American show ''[[Vega$]]'' with 'Dan Tanna' at the wheel. 1982 saw the release of the ''[[Magnum P.I.|Magnum, P.I.]]'' [[Ferrari 308 GTB/GTS|Ferrari 308 GTS]] (298). Cost-cutting at the time dictated that no figure was included.

== Emergency vehicle models ==
The first emergency vehicles produced by Corgi Toys were issued as part of the launch range in July 1956, and were based on the Bedford Utilicon light commercial. It was issued in red as a 'Fire Dept' vehicle (405M) and in green as an 'Army Fire Service' vehicle (405), both with a tin plate ladder attached to the roof of the vehicle. These were followed in June 1958 by the company's first police vehicle; a [[Riley Pathfinder]] patrol car (209), finished in black and with a die cast police sign fitted to the roof complete with siren and bell. In January 1959 a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] 2.4 Fire Chief car (213) was added to the range, finished in red and with a nylon aerial, crest transfers on the front doors and the same cast sign as the Pathfinder but modified to read 'Fire Chief'. The first American emergency vehicle to be produced by Corgi Toys was the [[Chevrolet Impala]] State Patrol car (223) introduced in December 1959. It was painted black and featured a nylon aerial and 'State Patrol' stickers on the vehicle's front doors. An updated version finished in black and white was issued in 1965.

By 1959 the M1, the UK's first motorway, had opened to the public and this prompted the introduction of a new breed of powerful police vehicle able to carry a large payload. The [[Ford Zodiac]] Motorway Patrol Car (419) was introduced in August 1960 and was finished in white with a plastic aerial fitted to the front wing, a blue light attached to the roof, a 'Police' decal on the bonnet and a vac-formed interior detailing rescue equipment in the luggage compartment and in June 1962 the [[Oldsmobile Super 88]] County Sheriff car (237) was added to the range. Painted black and white it featured a red light fitted to the roof and 'County Sheriff' stickers on the doors. This model became the company's first million seller. The Superior Ambulance on [[Cadillac]] Chassis (437) introduced in October 1962 was from the latest generation of models and featured red and white paintwork, a working battery operated flashing light on the roof and four trans-o-lite fibre optic lights in each corner of the roof that flashed in unison with the main bulb. This model was re-issued in blue and white in 1966. In January 1963 the existing Chevrolet Impala was introduced as a Fire Chief car (439), painted red with a light on the roof, crests decals on the doors and a 'Fire Chief' transfer on the bonnet, and was also updated with a red and white finish in 1966. In June 1963 the [[Commer]] Police Van (464) was released, painted blue with a battery operated flashing light on the roof, barred side windows and 'County Police' transfers along the sides, and this model was also updated in 1967. An ambulance version (463) painted white was issued in February 1964.

In October 1964 a Police Dog Handler [[Mini]] van (450) was introduced painted dark blue with 'Police' in white letters on the sides, a nylon aerial fitted to the front wing and came with models of the police dog handler and police Alsatian dog. The [[Volkswagen]] European Police Car (492) issued in May 1966 was finished in the green and white of the German police force, and carried 'Polizei' transfers on the doors. It featured steerable front wheels operated by the blue metal 'light' on the roof and two policemen sitting inside the vehicle, not to mention opening boot and rear engine cover. Another rear engined police car was introduced in May 1968, the [[Sunbeam Imp]] 'Panda' car (506). It was painted black and white initially but this colour scheme was soon changed to authentic 'Panda' car colours of pale blue with a white vertical centre section.
[[File:Nick's Pics 040.jpg|thumb|left|437 Superior Ambulance on Cadillac Chassis (second issue)]]
In June 1970 a [[Porsche 911]] Targa 'Polizei' car (509) fitted with Whizzwheels was released. It was based on a real Swiss police vehicle with its colour scheme of white and red and was fitted with a blue light on an extension next to the door and a die-cast loud hailer on the engine cover. The Fire Bug (395) appeared in December 1971, and was based on a GP Beach Buggy fitted with fire fighting equipment. British police vehicles were well represented with the Police 'Vigilant' [[Range Rover]] (461) released in January 1972 and the [[Ford Cortina]] Police Car (402) released in August of the same year. 

Both models were finished in the contemporary white with red/blue side stripes, which would have been familiar to many motorists at the time. The Range Rover came complete with a model policeman and emergency road signs, while the Cortina was also released with 'Polizei' labels on the otherwise unchanged British car as an export model for the German-speaking countries.

The remaining years that the company was in existence saw police cars based on such subjects as a Porsche 924 (430) and a Renault 5 (428), both in the white and black livery of the French [[Police nationale]], a [[Mercedes-Benz W114|Mercedes 240D]] (412) and the Porsche 924 (430) in white and green of the German 'Polizei', and a blue [[Buick Regal]] (416) which had previously seen service as '[[Kojak]]'s' car. There was also a Metropolitan Police [[Land Rover]] and Horse box (GS44) complete with a model Police horse and rider, which was also available in [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] finish (GS45). 1982 the Ford Escort was released as a blue and white Police 'Panda' car (297). Ambulances were issued based on the Range Rover 'Vigilant' (482), a [[Mercedes-Benz W123]] 'Bonna' (406) in four different liveries for Scandinavian and German-speaking countries, and a Chevrolet Superior Ambulance (405).

There appears, however, to have been a lack of fire fighting machinery released in this time, although the [[American LaFrance]] ladder truck and Simon Snorkel were still available along with the modern Chubb Pathfinder airport crash tender. Two models from this era do warrant attention. Riot Police Truck (422) released in September 1977 was a squat armoured military vehicle painted white and red with twin water cannons fitted to the rear, and perhaps reflected the turbulent times in Britain towards the end of the 1970s, and the Jaguar XJ12 Coupe which was released in December 1975 finished in the white and pale blue livery of the Coastguard (414), complete with die-cast light and twin foghorns on the roof. The model was updated as a police vehicle (429) in February 1978. In 1980 the first of the later 'Corgitronics' range was introduced: the HCB-Angus Firestreak (1001) with battery-operated siren and flashing red lights, complete with two figures in silver protective clothing.

==Commercial vehicles models==
The first light commercial modelled by Corgi Toys was the [[Bedford CA]] van in ''[[Daily Express]]'' livery (403) and in 'KLG Plugs' livery (403M) which was part of the July 1956 range that launched the brand. The CA van was later released in the yellow and black livery of AA Services in May 1957 (408), in the black and silver livery of the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' (421) in June 1960 and in the yellow and blue livery of Corgi Toys (422) in October 1960. The first large commercial vehicles in the Corgi Toys range were the [[Commer]] Dropside lorry (452) and the Commer Refrigerated van finished the livery of Walls Ice Cream (453). The same large van body was used on the [[ERF (lorry manufacturer)|ERF]] 88G chassis to become the Moorhouses Van (459) in March 1958. Painted red and yellow it featured paper stickers on the sides advertising Moorhouses Lemon Cheese and Raspberry jam.[[File:Corgi 452.jpg|thumb|452 Commer Dropside Lorry (1956-1963).]]

The Karrier Bantam Lucozade Van (411) was introduced in August 1958 and featured a sliding plastic door, yellow paintwork  and adverts for [[Lucozade]] energy drink on the side. This model was updated in May 1962 to become the Dairy Produce Van (435) now painted pale blue and white and with a 'Drive Safely on Milk' advert on the side. A [[Volkswagen]] van (433) was introduced in December 1962 finished in two tone red and white along with the [[Volkswagen Kombi]] (434) which was finished in green and white paintwork. A rare promotional version of the van was produced for the Dutch department store Vroom &amp; Dreesman. In February 1963 the basic Volkswagen van was updated with Trans-o-lite headlamps as the Volkswagen Toblerone van (441). It was painted pale blue and finished with transfers along the sides advertising Toblerone chocolate bars. In March 1964 a Volkswagen Pick Up (432) was introduced to the range which came complete with a plastic canopy, and in December 1966 the pick up was converted to become the Volkswagen Breakdown Truck (490).

In 1963 Corgi introduced the Commer Constructor Set (GS 24), which consisted of two Commer FC van chassis units and four different rear bodies – an ambulance, milk float, panel van and pick-up. It proved very popular and remained in production until 1968. These models were also available separately as part of the normal Corgi range. The Commer Holiday Camp Special bus (508) issued in August 1968 was based on the earlier Samuelson Commer Film Unit bus, and featured bright orange and white paintwork with a decal fixed on one side on the vehicle, together with a plastic representation of luggage under cover on the roof rack.

The 'Mister Softee' Ice Cream Van (428) was introduced in March 1962 and was based on a Commer BF 1 ton van and which featured a plastic knob on the underside that allowed the ice cream salesman inside to be rotated. It also featured a sliding side window. In 1965 a Thames [[Wall's ice cream|Wall's]] Ice Cream Van (447) was introduced. This was a smaller vehicle based on the Thames 5 cwt van, a commercial version of the [[Ford Anglia]], and the bodywork featured a pointed roof design and a sliding side window. The model also came with a sheet of stickers which could be applied and also included were models of an ice cream vendor and small boy. An alternative version (474) with musical chimes operated by a handle protruding from the back of the model was introduced a year later, but without the plastic figures. A Karrier Bantam-based Mobile Butchers Shop (413) was released in October 1960 and was later updated to become a [[Chipperfield's Circus]] Booking Office (426) in January 1962 and with the addition of an opening side hatch, a detailed kitchen interior and revolving chef it was re-issued in March 1965 as Joe's Diner Mobile Canteen (471). An export version to be sold in Belgium featured 'Patates Frites' stickers on the side in place of the usual 'Joe's Diner'.

There were no further additions to the commercial vehicle range until June 1979 with the Chevrolet van, first seen the previous year, issued in the livery of Coca-Cola (437). A Ford Transit Wrecker (1140) in the livery of 'Corgi 24 Hour Service' was issued in March 1981 followed by the [[Ford Transit]] [[Milk float]] (405) in February 1982 which carried the period slogan "Milk's Gotta Lotta Bottle".

==Agricultural vehicle models==
A variety of farming vehicles formed part of the Corgi Toys range for the majority of the company's existence under Mettoy's ownership. These models were popular with children from rural areas and today are considered highly collectable. The range was introduced in June 1959 with the [[Massey Ferguson]] 65 tractor (50) finished in the manufacturer's familiar red and white colours. An accompanying Massey Ferguson trailer (51) was introduced at the same time, and in April 1960 an operational shovel was added to the tractor as the Massey Ferguson 65 Tractor Shovel (53). The scoop could either be raised or lowered by means of one of two levers and could be tipped by means of the second lever. Both the tractor and trailer were available together as GS 7. The Massey Ferguson [[combine harvester]] (1111) was released in August 1959 as part of the Corgi Major range, which featured blades that rotated as the model was pushed along.
[[File:Corgi 64.jpg|thumb|64 Working Conveyor on Forward Control Jeep FC-150, complete with farmhand figure and 7 sacks (1965-1969).]]

A new tractor was introduced in May 1961. The [[Fordson]] Power Major Tractor (56) featured steering operated by the steering wheel and was finished in Ford's traditional blue. A plough that could be attached to the tractor (57) was issued at the same time, and the two were available together as GS18. A half track version of the Fordson was available in March 1962 as the Fordson Power Major with Roadless Half Tracks (54). The first Agricultural Gift Set (GS22) was released in September 1962 and included the combine harvester, the Fordson and Massey Ferguson tractors with a fork replacing the shovel on the Massey Ferguson for this gift set only. Also included in the set were two trailers and an example of the existing Land Rover. The Fordson Power Major Tractor was issued with a new Beast Carrier Trailer, carrying a load of four plastic calves, as GS33 in March 1965 and the Working Conveyor on F.C.Jeep (64) was released in June 1965. This was an update of the Forward Control Jeep first issued in 1959 with a new casting of a working conveyor belt assembly fitted to the flat bed and accompanied by plastic model grain sacks and farmer. The first new tractor for five years was issued in July 1966. 

The Massey Ferguson 165 (66) featured steering and an 'engine sound' as the model was pushed along and was finished in red and white. The conveyor belt first seen with the F.C. Jeep was updated with a trailer chassis and coupled to a second new tractor in GS47 issued in September 1966. The [[Ford]] 5000 Super Major was finished in blue and came complete with operational steering and jewelled headlights. The new Ford tractor was coupled to a Beast Carrier trailer for GS1 released in December 1966 which became the first Corgi release in the new style cellophane window box which defined the company's packaging for the future.

The [[Dodge]] Kew Fargo Livestock Transporter (484) was issued in April 1967. This was a large animal transporter based on an American Dodge truck which featured an opening bonnet and carried a cargo of plastic pigs. The Tandem Disc Harrow Plough Trailer (71) was relreased in July 1967 and an updated Agricultural Gift Set (GS5) in October 1967, which featured some of the more recent releases such as the Dodge Kew Fargo and the Massey Ferguson 165 tractor with scoop. In March 1970 the Massey Ferguson 165 Tractor With Saw Attachment (73) was issued featuring a clever circular saw attachment which rotated as the model was pushed along by means of a long finely coiled spring. Next followed two versions of the Ford 5000 Super Major tractor with a fully operational side trenching scoop (74) in 1970 followed by a version with a rear trenching scoop (72) in January 1971. The next new tractor model was issued in April 1973. The Massey Ferguson MF50B (50) featured a closed cab and was finished in yellow. A version with an operational shovel (54) was released in April 1974 and was featured with a trailer carrying a load of plastic 'hay' with figures sitting atop the 'hay' as the latest version of the Agricultural Gift Set (GS4) in July 1974. Another new tractor was added to the range in September 1976. The David Brown Tractor and Trailer Set (GS34) included the new tractor finished in white and with a closed cab and a tipping trailer. These models were also featured in another version of the Agricultural Gift Set (GS42) released in March 1978, along with models of a grain elevator and grain silo. At the same time the [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|David Brown]] tractor was issued with a Danish JF combine harvester attachment (1112).

== Military vehicle models ==
Corgi Toys produced a sizeable range of military vehicles during the 1950s and early 1960s, and they proved very popular. The [[English Electric Thunderbird|Thunderbird Guided Missile]] and Trailer (350) was issued in May 1958 followed by the [[Bristol Bloodhound|Bloodhound Guided Missile]] and Launch Pad (1108) in October 1958. In June 1959 the [[MGM-5 Corporal|Corporal]] Guided Missile on Launch Pad was issued, which was later featured coupled to a mobile transporter as Corporal Erector Vehicle and Missile (1113) released in October 1959. RAF vehicles included RAF [[Land Rover]] (351) issued in May 1958, which was included in Gift Set 4 along with the Bloodhound Guided Missile, and [[Standard Vanguard]] RAF Staff Car (352) which was issued in October 1958. The [[Decca Radar|Decca]] Mobile Airfield Radar Van (1106) released in January 1959 featured a radar scanner which revolved remotely by means of a serrated wheel, and the [[Bedford]] Military Ambulance (414) was issued in January 1961.

In January 1965, in response to a request from the company's American agent, a range of vehicles was produced in the matt green with white star livery of the US Army. These included [[Commer]] Military Ambulance (354), Commer Military Police Van (355), [[Volkswagen]] Military Personnel Carrier (356), Land Rover Weapons Carrier (357), [[Oldsmobile]] HQ Staff Car (358), Army Field Kitchen (359), International Troop Transporter (1113), Bedford Army Fuel Tanker (1134) and Heavy Equipment Transporter (1135). All were updates of existing models from both the standard Corgi range and the Corgi Major range, and sold disappointingly leading to their withdrawal at the end of 1966. This line featured in Corgi catalogues for 1965 &amp; 66.

There were no further military vehicles produced until the 1970s. A range of tanks was introduced in November 1973 with the German [[Tiger I|Tiger Tank]] Mk I (900) and the British [[Centurion Tank]] Mk III (901). It was expanded in 1974 with the releases of U.S. [[M60A1]] Tank (902), the British [[Chieftain Tank]] (903), German [[Tiger II|King Tiger Tank]] (904), Russian [[SU-100]] Tank Destroyer (905) and British [[Alvis Saladin|Saladin Armoured Car]] (906). The Centurion Mk III tank was also included as part of Centurion Tank and Transporter (GS 10) along with a Mack articulated transporter truck. 

The [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|Bell AH-1]]G 'HueyCobra' US Army Helicopter (920) was issued in March 1975, the German [[Hanomag]] [[Sdkfz 251]] Semi-Track Rocket Launcher (907) in July 1975 and the [[Sikorsky Skycrane]] US Army Helicopter (923) in September 1975. Military Gift Set (GS17) included the Bell Helicopter, Tiger I Tank and Saladin Armoured Car. Finally, in October 1976 the French [[AMX-30]] Recovery Tank (908) and British [[Morris C8|Quad Gun Tractor]] and Field Gun (909) were issued.

== Take-Off Wheels and Whizzwheels ==
[[File:Nick's Pics 063.jpg|thumb|left|302 [[Hillman Hunter]] London to Sydney Marathon Winner (Take-Off Wheels)]]

By the late sixties the British toy car market had changed with the arrival from the U.S. of [[Mattel]]'s [[Hot Wheels]] range and their associated track sets. Sales of Corgi Toys began to fall away and matters were not helped by a disastrous fire at the Swansea factory in March 1969 which destroyed a warehouse full of models awaiting delivery. Even one of the company's cleverest innovations the Golden Jacks 'Take-Off Wheels' system which first appeared in March 1968 did little to halt the slide. The authentically detailed die-cast wheels fitted to these models were unique to each model, with the exception of the [[Oldsmobile Toronado]] and the [[Chevrolet Camaro]] which shared a wheel design, and were attached to the axle by means of the 'Golden Jacks' – die-cast golden metal stands, which when folded downwards both released the wheel and supported the model. Only seven models were produced with this feature, with more models like the Ferrari Dino, Lamborghini Miura and Pontiac Firebird planned but ultimately released with Whizzwheels instead.

The [[Mini Marcos]] was a fibreglass-bodied coupe produced by the specialist British sports car manufacturer [[Marcos (automobile)|Marcos]] and was built on the Austin/Morris Mini chassis and fitted with a highly tuned Mini engine. The Corgi model Mini Marcos GT850 (341), finished in metallic red, was the first in the series of Take-Off Wheels models and was introduced in March 1968. The [[Rover P6|Rover 2000]] TC (275) issued a month later in April 1968 and finished in metallic green was a new casting despite Corgi having previously issued a model of the Rover 2000, and was fitted with a clear roof panel as featured on a Rover 2000 displayed on the Triplex stand at the 1965 Earls Court Motor Show, and a plastic spare wheel holder attached to the boot lid which was a popular period extra on the real car. A rare version finished in white with a red interior also exists.

[[File:Nick's Pics 056.jpg|thumb|right|344 [[Ferrari]] 206 Dino ('Red Spot' Whizzwheels)]]

The Oldsmobile Toronado (276) released in June 1968 was an updated version of the earlier 1967 Corgi release of the same model but re-coloured metallic red or metallic yellow, but the metallic gold coloured Chevrolet Camaro SS350 (338) issued in August 1968 was a new model of one of the latest generation 'pony' cars from America. The previously mentioned [[1968 London to Sydney Marathon]] winning Hillman Hunter rally car (302) was issued in July 1969 and was finished in the blue and white of the original. The [[Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow]] Mulliner Park Ward Coupe (273), finished in pearlescent white over grey, was issued in March 1970. A rare version of this model was released in silver over metallic blue which was used as the colour scheme for the later Whizzwheels version. The [[Chevrolet Corvette]] Stingray (300) with detachable roof panels, released in April 1970, was the last of this short-lived line. This model was available in chromed red or green finish called 'Solarbrite' by Corgi and introduced with the Corgi Rockets range the previous year. Spare Take-Off Wheels were available separately in packs of twelve.

Low friction wheels known as 'Whizzwheels' were introduced to keep up with the competition in September 1969 with the Ferrari 206 Dino Sports (344) finished in either red and white or yellow and black. The first incarnation (known to collectors as 'Red Spots') featured rubber tyres and brass hubs with low friction red nylon centres, which though attractive and effective, were expensive to produce and were soon replaced by plastic wheels. Although giving more 'play value', Whizzwheels models are less popular with collectors today as they take away some of the character and realism of the earlier regular wheeled models fitted with rubber tyres. 

==Corgi Comics==
Corgi Toys introduced the Corgi Comics range in 1969 as a range of character based toys aimed at younger children. Noddy's Car (801) featured figures from the Enid Blyton children's novels of '[[Noddy (character)|Noddy]]', 'Big-Ears' and 'Golly' sitting in the rumble seat. Early examples featured a model gollywog with a black painted face but after just a few months the colour was changed to grey. The model was later reissued with 'Teddy' sitting in the rumble seat, perhaps in response to the fact that [[gollywog]]s had become less acceptable by the late 1960s. It was issued again in the 1970s with just 'Noddy' at the wheel. Also released in December 1969 as part of the range was '[[Popeye]]'s Paddlewagon' (802) a half car – half boat featuring 'Popeye', 'Olive Oyl' and 'Swee'pea' from the 'Popeye' cartoon series, and '[[Basil Brush]]'s car (808) featuring a model of the glove puppet fox from the popular British children's television series ''[[The Basil Brush Show]]'' driving a colourful version of the 1911 Renault from the Corgi Classics range.

Also issued at the same time was a range of toys from Serge Danot's animated television series ''[[The Magic Roundabout]]''. These included the 'Magic Roundabout' Carousel (H852), 'Mr Mac Henry's' trike (H859), the 'Magic Roundabout' train (H851) and 'Dougal's' car (807), a modified [[Citroën DS]] featuring models of 'Dougal' the dog, 'Dylan' the rabbit and 'Brian' the snail. Individual figures of all the characters were available, as was a 'Magic Roundabout' Playground set (H853) that included all the models in the 'Magic Roundabout' series as well as a large 'magic garden' base that featured trees and train tracks. The models in the series were all able to run on these tracks, and would move around the 'Magic Garden' at the turn of a large plastic handle. This set is now one of the most valuable of all Corgi Toys products.

== Corgi Kits, Corgi Cargoes, accessories and catalogues ==
During the early 1960s Corgi Toys issued a series of clip-together plastic kits of buildings and street furniture to complement and add further play value to their range of scale vehicles. The first release was the Batley Leofric Garage (601) with opening garage door in May 1960 followed by two street lamps (606) and [[The Automobile Association|AA]] (Automobile Association) and [[Royal Automobile Club|RAC]] (Royal Automobile Club) Telephone Boxes (602) in June 1960. In November 1960 [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] Pits (603) and Silverstone Press Box (604) were added to the range with Silverstone Club House and Timekeepers Box (605) released in March 1963 along with Circus Elephant and Cage (607). In April 1963 the Motel Chalet (611) was issued and in December 1963 a [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]]/[[BP]] Service Station (608) was released, along with Shell/BP Forecourt Accessories (609) and Metropolitan Police and Public Telephone Boxes (610). A series of figures to go with Corgi Kits were released in December 1962; Racing Drivers and Mechanics (1501), Spectators (1502), Race Track Officials (1503), Press Officials (1504) and Garage Attendants (1505). The range culminated with two Gift Sets grouping together most of the releases - Shell/BP Garage Layout (GS25) and Silverstone Racing Layout (GS15) both issued in December 1963.

Designed with the intention of being used in conjunction with the [[Commer]] Platform Lorry (454), Commer Dropside Lorry (452), [[ERF (lorry manufacturer)|ERF]] Platform Lorry (457) and ERF Dropside Lorry (456), Corgi introduced a series of painted die-cast metal 'loads' called Corgi Cargoes. They were packaged in a clear plastic blisters attached to a card featuring the Corgi dog logo, images of Corgi lorries and the range's signature blue and yellow colour scheme. The first to be introduced in February 1960 were Plank Load (1485) and Cement Load (1488), and they were incorporated into Gift Set 11 including the ERF Dropside Lorry and Trailer in March 1960. Brick Load (1486) and Milk Churns Load (1487) followed in July 1960 and Skip and Churns (1490) in September 1960. The last in this range to be released was to be used with the [[Massey Ferguson]] 65 Tractor (50) and was a red painted cast metal platform carrying three metal milk churns which clipped to the rear of the tractor. The packaging featured an image of a tractor. Corgi Cargoes were available until 1964.

In December 1959 Corgi Toys produced packs of stickers which could be affixed to personalise Corgi models. Pack A (1460) included number plates, road fund licenses and GB plates, Pack B (1461) featured sports wheel discs and white-wall tyres, Pack C (1462) contained commercial vehicle items, Pack D (1463) included CD plates and L (learner) plates and Pack E (1464) introduced in December 1961 contained AA and RAC badges and towing plates. Today it is not uncommon to find early Corgi models with such additions still intact.

From 1956 to 1985 a catalogue was issued annually to promote the Corgi range. It was originally a small fold-out single sheet leaflet but by the late 1960s it had evolved into a 48-page colour catalogue. Corgi catalogues are notable for their illustrations and art work that are evocative of the period, and they are now collectable in their own right.

==Decline and demise==
After the phenomenal success of the range during the late 1950s and 1960s, sales remained buoyant in the 1970s, and the company made its biggest profit of £3.5 million in 1978, but the success was to be short lived. In an attempt to keep its products contemporary Mettoy began production of the Dragon computer which was aimed at younger users. The vast expense of this project proved a drain on the company's resources, and together with a toxic combination of high inflation and a strong pound buoyed by the production of North Sea oil, profits were hit hard. The increasing costs of UK based production (Corgi resolutely refused to move production outside the UK) and decreasing sales revenue meant that funds were not sufficient to develop the ingenious toys of the past, and the models now sold in their thousands rather than in the millions that they achieved during their heyday. There were many reasons for the decline of Corgi Toys, and indeed the British toy car industry; not least the changes in tastes of youngsters, the spiralling cost of developing new features that would capture the imagination, and the emergence of computer games consoles. The end finally came in October 1983, when Corgi Toys were  forced to call in the Official Receiver, just three years after the demise of their greatest rival [[Dinky Toys]] and one year after [[Lesney Products|Lesney]] ([[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]]). An era of British toy manufacturing had passed into history. Rest in peace.

==Legacy==
[[File:Corgi Toys Logo 1980's.jpg|thumb|200px|The logo used from 1985 until 1994]]
The Corgi story did not end in the mid-1980s, however, as a management buy-out saw the company re-formed as Corgi Toys Limited in March 1984. This company continued to produce model vehicles, but in smaller numbers than before. The workforce grew but the costs of running the factory at the [[Fforestfach]] site had become higher. Competition was now wholly in the form of products that were being manufactured overseas leading to management moving some of the moulds to China and setting up a joint venture company with a [[Hong Kong]] company called Flying Dragon. 

At the same time it took on contract work producing non-toy items. In 1989 the management sold the Corgi brand to [[Mattel]] and the factory was retained under the name of Microlink Industries Ltd. The products of the Mettoy owned company continue to be prized by collectors worldwide. In recent years the internet has allowed a far wider collector-base than in the past when swapmeets and antique markets were the only places they could be found.

==Corgi Classics Limited==
{{main article|Corgi Classics}}
A management buyout in 1995 saw the end of Mattel ownership and a new company was created, [[Corgi Classics|Corgi Classics Limited]]. On 1 May 2008, Corgi Classics was bought by the international models and collectables group [[Hornby Railways|Hornby]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corgi.biz/press-releases/collectable/Hornby%20Acquire%20Corgi.doc Hornby strengthens product range with £7.5M acquisition of Corgi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205091442/http://corgi.biz/press-releases/collectable/Hornby%20Acquire%20Corgi.doc |date=5 February 2009 }} Retrieved from www.corgi.biz on 13 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crime cinema''', in the broadest sense, is a cinematic genre inspired by and analogous to the [[crime fiction]] literary genre. Films of this genre generally involve various aspects of [[crime]] and its detection. Stylistically, the genre may overlap and combine with many other genres, such as [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] or [[gangster film]], but also include [[Comedy film|comedy]], and, in turn, is divided into many sub-genres, such as [[Mystery film|mystery]], [[suspense]] or [[Film noir|noir]].

== Source of plots ==
Crime films are often based on real events or are [[Film adaptation|adaptation]]s of [[stage play|plays]] or novels. For example, the 1957 film version of ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' is an adaptation of a 1953 [[Witness for the Prosecution (play)|stage play of that name]], which is in turn based on [[Agatha Christie]]'s short story, originally published in 1933. The film version was [[Witness for the Prosecution (1982 film)|remade in 1982]], and there have been other adaptations. However, each of these media has its own advantages and limitations, which in the case of cinema is the time constraint.

== Plays and films ==
[[File:Humphrey Bogart in The Petrified Forest film trailer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Humphrey Bogart]] in ''[[The Petrified Forest]]'' (1936)]]''Witness for the Prosecution'' is a classic example of a "[[courtroom drama]]". In a courtroom drama, a charge is brought against one of the main characters, who claims to be innocent. Another major part is played by the lawyer (in England a [[barrister]]) representing the [[defendant]] in court and battling with the public prosecutor. He or she may enlist the services of a private investigator to find out what really happened and who the real perpetrator is. However, in most cases it is not clear at all whether the accused is guilty of the crime or not—this is how suspense is created.

Often, the private investigator storms into the courtroom at the very last minute in order to bring a new and crucial piece of information to the attention of the court. This type of literature lends itself to the literary genre of drama focused more on dialogue (the opening and closing statements, the witnesses' testimonies, etc.) and little or no necessity for a shift in scenery. The auditorium of the theatre becomes an extension of the courtroom. When a courtroom drama is filmed, the traditional device employed by screenwriters and directors is the frequent use of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], in which the crime and everything that led up to it is narrated and reconstructed from different angles.

In ''Witness for the Prosecution'', Leonard Vole, a young American living in England, is accused of murdering a middle-aged lady he met in the street while shopping. His wife (played by Marlene Dietrich) hires the best lawyer available (Charles Laughton) because she is convinced, or rather she knows, that her husband is innocent. Another classic courtroom drama is U.S. playwright [[Reginald Rose]]'s ''[[Twelve Angry Men (Westinghouse Studio One)|Twelve Angry Men]]'' (1954), which is set in the [[jury]] deliberation room of a [[New York, New York|New York]] Court of Law. Eleven members of the jury, aiming at a unanimous [[verdict]] of "guilty", try to get it over with as quickly as possible. And they would really succeed in achieving their common aim if it were not for the eighth juror (played by [[Henry Fonda]] in the 1957 movie adaptation), who, on second thoughts, considers it his duty to convince his colleagues that the defendant may be innocent after all, and who, by doing so, triggers a lot of discussion, confusion, and anger.

== Subgenres ==
Crime films may fall under several different subgenres. These include:
* Crime action - A hybrid of action and crime films and a subgenre of action films as well. Most films of this kind fall in the category of heist films, prison films and sometimes cop and gangster films. [[Car chase]]s and shootouts are commonly featured. Example include ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', ''[[Baby Driver]]'', ''[[Master (2016 film)|Master]], [[Collateral (film)| Collateral]] and [[Heat (1995 film) |Heat]].
* Crime comedy – A hybrid of crime and comedy films. [[Mafia comedy]] looks at organized crime from a comical standpoint. Humor comes from the incompetence of the criminals and/or [[black comedy]]. Examples include ''[[Analyze This]]'', ''[[The Pope of Greenwich Village]]'', ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'', ''[[In Bruges]]'', ''[[Mafia!]]'', ''[[Tower Heist]]'' and ''[[Pain &amp; Gain]]''.
* [[Crime drama]] – A combination of crime and dramatic films. Examples include such films as ''[[Straight Time]]'' and ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]''.
* Crime thriller – A [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] in which the central characters are involved in crime, either in its investigation, as the perpetrator or, less commonly, a victim (generally, this is just a thriller). While some action films could be labelled as such for merely having criminality and thrills, the emphasis in this genre is the drama and the investigative/criminal methods. Examples include ''[[Untraceable]]'', ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|Silence of the Lambs]]'', ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'', ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'', ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'', ''[[Memories of Murder]]'', ''[[The Call (2013 film)|The Call]]'', and ''[[Running Scared (2006 film)|Running Scared]]''.
* [[Dacoit film]] – A genre of [[Indian cinema]] (including [[Bollywood]]) revolving around [[dacoity]]. The genre was pioneered by [[Mehboob Khan]]'s ''[[Aurat (1940 film)|Aurat]]'' (1940) and ''[[Mother India]]'' (1957). Other examples include ''[[Gunga Jumna]]'' (1961), ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) and ''[[Bandit Queen]]'' (1994).
* [[Film noir]] – A genre popular in the 1940s and 1950s often fall into the crime and [[mystery film|mystery]] genres. [[Private investigator|Private detectives]] hired to solve a crime are in such films as ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'', ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'', ''[[L.A. Confidential]]'', ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'', and ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''. [[Neo-noir]] refers to modern films influenced by film noir such as ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]''.
* [[Gangster film]] – a genre of film that focuses on [[gang]]s and [[organized crime]].
* [[Heist film]] – This film deals with a group of criminals attempting to perform a theft or robbery, as well as the possible consequences that follow. Heist films that are lighter in tone are called "Caper films". Examples include ''[[The Killing (film)|The Killing]]'', ''[[Ocean's Eleven (1960 film)|Oceans 11]]'', ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]'', ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'', and ''[[The Town (2010 film)|The Town]]''.
* [[Heroic bloodshed]] – a [[Hong Kong action cinema]] crime film genre. The genre was pioneered by [[John Woo]]'s ''[[A Better Tomorrow]]'' (1986) and [[Ringo Lam]]'s ''[[City on Fire (1987 film)|City on Fire]]'' (1987), starring [[Chow Yun-fat]]. Elements of the genre can be seen in Hollywood crime films since the 1990s, such as the work of John Woo and [[Quentin Tarantino]].
* [[Hood film]] – Film dealing with [[African-American]] urban issues and culture. They do not always revolve around crime, but often criminal activity features heavily in the storyline. Examples include ''[[Menace II Society]]'' and ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''.
* [[Legal drama]] – Not usually concerned with the actual crime so much as the trial in the aftermath. A typical plot would involve a lawyer trying to prove the [[innocence]] of his or her client. Examples include ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' and ''[[A Time to Kill (1996 film)|A Time To Kill]]''.
* [[Mafia film]] – Film which focuses on characters who are involved seriously with the [[Mafia]] or [[organized crime]]. Notable mob films include: ''[[The Godfather]]'', ''[[Goodfellas]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'', ''[[Bugsy]]'', ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'', ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[The Public Enemy]]'', ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'', and ''[[The Departed]]''.
* [[Mumbai underworld films|Mumbai underworld]] – an [[Indian cinema]] crime film genre, often produced in [[Bollywood]]. The genre frequently draws inspiration from real [[Mumbai underworld]] gangsters, such as [[Haji Mastan]], [[Dawood Ibrahim]] and [[D-Company]].

'''''Crysis 2''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Crytek]], published by [[Electronic Arts]] and released in North America, Australia and Europe in March 2011 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]]. Officially announced on June 1, 2009, the game is the second main installment of the [[Crysis|''Crysis'' series]], and is the sequel to the 2007 video game ''[[Crysis (video game)|Crysis]]'', and its expansion ''[[Crysis Warhead]]''.&lt;ref name="InCrysis Interview with Cevat Yerli"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incrysis.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=559 |title=InCrysis Interview with Cevat Yerli |date=November 15, 2007 |accessdate=November 16, 2007 |publisher=InCrysis |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116105023/http://www.incrysis.com/index.php?option=com_content |archivedate=November 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was written by [[Richard K.

A sequel, ''[[Crysis 3]]'', was released in 2013.

==Gameplay==
''Crysis 2'' is a [[first-person shooter]]. The player assumes the role of a Force Recon Marine called Alcatraz. Similar to its predecessor, it provides freedom to customize weaponry and abilities. Crytek wanted to avoid making another game set in a true jungle environment (as were ''[[Far Cry (video game)|Far Cry]]'' and ''[[Crysis (video game)|Crysis]]''); New York City has been dubbed an "urban jungle". The urban atmosphere offers new options with relation to progressing and planning attacks. Players are able to navigate between floors and buildings, as well as a destroyed cityscape.

===Campaign===
The player assumes the control of a Force Recon Marine named "Alcatraz", who gains ownership of the Nanosuit 2.0 from Army Delta Force officer Laurence "Prophet" Barnes, who returns from the original ''[[Crysis (video game)|Crysis]]''. CryNet Systems has been hunting Prophet to retrieve the suit, inadvertently pursuing Alcatraz, believing he is Prophet. The aliens seen in the original game have undergone a major redesigning, abandoning the ancient, tentacled exosuits seen in the first game for high-tech humanoid armored war machines that stalk Alcatraz through the ravaged New York City. Crytek stated prior to release that their intention was to surpass the original game graphically&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/scitech/report_a-game-changing-session_1354144|title=A game-changing session|accessdate=March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gameplay-wise while also having lower system requirements and also supporting true [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic 3D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Crysis-Crysis-2-FPS-multiplayer,10656.html|title=Crysis 2 Supports 3D Singleplayer, Multiplayer|accessdate=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Nanosuit supports new and upgraded features. Suit functionality has been streamlined; multiple modes can easily be used simultaneously whenever the user wishes. The first suit's Strength and Speed Modes have been combined into the new Power Mode, the suit binoculars function has been upgraded with an advanced Tactical mode, the Cloaking Device has been modified to allow increased sensory input and silent melee stealth kills and has been renamed to Stealth Mode, while the Armor Mode has been left more or less as is, with the exception of slightly restricted agility and an ever-decreasing energy level. There are two trailers, with one trailer showing the suit in a wire-frame state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKaWucgzOto |title= Crysis 2 Nanosuit 2 Wireframe trailer |date= August 28, 2009 |accessdate= September 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the other showing the suit in a complete state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5CmCyXMPhQ&amp;feature=related |title= Crysis 2 Nanosuit 2 Trailer |accessdate= April 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In-fiction, the suit is to feature many improvements over its predecessor, giving soldiers freedom to upgrade their suits based on their own style of combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://terminalgamer.com/2010/01/20/crysis-2-new-york-city/|title= Crysis 2: New York City |date= January 20, 2010 | accessdate= January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Characters and setting===
''Crysis 2'' takes place in 2023,&lt;ref name="VGamerNews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vgamernews.com/reviews/786/crysis-2-review/|title=Crysis 2 Review|last=Garner|first=A|date=May 21, 2011|accessdate=May 10, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320053031/http://vgamernews.com/reviews/786/crysis-2-review/|archivedate=March 20, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; three years after the events of the first game, in a destroyed [[New York City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crynetsystems.com/ |title=Crynet systems |date=January 20, 2010 |accessdate=January 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116181208/http://www.crynetsystems.com/ |archivedate=January 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has since been evacuated due to alien infestation. The game begins with news footage of a large outbreak of the "Manhattan" virus, a gruesome disease that causes complete cellular breakdown; civil unrest; and panic about an alien invasion by the Ceph, the tentacled, squid-like alien race behind the incident of the previous game, ''Crysis''. Due to the breakdown in social order within [[New York City]], [[Manhattan]] is placed under [[martial law]], and under contract from the [[US Department of Defense]], soldiers from Crynet Enforcement &amp; Local Logistics (or simply "CELL"), a [[private military contractor]] run by the Crynet corporation, police the chaos.

===Plot===
On August 23, 2023, a [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Force Recon]] unit is deployed into New York City by the submarine USS ''Nautilus'' to extract former Crynet employee Doctor Nathan Gould, who may have vital information on combating the alien race. However, insertion goes awry - the Ceph, the alien race that is trying to destroy humanity, sinks the sub, mortally wounding Force Recon Marine "Alcatraz." [[Delta Force]] [[Major]] Laurence "Prophet" Barnes saves Alcatraz and is forced to kill himself in order for his Nanosuit to assimilate and revive Alcatraz. A recording left in the suit reveals that Prophet had been infected by the Manhattan virus, and that Alcatraz is to finish Prophet's mission to rescue humanity from the alien invasion. Believing Alcatraz is Prophet, Gould soon gets in contact with Alcatraz and asks him to meet up at Gould's lab. However, CELL forces, led by [[Commander]] Dominic Lockhart, target and attack Alcatraz, believing him to be Prophet. While on his way to Gould's laboratory, Alcatraz collects alien tissue samples from a crashed Ceph dropship and a Ceph soldier, which cause strange reactions within his Nanosuit, giving him some alien abilities. Alcatraz eventually meets with Gould, who is initially hostile after learning that he is not Prophet. However the last suit recording of Prophet's message causes Gould to relent, prompting Gould to explain that the suit has been busy rewriting its own code after absorbing the Ceph's tissue, speculating that the suit was creating an antibody for the Manhattan virus. Gould and Alcatraz commit to further scans at a Crynet base on [[Wall Street]]. The scans are cut short when CELL forces led by Commander Lockhart and [[Lieutenant]] Tara Strickland, daughter of U.S. Marine Corps Major Strickland from the first game, ambush Alcatraz and Gould.

During the middle of a prisoner transfer outside of the building, the Ceph attack the CELL personnel as a massive alien spire rises from underneath the Crynet building, releasing a spore-based [[bioweapon]] that kills most of the CELL troops in the immediate area. Alcatraz is left stranded and isolated for a period of time while dealing with a Nanosuit malfunction caused by the spore bio-weapon.  The suit gets rebooted remotely by Crynet director and Hargreave-Rasch Biotechnologies co-founder Jacob Hargreave, a [[centenarian]] who apparently had foreknowledge of the Ceph and had spent most of the previous century using stolen Ceph technology to design the Nanosuit to be used as a defense against the aliens. Hargreave directs Alcatraz to another Ceph spire to conduct an important experiment for him.

On the way to the spire, Hargreave reveals to Alcatraz that the Manhattan virus had been spread by the Ceph as a method to clear out the entire human population from Earth, comparing it to the previous century's [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE outbreak]]. The Manhattan virus would cause all infected humans to eventually melt down into a liquidated mass of biological tissue, which could then be easily stored and disposed of. Upon reaching the alien spire, Alcatraz attempts to interface the Nanosuit's systems with the aliens' technology, but fails. During this crisis, the [[US Department of Defense]] rescinds the authority of CELL over Manhattan and deploys [[US Marines]] in their place under the command of Marine Colonel Sherman Barclay. The American forces attempt to drown the aliens out of lower Manhattan by ordering an [[air strike]] on the city's [[flood barrier]]. Washed away by the resulting wave of water, Alcatraz is later found in [[Madison Square Park]] by a squad of Marines led by Alcatraz's squadmate Chino, who survived the submarine's destruction. The Marines enlist his aid in evacuating civilians to [[Grand Central Terminal]], the city's primary evacuation point.

Hargreave contacts Alcatraz to take a detour to the Hargreave-Rasch building. There, Alcatraz is told to find a stabilizing agent in the bio-lab to facilitate the Nanosuit's analyzing process. The trip ends fruitless after Ceph interference,  with Hargreave telling Alcatraz to help with evacuation efforts at Grand Central. At the terminal, Alcatraz is reunited with Gould, who had apparently "escaped" Strickland, leading to the skepticism of Colonel Barclay. Grand Central Terminal is overrun by Ceph forces, but Alcatraz manages to hold them off long enough for the evacuation trains to depart, and escapes the building's destruction.

Alcatraz is then tasked with defending a secondary evacuation point at [[Times Square]], and this time manages to repurpose an alien spire's spores to be lethal to the Ceph. This causes a cataclysmic self-destruction of the Ceph in the area, and apparently removes all traces of the biological warfare agent. With the evacuation from Times Square complete, Gould instructs Alcatraz to make his way to [[Roosevelt Island]]. There, Alcatraz is told to infiltrate a Crynet complex named "The Prism", where Hargreave resides. Alcatraz foils Commander Lockhart's attempts to ambush him, and kills the commander in the process. As Alcatraz makes his way through the island, he is suddenly captured by Hargreave, who wants the Nanosuit for himself so that he can finish off the Ceph personally. Hargreave then attempts to remove the Nanosuit from Alcatraz's body. However, the Nanosuit rejects its removal from Alcatraz since it had already completely assimilated with its wearer, revealing memories of Prophet's fallout with Hargreave in the process. Having seen Prophet's flashbacks whilst on the operating table, Alcatraz and his suit regain their power. A CELL guard is ordered to execute Alcatraz but he is killed by Strickland, who reveals herself to be an undercover [[CIA]] operative responsible for Alcatraz's deployment.  Strickland tells Alcatraz to capture Hargreave, but upon entering Hargreave's private office, Alcatraz instead sees Hargreave's body in a vegetative state stored in a [[Cryonics|cryonic]] chamber. Hargreave reveals to Alcatraz that the entire time, his consciousness had been communicating through an advanced computer system, and that this had been the only way for him to communicate ever since he was injured in an [[Tunguska Event|encounter with the Ceph at Tunguska]]. Hargreave gives Alcatraz a last Nanosuit upgrade, the "Tunguska Iteration", before the Ceph invade the island. Hargreave triggers a countdown timer for the self-destruct system of the complex, and orders the remaining CELL forces guarding the Crynet Prism complex to aid Alcatraz's exfiltration.  Alcatraz barely escapes the massive explosion of the complex, which destroys much of Roosevelt Island and the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. On the shores of Manhattan, Alcatraz reunites with Gould, Strickland and Chino.

Alcatraz is notified by Colonel Barclay that the [[US Department of Defense]] plans to launch a [[STRATCOM]] [[tactical nuclear weapon|Tactical Nuclear Strike]] on Manhattan Island with little regard to collateral damage and [[nuclear fallout]]. Alcatraz and his comrades make their way through the city toward the center of the alien infestation, and spot a massive alien "litho-ship" rising out of the ground beneath [[Central Park]], lifting a large section of the park into the air. With the peripheral aid of Gould, Strickland, and Barclay, Alcatraz assaults the floating section of Central Park, where he has a 20-minute window to end the conflict with the Ceph before they launch the nuclear missile, and succeeds in making his way to the alien spire at its center, which serves as a massive dispersal point for the alien spore bio-weapon. Alcatraz successfully turns the spire's bio-weapon against the Ceph, causing the Ceph in the entire city to self-destruct. After several days, the city begins to recover with the help of Gould, Strickland, and the US Military. Alcatraz, while unconscious, communicates with Prophet, whose memories, experiences, and personality had been stored in the suit. Prophet tells Alcatraz that, while the mission in New York is a success, their work is not yet over since the Ceph, who had been present on Earth since prehistoric times, had built constructs globally that were not only limited to New York and the Lingshan Islands. The Nanosuit then assimilates Prophet's memories into Alcatraz. Upon waking up in Central Park, Alcatraz receives a broadcast from Karl Ernst Rasch, the other founder of Hargreave-Rasch Biotechnologies, asking for his name. Climbing out of the crater, Alcatraz, speaking for the first time since donning the Nanosuit, responds, repeating the same phrase as Prophet, in the beginning of the game: "They call me Prophet."

==Development==
''Crysis 2'' was announced at [[E3 2009]] on June 1, 2009, and was in development from 2007. ''Crysis 2'' is the sequel to 2007's ''[[Crysis (video game)|Crysis]]'' which was lauded for its impressive visuals. German-based studio [[Crytek]], which developed the first game, is the lead developer of the sequel, along with help from [[Crytek UK]], formerly Free Radical. It is the first game using the new engine [[CryEngine 3]]. The Microsoft Windows version is built on DirectX 9, with an optional DirectX 11 add-on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mycrysis.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=196147#p196147 |title=Crysis 2 news and updates |publisher=Crytek |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720212236/http://www.mycrysis.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=196147#p196147 |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crytek looked to surpass the original ''Crysis'', which was still a benchmark of PC graphical performance in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/crysis-2/61-26754/ |title=Crysis 2 (video game) |publisher=GiantBomb |date= |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, 2010 EA announced that there would be two special editions of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ea.com/news/two-special-editions-for-crysis-2|title=EA and Crytek Unveil Two Special Editions for Crysis 2 |date= August 17, 2010 | accessdate= August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Limited Edition of ''Crysis 2'' is available at the same price as the regular game, but in limited quantities. It comes with bonus experience points to "immediately boost the player up to Rank 5, giving access to all the preset class loadouts",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://kotaku.com/5615224/crysis-2-nano-edition-is-big-official-for-the-ultimate-crysis-fan|title= Crysis 2 Nano Edition Is Big, Official, For 'The Ultimate Crysis Fan' |date= August 17, 2010 | accessdate= August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a digital camo weapon skin for the SCAR, the "Hologram Decoy" attachment for the SCAR, and unique in-game platinum dog tags.
The Indian Version, on pre-order, also includes the Threat Tracer Suit Module (Early Access), and, on buying from the EA store, a gold dog tag and desert camo for SCAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eastore.ea.com/store/easa/en_IN/DisplayProductDetailsPage/ThemeID.1220200/productID.184052400 |title=EA Store India |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303185544/http://eastore.ea.com/store/easa/en_IN/DisplayProductDetailsPage/ThemeID.1220200/productID.184052400 |archivedate=March 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nano Edition of ''Crysis 2'', which was only available through pre-order, includes the Limited Edition copy of the game in a Steelbook case, an 11" statue of Alcatraz posed on top of a New York City taxi, an art book, and a Nanosuit backpack "modeled after the in-game super suit." The Nanosuit backpack is large enough to accommodate a 17" laptop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web-vassets.ea.com/Assets/Richmedia/Image/Backgrounds/crysis2_ne_large_4.jpg |title=Crysis 2 - Nano Edition |accessdate=March 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710162043/http://web-vassets.ea.com/Assets/Richmedia/Image/Backgrounds/crysis2_ne_large_4.jpg |archivedate=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 26, 2010, the Nano Edition was made available for pre-order on the EA website for a $149.95 price tag but was sold out before March 2011. After the game's launch, those who preordered the Nano Edition had their shipment delayed. EA gave the affected customers a 75% off coupon and later a free digital copy of Crysis 2 Limited Edition as compensation.

In May 2012, ''Crysis 2: Maximum Edition'' was released for Microsoft Windows. It included the game and previously released DLC, including nine additional multiplayer maps and new game modes for them, two new weapons (FY71 Assault Rifle and M18 Smoke Grenades), the Scar weapon skin, a Scar hologram decoy to attach to the player's weapon, platinum dog tags, and access to bonus XP through custom and preset classes. Also included is the high resolution texture pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://help.ea.com/article/crysis-2-maximum-edition-details |title=Crysis 2&amp;#124;Crysis 2 Maximum Edition Details&amp;#124;EA Help |publisher=Help.ea.com |date=May 23, 2012 |accessdate=August 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701150834/https://help.ea.com/article/crysis-2-maximum-edition-details |archivedate=July 1, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiplayer demo===
EA and [[Crytek]] launched a multiplayer demo of ''Crysis 2'' on January 25, 2011. Crytek announced that the demo would only be available until February 4, 2011. The demo was on the Xbox 360, for Gold members to download, although on January 27, Crytek confirmed that there would be a multiplayer demo for Microsoft Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/crysis2/news.html?sid=6291743 |title= PC Crysis 2 multiplayer demo inbound |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date= January 28, 2011 |accessdate=February 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The demo featured the maps  Skyline and Pier 17, as well as two multiplayer game modes to play: Team Instant Action and Crash Site. Team Instant Action puts two teams against one another in a team deathmatch style, while Crash Site has players defending alien drop pods like control points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neoseeker.com/news/15649-crysis-2-multiplayer-demo-coming-january-25-xbox-live-exclusive/|title= Multiplayer Demo Announcement |date= January 21, 2011 | accessdate= January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within hours of its release, thousands of complaints were reported after numbers of players were met with disconnects from games, crashing during loading and, oddly, a temperamental incompatibility with the Xbox Wireless WiFi adaptor. Crytek issued a statement telling players it was aware of "technical issues" with the Xbox multiplayer demo of ''Crysis 2'', and managed to fix most of the issues in time for the PC demo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/285609/news/crytek-working-on-crysis-2-demo-technical-issues/ |title= Crytek working on Crysis 2 demo 'technical issues' |publisher=CAG |date=January 26, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bugs still exist as of the current trial build but are mostly if not entirely visual and do not noticeably affect game play.

Speaking at an EA event to [[PlayStation Universe]], ''Crysis 2'' producer Nathan Camarillo said that a PlayStation 3 version was possible, also stating there would be no difference in quality between the PlayStation 3 version of ''Crysis 2'' and the Xbox 360 one, which had seen a pre-release demo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/289660/news/ps3-players-can-probably-hope-for-crysis-2-demo/ |title=PS3 players 'can probably hope for' Crysis 2 demo |date=February 18, 2011 |accessdate=February 19, 2011  |publisher=CVG}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crytek released the first footage of ''Crysis 2'' running on PlayStation 3 on February 24, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/02/24/first-crysis-2-ps3-footage-appears-multiplayer-beta-coming-soon/ |title=First Crysis 2 PS3 video appears, multiplayer beta coming soon |date=February 24, 2011 |accessdate=February 24, 2011  |publisher=VG247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/290960/crysis-2-ps3-demo-coming-soon-360-and-pc-coming-march-1/ |title=New Crysis 2 multiplayer demo hitting 360 and PC March 1, PS3 version 'coming soon' |date=February 25, 2011 |accessdate=February 26, 2011  |publisher=CVG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second ''Crysis 2'' multiplayer demo was released on March 1, 2011 on both Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mycrysis.com/news/crysis_2/crysis-2-multiplayer-demo-goes-multiplatform-on-march-1/ |title=Crysis 2 Multiplayer Demo Goes Multiplatform on March 1 |date=February 25, 2011 |accessdate=February 25, 2011 |publisher=MyCrysis |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228183155/http://www.mycrysis.com/news/crysis_2/crysis-2-multiplayer-demo-goes-multiplatform-on-march-1 |archivedate=February 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among bug fixes from the first beta, the map 'Pier 17' was added to the Xbox version and extended to the PC version. PC gamers have commented on Xbox 360 remnants in the PC demo version, such as the prompt to "press start to begin"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/03/01/press-start-to-begin-crysis-2-multi-player-demo-now-available/ |title=Press Start To Begin: Crysis 2 Multi-Player Demo Now Available |author=Nicholas Deleon |publisher=[[TechCrunch]] |date=March 1, 2011 |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to "adjust your TV settings" when configuring the game brightness. It has also been reported that the PC version would not be released with support for [[DirectX 11]], which will instead be implemented with a patch "later on".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sweclockers.com/nyhet/13594-crysis-2-endast-dx9-dx11-kommer-senare|title=Crysis 2 endast DX9 – DX11 kommer "senare"|publisher=SweClockers.com|author=Andreas Dimestam|date=March 1, 2011|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 8, 2011, Crytek announced – still without marking delivery date – that a DirectX 11 patch was being worked on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mycrysis.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;t=22276&amp;sid=e1613a77272ec5a0e52b835c8b3434c9|title=DX11 Patch Announced for Crysis 2!|publisher=mycrysis.com|author=Cry-Tom|date=April 8, 2011|accessdate=April 9, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720212153/http://www.mycrysis.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;t=22276&amp;sid=e1613a77272ec5a0e52b835c8b3434c9|archivedate=July 20, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2011, a multiplayer demo was released on the PlayStation Network, featuring both of the maps featured on the Xbox 360 version of the demo, being 'Pier 17' and 'Skyline'. On March 18, it was removed from the Store and the servers were shut down due to server connection delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ea.com/crysis-2/blog/ps3-demo-ending-soon |title=PlayStation 3 Demo Ending Soon |author=Electronic Arts |date=March 17, 2011 |publisher=EA.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321035222/http://www.ea.com/crysis-2/blog/ps3-demo-ending-soon |archivedate=March 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaked beta===
A beta version of the game dated from January was leaked on multiple [[Torrent file|torrent sites]] on February 11, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/02/12/crysis-2-build-including-multiplayer-reportedly-leaked/ |title=Crysis 2 build including multiplayer reportedly leaked |author=David Hinkle |publisher=Joystiq |date=February 12, 2011 |accessdate=February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ea.com/crysis-2/blog/crysis-leak |title=Crysis 2 Leaked |publisher=[[Electronic Arts]] |date=February 11, 2011 |accessdate=February 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215072107/http://www.ea.com/crysis-2/blog/crysis-leak |archivedate=February 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Online reports indicated that the leaked beta is a partially functioning developer's build compiled on January 13, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://exophase.com/21398/leaked-crysis-2-beta-hits-torrent-sites/ Leaked Crysis 2 Beta Hits Torrent Sites]. eXophase.com (February 11, 2011). Retrieved on 2011-03-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaked version included the entire single-player campaign and multiplayer component, but contained numerous bugs, was plagued by frequent crashes, and was only partially completed with many placeholders and textures missing and was limited to DirectX 9, rather than the DirectX 11 which was expected in the retail game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/news/59050/Crysis-2-PC-Multiplayer-Master-Key-Leaks-39-Days-Prior-To-Release Crysis 2 PC &amp; Multiplayer Master Key Leaks 39 Days Prior To Release - Voodoo Extreme].

Crytek released a statement saying they were "deeply disappointed" in piracy, which "continues to damage the PC packaged goods market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/#!5758399/crysis-2-has-been-leaked-creators-deeply-disappointed |title=Crysis 2 Leaked, Creators 'Deeply Disappointed' |publisher=Kotaku |date=February 11, 2011 |accessdate=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reviewers remarked that Crytek's statement was strange, considering that no PC demo of the game had been released yet, and moreover, the source of the leaked beta was almost certainly an internal employee (rather than pirates).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nofrag.com/2011/fev/12/36954/ |title=Crytek et EA se lamentent du leak de Crysis 2 |publisher=[[NoFrag]] |date=February 12, 2011 |quote=''As usual, Crytek adopt the Calimero attitude, lamenting on the expected bad sells of the game on the PC platform, a platform for which they forgot to release a Demo (Comme d'habitude, Crytek adopte l'attitude Caliméro, se plaignant dès à présent des futures mauvaises ventes du jeu sur PC, une plate-forme sur laquelle ils ont oublié de sortir une démo de leur jeu)'' |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 14, 2011, Crytek released a statement by Cevat Yerli that stated that despite their disappointment caused by the leak incident, Crytek is overwhelmed with the support they have received and they can assure the community that PC gaming is very important to them now and in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dasreviews.com/das-game-news/cevat-yerli-pc-gaming-important-important-crytek-future/ Cevat Yerli: PC gaming is very important to us and will always be important to Crytek in the future].

Crytek producer Nathan Camarillo called the ''Crysis 2'' game leak a "really ugly version" that the studio did not want people to see: 

{{quote|Piracy is a real concern. The PS3 has been cracked now as well and people are downloading PS3 games and 360 games are being downloaded so that's a threat to just the industry in general. For us specifically, it was a very traumatic experience because we're really excited about the game and the quality that we were able to get into it and what we were able to accomplish... We're at the end and we're really excited about where we're at and your game gets leaked. And it's not even that the final version of the game gets leaked, you know? People are like 'It's 40/45 days before launch, ''Crysis'' is leaked' but that build was already from the middle of January. With 250 people working on a project, thousands of bugs get fixed in a heartbeat. So that version is like a really ugly version that we don't want anyone to see... All this stuff starts going up in pieces and even if someone downloads it and plays it themselves they might make a bad decision based on the fact that there are so many bugs in it. 'Oh, there are so many bugs in the game I wanted to play. It's so buggy, I'm not gonna buy it now.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/289881/news/crysis-2-game-leak-is-a-really-ugly-version/ |title=Crysis 2 game leak is 'a really ugly version' |date=February 21, 2011 |accessdate=February 22, 2011  |publisher=CVG}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the beginning of 2012, PC Gamer reported that Crysis 2 was the most pirated PC game of 2011 with 3.9 millions downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/01/03/crysis-2-most-pirated-pc-game-of-2011/|title=Crysis 2 most pirated PC game of 2011|accessdate=January 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downloadable content==
The first post-launch [[downloadable content]] (DLC) package, titled ''Crysis 2: Retaliation'', was announced on May 10, 2011. ''Retaliation'' features four new multiplayer maps - Park Avenue, Transit, Shipyard, and Compound. It was released on May 18, 2011 for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerandvideogames.com/300706/news/crysis-2-retaliation-map-pack-arrives-next-week-first-trailer/ Crysis 2 'Retaliation' map pack arrives next week - first trailer]&lt;/ref&gt; On June 14, 2011 a second map pack entitled ''Decimation'' was released for the Xbox 360 and PC. It included five new maps (5th Avenue, Chasm, Plaza, Prism, and Apartments) as well as two new weapons (FY71 Assault Rifle and the Smoke Grenade). ''Decimation'' was released onto the PlayStation 3 platform on June 28 in North America and June 29 in Europe.

''Crysis 2'' received positive reviews from critics. The reviewers praised various graphical attributes as well as the empowering Nanosuit, but criticized the [[linear gameplay|linearity of the gameplay]] in contrast to its [[open world]] predecessors, ''[[Crysis (video game)|Crysis]]'' and ''[[Crysis Warhead]]'', as well as [[Crytek]]'s acclaimed debut title ''[[Far Cry]]''. [[Review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]] rated the PC version 86/100,&lt;ref name="MCPC" /&gt; the Xbox 360 version 84/100,&lt;ref name="MCX360" /&gt; and the PlayStation 3 version 85/100.&lt;ref name="MCPS3" /&gt;

One early review of ''Crysis 2'' was published by ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'', which gave the game a 9/10. According to the magazine, it was the multiplayer that tipped the balance. It describes the online experience as "some of the most exciting, angry and satisfying action you'll ever have". The sheer spectacle of the single player campaign also left ''OXM'' impressed, and the magazine said the game's Nanosuit "is both massively empowering and intelligently balanced by the need to manage its energy levels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/292287/news/crysis-2-review-9/10-in-oxm/ |title=Crysis 2 review - 9/10 in OXM |date=March 7, 2011 |accessdate=March 8, 2011 |publisher=CVG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gamereactor]] reviewed all versions simultaneously and awarded the game a 9/10, noting that "its design is an exciting contrast to the jungles of the original, and New York is filled with destroyed landmarks, ruined neighbourhoods and the beauty of disaster that Cevat talked about. The amount of detail is insane, and the effects are incredible." On the other hand, the reviewers criticized the story, noting "the dialogue often feels over the top and the characters feel flat and uninteresting. Crytek have clearly been inspired by ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', but they never even come close to Valve's league despite their high ambitions." They concluded that "it would simply be a shame not to call this the best action game so far this year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamereactor.eu/reviews/6760/Crysis+2/ |title=Crysis 2 review - 9/10 from Gamereactor |date=March 16, 2011 |accessdate=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review for the PlayStation 3 version only was published by ''[[PlayStation Official Magazine (UK)|Official PlayStation Magazine]]'', which gave the game an 8/10. ''OPM'' calls ''Crysis 2'' "excellent - technically strong, visually outstanding and full of welcome fresh ideas." ''OPM''{{'}}s main gripes are with the shooter's "bungled" opening section, and their view that it takes several hours of "persisting" through "a thorny, poorly signposted and indifferent shooter" until ''Crysis 2'' really kicks off. "Developer Crytek has a deserved reputation for pushing gaming hardware to the brink, and its debut work on PS3 is first-rate," it says. "It doesn't just look good, it looks different. The Manhattan mix of crooked concrete spires and green urban spaces is refreshing after the relentless dark khaki backgrounds of ''[[Call of Duty]]'' and ''[[Medal of Honor (2010 video game)|Medal of Honor]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/293334/news/crysis-2-review-8/10-in-official-playstation-mag/ |title=Crysis 2 review - 8/10 in Official PlayStation Mag |date=March 14, 2011 |accessdate=March 14, 2011 |publisher=CVG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' considered that the game heavily borrowed from the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' shooters, being much more scripted and linear than ''[[Crysis (video game)|Crysis]]'', calling the game a "walled in" experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8398164/Crysis-2-review.html |title=Crysis 2 review |date=March 22, 2011|accessdate=March 22, 2011 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|quote=''Crysis 2 borrows more from the Call of Duty school of shooters than it does from its predecessor(...)It's soon clear that playing as Alcatraz, Crysis 2's protagonist, is designed to be a cinematic, often scripted experience''}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Telegraph'' also criticized the enemies' "utterly atrocious" [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]], "problematic" sound, and "uninspiring" multiplayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8398164/Crysis-2-review.html |title=Crysis 2 review |date=March 22, 2011|accessdate=March 22, 2011 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|quote=''But it's massively uninspiring stuff. If you haven't played any popular FPS title in the last five years, and you don't own any of them either, then ''Crysis 2''{{'}}s multiplayer mode is as good an FPS multiplayer to get into as any. But if you have, and you're already invested in another game, then this carbon copy''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GameZone gave the game an 8.5/10, stating "With plenty of in-game collectibles in both the multiplayer and single-player modes, as well as solid multiplayer gameplay options, players will find plenty of bang for their buck, and the stunning power of the CryEngine needs to be seen to be believed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://xbox.gamezone.com/reviews/item/crysis_2/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531165908/http://xbox.gamezone.com/reviews/item/crysis_2/|date=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Form-versus-content humour''' is a type of [[humour]] in an [[:wikt:incongruity|incongruity]] between a statement's content and the way it is communicated makes it humorous. It is one of the basic techniques of [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] humour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How to Laugh Your Way Through Life: A Psychoanalyst's Advice |first=Paul |last=Marcus |publisher=Karnac Books |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[form and content|Form-versus-content]] humour can be delivered, for example, by presenting a message in a form that inherently defeats the ostensible purpose of the message, or in a form that is fundamentally incapable of carrying the important part of the message. The ''[[Jargon File]]'' gives an example of this type of humor: a red [[index card]] with GREEN written on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/h/hackerhumor.html |title=hacker humor |website=The Jargon File, version 4.4.8 |editor=Eric S.

The GameCity Festival has run annually in Nottingham since 2006.

Gamecity 3 was held over [[Halloween]] 2008. To coincide with this, GameCity arranged a successful world record attempt at the largest number of people to dress as [[zombies]] in one place. The record was set to 1227 people, although even more 'unregistered zombies' were present at the attempt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamecity.org/live-from-gamecity/] {{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the 2008 event, the [[National Videogame Archive]] for the UK was launched with the ''Save the Videogame'' campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalvideogamearchive.org/] {{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethevideogame.org/] {{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was led by the recording of the first public Director Commentary event, with [[Martin Hollis (video game designer)|Martin Hollis]] and [[David Doak]] playing [[Goldeneye 64]] live.

GameCity Squared took place from the 27th to 31 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamecity.org/blog/dates09 |title=GameCity 4 Dates Announced |accessdate=2009-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420150203/http://gamecity.org/blog/dates09 |archivedate=20 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Events in 2009 included: Brickstock (a LEGO Rock Band celebration); Elite: Paper Universe - which celebrated 25 years of Elite by bringing together [[David Braben]], [[Ian Bell (programmer)|Ian Bell]], [[Robert Holdstock]] and others involved in its creation; Crysis: LIVE - a large scale re-enactment of [[Crysis]]; and various industry talks from [[Jagex]] and [[Masaya Matsuura]]. The final location of the [[Keita Takahashi]]-designed playground was also revealed as being Woodthorpe Grange Park in Nottingham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamecity.org/brands/gamecity_squared/calendar] {{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GameCity 7 took place in Nottingham from the 20th to 27 October 2012. There were several events held over the 8 day festival, including keynotes from Leigh Alexander, [[Phil Fish]], [[Adam Saltsman]], Ed Stern and many more. The festival also had the first UK showing of the LEGO: Lord of the Rings game, demonstrated by LEGO's Creative Director Jonathan Smith. A World Record was broken on the final day of the festival, as GameCity attempted to host the World's Largest Practical Science experiment. 292 people participated in the event, succeeding the previous record of 276.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-20100307|title=Science lesson record is broken|date=27 October 2012|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GameCity Prize ===
{{main|GameCity Prize}}
The [[GameCity Prize]] was announced on 15 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prize.gamecity.org/files/2011/09/GameCity-Prize-Press-Release-for-release-15-September-2011.pdf] {{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the annual GameCity Festival it is awarded for a game's "accomplishments and contribution to popular culture". Minecraft won the first GameCity Prize in 2011.

== National Videogame Arcade ==
In March 2015, GameCity opened the UK's first permanent cultural centre for videogames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/mar/28/national-videogame-arcade-nottingham-opens|title=Nottingham’s National Videogame Arcade gets ready for play time|date=28 March 2015|publisher=The Guardian|author1=Simon Parkin|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located in the centre of Nottingham, the National Videogame Arcade is "a place where the whole family can discover videogames, play videogames and make videogames".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamecity.org/new-ways-to-play-together] {{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spread across five floors, the NVA has three floors of playable galleries showcasing games both old and new, and exploring videogame culture through unique interactive exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/inside-britains-new-national-videogame-arcade|title=Inside Britain's National Videogame Arcade|date=27 March 2015|publisher=Motherboard|author1=Victoria Turk|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside this, the NVA further features a floor dedicated to education and the National Curriculum, allowing students a hands-on experience of game-making through a variety of workshops.

In 2016, the National Videogame Arcade in Nottingham fell into cash flow difficulties. An eleventh hour investment by a director-led consortium, led by director Iain Simons, saved all 40 jobs. The destination was being taken into administration in August 2016.

In 2018, the National Videogame Arcade moved from Nottingham to Sheffield. They are based at the Kollider building in the Castlegate area of the city.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-44643991&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2190">'''Game Developers Session''' ('''GDS''') is an annual conference on game development.
It is a regular meeting of game developers from Central Europe, especially Czech and Slovak. 

The first GDS conference was in 2003. In 2010 it was held in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official webpage|url=http://www.gdsession.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the conference gained more popularity outside the Czech Republic by presenting a set of lectures by developers from [[2K Czech]], mainly on the technical background of the game [[Mafia II]].

Before release, the developers stated that ''Absolution'' would be easier to play and more accessible, while still retaining hardcore aspects of the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dutton |first=Fred |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-05-27-hitman-absolution-to-be-more-accessible |title=Hitman: Absolution to be "more accessible" |work=Eurogamer.net |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released on 20 November 2012 (which is in the 47th week of the year in reference to the [[protagonist]], [[Agent 47]]) for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harman|first=Stace|title=Hitman: Sniper Challenge official, launching next week|url=http://www.vg247.com/2012/05/10/hitman-sniper-challenge-officially-a-thing-launching-next-week/|work=VG247}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 May 2014 ''Hitman: Absolution&amp;nbsp;— Elite Edition'' was released for [[OS X]] by [[Feral Interactive]];&lt;ref name="mac"&gt;[http://www.feralinteractive.com/en/news/422/ "Hitman: Absolution — Elite Edition for Mac now out in the field"].&lt;/ref&gt; it contained all previously released downloadable content, including ''Hitman: Sniper Challenge'', a "making of" documentary, and a 72-page artbook.&lt;ref name="mac" /&gt;

''Hitman: Absolution'' was met with a polarized reception. Most positive comments were concerning the game's graphics, environments and locations, and the varied gameplay options. However, many critics disliked the game for its linear structure as opposed to the open ended nature of previous installments. As of March 2013, the game has sold over 3.6 million copies. A sequel, ''[[Hitman (2016 video game)|Hitman]]'', was released episodically in 2016.

''Hitman: Absolution'' is a [[stealth video game]] in which the player assumes the role of a [[hitman]] named [[Agent 47]]. Presented from a [[Virtual camera system|third-person perspective]], the [[gameplay]] centers around completing set objectives within a series of [[level (video gaming)|levels]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Preview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Meltzer|first=Tom|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/nov/15/hitman-absolution-preview|title=Hitman: Absolution – preview|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=November 15, 2012|accessdate=February 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="destructoid"/&gt; Objectives can range from simply reaching the end of the level, to killing specific individuals.&lt;ref name="destructoid"/&gt; Players choose how to complete each level, taking branching paths to get to a target or location.&lt;ref name="GI ref"&gt;Martchiafava, Jeff.

==Plot==
Set after the events of ''[[Hitman: Blood Money]]'', the game begins with [[Agent 47]] ([[David Bateson]]) detailing his relationship with his handler Diana Burnwood ([[Marsha Thomason]]), whom he had trusted until she, without explanation, betrayed the International Contract Agency (ICA) by sabotaging their funding and database, using the subsequent confusion to vanish. After the ICA is reformed, 47 is tasked by his new handler, Benjamin Travis ([[Powers Boothe]]), a high level official within the ICA, to kill Diana for her betrayal and retrieve an important Agency asset, a teenage girl named Victoria ([[Isabelle Fuhrman]]), from her mansion in [[Chicago]]. 47 sneaks into the mansion and shoots Diana, but rather than finish her off, 47 comforts his dying friend and asks her why she betrayed the ICA. Diana explains that she had discovered Victoria was genetically-engineered to become an assassin for the ICA, and not wishing to see Victoria suffer the same fate as 47 she betrayed the ICA and escaped with her. As Diana's final request, 47 agrees to protect Victoria, for which Travis brands him a traitor.

After 47 drops Victoria off at the Rosewood Orphanage to hide, he contacts a disgraced Agency informant, Birdie ([[Steven Bauer]]), for information about Victoria and the ICA, which Birdie agrees to provide once 47 has assassinated a local crime boss ([[James Sie]]) in Chinatown for him. After cutting the barcode tattoo out of his head and giving his Silverballers to Birdie, 47 learns about a man named Blake Dexter ([[Keith Carradine]]), head of Dexter Industries, a home defense system company, who is staying at the Terminus Hotel and who has an interest in Victoria. 47 sneaks into the hotel and learns from a conversation between Dexter and his secretary Layla Stockton ([[Traci Lords]]) in the presidential suite that Dexter is planning to kidnap Victoria and sell her to the highest bidder. 47 tries to kill him, but is knocked out by Dexter's deformed bodyguard, Sanchez ([[Isaac C. Singleton Jr.]]). Realizing who 47 is, Dexter kills a hotel maid, frames 47, and leaves him to die after setting his suite on fire. 47 manages to escape the hotel, and is then hunted by the police. After escaping, Birdie sends him to kill Dexter's informant Dom Osmond ([[Jon Curry]]) at his strip club. Birdie then warns 47 that Dexter has hired thugs led by a mercenary named Edward Wade ([[Larry Cedar]]) to find him in order to discover Victoria's location. 47 heads to Chinatown and kills the men searching for Birdie, only to discover Birdie has already been captured, and immediately heads to the orphanage; Birdie then betrays 47 by revealing Victoria's location to Wade so that his life may be spared.

47 manages to kill Wade before he can escape with Victoria, but Lenny ([[Shane Stevens (actor)|Shane Stevens]]), Dexter's son, grabs her and leaves. Learning where to find Dexter from a matchbook found on Wade, 47 heads to the town of Hope in [[South Dakota]], where Dexter rules the town with the help of the corrupt sheriff, Clive Skurky ([[Jon Gries]]), who is under the pay of his [[private military company]]. Retrieving his Silverballers from a local gun shop, 47 takes out Lenny's gang, the "Hope Cougars", who were planning to kidnap Victoria from Dexter and sell her to a rival weapons company. After interrogating Lenny over where Victoria is, 47 is given the option to either kill Lenny or leave him to die in the desert. Arriving at Dexter Industries HQ, 47 sneaks into the company's laboratory, kills the scientists who examined Victoria, and destroys their research data on her. After killing Sanchez in an underground [[cage fight]], 47 recuperates at a hotel, but the hotel is attacked by an ICA strike team led by "The Saints", Travis's personal hit squad. 47 eliminates the Saints, including their leader, Lasandra Dixon. A furious Travis then heads to Hope with a large group of ICA operatives to kill 47 and find Victoria.

47 manages to find Victoria in the Hope Courthouse jail, but Skurky subdues him. As Dexter tortures 47, demanding to know where his son is, he is informed that Travis wants Victoria back in exchange for $10 million and leaves. 47 manages to escape into the streets of Hope, just as the ICA arrives to hunt him down. 47 pursues a wounded Skurky to a church where the sheriff tells 47 that Dexter is heading to Blackwater Park in Chicago before 47 kills him. In Chicago, Dexter and Travis attempt to exchange the money for Victoria, but the deal turns sour when Travis tries to renege on the deal and Dexter takes the money anyway. After reaching the top of Blackwater Park, 47 kills Layla and finally Dexter himself, after the latter had tried to escape with Victoria on a helicopter while ordering his men to blow up the building. Mortally wounded, Dexter laments the loss of his son and his money, leading a disgusted Victoria to throw the $10 million on his body before leaving with 47.

A few months later, Travis and his assistant Jade Nguyen arrive at a cemetery in [[England]] with an ICA crew to find Diana's grave as he suspects that Diana faked her death. 47 is there as well as he recounts the letter Diana gave to him. In the letter, Diana reveals Victoria was created by Travis's funding without the knowledge and approval of his superiors and tasks 47 with killing him. After eliminating Jade and Travis's elite bodyguards, 47 confronts Travis himself after injuring him in an explosion. As Travis rants at 47 for wasting Victoria's potential for the ICA, he asks 47 if he really did kill Diana to which 47 responds "You will never know" before shooting him.

It is later revealed that Diana did in fact fake her death and Victoria is with her at her mansion where 47 watches them from his scope thus revealing that he intentionally shot Diana in such a manner that she would survive. The game ends with a message from Diana to 47 welcoming him back to the ICA and thanking him for his help. It is also revealed that every mission undertaken by 47 from the end of ''Blood Money'' to ''Absolution'' was part of an elaborate plan by Diana to purge the ICA of internal corruption and eliminate Travis's efforts to create cloned assassins. In the epilogue, Detective Cosmo Faulkner ([[Jonathan Adams (American actor)|Jonathan Adams]]) of the [[Chicago Police Department]], who has been tracking 47 since the Terminus Hotel fire, is having trouble discovering 47's identity until Birdie offers to help him for a price.

==Development==

Though plans to continue the ''Hitman'' franchise were first announced in 2007,&lt;ref name="EIDOS3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://miranda.hemscott.com/ir/seg/pdf/AnnualReport07.pdf |title=SCiAR07 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=20 May 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6aYZmpJA9?url=http://miranda.hemscott.com/ir/seg/pdf/AnnualReport07.pdf |archive-date=5 August 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was not until May 2009 that Eidos confirmed the game was in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.incgamers.com/News/16348/Hitman5KaneLynchSequelAndMovieInTheWorks |title=Hitman 5, Kane &amp; Lynch Sequel And Movie In The Works |work=IncGamers |date= |accessdate=20 May 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/674EcoHDX?url=http://www.incgamers.com/News/16348/Hitman5KaneLynchSequelAndMovieInTheWorks |archive-date=20 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain plot details for the game were rumored in 2009, stating that the game's story would lead [[Agent 47]] to a low point from which he would have to rebuild himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=218427 |title=News: Hitman 5 out 2010 - plot details |work=ComputerAndVideoGames.com |date=29 June 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 April 2011, [[Square Enix]] filed the trademark for the name ''Hitman: Absolution'' in Europe, leading sites to speculate that it would be the name of the fifth ''Hitman'' game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/04/22/hitman-absolution-sounds-like-the-name-for-hitman-5/ |title=Hitman: Absolution Sounds Like The Name For "Hitman 5" |author=Spencer |date=22 April 2011 |work=Silicon-era |accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 May 2011, a teaser trailer was released, confirming the title ''Hitman: Absolution''.

''Hitman: Sniper Challenge'', a single [[sniper|sniping]] mission, was developed by IO Interactive, originally as a pre-order bonus, available to people who pre-order the game. The code would be supplied by retailers upon pre-order of the game, and could be collected from retailers before release as a download code before the game's release. At the time of pre-order, ''Sniper Challenge'' was redeemable via the PSN Store, Xbox Live Marketplace and PC. While the console version launched worldwide on 15 May 2012, the PC version wasn't released until 1 August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2012/05/10/hitman-sniper-challenge-officially-a-thing-launching-next-week/ |title=Hitman: Sniper Challenge official, launching next week |work=VG247 |date=11 May 2012 |accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yin |first=Wesley |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-05-10-io-confirms-hitman-sniper-challenge-with-trailer-screenshots |title=IO confirms Hitman: Sniper Challenge with trailer, screenshots |work=Eurogamer.net |date=10 May 2012 |accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hitman: Absolution'' received a generally positive reception. [[Review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]] gave the PlayStation 3 version 83/100,&lt;ref name="MCPS3" /&gt; the Xbox 360 version 79/100,&lt;ref name="MCX360" /&gt; and the PC version 79/100,&lt;ref name="MCPC" /&gt; respectively. Positive reviews came from ''[[GamesRadar+]]'', calling it "one of the strongest entries in the series to date",&lt;ref name="GR"/&gt; and ''[[Game Informer]]'', who wrote that "devising a strategy, using the environment and disguises to your advantage, and leaving before anyone knows you’re there are the hallmarks of a perfect hit, and Absolution proves Agent 47 is still gaming's premier hitman."&lt;ref name="GI" /&gt;

''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' gave it 7/10, saying "the game has taken a unique formula and diluted it".&lt;ref name="Edge"/&gt; [[VentureBeat]] gave it 7.5/10 saying "Absolution aims high but misses the mark."&lt;ref name="VB"/&gt; ''[[Eurogamer]]'' gave it 7/10 saying "Agent 47 doesn't begin Hitman: Absolution with amnesia, but the six years that have passed since we last took control of him in Blood Money do seem to have dulled his creators' recollections of what made him so popular in the first place."&lt;ref name="EG"/&gt; ''[[GameSpot]]'' gave it 7.5/10 saying "Hitman: Absolution's vivid world and enjoyable stealth-action gameplay overshadow its few notable inconsistencies."&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; [[IGN]] gave it 9/10 saying "It’s nice to have a game that doesn’t just encourage improvisation; it requires it."&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;  ''[[Kotaku]]'' gave ''Absolution'' a positive review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5961499/hitman-absolution-the-kotaku-review |title=Hitman: Absolution: The Kotaku Review |work=Kotaku.com |date=18 November 2012 |accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giant Bomb]] gave it 4/5,&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt; as did ''[[Joystiq]]''.&lt;ref name="joystiq"/&gt; ''[[Destructoid]]'' gave it 8.5/10.&lt;ref name="destructoid"/&gt; 

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' gave the game a 2/5 saying "Despite the fact that Absolution is a hugely disappointing entry into the canon, Hitman is still a fabulous series."&lt;ref name="DT"/&gt; ''[[International Business Times]]'' gave the game a 5/10 saying "An unremarkable, derivative clone of a game that's barely a shadow of what Hitman used to be."&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt; ''VideoGamer.com'' gave it 5/10 saying "The problem with Absolution is that its new custodians from the Kane and Lynch team seem to have fundamentally misunderstood what made Hitman great."&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt; ''[[PC Gamer]]'' gave it 66% saying "A passable stealth game, but one that betrays almost everything that, until now, has made Hitman great."&lt;ref name="PCG"/&gt; [[GameTrailers]] gave it 6.9/10 saying "It’s clear that a good deal of effort was put into crafting Hitman: Absolution’s world. This makes its flaws all the more unfortunate."&lt;ref name="GT"/&gt; The ''[[New Statesman]]'' gave no rating but said "If developers want to win back fans when they revisit established franchises maybe they should look to what made those games popular in the first place and by doing so maybe they’d avoid stepping on a rake or two."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hartup|first=Phil|title=Newsstateman Review|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2012/11/hitman-absolution-shows-you-cant-just-be-good-new-game-revered-old-name}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''GamerSyndrome'' gave no rating but said "Hitman: Absolution tries to be a jack of all trades but ends up being a master of none."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Finch|first=Ryan|title=Gamerssyndrome Review|url=http://gamersyndrome.com/2012/video-games/opinion-hitman-absolution-too-much-porn-not-enough-gore/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Irish Times]]'' gave no score but said "The move away from the completely open world may leave some hardcore fans of Hitman disappointed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=30 November 2012|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/game-reviews/hitman-absolution-1.559076|title=Hitman: Absolution|work=[[The Irish Times]]}} {{dead link|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' gave the game 3/5 saying "While it’s more accessible than previous Hitman games, Absolution loses a lot of the freedom that fans of the franchise love, and perhaps doesn’t necessarily fit the Hitman name any longer."&lt;ref name="TDR"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dailyrecord.co.uk |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/video-games/video-games-reviews/hitman-absolution-1450639 |title=Review: Hitman Absolution |work=Daily Record |date=23 November 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' gave no score but said "Hitman: Absolution is not the best nor the worst Hitman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hitman: Absolution |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/6586-Hitman-Absolution |title=Video Galleries : Zero Punctuation : Hitman: Absolution |work=The Escapist |date= |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian|The Guardian]]'' gave it 3/5 saying "The game may look better and play better than any Hitman game before it, but one can only marvel at how IO managed to lose sight of their IP's most appealing aspects so often."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nick Cowen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/dec/07/hitman-absolution-review-video-game |title=Hitman: Absolution&amp;nbsp;– review |department=Technology |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 December 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 March 2013, Square Enix announced that the game had sold about 3.6 million copies at retail, but has failed to reach predicted sales targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/130326slides.pdf|title=Briefing Session of Revisions to Consolidated Results Forecasts|date=26 March 2013|work=[[Square Enix]]|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical issues===
Shortly after launch, scores of complaints came in about the game crashing, freezing and corrupting file saves on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, rendering many of the games unplayable.&lt;ref name="BugWipesGameSaves"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/hitman_absolution/news/hitman_absolution_bug_wipes_game_saves.html | title=Hitman: Absolution bug wipes game saves | website=VideoGamer.com | date=22 November 2012 | accessdate=22 November 2012 | author=Scammell, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 November 2012, IO Interactive stated that they were working around the clock to try and fix these technical errors, but also stated that they did not know what exactly was causing the errors, so a patch may take some time.&lt;ref name="IOworkingaroundclock"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/hitman_absolution/news/io_working_around_the_clock_to_fix_hitman_absolutions_corrupt_save_glitch.html | title=IO working 'around the clock' to fix Hitman: Absolution's corrupt save glitch | website=VideoGamer.com | date=26 November 2012 | accessdate=26 November 2012 | author=Scammell, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The patch for the PC and PS3 versions was released on 10 December 2012,  while the Xbox 360 patch was released nine days later.

===Controversies===
On 29 May 2012, a cinematic teaser trailer, produced by Square Enix's [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] studio Visual Works, titled "Attack of the Saints" was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hitman: Absolution E3 trailer goes online|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/games/900665-hitman-absolution-e3-trailer-goes-online|department=GameCentral|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|accessdate=1 June 2012|date=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer's depiction of "gun-toting, [[Latex and PVC fetishism|PVC and latex-clad]] [[nun]]s being killed in a hail of bullets" sparked controversy over the allegedly [[sexism|sexist]] [[portrayal of women in video games|portrayal of women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silver|first=Dan|title=Why the Hitman video game trailer is a shameless piece of sexist tat designed to get the internet worked into a lather|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/hitman-why-the-video-game-trailer-is-a-shameless-855466|accessdate=6 June 2012|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KezaRant"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/05/30/opinion-what-the-hell-is-with-that-hitman-trailer | title=Opinion: What The Hell Is With That Hitman Trailer? | work=IGN | date=30 May 2012 | accessdate=6 June 2012 | author=Mac Donald, Keza}}&lt;/ref&gt; IO Interactive's Tore Blystad, the game's director, later apologized, stating they're "sorry that we offended people" and that it "was truly not the intention of the trailer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seitz|first=Dan|title=Hitman: Absolution's IO Apologizes for Nun-Shooting Trailer|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/side-mission/2012/06/07/hitman-absolutions-io-apologizes-for-nun-shooting-trailer/|work=[[GameTrailers]]|accessdate=8 June 2012|date=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2012, IO Interactive faced heavy criticism for releasing a ''Hitman: Absolution'' [[Facebook]] app that allowed users to identify and threaten Facebook friends for assassination. Methods of identifying female friends included "her hairy legs", "her muffin top" and "her small tits". Methods of identifying male friends included "his ginger hair", "his shit hair" and "his tiny penis". Users could choose a reason to kill their friend, such as the fact that they "smell bad" or were cheating on their partner. Friends received a personalised video on their Facebook wall identifying them as a target. Signing up to watch the video presented recipients with a mixture of their own photos and Facebook details merged into a video of ''Hitman'' character Agent 47 shooting them. IO Interactive admitted the promotional app was in bad taste and removed it the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Tom|title=Devs slam Hitman: Absolution promotion that invited you to identify female Facebook friends by their "small tits" and then kill them|work=Eurogamer|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-12-04-gamers-devs-slam-hitman-absolution-promotion-that-invites-you-to-identify-female-facebook-friends-by-their-small-tits-and-then-kill-them}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Joscelyne|first=Svend|title='Bullying' Hitman: Absolution Facebook App Pulled|url=http://spong.com/article/28560/Bullying-Hitman-Absolution-Facebook-App-Pulled}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Honorof|first=Marshall|title=Threaten your friends with Hitman Absolution app|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/120921-Update-Threaten-Your-Friends-With-Hitman-Facebook-App}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6322">'''Hole carding''' refers to obtaining knowledge of cards that are supposed to be hidden from view in card games. The term is usually applied to [[blackjack]] but can apply to other games with hidden hole cards, like [[three card poker]] and [[Caribbean stud poker]]. So long as it does not involve the use of a device like a mirror or actions like touching the dealer's cards, in most jurisdictions hole carding is a legal form of [[advantage gambling]] in casino table games. In other games, like [[stud poker]], casinos normally have rules against rubbernecking or having a confederate stand behind an opponent to signal hole cards.

Blackjack players must usually make playing decisions based on only seeing one of the dealer's cards (the upcard). But if the dealer's hole card is spotted, a player who plays correctly has a theoretical advantage of up to 13% instead of the normal player disadvantage of around 0.5%. A hole-card player will often choose not to make certain plays, such as hitting a hard 19 against a dealer 20, so as not to reveal that he can see the dealer's hole card.

This technique is not applicable in most games outside of the United States where the second dealer card is normally not dealt until all players have played.

==Hole card strategies==

A normal blackjack strategy has ten columns, for an ace through dealer ten value card. Strategy tables for hole carding differ from normal blackjack tables as they include a column for each possible total dealer hand instead of simply the visible card. Below is a sample hole card hit/stand table for six decks, stand on soft-17. The columns are based on the dealer hand and the rows based on the player hand. Green denotes a hit.

[[File:Blackjack_Hit-Stand_holecarding_strategy_table.png||center]]

==First-basing and spooking==
One method of hole carding is to peek at the card when the dealer checks the hole card for blackjack. This is called "first-basing". A modification called "spooking" refers to a partner with a better view peeking at the hole card in the same circumstance and communicating the information to the player. Peeking devices have made these methods largely obsolete.

==Front-loading==
Front-loading refers to observing the hole card as it is slid under the upcard.&lt;ref&gt;Uston, Ken ''Million Dollar Blackjack''. Sept. 1, 1992, Carol Publishing Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; Newer methods of hole-carding concentrate on observation before the down card is placed under the upcard. This provides information about the card even if the dealer upcard is not a ten or an ace. The advantage varies depending on the rules, the percentage of cards seen, and the strategies used.

==Partial information==
At times the player will see a corner of the hole card, but not enough to determine the exact card. For example, if there is no pip in the corner, the card may be an ace, 2 or 3. Or, if there is a pip in the corner, it is a 4-10, but not a face card. To make use of this additional information, a different set of strategy tables must be used depending on the set of possible cards in the hole.

Below is a sample blackjack, partial hole card hit/stand table for two decks. The columns are based on the dealer upcard and the rows based on the player hand. Partial hole card tables contain ten columns as you do not know the dealer total hand for certain. A different set of tables must be used depending on the information about the hole card. In this table, the hole card is a six or seven. Green denotes a hit. You will note that this table bears little resemblance to a standard blackjack strategy.

== Next card play ==
Hole carding generally refers to knowing the dealer’s hole card. Next card play refers to knowing the next card to be dealt. If a round has not started, and you know what your first card will be, you can simply alter your bet depending on the value of that card. In a game like blackjack, if the dealer has already dealt your first two cards, and you know the next card to be dealt, you can alter your playing decisions to include this additional information. Strategies are significantly more complex as there exist a different set of strategy tables for each possible next card. They also differ depending on your seat and the rules as follows:
* First Seat – If you do not take the known card, another player gets it. 
* Last Seat – If you do not take the card, the dealer may draw it. This does not necessarily mean that you are sitting at third base. It may be that all players to your left are unlikely to draw a card.
* No hole card – In a no-hole-card game, if you do not take the card, it may become the dealer’s second card.

==Other methods==

* Warped cards – In a casino where a blackjack dealer bends the hole card to check for a blackjack, the cards can become warped. The warps can be later used to determine the value of a face down card. This method is largely obsolete as most casinos use devices instead of bending cards to determine dealer blackjacks, and cards are regularly replaced with new decks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blaine|first1=Rick|title=Blackjack Blueprint: How to Play Like a Pro . . . Part-Time|date=May 1, 2014|publisher=Huntington Press|isbn=1935396536|page=169|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dealer tells – When a blackjack dealer checks for a blackjack, some dealers may give clues as to the value of the down card, akin to Poker tells. Again, most casinos now use devices to check the down card, rendering this obsolete in most casinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=Arnold|title=Blackbelt in blackjack : playing 21 as a martial art|date=2005|publisher=Cardoza Pub.|location=New York|isbn=978-1580421430|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Peeking at other players' cards – Depending on the game and casino, this may or may not be acceptable and may aid player decisions.
* Counting by inference – In blackjack where player cards are dealt face down, the actions of other players can provide clues as to their hidden cards. This is less valuable in modern casinos due to the fewer number of single-deck games and reduction in penetration (how deeply the dealer deals before shuffling.)

'''''Hot Shot Hamish''''' and '''''Mighty Mouse''''' were two popular [[United Kingdom|British]] [[association football|football]]-themed comic strips, which later merged, and which appeared in various publications from the 1970s to the 1990s. Both are amongst the best remembered football characters from the "golden age" of British boys' comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1093419,00.html|title=The 10 best comic book footballers|last=Honeyball|first=Lee|date=2003-11-30|accessdate=2007-01-19|location=London|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both strips were written by Fred Baker (died 2008)&lt;ref&gt;http://downthetubes.net/?p=14025&lt;/ref&gt; and usually drawn by [[Julio Schiaffino]] (born 1936, died 23 June 2016)&lt;ref&gt;https://luisalberto941.wordpress.com/2016/06/25/murio-julio-schiaffino-protagonista-de-la-mejor-epoca-de-hora-cero-y-frontera/ (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mighty Mouse'' first appeared in the ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'' comic in June 1979, and featured Kevin "Mighty" Mouse. Mouse was a successful and highly skillful [[Football League Division One|First Division]] footballer despite the fact that he was very short, extremely overweight, and wore thick spectacles even while playing. He also managed to divide his time between playing for Tottenford Rovers and studying at St Victor's Hospital as a medical student. At the hospital he lived in fear of ferocious matron "Mad Annie", and his superior was the cantankerous Dr Mender, who also ran the hospital football team, for which Mouse played. As he was also a professional player, while all his teammates were amateurs, he was vastly more skillful than anyone else on the team.

''Hot Shot Hamish'', meanwhile, followed gentle [[Hebrides|Hebridean]] giant Hamish Balfour, the man with the most powerful shot in the world, and began its days in ''[[Scorcher (magazine)|Scorcher]]'' in August 1973, before relocating to ''[[Tiger (comic)|Tiger]]'' when the two titles merged. Hamish was brought from his remote island home to play for Princes Park in the [[Scottish Premier League|Scottish Premier Division]], under manager Ian McWhacker, and was famous for being able to hit the ball so hard that his shot could (and often did) burst the goalnet. His powerful frame was emphasised by the fact that he always played in a shirt which was far too small for him and which did not reach the waistband of his shorts. Hamish's regular supporting characters were his eccentric father and his pet sheep McMutton.

In 1985, after the cancellation of ''Tiger'', most of its strips moved to ''Eagle'', but Hamish was re-located to ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'' and the two strips merged to form ''Hot Shot Hamish and Mighty Mouse'' (later shortened to simply ''Hamish and Mouse''). The first episode of the combined strip appeared in the ''Roy of the Rovers'' comic dated 6 April 1985. In the storyline, Mouse was deemed surplus to requirements at Tottenford Rovers after the signing of a more skillful player who played in the same position. On a trip to watch [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] playing, he met up with Hamish, who persuaded him to sign for Princes Park (conveniently Mouse was also able to transfer to a Scottish hospital to continue his studies). In later years, the pair transferred to Glengow Rangers where they were later joined by McWhacker (who promptly signed a number of their former Princes Park teammates).

The strip ran until May 1990, returned in July of the same year, and finally came to an end in January 1993, with reprints appearing in the remaining issues of the weekly Roy of the Rovers comic.

A rarity among the genre of football strips, the Hamish and Mouse story was extremely humorous in nature, with unbelievable and exaggerated tricks and skills shown by the two lead characters, although they never degenerated into out and out pastiche in the style of [[Billy the Fish]]. Many characters had humorous names, for example the manager of the Scottish national team was called Mr McBossy. Storylines were often comical and highly far-fetched - one notable example saw Mr McWhacker attempt to intimidate the Princes Park players into playing better by secretly disguising himself as a monster called "The Claw" and haunting the club corridors, bursting out and warning startled players that they would be devoured if they did not win matches.

Their adventures were also published in other European countries. In France they were known as ''Hamish La Foudre'' and ''Mousie L'Eclair'', in Sweden as ''Super-Mac'' (Hamish) and ''Bullen'' (Mouse), and in Finland as ''Super-Mac'' and ''Pulla''.

Hamish was mentioned as {{convert|6|ft|10|in|m|abbr=off}} tall with size 16 boots.

He was selected to play for Scotland making him Princes Park's first international player. During the match, his hot shot was saved by the opposing goalkeeper who actually caught it in his hands! His first goal was disallowed after a teammate fouled the keeper before he headed it in, but his father went into a rage at the referee and was dragged off by the police. Hamish had possession again giving a much harder hot shot than the first saying "Try this for size!". This time he scored, burst the net, hit the floodlight post causing the floodlights to collapse onto the pitch. The match was abandoned as a result.

'''Club Career'''

In the early 70s Princes Park F.C. were the cinderella of Scottish Football. Overshadowed by the great sides of Glasgow Princes Park languished at the foot of the Second division of the Scottish League but manager Ian McWhacker was determined the 1973-1974 season should see a vast improvement. This happened when the Princes Park team visited the Hebrides discovering Hamish Balfour, a boy with a figure of a giant and the most powerful shot in the world. Ian McWhacker said that Hamish could be the signing of the century!&lt;br /&gt;
Hamish soon became supporters favorite but after a fall-out with the directors he was placed on the transfer list. Crawford Town, an English club of the first division where the first to sign the new talent, with young Balfour debuting for them in a World Cup warm-up match against a South American team in London. But Princes Park's supporters demonstrated for his return which was realized shortly after and Hamish gave them a massive compensation: Princes Park won the Scottish Cup for the very first time of its history in 1974 after  beating Ratch Rovers at Hampden Park.&lt;br /&gt;
Within 6 years (1974-1980) thanks to Balfour's fireballs Princes Park would enjoy promotion to the Premier division, suffer relegation and promotion again. The 1979-80 found Princes Park back to the first division. Hamish Balfour would give the Cup to Princes Park for the second time in 1982, promotion to the top flight again and two years later he would stand on the high pedestal of Scottish Football, the Premier Division title. The Hebridian giant having already debuted for the Scotland national team won his second cap in a match against Iceland in March 1985 under manager Ian McBossy. A distinguished career with Scotland wasn't meant to be but that was when he met Kevin Mouse who attended the match in Glasgow. The summer of the same year he helped Pongi FC win agame in Kenyan League while holidaying in Kenya with teammate Wee Wally.&lt;br /&gt;
Ian McWhacker had managed to build a strong team with the likes of Hamish Balfour, Kevin Mouse and Wee Wally. The all-conquering trio helped Princes Park be crowned Cup winners in 1987 and reached the top of Europe the following year by beating Bumchen Munchen in the European Cup Winners' Cup Final. One year later McWhacker signed Mouse and Balfour for his new team Glengow Rangers.&lt;br /&gt;
Scottish Cup winner again in 1990 and European season for Hamish Balfour but his career in Rangers never became as glamorous as it had been in Princes Park for 16 years. On 30 January 1993 after a horrible defeat in Scottish Cup, manager McWhacker quit leaving Balfour and Mouse in doubt over their future in Glengow Rangers.

'''Club career'''&lt;br /&gt;
Kevin 'Mighty' Mouse started his career playing part-time for non-league Alftown Hotcakes, where Mouse scored a solitary winning goal in a 1-0 win in the FA Cup 3rd round against League Champions Nottingpool United. Soon after he signed for Tottenford Rovers while studying at St Victor's Hospital, where he was a medical student with a dream to be a distinguished doctor. He played in UEFA Cup with Tottenford Rovers but in 1985 he moved up north to Glasgow teaming up with the gentle giant Hamish Balfour for the sake of Princes Park. He became part of the dynamic trio (Hamish-Mouse-Wee Wally) which sent Princes Park to the seventh heaven when they conquered the Cup Winners' Cup, the greatest accomplishment in the club's history. The final ended in 3-2 score in the favour of Park and Kevin Mouse played a key-role in this tremendous victory scoring one goal.&lt;br /&gt;
He would follow Balfour and manager Ian McWhacker to Glengow Rangers five years later helping the ''Gers'' win the Scottish Cup.

'''Managerial Career'''&lt;br /&gt;
Mighty Mouse was installed as the new [[Melchester Rovers]] manager in 2018 as seen in the new [[Roy of the Rovers]] strip in [[Match of the Day]] magazine.

'''''InQuest Gamer''''' was a monthly magazine for game reviews and news that was published from 1995 to 2007. Originally, the magazine was named '''''InQuest''''' and focused solely on [[collectible card game]]s (CCGs); ''InQuest'', along with its competitor ''[[Scrye]]'', were the two major CCG magazines. Later, the magazine changed its focus to cover a wider range of games, including [[role-playing game]]s, [[computer game|computer]] and [[video game]]s, [[collectible miniature game]]s, [[board game]]s, and others. The magazine was published by [[Wizard Entertainment]] (not to be confused with [[Wizards of the Coast]], which produced its own CCG magazine, ''[[The Duelist]]'').

==History and profile==
''InQuest'' #0, the first issue, was published in April 1995.  For issue #46 (February 1999), ''InQuest'' changed its name to ''InQuest Gamer'' (with ''[[Gamer]]'' in large text on the cover), clearly announcing that it was a magazine about games. Issue #53 made the ''InQuest'' title more prominent on the cover again and it had not been changed since then, though the cover's format was revamped with issue #122.

Typical content included news, strategy articles, a price guide for collectible card and miniature games, reference lists, and game-related entertainment and humor. Issues with special cards were mailed in plastic bags, issues without special cards were typically sold at retail stores and game shows without any special covering.

The magazine's editorial staff included Mike Searle, Tom Slizewski, Jeff Hannes, Brent Fishbaugh, Steve Frohnhoefer, Paul Sudlow, Jeremy Smith, Thorin McGee, Kyle Ackerman, Alex Shvartsman and [[Rick Swan]].  Martin A. Stever was responsible for the magazine's sales and marketing.

Because it was first published about two years after the release of ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', the trading card game was one of ''InQuest's'' main topics. ''InQuest'' was frequently home to fictional cards, including "purple" cards featured in issue #22 (February 1997).&lt;ref name="IQ Purple Cards"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.magiclibrary.net/rarities-inquest-the-sixth-color.html |title = Magic Rarities: The Sixth Color Cards |accessdate = 2007-09-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070910235430/http://www.magiclibrary.net/rarities-inquest-the-sixth-color.html |archivedate = 2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hypothetical cards, which used a new "Portal" land to create purple mana, led some to think that the then-upcoming [[Portal (Magic: The Gathering)|Portal]] set would introduce a sixth color.&lt;ref name="IQ Purple Confusion"&gt;{{cite mailing list |url = http://oracle.wizards.com/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind9701c&amp;L=mtg-l&amp;D=1&amp;P=15433 |title=Re: MTG-L Digest - 16 Jan 1997 to 17 Jan 1997 |date=1997-01-18 |accessdate=2007-09-23 |mailinglist=MTG-L@ORACLE.WIZARDS.COM |last=Johnson |first=Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''intercarrier method''' is a system in television that reduces the cost of transmitters and receiver sets by processing audio and video signals together and minimizing the number of separate stages for audio and video signals.

== Transmission of audio and video signals ==
In [[Television program|television]], unlike monophonic radio, at least two signals should be transmitted; [[audio signal|audio]] (AF) and [[video signal|video]] (VF) signals.

Transmitting those signals by means of separate [[transmitters]] and [[Antenna (radio)|antenna systems]] is a very costly solution. Because every stage must be used twice, one for AF and one for VF. Two separate transmitters, a high power combiner and a common antenna system, known as [[split sound system]], is also quite costly. But if the signals are combined at an earlier stage, number of costly outer stages is reduced.

The same logic also applies to [[television receiver|receiver]] sets. If the modulated signal is separated just before the [[Cathode ray tube|picture tube]] the number of separate stages for AF and VF is minimum.

This common signal processing system is known as intercarrier system.

== Intercarrier as used in TV transmitters ==
{{main|Television transmitter}}

In TV transmitters, both AF and VF [[modulation|modulate]] [[intermediate frequency]] (IF) carriers. (The frequency difference between the two carriers is 4.5&amp;nbsp;MHz in [[CCIR System M|System M]] and 5.5&amp;nbsp;MHz in [[CCIR System B|System B/G]]) Then the modulated IF signals are added either at the output of the [[Modulator|vision modulator]] or at the output of the vestigial sideband stage. In both cases, the added signals are low level signals and no special combining circuitry is required.

[[Frequency mixer|Frequency conversion]] and [[Amplifier|amplification]] is common. So a [[Electronic mixer|frequency converter]] (or a mixer) and a series of amplifiers for aural signal as well as an output [[combiner]] are spared, which reduce the cost of the transmitter and electricity consumption of the amplifiers considerably. Although a [[Band-stop filter|notch filter]] to suppress the intermodulation products  is used at the output of the intercarrier transmitter, the cost of the notch filter is not comparable to the cost of extra amplifiers and the output combiner. (See the subsection '''Intermodulation products''' below)

== Intercarrier as used in receiver sets ==

{{main|Television set}}

In TV receivers, the received radio frequency signal is converted to IF in tuner and then demodulated. The output of the demodulator consists of  a VF and an aural signal which is in fact an FM subcarrier modulated by AF. (The subcarrier is 5.5&amp;nbsp;MHz in system B and 4.5&amp;nbsp;MHz in system M ) The aural signal and the VF are separated by a simple filter.  The only extra stage needed for AF  (other than the [[loudspeaker]]) is an [[Demodulation|FM demodulator]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Grob,Charles E.Herndon:''Basic Television and Video Systems'', Glencoe, McGraw Hill, New York, 6th ed, 1999, p 469.&lt;/ref&gt;  The intercarrier receiver system makes for easier tuning of a TV station.  The viewer could fine tune such a set to get the best picture reception, and not lose sound reception. (Although AF VF signals are combined in the IF stages of the transmitters, they are separated in baseband stages of the receivers.)

== Intermodulation products and notch filters==
{{main|Intermodulation}}

When VF and the aural signal  modulate the same carrier the  inevitable non-linearity of the electronic circuits cause unwanted signals which are called intermodulation products. The unwanted signals appear on [[RF spectrum]] at regular intervals, the interval being equal to the frequency difference of the visual and aural carriers.

In TV broadcasting the intermodulation products of the aural subcarrier and the main carrier appear out of the  [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|RF band]] of the [[TV channel]]. However, out of band product means an unwanted transmission in the neighbour TV channels. For example, intermodulation products of channel 7 appear in channel 5,6, 8 and 9. That is why notch filters are used in intercarrier system.

The '''Inverse Cost and Quality Law''' attempts to formalize any [[Hollywood]] cinema production characterized by a large budget and, by negative [[correlation]], poorly perceived critical attributes. The American writer, [[David Foster Wallace]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davidfosterwallace.com/bio.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=David Foster Wallace Found Dead|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/13/david-foster-wallace-dies_n_126238.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=09/13/08}}&lt;/ref&gt; coined the term and established the genre’s attributes, symptoms or diagnostic features in a 1998 article titled, "F/X Porn"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.badgerinternet.com/~bobkat/waterstone.html&lt;/ref&gt; by which Wallace primarily critiques the weaknesses of ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; film directed by [[James Cameron]].

== Overview ==

[[David Foster Wallace]], in a 1998 essay which first appeared in Waterstone's Magazine and was later anthologized in the essay collection ''[[Both Flesh and Not]]'', posited that ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' was the archetype or apotheosis of the Inverse Cost and Quality Law:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foster Wallace|first=David|title=F/X Porn|url=http://www.znaksagite.com/diskusije/index.php/topic,3911.msg155680.html#msg155680|publisher=Waterstone's Magazine|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="F/X"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster Wallace|first=David|title=Both Flesh and Not|date=November 6, 2012|publisher=Little Brown &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0316182379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"'T2' is thus also the first and best instance of a paradoxical law that appears to hold true for the entire F/X Porn genre. It is called the Inverse Cost and Quality Law, and it states very simply that the larger a movie's budget is, the shittier that movie is going to be. The case of "T2" shows that much of the ICQL's force derives from simple financial logic. A film that would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make is going to get financial backing if and only if its investors can be maximally -- _maximally_ -- sure that at the very least they will get their hundreds of millions of dollars back [11] -- i.e. a megabudget movie must not fail (and "failure" here means anything less than a runaway box-office hit) and must thus adhere to certain reliable formulae that have been shown by precedent to maximally ensure a runaway hit."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the dislike by Wallace, ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' is critically acclaimed. It won four [[Academy Awards]], and review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports 92% positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/terminator_2_judgment_day |title=Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[hip hop]] group [[Beastie Boys]] recorded many songs during their career. Between 1982 and 2012, the group [[Beastie Boys discography|released]] eight [[studio album]]s, four [[compilation album]]s, seven [[extended play]]s, and forty [[Single (music)|singles]]. Beginning in 1981 as a four-piece [[hardcore punk]] group, Beastie Boys consisted of [[Mike D|Michael "Mike D" Diamond]], [[Adam Yauch|Adam "MCA" Yauch]], [[Kate Schellenbach]], and John Berry.{{sfn|Zwickel|2011|p=14}} In 1982, after the release of the EP, ''[[Polly Wog Stew]]'', Berry left the group and was replaced by [[Ad-Rock|Adam "Ad-Rock" Horovitz]].{{sfn|Zwickel|2011|pp=15, 16}} A year later, the group released their debut single, "[[Cooky Puss]]", which marked a change in style to a more [[hip-hop]] oriented sound.&lt;ref name="nymag"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barshad |first1=Amos |title=Rude Boys |url=http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/beastie-boys-2011-5/ |website=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=October 22, 2017 |pages=2 |date=April 24, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301015036/http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/beastie-boys-2011-5/ |archivedate=March 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The single garnered the attention of New York University student [[Rick Rubin]], who, in 1984, would form [[Def Jam Recordings]] with [[Russell Simmons]] and ask Beastie Boys to join his label.{{sfn|Zwickel|2011|pp=18, 19}} Afterwards, Schellenbach left the group and the remaining three, Ad-Rock, Mike D, and MCA, decided to focus their attention on [[Rapping|rap]].{{sfn|Zwickel|2011|pp=18, 19}}

With Rubin's assistance on writing and producing, Beastie Boys released the singles "[[Rock Hard]]" in 1984 and "[[She's on It]]" in 1985, before releasing their debut studio album, ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'', in November 1986.&lt;ref name="allmusic bio"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|authorlink1=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Beastie Boys – Biography|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/beastie-boys-mn0000038469/biography|website=''[[AllMusic]]''|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was a huge commercial success, and received critical acclaim.&lt;ref name="rs bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beastie Boys Bio|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/beastie-boys/biography|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|authorlink1=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=''Licensed to Ill'' – Beastie Boys|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/licensed-to-ill-mw0000649870|website=''[[AllMusic]]''|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to financial disagreements, Beastie Boys broke away from Def Jam and signed with [[Capitol Records]] in California.

'''''Max &amp; the Magic Marker''''' is a [[platformer]] [[video game]] released for [[WiiWare]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[Macintosh]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[iOS]], [[Windows Phone 7]], and [[Windows Phone 8]]. It is developed by [[Press Play (company)|Press Play]].

The [[protagonist]] is a boy named Max, who draws a monster with a special [[magic marker]] that he happened to come across. The monster comes to life, invades Max's drawings and begins wreaking havoc in them. Max must chase and get rid of the monster, with the help of the magic marker.

==Gameplay==

''Max &amp; the Magic Marker'' is a [[platform game]] with gameplay elements similar to ''[[Crayon Physics]]'' where the magic marker is controlled by the mouse and is used to create physics objects such as platforms and boxes to assist Max in his adventure. The Magic Marker is used by the player to create bridges, platforms and heavy objects to help Max cross caverns, rise up on moving objects, or be propelled in the air via a see-saw.

'''''McAlpine v Bercow''''' was a landmark legal case in 2013 between Conservative peer [[Alistair McAlpine, Baron McAlpine of West Green|Lord McAlpine]] and [[Sally Bercow]], the wife of [[John Bercow]], [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].

==Background==
Lord McAlpine alleged that he was defamed by comments implying that he was a [[pedophile|paedophile]] published by Sally Bercow on [[Twitter]], a [[social networking service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.braintreeandwithamtimes.co.uk/uk_national_news/10422917.Bercow_in_court_for_McAlpine_case/|title=Bercow in court for McAlpine case|date=16 May 2013|accessdate=21 May 2013|work=Braintree &amp; Witham Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed the broadcast on 2 November 2012 of a report by [[BBC Two]]'s ''[[Newsnight]]'' which falsely linked an unnamed "senior Conservative" politician to sex abuse claims.&lt;ref name="greenslade"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Twitter users should learn lessons from Sally Bercow's libellous tweet|first=Roy|last=Greenslade|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 May 2013|accessdate=26 May 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/may/24/twitter-medialaw?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|authorlink=Roy Greenslade}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Lord McAlpine's solicitor says Sally Bercow 'acted dishonourably'|date=24 May 2013|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22660274|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November 2012, Bercow tweeted "Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent face*"&lt;ref name="dowell"&gt;{{Cite news|title=McAlpine libel: 20 tweeters including Sally Bercow pursued for damages|first=Ben|last=Dowell|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 November 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/nov/23/mcalpine-libel-bercow-monbiot-davies|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sherwin"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Twitter libel: Sally Bercow says she has 'learned the hard way' as she settles with Tory peer Lord McAlpine over libellous tweet|first=Adam|last=Sherwin|date=24 May 2013|work=[[The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/twitter-libel-sally-bercow-says-she-has-learned-the-hard-way-as-she-settles-with-tory-peer-lord-mcalpine-over-libellous-tweet-8630653.html|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the allegations against McAlpine proved to be unfounded, Bercow was one of a number of people that the peer threatened with legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9680645/Lord-McAlpine-threatens-to-sue-Speakers-wife-Sally-Bercow.html|title=Lord McAlpine threatens to sue Speaker's wife Sally Bercow|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=20 November 2012|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Hannah|last=Furness}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC subsequently apologised and paid £185,000 to McAlpine in damages and the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] television network paid him £125,000 in damages. McAlpine commenced legal actions against users of Twitter who had repeated the claims but users with fewer than 500 followers were allowed to settle the matter by making a donation of £25 to the ''[[Children in Need |BBC Children in Need]]'' charity.&lt;ref name=greenslade/&gt;&lt;ref name="halliday"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Lord McAlpine drops some Twitter defamation cases|first=Josh |last=Halliday|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 February 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/21/lord-mcalpine-twitter-defamation-cases|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Lord McAlpine tells Twitter users he does not intend to 'create hardship' as he pursues them for damages|first=Gordon |last=Rayner|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=21 November 2012|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/9694209/Lord-McAlpine-tells-Twitter-users-he-does-not-intend-to-create-hardship-as-he-pursues-them-for-damages.html|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; McAlpine donated the libel damages from BBC and ITV to ''Children in Need'' and other charities.&lt;ref name="cheston"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Humiliation for Sally Bercow as Speaker's wife faces £150,000 bill over Lord McAlpine libel tweet|first=Paul|last=Cheston|work=[[Evening Standard]]|date=24 May 2013|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/humiliation-for-sally-bercow-as-speakers-wife-faces-150000-bill-over-lord-mcalpine-libel-tweet-8630311.html|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McAlpine's lawyers said that they would continue to pursue 20 "high profile Tweeters" (users with more than 500 followers) including Bercow, comedian [[Alan Davies]] and writer [[George Monbiot]].&lt;ref name=dowell/&gt; Acting on behalf of McAlpine, solicitor Andrew Reid announced: "Twitter is not just a closed coffee shop among friends. It goes out to hundreds of thousands of people and you must take responsibility for it. It is not a place where you can gossip and say things with impunity, and we are about to demonstrate that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Peer to sue tweeters who linked him to sex abuse as BBC pays £185,000 damages|first1=Steven |last1=Swinford |first2=Gordon |last2=Rayner |date=15 November 2012 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=26 May 2013|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9681881/Lord-McAlpine-to-sue-tweeters-who-linked-him-to-sex-abuse-as-BBC-pays-185000-damages.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2012, Monbiot published ''"Lord McAlpine – An Abject Apology"'' on his personal website and apologised for acting "in an unprofessional, thoughtless and cruel manner." Monbiot also wrote personally to McAlpine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lord McAlpine – An Abject Apology|date=10 November 2012|first=George|last=Monbiot|authorlink=George Monbiot|work=monbiot.com|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2012/11/10/lord-mcalpine-an-abject-apology/|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Lord McAlpine: Guardian will not pay George Monbiot's legal costs|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Hannah|last=Furness|date=16 November 2012|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9683457/Lord-McAlpine-Guardian-will-not-pay-George-Monbiots-legal-costs.html|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and agreed to undertake charity work.&lt;ref name=sherwin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Lord McAlpine row: George Monbiot reaches 'unprecedented' settlement|first=Josh |last=Halliday|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 March 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/mar/12/george-monbiot-libel-lord-mcalpine|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davies apologised publicly and privately to McAlpine in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Alan Davies apologises over Lord McAlpine tweet|first=Andrew |last=Hough |date=19 November 2012|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9689098/Alan-Davies-apologises-over-Lord-McAlpine-tweet.html|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Bercow "consistently denied that her tweets were libellous" and in December 2012 she appointed the law firm [[Carter-Ruck]] to defend her against the claim.&lt;ref name=halliday/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sally Bercow Sued By Lord McAlpine For £50k|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1025227/sally-bercow-sued-by-lord-mcalpine-for-50k|date=13 December 2012|work=[[Sky News]]|accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halliday|first=Josh|title=Sally Bercow faces Lord McAlpine high court battle|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/13/sally-bercow-lord-mcalpine|accessdate=23 December 2012|date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sally Bercow denies 'trivialising' public apology to Lord McAlpine|first=Josh |last=Halliday|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=4 March 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/mar/04/sally-bercow-apology-lord-mcalpine|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that the tweet was made she had 56,000 followers, described by [[Edward Garnier|Sir Edward Garnier]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], for McAlpine, as "a bigger readership than many regional newspapers."&lt;ref name=sherwin/&gt;&lt;ref name="stages"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Lord McAlpine wins first round in hearing for Twitter libel case|first=Josh |last=Halliday|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 April 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/16/lord-mcalpine-libel-sally-bercow|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
At a preliminary hearing held on 16 April 2013 it was decided that the trial should be split into two stages. The first stage would decide if the words of the tweet could be considered defamatory. If this was found to be the case a second hearing would be held to determine the level of damages unless both parties were able to reach an agreement.&lt;ref name=stages/&gt;

The judgment in the first stage was handed down on 24 May 2013. [[Michael Tugendhat|The Hon. Mr Justice Tugendhat]] was asked to rule on the meaning of Bercow's tweet, particularly the phrase "innocent face" which the judge said was intended to be read "as a stage direction" with readers "imagining that they can see [Bercow's] face as she asks the question in the Tweet. The words direct the reader to imagine that the expression on her face is one of innocence, that is an expression which purports to indicate (sincerely, on the Defendant's case, but insincerely or ironically on the Claimant's case) that she does not know the answer to her question."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=McAlpine-Bercow Judgment|work=judiciary.gov.uk|date=24 May 2013|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/mcalpine-bercow-judgment-24052013.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2013|id=¶ 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rozenberg"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sally Bercow learns the social media rules the hard way in McAlpine case|first=Joshua |last=Rozenberg

The judge said that there were two different kinds of meaning recognised in law: "a natural and ordinary meaning" and "an innuendo meaning." Citing ''Jones v Skelton'',&lt;ref&gt;[1963] 1 WLR 1362&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Justice Tugendhat explained that a natural and ordinary meaning may be either the literal meaning or a meaning "that does not require the support of extrinsic facts passing beyond general knowledge." An innuendo meaning, he said, "is a meaning which can be implied from the words complained of, but only if the reader also knows other facts (which are not general knowledge). These are generally called extrinsic facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=McAlpine-Bercow Judgment|work=judiciary.gov.uk|date=24 May 2013|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/JCO/Documents/Judgments/mcalpine-bercow-judgment-24052013.pdf|accessdate=14 November 2014|id=¶ 47-54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge decided that any ''reasonable'' reader would understand both meanings of Bercow's tweet and interpret the "innocent face" as insincere and ironical: "There is no sensible reason for including those words in the tweet if they are to be taken as meaning that the defendant simply wants to know the answer to a factual question."&lt;ref name=rozenberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=McAlpine-Bercow Judgment|work=judiciary.gov.uk|date=24 May 2013|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/mcalpine-bercow-judgment-24052013.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2013|id=¶ 84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge decided that the Tweet meant "in its natural and ordinary defamatory meaning, that the Claimant was a paedophile who was guilty of sexually abusing boys living in care."&lt;ref name="para88"&gt;{{Cite web|title=McAlpine-Bercow Judgment|work=judiciary.gov.uk|date=24 May 2013|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/mcalpine-bercow-judgment-24052013.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2013|id=¶ 88-91}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the innuendo of the tweet Mr Justice Tugendhat found that the Tweet carried a meaning "to the same effect" and found that the tweet was "an allegation of guilt. I see no room on these facts for any less serious meaning."&lt;ref name=para88/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sally Bercow tweet libelled Lord McAlpine, high court rules|first=Josh |last=Halliday |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 May 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/24/sally-bercow-tweet-libelled-lord-mcalpine|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it had already been accepted by Bercow prior to the hearing that McAlpine was innocent of the allegations her tweet was "seriously defamatory" and indefensible in law.&lt;ref name=rozenberg/&gt;

Following judgment both parties reached an agreement and Bercow agreed to pay damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-22652083 |title=High Court: Sally Bercow's Lord McAlpine tweet was libel |work=[[BBC News]] |date=24 May 2013|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bercow was also ordered to apologise in open court to McAlpine, who said that he would travel to London from his home in Italy "to hear it personally".&lt;ref name=cheston/&gt;

Prior to judgment Bercow made two offers to settle out of court. Both were rejected by McAlpine, leading to [[Joshua Rozenberg]], a lawyer and columnist for London's ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper, to opine "that the undisclosed, agreed damages were higher than she had hoped."&lt;ref name=rozenberg/&gt; McAlpine's solicitor Andrew Reid said: "The apologies previously received from Mrs Bercow did not concede that her tweet was defamatory but clearly she must now accept this fact. Her failure to admit that her tweet was defamatory caused considerable unnecessary pain and suffering to Lord McAlpine and his family over the last six months. The judgment is one of great public interest and provides both a warning to and guidance for people who use social media." Rozenberg noted: "The law of defamation is well known to those who write for a living. One hopes Twitter users are beginning to learn what a powerful and potentially dangerous weapon they have at their fingertips. A tweet is more like a broadcast than an email and is subject to the law of libel in the same way."&lt;ref name=rozenberg/&gt; 

Bercow said: "The High Court found that my tweet constituted a serious libel, both in its natural meaning and as an innuendo. To say I am surprised and disappointed by this is an understatement. I will accept the ruling as the end of the matter. I remain sorry for the distress I have caused Lord McAlpine and I repeat my apologies. Today's ruling should be seen as a warning to all social media users."&lt;ref name=sherwin/&gt;

Patrick Strudwick, also writing in ''The Guardian'', noted that on the day of the hearing many Twitter users tweeted: ''"Why is Sally Bercow trending? *libel face*"'', a humorous reference to her defamatory tweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sally Bercow's Lord McAlpine libel: Twitter is over.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38982">'''Body shape''' refers to the many physical attributes of the [[human body]] that make up its appearance, including size and countenance. [[Body shape]] has come to imply not only sexual/reproductive ability, but [[Wellness (medicine)|wellness]] and [[physical fitness|fitness]]. In the [[Western culture|West]], slenderness is associated with happiness, success, youth, and social acceptability. Being [[overweight]] is associated with laziness. The media promote a weight-conscious standard for women more often than for men.&lt;ref name="Sex Roles"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Silverstein, Perdue, Peterson, and Kelly|title=The role of the mass media in promoting a thin standard of bodily attractiveness for women|journal=Sex Roles|year=1986|volume=14|issue=9–10|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/rn84077187531j83/|accessdate=11 April 2012|doi=10.1007/BF00287452|pages=519–532}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Deviance from these norms result in social consequences.&lt;ref name=SG&gt;{{cite book|last=Grogan|first=Sarah|title=Body Image Understanding body dissatisfaction in men, women, and Children|year=2008|publisher=Psychology Press|edition= Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media perpetuate this ideal in various ways, particularly glorifying and focusing on thin actors and actresses, models, and other public figures while avoiding the use or image of overweight individuals. This [[The Thin Ideal|thin ideal]] represents less than 5% of the American population.&lt;ref name="Summary Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAESAR: Summary statistics for the adult population (ages 18–65) of the United States of America|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA406674|accessdate=17 March 2012|last1=Harrison|first1=C.R. |last2=Robinette|first2=K.M. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been stated that the increase in [[eating disorder]]s over the past several decades has coincided with an overall decrease (pound-wise) in women's [[ideal body weight]] portrayed by the [[mass media]].&lt;ref name="No Longer Just a Pretty Face" /&gt; A group of researchers examined the magazines [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]], [[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]], [[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]], and [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] from 1959 to 1999.  [[Fashion model]]s became increasingly thinner during the 1980s and 1990s, making [[The Thin Ideal|the thin ideal]] even more difficult for women to achieve.  Photos depicting the models' entire bodies significantly increased in number from the 1960s to the 1990s.  From 1995 to 1999 models were dressed in far more revealing outfits than they were from 1959 to 1963.&lt;ref name="No Longer Just a Pretty Face"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sypeck|first=Mia Foley|author2=Gray, James J. |author3= Ahrens, Anthony H.|title=No Longer Just a Pretty Face: Fashion Magazines' Depictions of Ideal Female Beauty from 1959 to 1999|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|date=November 2004|volume=36|issue=3|pages=342–347|pmid=15478132|doi=10.1002/eat.20039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women's magazine]]s have been criticized for their conflicting messages, with an emphasis on [[food]], [[cooking]], [[child rearing]], and entertaining.  75% of women's magazines contain at least one ad or article about how to alter one's appearance through [[cosmetic surgery]], [[Dieting|diet]], or [[exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Malkin, Wornian, Chrisler|title=Women and Weight: Gendered Messages on Magazine Covers|journal=Sex Roles|year=1999|volume=40|doi=10.1023/A:1018848332464|pages=647–655}}&lt;/ref&gt; 25% of the women's magazines surveyed included tips for dieting or messages about weight loss.  Many women's magazines focus on how to lead a better life by improving physical appearance.  Megenta magazine released an article on "How to dress for your body type" giving tips and tricks to look the best in an outfit while striving to encourage women to feel comfortable in their skin.&lt;ref name="Magenta Magazine"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://magentamagazine.co.za/health_beauty/dressing-for-your-body-type-tips-tricks-with-style-by-loren/|title=How to dress for your body type - Magenta Magazine|date=2018-02-02|work=Magenta Magazine|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Magenta Magazine"/&gt; Men's magazines provide information about hobbies, activities, and entertainment in order for men to better their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty and Body Image in the Media |url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/issues/stereotyping/women_and_girls/women_beauty.cfm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118094138/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/issues/stereotyping/women_and_girls/women_beauty.cfm |archivedate=2009-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the research pertaining to how the media effects body image examines the change in models and magazine articles over time. Garner, Garfinkel, Schwartz, and Thompson paid particular attention to the difference in body shape of Playboy centerfolds over a 20-year period. They found that over the years, the body mass, bust, and hip measurements decreased; however, the height increased.  They also determined that the Playboy centerfolds were 13%-19% lower than the normal body weight for women of their age (Cusumano, Thompson 1997). Other studies found that over the years, magazines like Seventeen, YM, and Cosmopolitan all had an increase in articles pertaining to diet and exercise. Anderson and DiDomenico (1992) compared women's and men's popular magazines and found that diet and exercise articles appeared more than 10 times as much in women's magazines than men's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthpsych.psy.vanderbilt.edu/2009/BodyImageMedia.htm|title=Effects of the Media on Body Image|last=Kovar|first=Allie|date=30 April 2009|website=Vanderbilt Psychology Department|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==
Modeling and fashion industries have come under fire in recent years for embracing and promoting an ultra-thin appearance, giving "unhealthy stigma".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/summer-rayne-oakes/the-skinny-of-fashions-body-image-issue_b_3308004.html|title=The Skinny of Fashion's Body-Image Issue|last=Oakes|first=Summer|date=22 May 2013|website=Huffington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a data research done by Might Goods using 3,000 models from 20 leading model agencies, 94% of the models are underweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mightygoods.com/underweight-fashion-models|title=94% of All Fashion Models are underweight|last=|first=|date=11 September 2017|website=Mighty Goods|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in a recent study conducted by Jennifer Brenner and Joseph Cunningham, it was observed that the majority of female models were underweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brenner|first=Jennifer B.|last2=Cunningham|first2=Joseph G.|date=1992-10-01|title=Gender differences in eating attitudes, body concept, and self-esteem among models|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00289949|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=27|issue=7-8|pages=413–437|doi=10.1007/BF00289949|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The average American female fashion model begins working in the modeling business at ages 13–17 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/220912/average-age-for-models-to-start-in-the-business/|title=Models - average age for starting in the business {{!}} Survey 2011|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average female model in the United States weighs in ranging from 90 pounds to 120 pounds  and an average of 5'8" to 5'11" tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/maceyjforonda/street-style-surveys-what-are-the-ideal-stats-for-a-fashion|title=Street Style Surveys: What Are The Ideal Stats For A Fashion Model?|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the average weight of a female is 168.5 pounds, and the average height for females is 5'4".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm|title=FastStats|date=2017-08-14|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the AMA (American Medical Association), thin models on the catwalk as well as social media and fashion photography lead to unrealistic body expectations, which in turn could lead to eating disorders and other emotional problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=Viewpoints&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;searchType=TopicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=42&amp;docId=GALE%7CEJ3010659244&amp;docType=Viewpoint+essay&amp;sort=Relevance&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=OVIC&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CEJ3010659244&amp;topicId=00000000LVXR&amp;searchId=&amp;userGroupName=uiuc_oak&amp;inPS=true&amp;u=uiuc_oak&amp;authCount=1|title=Gale - Enter Product Login|website=go.galegroup.com|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the mass advertisement promoting thin body, plastic surgery and cosmetic surgery, women and young girls are being bombarded with this very idea of achieving thin body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://centerforchange.com/battling-bodies-understanding-overcoming-negative-body-images|title=Battling Our Bodies: Understanding and Overcoming Negative Body Images|last=Hawkins|first=Nicole|date=August 2014|website=Center For Change|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is being control by some countries such as Israel and France in which they regulate the body mass indexes of models and let the public know whether the ad images is manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.racked.com/2017/9/6/16263360/lvmh-kering-skinny-model-ban|title=This isn't the answer to fashion's body image issues|last=Lieber|first=Chavie|date=6 September 2017|website=Racked|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photoshop is, "the altering (a photographic image) with Photoshop software or other image-editing software especially in a way that distorts reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/photoshop|title=Definition of PHOTOSHOP|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerie, the lingerie line for American Eagle, began the campaign Aerie Real in which models were no longer photoshopped. A 2016 study showed that some women showed a smaller decrease in body satisfaction when seeing the photos of women untouched in comparison to the greater decrease in body satisfaction when seeing previous photos that were retouched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Convertino|first=Alexandra D|last2=Rodgers|first2=Rachel F|last3=Franko|first3=Debra L|last4=Jodoin|first4=Adriana|title=An evaluation of the Aerie Real campaign: Potential for promoting positive body image?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1359105316680022|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|doi=10.1177/1359105316680022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many well-known magazines have been called out for photoshopping, a few examples being ''AdWeek, InStyle, Modeliste Magazine, and Fashion Magazine.'' Celebrities have recently commented on changes that were made of their photos by such magazines. In 2015, Zendaya, a current 21 year old actress, singer, and dancer, posted two pictures side by side of her magazine photoshoot calling out the changes that were made by the magazine, Modeliste Magazine. She stated that, "There are the things that make women self conscious, that create the unrealistic ideals of beauty that we have".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/708613/zendaya-gets-photoshopped-singer-slams-magazine-for-promoting-unrealistic-beauty-ideals|title=Zendaya Slams Magazine for Photoshopping Her Pics|work=E!

Victoria's Secret puts on an annually televised Fashion Show in which its beautiful models walk down the runway in lingerie and latest releases for PINK, the clothing store of Victoria's Secret. In the televised showing, the models usually include how they prepared for the Fashion Show by showing clips of working out and dieting to prepare for the big day. A study published in 2013 analyzed the responses viewers were tweeting during the showing. Viewers discussed food, weight, eating disorders, and self-harm. The results of this study showed that vulnerable viewers could experience negative affect, or even engage in harmful behaviors, during or after viewing the show or others like it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-09-01|title=Suffering by comparison: Twitter users' reactions to the Victoria&amp;#x27;s Secret Fashion Show|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1740144513000594|journal=Body Image|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=648–652|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2013.05.001|issn=1740-1445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
In 28 [[primetime]] [[Situation comedy|situational comedies]] analyzed by researchers in 2002, 33% of the central female characters were below average weight.  As the thinness of a female character increased, the number of compliments she received from men did as well. Research has shown below average weight female characters are over represented, while above average weight female characters are underrepresented in situational comedies as compared to the norms of the US population. Primetime television shows that appeal to a primarily  [[female]] audience, such as [[Friends (TV series)|Friends]] or [[Ally McBeal]] are helmed by young, attractive, and thin women.  Extremely skinny or [[Emaciation|emaciated]] women are shown on [[fashion industry]] related shows, like [[House of Style]].&lt;ref name="Hegemonic Depictions"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henriks|first=Alexandra|title=Examining the effects of hegemonic depictions of female bodies on television: a call for theory and programmatic research|journal=Critical Studies in Media Communication|date=9 November 2010|volume=19|issue=1|pages=106–123|doi=10.1080/07393180216550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male characters often negatively comment on average and above average weight females' body shapes and weights and audiences usually react by laughing.  Male characters are not immune to unfair representation.  33% of male characters were below average weight and 13% were above average weight.  By comparison, approximately 30% of men in the US are overweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Fouts, Gregory  |author2=Vaughan, Kimberely |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Television Situation Comedies: Male Weight, Negative References, and Audience Reactions|journal=Sex Roles|date=June 2002|volume=46|issue=11/12|pages=439–442|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/vux1891n61umjl2g/|accessdate=9 March 2012|doi=10.1023/A:1020469715532}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2003 a study was conducted on ten top-rated American primetime fictional television programs.  33% of female television characters were underweight.&lt;ref name="Overweight and Obese"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Greenberg, Eastin, Hofschire, Lachlan, and Brownell|title=Portrayals of Overweight and Obese Individuals on Commercial Television|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=August 2003|volume=93|issue=8|url=http://www.yaleruddcenter.org/resources/upload/docs/what/bias/portrayals-of-overweight-and-obese-individuals.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2012|doi=10.2105/ajph.93.8.1342|pages=1342–1348|pmid=12893625|pmc=1447967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was done of 10 primetime television programs on each of the 6 major [[TV network]]s ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[UPN]], [[NBC]], and [[WB Television Network|WB]]) with the largest [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen audience ratings]] during the 1999–2000 season.  Of the 1018 characters on all of the shows 14% of females and 24% of males were overweight or obese.  These numbers represent less than half the percentage of overweight or obese males and females in the general population.  Overweight female characters were less likely to be considered attractive, display physical affection, or to connect with romantic partners.  Overweight males characters were less likely to interact with friends or romantic partners and less likely to talk about dating.  Overweight males characters were often shown eating.  These statistics are representative of the fat stigmatization present in many US television programs.&lt;ref name="Portrayals of Overweight and Obese Individuals on TV"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Greenberg, Eastin, Hofschire, Lachlan, and Brownell|title=Portrayals of Overweights and Obese Individuals on Commercial Televisions|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=August 2003|volume=93|issue=8|doi=10.2105/ajph.93.8.1342|pages=1342–1348|pmid=12893625|pmc=1447967}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small number of fat female television characters that do exist are consistently depicted in relation to thinner, highly [[sexualized]] female characters.  These characters are used as props, against which thinner women are compared, judged and valued.

A study in Fiji showed that the introduction of western television had a detrimental effect on young women's perceptions and eating behaviors. Three fourths of the girls in the study reported feeling fat after prolonged exposure to western television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=A.E.|title=Television, disordered eating, and young women in Fiji: negotiating body image and identity during rapid social change|journal=Culture, Medicine, and Psychiatry|date=2004|volume=28 4|pages=533–59|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, analysts sampled 135 scenes featuring overweight individuals from popular television programs and movies and coded for [[Anti-fat bias|anti-fat]] humor. The majority of anti-fat humor found was verbal and directed at the individual in their presence, with no regard for their feelings.&lt;ref name="Obesity TV/Movies"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Himes and Thompson|title=Fat Stigmatization in Television Shows and Movies: A Content Analysis|journal=Obesity|year=2007|volume=15|pages=712–718|url=http://www.nature.com/oby/journal/v15/n3/full/oby2007635a.html|issue=3|doi=10.1038/oby.2007.635}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self-deprecation|Self-deprecating]] fat comments were much less common than those about or directed at another person.  Male character were three times more likely to engaged in fat commentary than female characters.  Media programs containing fat stigmatization content often are popular and have high ratings, suggesting that the general public finds it acceptable to overlook such remarks in the context of the story.&lt;ref name="Obesity TV/Movies" /&gt;

According to Renee Hobbs, EdD, associate professor of communications at Temple University, the average teen girl gets about 180 minutes of media exposure daily and only about 10 minutes of parental interaction a day. Girls often take drastic measures in an attempt to become like the media images they view. Many end up with very low self-esteem and dangerous eating disorders.  Elissa Gittes, MD, a pediatrician in the division of adolescent medicine at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh says "We're seeing girls at younger ages starting to be dissatisfied with their bodies, proactively trying to change them, and feeling like they need to emulate something different than what their bodies can do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/helping-girls-with-body-image#1|title=Helping Girls With Body Image|last=Heubeck|first=Elizabeth|date=|website=WebMD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video games==
In 2009 a content analysis of 150 top-selling [[video game]]s found that games rated for children depicted female characters as significantly thinner than female characters in games rated for adults. Females in video games had significantly larger heads, but smaller chest sizes, waists, and hips than the average American woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martins, Williams, Harrison, and Ratan|title=A Content Analysis of Female Body Imagery in Video Games|journal=Sex Roles|year=2009|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9682-9|volume=61|pages=824–836}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a study showed that after playing video games, both female and male college-aged participants had significantly lower body esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barlett|first=Christopher P.|last2=Harris|first2=Richard J.|date=2008-10-01|title=The Impact of Body Emphasizing Video Games on Body Image Concerns in Men and Women|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-008-9457-8|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=59|issue=7–8|pages=586–601|doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9457-8|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The muscular male body in mass media and video is the cause of many symptoms such as body dissatisfaction and body esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barlelt|first=Christopher|date=2008|title=Meta-Analyses of the Effects of Media Images on Men's Body-image Concerns|url=https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.2008.27.3.279|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume= 27|pages= 279–310|via=Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, adolescent boys age 13-18 spend nine hours on average playing video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barlett|first=Christopher|date=May 2008|title=The Impact of Body Emphasizing Video Games on Body Image Concerns in Men and Women|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-008-9457-8|journal=Sex Roles|volume= 59| issue = 7-8|pages= 586–601|via=Springer Link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to these unattainable avatars within video games lead to higher body dissatisfaction, and in turn lead to many other social and psychology problems. Garner reported that 41% of teenage 13–19 years old boys were found to be dissatisfied with their overall body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/199702/body-image-in-america-survey-results|title=Body Image in America: Survey Results|last=Garner|first=David|date=1 February 1997|website=Psychology Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research done by Zeely Sylvia from Bridgewater State University found that: players who played game with character who had a more average body size and shape would display less  body esteem concern than players who played with unrealistic muscular body character. The research concludes that muscularity concerns play a large role in the construct of male body image, and may have a substantial influence on male body esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sylvia|first=Zeely|date=2013|title=Virtual Ideals|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1262&amp;context=undergrad_rev|journal=The Effect of Video Game Play On Male Body Image|volume= 9|pages= 165–166|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-fiction media==
In 2001, British newspaper ''The Independent'' wrote about the silhouette of American TV stars like [[Calista Flockhart]] and [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] and compared it to that of the women in Pop group [[Destiny's Child]] saying, "The lollipop silhouette long-favoured by the female stars of American sitcoms, which involves disproportionately large heads wobbling atop stick-thin bodies does not say rich and it doesn't say clever. It says take me to a clinic. The New Athleticism, however, sends out a rather different set of messages: strong, confident, independent woman."&lt;ref name=SG/&gt;

[[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[Richard Carmona]] speaks of obesity as the "terror within" and says "unless we do something about it, the magnitude of the dilemma will dwarf [[9/11|9–11]] or any other terrorist attempt." The news media has been criticized for its alarmist and overly dramatized reporting on the issue of weight and obesity.  By using key words such as "war" or "epidemic" in their reporting, the news media attracts greater attention to the issue.  News reports likely reinforce the stigma of fat bodies, linking them to disease and likening fatness to a health behavior instead of an inalterable trait.&lt;ref name="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2004.00399.x-i1/pdf"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Saguy and Almeling|title=Fat in the Fire?

In September 2011 nationally syndicated columnist [[Michael Kinsley]], the founding editor of [[Slate (magazine)|Slate magazine]], wrote harshly critical remarks about [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] and his weight. Kinsley wrote "New Jersey Governor Chris Christie cannot be president: He is just too fat . . .why should Christie's weight be more than we can bear in a president? Why should it even be a legitimate issue if he runs? One reason is that a presidential candidate should be judged on behavior and character . . . Perhaps Christie is the one to help us get our national appetites under control. But it would help if he got his own under control first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Michael|first=Kinsley|title=Requiem for a Governor Before He's in the Ring: Michael Kinsley|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-30/requiem-for-a-governor-before-he-s-in-the-ring-michael-kinsley.html|publisher=Bloomberg News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's media==
A content analysis done of children's videos and books found that 72% of videos and 7.5% of books placed emphasis on physical attractiveness.  In 60% of videos, a character's love for another depends on physical appearance and attractiveness. Examples include [[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]], where the prince invites maidens to the ball to select a bride and [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]], where the Beast falls in love with Belle purely based upon her physical appearance.  In 72% of videos and 10% of books characters with thin bodies have desirable traits.  In 84% of videos and 10% of books female physical attractiveness is associated with kindness, sociability, and happiness.  While 60% of videos portray female thinness, only 32% show male muscularity.  No physical attraction is shown between a slender character and an obese character, with the exception of Beauty and the Beast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook-Cottone|first=Catherine|date=28 Mar 2018|title=Eating Disorders|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10640266.2018.1451684|journal=The journal of treatment and prevention|volume= 26|pages= 105–106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2010 involved one hundred and twenty one girls age 3-6 to determine the effects of brief exposure to appearance‐related media on young girls' body image. The exposure ended up not affecting body dissatisfaction. Although nearly all the girls did like how they looked ⅓ would change one physical thing and half were worried of becoming fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Sharon|last2=Tantleff-Dunn|first2=Stacey|date=2010-06-01|title=Am I too fat to be a princess?

In 64% of children's videos and 20% of books obesity is related to negative traits.  Obese characters are often shown as evil, unfriendly, cruel, and unattractive. Ursula from [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]] is an obese, unattractive octopus.  In 40% of videos and 20% of books at least one obese character is disliked by others.  Obese characters are shown thinking about food or depicted in setting related to food in 52% of videos and 20% of books.  Children's media is perpetuating the "what is beautiful is good" stereotype through its portrayals of thin and obese characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Herbozo, Tantleff-Dunn, Gokee-Larose, and Thompson|title=Beauty and Thinness Messages in Children's Media: A Content Analysis|journal=Eating Disorders: The Journal of Treatment &amp; Prevention|year=2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=21–34|doi=10.1080/10640260490267742|pmid=16864302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social Media==
Social media consists of websites like Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest and Facebook enable users to produce and share content. Thinspiration images that promote the idealization of thinness and pro-eating disorder websites are becoming increasingly more prevalent throughout social media. Pro-eating disorder (i.e. pro-ana and pro-bulimia) websites are forms of social media where  individuals can share advice and images that encourage their peers to engage in eating disorder behaviors. These websites have been shown to have deleterious effects because they communicate to the viewer that the thin ideal is something that is not only attainable but also necessary. Women are more likely to compare themselves online when they feel the need to improve their appearance. Women with low self-esteem are more likely to feel dissatisfied after comparing themselves to images on social and women who struggle with preexisting eating disorders may exacerbate them through social media fueled body comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perloff|first1=Richard M.|title=Social Media Effects on Young Women's Body Image Concerns: Theoretical Perspectives and an Agenda for Research|journal=Sex Roles|date=29 May 2014|volume=71|issue=11-12|pages=363–377|doi=10.1007/s11199-014-0384-6|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study on college women in the US concluded that women who spent a significant amount of time on Facebook had increased body dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eckler|first1=Petya|last2=Kalyango|first2=Yusuf|last3=Paasch|first3=Ellen|title=Facebook use and negative body image among U.S. college women|journal=Women &amp; Health|date=2 March 2016|volume=57|issue=2|pages=249–267|doi=10.1080/03630242.2016.1159268|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lasting effects on viewers==
"A study of 6,928 girls ages 9 to 14 years old found that the desire to emulate the appearance of females on television, in movies, and in magazines was predictive of beginning purging behavior at least on a monthly basis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrie|first1=Z.|last2=Sullivan|first2=E.A.|last3=Davies|first3=P.S.W.|last4=Hill|first4=R.J.|title=Media Influence on the Body Image of Children and Adolescents, Eating Disorders|journal=Eating Disorders: The Journal of Treatment &amp; Prevention|date=2006|volume=14|issue=5|pages=355–364|doi=10.1080/10640260600952506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 92% of women feel pressure to conform to the standards of beauty which the media perpetuates.  After viewing images of women with "ideal" body weights, 95% of women overestimate their body size and 40% overestimate the size of their waist, hips, cheeks, or thighs.  Those with [[eating disorder]]s, such as [[anorexia nervosa]] or [[bulimia nervosa]], show a significant increase in overestimation of body size after viewing such images.  Similarly males who are exposed to body-related advertisements show an increase in body dissatisfaction and depression.&lt;ref name="Hegemonic Depictions" /&gt;  Men shown advertisements containing images of exceptionally muscular men were shown to be dissatisfied with their own musculature, not their body fat, after viewing such advertisements.  This finding is consistent with previous evidence that states muscularity is more important than body fat in men's body satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Muscle Dysmorphia"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leit, Gray, and Pope|title=The Media's Representation of the Ideal Male Body: A Cause for Muscle Dysmorphia?|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|year=2002|volume=31|issue=3|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eat.10019/pdf|doi=10.1002/eat.10019|pages=334–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The correlation between media image and body image has been proven; in one study, among European American and African American girls ages 7 – 12, greater overall television exposure predicted both a thinner ideal adult body shape and a higher level of disordered eating one year later. Adolescent girls are the most strongly affected demographic; "More and more 12-year-old girls are going on diets because they believe what you weigh determines your worth," Cutler observed. "When all you see is a body type that only two percent of the population has, it's difficult to remember what's real and what's reasonable to expect of yourself and everyone else." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hamilton.edu/news/story/the-medias-effect-on-womens-body-image&lt;/ref&gt;

Put simply, the beauty ideal in American culture is: thin. "Large populations of 'average' girls do not demonstrate clinically diagnosable eating disorders—pathologies that the culture marks as extreme and unhealthy—but rather an entirely normative obsession with body shape and size," Cutler said. "This ongoing concern is accepted as a completely normal and even inevitable part of being a modern girl. I think we need to change that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hamilton.edu/news/story/the-medias-effect-on-womens-body-image|title=The Media's Effect on Women's Body Image|last=Ossola|first=Alexandra|date=1 September 2010|website=Hamilton|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young adults and teens are very vulnerable to addict of social media usage because they do not know different life, world, and functioning without it. "Teens and young adults are considered particularly at risk. They're a generation raised on the internet, social media, and digital technology so these things are integral, indispensable parts of their lives. Young people also are impressionable, eager for acceptance, and relatively inexperienced, which can cloud judgment." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Good, Bad, and In-between of Social Media|url=https://carrierclinic.org/resources/good-bad-in-between-of-social-media/|website=carrierclinic.org|publisher=carrierclinic.org|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Statistics And Interesting Facts:'''

1.) More than 40% of consumers say that information found via social media affects the way they deal with their health.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://getreferralmd.com/2013/09/healthcare-social-media-statistics/|title=24 Outstanding Statistics &amp; Figures on How Social Media has Impacted the Health Care Industry|last=Honigman|first=Brian|date=2018|website=ReferralMD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2.) 90% of respondents from 18 to 24 years of age said they would trust medical information shared by others on their social media networks.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

3.) 18 to 24 year olds are more than 2x as likely than 45 to 54 year olds to use social media for health-related discussions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

4.) 19% of smartphone owners have at least one health app on their phone. Exercise, diet, and weight apps are the most popular types.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

5.)  41% of people said social media would affect their choice of a specific doctor, hospital, or medical facility.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Several studies have shown that race and ethnicity can affect the way women perceive body image.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=Meg|date=2001|title=Disturbances in the Social Body: Differences in Body Image and Eating Problems among African American and White Women|url=http://electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edsjsr&amp;AN=edsjsr.3081846&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|journal=Gender and Society|volume=15 |issue=2|pages=239–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hesse-Biber, et al.|first=Sharlene|date=Nov 2017|title=Racial Identity and Body Image Among Black Female College Students Attending Predominately White Colleges.|url=http://electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edb&amp;AN=55457070&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|journal=Sex Roles|volume=63| issue = 9-10|pages=697–711|via=Complementary Index}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poran|first=Maya, A.|date=2006|title=The politics of protection: body image, social pressures, and the misrepresentation of young Black women|url=http://electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edsggo&amp;AN=edsgcl.157839568&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|journal=Sex Roles|volume=55|pages=739–755|via=General OneFile}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women of color often have different perceptions of body image than white women—a difference that may be linked to cultural differences such as family and community experiences and racial or ethnic pride, and other differences such as childhood influences (e.g., school environment).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ultimately, these differences may have lasting effects on the ways in which white and non-white women are affected by media depictions and cultural ideals of body image and beauty.

Lovejoy finds in her research—which compares the perceptions of body image and eating disorders in black and white women through a literature review—that the strategies (e.g., resistance to mainstream beauty ideals) that black women use to challenge mainstream depictions of female bodies and develop positive self-valuations are often strengthened through support from other black women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These same types of supportive communities were not replicated in the same way for white women in the literature. Lovejoy argues that this difference in support can influence the way black and white women are affected by damaging ideals of body image and beauty. Namely, black women may be less susceptible to these damaging ideals than white women as a result of strong support within their communities.

However, such research does not suggest that black women are not affected by damaging ideals of body image and beauty. Maya A. Poran finds that "[c]ontrary to popular theories that propose that Black women are protected by a 'Black Culture' that buffers them from negative effects of body representations—thereby leaving them with higher body esteem," black women in her study did experience "(1) pressures to be thin, (2) pressures from the preferences of men of diverse ethnicities, (3) competition with other Black women in the realms of beauty, and (4) a strong sense of being misrepresented by media images of thin Black women." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Therefore, while it is important to recognize the contribution of supportive communities on the positive self-valuation that some black women may experience, it is important that this not obscure the damaging impact that harmful ideals of body image and beauty may have on black women.

'''''Murasaki Baby''''' is a side-scrolling [[puzzle]]-[[platformer]] video game developed by Italian video game company [[Ovosonico]] for the [[PlayStation Vita]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/20/gamescom-2013-murasaki-baby-revealed&lt;/ref&gt; The game was designed by Massimo Guarini&lt;ref&gt;http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/20/4641886/murasaki-baby-coming-to-ps-vita-in-2014&lt;/ref&gt; who previously worked on ''[[Shadows of the Damned]]''.

==Gameplay==
The game's art direction follows the style of [[Edward Gorey]]. The titular character, known only as "Baby", is a twisted, malformed young girl who has dark, baggy eyes, a pink bowtie, short, curly hair, a mouth of cracked, misshaped teeth on her forehead, and stick figure limbs. She carries a purple heart-shaped balloon as well as many other enemies in the game.

The game world is a world populated by children's fantasies and fears. Using the Vita touch screen, the player must guide Baby through the world by "holding" her hand and guiding her throughout the game.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2013/08/20/murasaki-baby-unveiled-for-ps-vita/&lt;/ref&gt; By using the touch pad, the player can change the atmosphere of the world.

==Reception==
[[Metacritic]], a [[review aggregator]], rated the game 69/100 based on 48 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/murasaki-baby|title=Murasaki Baby|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[GameRankings]] rated it 69.91%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/vita/727976-murasaki-baby/index.html|title=Murasaki Baby|work=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hardcore Gamer]] rated it 4.5/5 and wrote, "Every Vita owner needs to experience ''Murasaki Baby''. By creating a personal and engaging story, all while wrapping it in a hypnotically original art design, Ovosonico have gone where most other developers fear to tread."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/09/16/review-murasaki-baby/103743/|title=Review: Murasaki Baby|last=Carlson|first=Alex|work=[[Hardcore Gamer]]|date=2014-09-16|accessdate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eurogamer]] rated it 8/10 and wrote, "Yes, the touch controls sometimes work against it and, like Baby, the game occasionally stumbles over its own feet, but for the most part it walks the fine line between the weird and the wonderful with aplomb."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-09-16-murasaki-baby-review|title=Murasaki Baby review|last=Harman|first=Stace|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=2014-09-16|accessdate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[IGN]] rated it 7.5/10 and wrote, "Filled with interesting ideas, ''Murasaki Baby''{{'}}s dazzling animation and unique approach to platforming are enticing.

      <comment>"Valiant" is not the proper English word to use as part of the translation. The Latin origin of "valiant" is "valere" which is associated with strong physical attributes. The expression clearly relates to one's own intellectual determination.  "Volentibus" translates to "those who are willing" or "those who wish to".</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5028">'''''Nil volentibus arduum''''' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] expression meaning "nothing is impossible for those willing", and the name of a 17th-century [[The Netherlands|Dutch]] literary society that tried to bring [[French literature]] to the [[Dutch Republic]].

==Short history of the literary society==
[[File:Familiewapen Tak.jpg|thumb|Coat of arms of the Dutch Tak family]]

===Introduction===
The ''Nil volentibus arduum'' [[literary society]] attempted to dictate the terms of the [[Dutch literature|Dutch literary world]] and to exert intellectual influence by imposing the poetic rules of [[Aristotle]], [[Horace]], and [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux]].

This society of [[francophile]]s&lt;ref&gt;Note that an article published Wednesday 16 June 2010 in ''[[Le Soir]]'', presented a [[polemic]] saying that this group of [[intellectual]]s and defenders of [[French culture]] were, on the contrary, the enemies of both it and the ''[[Académie française]]'':
:'''''Nil volentibus arduum...''''' ''"À cœur vaillant, rien d’impossible"'' (To a valiant heart, nothing is impossible )'' was the Latin adage with which [[Bart De Wever]] introduced his victory speech on election night, and is also the The name also refers to a group of poets founded in [[Amsterdam]] in the second half of the 17th century, whose goal was to weaken the dictatorial power of the [[Académie française]] in the world of theatre in Europe. [[Bart De Wever]] did not evoke this sort of anti-francophone sentiment...'' (article signed Dirk Vanoverbeke).&lt;/ref&gt; ardently defended French letters in the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], and as Jan Fransen:&lt;ref name=jj/&gt;

:''In their critiques the members of “Nil (volentibus arduum)” reproached their adversaries with not understanding even the French they translate.&lt;ref name=jj&gt;{{cite book|title=Comediens Francais en Hollande: Au XVIIe Et Au XVIIIe Siecles |work=Revue de literature comparée (Review of Comparative Literature)| issue=25|author=Jan Fransen |via=Google Books, Editie herdruk Uitgever Slatkine Reprints|year=1925 |publisher=[[University of Virginia]] (Gedigitaliseerd 29 June 2010) |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=0ssLAQAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- the implication here is that this is a bare minimum because this is the stuff you think you know let alone the stuff everyone knows you don't --&gt;  French tragedy and theatre &lt;!-- in this period is probably not a comedy; at least check --&gt; came closest to their ideal; they introduced it with or without force onto the Dutch scene. With this goal, they translated and adapted classic works by [[Pierre Corneille]], [[Jean Racine]] and [[Molière]] and corrected these great poets without flinching.''

===Historic and literary context===
In 1669, in [[Amsterdam]], a literary discussion on the subject of theatre led to the creation of a new artistic society, named ''{{lang|la|Nil volentibus arduum}}''.&lt;ref name="nn"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.literatuurgeschiedenis.nl/lg/goudeneeuw/literatuurgeschiedenis/lgge016.html |title=Over smaak valt niet te twisten: Verschillende opvattingen over toneel rond 1670.|language=nl| work=literatuurgeschiedenis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, the [[Amsterdam]] scene had been in the grip of glassmaker (''vitrier'') and writer [[Jan Vos (poet)|Jan Vos]] (1610/1611-1667), who among other points expressed with the [[adage]] ''{{lang|nl|Het zien gaat voor het zeggen}}'' (« La vision précède la parole », (seeing precedes speaking)) the idea that visual elements were more expressive than words.&lt;ref name="nn" /&gt; Vos was able to give himself over completely to his predilection for the visual thanks to his contacts in the Amsterdam government, who commissioned the stained-glass windows of the new [[Paleis op de Dam]] in 1655, as well as the large open-air living sculptures organized to greet important visitors. He also conceived ballets and theatrical productions, both his own and by other authors. His own works abounded in dramatical scenes. As regent of the {{ILL|Théâtre de Van Campen|fr}}, Vos exercised considerable influence over its programming. To make special effects, like rapid changes of scenery and flying movements, possible—since the [[public]] adored such spectacles—he renovated the theatre in 1664–1665. But the popularity of Vos' work also rested on scenes of horror with elements like [[assassination]]s, [[hanging]]s, dismemberment and other dark cruelties. Emotion and violence habitually constituted ingredients in his pieces: not because they rejoiced in such [[spectacles]], but because his objective was to show the dangers of intemperance.&lt;ref name="nn" /&gt;

{{UK Pirate Radio}}
'''UK pirate radio''', [[pirate radio|unlicensed illegal broadcasting]], was popular in the 1960s and experienced another surge of interest in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;{{Cite | last = Fleming| first = Carole| last2 = Wilby| first2 = Pete| title = The radio handbook| publisher = Routledge| page = 31-33| edition = 2| year = 2002| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PYoVjocKbKIC&amp;dq=%22pirate+radio%22+bbc | isbn = 0-415-15828-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently an estimated 150 pirate radio stations in the UK. A large proportion of these pirate radio stations operate in London, with significant clusters in [[Harlesden]] and the wider [[London Borough of Brent]], [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]], [[Stoke Newington]], the [[London Borough of Southwark]], the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] and [[London Borough of Lambeth]]&lt;ref name=ofcom&gt;{{Cite web| title = Illegal Broadcasting – Understanding the issues | publisher = Ofcom| page = 3-5,12-13| year = 2007| url = http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/other/radio-research/illegal-broadcasting/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==1960s==
[[Image:Mi Amigo kleine.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ''MV Mi Amigo'', c. 1974, which had been used as the home of Radio Caroline South from 1964 to 1968 and 1972–1980]]
"Pirate radio" in the UK first became widespread in the early 1960s when pop music stations such as [[Radio Caroline]] and [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]] started to broadcast on [[medium wave]] to the UK from offshore ships or disused sea forts. At the time, these stations were not illegal because they were broadcasting from international waters. The stations were set up by entrepreneurs and music enthusiasts to meet the growing demand for pop and rock music, which was not catered for by the legal [[BBC Radio]] services.&lt;ref name="ofcom"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;Robert Chapman, ''Selling the Sixties: The Pirates and Pop Music Radio'' London: :Routledge, 1992 {{ISBN|0415078172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first British pirate radio station was [[Radio Caroline]], which was launched by Irish music entrepreneur Ronan O'Rahilly, and started broadcasting from a ship off the [[Essex]] coast in 1964. By 1967 ten pirate radio stations were broadcasting to an estimated daily audience of 10 to 15 million. Influential [[History of radio disc jockeys#Pirate radio DJs|pirate radio DJs]] included [[John Peel]], [[Tony Blackburn]], [[Kenny Everett]], [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]], [[Tony Prince]], [[Emperor Rosko]] and [[Spangles Muldoon]].&lt;ref name="Chignell2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh Chignell|title=Key Concepts in Radio Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZU0oAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT146|date=5 March 2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4739-0360-9|pages=146–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The format of this wave of pirate radio was influenced by [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] and American radio stations. Many followed a top 40 format with casual DJs, making UK pirate radio the antithesis of [[BBC radio]] at the time.&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Spurred on by the offshore stations, landbased pirate stations took to the air on medium wave at weekends, such as Radio Free London in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flashesandflames.com/2014/03/how-a-radio-ship-and-7-men-shook-up-britain-50-years-ago/|title=How a radio ship and 7 men shook up Britain in 1964|work=Flashes &amp; Flames}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1965 pirate radio had a British audience of 10 to 15 million, and by 1966 sold almost £2&amp;nbsp;million worth of advertising a year to customers including the government-funded [[Egg Marketing Board]]. Radio Caroline's audience was one third the size of the [[Light Programme]] in the parts of the country where it could be received, but the Light Programme's audience did not decrease, indicating that pirate radio appealed to an audience that the BBC did not serve.&lt;ref name="crisell1997"&gt;{{cite book | title=An Introductory History of British Broadcasting | publisher=Routledge | author=Crisell, Andrew | year=1997 | pages=142–143 | isbn=0-415-12802-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the popularity of pirate radio BBC radio was restructured in 1967, establishing [[BBC Radio 1]], [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]], [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]] and [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]. A number of DJs of the newly created pop music service BBC Radio 1 came from pirate stations. The UK Government also closed the international waters loophole via the [[Marine Broadcasting Offences Act]] of 1967, although Radio Caroline continued to broadcast (with some sizeable off-air periods between 1968 and 1972 and 1980–83) until 1990.&lt;ref name="ofcom"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1970s and 1980s ==
The 1967 [[Marine Broadcasting Offences Act]] officially outlawed offshore stations, but unlicensed radio continued, moving from ships and sea-based platforms to urban areas in the latter part of the 1960s (they were already illegal under the [[Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949]]).&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, home-made medium wave (and sometimes [[short wave]]) transmitters were often constructed inside cheap, expendable biscuit tins.

The main method employed by most medium-wave or short-wave pirate stations during the 1960s and 70s involved programming played back on cassette recorders (often powered by a car battery), with a long wire antenna slung up between two trees. Around this time, VHF/FM transmitters were being built by more adventurous builders. A surge in pirate radio occurred when cheap portable transmitters became available and by the mid-1980s a 50 watt radio transmitter could be obtained for around £200, or could be built for less. The operation of a pirate radio station required a good quality [[cassette recorder]], a transmitter and a high roof, with tower blocks providing the ideal transmission site for pirate radio stations. A 40 watt transmitter broadcasting from the roof of a fifteen-storey tower block could reach a forty-mile radius. Radio shows were often pre-recorded at home, with the pirate radio station operators setting up temporary transmitters on the roof of tower blocks.&lt;ref name="cutnmix"&gt;{{Cite | last = Hebdige| first = Dick | title = Cut'n’mix: culture, identity, and Caribbean music| publisher = Taylor and Francis| page =154-156| year = 1987| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bqcOAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22pirate+radio%22+bbc | isbn = 9780906890998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970s and 1980s saw a wave of landbased pirate radio, broadcasting mostly in big cities. These included community-focused local stations such as [[Sunshine 855|Sunshine Radio]] in Shropshire and [[Radio Jackie]] in south west London. In London pirate stations emerged that, for the first time in UK radio broadcasting, focused on particular music genres such as Radio Invicta (92.4 FM) Europe's first soul station, started in 1970. Horizon Radio (94.5 and 102.5 FM) broadcast from 1981 until September 1985 and was also known for [[soul music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Horizon Radio  Soul music radio, 1981 - 1985.|url=http://www.amfm.org.uk/pirates/horizon-radio.html|website=AM-FM|publisher=amfm.org.uk|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 70s [[Birmingham]] was the home of a music scene comparable to that of [[Liverpool]],&lt;ref name="AMG-IdleRace"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eder|first=Bruce|title=The Idle Race|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-idle-race-p18402/biography|accessdate=6 May 2012|publisher=All Music Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of pirate stations arose there, including Mix FM, Real Radio and the [[PCRL|Peoples Community Radio Link]] (PCRL), which began broadcasting in 1985 on 103.7 FM and was often the only pirate on air in the West Midlands.&lt;ref name="HindMosco1985"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Hind|author2=Stephen Mosco|title=Rebel Radio: The Full Story of British Pirate Radio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zmm4AAAAIAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-0-7453-0055-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thepiratearchive.net/pcrl/|title=PCRL|publisher=The Pirate Archive|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pirate radio met with increasing opposition, especially from the authorities in the form of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) Radio Regulatory Division (and later the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI) after it became responsible for radio regulation) which had claimed since the late 1960s that pirate radio caused interference to licensed broadcasters and could interfere with frequencies used by emergency services. Nonetheless the growth of pirate radio in the 1980s was so rapid that at one point pirate radio operators outnumbered legal broadcasters. Pirate stations such as [[Radio Invicta (London Pirate Station)|Radio Invicta]], Horizon Radio, JFM, and London Weekend Radio continued to gain popularity and increasingly operated openly.&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Pirate radio targeted music communities ignored by mainstream broadcasting, such as [[reggae]], [[hip hop]], [[jazz]], [[indie rock|indie rock, indie pop]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. Stations like [[London Greek Radio]], which broadcast to the Greek and Greek Cypriot community, also catered to ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1990s ==
By 1989, there were about 600 pirate radio stations in the UK, with over 60 in London. In the 1990s, a new wave of acid house and rave stations emerged, such as Sunrise, [[Centreforce]] and Fantasy FM. In the early 1990s, pirate radio briefly declined in response to tougher penalties, an intensified crackdown by the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI) and the leading dance pirate radio station [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss FM]] responding to the Government's offer of amnesty for pirate stations that closed down voluntarily and applied for an official license. But Kiss FM failed to satisfy the rising [[rave]] audience and pirate radio resurged in 1992 and 1993. The new pirate radio stations abandoned the mainstream pop radio format and moved to a "raves on the air" format with strong emphasis on audience participation, enabled by the spread of mobile phones - stations notably including [[Kool FM]], Rush FM, Defection and [[Don FM]]. Pirate radio stations would frequently lose transmitters worth several hundred pounds due to DTI raids, redirecting to backup transmitters on the roof of another building to maintain broadcast continuity.

Pirate radio stations would gain revenue from advertising [[rave]]s and specialist record shops, as well as DJs who paid a fee for playing. At this stage, some stations such as London Greek Radio had huge followings, and LGR were broadcasting with an aerial on the roof of a store. Other stations such as the Sunday Station Rock FM were broadcasting live from home studios linked via wireless links to their main tower block transmitter. RFM DJs each had their own microwave links to the transmitter from their home studios in New Cross, Hertford, and Hainault to name but three locations. Unlike stations playing Rave music, and taking advertising, RFM had no advertisers and built a significant following, helped by write-ups in Time Out and other culture magazines and a mailing address.  On Saturdays, London Rock also built a significant following, broadcasting from a transmitter atop Simla House near London Bridge. As with RFM, the station played rock music and was not aided by advertising or the rave scene to which these stations had no connections. The ethos on both stations was about the music – They shared DJs on occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite | last = Reynolds| first = Simon | title = Generation ecstasy: into the world of techno and rave culture| publisher = Routledge| page = 265| year = 1999| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tGaRJiXe74UC&amp;dq=%22pirate+radio%22+rave | isbn = 9780415923736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] led to the brief decline of UK pirate radio by encouraging diversity in radio and opening up the development of commercial radio. Many pirate radio stations such as the London-based dance music station [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss FM]] applied for licenses to the new Radio Authority and went legitimate. However, the number of unlicensed broadcasts has since increased, partly because many non-licensed broadcasters believed that the 1990 Act had actually undermined community-based stations and small scale radio entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Of the pirate radio stations that gained a license in the 1990s, such as [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss FM]], [[Kiss 101|FTP]] in Bristol, WNK Radio in [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]] and [[KFM Radio]] in [[Stockport]], only a few, such as [[Sunrise Radio]] in London, remained in the hands of the original owners. Most have become significantly more mainstream and target a broad audience as a result of commercial pressures to achieve greater audience numbers and a particular audience type sought by advertisers.&lt;ref name="ofcom"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-late 1990s, genres such as happy hardcore, drum'n'bass and garage saw a new generation of pirate radio stations emerge. In London, stations such as Kool FM were joined by Rude, [[Dream FM (London)|Dream FM]], [[Flex FM]], Deja Vu, London Underground, Freek, and most notably [[Rinse FM]].

== 2000s to present ==
There are currently an estimated 150 pirate radio stations in the UK. A large proportion of these pirate radio stations operate in London, with significant clusters in [[Harlesden]], Crystal Palace, [[Stoke Newington]], [[Southwark]] and [[Lambeth]].&lt;ref name="ofcom"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Set-up costs for pirate radio stations are minimal with a transmitter generally built by the engineer of the station. In days gone by these were powered by car batteries, but when the Pirates moved to tower blocks, the power came directly from the block room. Pirate radio stations may receive income from advertising and publicising events at nightclubs. DJs may pay to broadcast on pirate radio stations to gain public exposure.&lt;ref name="ofcom"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006 [[Ofcom]] commissioned research among residents of the London boroughs of [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]] and [[Lambeth]], finding that about 24 percent of all adults aged 14 or older living within the three London boroughs listen to pirate radio stations. The research found that 37 percent of students aged 14–24 and 41 percent of the [[British African-Caribbean community|African-Caribbean community]] listened to pirate radio. The development and promotion of grass-roots talent, the [[urban music]] scene and minority community groups were identified as key drivers for pirate radio. According to the research both pirate radio listeners and those running pirate radio stations thought that licensed broadcasters failed to cater sufficiently for the needs of the public at large. Pirate radio was regarded as the best place to hear new music and particularly urban music. Furthermore, pirate radio stations were appreciated for their local relevance by providing information and advertisements about local community events, businesses and club nights.&lt;ref name="ofcom"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community radio==

Since 2010, [[Ofcom]] have promoted the take-up of [[Community_radio_in_the_United_Kingdom|Community Radio]], especially in areas such as London with a concentration of pirate radio stations.&lt;ref name="commradio"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Community radio | publisher = Ofcom| year = 2007| url = http://www.ofcom.org.uk/manage-your-licence/radio-broadcast-licensing/community-radio/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, a number of former pirate radio stations have made the transition to legal broadcasting through community radio licenses, such as [[Rinse FM]], [[Kane 103.7 FM|Kane FM]], and most recently [[Flex FM]]. Others have embraced [[internet radio]], whether that be in addition to radio transmitting, or moving towards it as their primary broadcasting medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/arts/music/london-pirate-radio.html| title=London’s Radio Pirates Changed Music. Then Came the Internet.|author=Annalisa Quinn|date=3 October 2018|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some remain skeptical of the ability of the local community and pirate broadcasters to make the move to legal status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Concrete jungle: Hackney’s pirate DJs resist rooftop station crackdown | publisher = Hackney Citizen | date = 8 June 2015| url = https://www.hackneycitizen.co.uk/2015/06/08/pirate-djs-hackney-ofcom-council-crackdown/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political pirate radio==

===Left and Right Politics===
The first political radio station was [[Radio Free Scotland]], which illegally hijacked the sound channels of BBC television after [[closedown]]. At the time, the BBC forbade the [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] to broadcast. In the 1970s, [[Radio Enoch]], named after [[Enoch Powell]], was set up by people on the right wing of the [[Conservative and Unionist Party]] to help re-elect a conservative government. Although Radio Enoch had vowed to return if a Labour administration was re-elected, it failed to do so after [[Tony Blair]] was elected in 1997. In 1982, "Our Radio" was broadcasting music, anarchism, and other left wing views to London. Our Radio once evaded arrest by setting up a dummy antenna for the Home Office to find. Another political pirate was the Miners pirate radio station dubbed Radio Arthur by the media, which operated in the Nottinghamshire area during the 1984/1985 miners strike; downloads of some of its programmes are available on www.g0mrf.com. This station transmitted over the top of Radio Trent on both mediumwave using 3500 watts and VHF using 800 watts or more. Mentioned in a House of Lords debate in Hansard as Radio Scargill, it was stated that it had been actively pursued and closed down by the authorities; however this was incorrect and the people involved were never caught. Other recordings of Radio Arthur are on the Pirate Archive website. More recently, [[Interference FM]],&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVCR4SivV4s |title=Pirate Radio Report 2002. Channel 4 News |publisher=YouTube |date=16 December 2007 |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; set up by a collective to broadcast during the [[Carnival Against Capitalism]] demonstration on 18th June 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepiratearchive.net/interference/IFM-Magazine4.jpg Interference FM] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724101835/http://www.thepiratearchive.net/interference/IFM-Magazine4.jpg |date=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black Politics===
Other political stations include the likes of Galaxy Radio, founded in the early 1980s and gaining a strong audience by the late 80's after becoming consistent reliable station broadcasting mostly on Fridays, weekends and Monday mornings. Galaxy Radio did attempt to broadcast 24 hours on the FM briefly and did advertise for a short time, before returning to broadcasting mostly on Fridays, weekends and Monday mornings after 1992 with no profit making adverts. It was not until June 2012 Galaxy Radio attempted to broadcast 24 hours a day on the FM again and deliberately continued to not use profit making advertisements to maintain the station. However, in late September/early October 2012 due to constant attacks from the authorities the station decided to go back to its original schedule, this time with an additional day and a half of broadcasting per week; broadcasting on the FM from Thursday afternoons until Monday afternoons. Galaxy Radio encourages the black population to liberate themselves through empowerment and self-reliance.

In 2002, a project conducted by a team of The Evening Standard journalists quoted a presenter on Galaxy Radio saying 'black empowerment" against a system "designed to oppress our brothers and sisters".&lt;ref name="standard"&gt;{{cite web|author=David Rowan |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londons-underground-pirates-6308299.html |title=London's underground pirates |work=London Evening Standard |date=3 January 2002 |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In live phone-ins to mobile-phone numbers, listeners are urged to integrate "not with Europe, but with Africa", and warned against the "Freemasons and illuminati controlling the racist media".&lt;ref name="standard"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Galaxy Radio is known for quoting Marcus Garvey heavily and claims to be 'the only DE brainwashing station' and was and still is one of the few stations that does not run profit making adverts&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Philip Fergusson |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/media-pirates-remain-afloat-illegal-radio-stations-are-continuing-to-defy-tough-new-laws-says-philip-fergusson-1548817.html |title=Media: Pirates remain afloat: Illegal radio stations are continuing to defy tough new laws, says Philip Fergusson – Media  |work=The Independent |date=2 September 1992 |accessdate=15 August 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="standard"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein Genesis Radio founded in 1985 (broadcasting briefly, mainly playing music). Genesis Radio re-launched properly in 1991 and in latter years it began broadcasting 24 hours with various talk and information shows, often extremely politically engaging. One of the founder members of Genesis Radio is also the founder of the legendary Reggae Sound System Saxon Sound. The station suffered constant attacks by the authorities, but was still regularly on the FM. In 2005 Genesis Radio was one of the first pirate stations to go on the internet and became less consistent and unreliable on the FM, sometimes going months without being on the FM. Genesis Radio often used the slogan 'Black power station' and 'the people's station'. Like Galaxy Radio, many of the talk shows on Genesis Radio are very political and controversial discussions are dealt with.  In 2010, [[Lewisham]] [[Lib Dem]] Councillor [[Duwayne Brooks]], who was present when his friend [[Stephen Lawrence]] was killed by racists in 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sandra Laville  |author2=Vikram Dodd  |lastauthoramp=yes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/17/stephen-lawrence-friend-duwayne-brooks |title=Stephen Lawrence's best friend breaks down in court as he recalls attack  |work=The Guardian |date= 17 November 2011|accessdate=15 August 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; urged the police to engage with unlicensed stations such as Genesis Radio to help bring community cohesion and crack down on hard crime. Duwayne Brooks also mentioned growing up listening to Genesis Radio and described the station as a tool for people to have a platform to speak, where otherwise their voices are silenced or excluded.&lt;ref name="slpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southlondon-today.co.uk/news.cfm?id=33518|title= Lewisham councillor urges cops to use illegal pirate radio | publisher= South London Press| date=24 September 2010}} {{webarchive | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20101007015312/http://www.southlondon-today.co.uk/news.cfm?id=33518 | archivedate=7 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In article published by the Guardian newspaper, the community importance of pirate radio was highlighted. Sanjae a young girl at the age of 3 was told she had just weeks to live due to a rare lung tissue disease. It would require at least £50.000 to send Sanjae to the US to have a life or death operation. A weekly popular talk show entitled the 'Nubian Forum talk show' which took place on the now deceased radio station, Powerjam Radio raised awareness and began raising money. Within days two other pirate radio stations, Galaxy and Genesis Radio joined forces to help; both of which helped raise thousands of pounds each. With the exception of the Hackney Gazette, no other mainstream media was interested. It is therefore argued that had it not been for Powerjam, Galaxy and Genesis Radio, Sanjae would have died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Rowan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jan/13/race.world |title=Pirate radio station saves child's life &amp;#124; The Observer |work=The Guardian |date= 25 February 2002|accessdate=15 August 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the founder of DBC (Dread Broadcasting Corporation) considered to be the first black owned pirate station in Europe, Leroy Anderson described some of the present day pirate stations as a joke. He did however acknowledge stations that are doing good things and mentioned Genesis Radio as an example.&lt;ref name="ricenpeas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ricenpeas.com/docs/lepke.html |title=RICE N PEAS FILMS – Interview With Lepke |publisher=Ricenpeas.com |date=1 April 2007 |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal situation ==

The [[Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006]] provides for [[Ofcom]] to issue licences to radio broadcasters for the use of stations and wireless telegraphy apparatus. The Act sets out a number of criminal offences relating to wireless telegraphy, including the establishment or use of a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of making an unlicensed broadcast. The financing or participating in the day-to-day running of unlicensed broadcasting is also a criminal offence, as is the supplying of a sound recording for an unlicensed station and advertising through unlicensed stations.&lt;ref name="ofcom"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006]] allows [[Ofcom]] to take a number of actions against individuals committing these offences, including power of entry and search and seizure of equipment. It is a criminal offence to obstruct a person exercising enforcement powers on Ofcom's behalf.&lt;ref name="ofcom"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] provides that anyone convicted of an unlawful broadcasting offence is disqualified from holding a broadcasting licence for five years.&lt;ref name="ofcom"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Operators of non-licensed broadcasting face high fines and prison sentences. Licensed broadcasters may also take legal action against pirate radio stations. In 2000, the Commercial Radio Companies Association (CRCA) for the first time initiated legal action against a pirate station. The CRCA sued the weekend dance music pirate station Scene FM for £50,000 for causing interference to transmissions and a reduction in advertising revenues.&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural influences ==

=== Black music ===
Pirate radio stations played a major role in blurring reggae and soul in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1970 Radio Invicta, Europe's first Soul station began broadcasting from and to South London, for one hour Monday to Friday, as The Sound of Midnight Soul. These broadcasts were soon expanded to Bank Holidays, and then every Sunday on 92.4fm in Stereo. Radio Invicta launched the radio careers of Steve Marshall, Steve Walsh, [[Pete Tong]], Giles Peterson, and many others. The pirate radio station London Weekend Radio (LWR) became the home of hip hop and [[Tim Westwood]], who pioneered LWR, recruited members for the British chapter of the [[Universal Zulu Nation|Zulu Nation]] through the pirate radio station.  During that time, JFM, founded by former [[Radio Jackie]] DJ Brian Anthony, and Horizon FM broadcast soul and jazz-funk.&lt;ref name="cutnmix"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1981 in west London DBC ([[Dread Broadcasting Corporation]]) also known as Rebel Radio FM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ode47brQVLg |title=Pirate Radio in the 1980's (6) Dread Broadcasting Corporation |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered the first black owned pirate radio station in Europe.&lt;ref name="ricenpeas"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The West London-based DBC ([[Dread Broadcasting Corporation]]), founded by [[DJ Lepke]], played reggae on Friday nights in a format based on sound systems style and using heavy dub echo and reverb in the links. DBC also broadcast soul music, gospel, jazz, funk, r&amp;b, Afrikan (South African black music) and [[Soca music|soca]] (upbeat calypso). DBC was unique among radio stations in the UK at the time, a black-run station broadcasting black music to a mixed audience. Miss P, who would later DJ the first reggae show on [[BBC Radio 1]], commented: "There's never been a station run like DBC. Our format allows us to play music that would otherwise never be heard publicly. We create movement within the industry."&lt;ref name="cutnmix"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 80s/early 90s and throughout the 2000s, a number of black music pirate stations in London, including Station FM, Vibes FM, Powerjam, Lightning FM, Juice FM, RJR FM, Bassline FM, The Beat, Galaxy Radio, Unique, Genesis Radio, Conscious Radio, and Millennium Supreme have established a relatively stable presence on the airwaves. With the advent of [[internet radio]], these stations, particularly Genesis Radio have acquired a global audience, while still retaining their local flavor. One of the station managers from Genesis said: ''Our Sunday show gets 2,000 listeners from the internet alone so the radio can be an effective way of getting a message across.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lester Holloway, on 11 October 2010 at 10:05&amp;nbsp;am said: |url=http://operationblackvote.wordpress.com/2010/10/06/use-pirate-radio-to-catch-criminals-says-duwayne-brooks/ |title=Use Pirate radio to catch criminals says Duwayne Brooks &amp;#124; |publisher=Operationblackvote.wordpress.com |date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pirate radio stations, also gave birth to grime.

===Alternative Music===

There were a number of stations in London that played alternative rock and indie music that was not being catered for legally, including but not limited to RFL (Radio Free London) RFM (Rock FM) and London Rock. Rock FM broadcast on 94.3FM on Sundays and was regularly featured in listings magazines such as Time Out. London Rock broadcast on Saturdays from the London SE1 area and was in effect a sister station to RFM, though no less relevant for all that. RFM was founded by Dave Fuller and Claire Mansfield and soon established itself as one of the few voices on Pirate Radio that was not funded by or linked to the rave culture. RFM and London Rock took no advertising, but funded the stations themselves, a major difference with the MOBO Pirates who were funded by payola and the promotion of their own rave events. London Rock had DJ's such as Lucien, Dennis and Martin Richards. London Rock and RFM seemed to share DJ's for a while, and both stations operated took requests by phone and mail.

Indie pirate stations included notably [[Q102 (Pirate Station)|Q102]] (which eventually became [[XFM]] and that DJ Steve Lamacq started out on, and Radio Phoenix in London, and [[KFM Radio]] in Manchester. Playing indie rock, these stations broke bands such as Blur and The Happy Mondays. Although not as numerous as either the black or rave oriented stations, they did have a significant impact on the music industry.

'''Robert Bruce''' (3 November 1943 – 2 March 2009), born '''John Charles Young''', was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]]-born  [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and [[talent agent]] in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]].

==Biography==
Bruce was born in [[Musselburgh]], near [[Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]]. He was born John Charles Young, but adopted the stage name of Robert the Bruce, later shortened to Robert Bruce, and kept the name when he quit wrestling. In the ring he played the quintessential villain who prefaced every low blow with an evil smirk, once saying ''"Honestly, it's better being a bad guy. I suppose it's the underlying evil you may have. You get a lot more fun."''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Obituary in ''Dominion Post'' 5 March 2009 page B3&lt;/ref&gt;

He began wrestling in [[London]] in 1967, and toured the United Kingdom, South Africa, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, eventually settling in New Zealand in the 1970s after wrestling [[John da Silva]] there for the Commonwealth championship in 1972. He held the Commonwealth Heavyweight Title on and off over a five-year period, and wrestled for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (professional wrestling)|World Title]].&lt;ref name="nzh1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10559577 |title=Wrestler, acting agent Bruce dies aged 65 |date=2 March 2009 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972, he had a small role as one of the bouncers in the [[Korova Milk Bar]] in the film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''.&lt;ref name="tvnz"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/536641/2510175 |title=Acting fraternity shocked over death of Bruce |date=2 March 2009 |agency=[[Reuters]] |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce retired from wrestling due to injuries to his back and elbows,&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10559601"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10559601 |title=Robert Bruce: 'Bad guy' of wrestling spent his life helping others |author=Ihaka, James |date=3 March 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and decided to form a [[talent agency]] in 1978 when he realised that there was no such company in New Zealand. The Robert Bruce Agency was nicknamed the "Ugly Bruce" agency, as Bruce claimed his first clients were his former wrestling friends seeking roles as ugly people, thugs or stuntmen. His later clients included well-known New Zealand actors such as [[Cliff Curtis]], the late [[Kevin Smith (New Zealand actor)|Kevin Smith]], [[Robbie Magasiva]], [[Frankie Stevens]], [[Jackie Clarke]] and [[Temuera Morrison]].&lt;ref name="tvnz" /&gt; He operated out of a villa in suburban [[Grey Lynn]], and his word was his bond. The villa was distinguished by the word "Tobermory", in memory of the lighthouse on the Isle of Mull where his maternal grandfather was a lighthouse keeper, and where his ashes are to be spread.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 

In addition to representing several of New Zealand's top actors, Bruce worked as a stuntman and fight co-ordinator on several New Zealand films, television shows and theatical plays, working on 73 TV series, 39 films and 21 live shows,&lt;ref name="tvnz" /&gt; and as an actor played the role of a former international rugby player in the 1991 film ''[[Old Scores]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, H., &amp; Edwards, S. (1997) ''New Zealand film, 1912-1996.'' Auckland: Oxford University Press (NZ). p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; He was an animal lover, and was a [[Patronage|vice-patron]] of the [[Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]].&lt;ref name="ODT_45709"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/45709/wrestler-robert-bruce-dies |title=Wrestler Robert Bruce dies |date=2 March 2009 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[Otago Daily Times]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce died suddenly and unexpectedly after a short illness on 2 March 2009; his age at the time of his death was reported as unknown by some sources,&lt;ref name="nzh1" /&gt; although other sources say he was 65.&lt;ref name="nzh1"/&gt;
He is survived by his partner Gabriella Larkin, his elder sister Merle Frame, her husband Robert and their two children.  Robert had three daughters, the product of his first marriage to Jean Young, formally Gould. They married in London on 2 February 1963. He was then a Police Constable based in Union Road Station near Wandsworth. Their first daughter Laurie was born in July 1963 with the addition of twin daughters Donna and Julie three years later. They lived as a family in Police accommodation in Charlton South London until they separated and he left to start a new life in New Zealand with his new partner Lyn. He travelled the world with his wrestling and acting career and letters, birthday cards, photographs, etc. were exchanged between the children and Robert for a good few years.  His eldest daughter went to visit him in New Zealand in the late 80's where she met many of his friends and Lyn's family.

'''''Salad Fingers''''' is a British [[flash animation]] [[web series]] created by [[David Firth]] in July 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailycampus.com/2.7437/salad-fingers-stream-of-consciousness-entertains-viewers-1.1062606|title='Salad Fingers'' Stream Of Consciousness Entertains Viewers|last=Gaudino|first=Elena|date=8 December 2005|website=The Daily Campus|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708220417/http://www.dailycampus.com/2.7437/salad-fingers-stream-of-consciousness-entertains-viewers-1.1062606|archive-date=8 July 2011|dead-url=yes|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gained rapid web popularity, such that the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' ranked it among the "Top 10" pop culture phenomena for 2005.&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;"[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/12/25/PKGM6GB3BP1.DTL 2005 In Review: Pop Culture]." ''San Francisco Chronicle''. 25 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

10 Episodes (14 confirmed) have already been published on [[YouTube]] and [[Newgrounds]].

The cartoon revolves around the [[eponymous]] "Salad Fingers", a thin, green, mentally troubled being who inhabits a desolate world with three lifeless, scruffy finger puppets. The first seven episodes of ''Salad Fingers ''were shown back-to-back in Australia at the 2007 Sydney Underground Film Festival at the [[Factory Theatre]], along with a variety of other [[Animated films|animated]] [[short films]], during the "Re-Animation" session.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.suff.com.au/katherineberger/images/library/archives/2007program/2007program.pdf|title=Sydney Underground Film Festival 2007 Program|last=|first=|date=2007|website=The Sydney Underground Film Festival|publisher=|page=10|format=PDF|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Salad Fingers was first conceived as an [[in-joke]] when Firth was playing the guitar one day and his friend and frequent collaborator Christian Webb commented that he had "salad fingers," referring to the way Firth was playing the C chord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bing|title=David Firth – Heroes of Animation with Bing|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wARTupdJVW8&amp;t=1132|time=18:52|website=YouTube|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firth has cited the works of [[David Lynch]], ''[[South Park]]'', [[Tim Burton]], ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'' and [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] as sources of inspiration.&lt;ref name="semantikon" /&gt;  There are similarities between the novel ''[[Tideland]]'' by Mitch Cullin and the film ''[[Tideland (film)|Tideland]]'' by Terry Gilliam and ''Salad Fingers.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ferox.haxial.net/weblog/?p=1430|title=Salad Fingers vs Tideland|last=|first=|date=1 April 2007|website=FeroxLog|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723142658/http://www.ferox.haxial.net/weblog/?p=1430|archive-date=23 July 2011|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The eerie music featured in the background is the tune "Beware the Friendly Stranger" from the [[Boards of Canada]] album ''[[Geogaddi]]''. The dark music in the soundtrack that appears when Salad Fingers is scared is actually Firth playing the guitar, but slowed down and reversed. 

Other music included in ''Salad Fingers'' episodes includes work credited to [[Brian Eno]], [[Sigur Rós]], [[Aphex Twin]] (in particular, the track 'Rhubarb' from ''[[Selected Ambient Works Volume II]]'') and [[Lustmord]].&lt;ref name="semantikon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Salad Fingers Creator David Firth|url=http://www.semantikon.com/RESaladFingers.htm|website=Semantikon|accessdate=20 October 2016|date=August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Firth frequently inserts references to Aphex Twin in his flash cartoons; for example, the Aphex Twin logo can be found on the telephone in Salad Fingers [[#Episode 5 – Picnic|episode five]].

==Characters==
{{Original research section|date=January 2018}}
;Salad Fingers: The main character is a bald [[Kyphosis|hunchbacked]] humanoid figure with light-green skin and no visible nose or ears, who speaks with a distorted [[English language in England#Northern England|Northern English accent]]. His long, strangely-shaped fingers are his most notable feature, hence the name "Salad Fingers". They were the focus of the first episode of the series, where Salad Fingers is shown getting pleasure from rubbing various objects, particularly rusty metallic items such as spoons, a doorbell panel and a kettle (which he claims to be orgasmic). Salad Fingers is unable or unwilling to distinguish between living beings and inanimate objects, and is frequently found talking to various inert articles (notably his finger puppets and in two cases a human corpse). Furthermore, he often assigns such objects [[proper name]]s and appears to believe that they can communicate with him directly, sometimes voicing their perceived thoughts himself.

:He [[hermit|lives alone]] in a small shack with the number 22 on the door, containing, among other things, an oven, bedroom, a crawl space he calls the "safety cupboard", radio, phone, and table. Salad Fingers appears to be [[Autosadism|autosadistic]], as he can be seen taking pleasure from impaling his finger on a nail, rubbing [[Urtica dioica|stinging nettles]] on himself or inadvertently stepping onto a hidden bear trap. His talents include playing the [[flute]] and speaking French. He also seems able to use [[Morse code]], as shown in episode nine, where he must inform others of a strange illness he has (which he refers to as [[scarlet fever]]). He is quite articulate, however he often spouts peculiar English sayings and phrases in situations where they do not fit or even seem relevant. It is assumed that Salad Fingers lives in the [[UK]], due to his English accent and mentioning of real places in the UK such as [[Croxley Green]] and [[Cowdenbeath]].

:Salad Fingers takes up various habits, including a regular measurement of the distance between his house and a tree, tasting of the dirt ("floor-sugar"), and listening to his radio. Sometimes he also displays a raspy [[asthma]]tic-like breathing when he becomes mesmerized at something or experiences extreme pleasure. The name "Salad Fingers" was invented by Firth's co-writer, Christian "Crust" Webb, who described Firth as having salad fingers while playing the guitar.&lt;ref name="semantikon"/&gt;

:Despite living in a desolate place and having many eccentric features, Salad Fingers is likely not evil and does regularly come across as polite and good natured.

;Hubert Jason Cumberdale (Barbara Logan-Price), Marjory Stewart-Baxter, and Jeremy Fisher: Finger puppets who, after their introduction in episode 2, have only been missing in episode four of the series. They often appear in Salad Fingers' [[Fantasy|fantasies]] as life sized beings. Jeremy Fisher is thought to be named after the [[Beatrix Potter]] book ''[[The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.encyclopedia.livepress.com/index.php/Salad_Fingers#Characters|title=Salad Fingers|last=|first=|date=|website=LivePress Encyclopedia|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703022541/http://en.encyclopedia.livepress.com/index.php/Salad_Fingers#Characters|archive-date=3 July 2009|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In episode 2, Salad Fingers tastes these puppets, claiming Hubert Cumberdale tastes like "soot and poo" and Marjory Stewart-Baxter tastes like "sunshine dust". Jeremy Fisher is not tasted, which is revisited in a later episode. Salad Fingers has also referred to Jeremy Fisher as having been out fighting "The Great War". In episode five, Hubert Cumberdale is temporarily renamed Barbara Logan-Price (and given a "friend hat" which is actually a Navy cap). In episode six, Salad Fingers eats Jeremy Fisher in a moment of forgetfulness after accusing him of "tailgating his daughter", and the puppet has not appeared or been mentioned since, indicating that he was killed off (he was actually eating another clone of himself). In episode eight, Salad Fingers calls Cumberdale a "dirty immigrant" after dropping him in a chamber pot. In episode nine, Salad Fingers talks to Stewart-Baxter as if she is his partner and the mother of their "child", Yvonne.

;Harry/Milford Cubicle: Appearing in [[#Episode 3 – Nettles|episode three]], Cubicle is an aggressive, armless human mutant who wears an apron identifying him as being employed at a "BBQ". Though his name tag reads "Harry" and indicates that he is "Happy to help", Salad Fingers calls him Milford Cubicle. He bleeds to death after repeatedly banging his head on Salad Fingers' door. Salad Fingers then finds him and drags him inside his house and hangs him on a meat hook, believing him to be alive and conscious. He is seen to have the flesh torn from his body (or possibly rotted away due to the length of time his corpse has been hanging) in Episode 10 and finally ends that episode as a skeleton, his flesh turned into a hat which was given as a gift to Salad Fingers.

;Bordois: Appearing in [[#Episode 4 – Cage|episode four]], Bordois is a [[woodlouse]] which Salad Fingers accidentally kills by attempting to pet her. Although he refers to her as "little sister", Salad Fingers makes sexual remarks to Bordois, saying "Your body is so much fun." Once he squishes her, he says "You've gone flat, little sister. And you're all gooey. I shan't play with you again until you've had a wash."

;Aunty Bainbridge: Appearing in [[#Episode 1 – Spoons|episode one]] and [[#Episode 9 – Letter|episode nine]], is a yellow bug-eyed person with a green shirt who owns many rusty objects (which Salad Fingers strokes) and a small house. While Salad Fingers calls it Aunty Bainbridge in the ninth episode, he also calls it a "young child" in the first, indicating that he does not, in fact, know it at all. This is further evidenced when it backs away from Salad Fingers when he tries to hug it in the ninth episode. The only sound it makes is a sharp scream, so it is difficult to tell whether this is a person and what its gender is.

;Mable: Appearing in episode five, Mable is a scuffed, grubby, scarred young girl who goes to a picnic with Salad Fingers. She is the first character other than Salad Fingers who can communicate in English, and she is the first person other than Salad Fingers to actually speak— something that seems to shock and dismay Salad Fingers. When she sees Salad Fingers looking at her in shock, she asks "What's wrong?", and subsequently Salad Fingers is shown hallucinating her with her eyes gouged out asking him, "What's wrong, Mr. Fingers? Do you not like my mouth-words?"

;Tony: A big-eyed, grotesque, small mutant creature who falls in love with Salad Fingers in episode four. It has a large stitch across its forehead, and as such, many refer to it as "Stitch-head". This character was originally created by Jimi Hollis, who refers to it as the "bug-eyed kid".{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} It uses a bear trap and a grubby tap to capture Salad Fingers, then cages him and proposes with a ring topped with a human [[molar (tooth)|molar]].

;Kenneth: Kenneth is a bisected rotting human corpse which salad fingers addresses as his younger brother. Salad finds him in a ditch and says, "Back from the great war Kenneth."

;Roger: Appearing in episode eight, Roger is a broken radio that speaks in a robotic, aggressive manner (much like a [[Dalek]]) and scares Salad Fingers into the cupboard twice. Roger, according to Salad Fingers, must be given 'sustenance' (in the form of small brown pellets which appear to be beans, BBs, or marbles). This distress caused by his radio has him eating his hair collection.

;[[Horace Horsecollar]]: A toy horse with which Salad Fingers indulges his senses. Possibly the inspiration of the horse that gets savaged in Episode 10.

;Penny Pigtails: A character Salad Fingers' imagination created while hiding from Roger in the safety cupboard. She is nothing but Salad Fingers' hand "walking" across the ledge. Salad Fingers imagines that she is denied raspberry jam by a market trader, who bases his actions on the grounds that her legs are "too long" and "made of cotton", which upsets him greatly.

;Mr. Branches: A tree 21 yards from the house. Salad Fingers measures this distance, and then comments to the tree that it's "barely shuffled an inch all week"&amp;nbsp;— implying that it moves (or, at least, he perceives it to) and that he regularly keeps track of this measurement. In [[#Episode 9 – Letter|episode nine]], Salad Fingers bites one of its branches, causing it to cry in pain (with Salad Fingers imagining it with a face). It begs Salad Fingers to be let inside in the voice of a young child, but is told that it has to "grow out of [its] branches" first. Mr. Branches then proceeds to tightly wrap its branch around Salad Fingers' stomach&amp;nbsp;— although, it is implied that this entire scene was a fantasy, and not reality.

;Yvonne: A black slimy object that Salad Fingers "gives birth to" out of the front of his stomach in [[#Episode 9 – Letter|episode nine]]. The object may be a tumour that has caused Salad Fingers sickness as he feels better after 'giving birth' to her. She is implied that she is his long-awaited child, saying that he "yearned for [the] day" she would arrive. He cradles her and reads her a poem, during which he names it "Baby Yvonne" and tells it that it has its mother's eyes, when in fact it has no human features at all. Unhappy with it, Salad Fingers decides to give it to Aunty Bainbridge, but ends up forgetting that it's his daughter. He then proceeds to clean Aunty Bainbridge's window, believing it to be a sponge. After "washing" the window (when in fact he actually leaves it dirtier than before by covering it with black residue), Salad Fingers takes a "lunch break" and is seen eating a large submarine sandwich with a coffee cup nearby.

;Dr. Papanak: A puppet Salad Fingers finds in some rubbish in Episode 10, over which he has considerably less control than any other puppet. He is seen (if only in Salad Fingers' mind) to sprout knives and slaughter a horse.

;Unnamed characters:
* A young, relatively normal-looking child, wearing a varsity-type jacket whom Salad Fingers appears to have cooked in an oven in [[#Episode 2 – Friends|episode two]].
* Salad Fingers has a crow "visit" for his picnic. Salad Fingers also ramblingly mentions he has an "old pal" named "Charlie" as well as a daughter, though neither of them are seen. It could be that neither of these characters are real or may have died in the supposed "[[Great War]]".
* Many humanoids resembling Salad Fingers, but with a unique face deformity. They all appear in [[#Episode 10 - Birthday|episode ten]] where they attend Hubert Cumberdale’s Birthday.

==Episodes==
Each episode is 2–10 minutes long. The narratives themselves are quite [[oneiric (film theory)|oneiric]], have almost all spoken dialogue transcribed with on-screen squiggly text, and disjointed plot structures.

===Episode 1 – Spoons===
*'''Release date''': 9 May 2004
*'''Credits''': Drawn, animated and voiced by David Firth. Written by David Firth and Christian "Crust" Pickup. Music by [[Boards of Canada]] (in particular, the song "Beware the Friendly Stranger")

This episode introduces Salad Fingers and his love of touching rusty spoons and other various rusty objects. He explains how touching any form of rust—including spoons, a door bell panel, and a kettle—stimulates him ("''The feeling of rust against my salad fingers is almost [[orgasm]]ic''"), and that he holds a particular love of spoons. Salad Fingers walks to the house of a strange young boy to see if he has any rusty spoons; the child screeches two times, at which point Salad Fingers leaves, after asking to caress a rusty kettle that is on a table beside him.

===Episode 2 – Friends===
*'''Release date''': 15 July 2004
*'''Credits''': Drawn, animated and voiced by David Firth. Written by David Firth and Christian "Crust" Pickup. Music by [[Boards of Canada]] and David Firth.

Salad Fingers has a get-together with his "friends"—finger puppets—whom Salad Fingers introduces as Hubert Cumberdale, Marjory Stewart-Baxter and Jeremy Fisher. He appears to believe that his "friends" are real, living beings. Wondering what his friends taste like, he briefly inserts them into his mouth, exclaiming that Marjory Stewart-Baxter tastes like "sunshine dust", while Hubert Cumberdale tastes like "soot and poo". Salad Fingers then tells them that he has a fish cooking in the oven and speaks a nonsensical phrase in French: "Allô Nabilah, Comment t'appelles-tu? Qu'est-ce qu'il y a?" This roughly translates to: "Hello Nabilah, What's your name? What's up (or What's the matter)?" (Nabilah is a popular first name in Algeria).
In the next scene, a frightened child responds to Salad Fingers's call for help. Salad Fingers cannot reach the fish cooking in his oven and asks the child to get it for him. As the child reaches into the oven, Salad Fingers sees a rusty nail jutting out of the wall and reaches to caress it, causing the oven door to close with the child still inside. Salad Fingers then impales his finger on the spike and begins bleeding, blissfully saying "I like it when the red water comes out."

Salad Fingers turns pale and passes out. Apparently dreaming, Salad Fingers walks through a large [[meat locker]] singing "[[Somewhere Over the Rainbow]]" to himself. While inside, he meets a full-size Hubert Cumberdale, who screams a distorted electronic noise at him. When Salad Fingers awakens he sits in a pool of his own blood. The oven smokes as Salad Fingers states, "That fish smells about done," presumably forgetting the fact that it was the smoke from the child trapped in the oven that he'd forgotten about when 'dozing off'.

===Episode 3 – Nettles===
*'''Release date''': 1 August 2004
*'''Credits''': Drawn, animated and voiced by David Firth. Written by David Firth and Christian "Crust" Pickup. Music by [[Boards of Canada]], Brian Eno and a yoga flute.

Salad Fingers is playing with [[Stinging nettle|nettles]] and has irritated blisters all over his hands. He then comes across an empty [[Baby transport|perambulator]], which he refers to as a "nettle carrier" and then leaves with it. A deformed armless man wearing an apron labelled "BBQ" appears and chases after Salad Fingers, screaming and babbling unintelligibly. Salad Fingers is sitting on the floor at his home and brushing the nettle over his nipple, which makes him lactate, and says "It seems... Nettles... have made the milk... drop out... from inside my teat!", when the armless man runs to Salad Fingers' house and begins to bang his head on the door. Salad Fingers daydreams of "happy times" (in which he and a life-sized version of the Hubert Cumberdale puppet are getting hair-dried). Eventually, Salad Fingers comes outside and finds the man dead on the floor, his head bloodied. He names the man "Milford Cubicle", despite the man's name tag reading "Harry". Believing that the man is alive, Salad Fingers drags "Milford" inside and hangs him on a meat hook on the wall. Salad Fingers then plays a merry tune on the flute, showing odd dexterity for having his hand covered in nettle sores. He then offers "Milford" a "warm glass of milk", which presumably is the milk that came out of his teat when he milked himself using the nettles.

===Episode 4 – Cage===
*'''Release date''': 20 August 2004
*'''Credits''': Drawn, animated and voiced by David Firth. Written by David Firth, Christian "Crust" Pickup, and Jimi Mwng. Additional character design by Jimi Mwng. Music by [[Boards of Canada]], [[Aphex Twin]] and [[David Firth]].

Salad Fingers wears a [[beret]] and declares that he is going to try to find France. However, he is oddly frightened by a mutated boy with disproportionately large eyeballs that has been "watching him for a while". Salad Fingers becomes uncomfortable with the child's proximity and begins to leave. The boy, who speaks only in growls and grunts, approaches Salad Fingers, having apparently fallen in love with him. Salad Fingers holds out his hand to stop the boy coming closer, but the boy licks his hand, much to Salad Fingers' disgust and fear.
Inside his house, Salad Fingers sees a grey [[woodlouse]] coming out from a hole in the wall. He addresses the bug as "Bordois" and his "little sister". After asking what "she" has been collecting, he acts as though the bug gives him a response. Salad Fingers announces his enjoyment in the bug's body and goes to touch it, accidentally crushing it and looking at it in curiosity which turns to disgust. He then says to Bordois that she's "gone flat" and become "all gooey", and that he "shalln't play with [her] again, until [she's] had a wash."  Salad Fingers then hears a knock on the door, which he opens to find a "grubby [[Tap (valve)|tap]]" attached to a string on the ground. Salad Fingers becomes excited about this "gift" and begins to fantasize about taps. He attempts to fetch it, but it is drawn away on the string as bait. He is caught in a [[Trapping (Animal)#Foothold traps or Leghold traps|bear trap]] which causes him to lose blood and consciousness while savouring the [[Bleeding|desanguination]] blissfully. He wakes up in a cage, and enjoys rubbing the rusted bars. The grotesque boy approaches the cage and holds out a ring (on which is mounted a human [[tooth]]) as if proposing marriage. Salad Fingers becomes distraught, states "I don't like this game" and announces that he is "going home now". This angers the boy, who makes an unintelligible noise that sounds like "You're my wife now." A rope appears, hanging down from the ceiling, which Salad Fingers pulls to draw down a curtain. When the curtain lifts, the boy, seeing that Salad Fingers has disappeared, begins to cry. The episode closes with Salad Fingers, wearing his beret, flying away gleefully on a giant tap, presumably to France.

===Episode 5 – Picnic===
*'''Release date''': 25 November 2004
*'''Credits''': Designed, animated, voiced and written by [[David Firth]]. Additional writing and the voice of Mable by Christian "Crust" Pickup (who also plays MC Devvo). Music by [[Boards of Canada]], [[Aphex Twin]] and [[David Firth]].

Salad Fingers talks to an apparently broken and disconnected phone, asking the [[Switchboard operator|operator]] to connect him to his "old pal Charlie" so he can invite him to a picnic, but only garbled noises are heard. Whilst describing the picnic fare, Salad Fingers rubs his stomach in hunger, then claims to have been rudely disconnected. Hubert Cumberdale is on one of the fingers on Salad Fingers' other hand, but he seems dismayed to see him. Instead of referring to him as Hubert, he calls him "Barbara Logan-Price", and gives him a "friend-hat", which is a miniature captain's hat.

In the next scene, Salad Fingers wears a [[wedding dress|bridal train]] and talks to himself in a mirror, declaring "You look so beautiful" with Rhubarb by Aphex Twin playing in the background. He then goes outside for his picnic, which is attended by a strange crow (which appears in other David Firth cartoons) that makes garbled noises and a little girl with scars on her face, a filthy, stained pink dress and orange hair. Salad Fingers asks the orange-haired girl a question and answers it for her (as he seems to think that only he can speak), ending with "replied Mable". Salad Fingers calls her his new playmate and compliments her on her dress, and as he does this, Marjory Stewart-Baxter is seen in the window, jealous. Salad Fingers offers "Mable" some "[[Pease Pudding]]", which he feeds to her with a dirty, rusty spoon. The crow then swoops down and steals Salad Fingers's spoon.

Salad Fingers and the little girl giggle and she says that the crow must like spoons too. The shock of the girl speaking to him, thus meaning the girl is indeed real, not a figment of his imagination, drives Salad Fingers to temporary insanity, hallucinating, hearing screeching, distorted noises, and seeing the girl (complete with empty eye sockets in front of a vortex) saying, "What's wrong, Mr. Fingers?  Do you not like my mouth-words? Naughty mouth".

===Episode 6 – Present===
*'''Release date''': 24 July 2005 	
*'''Credits''': Drawn, animated and voiced by David Firth. Written by David Firth and Christian "Crust" Pickup. Music by [[Boards of Canada]], [[Chris Gladwin]] and [[David Firth]].

The episode begins with Salad Fingers walking about his house. He sees Hubert Cumberdale on top of a cupboard, and instructs the finger puppet to come down at once. Hubert turns into a black, viscous, and apparently caustic fluid and oozes down the cupboard. A [[silhouette]] is then seen walking through the house and Salad Fingers asks if somebody is there; it is, in fact, the Jeremy Fisher puppet on his finger. Salad Fingers remarks that he thought Jeremy was out "fighting the Great War". Jeremy Fisher/Salad Fingers responds in garbled gibberish which Fingers can't understand, musing that Fisher seems "to have adopted a strange dialect."

Another perspective shot shows Jeremy Fisher (now with arms) handing Salad Fingers a toy horse. Salad Fingers is pleased with the [[Gift|present]], and remarks on the pleasing texture. He then eats Jeremy Fisher and immediately forgets, wondering "Where have you gotten to?" He begins to play with the toy horse while making "neigh" sounds, walks outside with it, and goes to an abandoned toilet with which he initiates a conversation. Suddenly, the mood changes and the music becomes sinister; he grows concerned and he begins defending himself, saying "You've got the wrong bloke, [[squire]]." He then flushes the toilet to "wash those bad thoughts away".

Upon arriving home, Salad Fingers gasps and sees himself sitting inside. The Salad Fingers inside appears to be [[hallucination|hallucinating]], seeing the "outside" Salad Fingers as a life-size Jeremy Fisher. The "inside" Salad Fingers speaks in a slightly different voice and also has rougher text showing what he is saying. The conversation starts off just like the earlier one with Jeremy Fisher, but goes on to include accusations that Jeremy Fisher has been "tailgating [his] daughter with aspirations of [[Virginity#Loss of virginity|deflowering her rose]]". This appears to be the other "side" of the conversation Salad Fingers had into the toilet.

The inside Salad Fingers is now seen with the Jeremy Fisher finger puppet. Fisher never responds verbally, but at one point unfastens a clasp over his mouth from which green ooze bubbles and drips to the floor. Salad Fingers caresses Fisher's hair and remarks that he never did "sample the delights of your flavor", a reference to when he tasted his other two "friends" Hubert Cumberdale and Marjory Stewart-Baxter in episode two. He begins putting the finger-puppet in his mouth, but the scene quickly changes to a bloody scene of the "inside" Salad Fingers eating the "outside" Salad Fingers' head/brains, suggesting that Salad Fingers is actually [[Dissociative identity disorder|experiencing the personalities he invents]]. The episode ends with an external shot of the house panning back to reveal the toilet, possibly implying a sinister connection, or past trauma involving the fixture.

===Episode 7 – Shore Leave===
*'''Release date''': 28 January 2006
*'''Credits''': Drawn, animated and voiced by David Firth. Written by David Firth, Christian Pickup and Jimi Mwng. Music by [[Boards of Canada]], [[Chris Gladwin]] and [[Brian Eno]].

As Salad Fingers is digging holes outside with his finger puppets, occasionally tasting the sand (which he calls "floor sugar"), he finds the decomposing torso of an old [[Dead body|corpse]]. Salad Fingers immediately "recognizes" the cadaver as "Kenneth," his "younger brother" who is back from the previously mentioned "Great War" on shore leave. Salad Fingers pulls the gruesome, dismembered corpse out of the hole, saying it was rude of him to leave for "the Great War" without him, but promises to draw him a hot [[bathing|bath]].

The next scene shows Salad Fingers turning a [[Sprocket|cog]] which pulls a clothesline, drawing Kenneth out of a wardrobe, now dressed in a white [[Black tie|dinner jacket]]. He starts to talk about life with the women of the great war. Salad Fingers has prepared a dinner of [[sand]] for his guest, saying "I—hope you like... ''SAND''". At one point Kenneth slumps forward, prompting Salad Fingers to suppose that he's sleepy and props Kenneth up by inserting a "wooden dent-rail" into his empty socket. He also spills some tea, which resembles the black caustic goo from the previous episode, on Kenneth's hand. Salad Fingers tells Kenneth of his life, keeping busy with "every shift I can... [and] sing[ing] at all the functions". There is a [[Flashback (literary technique)|flashback]] in which Salad Fingers measures the distance from his door to a tree named "Mr. Branches" with a [[Surveyor's wheel|clickwheel]] and subsequently teases it for its slow movement.

It is now evening, and Salad Fingers is with Kenneth outside near the same hole he found him in. He cries over the fact that Kenneth has to go "back to the [[trench warfare|ghastly trenches]]". He [[salute]]s Kenneth and sings "[[We'll Meet Again (song)|We'll Meet Again]]" for him, after exclaiming, somewhat futilely, "I only ask that our creator return you unspoilt from the cruel hand of war". He then kicks Kenneth back into the hole. A dream-like sequence follows in which Salad Fingers sings the same song, in a white dress, on a stage in front of an audience of a theatre. After singing a few strains, he complains to the pianist&amp;nbsp;– who is shown as the [[silhouette]] of a [[marionette]], with strings attached&amp;nbsp;– that the key is wrong, walks off the stage, and the screen fades to black.

In this episode Salad Fingers mentions the Scottish town of [[Cowdenbeath]], indicating he is aware of real-life places.

===Episode 8 – Cupboard===
*'''Release date''': 22 September 2007
*'''Credits''': Drawn, animated and voiced by David Firth. Written by David Firth and Christian "Crust" Pickup. Music by [[Boards of Canada]], [[Lustmord]] and dyzv0r

Salad Fingers is sitting in his armchair, trying to tune his radio which he calls "Roger." If he is lucky, Salad Fingers says he may chance upon a broadcast from "Croxley", which so happens to be a small town in Hertfordshire. "Croxleyheath" also occurs in Shore Leave. After feeding Roger his "sustenance" (which seems to be marbles, peas, rocks or beans), it begins to emit a strange, piercing frequency. A gurgling sound comes from Salad Fingers' own stomach, insinuating upset in reaction to the "unpleasant frequencies" coming from the radio. He decides to wait out the tormenting event in his "safety cupboard."

When in the cupboard, Salad Fingers begins to converse with his hands. One hand enacts "Penny Pigtails," the other a market vendor. The "market vendor" refuses to sell [[raspberry]] [[jam]] to "Penny Pigtails" on the grounds that her legs are "made of cotton" and "far too long" (an event that Salad Fingers finds most upsetting). After Salad Fingers cries for a bit, "Penny Pigtails" discovers a long strand of hair, which Salad Fingers rubs over his eyeball, apparently causing him great pleasure although it makes his eye red and inflamed. After emerging from the cupboard, he tapes the hair to a wall with four other hairs of assorted colours that he has collected. Salad Fingers speaks to the hairs, calling them "beautiple" and "a gay little quintette". Next, he goes to bed with the Hubert Cumberdale puppet. Before going to sleep, Salad Fingers sings "Three in the Bed," and instructs Hubert Cumberdale to "roll over"; as a result, the finger puppet is sent off the bed into a bowl of a filthy, brown substance (likely a [[chamberpot]]). Salad Fingers orders Hubert Cumberdale to "scrub that muck off at once!" as he doesn't want any "dirty immigrants" in his house.

Later that night, the radio begins to emit strange sounds again and wakes up Salad Fingers. Salad Fingers approaches it warily and threatens Roger with expulsion from the house. The radio replies it was rude of Salad to take his hair. The radio speaks in a static voice, instructing Salad Fingers to return its hair, as well as to tidy the house. Salad Fingers declares that he "shan't, can't and won't", on the grounds that it isn't "his turn" and that it is an extremely unpleasant job. The radio continues to torment him, causing him to eat all of the hairs from his quintet, tape and all, and return to his cupboard in tears.

===Episode 9 – Letter===
*'''Release date''': 26 May 2011&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/DAVID_FIRTH/status/73577093568536576 David Firth's Twitter] . 26 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Credits''': Drawn, animated and voiced by David Firth. Written by David Firth and Christian "Crust" Pickup. Music by Markus Fjellström.

Salad Fingers is holding a piece of torn newspaper, imagining it is a letter from the Great War (presumably from his "brother") and reading it aloud to himself. As he reads, a tentacle-like branch snakes in through the door to Salad Fingers' bedroom. Salad Fingers picks up the branch and bites off the tip, resulting in something sobbing "Daddy, that really hurt!" off-screen. Salad Fingers goes to the window and sees the branch-tentacle being retracted into the tree outside. He walks out to the tree, calling it "Mr. Branches" and has a conversation with it about its injury, apparently forgetting it was he himself that bit it. The tree cries, calling Salad Fingers "Daddy" and asking to be let inside, but Salad Fingers refuses until it "grows out of those branches". The tree wraps a branch around Salad Fingers' waist (it is slightly implied that the tree rapes him).

Salad Fingers wakes up in his room, very pale and his stomach growling. Salad Fingers worries that he may be dying and taps out an S.O.S. on the metal fire grate beside him. Suddenly a strange gooey black mass bursts out of his stomach, causing him to pass out. This mass, and the goo that surrounds Salad Fingers on a puddle on his bed, bears a strong resemblance to the 'tea' in 'Shore Leave', and the goo that Hubert Cumberdale turns into in 'Present'.

When he wakes up, he is overjoyed, and believes he has given birth to a daughter whom he names Yvonne. Sitting in a wheelchair and appearing to feel better despite his wound, he pulls back the skin of one finger revealing a strange solid tip and dips it in ink to write a "letter," or at least what he thinks is one, since he reads it aloud, consisting only of scribbles. It says he cannot attend the Great War as he is still feeling "under the weather". He keeps Yvonne (which appears to be wrapped in a bundle of newspapers) down in a pit and tells her off for not doing her exercises. When Yvonne refuses to respond to Salad Fingers' coaching, he addresses Marjory Stewart-Baxter, expressing his disappointment in 'their' child.

The scene then switches back to Salad Fingers lying on the floor, pale, with his stomach still wounded, and seems to be pumping air into his chest, suggesting that he's relapsed into illness. He tells Yvonne he may be too ill to care for her and speaks for her as he usually does for his other inanimate characters, saying "That's a shame; you were doing a first-rate job". He then taps another message on the fire grate, requesting a home for "a meddlesome child".

Salad Fingers is then outside in his wheelchair with Yvonne in a bucket, looking healthier once again, telling her that "good old Aunty Bainbridge" has agreed to look after her. He arrives at the house from [[#Episode 1 – Spoons|episode 1]], where the small, yellow-skinned human-like creature with big eyes lives. Salad Fingers refers to the creature as "Aunty Bainbridge" and asks for a hug, but the creature takes a step back and makes an odd wailing noise, as it did in 'spoons'. Salad Fingers recalls some memories of Aunty Bainbridge "all in faded days".

Salad Fingers then appears to forget his reason for visiting, and, noticing the bucket of black ooze on his lap, claims he has come to clean the windows, apparently forgetting who/what Yvonne is. Using the bundle/Yvonne, he smears the windows with black ooze as the yellow creature looks on. Job done, Salad Fingers begins to eat a sandwich, while Aunty Bainbridge returns to the house.

===Episode 10 – Birthday===
*'''Release date''': 24 November 2013
*'''Credits''': Written, drawn, animated and voiced by David Firth with additional attribution to Christian Webb and Jimlad Hollis

Salad Fingers is making preparations for Hubert Cumberdale's birthday. He addresses "Milford Cubicle", still hanging from the meat hook he was placed upon in Episode 3, trying to persuade the now heavily decayed corpse to take a bath for Hubert Cumberdale's birthday. A knock on the door leads Salad Fingers outside, only to encounter a long, thick metal pole stretching upwards further than the eye can see.  Perplexed and irritated by the pole, which he attempts to question, he goes back indoors and causes Milford to fall from his hook while berating him.  He reveals the ability to widen his irises and cause his teeth to move, making a music box-like tune, by moving his hand at the side of his head as though turning a handle.  When this fails to rouse his lifeless friend, he decides to leave the house, leaving "Horace Horsecollar", the toy horse that appeared in Episode 6, "in charge".

The scene cuts to Salad Fingers walking through a misty forest full of leafless trees, revealing the search for a doctor as his motive to Hubert Cumberdale.  He finds a vessel, perhaps a [[skip (container)|skip]]  or broken pram, full of rubbish and starts rummaging around inside it.  He finds a grotesque doctor puppet, which is self-animated and growling with gnashing teeth, that has bent hooks and springs for hands. He refers to the puppet as "Dr. Papanak", and lies down on a large slab resembling a tombstone for an examination (seemingly forgetting that the doctor was meant to examine "Milford Cubicle"). Salad Fingers initially seeming to relish the examination, until Dr. Papanak bites into the side of his head.  He throws the puppet away in fear, only for it to sprouts knives and latch onto a nearby horse closely resembling "Horace Horsecollar".  Dr. Papanak tears away savagely at the horse's side.  Salad Fingers's fear fades away on seeing this; he tries to comfort the horse, acknowledging that the doctor is hurting it, but tells it to try and be still whilst the doctor eats its blood. The horse is shown weeping a tear down its face but makes no movement or resistance.

The scene fades out, and returns to Salad Fingers, awake and still lying on the tombstone. The forest is now leafy, and an entire new tree has sprouted up through a crack in the slab between Salad Finger's legs. Salad Fingers looks older, is unshaven, and his clothes are partially torn and muddied. He speculates that he has been asleep "for six Mondays".  There is no sign of the horse or of Dr. Papanak, although Hubert Cumberdale is seen lying on the ground, also peculiarly aged, and surrounded by twigs.  Salad Fingers returns home (the great pole is missing) to find multiple horses in his house, including one that resembles the horse attacked by Dr. Papanak and which has had its wound patched shut. Accusing his toy horse Horace of inviting too many guests, he searches through his cupboards and drawers to find many horses improbably crammed in, and is distressed to discover Milford Cubicle as a skeleton.  He drives the horses out, imagining them to have eaten him, only to encounter the mysterious pole he had seen earlier outside his house has returned.

While accusing the pole of being involved in the previous events, Salad Fingers loses focus when he spots, a little way away from him, a group of people gathered around a table. Referring to them as "the whole platoon" (another ambiguous war reference), he approaches to reveal that each of the five guests is a deformed version of himself (not looking aged and unshaven as he does), each eating brains and bodily organs while groaning or performing repetitive and deranged actions.  At this point, he appears to forget that the party was for Hubert, and nervously assumes the birthday seat for himself.  Suddenly, the pole lowers itself into the ground to reveal a wrapped up present on the top of it, which he excitedly unwraps; only one of the clone-guests looks at him while he does this. He opens the present and finds a hat made from what is clearly Milford Cubicle. His BBQ apron, face, and skin can be clearly seen on it. He says "I shall wear it from here to the grave. What a truly special day." He puts it on while atmospheric music plays. The camera then begins to zoom back, until the screen slowly fades to black.

'''Notes''':  On 28 June 2013 Firth posted on his site Fat-Pie that a "brand new episode of Salad Fingers" would become available upon listening to the latest episode of his audio sketch ''Waller FM''.

Several YouTubers developed extensive theories in an attempt to decipher the potential hidden meanings and symbolics in the series, including [[The Film Theorists]] in a two-part video&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Film Theorists|title=Film Theory: The HORRIFIC Story of Salad Fingers|date=2016-10-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-J9UhqwHfQ|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Film Theorists|title=Film Theory: ENDING The Salad Fingers Mystery|date=2016-10-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCTTeql6V-A|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, CP Games&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=CP Games|title=Salad Fingers (1-10) Theory|date=2015-12-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i63Vv9JQcg|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and ReignBot&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ReignBot|title=Salad Fingers: Explained|date=2017-12-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=816pbPJTAoo|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

==Future episodes &amp; Revival==
In 2017, David Firth said that he was working on a brand new Salad Fingers episode, and that after finishing it he might also revive the series [[Burnt Face Man]].  He discussed the upcoming episode with YouTube channel Underground RT in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rattansi|first1=Afshin|title=Salad Fingers’ Creator on Fake News &amp; Power of Political Satire|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKcyYbEJC9g|website=YouTube|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, he posted on his [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] pages that Salad fingers was not over, and set up a [[Patreon]] account to enable people to support his work.

In November 23 2018, it was announced that Salad Fingers would be released on November 30.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3383">'''''Stella Inquisitorus''''' ("Star Inquisitor") is a [[science fiction]] "[[space opera]]" sequel to the French supernatural role-playing game ''[[In Nomine Satanis / Magna Veritas]]''. It was written by [[Croc (game designer)|Croc]] and published in 1993 by [[Siroz Productions|Siroz]]. 

Characters play Angels, Demons, or pagan Space Vikings. ''Stella Inquisitorus'' uses, and is compatible with, the Second Edition of the ''In Nomine Satanis / Magna Veritas'' rules.

==Plot overview==
The plot is set 5,000 years into the future in the year 6993 [[Anno Domini|AD]]. At the dawn of the 21st century, God and Lucifer ended the Great Game and revealed their existence. This triggered Armageddon. Both factions began fighting openly, demanding that humans choose their side or die. A faction of pagan humans, the Vikings, rejected both sides and sought a glorious death in heroic combat. Earth became a radioactive wasteland after the Catholic Fleet bombarded it from orbit to defeat the Antichrist.    

Later, faster-than-light travel by passing through Paradise or Hell was discovered, opening up space to colonization. Technology is banned or controlled.   

God formed the militantly Catholic ''Stella Vaticanum'' ("Star Vatican"), an empire that covers half of existing space. The masses under His protection are ruthlessly monitored by the Inquisition. Any sign of heresy or Demonic corruption in a subject planet's population is punishable by genocide. The other half is controlled by the satanic ''Dunkle Reik'' ("Dark Empire"). Each subjugated planet is ruled by a Demon Lord viceroy who has moulded it to fit the incarnation of their Demon Prince's Word. The Demons harvest their subjects' souls to power their weapons and starships.

==Accessories==
*'''Gamemaster's Screen''' [1993]: A four-panel gamemaster's screen. It comes with a 16-page booklet containing a beginning scenario. It also includes stats for 6 Angelic starships, 6 Demonic starships, and 6 Viking starships. 
*'''Stella Incognita''' [1993]: The space travel and space exploration sourcebook. Details the ''Stellae Incognitae'' ("Hidden Stars" - lost solar systems forgotten by both the ''Stella Vaticanum'' and ''Dunkle Reik'') and the Independent Federations (isolated planets within ''Stella Vaticanum'' space). Includes a chapter on astronomy and rules for world creation.  
*'''Strychnine IV''' [1993]: Details an entire solar system of four planets. There are five scenarios (2 Angelic, 2 Demonic and one that could be used for either - or both - sides). The first four concern each planet: the hotly contested farm planet of Haven I (now a sea of radioactive glass), the hostile jungle world of Virus II (where technology mysteriously malfunctions and the plant life is the apex predator), the fortified ice world of Cryo III (held by a fanatic Viking army against all comers) and the polluted industrial warzone world of Strychnine IV (where the seas are pure corrosive poison). The fifth scenario concerns a battle inside the besieged hulk of the ''Hellraiser'' - a powerful ''Dunkle Reik'' space battleship that would disrupt the balance of power should it escape.

==Background==
Writer J. Michael Straczynski said the project was a dream come true, as writing Superman was among his plans which also included ''[[Babylon 5]]''. Two years before its publication, Straczynski announced he had signed a contract with DC Comics. Before Straczynski's announcement, he had kept the project secret while he worked on the [[Red Circle Comics|Red Circle]] characters and ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]''.&lt;ref name=cbr24120/&gt;

Straczynski used his experiences as a journalist to add detail to the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' environment, for example, the character [[Jimmy Olsen]], called Jim in the books, is depicted as tougher and smarter than his mainstream counterpart. Straczynski wanted to retell the beginning of Clark Kent's transition to Superman, and explore possible alternatives to Clark becoming a superhero. Straczynski said; "he [Kent] could have been rich as an athlete, researcher, any number of things. There's a flashback scene to when Martha Kent finishes his uniform and gives it to him as a gift, hoping he'll go that way. He looks at it and says, in essence, 'Shouldn't there be a mask?' She says no, that 'when people see how powerful you are, all the things you can do, they're going to be terrified&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;unless they can see your face, and see there that you mean them no harm. The mask&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;is that what you're going to have to wear the rest of your life.{{'}}" Straczynski introduced a new villain character with a connection to [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], who was used to explain its destruction.&lt;ref name=cbr24120 /&gt;

Shane Davis removed the stereotypes associated with depictions of the civilian and superhero identities of Clark Kent. Davis drew the 20-year-old Clark wearing layers of clothing, showing that he is trying to blend in with his associates and differing from previous depictions of Kent wearing a suit, tie, and glasses, which Davis said, "didn't make sense".&lt;ref name=cbr23968&gt;{{cite web |first=Kiel |last=Phegley |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=23968  |title=Shane Davis Lands On "Earth One" |publisher = Comic Book Resources |date = 2009-12-08 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis also re-imagined Metropolis, which was historically depicted as an expanse of [[art deco]] buildings. Davis designed the city to look more realistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ashely |last=86 |url=http://www.dccollector.com/2010/05/10/shane-davis-talks-superman-earth-one/ |title=Shane Davis Talks Superman: Earth One |publisher=DC Collector |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2010-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523163636/http://www.dccollector.com/2010/05/10/shane-davis-talks-superman-earth-one/ |archivedate=May 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===Volume One===
Clark Kent arrives on a train in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], and rents a room at a hotel. The next morning he tries out several jobs: pro footballer, Major League baseball player, and positions in a scientific research company, and in financial services and media industries. Clark realizes he can do anything as each company wants to hire him. He calls [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|his mother]] and tells her what has happened, to which she replies that she would be happy with his choice of occupation. His last job stop is at the ''Daily Planet'' newspaper, where he meets [[Perry White]], [[Jimmy Olsen|James "Jim" Olsen]], and [[Lois Lane]].

However, upon hearing that the ''Daily Planet'' and the wider newspaper industry are in decline, Clark decides not to apply for the job, dumps his application, and flies into space. He thinks upon his history, and how his adoptive parents, Martha and Jonathan Kent, told him how they found him while hiking through woodland. The Kents saw a spaceship fly past them and crash, creating a [[sonic boom]] in its wake. They checked the wreckage for survivors, found a baby boy, and left with the infant and a small fragment of the wreckage. Some time later, the Kents decided to keep the child. Shortly after this, the US government and military arrive at the crash site. The Kents kept a small fragment of debris from the ship and learned of its, and the child's, extraterrestrial origins. Back in the narrative present, Clark talks to his late father's grave and says he feels incapable of being a superhero as he has already conformed to human society. Instead, he decides to begin a career and hopes that his father would accept that.

The next day, and twenty years after it crashed, Major Sandra Lee, a soldier working at a US Military base on advanced technology, revisits the crashed spaceship, which has regenerated its damaged and lost parts. The scientists working there have found symbols inside the atomic structure of the ship. Clark discovers his apartment is on fire, and quickly enters the building to recover the fragment of spacecraft and a red and blue outfit his mother made for him from the cloth he was wrapped in as an infant. Alone, Clark checks the fragment with his enhanced vision when he is hit with energy, becomes unconscious, and falls from the sky. The fragment talks and connects itself back to the ship in order to download more information. Just then, an invading alien force arrives and attacks Earth's major cities. The military quickly mobilizes, but the alien attack ships defeat Earth's fighter jets. Jim and Lois are almost killed because Jim wants to take photographs of the invasion. Clark, still unconscious, is given information he could not previously remember: the last moments of his homeworld, the planet Krypton.

Clark, born as Kal-El, is the son of [[Jor-El]] and [[Lara (comics)|Lara Lor-Van]], who waited until the last minute to dispatch him so that the shockwaves would hide his escape. The alien armada leader, Tyrell, reveals himself to the Earth but does not reveal his identity and purpose. He issues an ultimatum: the Earth will be destroyed, and millions will die if someone Tyrell has been looking for does not surrender to him. Major Lee and the scientists agree that the person for whom Tyrell is looking was in the crashed ship. Clark tries to attack the aliens without revealing himself, but Jim's photographs show a human-shaped red and blue blur. Clark goes for help at the research company that was about to employ him, but he finds that it is corrupt. Tyrell notices Jim taking pictures and almost kills him until Clark, who can no longer stand by and watch, destroys a robot. Tyrell is now aware of Clark's presence on Earth and prepares to increase the ferocity of his attack. Clark looks at his outfit, remembers wondering why there was no mask and his mother asking whether he wants to hide for the rest of his life, and his adoptive father coining the name "Superman". Clark decides to wear the outfit and reveals himself to the world as Superman.

Superman lands and starts destroying the alien robots and ships, and Tyrell reveals himself. He proves to be Superman's physical match, and says that Krypton's destruction was no accident but was an assassination. Tyrell originates from the planet Dheron. Krypton and Dheron were bitter enemies that fought several wars, which ended when a man whose identity is not-yet revealed provided a war machine, designed to destroy Krypton’s core. Although Krypton was destroyed, a scientist's son escaped, and a mission with whom Tyrell had been charged―to find and kill the child―was considered a failure. Tyrell proceeds to activate several war machines to destroy Earth, and hits Superman with a red solar energy beam that pins him down. Tyrell explains the nature of their powers and leaves to make final preparations. Because Superman is the cause of the invasion, no one in Metropolis wants to help. Lois and Jim get Superman out of the energy beam using a truck and Superman regains his strength and stands up. He and Tyrell fight again; this time Superman gains the upper hand by burning Tyrell with his heat vision. Superman's ship becomes fully regenerated, takes off to find him, and knocks Tyrell from behind. Tyrell tells Superman that his own spacecraft is almost as impervious as Kryptonian metal, from which Superman's ship is made. Superman enters Tyrell's weakened spacecraft and destroys it from the inside. Tyrell tries to stop him but is defeated, and he warns Superman that others like him will come to finish the job. Superman jumps off Tyrell's ship. The invasion is over, and Superman smiles and flies away. At a government base, Major Lee wonders who Superman is and what he wants, and whether his presence means more trouble for Earth. The general puts her in charge of researching Superman and his origin, and tells Lee to locate him.

After his ordeal, Clark walks home. The boss of the research company finds him and offers him a job, which Clark declines. A Dheronian battleship crash-lands in an indoor football field. Clark purchases some new clothing and formulates a "[[Clark Kent|Clark Kent disguise]]". He returns to the ''Daily Planet'', which is more enthusiastic and successful because its coverage of the invasion and Superman was superior to that of rival news media. Perry does not know what to call the new superhero until Clark suggests the name "Superman". Clark is hired because of an interview he claims he conducted with Superman, and he bonds with his new colleagues. Public opinion of Superman is mixed: some like him and see him as a hero; others do not trust him because he was the cause of the invasion. In the Arctic, Superman has hidden his ship in a secret cave, and its sentience activates and tells him his mission: to survive, use his powers well and wisely, and to avenge the murder of his homeworld. At the close of the story, Lois and Jim are on the ''Daily Planet'' rooftop discussing how Superman has changed the world. Jim photographs Superman again.

===Volume Two===
[[File:Superman-Earth One vol.2.jpg|thumb|right|Cover for ''Superman: Earth One, Volume 2'' by Shane Davis]]
The events depicted in ''Volume Two'' occur shortly after those of ''Volume One''. Perry promotes Clark to write articles to help rebuild the Daily Planet{{'}}s reputation. Lois is suspicious of Clark and the authenticity of his Superman article, so she decides to investigate his past. Clark later meets his neighbors Lisa Lasalle and Eddie Monroe; Lisa and Clark start dating.

Criminal [[Parasite (comics)|Raymond Maxwell Jensen]] infiltrates the [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] research facility to destroy evidence of his crimes kept by an accomplice. Jensen is discovered by guards and while escaping he is accidentally exposed to a high-energy neutrino that transforms him into an energy-absorbing supervillan called Parasite.  Elsewhere, Clark learns that a tsunami is about to hit the island of Borada. He travels there to help as Superman, but the island nation's ruthless dictator General Samsa sees him as a threat and threatens to kill his own people if Superman does not leave; Superman complies. Meanwhile, Parasite feeds on the life force of innocent people, killing them, but is unable to satiate his newfound hunger. Parasite decides that Superman might be powerful enough to feed him.

Distrustful of Superman, Major Lee proposes that the United States should develop countermeasures should he go rogue. Superman is lured to an incident at a power plant where Parasite attacks him and drains his energy, turning Parasite into a hulking beast with Superman's power. Weakened, Superman escapes while Parasite begins a rampage. Parasite's sister Theresa is informed of his actions, but refuses to believe that it is her brother and takes a flight to Metropolis to see for herself.

In the Arctic, the [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) aboard the Kryptonian ship that brought Superman to Earth has turned a cave system into a vast [[Fortress of Solitude]]. There, Superman researches a means to counter Parasite's power, and the AI offers to build a crystalline shielding warsuit. In the US, Lee responds to Parasite's rampage with military force; during the following attack, Lee realizes that Parasite is progressively weakening as the energy he absorbed fades. Parasite attacks the Daily Planet building to draw out Superman; they fight and Superman is completely drained and powerless, leaving him comparable to humans and capable of being injured. The next day, Superman's powers are restored and he returns to the Fortress. The AI completes the warsuit, but warns Superman that it will prevent him from using his heat vision, will block the sun's energy, which powers Superman, and that if Parasite breaches the suit and absorbs his power again, he will die.

Parasite again attacks the Daily Planet and Superman intervenes. With the warsuit, Superman can fight Parasite on equal terms, but the suit gradually disintegrates as the battle continues. Theresa arrives and Parasite breaks away from the fight to hug her, accidentally absorbing her energy and killing her. Parasite blames Superman for her death and resumes his attack. Superman strikes Parasite with his full strength, incapacitating him. Parasite is taken into the custody of the Secondary Army Advanced Technology Division.

During a later telephone conversation with his mother, Clark hears Lisa scream from her apartment and finds she is being attacked. As Superman, he flies her attacker to Alaska and warns him not to go near her again. Lisa tells Clark that she is working part-time as a prostitute to earn extra money. Clark is heartbroken but the pair agrees to remain friends.

In Borada, Superman instigates a rebellion against General Samsa, leading the country to democratic reform. Clark returns to his apartment and learns that Eddie has died of a heroin overdose. He writes an article about Eddie to raise awareness of the dangers of substance abuse. Clark receives a telephone call from a former teacher in Smallville, and learns that Lois is investigating his past. In the epilogue, Lee recruits the wealthy scientists [[Lex Luthor|Alexandra "Lex" Luthor]] and her husband Alexander, to help find a way to kill Superman.

===Volume Three===
[[File:Superman-Earth One vol.3.jpg|thumb|right|Cover for ''Superman: Earth One, Volume 3'' by Ardian Syaf]]
The events depicted in ''Volume Three'' occur a week after those of ''Volume Two''.  After General Samsa's removal on Borada, the [[United Nations]] grows increasingly concerned over Superman. Dr. Alexander Luthor and his wife, Alexandra, play the footage of Superman’s battle with Tyrell, revealing that Superman is vulnerable to red solar radiation.

In an unspecified desert, an extraterrestrial ship lands.  A mysterious humanoid figure appears, and begins to develop powers under Earth's yellow sun. He then tests his powers on a group of soldiers that appear before him, killing them all with ease.

Meanwhile, Clark and Lisa celebrate of the latter obtaining a job as a model.  Unbeknownst to them, Lisa accidentally drops one of her earrings on Clark's couch.  At ''The Daily Planet'', Clark and Jim discuss why Lois is investigating his past. Jim reveals to Clark that Lois is jealous of Clark's Superman story. Lois subsequently warns Superman that she learned from her uncle, a United Nations [[delegate]], that the U.N. is developing fail-safes against Superman.

Clark decides to confront Lois over what he found out from his family and friends. She reveals that she has ceased her investigation because she now sees Clark is a decent person of good character, and not the type of individual to fabricate a story.

Lisa has her proprietor, Mr. Abrahm, open Clark’s apartment door to find her earring.  After she retrieves it, she finds Clark’s costume in his closet, thus learning that he is Superman. She later tries to imply to Clark what she has learned, but he does not understand what she is trying to convey. When Superman later goes to the scene of a collapsing bridge, another super-powered being named [[General Zod|Zod-El]] appears, who says he is Superman’s biological uncle. Zod claims that he has been searching for Kal-El ever since Krypton exploded. Though Superman is glad that he is not the only survivor of Krypton, he is skeptical of whether Zod is an ally. Elsewhere, Lois discovers melted rods from the bridge and then video footage of an unidentified flying man prior of its collapse.

Zod addresses the United Nations, stating that the House of El caused the planet Krypton to explode, and that Superman is a threat. Zod persuades the delegates that he is an ally and wants to help them kill Superman. Lois receives a phone call from her uncle and learns that Zod is responsible for the bridge's collapse, after which she tries to warn Superman.

Zod reveals that he possesses a supply of [[kryptonite]] in his ship, from whose radiation his lead-lined skin-suit protects him. He intends to kill Superman, but Superman uses his knowledge of chemistry to cause Zod’s suit to disintegrate, forcing Zod to retreat.  Superman also discovers that Zod has convinced the world's governments that he is an enemy.

In the Fortress of Solitude, the AI reveals that prior to Krypton's destruction; it was in the middle of a global civil war between Zod and his brother, Superman's father, Jor-El, who had refused to join Zod. Ultimately, forces loyal to the planet’s Science Council defeated Zod, and in retaliation, Zod gave the Dheronians the weapon to destroy Krypton. Realizing that Zod intends to complete his revenge by hurting those he cares for, Superman arrives to his apartment building and fights Zod, but is no match for his uncle, who defeats him. Luthor and Lisa intervene to rescue him, but Luthor is killed and Lisa is critically injured. Luthor's red solar weapon greatly weakens Zod, allowing Alexandra to kill him.  Blaming Superman for her husband's death, Alexandra vows to kill Superman as she did Zod.  She subsequently places her husband's corpse in suspended animation and takes Zod's kryptonite from his ship.

In the hospital, Lisa recovers from her wounds and professes her love for Clark. Clark reciprocates her affection and they become a couple. Clark subsequently takes her to Smallville, where he introduces her to his adoptive mother. At the United Nations, Superman announces that although he is disappointed that they aligned themselves with Zod, it will not deter him from his mission to protect Earth. Seeing their fear, and noting Lois' her astute insights, Superman asks Lois to be his political conscience.

==List of characters==
*[[Clark Kent]]/Kal-El/[[Superman]]&lt;br /&gt; The 20-year-old adoptive son of a childless couple from [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], Kansas, Clark is aware that he did not originate on Earth and hopes one day to find his origin and purpose in life. He is especially gifted in science and journalism, despite only having earned an [[associate degree]] from Smallville Junior College. He travels to Metropolis in search of a career. Clark's extraterrestrial heritage gives him superhuman abilities while in the presence of Earth's yellow which include flight, immense strength, invulnerability to physical injury, the ability to see through solid objects, enhanced hearing, and the ability to burn objects with his eyesight. After the battle with Tyrell, Clark discovers his origin and his task as the last surviving Kryptonian; to use his powers well and wisely in order to survive, and to avenge the murder of Krypton. He decides that he should benefit and protect humanity as Superman. Clark finds he would rather work for the ''Daily Planet'', being impressed with the newspaper's integrity for the truth, and adopts the persona of a mild-mannered, spectacle-wearing reporter. 
*[[Jonathan and Martha Kent]]&lt;br /&gt; The couple are Clark's adoptive parents who, despite their awareness of Clark's extraterrestrial origins, rescued him as an infant from the wreckage of his spaceship.  Clark is especially close to his adoptive father, who provided him with wisdom and guidance that would shapes Clark's character. Clark was deeply affected when Jonathan died. Martha Kent is supportive towards her son, and has faith that Clark will choose the right path.  Prior to Jonathan's death, she made Clark's Superman costume using the indestructible Kryptonian clothing Clark was wrapped in when they found him.
*Tyrell &lt;br /&gt; Tyrell is the genocidal leader of an alien armada from the planet Dheron, a neighboring world of the destroyed planet Krypton. Tyrell invades Earth and has the information that Clark is desperately seeking, but Tyrell's aim is to kill Kal-El (Superman) or to destroy most of humanity if he does not reveal himself. Tyrell has some of the same powers as Superman under a yellow sun; superhuman strength, invulnerability, and flight. Tyrell dies when he is impaled by a sharp piece of falling equipment after his battle with Superman. Before he dies, Tyrell warns Clark that other Dheronians will also try to find and eliminate him, and refers to something that Clark still does not know about.
*[[Perry White]]&lt;br /&gt; The editor-in-chief of the ''[[Daily Planet]].''  White struggles to keep the once-great metropolitan newspaper running and refuse to give up, and only Lois Lane and Jim Olsen support him, as well as giving the inexperienced Clark Kent a chance to work for him. After the Dheronians' invasion and Superman's debut, the ''Daily Planet's'' in-depth coverage from Lois, Jim, and Clark of the event has saved the newspaper and return to its former glory, and Perry is proud that the ''Daily Planet'' is back on top.
*[[Lois Lane]]&lt;br /&gt; The staff reporter of the ''Daily Planet''.  Clark Kent develops a crush on Lois at first sight when he has a job interview with Perry White. Clark is impressed by her dedication and idealism towards her career during the Dheronians' invasion. Lois, along with Jim, also saves Clark when he, in his Superman persona, is trapped in Tyrell's gravity field. She later writes an editorial praising Superman's heroism during the crisis and eventually becomes his ally. She also currently has a yet-to-be-named boyfriend.
*[[Jimmy Olsen|James "Jim" Olsen]]&lt;br /&gt; The staff photographer of the ''Daily Planet''. Jim is known for his dedication to his job, deliberately putting himself in harm's way and risking life and limb for a perfect photograph. The photographs where Jim took during the invasion have saved the ''Daily Planet'' from financial failure and other news companies begin seeking reprint rights for Olsen's pictures.
*Major Sandra Lee&lt;br /&gt; A major in the US Army, scientist and a member of the Second Army Advanced Technology Division, a secret research facility where Clark's Kryptonian ship has been held and studied. Sandra has been tasked with finding out as much as possible about Superman and his origins. Sandra is skeptical of Superman's intentions and sees him as a potential threat to humanity, as the result she indirectly causes Alexander Luthor's death and puts his wife Alexandra into the path of villainy.
*The Artificial Intelligence (AI) aboard the Kryptonian ship that brought Superman to Earth, is introduced as a minor character in ''Volume One'', programmed by Superman's biological parents [[Jor-El]] and [[Lara (comics)|Lara Lor-Van]] to aid him.

===Volume Two===
A few new characters were introduced in Volume Two:
*[[Parasite (comics)#Superman: Earth One|Raymond Maxwell Jensen/Parasite]]:
:Raymond Maxwell Jensen is a common criminal who turns into an energy-absorbing supervillain in a scientific accident that leaves him with a constant hunger to consume to others' energy, killing them and enhancing his own strength and durability to match that of Superman, and also endowing him with energy projection abilities. In his backstory, Jensen was a troubled youth who bullied his classmates and mutilated animals.
*Lisa Lasalle:
:Clark's neighbor and love interest. Lisa is libidinous, teasing, playful and flirtatious, especially around Clark. As of ''Volume Three'' she has begun a career as a model and spends much of her time with Clark. She eventually discovers Clark's secret and supports his heroic endeavors.  
*Theresa Jensen:
:Parasite's sister, who believes that her brother is a consultant with a real estate firm and is unaware of his status as a murderous criminal until his transformation. He accidentally kills her when he embraces her, absorbing her vital energies.  
Minor characters include: General Samsa, dictator of the island of Borada; Eddie Monroe, Clark's neighbor and a heroin addict; Mr. Abrahm, Clark's landlord; and Jo Ann Massie, Clark's former teacher. Genius billionaire [[Lex Luthor|Alexandra "Lex" Luthor]] makes an appearance with her husband Alexander.

===Volume Three===
A few new characters were introduced in Volume Three:
*[[General Zod|General Zod-El]]: 
:He is Jor-El's brother and thus Superman's paternal uncle. Zod played a key role in Krypton's demise and seeks to destroy any remnant of its legacy, including his own nephew. Zod possesses the same abilities as Superman under Earth's yellow sun, although his military skill makes him an even deadlier opponent compared to his nephew. Zod kills Alexander Luthor after he arrives to rescue Superman, causing Alexandra to kill Zod in retaliation after he is weakened by Luthor's red solar weapon. Zod's actions inadvertently set Alexandra Luthor on a villainous path and vengeful against Superman.   
*Alexander and Alexandra Luthor:
:Hired by Major Sandra Lee to create fail-safe against Superman. The ''Earth One'' version of Lex Luthor, as clarified in ''Volume Three'', is actually Alexandra, while Alexander is a [[red herring]] and portrayed as sympathetic towards Superman, finding the prospect of killing him unethical. In contrast, Alexandra is ruthless, manipulative and enterprising, and finds the idea of killing Superman attractive, almost to the point of obsession. After her husband's death at the hands of General Zod-El, Alexandra was left heartbroken and vengeful, and holds Superman responsible. Vowing to kill the Man of Steel, she takes on the name "[[Lex Luthor]]".
*Lois Lane’s uncle, U.N. delegate Bill Lane, is a minor character appears in ''Volume Three''.

==Critical reception==

===Volume One===
''Superman: Earth One'' received mostly mixed to positive reviews. Before its release, various websites were given copies to review. [[Ain't It Cool News]] gave the book a positive review, and said, "Essentially JMS does what he does best; he delivers the “why” behind the what.." It also praised the attack on Earth for providing a reason for Clark to become Superman, and for being a magnified representation of the fear felt during the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name="Cool"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aintitcool.com/node/47119#1 |title = AICN COMICS REVIEWS: JMS' SUPERMAN EARTH ONE &amp; SUPERMAN "Grounded"!

Both reviewers concluded that the book was a competent retelling of the Superman origin story.&lt;ref name="iFanboy"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ifanboy.com/content/articles/REVIEW__Superman__Earth_One |title = REVIEW: Superman: Earth One |first1 = Josh |last1 = Flanagan |first2 = Paul |last2 = Montgomery |publisher = Graphicly|work = [[iFanboy]]|date = 2010-10-26 |accessdate = 2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Pepose of [[Newsarama]] also gave the book a positive review, and called Earth One's version of Superman an "unconscious reaction to [[Grant Morrison]]'s invulnerable, easy-going ''[[All-Star Superman]]''." Pepose also said the artwork was an iconic and cinematic, and that Clark's scene at his adoptive father's graveside and his conflict with his Kryptonian birthright were some of the best moments. He also praised the creative use of an entirely new villain.&lt;ref name="Newsarama/Pepose1"&gt; {{cite web |url = http://www.newsarama.com/comics/best-shots-advance-reviews-101026.html |title = Best Shots Advance Reviews: SUPERMAN: EARTH ONE, More|first = David |last =  Pepose |publisher = TechMediaNetwork |work =  Newsarama|date = 2010-10-26 |accessdate = 2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was ranked #1 on ''[[The New York Times]]''' Hardcover Graphic Books Best Seller List.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2010-11-14/hardcover-graphic-books/list.html "Hardcover Graphic Books"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. November 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviewers responded negatively to the book. Dan Phillips of [[IGN]] gave the book a 'poor' rating, and wrote that it was "riddled with creative decisions that'll leave you scratching your head in disbelief", that Superman "becomes an angst-ridden cliché with a flimsy moral center and an eye towards vengeance", and that the new villain "ranks as one of the most forgettable and shallow Superman rogues in memory." Phillips also said of Davis' artwork, "this story is told in a dull and often times ugly manner, and even the splash pages fail to truly catch your eye."&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://comics.ign.com/articles/112/1129376p1.html |title = Superman: Earth One HC Review: JMS' Superman re-imagining crash lands |first = Dan |last = Phillips |publisher = [[IGN]]|date = 2010-10-20 |accessdate = 2012-08-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Doug Zawisza of [[Comic Book Resources]] followed suit. While praising Clark’s search for a purpose, he objected to the idea that Clark would only become a hero due to the environment around him, and not as a personal choice. Zawisza also disliked Tyrell, the new villain, who he thought was possibly "one of the most underwhelming characters I have ever seen in comics. His appearance is a cross between [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] and [[David Bowie]], but without any of the positive qualities from either of them." He also saw the book as nothing more than a "pitch book" for the [[Man of Steel (film)|new movie]].&lt;ref name="cbr"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&amp;id=2805 | title = Review: Superman: Earth One |first = Doug |last = Zawisza | publisher  = Comic Book Resources | date = 2010-10-27 | accessdate =  2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redesign of Superman in ''Earth One'' was also reviewed in a number of major news publications, such as the ''[[New York Post]]'',&lt;ref name="NYPost"&gt;{{cite web |first = Dareh |last = Gregorian |date = 2010-10-25 |url = http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/it_new_look_for_superman_wWxd8MApuHBFBmh0b3a4eK |title =  New Superman for the 'Twilight" age |publisher  = NYP Holdings, Inc. |work =[[New York Post]]|accessdate = 2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'',&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite news|first = Darren |last = Franich |date = 2010-10-25 |url = http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/10/25/superman-earth-one/ |title = 'Superman: Earth One' turns Supes into an angsty, hoodie-wearing 21-year-old|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| accessdate = 2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yahoo!]].&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://omg.yahoo.com/blogs/crush/superman-gets-hipster-makeover-135404004.html |title = Superman Gets a Hipster Makeover&amp;nbsp;— Crush: Hollywood's Next Generation |publisher = [[Yahoo!

===Volume Two===
''Superman: Earth One Volume Two'' received mostly mixed to positive reviews. [[IGN]]'s Joey Esposito stated that while the sequel "still suffers from most of the same problems as it did the first time around, the positives are far more beneficial to the greater whole."&lt;ref name="IGN/Esposito"&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/31/superman-earth-one-volume-2-review|author = Joey Esposito |title =  Clark Kent outshines Superman in DC's latest take on the Man of Steel |publisher = IGN |date = October 31, 2012 |accessdate = February 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like its predecessor, it has also made into #1 on ''The New York Times''' Hardcover Graphic Books Best Seller List.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2012-11-25/hardcover-graphic-books/list.html "Hardcover Graphic Books"]. ''The New York Times''. November 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume Three===
''Superman: Earth One Volume Three'', like its predecessors, received mixed to positive reviews. Based on eight critic reviews, volume three received a 6.9 critics' rating out of 10 on the review aggregator Comic Book Round Up.&lt;ref name="RoundupReviews"&gt;{{cite web |url =http://comicbookroundup.com/comic-books/reviews/dc-comics/superman-earth-one/3 |title =  Superman: Earth One #3 Review Roundup |publisher = Comicbook Round Up.|accessdate = February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Santori-Griffith of Comicosity gave the book a very positive review, rewarding it with an overall score of 9.0 out of 10. In his review, Santori-Griffith said that the book was, by far, the best entry in the ''Superman: Earth One'' series yet.&lt;ref name="ComicosityVol3review"&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.comicosity.com/review-superman-earth-one-volume-3/ |author = Matt Santori-Griffith |title =  Review: SUPERMAN: EARTH ONE Volume 3 | publisher  = Comicosity |date = February 4, 2015 |accessdate = February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following suit, Steve Lam of Bam Smack Pow also gave the book a positive, writing that, "this is definitely a Superman for the 21st century," and of Ardian Syaf's artwork said that it was "dynamic and complement[ed] the writing of Straczynski well ... [giving the reader] something that is clear and compelling."&lt;ref name="BSPVol3review"&gt;{{cite web |url =http://bamsmackpow.com/2015/02/04/superman-earth-one-volume-3-review/ |author = Steve Lam |title = Superman: Earth One Volume 3 Review &amp;#8211; Continuing The Skillful Reimagining Of The Man Of Steel | publisher  = Comicosity |date = February 4, 2015 |accessdate = February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IGN gave the book a mixed review, bestowing upon it an overall score of 6.0 out of 10. The review gave good sentiments towards Ardian Syaf's artwork and wrote that he "shows a greater ability to use body language and facial expressions to enhance his storytelling," while also stating that Superman was given a "more well-rounded portrayal" in contrast to the previous two books. However, the review called the book's antagonist [[General Zod|Zod]] "the weakest villain of any Earth One book to date," and that "like the previous two volumes, Superman: Earth One [Volume Three] is a very flawed experience."&lt;ref name="IGN/EspositoVol3"&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/05/graphic-novel-review-superman-earth-one-vol-3 |author = Joey Esposito |title =  A World Against Superman |publisher = IGN |date = February 4, 2015 |accessdate = February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Comic Book Resources]]' Doug Zawisza gave the book a negative review; rewarding it with a two out of five stars overall rating. Of the story, Zawisza wrote that it was "clunky and appears to be driven by a series of boxes to be checked", and that "the leaps in storytelling cross from the script to the art and back again." In closing, Zawisza described the book as "painfully uneven", and that "[r]ather than forcing mediocre stories into a reliable schedule, this installment makes a strong case to look at the product and reconsider what it is that should make the 'Earth One' line exemplary."&lt;ref name="CBR/Zawisza"&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&amp;id=8246 |author = Doug Zawisza |title =  SUPERMAN: EARTH ONE, VOL. #3 | publisher  = Comic Book Resources |date = February 4, 2015 |accessdate = February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Superman: Earth One Volume Three'' also made into #1 on ''The New York Times''' Hardcover Graphic Books Best Seller List.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2015-03-01/hardcover-graphic-books/list.html "Hardcover Graphic Books"].

[[Argentina|Argentine]] television broadcasting began in 1951 with the inaugural of then state-owned [[Televisión Pública Argentina|Canal 7]], developed by ''[[Radio Belgrano]]'' executive [[Jaime Yankelevich]]. Color television broadcasting, however, was not widely available until after 1978, when the government launched Argentina Televisora Color (ATC), now [[Televisión Pública Argentina]] (Argentina's principal public television station). Argentina is one of only five Latin American countries to use the [[PAL]] [[broadcast television system]] and is also one of the only four Spanish-speaking countries to use PAL (the others being [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Spain]]). The prevalence of cable television, increasing steadily since the first CATV transmitter opened in the city of [[Junin, Buenos Aires|Junín]] in 1965, is now the third-widest in the world, reaching at least 78% of households.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liceus.com/cgi-bin/ac/pu/Formatos%20repudiados,%20formatos%20exitosos%20II.pdf Liceus: Formatos repudiados y exitosos de la televisión]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digital television ==
[[Image:Terraza-canal-7-e.JPG|thumb|left|260px|Satellite transmitters at Channel 7, Buenos Aires.]]

Argentina has adopted the Japanese standard [[ISDB-T]], with modifications performed by Brazil. Initially Argentina had selected [[ATSC standard]] in 1998 (Res. 2387/98) which was backed by Grupo Clarin over [[DVB-T]] promoted by the biggest incumbent telcos and European cellphone manufacturers like Nokia. There had been experimental ATSC broadcasts since 1999 before the government overruled the decision.

There is an agreement between [[Brazil]] and Argentina, signed in the light of the Mercosur trade bloc, where both countries agree to share information, studies and efforts to select the same Digital TV standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnti.gob.ve/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;catid=45:internacionales&amp;id=694:-tv-digital-argentina-se-acerca-al-estandar-elegido-por-brasil&amp;Itemid=72]&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 27, 2009, the Argentine government officially announced that the Japanese standard was adopted, along with Chile and Perú at the same time. The goal behind this political decision is to achieve a wide, free, high quality regional TV.
 
Major TV broadcasters, namely [[Canal 13 (Argentina)|El Trece]] and [[Telefe]] had been showing off sample digital broadcasts at electronics and media sector shows like the CAPER exhibition, but Canal 13 still hasn't started to broadcast in the now official Argentine standard.

[[HDTV]]-ready TV sales are increasing in Argentina, with the first TVs made available since 2005 by local firm [[Philips]]. The firm introduced back then three HD-ready (1080i) CRT TVs in 25, 29, and 33-inch versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2006/12/31/big-fat-philips-hdtv-ready-crt-lack-hdmi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718194118/http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2006/12/31/big-fat-philips-hdtv-ready-crt-lack-hdmi |archivedate=2008-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These tvs were manufactured in [[Tierra del Fuego]], Argentina and included Pal-N/B and NTSC analogue tuners, plus HD component video inputs. Only a single model, the 25-inch, 16:9 one featured [[HDMI]]. As of 2008 the firm has switched to LCDs.

In November 2008, local cable TV firm Cablevision, which merged with Multicanal, started offering its "Cablevision HD" service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://microsite.cablevision.com.ar/cvdigital/hd/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106042939/http://microsite.cablevision.com.ar/cvdigital/hd/ |archivedate=2008-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This rather expensive offering costs an additional $30 [[Argentine peso|ARS]] over the standard Digital-TV service price. It uses ATSC and the firm makes mandatory the purchase of its "HD Tuner with DVR" at a cost of around $200 US dollars. As of late 2008 most LCDs advertised as "Full HD" offer at least 1080i signal support.

As of December 2013, digital television has reached 80 percent of Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Argentina has 80% coverage of digital television|url=http://www.tvyvideo.com/en/201401145348/noticias/tecnologia/argentina-tiene-un-80-de-cobertura-en-television-digital.html|accessdate=25 January 2014|newspaper=TV y Video|date=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina will end all analogue broadcasts in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Argentina confirms analogue TV switch-off for 2019|url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/argentina-confirms-analogue-tv-switch-off-for-2019--882063|accessdate=25 January 2014|newspaper=Telecom Paper|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cable ==
Cable television had its origins in the 1960s, when a CATV service started to operate in [[Junín, Buenos Aires]]. Currently, cable television is available in 5.5 million homes, the best ratio in Latin America and second in the world.

In the 1980s cable operators started operations in the absence of local regulations. Those earlier operators started a merged process which evolved toward the merge of Cablevision and Multicanal, the two biggest cable companies. The resultant company, named Cablevision, is owned by Grupo Clarin, the biggest newspaper in Argentina, who is also the owner of LS85-TV (the 2nd highest-rated TV station in Buenos Aires) TyC the owner of the monopoly of the soccer TV broadcast rights, thus turning into the dominant player.

Some small TV cable companies are operating, but the tendency now is that Cablevision will dominate this market in the future. Telecom Operator, Telefónica and Telecom, the monopoly in the fixed-cellular market is lobbying for opening the market towards the triple play. The Government is opening a window to allow the cable operators to enter in the telephony and extend internet coverage, before fully deregulating this market. In order to operate as a cable company in Argentina, a license from Comfer is required. This license is very difficult to get.

Following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the [[Iraq]]i state media collapsed. In June 2004, a [[Communications and Media Commission (Iraq)|Communications and Media Commission]] was set up to approve and grant licenses for all the country's media.&lt;ref name=amo12/&gt; By 2011, Iraq was main headquarters to 49 free-to-air satellite channels, one of the highest number in the region.&lt;ref name=amo12/&gt;

Until 2003, satellite dishes were banned, and there were a limited number of national terrestrial stations in the country.&lt;ref name=amo12/&gt; After 2003, the sale of satellite dishes surged, and free-to-air channels entered the market.&lt;ref name=amo12/&gt;

There are 16 terrestrial channels, of which three are owned by the US-funded state broadcaster [[Iraqi Media Network]].&lt;ref name=amo12/&gt; In March 2011, [[Al Jazeera]] was granted rights to re-establish operations in the country, after being banned in 2004.&lt;ref name=amo12/&gt; There are plans to set up a media free zone based in Baghdad, the [[Baghdad Media City]], which is targeted for completion towards the end of 2014.&lt;ref name=amo12&gt;{{cite web|title=Arab Media Outlook 2011-2015|url=http://www.arabmediaforum.ae/userfiles/EnglishAMO.pdf|pages=179–180|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===1956-2003===
The first TV station in Baghdad began broadcasts on 2 May 1956. In 1967 the second Iraqi TV station was founded in Kirkuk, and in 1968 new stations began in Mosul and Basrah. In 1975 color programming was introduced using the French SECAM system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4282908 |title=Radio and Television in Iraq: The Electronic Media in a Transitionary Arab World Country |author=Douglas A. Boyd |date=October 1982 |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Iraqi TV'' was the primary TV station&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slate.msn.com/id/2080681 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225063701/http://slate.msn.com/id/2080681/ |archivedate=2009-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Iraq]] while [[Saddam Hussein]] was in power. Until the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], much of its programming was patriotic music videos, government news and propaganda. It ceased broadcasting during the 2003 invasion when the transmitter network became inoperable due to bombing raids.

Because ''Iraqi TV'' was free to air, it also received a substantial amount of attention from viewers outside Iraq, especially during the 2003 invasion of the country.

A second TV channel called ''Youth Channel'' (Qanaat Al-Shabaab) was opened in 1994 and broadcast many subtitled Western movies and music videos before the 2003 invasion. Foreign programmes were censored to remove strong language, sex, and violence so programming would be suitable for all ages.

===2003-present===
Many TV stations have appeared since the fall of Saddam. Under the direction of Ambassador L. [[Paul Bremer III]] as the Administrator, the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] (CPA) began issuing radio and television licenses in June 2003 to meet the great demand for broadcasting licenses.  The licenses were issued by the CPA Senior Adviser for Telecommunications. To plan for the expected great demand, this CPA office worked with Iraqi radio-frequency spectrum engineers and managers to develop a national FM-radio and TV channel allotment plan for all of the major Iraqi cities and towns. The national plan was developed using technical criteria and the Region 1 (Europe, Africa and the Middle East) allotment plan that was developed years before by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a United Nations treaty organization. The Iraqi allotment plan consisted of hundreds of FM radio and TV stations allotted to the cities and towns. The channels in the allotment plan were then open to anyone to apply for a license for a particular channel.

The CPA developed a few basic rules and regulations in June and July 2003 to provide a limited regulatory control of the broadcasters.  For example, broadcasts inciting riots were prohibited. The overall CPA objective was to issue many licenses to provide for a plethora of diverse voices, information, music, and news to satisfy the desires and tastes of the Iraqi citizens. The CPA also recognized that broadcasting was a combination of business, advertising, journalism, engineering, and entertainment, and a robust and thriving broadcasting industry could provide a large number of excellent and highly desirable professional jobs that would reduce national unemployment. The CPA also recognized that commercial broadcasting could provide wealth-building opportunities to successful broadcasters.

The Iraqi Media Network (IMN), a public broadcasting network similar to the Public Broadcasting System in the United States, was issued radio and TV licenses by the CPA.

The CPA continued its work as the national broadcasting licensing and regulatory authority until June 2004 when the Iraq Communications and Media Commission (CMC) was established as the national regulatory agency that would issue licenses and regulate broadcasting and telecommunications.

In August 2014, [[LANA TV]] a new general entertainment channel started broadcasting regional series dubbed in Iraqi dialect. This is the first time that a TV Channel is broadcasting high quality Iraqi dubbing. [[LANA TV]] has hired Iraq's top theatre actors and actress such as Ustad Sami Qeftan to train the dubbing artists.

The overall result is that there are hundreds of radio and television stations operating in Iraq.

'''The Barrier''' (transliterated: ''Al Hajiz'') is a 1990 [[Bahrain]]i [[Arabic language]] [[drama film]] directed and produced by [[Bassam Al-Thawadi]], starring Ebrahim Bahar, Rashed Al-Hassan and Mariam Ziman. The screenplay was written by Ameen Salih. The film is widely regarded as being the first [[feature film]] produced in Bahrain.&lt;ref name=GW&gt;{{cite news|title=A Bahraini's passion for films|url=http://www.gulfweekly.com/Articles.aspx?articleid=16419|accessdate=21 June 2012|newspaper=Gulf Weekly|date=August 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The movie deals with social and emotional barriers imposed upon individuals by [[society]] and also with those that the individual imposes upon himself. The characters in the movie lack the ability to communicate with each other and therefore, fail to understand their own emotions. Hence, they fail to maintain healthy [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s with each other because of the lack of love amongst them. This failure is attributed to the surrounding environment that does not allow for healthy relationships to grow and prosper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMDB profile|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390072/|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again''''', also known as '''''DK2''''', is a 2001-2002 [[DC Comics]] three-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] comic book written and illustrated by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and colored by [[Lynn Varley]]. The series is a sequel to Miller's 1986 miniseries ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]''.

The series features an [[ensemble cast]] of superheroes including [[Carrie Kelley|Catgirl]], [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Plastic Man]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]], and [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|the Atom]].

== Overview ==
The series was originally published as a three-issue limited series published by DC Comics between November 2001 and July 2002. It has since been published as hardcover and paperback one-volume editions and as the [[DC Comics Absolute Edition|''Absolute Dark Knight'']] edition with ''The Dark Knight Returns''.

[[Image:DarkKnightStrikesAgain1.jpg|right|thumb|Frank Miller's cover to ''The Dark Knight Strikes Again'' #1.]]
After going underground, Batman (Bruce Wayne) and his young sidekick Catgirl (formerly [[Carrie Kelley]]{{mdash}}[[Robin (comics)|Robin]]) train an army of "Batboys" (the former Mutants and other recruits) to save the world from a police dictatorship led by [[Lex Luthor]]. In a series of raids on government facilities, Batman's soldiers release other superheroes{{mdash}}including [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] and [[Plastic Man]]{{mdash}}from captivity. [[Elongated Man]] is recruited and [[Green Arrow]] is already working with Batman.

[[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]], and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] have been forced to work for the US government, as their loved ones are being held hostage. Superman is ordered by "[[Prez (comics)|President Rickard]]" (a computer-generated front for Lex Luthor and [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]) to stop Batman. He confronts Wayne at the [[Batcave]], but Batman and the other superheroes defeat him. Meanwhile, Batman's raids have been noticed by the media. After being banned for years, the freed superheroes have recaptured the public imagination and have become a fad among the youth. At a pop concert by "The Superchix", Batman and the other heroes make a public appearance urging their fans to rebel against the oppressive government.

During this time, rogue vigilante [[Question (comics)|Question]] spies on Luthor's plans and types a journal to record the misdeeds of those in power. Question tries to convince the [[Martian Manhunter]]{{mdash}}now an aged, bitter, near-powerless figure with his mind filled with Luthor's nanotechnology{{mdash}}to stand up against Superman and the government. Question and Martian Manhunter are attacked by a mysterious man resembling [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]], who is seemingly invulnerable to injury. Martian Manhunter sacrifices his life and Question is rescued by Green Arrow. The mysterious man escapes to kill other superheroes including [[Guardian (DC Comics)|Guardian]] and [[Creeper (comics)|Creeper]], stealing their costumes and wearing them.

An extraterrestrial monster lands in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and begins to destroy the city. Batman is convinced that it is an attempt to lure him and his allies out of hiding and does not respond, dismissing Flash's appeal that they are supposed to save lives. Batman's opinion is that it is too risky to save the lives of the populace. Superman and Captain Marvel fight the monster which is Brainiac, who coerces Superman into defeat using the bottled Kryptonian city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] as leverage, to crush the people's faith in superheroes. Captain Marvel is killed defending citizens from the carnage but Superman is saved when his daughter Lara appears. She has been carefully hidden since birth but now that the government knows she exists, they demand that she be handed over.

Deciding that Batman and his methods are the only way, Superman, Wonder Woman and Lara join him. Lara pretends to hand herself over to Brainiac. Atom slips into the bottle and frees the Kandorians, who use their combined heat vision to destroy Brainiac. The superheroes then destroy the dictatorship's power source and incite a revolution. Batman allows himself to be captured and tortured by Luthor to learn his plans. Luthor has launched satellites to destroy most of the world's population,  leaving him with a more manageable number of people. The Green Lantern, who has turned into pure will, returns from space and destroys Luthor's satellites. Luthor is in turn killed by the son of [[Hawkman]].

Returning to the Batcave, Batman is contacted by Carrie, who is being attacked by the Joker-like man and now wearing a Robin costume. Batman arrives and recognizes the man as [[Dick Grayson]], the first Robin who Batman fired long ago. Grayson has been genetically altered to have a powerful healing factor and shape-shifting ability, but is criminally insane. As Batman and Grayson contemptuously recall their bleak history together, Batman drops him through a trapdoor into a miles-deep crevasse filled with lava, while Elongated Man rescues Carrie. Grayson clings onto a ledge, climbs out of the chasm and faces Batman. When Grayson remains virtually unharmed by everything Batman throws at him, Batman hurls himself and Grayson into the chasm. Grayson falls into the lava and is disintegrated. Superman rescues Batman at the last minute as the Batcave explodes, and takes him to Carrie in the Batmobile.

==Characters==
* '''[[Batman (Dark Knight Universe)|Batman]]'''{{mdash}}Bruce Wayne's alter ego who is 58 years old and faked his death three years ago and continues to operate secretly as Batman. He leads a rebellion against the corrupt U.S. government headed by Lex Luthor. Batman is a skilled and controversial strategist who makes decisions which result in deaths, which he considers necessary for the defeat of his enemies.
* '''[[Carrie Kelley|Catgirl]]'''{{mdash}}Carrie Kelley, formerly Robin, is Batman's second-in-command.
* '''[[Lex Luthor]]'''{{mdash}}the main antagonist of ''The Dark Knight Strikes Again''. Luthor heads the U.S. government and uses a hologram of what the people think is the President as a figurehead. He controls powerful superheroes{{mdash}}including Superman, Captain Marvel and Wonder Woman{{mdash}}by holding their loved ones hostage.

==Plot==
The story is set in the [[Qing dynasty]] during the reign of the [[Qianlong Emperor]] ({{reign}} 1735–1796). The protagonist, Hu Fei, is a young martial artist who was raised by Ping A'si after the death of his father, Hu Yidao. While travelling around the land in search of adventure, Hu Fei encounters Feng Tiannan, a ruthless villain, and wants to kill him to deliver justice for the victims. He also meets a young maiden, Yuan Ziyi, who shows signs of affection towards him. She stops Hu Fei from killing Feng Tiannan each time when he is close to killing Feng.

Based on what Ping A'si told him, Hu Fei believes that Miao Renfeng is responsible for his father's death. He refrains from killing Miao after finding him, because Miao has been tricked by an enemy and temporarily blinded by a deadly poison. He is so impressed with Miao's sense of chivalry that he starts wondering if Ping A'si was mistaken about Miao. He decides to help Miao and journeys to find a cure for his eyes. He meets Cheng Lingsu, an apprentice of a deceased medicine guru known as the "King of Venoms". Hu Fei witnesses Cheng Lingsu defeating her three wicked seniors with her calm and wit. She agrees to help him cure Miao Renfeng's eyes.

When Miao Renfeng regains his sight, he confesses that he did kill Hu Yidao unintentionally several years ago. Hu Fei is filled with sorrow upon hearing the truth and he leaves with Cheng Lingsu. Cheng Lingsu and Hu Fei become sworn siblings. While travelling together, they chance upon an election for a new leader of the ''[[Jianghu|wulin]]'' (martial artists' community) hosted by the general [[Fuk'anggan]]. The election is part of Fuk'anggan's plan to instigate turmoil in the ''wulin'' and keep it under the Qing government's control. Hu Fei and Cheng Lingsu disguise themselves and participate in the event. With help from Yuan Ziyi, the trio combine efforts to expose Fuk'anggan's plot and disrupt the election.

They are attacked by enemies and Hu Fei is poisoned while shielding Cheng Lingsu with his body. Cheng loses her life trying to save Hu and reveals to him before dying that she loves him. Hu is filled with anguish after hearing that. After Cheng's funeral, he meets Yuan Ziyi, who tells him that she had already taken an oath to be a Buddhist nun in her childhood, and hence cannot be together with him even though she loves him. She places her palms together and recites a silent prayer for him before leaving.

==Plot==
Samuel Tong ([[Francis Ng]]) resided in the UK to spend a long vacation following his wife's death. After encountering Holiday Ho ([[Fala Chen]]), a wanderer whose boyfriend died in an aviation accident, he ends his vacation early after finally making the cake that he made for his deceased wife, Zoe, he returns to Hong Kong, and joins [[Solar Airways and Skylette Airlines|Skylette Airlines]] as a pilot to fly again. He meets Captain Jayden "Captain Cool" Koo ([[Julian Cheung]]), and the two exhibit two distinct personalities, with Sam being reserved and Jayden being a man who likes to attract attention.

Respectively, the two get emotionally entangled with Holiday, who arrives in Hong Kong to apply for pilot training (PPP&amp;nbsp;— Pre-pilot Project). Moreover, Sam becomes a training captain to assess Jayden, leading to a competition between the two for both career and love.

Jayden's younger sister Summer Koo ([[Myolie Wu]]) is an aircraft maintenance technician, and she bears grudges against her brother due to an unhappy experience during her childhood. Samuel's younger brother Issac ([[Ron Ng]]), due to Summer physically resembling his sister-in-law Zoe, is unable to turn a blind eye on it and helps settle the dispute between Summer and her brother. Summer has a crush on Issac, yet Issac restrains himself from taking another step forward in order to avoid evoking Sam's grief.

In the end, the misunderstanding causes Summer to think that she was only treated like Zoe (Sam's deceased wife) in Issac's eyes. First Officer Roy Ko ([[Kenneth Ma]]) has two girlfriends and cannot make up his mind as he does not bear to hurt anyone.  After sharing his secret with Heather Fong ([[Elena Kong]]), a [[Purser#Aircraft|senior purser]], Roy and she become close associates, and the two even have a one-night stand.

Jim Jim ([[Him Law]]), who used to represent Hong Kong in swimming, plans to retire and enrol in flight training, where he falls in love with CoCo Ling ([[Nancy Wu]]), who is to be a [[Surrogacy|surrogate]] mother for her friend.

With the planes taking-off and landing, stories of sorrow, parting, joyfulness and re-encounters have been constituted.

===Development===
In May 2011 Tommy Leung, deputy chief director of [[TVB]]'s drama department, announced their plans to develop a sequel to ''[[Triumph in the Skies]]'' with intentions to begin filming in September of that year.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;{{cite news | work=IHKTV | title=TVB to film Triumph in the Skies sequel with original cast, Raymond Lam rumoured to join | date=2011-05-11 | url=http://www.ihktv.com/tvb-new-drama-triumph-in-the-skies-2.html | accessdate=2011-12-29 | language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leung added that a theatrical film sequel would be made in the beginning of 2012, in hopes of boosting TVB artistes to become film stars.&lt;ref name="first" /&gt;

In June 2011, it was reported at a TVB press conference that [[Michael Miu]], [[Raymond Lam]], [[Fala Chen]], and [[Kate Tsui]] were in negotiations to join, with original cast members [[Ron Ng]], [[Myolie Wu]], [[Bosco Wong]], [[Kenneth Ma]], and [[Nancy Wu]] slated to return.&lt;ref name="tvbpower"&gt;{{cite news | work=IHKTV | title=TVB Power Press Conference | date=2011-06-07 | url=http://www.ihktv.com/tvb-power-sky100-press.html | accessdate=2011-12-29 | language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Hsuan]], at the time, submitted her name to be part of this series to work with Francis Ng and Chilam Cheung; but it did not work out as her contract with TVB had ended.

In July 2011, Ron Ng, Myolie Wu, Kenneth Ma, Nancy Wu, Fala Chen, and Kate Tsui were confirmed to film the sequel. Following the announcement, TVB pushed back the filming schedule from September 2011 to December 2011 due to negotiation problems with ''Triumph II'''s previous airline sponsor [[Cathay Pacific]], which caused some of the newly signed cast members to withdraw, including Michael Miu.&lt;ref name="postpone"&gt;{{cite news | work=IHKTV | title=Triumph II suddenly postpones production | date=2011-07-02 | url=http://www.ihktv.com/mingpaoweekly-2225-triumphintheskies.html | accessdate=2011-12-29 | language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To accommodate the schedules of Ron Ng and Kenneth Ma, whom were booked to film television drama ''[[Silver Spoon, Sterling Shackles]]'' from November 2011 to March 2012, TVB postponed ''Triumph II'''s filming to May 2012.&lt;ref name="postpone2"&gt;{{cite news | work=IHKTV | title=40-episode long drama 'The Prominent Family' | date=2011-08-27 | url=http://www.ihktv.com/mingpaoweekly-2233-ladies.html | accessdate=2011-12-29 | language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, it was reported that [[Hong Kong Airlines]] replaced Cathay Pacific as the drama's main sponsorship.&lt;ref name="cathay"&gt;{{cite news | work=IHKTV | title=Cathay Pacific not sponsoring Triumph II | url=http://www.ihktv.com/next-1125-triumphintheskies-ii.html | accessdate=2011-12-29 | language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, TVB aired a sales promotional trailer for ''Triumph II'' to attract more sponsors, which included a surprise appearance by original cast member [[Francis Ng]] at the end of the trailer. [[Julian Cheung]], who replaced Michael Miu's role in the trailer, was reportedly hired by TVB for 80,000 HKD per episode,&lt;ref name="sales"&gt;{{cite news | work=IHKTV | title=Julian Cheung to film Triumph II | url=http://www.ihktv.com/chilam-triumph-in-the-skies-2.html | date=2011-10-08 | accessdate=2011-12-29 | language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="script"&gt;{{cite news | work=IHKTV | title=Julian Cheung willing to be TVB's godson | url=http://www.ihktv.com/chilam-orbis-ambassador-child.html | date=2011-10-13 | accessdate=2011-12-29 | language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later confirmed his involvement in April 2012.&lt;ref name="chilamadd"&gt;{{cite news | work=TVB Entertainment News via IHKTV | title=2012-04-03 Video Clip | url=http://www.weibo.com/1686300145/ycVCm1Opb | date=2012-04-03 | accessdate=2012-04-03 | language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond Lam and Bosco Wong also appeared in the footage, but both backed out due to conflicting schedules.&lt;ref name="raybos"&gt;{{cite news | work=Jayne Stars | title=Raymond Lam and Bosco Wong will not act in Triumph in the Skies 2 | url=http://www.jaynestars.com/news/raymond-lam-and-bosco-wong-will-not-act-in-triumph-in-the-skies-2/ | date=2012-03-10 | accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rebecca Zhu]] was later confirmed to join the cast.&lt;ref name="chilamdrop"&gt;{{cite news | work=IHKTV | title=Chilam rejected offer to avoid Francs Ng | url=http://www.ihktv.com/face-240-triumphintheskies-2.html | date=2011-12-28 | accessdate=2011-12-29 | language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 2011, it was reported that Francis Ng was in negotiations to return.&lt;ref name="ngreturn"&gt;{{cite news | work=IHKTV | title=Francis Ng will return to film Triumph II | url=http://www.ihktv.com/francis-ng-back-to-the-nest-film-triumph-in-the-skies-2-laughing-brother-was-killed-by-explosion.html | date=2011-12-21 | accessdate=2011-12-29 | language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; To accommodate Ng's schedule, filming was postponed again to September 2012,&lt;ref name="postponesept"&gt;{{cite news | work=IHKTV | title=Triumph in the Skies II filming postponed to September | url=http://www.ihktv.com/triumph-in-the-skies-2-extended-shooting-francis-ng-playing-xie-tvb.html | date=2012-04-05 | accessdate=2012-04-05 | language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then moved forward to July 2012.

In May 2012, Kate Tsui revealed in an interview done in Australia that she had been pulled out of the cast to film a mainland Chinese drama instead.&lt;ref name="tsuidrop"&gt;{{cite news | work=IHKTV | url=http://www.weibo.com/1686300145/ynEg67WLa | title=IHKTV's Official Weibo | date=2012-06-13 | accessdate=2012-06-13 | language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her announcement, [[Elena Kong]] and Kelly Fu were cast. On 23 May 2012, ''Next Magazine'' reported that [[Sammul Chan]] was in negotiations to return for a HK$25,000 per episode deal.&lt;ref name="nextmag"&gt;{{cite news | work=Next Magazine via IHKTV | title=Shell King invites Sammul Chan to return for Triumph in the Skies II | url=http://www.ihktv.com/next-1159-sammulchan.html | accessdate=2012-05-24 | date=2012-05-23 | language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chan expressed an interest, but ultimately had to reject the offer due to a schedule clash.

A press conference was held on 18 July 2012.&lt;ref name="presscon"&gt;{{cite news | work=IHKTV | title=Triumph in the Skies II press conference | url=http://www.ihktv.com/triumph-in-the-skies-ii-reporter.html | date=2012-07-18 | accessdate=2012-07-18 | language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;
