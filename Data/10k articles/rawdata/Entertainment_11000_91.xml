An '''antihero''' or '''antiheroine''' is a [[protagonist]] in a story who lacks conventional [[Hero|heroic qualities]] and attributes such as [[Ideal (ethics)|idealism]], courage and morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Antihero |title=antihero |publisher=American Heritage Dictionary |date=9 January 2013 |accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/anti-hero |title=anti-hero |publisher=Macmillan Dictionary |date= |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antiheroine?show=0&amp;t=1350251069 |title=Antiheroine |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anti-hero |title=anti-hero |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |date= |accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="merriam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antihero |title=Antihero |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although antiheroes may sometimes perform actions that are morally correct, it is not always for the right reasons, often acting primarily out of self-interest or in ways that defy conventional [[ethical code]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laham|first1=Nicholas|title=Currents of Comedy on the American Screen: How Film and Television Deliver Different Laughs for Changing Times |date=2009|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=9780786442645|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Kerouac_by_Palumbo.jpg|thumb|right|225px|U.S. writer [[Jack Kerouac]] and other figures of the "[[Beat Generation]]" created reflective, critical protagonists who influenced the antiheroes of many later works.]]

An early antihero is [[Homer]]'s [[Thersites]].&lt;ref name="tolstoy1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steiner|first1=George|title=Tolstoy Or Dostoevsky: An Essay in the Old Criticism|date=2013|publisher=Open Road|location=New York|isbn=9781480411913}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|197–198}} The concept has also been identified in classical [[Greek drama]],&lt;ref name="britannica1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27600/antihero |title=antihero |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=14 February 2013 |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman satire, and Renaissance literature&lt;ref name="tolstoy1"/&gt;{{rp|197–198}} such as ''[[Don Quixote]]''&lt;ref name="britannica1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wheeler|first1=L.

The term antihero was first used as early as 1714,&lt;ref name="merriam"/&gt; emerging in works such as ''[[Rameau's Nephew]]'' in the 18th century,&lt;ref name="tolstoy1"/&gt;{{rp|199–200}} and is also used more broadly to cover [[Byronic hero]]es as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wheeler|first1=L.

Literary [[Romanticism]] in the 19th century helped popularize new forms of the antihero,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alsen|first1=Eberhard|title=The New Romanticism: A Collection of Critical Essays|date=2014|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=Hoboken|isbn=9781317776000|page=72|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DDHKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=anti+hero+romanticism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YUc1VYjuMs7jaJjbgbAO&amp;ved=0CC4QuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=anti%20hero%20romanticism&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simmons|first1=David|title=The Anti-Hero in the American Novel: From Joseph Heller to Kurt Vonnegut|date=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=9780230612525|page=5|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KZnFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=anti+hero+romanticism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YUc1VYjuMs7jaJjbgbAO&amp;ved=0CCQQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=anti%20hero%20romanticism&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Gothic double]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lutz|first1=Deborah|title=The Dangerous Lover: Gothic Villains, Byronism, and the Nineteenth-century Seduction Narrative|date=2006|publisher=Ohio State University Press|location=Columbus|isbn=9780814210345|page=82|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=47I-p5s49vQC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=antihero+%22gothic+double%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bUU1VY7ZMYPsasrUgegJ&amp;ved=0CDIQuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=antihero%20%22gothic%20double%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The antihero eventually became an established form of social criticism, a phenomenon often associated with the unnamed protagonist in [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Notes from Underground]].''&lt;ref name="tolstoy1"/&gt;{{rp|201–207}} The antihero emerged as a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to the traditional hero archetype, a process that [[Northrop Frye]] called the fictional "center of gravity".&lt;ref name="Frye"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frye|first1=Northrop|title=Anatomy of Criticism|date=2002|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=9780141187099|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement indicated a literary change in heroic ethos from feudal aristocrat to urban democrat, as was the shift from epic to ironic narratives.&lt;ref name="Frye"/&gt;

[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Huckleberry Finn]] (1884) has been called "the first antihero in the American nursery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hearn|first1=Michael Patrick|first3=|title=The Annotated Huckleberry Finn: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer's Comrade)|date=2001|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=0393020398|page=xvci|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barthélemy Hus''', called '''Hus-Desforges''' (18 July 1699 in [[Bordeaux]] – 1 September 1786 in [[Lyon]], aged 63) was an 18th-century French comedian and troupe leader.

The son of {{Interlanguage link multi|maître à danser|fr}} Jérôme Hus and Marguerite Pageot, called Desforges, he was the youngest member of the [[Hus family]] and with his brother [[François Hus|François]], directed a touring company known as the "[[Hus brothers]] troupe."

Around 1722, he married Marie Anne Daguerre Ascorette, actress born in [[Namur]] (1709-1736). The couple had at least seven children who would be part of the troupe.

On 27 January 1750, he married in Brussels his second wife, Louise Vivier de Courtenay, descendant of the famous [[Capetian House of Courtenay|Courtenay family]].

Barthélemy Hus-Desforges was the grandfather of musician [[Pierre-Louis Hus-Desforges]] (1773-1838).

'''Bayesian efficiency''' is an analog of [[Pareto efficiency]] for situations in which there is [[incomplete information]].&lt;ref name="implementation"&gt;Palfrey, Thomas R.; Srivastava, Sanjay; Postlewaite, A. (1993) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lZTls-JJSxgC&amp;pg=PA13 Bayesian Implementation.]'' Pg. 13-14. {{ISBN|3-7186-5314-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Pareto efficiency, an allocation of a resource is Pareto efficient if there is no other allocation of that resource that makes no one worse off while making some agents strictly better off.&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt; A limitation with the concept of Pareto efficiency is that it assumes that knowledge about other market participants is available to all participants, in that every player knows the payoffs and strategies available to other players so as to have complete information.&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt; Often, the players have types that are hidden from the other player.&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt;

==Overview==
The lack of complete information raises a question of when the efficiency calculation should be made.&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt; Should the efficiency check be made at the [[ex ante]] stage before the agent sees their types, at the interim stage after the agent sees their types, or at the [[ex post]] stage where the agent will have complete information about their types? Another issue is incentive.&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt; If a resource allocation rule is efficient but there is no incentive to abide by that rule or accept that rule, then the [[revelation principle]] asserts that there is no mechanism by which this allocation rule can be realized.&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt;

Bayesian efficiency overcomes problems of the [[Pareto efficiency]] by accounting for incomplete information, by addressing the timing of the evaluation (ex ante efficient, interim efficient, or ex post efficient), and by adding an incentive qualifier so that the allocation rule is incentive compatible.&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baltagi, Badi Hani. (2001) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qjBF3Z3xcWYC&amp;printsec=frontcover A Companion to Theoretical Econometrics.]'' Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|1-4051-0676-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayesian efficiency separately defines three types of efficiency: ex ante, interim, and ex post. For an allocation rule &lt;math&gt;x:T\to A&lt;/math&gt;:

''Ex ante efficiency'': &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is incentive compatible, and there exists no incentive compatible allocation rule &lt;math&gt;y:T\to A&lt;/math&gt; that

:&lt;math&gt;\int u^i(y(t),t)dG^i(t) \geq \int u^i(x(t),t)dG^i(t)&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, with strict inequality for some &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

''Interim efficiency'': &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is incentive compatible, and there exists no incentive compatible allocation rule &lt;math&gt;y:T\to A&lt;/math&gt; that

:&lt;math&gt;\int U^i(y(t),t)dG^i(t_{-i}|t_i) \geq \int U^i(x(t),t)dG^i(t_{-i}|t_i)&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;, with strict inequality for some &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;.

''Ex post efficiency'': &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is incentive compatible, and there exists no incentive compatible allocation rule &lt;math&gt;y:T\to A&lt;/math&gt; that

:&lt;math&gt;U^i(y(t),t) \geq U^i(x(t),t)&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, with strict inequality for some &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, &lt;math&gt;G^i&lt;/math&gt; are beliefs, &lt;math&gt;U^i&lt;/math&gt; are utility functions, and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; are agents. An ex ante allocation is always interim and ex post efficient, and an interim efficient allocation is always ex post efficient.&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt;

'''BonBon-Land''' is a Danish [[amusement park]] located in [[Holme Olstrup]] in the South of [[Zealand]], about 100km from [[Copenhagen]]. This 34-acre park attracts about 450.000 each season.
==History==
The history of theme park BonBon-land can be dated back to when the Danish sweets boiler Michael Spangsberg got an idea to produce wacky candy with such funny names as 'mågeklatter', 'hundeprutter' and 'tissebleer'.

From early on the candy became very popular, and children wanted to visit the factory in Holme Olstrup (a small Danish town in the countryside) to see how the cheeky and delicious pieces of candy were made. However, the production of the candy had to fulfil some very strict regulations concerning hygiene, so the factory couldn´t continue to offer visiting tours. As a result, Michael Spangsberg came up with yet another good idea - to open a small Bonbon-land.

In 1992, the theme park opened with a mini candy factory, a cinema, a shop and four small boats, shaped like a duck in a small pond. The park was an immediate success with children and over the years many rides and attractions have been added making, despite with adult-oriented contents and toilet humor throughout, Bonbon-Land one of Denmark´s most popular children´s parks (in 2008 it was the eight most popular tourist attraction in Denmark).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/danmark/da-dk/menu/turist/oplevelser/attraktioner/sightseeing/tophalvtreds.htm|title=Top 50 most visited attractions 2008|accessdate=27 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415234330/http://visitdenmark.com/danmark/da-dk/menu/turist/oplevelser/attraktioner/sightseeing/tophalvtreds.htm|archivedate=2009-04-15|deadurl=yes|date=15 April 2009}} ''VisitDanmark's homepage''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the Spanish-based entertainment company Parques Reunidos purchased the park.

In total, Parques Reunidos owns 67 theme parks around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parquesreunidos.com/ Owners of Bonbon Land] ''Parques Reunidos homepage'' Retrieved 27 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

From the beginning BonBon-land has focused on experiences that the whole family could enjoy. Today, Bonbon-land has over 60 different attractions and numerous activities on offer. Among the most popular rides in the park are the 4 roller coasters and the 2 water rides. There are also a number of playgrounds and a pirate track that visitors can try out. 

Up until 1998, BonBon-land had expanded its park to cover an area of 85.000 m² (21 acres). When the Beaver-Rafting course was finished in 1998, it was suddenly more than 110.000 m² (27 acres). Then in 2003, in connection with the opening of ’Vildsvinet’, the park expanded yet again to cover roughly 130.000 m² (32 acres), which is now its current size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonbonland.dk/textpage.aspx?pid=78|title=BonBon-Lands History|accessdate=27 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028150750/http://www.bonbonland.dk/textpage.aspx?pid=78#|archivedate=2010-10-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most expensive amusements are the rafting course with a price of 32 million DKK, 'Vildsvinet' from 2003, with an estimated price of 25 million DKK as well as 'Hankatten' that had a price of 20 million DKK. New amusements in 2010 are 'Svend Svingarm' and a brand new 4D cinema.

In 2012 it was ranked as one of the weirdest parks by ''Time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2106937_2106938_2106942,00.html|author=Samantha Grossman|title=Top 10 Weirdest Theme Parks - BonBon Land|work=Time|date=16 February 2012|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brazilian Zouk''' is a partner dance originating from [[Brazil]]. At first known as zouk-lambada, the dance is a descendant of [[lambada]], and it was danced to [[Lambada]] Music. Later on it was danced to [[Caribbean Zouk]] music, from where it got the name "Zouk". 
(the dance style originated in Brazil and the music style to be distinguished from each other). Brazilian Zouk came eventually to be danced to a broad set of music styles: [[R'n'b]], [[hip hop]], and [[pop music]], to name a few, and up to this day (2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864141760|title=Mzouk, mi pequeño gran mundo|last=Daniel|first=Estévez,|date=2013|publisher=D. Estévez López|others=Gómez, Esther Gómez Navalón|isbn=9788461617432|location=Barcelona|oclc=864141760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles==
Currently several styles of Brazilian Zouk have evolved. To name a few styles that are present among dance schools outside Brazil:
* '''Traditional Zouk''' (or Rio style zouk) is a more sensual, romantic and dramatic style of Brazilian zouk. 
* '''Lamba Zouk''' (or Zouk lambada, or Porto Seguro style) has the closest connection to [[Lambada]]. 
* '''Modern Zouk'''  is a highly diverse denomination to a group of styles, other than Traditional or Lamba Zouk. 
* '''Mzouk''' is the only style originated outside of [[Brazil]], but in Mallorca, [[Spain]] parallel to the other styles.
* '''Soulzouk''' regards itself as a philosophy of dance rather than styl,e with focus on [[Biomechanics]]

In addition and to these styles many professional zouk dancers have created and named their own derivations of Zouk, such as Flow Zouk, and Vero Zouk.

The '''British Amateur Press Association''' was an [[amateur press association]] created by comics fans in late 1977, following a proposal from Phil Greenaway in the letter pages of the [[comics]] [[fanzine]] ''Bemusing''; the first mailing (under the name ''PAPA'', the first initial standing for "Prime") was circulated in January 1978. Greenaway was the first [[Amateur press association#Organization|Central Mailer]] and his successors included Maureen "Mo" James, Howard Stangroom, Les Chester and [[Steve Green (science fiction activist)|Steve Green]]. For most of its existence, up to thirty members of BAPA submitted multiple copies of at least two [[ISO 216|A4]] pages to the central mailer every two months. BAPA was disbanded on 17 August 2004&lt;ref&gt;Dave Langford, 'Infinitely Improbable', ''Ansible'' 206, (September 2004) ISSN 0265-9816&lt;/ref&gt; with a final mailing distributed early in 2005. A one-off publication was also distributed under the name B-APA (sic) in 2005, in memory of Andy Roberts; a similar publication was announced in 2008, in memory of [[Steve Whitaker]].

Notable members of this association included [[Eddie Campbell]], [[Mark Finch]], [[Steve Green (science fiction activist)|Steve Green]], Martin Lock (later to launch [[Harrier Comics]]), Andy Roberts, Martin Skidmore (later editor of [[Trident Comics]]) and Steve Whitaker.

[[Image:TaborStore-BuckskinJoeCO.jpg|thumb|Horace Tabor's store was brought from the ghost town of Buckskin Joe to its namesake theme park]]

'''Buckskin Joe''' was a Western-style [[Amusement park|theme park]] and railway {{convert|8|mi|km}} west of [[Cañon City]], [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]]. It was located {{convert|1|mi|km}} south of [[U.S. Route 50 in Colorado|U.S. Route 50]] along the road to the [[Royal Gorge Bridge]]. Features of the park included gun fights, 30 authentic buildings from the Colorado 19th century frontier, themed entertainment, full service saloon and restaurant. There was also the Mystery House and a horse-drawn trolley ride. The town featured a donkey as the mayor. The mayor of Buckskin Joe resided in a small building and was allowed free range of the park. 

Buckskin Joe was built as a movie set in 1957 by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] director [[Malcolm F. Brown]], by bringing together old buildings from around central Colorado, and assembling them into an old western-style town.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_15989062 "Happy trails to "town" Buckskin Joe,"] ''Denver Post'', 4 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The name was taken from the former mining town, now ghost town, of Buckskin Joe, west of [[Fairplay, Colorado]]. The only building in the theme park from the original Buckskin Joe is the general store originally owned by Colorado pioneer [[Horace Tabor]]. In 1958 the owners began admitting tourists between filmings, and developed the location into a western theme park.

The Town of Terror, a later addition, was voted the best Halloween haunted attraction in Colorado two years in a row.{{Citation needed|date = November 2008}} Every October the staff of Buckskin Joe would transform the mild mannered attraction into a haunted attraction, capitalizing on the town's real haunted history. The town was also featured on the History Channel's "Haunted Rockies Series" for its unexplained happenings.{{Citation needed|date = November 2008}}

On September 2, 2010, owner Greg Tabuteau announced the sale of Buckskin Joe and its associated attraction the "[[Royal Gorge Scenic Railway]]", to an anonymous purchaser.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Burrous [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718221618/http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/Top-Story.asp?ID=14541 Buckskin Joe saddles up with a new owner]. The Daily Record (2010-9-2) canoncitydailyrecord.com&lt;/ref&gt;  The owner was later identified as Florida billionaire [[Bill Koch (businessman)|William Koch]] who plans to move the historic ghost town to his ranch near Gunnison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette.com/articles/buyer-124103-koch-mystery.html Mystery buyer for Buckskin Joe revealed to be billionaire Koch brother | buyer, koch, mystery – Colorado Springs Gazette, CO]. Gazette.com (2011-08-29). Retrieved on 2012-05-02.&lt;/ref&gt; The final day of operation for the town was September 12, 2010.

==Film location==
The town was a western movie filming location with more than 21 films to its credit, including ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', ''[[The Cowboys]]'' and ''The Sacketts''. The 1991 [[television]] feature ''[[Conagher]]'' starring [[Sam Elliott]], [[Katharine Ross]], [[Ken Curtis]] and [[Barry Corbin]] was filmed at Buckskin Joe. ''Conagher'' was the last film in which Curtis appeared.  The final movie to be filmed at Buckskin Joe was "[[Cactus Creek]]"; filming concluded just before the sale of the town was announced.&lt;ref&gt;Carie Canterbury [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718221549/http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/Top-Story.asp?ID=14420 Lights, Camera, Action].

The '''Carnival in the [[Dominican Republic]]''' is a Dominican celebration that takes place throughout February; although some Dominicans (rarely) celebrate it during [[Holy Week]] in March. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Janette Keys |url=http://www.colonialzone-dr.com/traditions-carnival.html |title=Carnaval Dominicano/ Dominican Republic Carnival Origin |website=Colonialzone-dr.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dominicans are usually most festive on February 27th, which is the Dominican Independence Day. In [[Santo Domingo]], celebrations include a large military display with the Dominican air force, navy, and army. Festivities often include the wearing of colorful costumes that symbolize Dominican religious and traditional characters such as ''Calife'', ''Guloya'', and ''Diablo Cojuelo''. Festivities take place all over the island, with each town adding its own twist to the celebration.

The "Christian" slave-owners who lived on the island would let their slaves have a celebration once a year so that they could get the "wild" out of their systems. The slave-owners considered this to be a "pagan" celebration, and therefore mixed "Christian" traditions into it and began to celebrate the event as well.

Evidence has been found in the ruins of La Vega Vieja (near the present day [[La Vega, Dominican Republic|La Vega]]) showing that Carnival has been celebrated in the Dominican Republic since 1510. The celebration originally consisted of the residents of the island dressing themselves as Moors and Christians.

Though it is not known for certain, it is thought that the colony of Santo Domingo was the first place in the Americas to have a [[Shrovetide|pre-Lenten]] costume. The celebration became a way to escape from the rigid religious traditions brought from the old world. By the late 1700s, the carnival had become a major celebration in the colony. Then on February 27, 1844, when the Dominican Republic won its independence from Haiti, the celebration grew even greater in popularity, as the country's Independence Day celebrations were combined into the pre-existing carnival celebrations.

==Symbols==
The celebration is symbolized by an "upside-down Chicken", and its main character is the "Diablo Cojuelo" (Limping Devil).

==Characters==
While there are many characters in the various versions of the carnival across the island, there are several prominent ones featured in most celebrations:

*'''Diablo Cojuelo''' (Limping Devil): is the main character of the carnival. A tale on the island says that this devil was banished to earth because of his childish pranks. When he hit the earth he hurt his leg, causing him to limp. While most of the communities across the island represent this character in different ways, several common practices are the use of a mask, a satanic suit, [[Jingle bell|sleigh bells]], and a whip or "Vejiga" (an animal bladder filled with air) to hit people in the streets (other "Diablos"). A Dominican tale claims that the mask is meant to represent the Spaniards who came to the island and enslaved and whipped the natives.
*'''Roba la Gallina''' (Steal the Chicken): is a festivity that satires the fact that some people used to steal chickens from farms. This often consists of a man dressing up as a woman who just stole a chicken. This character often carries a large purse with candy inside for the crowd and is meant to be one of the more comical characters. [http://casadecampoliving.com/carnival-characters-1-roba-la-gallina/]
*'''La Ciguapa''': is a female character who comes out at night. She is naked with very long black hair, and her feet are backwards. She enchants the men she comes across.
*'''Los Indios''' (The Indians): are a group of men and women dressed in the typical native Taino Indian attire. They travel together representing Dominican origins.

==Celebration Passion's parade==  
There are many ways in which the carnival is celebrated, although most celebrations have several similarities:
*They are held primarily on the main streets of the town or city.
*People gather in the streets to watch parades.
*Most of the disguised people carry a "Vejiga" or whip to hit people.
*Typical music such as merengue and bachata is played throughout the celebration to add some excitement to it.
*People wear colorful masks to represent religious figures.

Kehr and Kluckner were among first game design graduates of the Munich-based design academy MDH. Kehr, having developed board and card games since he was six years old, and Kluckner already having four years of experience as a programmer, started working together while still attending the university and created the base for a team of young graduates eager to work within the games industry. The team of [http://www.r-control.de/index_en.php remote control productions] provided the framework while the company's [[Managing Director]] Lesser took over a part of the management of Chimera Entertainment.

In May 2007 Chimera Entertainment received the LARA Start Up Award from the Bavarian Secretary of Commerce.  The first project of Chimera Entertainment was ''Windchaser'' ([[Personal computer|PC]]), a [[Real-time computing|real time]] [[tactical role-playing game]] set in Ensai, an original fantasy world created by Kehr himself.

June 2009 saw the release of ''Train your Brain with Dr. Kawashima'', created in cooperation with BBG Entertainment. This [[brain training]] application for [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[Macintosh|Mac]] is based on the studies of Japanese [[Neuroscientist]] [[Ryuta Kawashima]]. In cooperation with [[Bigpoint Games]] Chimera Entertainment released ''Warstory - Europe in Flames'', a [[Microsoft Silverlight]] Browsergame featuring [[Real-time computing|real time]] battles set in [[World War II]].

In the following years Chimera released several other games on various platforms with ''[[Angry Birds Epic]]'' ([[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Windows Phone]]) being the latest game made by Chimera Entertainment in cooperation with [[Rovio Entertainment|Rovio]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10582">The '''classical unities''', '''Aristotelian unities''', or '''three unities''' are rules for [[drama]] derived from a passage in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. In their [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] form they are as follows:

#''unity of action'': a play should have one action that it follows, with minimal subplots.
#''unity of time'': the action in a play should occur over a period of no more than 24 hours.
#''unity of place'': a play should exist in a single physical space and should not attempt to compress geography, nor should the stage represent more than one place.

==Aristotle's unities==
Aristotle dealt with the unity of action in some detail, under the general subject of "definition of tragedy", where he wrote: "serious, complete in itself and of a certain magnitude". 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, according to our definition, Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is complete, and whole, and of a certain magnitude&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/ari/poe/poe08.htm Aristotle's ''Poetics'', VII].&lt;/ref&gt; … As therefore, in the other imitative arts, the imitation is one when the object imitated is one, so the plot, being an imitation of an action, must imitate one action and that a whole, the structural union of the parts being such that, if any one of them is displaced or removed, the whole will be disjointed and disturbed. For a thing whose presence or absence makes no visible difference, is not an organic part of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/ari/poe/poe09.htm Aristotle's ''Poetics'', VIII].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His only reference to the time in the fictive world is in a distinction between the [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[tragedy|tragic]] forms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Epic poetry agrees with Tragedy in so far as it is an imitation in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] of characters of a higher type. They differ, in that Epic poetry admits but one kind of metre, and is narrative in form. They differ, again, in their length: for Tragedy endeavours, as far as possible, to confine itself to a single revolution of the sun, or but slightly to exceed this limit; whereas the Epic action has no limits of time.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle's ''Poetics'', V.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike his prescriptive attitude regarding the plot (unity of action), Aristotle here merely remarks on the typical duration of a tragedy's action, and does not suggest any kind of imperative that it always ought to be so. He was writing after the golden age of [[Greek drama]], and many [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] playwrights wrote plays that do not fit within these conventions.

Aristotle does not actually mention the neoclassical unity of place at all. However, the prevalent interpretation of his ''Poetics'' during the Middle Ages inclined toward interpreting his comment on time as another "unity".

==European literature==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
[[Italy|Italian]] critics of the 16th century, from [[Lodovico Castelvetro]] onwards, and then [[French literature of the 17th century|17th-century French]] critics, proponents of the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] movement, both expanded Aristotle's descriptions. The result was to make them into prescriptions for structuring plays.  French drama of the 17th century, particularly that of [[Molière]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]], was highly regular, and [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]] incurred harsh criticism for departing from the unities in ''[[Le Cid]]''. The [[England|English]] dramatists writing for the [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan and Jacobean stage]] were largely unaware of these structures.

By the later 17th century, however, English dramatists (under the influence of French criticism picked up by those in exile during the [[English Interregnum]]) did begin to assess their own plays according to these rules. Thus, [[John Dryden]], among many others, compares the "irregular" [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] (only two of Shakespeare's plays conform to the unities – ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'' and ''[[The Tempest]]'') with the "regular" [[Dryden]] in his ''[[Essay of Dramatick Poesie]]'' (1668), and makes use of the unity of time in this passage criticizing [[Shakespearean histories|Shakespeare's history plays]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;... if you consider the Historical Playes of Shakespeare, they are rather so many Chronicles of Kings, or the business many times of thirty or forty years, crampt into a representation of two hours and a half, which is not to imitate or paint Nature, but rather to draw her in miniature, to take her in little; to look upon her through the wrong end of a Perspective, and receive her Images not onely much less, but infinitely more imperfect then the life: this instead of making a Play delightful, renders it ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, ''An Essay of Dramatick Poesie'' (1668), para. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Dryden declared Shakespeare "incomparable" because of his disregard for convention:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... in most of the irregular Playes of Shakespeare or [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher]] (for Ben Johnson's are for the most part regular) there is a more masculine fancy and greater spirit in all the writing, then[sic] there is in any of the French.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, ''An Essay of Dramatick Poesie'' (1668), para. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Alexander Pope]] criticizes the violation of the unities in his ''[[Dunciad]]''.  In the 1728 version of the poem, the goddess Dulness notes that "Time himself stands still at her command,/ Realms shift their place, and Ocean turns to land" (''Dunciad'' 1728, i, 69&amp;ndash;70).  Additionally, he notes a violation of unity of action, as tragedy and comedy were mixed.

[[Samuel Johnson]], too, applied the unities to drama in his ''Prefaces to Shakespeare''. He was well aware that Aristotle had only recommended the unity of action, and knew that rules must serve drama, not vice versa:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whether Shakespeare knew the unities, and rejected them by design, or deviated from them by happy ignorance, it is, I think, impossible to decide, and useless to inquire. We may reasonably suppose, that, when he rose to notice, he did not want the counsels and admonitions of scholars and critics, and that he at last deliberately persisted in a practice, which he might have begun by chance. As nothing is essential to the fable, but unity of action, and as the unities of time and place arise evidently from false assumptions, and, by circumscribing the extent of the drama, lessen its variety, I cannot think it much to be lamented, that they were not known by him, or not observed: Nor, if such another poet could arise, should I very vehemently reproach him, that his first act passed at Venice, and his next in Cyprus. Such violations of rules merely positive, become the comprehensive genius of Shakespeare…&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''Preface to his Edition of Shakespeare's Plays (1765),'' ff. a7r&amp;ndash;a7v, para. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Pitcher]], in his [[Arden Shakespeare]] Third Series edition of ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' (2010), argues that Shakespeare was familiar with the unities due to an English translation of ''Poetics'' that became popular around 1608, and that &lt;i&gt;The Winter's Tale&lt;/i&gt; is intentionally breaking all the rules.

The classical unities were influential in dramatic criticism until [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'' (1830); one of the things that made that play controversial at its debut was its violation of these rules of [[classicism]]. In the Spanish theatrical tradition, there is [[Lope de Vega]]'s ''Arte nuevo de hacer comedias'' of 1609, which is a defense of the new form for writing and representation of [[Spanish Golden Age|Golden Age]] Spanish theatre. Lope's ''Arte nuevo'' is a 389 verse poem which explicitly defends his and other dramaturges, distancing from Aristotelian unities of theatre.

'''Colleen Madigan''' (born January 22, 1964) is an American politician and [[social worker]] from [[Maine]]. Under the name Colleen Lachowicz, the [[Maine Democratic Party|Democrat]] from [[Waterville, Maine|Waterville]] was elected to the [[Maine Senate]] from the 25th District. Her race attracted international attention when the [[Republican Party of Maine]] issued press releases condemning her for playing the online video game ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', claiming her "disturbing alter-ego" and "time-consuming double life" made her unfit to hold public office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2213180/Colleen-Lachowicz-Maine-state-senate-candidate-outed-World-Warcraft-player.html#ixzz28TMQICcJ Zennie, Michael. "Democrat state senate candidate's 'disturbing double life' as 'Santiaga' a level 85 orc assassin in World of Warcraft" ''[[Daily Mail]]'' 4 October 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlinesentinel.com/politics/Lachowicz.html Shepherd, Michael. "Maine Republicans attack candidate for playing World of Warcraft" ''Morning Sentinel'' October 4, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; She was defeated for re-election two years later by Republican [[Scott Cyrway]].

She returned to her maiden name, Colleen Madigan, in 2014 and was elected to the [[Maine House of Representatives]]'s District 110 in 2016, winning with 2305 votes to 1661 for Republican Mark Andre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/maine-state-house-district-110 "Maine State House District 110" ''New York Times'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="colleenmadigan.com"&gt;[http://www.colleenmadigan.com Colleen Madigan] "2016 campaign web site".&lt;/ref&gt; (Democratic incumbent [[Henry Beck]] was not a candidate for re-election, and Madigan was unopposed in the primary.)

== Background ==
Coleen Madigan was born January 22, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlinesentinel.com/community/2012-central-maine-candidates.html "Central Maine House and Senate Candidates 2012"] ''[[Morning Sentinel]]''.

Retrieved November 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to her campaign biography, Lachowicz had been working since she was 15 years old. After graduating from [[William Paterson College]] with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[sociology]] in 1987, she worked with adults with mental illness, then spent a year in Eastern Europe providing supportive counseling services to international students. She returned to the U.S., and earned a [[Master of Social Work]] from [[Boston College]] in 1999. She has spent 25 years as a social worker and lives in Waterville.&lt;ref name="onlinesentinel.com"&gt;[http://www.onlinesentinel.com/news/district-25-democrats-similar-different_2012-06-01.html Calder, Amy.] "District 25 Democrats similar, different; Senate hopefuls from Waterville to face off June 12 in primary" ''[[Morning Sentinel]]'' June 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2012 Election ==
Lachowicz, a long-time Democratic activist and advocate on women's issues, won a June 12, 2012 primary election against Dana Hernandez, with 827 votes (52.3%) to Hernandez' 755 (47.7%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/files/elections/2012/by_state/ME_Page_0612.html?SITE=CSPANELN&amp;SECTION=POLITICS ''C-SPAN'', "AP Election Results - Maine Summary Vote Totals"]&lt;/ref&gt; She faced Martin, who ran unopposed in his own primary, on November 6, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/2012/2012candidate.pdf ''Maine Secretary of State'' "Primary Candidate List," June 12, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018012341/http://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/2012/2012candidate.pdf |date=October 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 25th district covers [[Albion, Maine|Albion]], [[Benton, Maine|Benton]], [[Clinton, Maine|Clinton]], [[Unity, Kennebec County, Maine|Unity Township]], Waterville and [[Winslow, Maine|Winslow]] in [[Kennebec County, Maine|Kennebec County]], and [[Detroit, Maine|Detroit]] and [[Pittsfield, Maine|Pittsfield]] in [[Somerset County, Maine|Somerset County]].&lt;ref name="onlinesentinel.com"/&gt;

=== Attack on Lachowicz and gaming ===
The website "Colleen's World" was set up by the Republican Party of Maine to [[outing|"out"]] her as a player of the [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' (her "main" character is a level 100 [[orc#Warcraft|orc]] [[rogue (character class)#Other games|rogue]] named Santiaga).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colleensworld.com Colleen's World | The Online World of Maine State Senate Candidate Colleen LachowiczColleen's World]&lt;/ref&gt; The site displayed several messages posted by Lachowicz to sites such as ''[[The Daily Kos]]'', stating her desire to "go and hunt down [[Grover Norquist]] and drown HIM in [her] bathtub" (referencing a comment Norquist made on shrinking the government "to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub")&lt;ref name="1115.ORG"&gt;{{cite web | title=Maybe They Forgot What "Conservative" Means | url=http://www.1115.org/2004/09/28/maybe-they-forgot-what-conservative-means/ | year=2004 | accessdate=September 28, 2004 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022165714/http://www.1115.org/2004/09/28/maybe-they-forgot-what-conservative-means/ | archivedate=October 22, 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and comments about stabbing and poisons (in ''World of Warcraft'', rogues rely heavily on daggers and poisons).&lt;ref&gt;{{wowpedia|Rogue}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website said "In Colleen’s online fantasy world, she gets away with crude, vicious and violent comments" and "Maine needs a State Senator that lives in the real world, not in Colleen’s fantasy world." They also sent out a press release titled "Disturbing Alter-Ego Revealed" which accused her of living a "time-consuming double life."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19842704 'World of Warcraft hobby sparks US political row' BBC News: Technology 5 October, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/ingame/republicans-out-democrat-world-warcraft-witch-hunt-6283586 Benedetti, Winda.

In response, Lachowicz said, "I think it’s weird that I’m being targeted for playing online games. Apparently I’m in good company since there are 183 million other Americans who also enjoy online games. What’s next? Will I be ostracized for playing ''[[Angry Birds]]'' or ''[[Words with Friends]]''?" She added, "What’s really weird is that the Republicans are going after my hobbies instead of talking about their record while they’ve been running Augusta for the last two years. Instead of talking about what they’re doing for Maine people, they’re making fun of me for playing video games. Did you know that more people over the age of 50 play video games than under the age of 18? As a gamer, I’m in good company with folks like [[Jodie Foster]], [[Vin Diesel]], [[Mike Myers]], and [[Robin Williams]]. Maybe it’s the Republican Party that is out of touch."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colleenlachowicz.com/?p=106 Lachowicz, Colleen. "Statement on Attacks" Official website; October 4, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin said he was unaware of the party's attacks on Lachowicz until contacted by reporters, and he didn’t condone them. Both candidates were declared "clean election candidates," meaning they were both pledged to abstain from negative campaigning, and could only spend the amount they receive from [[Clean Elections|public financing]] and a limited amount of donations. A number of gamers raised money for organizations which support Lachowicz' candidacy, since her campaign could not solicit or receive any donations;&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.actblue.com/page/santiaga "Friends of Santiaga: Support A Gamer Who's Under Attack" page at actblue.com]&lt;/ref&gt; but she said she would rather not become the poster girl for a game she had almost completely stopped playing due to time pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82074.html Friess, Steve. "'Warcraft' candidate: Gaming is misunderstood" Politico.com October 5, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The Maine Republican Party filed an ethics complaint, alleging that she cheated by posting on the ActBlue website, and claiming that this constituted improperly coordinating with political action committees to solicit campaign contributions. The [[bipartisan]] Maine Ethics Commission rejected this accusation by a 5-0 vote in Lachowicz’s favor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bangordailynews.com/2012/11/01/politics/ethics-commission-clears-world-of-warcraft-candidate-of-wrongdoing/ Stone, Matthew. "Ethics commission clears ''World of Warcraft'' candidate of wrongdoing" ''[[Bangor Daily News]]'' November 1, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The attacks attracted international attention, including articles from [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']], the [[BBC]], [[Forbes (magazine)|''Forbes'']], [[Slate.com]], [[Politico.com]] and a piece on the satirical news program ''[[The Colbert Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://techland.time.com/2012/10/10/maine-republican-party-playing-world-of-warcraft-makes-you-unfit-for-office/#ixzz28uP5JRjX Peckham, Matt.

=== Endorsements ===
On October 11, 2012, the [[Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee]] declared Lachowicz one of their "2012 Essential Races: Grassroots Nominees", stating that she had received the second-largest number of nominations from grassroots activists. Referencing the ''World of Warcraft'' attack, the DLCC claimed that the controversy had made hers "perhaps the most nationally-watched legislative race in the country right now".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlcc.org/2012Races_Grassroots_choices "2012 Essential Races: Grassroots Nominees", Democratic Legislative Leadership Committee website; October 11, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015011734/http://dlcc.org/2012Races_Grassroots_choices |date=October 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outcome ===
Lachowicz was the winner in the general election, unseating Martin with 8,666 votes to his 7,753. Her overwhelming majority in Waterville (4,224 to 2,318) overcame her opponent's narrow leads in all the other municipalities: he won Winslow by 2,007-1,921, Pittsfield 990-702, Detroit 179-163, Clinton 837-705, Benton 824-579; and Albion 598-372.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlinesentinel.com/news/Lachowicz-has-early-lead-in-state-Senate-25-race.html Calder, Amy.

'''''Con Man''''' is an American comedy web series created, written, directed by, and starring [[Alan Tudyk]]. The series follows cult science fiction actor Wray Nerely (Tudyk), as he tours the [[fan convention|convention]] circuit.

== Plot ==
Wray Nerely (Tudyk) is a struggling actor who starred as a spaceship pilot on ''Spectrum'', a canceled science fiction series that went on to become a cult classic. Wray's good friend Jack Moore (Nathan Fillion), who starred as the ship's captain, has become an [[A-list]] movie star.  Frustrated by Jack's success and his lack thereof, Wray travels the science fiction convention circuit, makes appearances at comic book stores, and visits pop culture events. He navigates the odd people and incidents he encounters along the way while learning to love the fans he has.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Firefly’ Stars Alan Tudyk, Nathan Fillion Reunite for Crowdfunded ‘Con Man’ Series|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/con-man-alan-tudyk-nathan-fillion-series-firefly-1201450339/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Dave|last=McNary|date=March 11, 2015|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SlashFilm"&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Firefly’ Friends Alan Tudyk and Nathan Fillion Reunite For Web Series ‘Con Man’|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/con-man-alan-tudyk-nathan-fillion/|work=[[SlashFilm]]|first=Germain|last=Lussier|date=March 11, 2015|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cast ==

=== Main cast ===
* [[Alan Tudyk]] as Wray Nerely, a struggling actor who formerly starred on ''Spectrum'' as pilot Cash Wayne. To his dissatisfaction, he is pigeonholed into science fiction roles, the only non–science fiction role being an episode of ''[[Justified (TV series)|Justified]]''.{{refn|group=note|Tudyk's guest appearance in an episode of ''Justified'' was credited as Wray Nerely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bierly|first1=Mandi|title='Justified' postmortem: EP Graham Yost dissects 'Shot All to Hell'|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/02/05/justified-shot-all-to-hell/2 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=October 14, 2015|date=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Tudyk said of his character, "Wray struggles with his career and he's very unhappy in his career. Even though he's a huge star at conventions, he comes home to his one-bedroom apartment and hopes to get a guest star spot on ''NCIS: Topeka''."&lt;ref name="CNET"&gt;{{cite web|title='Firefly' stars reunite for crowdfunded Web series|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/firefly-stars-reunite-for-crowdfunded-webseries-about-cons/|work=[[CNET]]|first=Amanda|last=Kooser|date=March 11, 2015|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wray's former role as a pilot on a canceled science fiction show and later cult hit is a nod to Tudyk's role on ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''.&lt;ref name="variety" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TheHollywoodNews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly" /&gt;
* [[Nathan Fillion]] as Jack Moore, Wray's good friend who formerly starred on ''Spectrum'' as Captain James Raaker. Unlike Wray, Jack has "gone on to incredible action-hero stardom, like [[Matt Damon]]" and so "is a daily reminder of what Wray wishes he had".&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="io9"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nathan Fillion and Alan Tudyk Return To Fandom In New Series ''Con Man'' |url=http://io9.com/nathan-fillion-and-alan-tudyk-return-to-fandom-in-new-s-1690725690 |publisher=[[io9]] |first=Jason |last=Shankel |date=March 11, 2015|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tudyk said of Fillion's involvement, "Nathan was an obvious choice for this project from the beginning. I’ve wanted to work with him again since ''Firefly'', really."&lt;ref name="BuzzFeed" /&gt; Jack's former role as a captain on a canceled science fiction show and later cult hit is a nod to Fillion's role on ''Firefly''.&lt;ref name="variety" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TheHollywoodNews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly" /&gt;
* [[Mindy Sterling]] as Bobbie, Wray's [[Talent agent|booking agent]]. She receives fifteen percent of everything Wray receives, and to increase this amount, she downgrades Wray's flights and accommodations so the convention will pay him the difference in cash. Though it is observed she is not conventionally attractive, she often has sex with convention guests. She was formerly an actress and, though is not famous, has a varied filmography ranging from a science fiction [[B movie]] to [[snuff film]]s. Tudyk stated Bobbie is his favorite character and said she "represents the 'carnie' aspect of the conventions".&lt;ref name="SlugMag" /&gt;

=== Recurring cast ===
Of the "kooky" people who populate the series, Tudyk emphasized, "the kooky people in ''Con Man'' are not the fans. [The fans] are the heroes of this. The kooky people are the people who work in the conventions. [...] It's the people that we've met along the way that are pulling the strings behind the curtain, in addition to kooky celebrities."&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly" /&gt;
* [[Casper Van Dien]] as John Boutell, the [[bartender]] at every bar, regardless of its location.
* [[Sean Astin]] as himself, an actor who played [[Samwise Gamgee]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film series. While he advises Wray to accept his status as a beloved cult icon and gladly interacts with his fans, he also encourages Wray to use the fans' devotion for material gain, such as to upgrade his flight from coach to first class.
* [[Ari Stidham]] as 1st class fan, a ''Spectrum'' fan. He reneges on an agreement to give his first-class plane seat to Wray if Wray signs multiple items, causing Wray to later refuse to return the fan's "lucky pen". The fan reveals this during a panel, foiling Wray's attempt to calm the enraged audience. He is among those who chase Wray.
* [[Felicia Day]] as Karen, Wray's enthusiastic assistant for the duration of the convention he attends in episodes two through four. She always dresses exactly as he does in case she needs to be his decoy, and because of this, he is able to escape an enraged group of fans.
* [[Nolan North]] as Jerry Lansing, a [[motion capture]] artist, second best after [[Andy Serkis]], and self-proclaimed "mocap king". He reappears in "Voiced Over" recording voice-over work for a video game. The character was originally named Nigel Thrice; Jerry Lansing was a character originally created by North while he worked on the ''[[Uncharted]]'' series.
* [[Tricia Helfer]] as Louise, a woman attending a doll convention who treats her baby dolls as if they are real infants. Though Wray finds this behavior creepy, he becomes enamored with her and strives to gain her affection. Their short-lived relationship ends when Wray breaks her porcelain doll Isabelle in "Doll Faced".
* [[Leslie Jordan]] as himself, an actor. Though he is widely believed to be gay, he admits to Wray that he is pretending so that he can attract older [[Conservatism|politically conservative]] women through the "corrosive black lie" that sexuality is a choice. He becomes enamored with Bobbie, especially after she convinces him she is conservative.
* [[Sean Maher]] as himself, a gay actor who starred in the ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' television series and the related film ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]''. He mistakenly believes Bobbie is male, then interprets Wray's correction as she is [[transgender]], and becomes enamored with her and how "courageous" he perceives her to be.
* [[Alison Haislip]] as Faith, Jack Moore's new assistant who oversees his day to day schedule. As a fan of the original series ''Spectrum'', she starts a flirty relationship with Wray although someone or something always seems to come between them.
* [[Liza Lapira]] as Brenda, an actress who played Dr. Chu on ''Spectrum''.
* [[Henry Rollins]] as Stutter, an actor who played Hashen on ''Spectrum''.
* [[Skyler Day]] as Tiffany, an actress who played Ketheria on ''Spectrum''.
* Skylar Haarsma as Young Tiffany, during the time ''Spectrum'' was on the air.
* [[Amy Acker]] as Dawn, an actress who played Bree on ''Spectrum''.

| ShortSummary    = Wray Nerely flies to a weekend-long convention, and to his dismay, he is in [[Coach class|coach]]. In the bathroom, he reluctantly signs a magazine cover featuring his ''Spectrum'' costar Jack Moore. He receives a call about a [[Clint Eastwood]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] film, but because he cannot audition in person, he must send a taped audition instead. When Wray expresses discontent over fan interactions, [[Sean Astin]] (himself) encourages him to accept his status as beloved cult figure and use it to upgrade his seat. Astin's use of the word "retard" in the sense of "to impede or hinder" encourages Wray to say it. A ''Spectrum'' fan in first-class (Ari Stidham) reneges on the agreement to switch seats with Wray when Astin convinces another fan out of the adjacent seat. Wray is forced to his seat by the [[flight attendant]] (Samantha Smith) and [[Federal Air Marshal Service|Federal Air Marshal]] Cahoots ([[Wil Wheaton]]).

They quickly work through Wray's autograph line that he can rehearse the Eastwood script. Bobbie's loud insistence forces Wray to accept her help.

Jerry Lansing ([[Nolan North]]) gives Wray a painkiller for his back, though warns that it is potent with alcohol.

The meet and greet turns into a night of hard drinking and partying.

Karen acts as a decoy, and he escapes. Astin reports that an online video of Wray talking about the film cost him the role. Wray gives Astin fan-made [[bourbon ball]]s, which induce diarrhea, as payback for encouraging Wray to use the word "retard".

Doc Farrow) helps Wray escape.

== Production ==

=== Conception and development ===
Tudyk developed the series based on his experiences as an actor touring the science fiction convention circuit. Though it is not autobiographical, the fictional ''Spectrum'' echoes ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', a canceled science fiction series-turned-cult hit that starred Tudyk as a pilot and Fillion as a captain, and Wray's experiences draw heavily on incidents and people Tudyk and Fillion encountered at conventions.&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Firefly'' stars launch Indiegogo campaign for web series ''Con Man'': 'It's the quickest way to see us back on a spaceship'|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/10/firefly-stars-nathan-fillion-and-alan-tudyk-launch-indiegogo-campaign-web-series|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Clark|last=Collins|date=March 11, 2015|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BuzzFeed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HitFix"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Alan Tudyk and Nathan Fillion on comic-cons and their new webseries 'Con Men'|url=http://www.hitfix.com/harpy/interview-alan-tudyk-and-nathan-fillion-on-comic-cons-and-their-new-webseries-con-men|work=[[HitFix]]|first=Donna|last=Dickens|date=March 11, 2015|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Spectrum'' is based on a prequel novel to ''[[The Softwire]]'' series currently being written by [[PJ Haarsma]], who is also a producer of ''Con Man''.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nathan Fillion and Alan Tudyk on "Con Man": We can't wait to get started|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nathan-fillion-and-alan-tudyk-on-con-man-we-cant-wait-to-get-started/|work=[[CBS]]|first=Lauren|last=Moraski|date=March 17, 2015|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tudyk said in March 2015 that the concept had been in development for two years.&lt;ref name="TheHollywoodNews"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Mike|title=Exclusive Interview: Alan Tudyk Talks ‘Con Man’ And ‘Firefly’|url=http://www.thehollywoodnews.com/2015/03/25/exclusive-interview-alan-tudyk-talks-con-man-and-firefly/|accessdate=March 30, 2015|work=The Hollywood News|date=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pitched the idea to a production company, which became interested in producing the series and began to draw up contracts. However, the company's funder left the company, and the series was dropped.&lt;ref name="BuzzFeed"&gt;{{cite web|title=7 Things You Need To Know About Nathan Fillion And Alan Tudyk’s New Web Series|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/keelyflaherty/things-you-need-to-know-about-nathan-fillion-and-alan-tudy|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|first=Keely|last=Flaherty|date=March 11, 2015|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tudyk spent a year meeting with producers but was disappointed. When asked to find an audience beyond "weird convention nerds," he refused, believing it to be compromising the concept of ''Con Man'' and disrespecting fans.&lt;ref name="DigitalSpy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alan Tudyk on new web series Con Man and why he loves his fans|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/interviews/a634986/alan-tudyk-on-new-web-series-con-man-and-why-he-loves-his-fans.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Morgan|last=Jeffrey|date=March 12, 2015|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series premiered on September 30, 2015, on [[Vimeo]], with the first season consisting of 13 episodes. The second season premiered on December 8, 2016 on Comic-Con HQ, Comic-Con's subscription streaming video service, consisted of 12 episodes, and concluded on January 26, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blastr.com/2016-5-6/alan-tudyks-web-series-con-man-gets-new-home-season-2|title=Alan Tudyk's web series Con Man gets a new home for Season 2|work=[[Blastr]]|first=Aaron|last=Sagers|date=May 6, 2016|accessdate=July 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/11/30/comic-con-hq-streaming-service-con-man-season-2-trailer|title=Check out Alan Tudyk, Nathan Fillion in new trailer for Comic Con HQ series 'Con Man'|work=Mashable|first=Saba|last=Hamedy|date=December 1, 2016|accessdate=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, the series was acquired by [[Syfy]] and had its television debut on September 9, 2017. The web series was shown as is but the episodes were combined to produce half-hour installments for airing, with all thirteen episodes of the first season aired back-to-back on the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2017/08/happy-premiere-date-syfy-superstition-ghost-wars-z-nation-van-helsing-1202156371/ |title=Syfy Sets Premiere Dates For New Series ‘Happy!’, ‘Superstition’ &amp; ‘Ghost Wars’ Along With Returning Shows |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |first=Erik |last=Pedersen |date=August 25, 2017 |accessdate=September 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indiewire-2017jul21"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/07/syfy-con-man-broadcast-september-1201858456/ |title=Syfy Acquires 'Con Man,' Adding Alan Tudyk's Emmy-Nominated Indie Comedy To Its Lineup — Exclusive |website=[[IndieWire]] |date=July 21, 2017 |first=Liz Shannon |last=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the reception of the television network broadcast goes well and viewer ratings are sufficient, the network may decide to fund future seasons.&lt;ref name="indiewire-2017jul21" /&gt;

=== Crowdfunding campaign ===
On March 10, 2015, Tudyk, Fillion, and Haarsma launched a campaign to raise funds for the series on crowdfunding website [[Indiegogo]] with a target goal of $425,000 to produce three ten-minute episodes.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; In 24 hours, the campaign raised over $1 million, setting a one-day record for a crowdfunded web series.&lt;ref name="Deadline"&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Con Man’ Web Series From Nathan Fillion And Alan Tudyk Smashing Crowdfunding Records|url=http://deadline.com/2015/03/browncoats-give-1-6-million-for-fillion-tudyk-web-series-1201392389/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Ross|last=Lincoln|date=March 13, 2015|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ScreenDaily"/&gt; In 35 hours, it raised over $1.4 million, breaking the overall web series crowdfunding record set by the campaign for ''[[TableTop (web series)|TableTop]]''{{'}}s Season Three.&lt;ref name="ScreenDaily"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alan Tudyk &amp; Nathan Fillion's 'Con Man' breaks crowdfunding record|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/tudyk-and-fillions-con-man-breaks-crowdfunding-record/5084231.article|work=[[ScreenDaily.com]]|first=Ian|last=Sandwell|date=March 13, 2015|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJRecord"&gt;{{cite web|title=Not-Exactly- ‘Firefly’ Comedy Sequel Nears a Crowdfunding Record|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/03/12/not-exactly-firefly-comedy-sequel-nears-a-crowdfunding-record/|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|first=Don|last=Steinberg|date=March 12, 2015|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheWrap"&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Firefly’ Alums Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk Shatter Indiegogo Record by Raising $1 Million in Less Than 24 Hours|url=http://www.thewrap.com/firefly-alums-nathan-fillion-alan-tudyk-shatter-indiegogo-record-by-raising-1-million-in-less-than-24-hours/|work=[[TheWrap]]|first=Matt|last=Donnelly|date=March 12, 2015|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign set a stretch goal of $1.75 million to produce a full season of 12 episodes, as Tudyk planned, plus a "lost" episode of the fictional ''Spectrum''.&lt;ref name="ScreenDaily"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite web|title='Firefly's' Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk reunite for 'Con Man' Web series|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-firefly-fillion-tudyk-reunite-con-man-web-series-20150313-story.html|work=[[LA Times]]|first=Patrick Kevin|last=Day|date=March 13, 2015|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was met on March 14, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PJ Haarsma on Twitter: "1.7 Wow!

The decision to use crowdfunding came out of Tudyk and Fillion's desire to work with people who knew the world of conventions, would enjoy being involved, and did not disrespect fans and their world. Tudyk said, "It's something that just made sense. This world of Cons, of the sci-fi conventions, is built by the fans."&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|title = Alan Tudyk and Nathan Fillion launch Indiegogo Campaign for Con Man|url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/11/alan-tudyk-and-nathan-fillion-launch-indiegogo-campaign-for-con-man|work = [[IGN]]|first = Matt|last = Fowler|date = March 11, 2015|accessdate = March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fillion said, "This project in the hands of the fans is the only place it will be safe."&lt;ref name="CNET"/&gt;

=== Casting ===
The launch of crowdfunding campaign announced that it would be drawing from talent in science fiction and named several guest stars: [[Seth Green]], [[Felicia Day]], [[James Gunn (filmmaker)|James Gunn]], [[Gina Torres]], [[Sean Maher]], and [[Amy Acker]].&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Indiegogo" /&gt; Later, [[Tricia Helfer]], [[Michael Trucco]], [[Nolan North]], [[Emily Kinney]], [[Robert Patrick]], [[Mindy Sterling]], and [[Samantha Smith (actress)|Samantha Smith]] were announced as cast members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nerdist.com/exclusive-seven-more-stars-announced-for-alan-tudyk-and-nathan-fillions-web-series-con-man/|title = Exclusive: Seven More Stars Announced for Alan Tudyk and Nathan Fillion’s Web Series|date = March 30, 2015|accessdate = March 30, 2015|website = [[Nerdist Industries|The Nerdist]]|publisher = |last = McCabe|first = Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kinney later left the project because filming dates conflicted with her musical tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nlnro/iama_singersongwriteractor_emily_kinney_ama/cvp6b0r|title = IamA Singer/songwriter-Actor, Emily Kinney!

==Early life==
Von Teese was born in [[Rochester, Michigan]], the second of three daughters.&lt;ref name="TimesNakAmb"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/celebrity/article4757809.ece|title=Dita von Teese's naked ambition|last=McLean|first=Craig|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=September 20, 2008|accessdate=September 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a [[machinist]] and her mother a [[manicurist]].&lt;ref name="TimesNakAmb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Art of Teese"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/main.jhtml?xml=/fashion/2006/03/06/efdita04.xml|title=Art of the Teese|last=West|first=Naomi|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=June 3, 2006|accessdate=February 17, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911072009/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/main.jhtml?xml=%2Ffashion%2F2006%2F03%2F06%2Fefdita04.xml|archivedate=September 11, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is of [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Armenian people|Armenian]], and [[German people|German]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/DitaVonTeese/status/356816050005872642 Official Twitter]. Twitter.com (July 15, 2013). Retrieved on August 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Dita has stated that one of her grandmothers was half-Armenian and adopted into an Anglo-Saxon American family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://style.news.am/eng/news/2804/my-grandmother-was-half-armenian---exclusive-interview-with-dita-von-teese.html|title=My grandmother was half Armenian – exclusive interview with Dita Von Teese|publisher=style.news.am|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Teese is known for her fascination with [[1940s in film|1940s cinema]] and classic vintage style. This began at a young age and was fostered by her mother, who would buy clothes for her daughter to dress up. Her mother was a fan of old, [[Cinema of the United States#Golden Age of Hollywood|Golden Age-era Hollywood films]], and from her Von Teese developed a fascination with the actresses of that day, especially [[Betty Grable]].

She was classically trained as a ballet dancer from an early age, and danced solo at age 13 for a local ballet company. Though she originally wanted to be a [[ballerina]], Von Teese states that "by 15, I was as good as I'd ever be."&lt;ref name="The Art of Teese"/&gt; She was later to incorporate this element into her burlesque shows, where she frequently goes ''[[en pointe]]''. The family relocated from Michigan to [[Orange County, California]], when her father's job moved.&lt;ref name="TimesNakAmb"/&gt; Von Teese attended [[University High School (Irvine, California)|University High School]] in [[Irvine, California]].&lt;ref name="ocregister"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/life/features/lifestyle/article_1086656.php|title=Dita Von Teese: Call her old-fashioned|last=Nguyen|first=Katherine|work=[[Orange County Register]]|date=April 6, 2006|accessdate=February 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Von Teese was a teenager, her mother took her to buy her first [[bra]], made from plain white cotton, and gave her a plastic egg containing a pair of wrinkly, flesh-colored [[pantyhose]].&lt;ref name=ocregister/&gt; Von Teese says she was disappointed, as she had been hoping to receive beautiful lacy garments and stockings, of the type she had glimpsed in her father's ''[[Playboy]]'' magazines. This fueled her passion for lingerie. She worked in a lingerie store as a salesgirl when she was 15, eventually as a [[buyer]]. Von Teese has been fond of wearing elaborate lingerie such as [[corset]]s and [[Basque (clothing)|basques]] with [[fully fashioned stockings]] ever since. In college, Von Teese studied historic [[costuming]] and aspired to work as a [[Wardrobe stylist|stylist]] for films. She is a trained [[costume designer]], often designing (and [[copyright]]ing) her photo shoots herself.&lt;ref name=burlesqueisback&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/theater/160251_burlesque12.html|title=Burlesque is Back|last=Dizon|first=Kristen|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=February 12, 2004|accessdate=March 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Von Teese chose her stage name by adopting the name Dita as a tribute to silent film actress [[Dita Parlo]]. For her breakthrough December 2002 ''Playboy'' cover, she was required to have a surname, so she chose ''Von Treese'' from the phonebook. ''Playboy'' misspelled it ''Von Teese'', a name which she then kept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/von-143092-teese-burlesque.html|title=Dita Von Teese: Call her old-fashioned|last=Nguyen|first=Katherine|work=The Orange County Register|publisher=Orange County Register Communications|date=April 5, 2006|accessdate=September 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of her love of Gaultier, Von Teese has said, "Jean Paul Gaultier, John Galliano, and Vivienne Westwood were the first designers that really made an impact on me. Jean Paul has a lot of the same obsessions that I do, like corsetry, ballet-peach satin and silks, black silk velvet, bullet bras and girdles. When I was a teenager, I would look for 1930s peach satin lingerie pieces to try to get his look for less, because there was no way I could afford his things back then. It was a dream come true to meet him and become friends with him. I met him the first time when I was doing my first fashion pictorial, which was for Flaunt magazine, and it was a huge story of me wearing the most important pieces from his haute couture archives, and that was a dream!" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realstylenetwork.com/Magazine/Winter2013/#/28/ Real Style Magazine – Winter 2013].

Manson proposed on March 22, 2004, and gave her a 1930s, {{convert|7|carat|g|adj=on}}, European round-cut diamond engagement ring. On November 28, 2005, they were married in a private, non-denominational ceremony at home. A larger ceremony was held on December 3 at [[Castle Gurteen de la Poer]] in [[Kilsheelan]] ([[County Tipperary]]), Ireland, the home of their friend, [[Gottfried Helnwein]]. The wedding was officiated by surrealist film director and comic book writer [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]. It was attended by actor [[Eric Szmanda]], [[Lisa Marie Presley]], burlesque star [[Catherine D'lish|Catherine D'Lish]], artist [[Jessicka]], designer [[Betony Vernon]], producer [[Christian Hejnal]], and Manson's bandmate [[Madonna Wayne Gacy]].

In an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Von Teese stated, "I wasn't supportive of his partying or his relationship with another girl. As much as I loved him, I wasn't going to be part of that." Von Teese also stated that she gave Manson an ultimatum, and said that "it didn't work. Instead, it made me the enemy."&lt;ref name=EducaDita/&gt; Von Teese did not seek spousal support and expressed no interest in his assets.&lt;ref name=bbcdivorce/&gt; The news broke for the public and for Manson on his birthday on January 5, 2007, when he [[Service of process|was served]] the divorce papers.

In [[filmmaking]] and [[video production]], '''footage''' is raw, unedited material as originally filmed by a [[movie camera]] or recorded by a [[video camera]], which typically must be [[film editing|edited]] to create a motion picture, [[video clip]], [[television show]] or similar completed work.

Footage may also refer to sequences used in film and [[video editing]], such as special effects and [[archive]] material (for special cases of this, see [[stock footage]] and [[B roll]]). 

Since the term originates in film, footage is only used for recorded images, such as [[film stock]], [[videotape]]s or [[digitizing|digitized]] clips – on [[live television]], the signals from video cameras are instead called ''sources''.

==History==
[[File:A Corner of the Assembling and Joining Room at the Philadelphia Studio of the Lubin Company.jpg|thumb|Assembling and Joining Room at the Lubin Company (1914)]]
The origin of the term "footage" is that early [[35 mm film|35 mm]] [[silent film]] has traditionally been measured in [[foot (length)|feet]] and [[frame (film)|frames]]; the fact that film was measured by length in [[cutting room floor|cutting rooms]], and that there are 16 frames ([[4-perf]] [[film format]]) in a foot of 35 mm film which roughly represented 1 second of screen time ([[frame rate]]) in some early silent films, made footage a natural unit of measure for film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FNE6AQAAMAAJ&amp;q=footage#v=snippet&amp;q=footage&amp;f=false|title=Transactions of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers|last=Engineers|first=Society of Motion Picture and Television|date=1917|publisher=Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term then became used figuratively to describe moving image material of any kind.

==Film footage==
Sometimes film projects will also sell or trade footage, usually [[second unit]] material not used in the final cut. For example, the end of the non-[[director's cut]] version of ''[[Blade Runner]]'' used landscape views that were originally shot for ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' before the script was modified after shooting had finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2015/12/watch-u-s-theatrical-ending-to-blade-runner-that-features-footage-from-stanley-kubricks-the-shining-97996/|title=Watch: U.S. Theatrical Ending To ‘Blade Runner’ That Features Footage From Stanley Kubrick’s ‘The Shining’ {{!}} IndieWire|last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|website=www.indiewire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/trivia IMDb's Trivia page for ''Blade Runner''] – Retrieved July 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television footage==
[[File:Videowisconsinstudio.jpg|thumb|Footage can be processed in a [[video editing]] room.]]
[[Television]] footage, especially news footage, is often traded between [[television network]]s, but good footage usually commands a high price. The actual sum depends on duration, age, size of intended audience, duration of licensing and other factors. 

===Amateur video footage===
[[Amateur video]] footage of current events can also often fetch a high price on the market – scenes shot inside the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] during the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] were reportedly sold for [[United States dollar|US$]]45,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/world/ny-bzvid304099352dec30,0,1206167.story News day.com - Amateur video playing greater role] – Retrieved July 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Footage brokers==
A footage broker is an [[agent (law)|agent]] who deals in footage by promoting it to footage purchasers or producers, while taking a profit in the sales transaction.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The '''Guru Dutt team''' is a group of people [[Guru Dutt]] created for some of his finest works. The death of Guru Dutt cut short more works. What the team created is considered to forever have left its mark on [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]] as well as [[world cinema]].

==About==
Some well-known movies the team created are ''[[Chaudhvin Ka Chand]]'', ''[[Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam]]'', ''[[Kaagaz Ke Phool]]'' and ''[[Pyaasa]]''. ''Pyaasa'' is ranked among the top 100 movies of all times by [[Time magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2005/02/12/all-time-100-movies/#pyaasa-1957 |title= All-TIME 100 Movies |author=[[Richard Corliss]] and [[Richard Schickel]] |publisher=Time Entertainment |accessdate=2 Nov 2011 |date=2005-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of their work found critical appreciation long after these movies were made. Movies such as ''Kaagaz Ke Phool'', which was a huge commercial failure of its days, found critical and commercial success when it was re-released in the 1980s in Europe. Guru Dutt has a huge fan-following in France, Germany and Japan, where his movie festivals are held occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asian Film Series No.9 GURU DUTT Retorospective|publisher=Japan Foundation Asia Center|date=2000–2001|url=http://www.jpf.go.jp/e/culture/new/old/0101/01_03.html|accessdate=2009-04-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620144748/http://www.jpf.go.jp/e/culture/new/old/0101/01_03.html|archivedate=2009-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post Guru Dutt's death==
The magic of the team dissipated after the death of [[Guru Dutt]] when he was 39 years old.

Post his death, only a few of the members were able to achieve the critical acclaim they did as a team. Partly the reason was Guru Dutt's eye for detail. ''Pyaasa'' and ''Kaagaz Ke Phool'' are an inspiration for directors even today. The exceptions were [[Dev Anand]], [[S.D. Burman]], [[Sahir Ludhianvi]], [[Hemant Kumar]] and [[Mohammad Rafi]] who were already established when [[Guru Dutt]] entered  film making. [[Waheeda Rehman]] may be debatable, however none of her future roles would give her same critical acclaim as under the team.  V.K.Murthy continued work with Promod Chakravarthy but his notable work was in [[Tamas (film)|Tamas]] (1987), directed by his erstwhile assistant [[Govind Nihalani]].

{{nihongo|'''Himeka Nakamoto'''|中元 日芽香|Nakamoto Himeka|born April 13, 1996}} is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[mental health counselor]] and former [[Japanese idol|idol]]. She was a first-generation member of the [[Japanese idol|idol group]] [[Nogizaka46]].

== Career ==
In 2006, Nakamoto enrolled in [[Actor’s School Hiroshima]] as part of the 16th batch, joining her sister Suzuka who enrolled in the previous batch of the same year. As students, they performed in a duet called Tween.&lt;ref name="tween" /&gt;{{Better source|date=September 2018}} She was also a member of the idol group SPL∞ASH, which was founded by the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.menscyzo.com/2011/08/post_2924.html|title=乃木坂46のメンバーに芸能関係者が多数加入！　秋元康のライバル発言の本気度は高い!? - メンズサイゾー|website=メンズサイゾー|language=ja-JP|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''I Do! I Do!''''' is a [[Musical theatre|musical]] with a book and lyrics by [[Tom Jones (writer)|Tom Jones]] and music by [[Harvey Schmidt]] which is based on the [[Jan de Hartog]] play ''[[The Fourposter]]''. The two-character story spans fifty years, from 1895 to 1945, as it focuses on the ups and downs experienced by Agnes and Michael throughout their marriage.  The set consists solely of their bedroom, dominated by the large fourposter bed in the center of the room.

==History==
[[File:Robert Preston Mary Martin Ido! Ido! 1966.jpg|thumb|Robert Preston and Mary Martin]]
For [[Theatre producer|producer]] [[David Merrick]], who initially presented the play on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], ''I Do! I Do!'' was an ideal investment in that it had neither expensive sets and costumes nor a large cast.  After four previews, the Broadway production, directed and [[choreographed]] by [[Gower Champion]], opened on December 5, 1966, at the [[46th Street Theatre]], and closed on June 15, 1968, after 560 performances. [[Mary Martin]] and [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]] comprised the original cast. [[Carol Lawrence]] and [[Gordon MacRae]] played matinees starting in October 1967&lt;ref&gt;Funke, Lewis. "New of the Rialto", ''The New York Times'', October 22, 1967, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and then replaced Martin and Preston in December 1967.&lt;ref name=barnes&gt;Barnes, Clive. "Theater: A Reappraisal", ''The New York Times'', November 28, 1967, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin and Preston starred in a national tour, originally scheduled to play 27 cities for one year, starting in March 1968 in Rochester, New York. However, in February 1969 Martin became ill and the remainder of the tour was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Ronald L.[https://books.google.com/books?id=HE1wn61VpMEC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;dq=%22Mary+Martin%22+%22I+Do!I+Do!%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mary%20Martin%22%20%22I%20Do!I%20Do!%22&amp;f=false "'I Do!I Do!'

A film adaptation, written by Champion and starring [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Dick Van Dyke]], was announced by [[United Artists]] in 1969 but, following the commercial failure of several movie musicals around this time, UA scrapped the film in the spring of 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Gilvey, John Anthony.[https://books.google.com/books?id=oinpybZNXXUC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=%22Julie+Andrews%22+%22I+Do!I+Do!%22+Van+OR+Dyke&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Julie%20Andrews%22%20%22I%20Do!I%20Do!%22%20Van%20OR%20Dyke&amp;f=false "A Most Peculiar Lady"]''Before the parade passes by:Gower Champion '' (2005), Macmillan, {{ISBN|0-312-33776-0}}, pp. 206-207&lt;/ref&gt; A television version with [[Lee Remick]] and [[Hal Linden]] was broadcast in 1982.

A 1996 [[Off-Broadway]] revival at the [[Lamb's Theatre]] was directed by [[Will Mackenzie]] and starred [[Karen Ziemba]] and [[David Garrison]].&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben.[http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?html_title=&amp;tols_title=I%20DO!%20I%20DO!%20(PLAY)&amp;pdate=19960329&amp;byline=By%20BEN%20BRANTLEY&amp;id=1077011430298 "Till Death Do Them Part, Again",] ''[[New York Times]]'' (March 29, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; It ran for 52 performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lortel.org/lla_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&amp;title=I%20Do!%20I%20Do! ''I Do! I Do!''] on the [[Internet Off-Broadway Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is a favorite production of [[Regional theatre in the United States|regional theatre]]s across the United States and Canada, because of the minimal cost of mounting it. A production at the Chanhassen Dinner Theatre in [[Chanhassen, Minnesota]] ran for more than 20 years with leads David Anders and Susan Goeppinger, who eventually married during their run. This set the American record for a play running with the original cast.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Patricia and Nelson, Margaret.[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20120173,00.html "6,500 'I Do's' Make for One Sturdy Marriage for Susan Goeppinger and Fellow Actor David Anders"] people.com, May 1, 1989, Vol. 31 No. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

'''Act One'''

A bedroom, complete with four-poster bed, chaise longue and easy chair. There are two dressing tables downstage on either side. Michael and Agnes sit at the tables, getting dressed for their wedding. They finish their makeup and don their wedding apparel. They move through the ceremony, complete with Agnes throwing the flowers and the two going out into the audience to shake hands and welcome guests. Finally, Michael carries Agnes back across the threshold and they fall into the bed ("Prologue").

Agnes' feet hurt. Michael removes her shoe and kisses her foot. Agnes protests; a little drunk, a little weepy and very nervous. Michael professes his belief that they were married in a former life, and his sweetness makes her cry. We get a glimpse of the Michael that we will soon get to know when he ruins her happy moment by pointing out to her that she should go ahead and cry, as her youth is over. They nervously and elaborately prepare for the wedding night. They climb clumsily into bed and pull the covers back to find, to their horror, a pillow embroidered with the words, "God Is Love." Michael awkwardly turns out the light. They say goodnight to each other, and Agnes admits that she's never seen a naked man ("Goodnight"). There is an uncomfortable silence. Finally, they kiss and embrace passionately.

A spotlight comes up on Michael, sitting on the lip of the stage. He stretches and smiles and tells the audience a surprising secret: contrary to conventional wisdom, he actually loves his wife ("I Love My Wife"). He wakes her and they dance together. He falls asleep, and she puts the "God Is Love" pillow under his head, tucks him in and kisses him. The music becomes soft and tender as Agnes straightens the room. She folds his clothes and puts them away, gets the robe that is hanging at her dressing area and slips into a new outfit. We see that she is very, very pregnant. She ruminates on impending motherhood ("Something Has Happened").

In the following blackout, we hear an old-fashioned, hand-rung bell as Michael calls for Agnes. He is in bed with a washcloth on his head as she enters – still hugely pregnant – pushing a bassinet. Michael is having sympathetic labor pains and is very needy and upset. He already feels displaced by the baby to come. Sitting on his lap, Agnes goes into labor. As Michael goes for the doctor, they promise to each other that they will never let anything happen to their relationship.

Lights come up on Michael pacing, worrying and praying that his wife and baby survive ("The Waiting Room"). All is well; Michael has a son. He tosses cigars into the audience. Agnes enters, pulling a clothesline strung with diapers and baby clothes. Michael now realizes that he has a family for whom he needs to provide ("Love Isn't Everything"). Agnes then has a girl. Now Michael knows that he really needs to make money. Despite the stress, love isn't everything... but makes it all worth it. The tension between Agnes and Michael starts to become palpable. Michael has become very self-involved and self-important about his work and success as a novelist. He treats her as a lowly domestic as he lectures the audience on writers and writing, themes and works. She interrupts him in the middle of his diatribe and calls his work dull. He corrects her grammar, criticizes her cooking and habitual lateness, insisting that she accompany him to literary parties at which she feels uncomfortable. She counters that she also has a list of irritating habits ("Nobody's Perfect").

They return from the party and argue bitterly. He admits to having an ongoing affair with a younger woman. He blames Agnes for driving him away. He also points out that everyone knows that men get better with age and women get worse ("A Well Known Fact"). Agnes exits in disgust, and Michael finishes the song, making a fast, showy exit, a matinee idol in all his glory. In response to Michael having criticized her shopping habits, Agnes starts parading the extravagant items on her dressing table. She fantasizes about what her life would be like if she were a saucy, single divorcee, partying the night away ("Flaming Agnes").

Michael reappears to finish their discussion. She tells him to get out; he refuses, since, he claims, it is his house and his mortgage. She resolves to leave, taking the checkbook with her. He begins throwing her things into a suitcase: her alarm clock, her nightgown, her cold cream and the "God Is Love" pillow. Their eyes are now wide open about each other... and it isn't pleasant ("The Honeymoon Is Over").

She stalks out, with her ermine thrown over her nightgown, and the Flaming Agnes hat set determinedly on her head. He waits for a moment, certain of her return. When she doesn't come back, he rushes after her. We hear a struggle and he reappears, dragging her into the room. They fight and he throws her on the bed. His anger dissipates. Looking at her pleadingly, he tells her of his loneliness and regret. Her eyes fill with tears and she acknowledges that no one is perfect ("Finale – Act I"). They lie together and embrace.

'''Act Two'''

Agnes and Michael are in bed, celebrating New Year's Eve. The "God Is Love" pillow is gone, as is the gaudy chandelier. Time has passed; their children are teenagers now, celebrating at New Year's Eve parties of their own. Agnes and Michael are getting older ("Where Are the Snows?"). Michael is angry that their son hasn't returned and goes downstairs to wait for him. He storms back into the room, having found bourbon in his son's room. They argue about parenting, and Michael takes a swig from the bottle, only to discover that their son has filled the bottle with the cod liver oil that his mother thought she was administering for three years. We hear that, offstage, Michael has confronted his son at the door with the razor strap, only to discover that his boy is a man, dressed in his father's tuxedo.

Michael and Agnes reflect on the dreams and regrets of their early married years. Agnes asks Michael if he is disappointed. He is not ("My Cup Runneth Over"). They fantasize about their children growing up and moving out. They make plans for their middle age and retirement: he'll finally finish his Collected Tolstoy; she'll cruise to Tahiti and learn to do the hootchi-koo; he'll play the saxophone, she the violin ("When the Kids Get Married").

Later, Michael is dressing with little success for his daughter's wedding. He is not pleased with his little girl's choice of husband ("The Father of the Bride"). Agnes enters, crying. The stained glass window appears again, and Michael and Agnes watch the ceremony. They wave to the departing couple and go home to face an empty nest.

Agnes faces her transition to middle age. She doesn't know what to be now that her children no longer need her as much ("What Is a Woman?"). Michael enters the scene with two packages, but Agnes announces that she's going away; she doesn't love Michael anymore. She feels that he neither understands nor appreciates her, and reveals her infatuation with a young poet. Michael confesses his love and concern for his wife. He shows her that he loves her, and she breaks down, laughing and crying at once. He gives her a charm bracelet with a charm for each of them, one for each of their children and room for lots of grandchildren. She feels much better. They dance together and multi-colored ribbons cascade from above ("Someone Needs Me").

The music changes, becomes softer and more carousel-like as, together, they pick up the boxes and papers. They begin to pack up the house ("Roll up the Ribbons"). The music continues as they go to their dressing tables and apply old-age makeup, wigs and whiten their hair. It's eight a.m., and the much older Michael and Agnes are moving to a smaller apartment. They are gathering the last bits and pieces to take along with the movers. He pulls out a steamer trunk and finds the "God Is Love" pillow. Agnes wants to leave the pillow for the newlyweds who have bought the house, but Michael refuses. He was mortified to find it on their wedding night and won't have another young groom traumatized. Agnes sends Michael to look for a bottle of champagne and sneaks the pillow back under the covers. Michael returns with the champagne, but they determine that they won't drink it, since it's too early. They look at each other across the bed and remember what a good life they've had ("This House – Finale").

They take a last look around and leave the room together. Michael comes back in for the champagne and finds the "God Is Love" pillow under the covers. He puts it on Agnes' side of the bed and the champagne on his side before exiting. The curtain falls on the home.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtishows.com/i-do-i-do&lt;/ref&gt;

The original cast album was released over [[RCA Victor]]. [[Ed Ames]] had a major hit with his recording of the song "My Cup Runneth Over."

==Response==
In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Walter Kerr]] wrote that the stars were "great." Martin has "several funny little vocal tricks...and always...with that mellow sound that comes from her throat like red wine at room temperature." Preston is "at his untouchable best when the show asks him to be pompous, and blissfully obtuse."  The work of the director is noted:  "Then, courtesy of Gower Champion, there are all those engaging things the two do together...one of them is literally the soft-shoe to end all soft-shoes, because it is done with no shoes at all."  Kerr further wrote that the material was "on the whole barely passable, a sort of carefully condensed time capsule of all the cliches that have ever been spawned by people married and/or single...the lyrics are for the most part remarkably plain-spoken."&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Walter. "Theater: Musical 'I Do! I Do!' Arrives", ''New York Times'', December 6, 1966, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing the new cast of Carol Lawrence and Gordon MacRae, [[Clive Barnes]] wrote in ''The New York Times'' that they "exerted a certain charm." The musical is "very slight indeed&amp;nbsp;... Carol Lawrence was more than [Martin's] equal. She did the younger scenes with less cuteness and her acting had a depth unusual in a musical. Mr. MacRae...has a better if more conventional voice."&lt;ref name=barnes/&gt;

'''Jam!''' was a Canadian website which covers entertainment news. It was part of the [[Canoe.com]] online portal, formerly owned and operated by [[Quebecor]] through its [[Sun Media]] division, and now owned by [[Postmedia Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quebecor.com/en/comm/sale-sun-media-corporation%E2%80%99s-english-language-operations-postmedia-closes|title=Sale of Sun Media Corporation’s English-language Operations to Postmedia Closes|author=|date=13 April 2015|website=quebecor.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jam! was the only media outlet that published a comprehensive collection of the official Canadian record charts as compiled by [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] SoundScan and [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]].

[[CKXT-TV]], Sun Media's television station in [[Toronto]], aired a nightly entertainment magazine series, ''Inside Jam!''.  However, due to low ratings the program's airtime was reduced substantially.  Effective March 24, 2006, the show went from a daily program to a weekend only show,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Zerbisias |first=Antonia |title=Sun down |url=http://thestar.blogs.com/azerb/2006/03/more_blood_on_t.html |format=Blog |publisher=''Toronto Star'' |date=2006-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5oENJU5Ol?url=http://thestar.blogs.com/azerb/2006/03/more_blood_on_t.html |archivedate=2010-03-14 |accessdate=2010-03-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; before later being removed from the schedule altogether.  One of the hosts of the show, [[Chris Van Vliet]], announced on the programme in February 2010 that he would be leaving the show to join the [[CBS]] affiliate in [[Cleveland]] as their entertainment reporter.  His co-host [[Tara Slone]] re-located in August 2010 to [[Calgary]] to become co-host of [[Breakfast Television]] on [[CKAL-TV|CityTV Calgary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btcalgary.ca/inside/|title=Show Notes - Show Notes - Breakfast Television Calgary|author=|date=|website=Breakfast Television Calgary|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joe Bowman''', born '''Joseph Lee Bowman''' (April 12, 1925 – June 29, 2009), was a [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] [[shoemaking|bootmaker]] and [[marksman]] called "The Straight Shooter", considered to have been a guardian of [[Texas]] and [[Western (genre)|western]] frontier culture. Shortly after his death, Bowman was inducted [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] into the Texas Heroes Hall of Honor at the [[Frontier Times Museum]] in [[Bandera, Texas|Bandera]].&lt;ref&gt;Genie Strickland, "Frontier Times Museum announces Texas Heroes Hall of Honor", ''Bandera Bulletin'', July 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

Bowman was born to parents Mark McKinley Bowman, Sr. and Margaret Clark Bowman, in [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]] in East [[Tennessee]]. He was reared in [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], in western [[North Carolina]], where he and his brother, Mark, Jr., watched [[Tom Mix]] and [[Gene Autry]] [[films]] as boys. When he was twelve in 1937, Bowman moved with his parents to Houston, where his father procured work as an [[auto mechanic]] and as a place of potential relief for young Mark’s [[asthma]]. Young Bowman learned to shoot flies off the garbage can with [[BB gun]]s.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;William Grimes, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/us/06bowman.html “Joe Bowman, Sharpshooter, Dies at 84“], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of fifteen, he began apprenticeships with Roy Smith Boots and Palace Boots in downtown Houston. He was an active member of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] during his formative years in Houston and attained their highest rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

In 1943, he graduated from [[Sam Houston Math, Science, and Technology Center|Sam Houston High School]] in Houston and was drafted into service during [[World War II]], during which he was severely injured by a [[land mine]] and blown against a tree while stringing telephone lines for the Allies down a steep hill during the German occupation of France. He received three [[Bronze star]]s and a [[Purple Heart]] for his service as a combat infantryman in a US Army communications squadron in [[France]] during World War II. After the war, Bowman returned to Houston, where he attended the [[University of Houston]] for two years&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; before he opened Bowman and DeGeorge Boot Shop in Rice Village. He toured alone as "The Straight Shooter."&lt;ref name=chron&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/deaths/6505718.html|title=Robert Stanton, "Death of Joe Bowman"|publisher=''[[Houston Chronicle]]''|accessdate=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western entertainer==

"The Straight Shooter" performed with [[pistol]] and [[rifle]] at gun shows and [[rodeo]]s throughout the [[United States]]. One celebrated act involved lighting two candles, one on each side of an ax blade, then firing a .22 caliber rifle at the leading edge of the ax blade. This would split the bullet and the two pieces of the bullet would extinguished the candle flames. He also routinely split playing cards in half with the same technique and had the accuracy to blast tiny saccharine tablets into powder, which were actually smaller than the .22 caliber bullet itself.  He also performed for [[King Hussein]] in [[Jordan (country)|Jordan]], the ruling family of [[Kuwait]] and [[Queen Beatrix]] of the [[Netherlands]]. Bowman was sought out by law enforcement agencies around the world to give specialized firearm instruction and taught police [[Special Weapons and Tactics]] (S.W.A.T.) teams and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (F.B.I.) teams the techniques of "instinct shooting". Based in Houston, site of the [[Johnson Space Center]], Bowman entertained American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts and he performed in the world famous [[Houston Astrodome]] many times.  He also gave sharpshooting exhibitions at such events as the  [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Bowman’s marksmanship drew the attention of [[Roy Rogers]], [[John Wayne]], [[Jock Mahoney]], [[James Garner]], [[James Drury]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], and [[Dan Pastorini]], former [[quarterback]] of the [[Houston Oilers]]. Drury, a Houston resident and co-star of [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]’s ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' western [[television series]] from 1962–1971, told ''[[The New York Times]]'', "I’ve seen fast, I’ve seen faster, I’ve seen fastest, and then I’ve seen Joe Bowman."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Bowman’s son, Mark Bowman, of [[Austin, Texas]] said in an interview with the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' that his father "loved an era of bygone days and lived by that code. We lost a part of Houston’s heritage and a great guardian of Texas culture and history."&lt;ref name=chron/&gt; Until the last days of his life, Bowman took part in shooting exhibitions. Pastorini called Bowman "probably one of the most unselfish men I’ve ever met. He had a heart of gold and whenever you needed him, he was always there. He always had time for kids and charities … to talk about his gunslinging and his adeptness at handling a weapon," Pastorini told ''The Chronicle''.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

In 1989, on the occasion of the death of his close friend, actor/stuntman [[Jock Mahoney]], Bowman issued a stirring tribute written by Mahoney entitled "Coming Home", preserved on Bowman's [[Internet]] site. Mahoney starred in the former [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] western ''[[Yancy Derringer]]''. The poem was read in 1990 in [[Studio City, California|Studio City]], [[California]], by Jock Mahoney's widow, Autumn, at a memorial tribute to Mahoney, who died at seventy of a [[stroke]] prompted by a road accident in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joebowman.com/mahoneytribute.html|title=Tribute to Jock Mahoney|publisher=joebowman.com|accessdate=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowman made two pairs of boots for [[Roy Rogers]], which are displayed in the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum in [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]], [[Missouri]]. In the early 1960s, Bowman ended his bootmaking business and concentrated on his western show in which he wore a ten-gallon hat, an embroidered shirt and leather boots. He was a consultant to actor [[Robert Duvall]] for his role as [[Augustus "Gus" McCrae]], patterned on the legendary Texas [[cattleman]] [[Oliver Loving]], in the screen adaptation of [[Larry McMurtry]]'s classic Western ''[[Lonesome Dove (TV miniseries)|Lonesome Dove]]''.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt; He taught Duvall how to use a Walker revolver, once a favorite of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;
He also took Duvall to Bowman's favorite boot shop (Wheeler Boot Company) in Houston and introduced him to bootmaker Dave Wheeler, where the iconic boots Duvall wore as Gus were crafted.

[[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] purchased several of Bowman's custom fast draw holsters and two sets of Bowman's custom retooled [[Ruger Blackhawk]] single-action revolvers, with extremely intricate engraving and the legendary "smooth" action on the trigger hammer, early in the 1960s.  There is film circulating of Bowman and Sammy Davis, Jr. practicing fast draw against each other on a film set in Nevada during the [[Rat Pack]] era of the late 1950s.  Bowman also designed and created several pivoting, reinforced competition Western fast draw holsters that created a paradigm shift in competition fast draw, resulting in faster competitive draw times in the late 1950s and early 1960s competitions.  Into his 80s, Bowman still designed boots, belts and holsters for his friends, leaving seven decades of artisan expertise and master craftsmanship as his legacy.

==Death and legacy==

Bowman died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in his sleep at a [[hotel]] in [[Junction, Texas|Junction]], the seat of [[Kimble County]] in central Texas, where he and his wife of seventeen years, Betty Reid-Bowman, had stopped for the evening while en route to their home in Houston following an exhibition trip to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Mrs. Bowman said that her husband had been in good health though he wore a [[pacemaker]]. He was "soft-spoken and he was a man’s man," his widow told ''The Chronicle''.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

In addition to his wife and son, Bowman was survived by a daughter, Jan Bowman of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], Texas; a daughter-in-law, Charlene  Bowman of [[Austin, Texas]] and his brother, Mark M. Bowman, Jr., of [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]]. Bowman's father, brother, and son have the same names. In 1954, Bowman married the former Betty Fruge', (a Houston model and local TV star of the 50's Houston television show "Fashions in Motion"), who despite the lack of background with weaponry but with Bowman's tutelage, became the U.S. &amp;  North American female fast-draw champion. She appeared as the episode subject in 1962 on CBS's former [[quiz show]], ''[[To Tell the Truth]]''.  The marriage ended in 1968 in [[divorce]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Bowman is interred at Forest Park Lawndale in Houston.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

In an interview in 1992 with the ''Houston Chronicle'', Bowman lamented the passing of television westerns and culture: "So much of what I do is for the adults, reminding them of their childhood. What I remember is the morality of the westerns and of the [[cowboy]]s. That’s all that westerns were: morality plays, where there was good and evil. Now look at the movies and on TV: good can be bad, there’s no distinct line. I don’t think kids learn from that."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

In 2006, the official State of Texas sculptor, Edd Hayes, did an extremely lifelike bronze of "Joe Bowman – The Straight Shooter" to commemorate his lifetime of achievement.  Bowman was appointed "Texas Ambassador of Goodwill" by 4 Texas governors.  He was also named international spokesman for Sturm, [[Ruger]], &amp; Co., Inc. and was asked by Bill Ruger, Sr. to star in a nationally televised safety message campaign for "old model" single action revolvers.  Sturm, [[Ruger]] &amp; Company, Incorporated recently introduced a limited edition "Joe Bowman – Straight Shooter" New Vaquero .45 Caliber revolver into their line of traditional single action revolvers.

United States Senator [[John Cornyn]] (R-Texas) wrote a stirring tribute to Bowman's life and legacy that was published on Sen. Cornyn's website on July 20, 2009.  Additionally, in July 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', and the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', among other respected newspapers around the country all wrote feature tributes on the extraordinary life of this decorated war hero, patriot, historian, celebrated marksman and Western artisan.

'''Joget''' ([[Jawi script|Jawi]]: '''جوڬيت''') is a traditional [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] [[dance]] that originated in [[Malacca]]. It was influenced by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] dance of [[Branyo]] which is believed to have been spread to Malacca during the [[spice trade]]. In Malacca, it is better known as ''Chakunchak''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dancemalaysia.com/Dance/Traditional/Folk_Dance/Joget/joget.htm|title=Joget|publisher=Dance Malaysia|accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dance is one of the most popular folk dances in [[Indonesia]] &amp; [[Malaysia]] and normally performed by couples in cultural festivals, weddings and other social functions. Joget also grew in popularity within the Malay community in Singapore after its introduction in 1942.

The dance is of the Portuguese roots and is accompanied by an ensemble consisting of; a [[violin]] of [[Western world]], a knobbed [[gong]] of [[Asia]], a ''[[flute]]'' (optional) and at least two ''[[rebana]]'' or ''[[gendang]]'' of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. The tempo of Joget music is fairly quick with the feeling of teasing and playing between the partners. The music emphasizes duple- and triple-beat division, both in alternation and simultaneously, and sung in the northeast Malaysia style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Garland Handbook of Southeast Asian Music|page=243|author=Terry Miller &amp;  Sean Williams|isbn=978-0-415-96075-5|year= 2008|publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicmall-asia.com/malaysia/syncretic/joget.html|title=Syncretic Dance Form: Joget|publisher=Musicmall Production Pte Ltd|year=2004|accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the most popular type of Joget is called "Joget Lambak" and usually performed by a large crowd together in social functions.
In Indonesia, the term 'joget' is usually applied to any form of popular street dance, such as that to [[dangdut]] music.
[http://www.joget.org Joget], an open source workflow software built in Malaysia, is named after this dance.

{{nihongo|'''Kobe Animal Kingdom'''|神戸どうぶつ王国|Kōbe Dōbutsu Ōkoku}} is an animal and flower park located on [[Port Island]] in [[Kobe]], Japan. It is mainly located in and around a [[greenhouse]].

'''Le Marais''' ("The Marsh", {{IPA-fr|maʁɛ}}) is a historic district in [[Paris]], France. Long the aristocratic district of Paris, it hosts many outstanding buildings of historic and architectural importance. It spreads across parts of the [[3rd arrondissement of Paris|3rd]] and [[4th arrondissement of Paris|4th]] [[Arrondissements of Paris|arrondissement]]s in Paris (on the [[Rive Droite]], or Right Bank, of the [[Seine]]). Le Marais is today the trendiest shopping district in Paris with the top stores in Rue des Francs-Bourgeois and Rue des Rosiers. The most famous stores are BHV Marais, Merci: and Uniqlo Le Marais. &lt;ref name=ParisDigest&gt;{{Cite web | url= https://www.parisdigest.com/paris/le-marais.htm|title=Le Marais in Paris|author= | year=2018 |publisher=Paris Digest |accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Paris aristocratic district===
In 1240, the [[Order of the Temple]] built its fortified church just outside the walls of Paris, in the northern part of the Marais. The [[Temple (Paris)|Temple]] turned this district into an attractive area, which became known as the Temple Quarter, and many religious institutions were built nearby: the des Blancs-Manteaux, de Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie and des Carmes-Billettes [[convent]]s, as well as the church of Sainte-Catherine-du-Val-des-Écoliers.

During the mid-13th century, [[Charles I of Anjou]], King of Naples and Sicily, and brother of King [[Louis IX of France]] built his residence near the current n°7 rue de Sévigné.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;This hôtel remained until 1868, and the rue du Roi-de-Sicile is named after it.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1361 the King [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] built a mansion known as the [[Hôtel Saint-Pol]] in which the [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]] settled during his reign as well as his son's.

From that time to the 17th century and especially after the Royal Square (''Place Royale'', current ''[[place des Vosges]]'') was designed under King [[Henri IV of France]] in 1605, the Marais was the French nobility's favorite place of residence. French nobles built their urban mansions there—[[hôtels particuliers]], in French—such as the [[Hôtel de Sens]], the [[Hôtel de Sully]], the [[Hôtel de Beauvais]], the [[Hôtel Carnavalet]], the [[Hôtel de Guénégaud]] and the [[Hôtel de Soubise]], as well as many other [[hôtels particuliers]], found all over the district.

During the late 18th century, the district was no longer the ''most'' fashionable district for the nobility, yet it still kept its reputation of being an aristocratic area. By that time, only minor nobles and a few more powerful nobles, such as the [[Prince of Soubise|Prince de Soubise]], lived there. The [[Place des Vosges]] remained a place for nobles to meet. The district fell into despair after the [[French Revolution]], and was therefore abandoned by the nobility completely, and would remain so until the present day.

===Jewish community===

====People====
After the French Revolution, the district was no more the aristocratic district it once was during the 17th and 18th centuries. Because of this, the district became a popular and active commercial area, hosting one of Paris' main Jewish communities.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} At the end of the 19th century and during the first half of the 20th,{{ambiguous|date=November 2015}} the district around the [[rue des Rosiers]], referred to as the "[[Pletzl]]", welcomed many Eastern European Jews ([[Ashkenazi]]) who reinforced the district's clothing specialization.{{clarify|date=November 2015}}{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} During World War II the Jewish community was targeted by the [[Nazis]] who were occupying France.{{clarify|date=November 2015}}{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} As of today the rue des Rosiers remains a major centre of the Paris Jewish community, which has made a comeback since the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Public notices announce Jewish events, bookshops specialize in Jewish books, and numerous restaurants and other outlets sell [[kosher]] food.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

====Institutions====
The [[Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue|synagogue]] on 10 rue Pavée is adjacent to the rue des Rosiers.&lt;ref&gt;JARRASSE Dominique, Guide du patrimoine juif parisien, éditions Parigramme, 2003, p. 121-125.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} It was designed in 1913 by Art Nouveau architect [[Hector Guimard]], who designed several [[Paris Metro]] stations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Le Marais houses the [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme|Museum of Jewish Art and History]], the largest French museum of Jewish art and history. The museum conveys the rich history and culture of Jews in Europe and North Africa from the Middle Ages to the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Godet, Jean-Christophe (2011). "Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme," ''TimeOut Paris'' (online, September 13), see [http://www.timeout.com/paris/en/museums/musee-dart-et-dhistoire-du-judaisme], accessed 15 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mahj.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historic events====

In 1982, Palestinan terrorists murdered 6 people and injured 22 at a Jewish restaurant in Le Marais, [[Goldenberg restaurant attack|Chez Jo Goldenberg]], an attack which evidence ties to the [[Abu Nidal Organization]].&lt;ref name="Samuel"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Samuel | first1=Henry | title=Suspected mastermind of 1982 Paris Jewish restaurant attack 'bailed in Jordan' | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11681450/Suspected-mastermind-of-1982-Paris-Jewish-restaurant-attack-held-in-Jordan.html | accessdate=15 November 2015 | journal=The Telegraph ''(online, June 17)'' | year =2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Massoulié"&gt;{{cite book | author=Massoulié, François | year=1999 | title=Middle East Conflicts | series = Interlink Illustrated Histories | page=98 | location = Northampton, MA, USA | publisher=Interlink Books | isbn=1566562376 | url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=E7AqAAAAYAAJ | access-date = 15 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Harrison, Michael M. | year=1994 | chapter = France and International Terrorism: Problem and Response | title=The Deadly Sin of Terrorism: Its Effect on Democracy and Civil Liberty in Six Countries | series = Contributions in Political Science, No. 340 (Johnpoll, B.K., ser. ed.) |  editor = Charters, David | location = Westport, CT, USA | publisher = ABC-CLIO/Greenwood |  page=108 | isbn=0313289646 | url =  https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0313289646 | access-date = 15 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war rehabilitation===
By the 1950s, the district had become a working-class area and most of its architectural masterpieces were in a bad state of repair. In 1964, General de Gaulle's Culture Minister [[Andre Malraux]] made the Marais the first ''secteur sauvegardé'' (literally ''safeguarded sector''). These were meant to protect and conserve places of special cultural significance. In the following decades the government and the Parisian municipality led an active restoration and [[Rehabilitation Policy]].

The main [[Hôtels particuliers]] have been restored and turned into museums: the [[Hotel Sale|Hôtel Salé]] hosts the Picasso Museum, the [[Hôtel Carnavalet]] hosts the Paris Historical Museum, the Hôtel Donon hosts the [[Musée Cognacq-Jay|Cognacq-Jay Museum]], the H[[Hôtel Carnavalet|ô]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;tel de Saint-Aignan hosts the [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme]]. The site of Beaubourg, the western part of Marais, was chosen for the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], France's national Museum of Modern Art and one of the world's most important cultural institutions. The building was completed in 1977 with revolutionary architecture by [[Renzo Piano]] and [[Richard Rogers]].

===Today's Marais===
The Marais is now one of Paris' main localities for art galleries. Following its rehabilitation, the Marais has become a fashionable district, home to many trendy restaurants, fashion houses, and hip galleries.

The Marais is also known for the Chinese community it hosts. The community began to appear during [[World War I]]. At that time, France needed workers to replace its at-war soldiers and China decided to send a few thousand of its citizens on the condition that they would not take part in the war. After the 1918 victory, some of them decided to stay in Paris, specifically living around the current rue au Maire. Today, most work in jewellery and leather-related products. The Marais' Chinese community has settled in the north of the district, particularly in the surrounding of [[Place de la République]]. Next to it, on the Rue du Temple, is the Chinese Church of Paris.

Other features of the neighbourhood include the [[Musée Picasso]], the house of [[Nicolas Flamel]], the [[Musée Cognacq-Jay]], and the [[Musée Carnavalet]].

==LGBT culture==
Le Marais became a centre of [[LGBT]] culture, beginning in the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} As of today,{{when|date=November 2015}} 40% of the LGBT businesses in Paris are in Le Marais.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Florence Tamagne, author of ''Paris: 'Resting on its Laurels'?'', wrote that Le Marais "is less a 'village' where one lives and works than an entrance to a pleasure area" and that this differentiates it from Anglo-American [[gay villages]].&lt;ref name=Tamagnep250&gt;Tamagne, Florence (2014). "Paris: 'Resting on its Laurels'?" (Chapter 12). In: Evans, Jennifer V. and Matt Cook. ''Queer Cities, Queer Cultures: Europe since 1945,'' pp. 240, 250, London, ENG: [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], {{ISBN|144114840X}}, 9781441148407, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=r6zDAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA240 240] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=r6zDAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA250 ], accessed 15 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Tamagne added that like U.S. gay villages, Le Marais has "an emphasis on 'commercialism, gay pride and coming-out of the closet'".&lt;ref name=Tamagnep250/&gt;''Le Dépôt'', one of the largest cruising bars in Europe as of 2014 (per Tamagne), is in the Le Marais area.&lt;ref name=Tamagnep250/&gt;

'''"Lesbian Request Denied"''' is the third episode of the first season of American comedy-drama series ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'' (''OITNB''), based on [[Piper Kerman]]'s memoir, ''[[Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison]]'' (2010), regarding her time at [[FCI Danbury]], a minimum-security [[federal prison]]. It was written by [[Sian Heder]], and is one of two ''OITNB'' episodes directed by actress and director [[Jodie Foster]].&lt;ref name="FosterReteamswithOITNB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitney|first1=Erin|title='Orange Is The New Black' And Jodie Foster Have Teamed Up Again|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/07/orange-is-the-new-black-jodie-foster-returns_n_4745011.html|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was originally released, simultaneously with twelve other episodes making up the first season, on American streaming service [[Netflix]] on July 11, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/netflix-orange-new-black-premiere-date-jenji-kohan-448610 |title=Netflix Sets Premiere Date for Jenji Kohan's 'Orange Is the New Black'|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=April 30, 2013 |accessdate = June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode focuses on Sophia Burset (portrayed by [[Laverne Cox]]), a [[transgender]] inmate at the fictional prison Litchfield Penitentiary. In flashbacks, Sophia's family adjusts to her transition, while Sophia is arrested for committing [[credit card fraud]] to pay for her [[sex reassignment surgery]]. In present day, Sophia fights back against the prison reducing her dosage of exogenous [[estrogen]] due to budget cuts. In a subplot, new inmate [[Piper Chapman]], played by [[Taylor Schilling]], deals with the romantic overtures of a mentally unstable inmate, [[Crazy Eyes (character)|Suzanne "Crazy Eyes" Warren]], portrayed by [[Uzo Aduba]].

"Lesbian Request Denied" received widespread critical acclaim from critics, who praised the episode for the performances of Cox and Aduba, and for its respectful and nuanced treatment of a transgender character, especially in comparison to television's treatment of the transgender community in the past. For the episode, Aduba and Cox both received nominations for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series]], the former winning the award, while Foster was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series]].&lt;ref name="Emmy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/orange-new-black |title=Orange Is The New Black |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences|Television Academy]] |accessdate=June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox was the first (and to date, only) transgender actor to be nominated for an acting award at the Emmys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whipp|first1=Glenn|title=Emmys 2014: Transgender actress Laverne Cox makes Emmy history|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/tv/la-et-st-emmys-laverne-cox-trans-orange-is-the-new-black-20140710-story.html|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In flashbacks, Sophia Burset ([[Laverne Cox]]), formerly Marcus ([[M Lamar]]), a firefighter, pays for her sexual reassignment surgery by stealing credit card information from fire-wrecked houses. Sophia's wife, Crystal ([[Tanya Wright]]), while unaware of Sophia's crimes, fully supports her transition, although she requests that Sophia keep her penis so that they can continue to have sex. Sophia's son, Michael (Michael Rainey Jr.), however, is upset by her transition, and, upon discovering her credit card fraud, reports her crime to the police, causing her to be arrested.

In the present day, the prison switches Sophia to generic drugs and halves her dosages of estrogen in order to make up for budget cuts. After attempting to negotiate with prison counselor Healy ([[Michael J. Harney]]), she swallows the head of a [[bobblehead]] dog in order to see a doctor about her hormone therapy. However, the doctor decides to take Sophia off of hormones altogether, fearing that they are affecting her negatively. After fending off the proposition of prison guard Mendez ([[Pablo Schreiber]]) of hormones in exchange for oral sex, Sophia asks Crystal to smuggle in hormones for her; Crystal is disgusted with Sophia, telling her to "man up" for the sake of her wife and her son.&lt;ref name="Paste Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amatangelo|first1=Amy|title=Orange is the New Black Review: "Lesbian Request Denied" (Episode 1.03)|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2013/08/orange-is-the-new-black-review-lesbian-request-den.html|website=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|accessdate=June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, mentally unstable inmate [[Crazy Eyes (character)|Suzanne]] ([[Uzo Aduba]]), called "Crazy Eyes", begins stalking [[Piper Chapman|Piper]] ([[Taylor Schilling]]). Piper is perturbed by the attention, despite using Suzanne to ward off her ex-girlfriend [[Alex Vause|Alex]] ([[Laura Prepon]]). Piper decides to let Suzanne down easy by informing her about her fiancé. When Piper confronts Alex for "stealing her good life" by naming her in trial, Alex insists that she had no part in her being in prison.&lt;ref name="Paste Magazine"/&gt; Piper decides to ensure this by asking her fiancé, Larry ([[Jason Biggs]]), who is dealing with his sexual abstention in Piper's absence, to find out whether Alex named her.

Miss Claudette ([[Michelle Hurst]]) receives a new roommate, Janae ([[Vicky Jeudy]]), who disrespects her expectations for cleanliness and privacy. Miss Claudette uses her power at the prison to remove Janae from her bunk, resulting in Piper moving into the bunk. Miss Claudette's code of conduct is violated when Suzanne vengefully pees next to Piper's bed.

==Production==
Explaining how she got involved in the production, [[Jodie Foster]] said, "I read the book [''[[Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison]]''] and I said to my agent, 'Oh man, I really want to do this.' He was like, 'Well, [the showrunner is] Jenji Kohan!' And I was like, 'Would you please pass along that I'd like to be a part of this?' Then eventually I found out a friend of mine was doing prep work for the show, and I told her, 'Please tell the writer [Piper Kerman] I love that book and I'm dying to do something.' Then that's what happened. They don't tell you what episode you're shooting so it's a wonderful exercise and meditation in letting go because you have no idea what you're doing. One episode takes eight days to prep and eight to shoot. It's a fast deal. And I'd never done TV before."&lt;ref name="JodieFosteronOITNB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunt|first1=Stacey|title=Emmys: Jodie Foster on Why She Wanted to Direct 'Orange Is the New Black' (Q&amp;A)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jodie-foster-why-she-wanted-709132|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Series creator and showrunner [[Jenji Kohan]] stated that Foster directed the episode as "sort of her dry-run for when she does her television thing", referencing an as-of-yet unrealized project for [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] Foster was to spearhead. When asked about Foster's merits as a TV director, Kohan said, "Movie directing is different from TV directing and I think some things were like a culture shock for her because, in way, you know the director's not the king in TV. It's more collaborative with the writers than she's used to...That said? She was incredibly collaborative and really game and came in saying, 'I haven't done this before. It's a learning curve.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fienberg|first1=Daniel|title=Interview: 'Orange Is The New Black' creator Jenji Kohan talks prison, Netflix and Jodie Foster|url=http://www.hitfix.com/the-fien-print/interview-orange-is-the-new-black-creator-jenji-kohan-talks-prison-netflix-and-jodie-foster|website=[[HitFix]]|accessdate=June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox initially wanted to play Sophia pre-transition as well, but was dissuaded by Foster, explaining, “I was like, ‘I have to butch it up,’ because I don’t think Jodie believed that I could pull this off. I go to Jodie and she looks at me and she’s like, ‘We’re gonna have to hire someone.’ Jodie Foster didn’t think I looked masculine enough to play a guy.” Cox said that several "really butch black men" auditioned for the part before “our casting director found out that I have a twin brother [M Lamar]...He auditioned, and he got the part.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buxton|first1=Ryan|title='Orange Is The New Black' Star Laverne Cox's Twin Brother Plays Her Pre-Transition Counterpart (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/26/orange-is-the-new-black-laverne-cox_n_3660712.html|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking about the scene in which Sophia's wife, Crystal, gives her advice on clothing, Foster said, "That was the toughest day of the shoot. It was like, 'How am I going to accomplish this?' I love to shoot fast because I prep like an insane person. But that scene was so incredibly long. It's two people talking. And in order to work with [looking in the] mirror and the kissing -- all those different beats were extremely challenging. It was the hardest day for acting by far. I loved their performances and the subtlety of the things that aren't said. Laverne really brought it home. I'm so proud!"&lt;ref name="JodieFosteronOITNB"/&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
"Lesbian Request Denied" received critical acclaim. Myles McNutt, reviewing the episode for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', awarded the episode an "A", the highest grade on the site, calling it "a brilliant example of how the series’ flashbacks can transform our understanding of these characters". McNutt noted that "On a lesser show, Sophia’s role as “The transsexual to whom Piper sold her hair for a weave” would have remained “The transsexual to whom Piper sold her hair for a weave,” but here the character is elevated above Piper for a week as we learn Sophia’s own story of becoming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNutt|first1=Miles|title=Orange Is The New Black: "Lesbian Request Denied"/"Imaginary Enemies"|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/orange-is-the-new-black-orange-is-the-new-black-100206|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|accessdate=June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amy Amatangelo of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' rated the episode 8.9 out of 10, repeating McNutt's point that "on the surface, we've all seen a TV character like Sophia before (probably on a crime drama sassing a detective), but ''Orange'' delved deep to show us a complicated and fascinating woman". Amatangelo also praised the scenes between Piper and Suzanne, as "they effortlessly flowed between comic relief and terror."&lt;ref name="Paste Magazine"/&gt;

Danielle Henderson of ''[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture]]'' gave the episode four out of five stars, stating that she was "ready to base [her] whole view of the show on how [Sophia] was treated, knowing that few people writing for television know what to do with (a) women, (b) black women and certainly not (c) black transgender women"; she called Sophia's backstory "heartbreaking". Henderson also praised the characters of Ms. Claudette and [[Nicky Nichols|Nicky]], calling them "fun" and "scene-stealing", respectively, while criticizing Piper and Larry for "living in the no longer useful framework of... Waspy obliviousness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henderson|first1=Danielle|title=Orange Is the New Black Episode Three Recap: My Good Life|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/07/orange-is-the-new-black-recap-season-1-lesbian-request-denied-sophia.html|website=[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture]]|accessdate=June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Madness''''' is a 2010 [[horror film]] written and directed by Sonny Laguna, David Liljeblad and Tommy Wiklund. It is a horror film that follows two young teenagers as they hitchhike with some boys, but get captured by a crazy family of Swedes. The film is rated R for violence, nudity, gore and profanity. 

== Plot ==

In the wilderness near [[Minneapolis]], a bound and battered pregnant woman is stabbed and stomped to death by a [[hillbilly]] named Drake, who drags her body away.

It is revealed to be 1994, and cheerleaders Tara and Jenna are on their way to a competition being held in Minneapolis. Low on gas, the two pull into a service station, where they meet Chad and Oliver, who are experiencing car trouble. Taking pity on the two men, the girls offer them a ride, and the quartet leave, not realizing they were being watched by a one-eyed, Swedish-speaking man, who uses a [[walkie-talkie]] to report what he has seen to his comrades. One-eye follows the group, and causes them to crash by a throwing a piece of roadkill onto their windshield.

Drake pulls up to the walking quartet, and offers them a ride. Once everyone is in the car, Drake drives into the forest, prompting a panicked Chad to jump out of the moving vehicle. Drake meets up with One-eye, and the two tie Tara, Jenna, and Oliver up at gunpoint, and take them to their hideout. Drake places Tara and Jenna in the main house, while One-eye rapes Oliver in a shed. Elsewhere, Chad encounters Bob, one of the hillbillies, and the two fight. Chad kills Bob with a switchblade, and follows a pillar of smoke to the [[rednecks]]' house.

When One-eye leaves, Oliver uses a saw to mutilate his own hand in order to escape his handcuffs and runs into the woods, where he is killed by Drake. Back in the house, Tara and Jenna free themselves, and sneak outside, only to be confronted by Drake. The two are saved by Chad, who stabs Drake in the neck. The trio reach a rowboat and try to escape with it, but are recaptured by One-eye. One-eye takes Chad and Tara back to the house, and forces them listen over a walkie talkie as Drake drowns Jenna.

Afterward, Chad breaks the chair he is tied to, suffocates the elderly member of the hillbilly clan left to watch them, and frees Tara. As they stumble down the road, Chad and Tara are found by One-eye and Drake, and chased into the forest, where they become separated. Chad leads Drake and One-eye into an abandoned house, and while he manages to wound both of them, he is eventually overpowered. With Drake poised to kill Chad, Tara appears and shoots him with a gun she took off the dazed One-eye. The victory is short lived, as One-eye then attacks Tara. Chad saves Tara by luring One-eye into a room with loose floorboards, which One-eye falls through. Finding One-eye impaled by debris, Chad finishes him off with an axe.

In a [[post-credits scene]] set six months later, another Swedish survivalist [[Sniper|snipes]] a young girl and her mother at the gas station.

== Release ==

''Madness'' was released on DVD in the United States by Well Go in 2010. Despite the packaging proclaiming it to the "Unrated Version" this cut of the film is missing the scene in which Oliver is sodomized by One-eye.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.schnittberichte.com/report.php?ID=968337|title = ''Madness''|date = 3 November 2010|website = movie-censorship.com|accessdate = 28 December 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

HorrorNews.net found ''Madness'' awkward, unoriginal and inconsistent, but admitted there were enough good elements (such as the effects and finale) to warrant a viewing, and concluded its review by saying "there are certainly worse options out there to stomach".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://horrornews.net/29108/film-review-madness-2010/|title = Film Review: ''Madness'' (2010)|last = Rotten|first = Doc|date = 25 January 2011|website = horrornews.net|accessdate = 31 December 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt; The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre wrote that it was "a movie-long chase-and-fight scene between equally stupid victims and freaks, each of them inexplicably ignoring some obvious dangers, pausing at critical moments, and even stopping for a dramatic moment in the middle of a road while they are running for their lives. That said, the endless visceral energy and brutal escalating fights do make for some almost-good action and horror".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://thelastexit.net/cinema/violence.html#Madness|title = Extreme Sadism &amp; Violence|last = |first = |date = 10 November 2013|website = thelastexit.net|accessdate = 11 November 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt;{{SPS|date=January 2014}}

The talk show premiered on April 18, 2016&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.abs-cbn.com/tv/shows/magandangbuhay/videos/2016/04/15/2741516-magandang-buhay-starting-april-18-on-abs-cbn-umaganda Magandang Buhay: Starting April 18 on ABS-CBN Umaganda]&lt;/ref&gt; and airs every Weekday mornings from 8:00am to 9:30am, right after ''[[Umagang Kay Ganda]]'' and before ''Kapamilya Blockbusters'', and [[Encore|encore telecast]] on [[Jeepney TV]] every Weekday afternoons from 4:20pm to 5:15pm. It also airs worldwide via [[The Filipino Channel|TFC]].

The title of the show is inspired from the former popular line of the same name from the telenovela, ''[[Dream Dad]]''.

==History==
&lt;!-- Please stop added ''Anti-Anime'' Sentiments on this Magandang Buhay article --&gt;
From April 18, 2016 to June 17, 2016, ''Magandang Buhay'' debuted on its initial timeslot at 7:30am–9:00am, replacing ''[[Kris TV]]''. On June 21, 2016, ''Magandang Buhay'' permanently moved to a new timeslot at 8:00am–9:30am, due to the other morning show ''[[Umagang Kay Ganda]]'' expanding into 3 hours since June 20, 2016.

== Broadcast Variations ==
While the program continues to air before the ''Kapamilya Blockbusters'' movie block in Manila, ABS-CBN Regional TV stations that receive a local [[TV Patrol]] newscast at 5:00 pm carry the program in full as in Manila; the full-time practice, however, lessens the KB block by 30 to 45 minutes as the 9:30 am slot is used to air a ''Kapamilya Gold'' program that was pre-empted by the local newscast, followed by the Regional stations' return to network programming afterwards (despite running the movie block halfway in progress).&lt;ref&gt;[http://abscbnpr.com/magandang-buhay-gains-more-viewers-in-metro-manila/ “MAGANDANG BUHAY” GAINS MORE VIEWERS IN METRO MANILA]&lt;/ref&gt;

When carriage of the [[NBA Finals]] is done live on the main channel since 2016, the show is either reduced to 60 minutes or pre-empted altogether during an NBA Finals game day.

==Hosts==
* [[Karla Estrada]]
* [[Melai Cantiveros|Melai Cantiveros-Francisco]]
* [[Jolina Magdangal|Jolina Magdangal-Escueta]]

==In popular culture==
''Magandang Buhay'' created the term "''Momshie''" which was introduced as a term of endearment for the three hosts as well as mothers. It later became a common nickname that ends with the suffix '-shie', referring to children as ''Anakshies'', fathers as ''Popshies'', and more.

==Trivia==
Estrada, Cantiveros and Magdangal were previously guest co-hosts for the now-defunct talk show ''[[Kris TV]]'', hosted by [[Kris Aquino]]. The three hosts were also formerly contestants in the [[Your Face Sounds Familiar (Philippines season 1)|first season of ''Your Face Sounds Familiar'']] in 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9242">[[File:MebetoysInnocentiMiniSkis.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Mebetoys Innocenti Mini with opening hood and doors featured with skis and sled.]]
'''Mebetoys''' was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[toy]] manufacturer that produced [[die-cast toy|die-cast]] model cars during the 1960s and 1970s.  The company was purchased by [[Mattel]] in 1969. Mebetoy's main competition in Italy was the earlier trailblazer [[Mercury (toy manufacturer)| Mercury]], [[Politoys|Polistil]] and the rarer [[Ediltoys]]. 

==History==
The Gran Toros website says that Mebetoys was started by the Besana family in 1959 as a toy die casting company, in Oleggio Castello, Novara, Italy (80&amp;nbsp;km north of Milan). The name comes from '''ME'''ccanica '''BE'''sana '''TOYS'''.  A diecast car line was started in 1967 (Rixon 2005, p. 36), rather late compared to the entry of many other companies in the early-to-mid-1950s. In detail and proportion, Mebetoys joined superior model producers of French [[Solido]] and fellow Italian [[Polistil]], in many ways these became the triumvirate of diecast models on the European continent, though Danish [[Tekno]] and Italian [[Rio Models]] also were important. Models were exact to scale with many moving parts, and generally more sophisticated than venerable British producers [[Corgi Toys|Corgi]] and [[Dinky Toys]].

==Model Details==
Mebetoys models were known for well-done castings (Rixon 2005, p. 80). Some were very clever model selections such as the Autobianchi A66 Elaf petroleum with a roof luggage rack carrying two large plastic oil barrels, or the Porsche 912 Rally (a 911 in rally form) with rock guards in thin yellow plastic strips covering the front windshield and hood and also featuring red and chrome body and bumper supports which extended from front to rear bumper. This car, in 1:43 scale, was topped off, literally, with three spare tires on the roof. Mebetoys Innocenti Mini (Italian-made mini) appeared in several different guises - including with skis and sled on its roof rack. Other models were unique because they were not offered elsewhere, like the ISO Fidia S4 grand touring sedan. Politoys had the Rivolta and Corgi and Matchbox made the Grifo ubiquitous, but nobody else made the Fidia S4. Models such as the Lamborghini Urraco, Maserati Bora, Toyota 2000 GT, and Ferrari 365 GTC-4 were also special and not often seen in 1:43 scale. Corgi Toys made the Bora, but the Mebetoys version was much better proportioned, detailed and painted (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p. 74). 
[[File:MebetoysPorsche924Corner.jpg|thumb|left|275px|The front fender corner of the 1:24 scale Porsche 924. From a few inches distance, proportion and detail were well executed, but up close casting and flashing irregularities, presumably after tumbling the diecast pieces, were evident.]]
Sinclair's Auto Miniatures, largely responsible for bringing the diecast collector hobby to the United States, discussed that many people were not aware that Mebetoys also made a few promotional issue diecast cars (Sinclair's 1977; Levine 2009). In the 1960s the company issued a couple of 1:24 scale Alfa Romeos, referred to as the "le veterane" set. These two cars were a 1925 P2 World Champion Grand Prix car and a 1951 Alfetta racer. They had exquisite detail with rubber tires and were mounted on a wood base with a decorative identification plate and covered with a clear plastic display box. These were reissued in the late 1970s (Sinclair's 1977).

The original Mebetoys logo was an 'opening eye' that looks very similar to the American CBS TV logo. Packaging was often a wood grain beige style with a plastic window - always including the 'eye' logo. Some boxes were other colors like a bright yellow. Then Mattel took over and the Mattel red pointed circle was added alongside the Mebetoys logo.

==Changes by Mattel==
In 1969, Mebetoys was bought by [[Mattel]], which carried on Mebetoys models and began to market new 1/43 scale cars (Force 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;146–147). At first, these were the same realistic Mebetoys European models and had many opening features, rubber tires, and excellent detail.    
===Gran Toros and customs===

Incrementally, however, Mattel changed many aspects of Mebetoys. Hard plastic 'speed' tires replaced rubber and new California custom body designs were introduced in 1:43 scale and marketed as [[Hot Wheels]] Gran Toros, though they still said Mebetoys on the base. Thus the marque became less 'European' with more Mattel influence.  

In order to attract buyers in the U.S. market, models like the realistic Toyota 2000 GT were augmented with ones such as Tom Daniel's fantasy custom Twin Mill (a model still used in the standard Hot Wheels line). The [[Hot Wheels]] flames-off-the-wheel emblem was applied to some Mebetoys packaging. "Hot Wheels" was translated into Italian as "Sputafuoco", or literally, the cars that "spit fire". Thus Mebetoys were marketed as a sort of larger [[Hot Wheels]] range. In an interesting twist  Mattel's 'Flying Colors' normal sized smaller Hot Wheels were offered in Italy in Italian Mebetoys boxes in the late 1970s. The 1:43 scale line was discontinued entirely around 1983.

===Larger sizes===
[[File:MebetoysPorsche924.jpg|thumb|right|275px|A later well-proportioned and well-detailed Mebetoys Porsche 924 coupe in larger 1:24 scale.]]
Mebetoys under Mattel also made a 1:24 scale line which included a BMW 323 coupe, Porsche 924, Porsche 928, Ford Fiesta, Citroen Dyane (one with Zodiac style rubber boat!), Citroen Visa sedan, Alfa Romeo Alfetta (one in Cariabinieri livery), Alfa Alfasud Sprint, Alfa Giulietta sedan, FIAT Uno sedan, Volkswagen Beetle, Volkswagen Golf sedan, Talbot Horizon sedan / Simca 1308 sedan, Mercedes-Benz 450 SEL sedan, Opel Kadett, a Land Rover (one outfitted for desert photography), and a Lancia Beta coupe - one variation of which came handsomely equipped with bicycle rack and two bikes. These were well detailed, but for comparison of 'family' brands, the paint was done better on the later 1:24 scale Besana brothers Martoys. A few 1:30 scale trucks and vans were also made, like the FIAT 242 Attrez-Raid Rally Van. 

Why so many of the 1:24 scale vehicles were rather mundane sedans is an interesting question since manufacturers often make sportier cars for play. Whether any of these were used for promotional purposes is unknown. Some of the later cars (and some of the last made by Mebetoys) had rather fat plastic tires and unwieldy wheel designs. 

Some of the cars seemed spot on in detail and proportions like the Porsche 924 and the Volkswagens. Others were less confident in their realism. The Porsche 924 had nearly perfect proportion and the details were exquisite. The wheel design was generic but detailed and attractive with five larger and five smaller slots. Everything opened, including the rear plastic hatch. Even the hidden headlights popped up by moving a lever at the front of the chassis. When fully opened, however, the headlight lever stuck out from under the front bumper like some kind of strange antenna. The seats tilted forward, but chrome plating the steering wheel and gear shift was not so realistic. Another negative was that though the doors opened they did not include the door frame window surround.

==A Diecast Legacy==
From the Gran Toros website again, it states that the Mebetoys company was founded by Ugo and [[Martino Besana]] in 1959.  [[Mario Besana]] joined the company in 1967, one year after the company started producing cars. After selling the brand to [[Mattel]], the Besana brothers set up [[Martoys]]. This firm made car models in 1/24th scale for only two years, from 1974 to 1976.  Then possibly because of confusion with [[Louis Marx and Company]], the name was changed to [[Bburago]], with two 'Bs' (the first B stood for the creator's name, Besana, while the remainder was for the town of Burago di Molgora where the models were made).  Bburago became probably the most well-known and popular producer of 1:18 scale models through the 1980s and 1990s.  Bburago's assets were sold in 2006 to Maisto.

The '''Media and Entertainment International''' ('''MEI''') was a [[global union federation]] representing workers in the arts.

The federation was founded in 1993 with the merger of the [[International Secretariat of Arts, Communications, Media and Entertainment Trade Unions]] and the [[International Federation of Trade Unions of Audio-Visual Workers]].  Originally named the '''International Secretariat for Arts, Mass Media and Entertainment Trade Unions''' ('''ISAMMETU'''), in 1995 it renamed itself as the "Media and Entertainment International".&lt;ref name="docherty"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Docherty|first1=James C.|last2=van der Velden|first2=Sjaak|title=Historical Dictionary of Organized Labor|date=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0810879883|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federation campaigned in support of [[public service broadcasting]], and in support of minimum working conditions for freelance film and theatre workers.  The federation failed to agree a common policy on whether governments should mandate that a particular percentage of media should be produced locally.&lt;ref name="gordon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Michael E.|last2=Turner|first2=Lowell|title=Transnational Cooperation Among Labor Unions|date=2000|publisher=Cornell Press|isbn=0801437792|pages=174&amp;ndash;175, 296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 2000, the federation merged with the [[International Federation of Commercial, Clerical, Professional and Technical Employees]], [[International Graphical Federation]] and [[Communications International]], to form the [[Union Network International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQs|url=http://www.uniglobalunion.org/about-us/faqs|website=UNI Global Union|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its existence the federation was led by general secretary Jim Wilson.&lt;ref name="gordon" /&gt;

In [[cinematography]], '''night-for-night''' filming is the practice of actually filming night scenes at night.

In the early days of cinema, before the invention of the proper lighting systems, night scenes were filmed "[[day-for-night]]"--that is, they were filmed during the day, and the film was "corrected", either with a [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] lens on the [[movie camera]], or via a variety of [[post-production]] techniques. Day-for-night shooting is still used in low-budget films.

The American television producer [[Quinn Martin]] was known for heavily utilizing night-for-night filming.&lt;ref&gt;Etter, Jonathan.  ''Quinn Martin, Producer''.  Jefferson:  McFarland, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museum.tv/eotv/martinquinn.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{lang|la|XII Panegyrici Latini}}''''' or '''''Twelve Latin Panegyrics''''' is the conventional title of a  collection of twelve [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]]  and [[Late Antiquity|late antique]] prose [[panegyric]] orations written in Latin.
The authors of most of the speeches in the collection are anonymous, but appear to have been Gallic in origin. Aside from the first panegyric, composed by [[Pliny the Younger]] in {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;100, the other speeches in the collection date to between {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;289 and 389 and were probably composed in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]].&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 4"&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The original manuscript, discovered in 1433, has perished; only copies remain.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 3–4"&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Gaul had a long history as a center of rhetoric. It maintained its dominance of the field well into the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;T.J. Haarhoff, ''Schools of Gaul'' (London, 1920; rept. Johannesburg, 1958), ''passim'', cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; An early lead in the field was taken by the [[Aedui]], early allies of Rome and eager to assimilate to the ways of their new rulers: Maenian schools were celebrated as early as the reign of [[Tiberius]] ({{abbr|r.|Ruled}}&amp;nbsp;{{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;14–37).&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' 3.43, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; They continued to flourish into the days of Eumenius' grandfather, but were closed by the mid-3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;''Pan''. 9.17.2–3, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There was some revival in the city in the late 3rd century, but after the establishment of Trier as an imperial capital in the 280s, the orators began feeling jealousy for the imperial patronage enjoyed by the citizens of Trier.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 8"&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the political and economic hegemony of the city, however, Trier failed to make any significant mark on the rhetoric of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Haarhoff, ''Schools of Gaul'', 48, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Nixon and Rodgers suggest that it was simply too close to the imperial court.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 8"/&gt; 
The surviving evidence (which might be prejudiced by [[Ausonius]]' ''Professors of Bordeaux'') points to a shift from Autun and Trier as centers of the art in the Tetrarchic and Constantinian period, moving to Bordeaux later in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Haarhoff, ''Schools of Gaul'', 46–48, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 8; Nixon and Rodgers, 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The panegyrics evince a familiarity with prior handbooks of rhetoric. Some have argued that [[Menander of Laodicea]]'s treatises were particularly influential on the collection, and believed his precepts were used in the tenth panegyric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Mesk |title=Zur Technik der lateinischen Panegyriker |journal=[[Rheinisches Museum für Philologie]] |volume=67 |issue= |year=1912 |pages=569–590 [p. 573] |url=http://www.rhm.uni-koeln.de/067/Mesk.pdf }} Cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt; However, because so much of Menander's advice consisted of standard rhetorical procedure, the parallels adduced in favor of Menander as a model are insufficient to prove his direct use by the panegyrists. Other handbooks of rhetoric might also have had influence on the collection. [[Quintilian]]'s ''Institutio Oratoria'', for example, treats the subject of an oration's ancestry, parentage, and country in a manner similar to the panegyrics of 289, 291, 297, 310, 311, 321, and 389.&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian, ''Institutio Oratoria'' 3.7.10ff; Galletier I: xxxi, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In any case, the other panegyrics in the collection vary widely from Menander's schema.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Parallels with other Latin orators, like [[Cicero]] and [[Pliny the Younger]], are less frequent than they would have been if those authors had served as stylistic models.&lt;ref&gt;E. Vereecke, "Le Corpus des Panégyriques latins de l'époque tardive," ''Antiquité classique'' 44 (1975): 151–53, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language and style ==
The Latin of the panegyrics is that of a [[Classical Latin#Authors of the Golden Age|Golden Age]] Latin base, derived from an education heavy on Cicero, mixed with a large number of [[Classical Latin#Silver Age Latin|Silver Age]] usages and a small number of Late and [[Vulgar Latin|Vulgar]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; To students of Latin in Late Antiquity, Cicero and [[Virgil]] represented the paragons of the language; as such, the panegyrists made frequent use of them. Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' is the favorite source, the ''[[Georgics]]'' the second favorite, and the ''[[Eclogues]]'' a distant third.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 16. See also: Rees, "Praising in Prose: Vergil and the Panegyric," in ''Romane Memento: Vergil in the Fourth Century'' (London: Duckworth, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; (Other poets are much less popular: there are infrequent allusions to [[Horace]],&lt;ref&gt;As at 9.2.4, referencing ''Carmina'' 2.1.22, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and one complete borrowing from [[Ovid]].&lt;ref&gt;12.25.2–3, modeled on Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 15.746–61, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;) When drawing from Cicero's body of work, the panegyrists looked first to those works where he expressed admiration and contempt. As a source of praise, Cicero's panegyric of [[Pompey]] in support of the Manilian law (''[[De Imperio Cn. Pompei]]'') was quite popular. It is echoed thirty-six times in the collection, across nine or ten of the eleven late panegyrics. Cicero's three orations in honor of [[Julius Caesar]] were also useful. Of these, the panegyrists were especially fond of the ''[[Pro Marcello]]''; across eight panegyrics there are more than twelve allusions to the work. For vilification, the [[Catiline Orations|Catiline]] and [[In Verrem|Verine]] orations were the prominent sources (there are eleven citations to the former and eight to the latter work).&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other classic prose models had less influence on the panegyrics. Pliny's ''Panegyricus'' model is familiar to the authors of panegyrics 5, 6, 7,&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 18 n.68.&lt;/ref&gt; 11, and especially 10, in which there are several verbal likenesses. [[Sallust]]'s ''Bellum Catilinae'' is echoed in the panegyrics 10 and 12, and his ''Jugurthine War'' in 6, 5, and 12.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Livy seems to have been of some use in panegyric 12&lt;ref&gt;At 12.15.6, borrows its sentiments and phrasing to Livy 28.44.8, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and 8.&lt;ref&gt;At 8.16.4, which echoes Livy 38.17.3, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The panegyrist of 8 must have been familiar with [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto|Fronto]], whose praise of [[Marcus Aurelius]] he mentions,&lt;ref&gt;At 8.14.2, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and the panegyrist of 6 seems to have known [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]''.&lt;ref&gt;At 6.9.3, which echoes Tacitus ''Agricola'' 12; B. Baldwin, "Tacitus, the ''Panegyrici Latini'', and the ''Historia Augusta''," ''Eranos'' 78 (1980): 175–78, and N. Baglivi, "Osservazioni su Paneg. VII(6),9," ''Orpheus'' 7 (1986): 329–37, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Aeduan orators, who refer to Julius Caesar in the context of Gaul and Britain, are either directly familiar with his prose or know of his figure through intermediaries like [[Florus]], the historian.&lt;ref&gt;Klotz, "Studen zu den Panegyrici Latini," 546, 554, (cited at Nixon and Rodgers, 18 n.72) argues for the latter case; Nixon and Rodgers (at Nixon and Rodgers, 18) argue for the former.&lt;/ref&gt; Panegyric 12, meanwhile, contains a direct allusion to Caesar's ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili|Bellum civile]]''.&lt;ref&gt;At 12.6.1–2, alluding to ''Bellum civile'' 3.80.1–81.2, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accentual and metrical clausulae were used by all the Gallic panegyrists. All of the panegyrists, save Eumenius, used both forms at a rate of about 75 percent or better (Eumenius used the former 67.8 percent of the time, and the latter 72.4 percent).&lt;ref&gt;Steven M. Oberhelman and Ralph G. Hall, "Meter in Accentual Clausulae," ''Classical Philology'' 80:3 (1985): 222–23, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a common metrical rhythm at the time, but had gone out of style by the 5th century, when metrical considerations no longer mattered.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

The collection comprises the following speeches:
# by [[Pliny the Younger]]. It was originally a speech of thanks (''gratiarum actio'') for the [[consul]]ship, which he held in 100, and was delivered in the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] in honour of Emperor [[Trajan]]. This work, which is much earlier than the rest of the collection and geographically anomalous, probably served as a model for the other speeches.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 4; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny was a popular author in the late 4th  century—[[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]] modeled his letters on Pliny's, for example&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 7 n.22; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 22 n.84.&lt;/ref&gt;—and the whole collection might have been designed as an ''[[exemplum]]'' in his honor.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 7"&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He later revised and considerably expanded the work, which for this reason is by far the longest of the whole collection. Pliny presents Trajan as the ideal ruler, or ''optimus princeps'', to the reader, and contrasts him with his predecessor [[Domitian]].
# by [[Pacatus Drepanius|Pacatus]] in honour of Emperor [[Theodosius I]], delivered in [[Rome]] in 389.
# by [[Claudius Mamertinus]] in honour of Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], delivered in [[Constantinople]] in 362, also as a speech of thanks at his assumption of the office of consul of that year.
# by [[Nazarius (rhetorician)|Nazarius]]. It was delivered in [[Rome]] before the Senate in 321 at the occasion of the fifteenth anniversary of the accession of [[Constantine I]] and the fifth anniversary of his sons [[Crispus]] and [[Constantine II (emperor)]] becoming [[Caesar (title)|''caesares'']]. The speech is peculiar because none of the honoured emperors was present at its delivery, and because it celebrates Constantine's victory over [[Maxentius]] (at the [[Battle of Milvian Bridge]]) in 312, avoiding almost any reference to contemporaneous events.
# from the year 311, delivered in [[Trier]] by an anonymous orator, who gives thanks to Constantine I for a tax relief for his home town [[Autun]].
# by an anonymous (yet different) author, also delivered at the court in Trier in 310, at the occasion of Constantine's ''quinquennalia'' (fifth anniversary of accession) and the founding day of the city of Trier. It contains the description of an appearance of the sun god [[Apollo]] to Constantine, which has often been regarded as a model of Constantine's later [[Battle of Milvian Bridge|Christian vision]]. Also, the speech promulgates the legend that the emperor [[Claudius II]] was Constantine's ancestor.
# by an anonymous author delivered at the wedding of Constantine to [[Maximian]]'s daughter [[Fausta]] in 307, probably also at Trier, and it therefore contains the praise of both emperors and their achievements. The bride and the wedding feature only to a very limited degree in the oration.
# celebrates the reconquest of [[Roman Britain|Britain]] by [[Constantius Chlorus]], ''caesar'' of the [[tetrarchy]], from [[Allectus]] in 296. The speech was probably delivered in 297 in Trier, then the residence of Constantius.
# is the second speech in the collection where the emperor was not present. It is by [[Eumenius]], teacher of [[rhetoric]] at Autun, and is directed at the governor of the province of [[Gallia Lugdunensis]]. It was most probably delivered in 297/298, either in Autun or [[Lyon]]. Apart from its main subject, the restoration of the school of rhetoric at Autun, it praises the achievements of the emperors of the tetrarchy, especially those of Constantius.
# from the year 289 (and therefore the earliest of the [[Late Antiquity|late antique]] speeches of the collection), at Trier in honour of Maximian at the occasion of the founding day of the city of Rome. According to a disputed manuscript tradition, the author was a certain [[Claudius Mamertinus|Mamertinus]], who is identified with the author of the next speech.
# from 291, also at Trier to Maximian, at the emperor's birthday. It is often attributed to Mamertinus, probably ''magister memoriae'' (private secretary) of Maximian, though the text is corrupt and the authorship not entirely certain.
# by an anonymous orator, delivered in Trier in 313, celebrating (and describing extensively) Constantine's victory over Maxentius in 312. The author of this panegyric makes heavy use of Virgil.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==
The panegyrics exemplify the culture of imperial ''praesentia'', or "presence", also encapsulated in the imperial ceremony of ''[[Adventus (ceremony)|adventus]]'', or "arrival".&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 6–7. See also: S. MacCormack, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4435301 Change and Continuity in Late Antiquity: The Ceremony of "Adventus"]," ''Historia'' 21:4 (1972): 721–52; B.S. Rodgers, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4435950 Divine Insinuation in the "Panegyrici Latini"]," ''Historia'' 35:1 (1986): 69–104.&lt;/ref&gt; The panegyrics held it as a matter of fact that the appearance of an emperor was directly responsible for bringing security and beneficence.&lt;ref&gt;Van Dam, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The orators held this visible presence in tension with another, more abstract notion of the timeless, omnipresent, ideal emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Van Dam, 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The panegyrist of 291 remarked that the meeting between Diocletian and Maximian over the winter of 290/91 was like the meeting of two deities; had the emperors ascended the Alps together, their bright glow would have illuminated all of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;''Pan''. 11.10.4–5, 11.4, cited in Van Dam, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Panegyrics came to form part of the vocabulary through which citizens could discuss notions of "authority". Indeed, because panegyrics and public ceremony were such a prominent part of imperial display, they, and not the emperor's more substantiative legislative or military achievements, became the emperor's "vital essence" in the public eye.&lt;ref&gt;Van Dam, 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and tradition of the collection ==
=== Compilation and purpose ===
The formation of the ''Panegyrici Latini'' is usually divided into two or three phases. At first, there was a collection of five speeches by various anonymous authors from Autun, containing numbers 5 through 9 above.&lt;ref&gt;W. Baehrens, "Zur quaestio Eumeniana," ''Rheinisches museum fur philologie'' 67 (1912): 313; and Galletier, 1: xiii and xix, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the speeches 10 and 11, which are connected to Trier, were appended; when 12 joined the collection, is uncertain. At some later date, the speeches 2, 3 and 4 were added.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; They differ from the earlier orations because they were delivered outside of Gaul (in Rome and Constantinople), and because the names of their authors are preserved. Pliny's panegyric was set at the beginning of the collection as classical model of the genre.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 4"/&gt; Sometimes the author of the last speech, Pacatus, is credited as the editor of the final ''corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;As in R. Pichon, ''Les derniers écrivains profanes'' (Paris, 1906), 285–91, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 6 n. 18; Roger Rees, "The Private Lives of Public Figures in Latin Prose Panegyric," in ''The Propaganda of Power: The Role of Panegyric in Late Antiquity'', ed. Mary Whitby  (Boston: Brill, 1998), 99.&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is founded on the position of Pacatus' speech in the ''corpus''—second after Pliny's—and because of the heavy debt Pacatus owes to the earlier speeches in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, "Private Lives", 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the speeches in the borrow from their predecessors in the collection, Pacatus borrows the most, taking ideas and phraseology from almost all the other speeches. He is especially indebted to the panegyric of 313.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the collection is thematically unconnected and chronologically disordered, Nixon and Rodgers conclude that "it served no political or historical purpose", and was simply a tool for students and practitioners of panegyrical rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 7"/&gt; Roger Rees, however, argues that the circumstances of its composition (if Pacatus is taken as its compiler) suggest that it was intended to illustrate Gaul's continuing loyalty to Rome. Along the same line, Pacatus' speech of 389 might have been meant to reassure Theodosius (who had defeated the usurper [[Magnus Maximus]] in Gaul the previous year) that Gaul was completely loyal to him.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manuscript tradition ===
The ''Panegyrici Latini'' make up most of the sixteen pre-400 Latin prose speeches in praise of Roman emperors that survive today. (The remaining four consist of three fragmentary speeches from Symmachus and one speech by Ausonius.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt;) Only one manuscript of the ''Panegyrici Latini'' has survived into the 15th century, when it was discovered in 1433 in a monastery in [[Mainz]], Germany by [[Giovanni Aurispa|Johannes Aurispa]].&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 3–4"/&gt; That manuscript, known as M (Moguntinus), was copied several times before it was lost. Two branches of Italian manuscripts derive from a copy Aurispa made of M, X&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 35–36; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; These are also lost,&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; but twenty-seven manuscripts descend from the pair. The evidence of the surviving manuscripts suggests that Aurispa's copy of M was made in haste, and that the Italian manuscripts are generally inferior to the other tradition, H.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another independent tradition branches off of M: H (at the [[British Library]]: Harleianus 2480), N (at [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], Romania: Napocensis), and A (at the [[Uppsala University Library]]).&lt;ref name="NR36R19"&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 36; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; H and N are both 15th-century manuscripts, transcribed in a German hand. H shows corrections from a near-contemporary, ''h''. N was copied at some time between 1455 and 1460 by the German theologian Johannes Hergot.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 36"&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed investigation of the manuscripts by D. Lassandro has revealed that A derives from N and N derives from H.&lt;ref&gt;D. Lassandro, "I manoscritti HNA nella tradizione dei ''Panegyrici Latini''," ''Bolletino del Comitato per la preparazione della Edizione Nazionale dei classici Greci e Latini'' 15 (1967): 55–97, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 36, and Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; H is usually considered the best surviving manuscript.&lt;ref name="NR36R19"/&gt;

Modern editions of the ''Panegyrici'' incorporate variant readings from outside H.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when X&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are in agreement, they sometimes preserve the true reading of M against H. They also contain useful emendations from the intelligent humanist corrector of Vaticanus 1775.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 36"/&gt; Early print editions also prove helpful, as Livineius' 1599 Antwerp edition contains variant readings from the work of scholar Franciscus Modius, who made use of another manuscript at the [[abbey of Saint Bertin]] at [[Saint-Omer]] (Bertinensis).&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 36; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Bertinensis is now generally believed to be cognate with, rather than derived from, M. [[Johannes Cuspinian|Cuspinianus]]' 1513 Vienna edition has proved more problematic. The relationship of M to the manuscripts Cuspinianus used is a mystery, and additional material, varying in length from single words to whole clauses, is found in Cuspinianus' text and nowhere else. Some scholars, like Galletier, reject Cuspinianus' additions in their entirety; Nixon and Rodgers chose to judge each addition separately.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 36"/&gt; Puteolanus' 1476 Milan edition and ''h''{{'}}s corrections have also proved valuable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Pass the ring''' is a family or [[children's games|children's game]] that needs a [[ring (jewellery)|ring]] (or similar such small object). The "it" puts their hands together in a [[prayer|praying]]-like motion, with the ring between them. The remainder of the players line up beside each other with their hands in the same praying-like motion. The "it" must then walk down the line and slide their hands in between each player's hands. At some point, the "it" drops the ring or object into one of the players' hands as discreetly as possible. After walking down the line, the "it" picks a random person to guess who has the ring. A player that chooses correctly wins the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://revistaescola.abril.com.br/creche-pre-escola/brincadeiras-regionais-nordeste-passa-anel-700328.shtml Brincadeiras do Nordeste: Passa-Anel | Pré-escola - 4 e 5 anos | Nova Escola]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Pokémon (anime)|''Pokémon'' anime]]''' debuted in Japan on April 1, 1997, [[List of Pokémon episodes|with over 1000 episodes]] as of 2018. However, for various reasons, some have been taken out of rotation of reruns in certain countries, while others were altered or completely banned.

At this point, viewers started to complain of blurred vision, headaches, dizziness and [[nausea]].&lt;ref name="csi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; A few people even had [[seizure]]s, [[blindness]], convulsions, and lost consciousness.&lt;ref name="csi"/&gt; Japan's Fire Defense Agency reported a total of 685 viewers, 310 boys and 375 girls, were taken to hospitals by ambulances.&lt;ref name="csi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washington"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/pokemon.html|title=Pokemon on the Brain|date=March 11, 2000|publisher=Neuroscience For Kids|accessdate=2008-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washington"/&gt; Although many victims recovered during the ambulance trip, more than 150 of them were admitted to hospitals.&lt;ref name="csi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washington"/&gt; Two people remained hospitalized for over 2 weeks.&lt;ref name="washington"/&gt; Some other people had seizures when parts of the scene were rebroadcast during news reports on the seizures.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news | last =| first =| title = Japanese cartoon triggers seizures in hundreds of children| publisher = Reuters| date = 1997-12-17| url = http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9712/17/video.seizures.update/index.html| accessdate = 2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a small fraction of the 685 children treated were diagnosed with [[photosensitive epilepsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/seizure.asp|title=Fits to Be Tried|publisher=Snopes.com|accessdate=2008-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The news of the incident spread quickly through Japan. The following day the television station that had aired the episode, [[TV Tokyo]], issued an apology to the Japanese people, suspended the program, and said it would investigate the cause of the seizures.&lt;ref name="csi"/&gt; Officers acting on orders from the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]] questioned the program's producers about the cartoon's contents and production process.&lt;ref name="Wudunn"/&gt; The [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]] held an emergency meeting, discussing the case with experts and gathering information from hospitals. The series exited the airwaves.&lt;ref name="csi"/&gt;

Later studies showed that 5–10% of the viewers had mild symptoms that did not need hospital treatment.&lt;ref name="willy"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1442-200X.1998.tb02006.x|last1=Takahashi|first1=Takeo|last2=Tsukahara|first2=Yasuo|title=Pocket Monster incident and low luminance visual stimuli|journal=[[Pediatrics International]]|volume=40|issue=6|pages=631–637|publisher=Blackwell Science Asia|oclc= 40953034|year=1998|issn=1328-8067|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119944452/abstract|accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 12,000 children reported mild symptoms of illness, but their symptoms more closely resembled [[mass hysteria]] than a [[grand mal]] seizure.&lt;ref name="csi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/2001-05/pokemon.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319080522/http://csicop.org/si/2001-05/pokemon.html|archivedate=2008-03-19|title=Pokémon Panic of 1997|last=Radford|first=Benjamin|date=May 2001|publisher=Skeptical Inquirer|accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Radford B, Bartholomew R | title=Pokémon contagion: photosensitive epilepsy or mass psychogenic illness? | journal=South Med J | year=2001 | pages=197–204 | volume=94 | issue=2  | pmid=11235034 | doi=10.1097/00007611-200194020-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study following 103 patients over three years after the event found most of them had no further seizures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 2004|title=A Follow-up Survey on Seizures Induced by Animated Cartoon TV Program "Pocket Monster"|journal=Epilepsia|publisher=Copenhagen: E.

After the airing of "Dennō Senshi Porygon", the ''Pokémon'' anime took a four-month [[Hiatus (television)|break]] until it returned on April 16, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-03-27/10th-anniversary-of-pokemon-in-japan|title= 10th Anniversary of Pokemon in Japan|date=March 27, 2007|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="empire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bad.eserver.org/issues/2002/60/hamilton.html|title=Empire of Kitsch: Japan as Represented in Western Pop Media|last=Hamilton |first=Robert|date=April 2002|publisher=Bad Subjects|accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the hiatus, the time slot changed from Tuesday to Thursday.&lt;ref name="aki"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home-aki.cool.ne.jp/soudou.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216223620/http://home-aki.cool.ne.jp/soudou.htm|archivedate=2008-02-16|script-title=ja:ポケモン騒動を検証する|publisher=TVアニメ資料館|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pokémon theme songs|opening theme]] was also redone, and black screens showing various Pokémon in spotlights were broken up into four images per screen. Before the seizure incident, the opening was originally one Pokémon image per screen.&lt;ref name="aki"/&gt; Before the resumption of broadcast, {{nihongo|"Problem Inspection Report on Pocket Monster Animated Series"|アニメ ポケットモンスター問題検証報告|Anime Poketto Monsutā Mondai Kenshō Hōkoku}} was shown. Broadcast in Japan on April 11, 1998, host Miyuki Yadama went over the circumstances of the program format and the on-screen advisories at the beginning of animated programs, as well as showing letters and fan drawings sent in by viewers, most of whom were concerned that the incident would lead to the anime being cancelled.&lt;ref name="aki"/&gt; The seizures were actually caused by animation errors. After that episode aired, prior episodes with seizure-like effects were edited for rebroadcasting (especially the non-Japanese releases).

===Unaired episodes===

===="Battle of the Quaking Island! Dojoach vs. Namazun!!" (Episode 377)====
In "Battle of the Quaking Island! Dojoach ([[Barboach]]) vs. Namazun ([[Whiscash]])!!", Ash Ketchum has just finished the Mossdeep City Gym, and his next goal is the final Gym at Sootopolis City. Ash and friends journey toward Jojo Island on the way and are caught in an earthquake caused by [[Whiscash]]. They then meet a Pokémon trainer named Chōta.

The episode was originally set to air in Japan on November 4, 2004, between episode 376, "Solid as a Solrock", and episode 378, "Vanity Affair", but was skipped due to the episode's similarities to the [[2004 Chūetsu earthquake|Chūetsu earthquake]] on October 23, 2004. The episode was later postponed, but was skipped in rotation order and eventually discontinued. While most of the other episodes were either not dubbed for English-language release or taken out of English-language syndication rotations, this episode of ''Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation'' was the second episode not to air outside of Japan, and the first episode not to air in Japan. Since then the move Earthquake alongside similar moves such as Fissure and Magnitude have not been used in the anime. The episode did not end up as a DVD exclusive.

In the episode "Clemont's Got a Secret!" during the X&amp;Y series, the similar move Bulldoze would appear during a battle.

===="Team Rocket vs. Team Plasma!" (Episodes 682 &amp; 683)====
The two-part episode "Team Rocket vs. Team Plasma!" was originally scheduled to be broadcast on March 17 and March 24, 2011. The Pokémon Smash episode on the week that would've followed by the first part was preempted from broadcast due to the news coverage of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], before being postponed due to the content of the episodes wherein Castelia City is destroyed. There were plans for the episodes to be broadcast at a later date,&lt;ref name="castle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/program/detail/21304_201103171900.html|script-title=ja:ポケットモンスターＢＷ「ヒウンジム戦！純情ハートの虫ポケモンバトル！！」|publisher=[[TV Tokyo]]|date=March 17, 2011|accessdate=June 16, 2013|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there has been no such broadcast. Footage from this episode was later used in the episode "Meloetta and the Undersea Temple" originally broadcast on September 27, 2012, as well as in "Strong Strategy Steals the Show" originally broadcast on December 13, 2012. Another episode, "Hiun City Fishing Competition! Fishing Sommelier Dent Appears!!", was scheduled to be broadcast on April 7, 2011, but was postponed due to the tsunami as well. It was later retitled "Fishing Sommelier Dent Appears!!" and broadcast on June 23, 2011, with all references to Hiun (Castelia) City removed from the episode in order to fit into the new continuity.

=== Postponed episodes ===

===="An Undersea Place to Call Home!" (Episode 851)====
The episode "An Undersea Place to Call Home!", featuring Ash, Clemont, Serena, and Bonnie helping a [[Skrelp]] (Kuzumo) return to its family in a sunken cruise ship, was originally set to broadcast on April 24, 2014. However, the then recent [[sinking of MV Sewol|sinking of MV ''Sewol'']] led to the episode being pulled from its timeslot with plans for a later broadcast which Japan did eventually see officially on November 20, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-04-21/pokemon-xy-episode-about-sunken-passenger-ship-delayed|title=Pokémon XY Episode About Sunken Passenger Ship Delayed|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=April 21, 2014|accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/pokemon_xy/news/index.html#166032 |title= Pocket Monsters XY official website  |publisher=TV-Tokyo.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Pikachu Short": Pikachu &amp; Pichu===
The [[List of Pokémon films#Pikachu shorts|Pikachu short]] '''Pikachu &amp; Pichu''' (Japanese: ピチューとピカチュウ) has not re-aired or been released on home video or VOD in Japan since 2009 when the Japanese narrator, [[Noriko Sakai]], was arrested and later convicted of abuse and possession of drugs.

== Episodes removed in the United States ==
These episodes were never aired in the United States (with one notable exception of Episode 18). As a result, these episodes were never made available in any country airing the English dub, or a redub of this dub.&lt;ref name="ofepguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.com/#movies|title=Official episode guide of all American-dubbed episodes sorted by season pack|accessdate=2009-05-13|publisher=www.pokemon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Beauty and the Beach" (Episode 18)====
[[Image:Pokémon episode Beauty and the Beach - screen capture .jpg|thumb|right|Screenshot of the episode "Beauty and the Beach" when James shows off his inflatable breasts, offending Misty. The top right sign reads {{nihongo|"Contest"|コンテスト|Kontesuto}}.]]

"Beauty and the Beach" is the 18th episode of the original Japanese series. It was originally skipped by [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]] upon the original American broadcast of the series until 2000. On June 24, 2000, a newly produced English-language version of the episode aired on [[Kids' WB]] as "Beauty and the Beach". Promoted as a "lost episode" special presentation, it has only received one rerun and has not yet been shown elsewhere, nor was it included in the English Indigo League DVD boxset or the English Indigo League Champions Edition BluRay boxset released in November 2017. However, as of October 2018, the episode was showing (dubbed and in its correct place in the series) on a 24/7 ''Pokemon'' anime channel provided by streaming service KS Hosting.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In this episode, the female characters all enter a beauty contest. [[Team Rocket]] also enters, with James donning a suit with inflatable breasts. One scene of the episode involved James showing off his artificial breasts for humorous effect, taunting Misty by saying: "Maybe, one day when you're older, you'll have a chest like this!". In one scene, he puffs up his breasts to over twice their original size. When it was dubbed and aired in 2000, all scenes of James in a bikini (about 40 seconds) were edited. There were a number of other sexualized scenes, such as one in which Ash and Brock are stunned at the sight of Misty in a bikini and another in which an older man appears to be attracted to her. In addition, all Japanese text on signs, etc. remains intact in this episode, as opposed to other first-season episodes in which it was digitally replaced with English text. 

A continuity problem created with this episode's removal is due to a flashback in "Hypno's Naptime". Also, this episode marks the first time chronologically that Misty and Brock meet Gary and Delia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dogasu |url=http://dogasu.bulbagarden.net/comparisons/kanto/ep027.html |title=Japanese Episode 027 |publisher=Dogasu.bulbagarden.net |date= |accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="The Legend of Miniryu" (Episode 35)====
{{nihongo|"The Legend of Miniryu ([[Dratini]])"|ミニリュウのでんせつ|Miniryū no Densetsu}} was the second episode to be banned by 4Kids Entertainment. This was the 35th episode of the original Japanese series.

It was banned due to the appearance of [[firearm]]s throughout the episode, as well as a scene where Team Rocket's Meowth wears a mustache that looks too much like that of [[Adolf Hitler]]. The removal of this episode leads to continuity problems, as Ash captured 29 [[Tauros (Pokémon)#Tauros|Tauros]] in this episode, and he got #30 from Brock with one of his Safari Balls. The Tauros appear in later episodes and are used in Pokémon Tournaments by Ash, and only one episode briefly alludes to where they came from.

4Kids used footage of this episode in the Pokérap which means that they got the episode from Japan. There is no indication that the episode has been dubbed.

A clip from the episode where Ash, Misty and Brock are frightened after pulling up a Gyarados was used in the Pokérap during one of the daily segments and the clips of Rhyhorn, Dratini and Dragonair in the Pokérap are also from the episode.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===="The Ice Cave!" (Episode 252)====
{{nihongo|"The Ice Cave!"|こおりのどうくつ!|Kōri no Dōkutsu!}} would have been part of ''[[List of Pokémon: Master Quest episodes|Pokémon: Master Quest]]'' (season 5), but was skipped over by 4Kids Entertainment and therefore never shown outside of [[Asia]]. It was the first widespread ban of a Pokémon episode in four years. This episode, much like episode 39 "[[List of Pokémon: Indigo League episodes#ep39|Holiday Hi-Jynx]]" (though that episode was only removed from rotation in one country), was also banned because of the appearance of the controversial Pokémon [[Jynx]].&lt;ref name="fusion.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fusion.net/story/275036/nintendo-racist-pokemon-jynx/|title=How Nintendo changed this racist Pokémon's design for the better|first=Charles|last=Pulliam-Moore|date=|website=fusion.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people believed Jynx was a racial stereotype of Africans similar to those from ''[[The Story of Little Black Sambo]]'' because of its big pink lips and pure black skin, or that it looked like a [[blackface]] actress. Jynx was later re-edited and given purple skin instead in later episodes.&lt;ref name="fusion.net"/&gt;

=== Episodes removed by the Pokémon Company International ===
===="Satoshi and Nagetukesaru! A Touchdown of Friendship!!" (Episode 1005)====
"Satoshi ([[Ash Ketchum]]) and Nagetukesaru ([[Passimian]])! A Touchdown of Friendship!!" is the 1,005th episode of the series in general, and the 64th episode of the series ''Pocket Monsters Sun &amp; Moon''. It has no English title, and originally aired in Japan on March 1, 2018. The episode revolves around the Pokémon called Passimian, and during the course of the plot, Ash wears face paint to disguise himself as one of the creatures in a manner that somewhat resembles [[blackface]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/tv/pokemon-episode-pulled-from-us-tv-blackface-concerns-ash-disney-xd-2353254|title='Pokémon' episode pulled from airing in the US over 'blackface' concerns - NME|date=2018-07-12|work=NME|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first widespread ban of a Pokémon episode in 15 years, the first ban outside of the original ''Pocket Monsters'' series, and the first one during the Pokémon Company International era (2006–present).

==Episodes temporarily withdrawn in the United States after September 11, 2001==

{{See also| List of entertainment affected by the September 11 attacks}}

These episodes were temporarily removed after the [[September 11 attacks]] for destruction of buildings, the name, and/or weapons in the episode.&lt;ref name="ofepguide" /&gt; 

==="Tentacool and Tentacruel" (Episode 19)===
The first episode to be removed from rotation after the [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001, mainly because the censors noted similarities between the attacks and [[Tentacruel]] attacking the city. The character Nastina also used military-style weapons during the fight scenes in the episode. However, Tentacruel striking a building was not removed from the dub's opening theme, and the episode is still readily available on the home video and DVD markets. The episode was aired a month after the September 11 attacks, and was not aired in the US again until the series began airing on [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]].&lt;ref&gt;http://affiliate.zap2it.com/tvlistings/ZCGrid.do?fromTimeInMillis=1312574400000#54{{dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also not shown for a short time in 2005 following [[Hurricane Katrina]] as it portrays a city flooded underwater.

==="The Tower of Terror" (Episode 23)===
This episode was temporarily withdrawn after the [[September 11 attacks]] due to its title. It has since been aired in the regular episode rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tvlistings/ZCSGrid.do?stnNum=21883 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814222237/http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tvlistings/ZCSGrid.do?stnNum=21883 |archive-date=2017-08-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode features Ash and his friends travelling to Lavender Town to catch a Ghost Pokémon in the Pokémon Tower.

He was described as "the most popular pre-1900 recording artist".&lt;ref name=hoffman&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xV6tghvO0oMC&amp;pg=PA511&amp;lpg=PA511&amp;dq=%22russell+hunting%22+1943&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s9b2x0sqRN&amp;sig=p_m2ndPMTfp3_zDCeL6gvterzKc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W0-bUfrmEqnA0QXIwYDQAQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22russell%20hunting%22%201943&amp;f=false  Frank Hoffmann (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound, Volume 1'', CRC Press, 2004, p.511]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, Hunting recorded the earliest version of the [[baseball]] [[poem]] "[[Casey at the Bat]]" (Columbia Graphophone Grand, #9649). After that, his popular "Casey" format was often imitated.&lt;ref name=hound1/&gt;

In 1896 Hunting founded the first independent magazine for the recording industry, ''Phonoscope'', and set up a [[phonograph]] shop in [[New York City|New York]] with his partner Charles M. Carlson.&lt;ref name=hoffman/&gt;  He also, about this time, recorded a series of indecent recordings, for [[Bar (establishment)|saloon]]s and [[amusement arcade]]s on [[Coney Island]], using [[pseudonym]]s such as Manly Tempest and Willy Fathand.  Hunting was identified by his distinctive voice, and a detective working for [[Anthony Comstock]], the founder of the newly formed [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]] arrested him for violating [[obscenity]] laws.  Hunting was found guilty and spent three months in prison.&lt;ref name=hound2&gt;[http://soundofthehound.com/2011/06/15/russell-hunting-stories-2-1896-obscenity-filth-lasciviousness-the-record-business-discovers-smut-sells/ Sound of the Hound, ''Russell Hunting stories #2 1896: obscenity, filth, lasciviousness; the record business discovers smut sells!'', 15 June 2011]. Retrieved 21 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of Hunting's lewd recordings were included on the 2007 compilation ''[[Actionable Offenses: Indecent Phonograph Recordings from the 1890s]]''.

In 1898, a cylinder record company called [[Leeds Talk-O-Phone]] had Hunting record a skit, "Cohen at the Telephone". He was paid $5 per "round", as pantographic duplication yielded about 100 acceptable duplicates of a cylinder. At the end of the fourth round (recording into 4 machines yielded 16 masters) he saw a man carting 24 recordings of his "Cohen at the Telephone" away at the end of the studio. Hunting accused Leeds Talk-O-Phone of attempting to defraud him. The company, according to Hunting, made good upon being threatened with exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Rz0Z7AT8TwC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Tinfoil+to+stereo+cohen+at+the+telephone+leeds+and+catlin&amp;sig=ACfU3U1uJ-3ojUghl8PF1VIwQHB7ZXvzWA#PPA74,M1 |title=From the Tinfoil to Stereo: The Acoustic Years of the Recording Industry ... - Walter Walter Leslie Welch, Leah Brodbeck Stenzel Burt - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunting traveled to [[England]] in 1898, and became recording director of Edison Bell Records.&lt;ref name=hoffman/&gt;  After the [[United Kingdom]] became involved in the [[Boer War]] in 1899, he recorded "The Departure of the Troop Ship", with the sounds of "crowds at the quayside, bands playing the troops up the gang-plank, bugles sounding 'All ashore', farewell cries of 'Don’t forget to write', troops singing "Home Sweet Home", which gradually receded in the distance, and the far-away mournful hoot of the steamer whistle."  According to Fred Gaisberg, [[Nellie Melba]] said that the record influenced her above anything else to make records.&lt;ref name=hound4&gt;[http://soundofthehound.com/2011/06/17/russell-hunting-day-4-patriotic-recordings/ Sound of the Hound, ''Russell Hunting day #4: Patriotic recordings'', 17 June 2011]. Retrieved 21 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; While Hunting was in England, James H. White recorded "Casey" material for [[Edison Disc Records|Edison Records]], around 1901. Then, in 1905, John Kaiser became the voice of "Casey" for Edison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tinfoil.com |title=Early Recorded Sounds and Wax Cylinders |publisher=Tinfoil.com |date=1996-08-31 |accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunting also recorded skits for [[Zonophone Records|Zonophone]] in Britain.  In 1904, Hunting and Louis Sterling formed the Sterling Record Company, which became the Russell Hunting Record Company Ltd., in London.  The company produced Sterling cylinder records and [[Linguaphone (company)|Linguaphone]] language instruction records, but went out of business in 1908.  Hunting then joined the [[Pathé]] company in [[Paris]] as director of recording, traveling the world on the company's behalf, and setting up its US arm before returning to Pathé to take charge of its European recording activities.  He also maintained an occasional recording career, recording "The Departure of the First U.S. Troops for France", again with sound effects of bands and crowds, in New York in 1917.&lt;ref name=hoffman/&gt;

He finally returned to the US in 1940.  Hunting died in [[Westchester County, New York]], in 1943 at the age of 78.

"'''Ship in a Bottle'''" is the 138th episode of the American [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', the 12th episode of the [[Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 6)|sixth season]]. In this episode, which continued a plot line from the second season episode "[[Elementary, Dear Data]]", the fictional holodeck character [[Professor James Moriarty]] seizes control of the ''Enterprise'' in his quest to be freed to live in reality, outside the confines of a holographic environment.

==Plot==
[[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] and [[Geordi La Forge|La Forge]] are enjoying a [[Sherlock Holmes]] [[holodeck]] program when the two notice that a character programmed to be left-handed was actually right-handed.  They call [[Reginald Barclay|Lt. Barclay]] to repair the holodeck, but as he checks the status of the Sherlock Holmes programs, he encounters an area of protected memory.  He activates it to find the artificial [[Sentience|sentient]] [[Professor Moriarty|Professor James Moriarty]] ([[Daniel Davis]]) character projected into the Holodeck, who appears to have memory since his creation ("[[Elementary, Dear Data]]"), including during the period while he was inactive (a feat Picard claims to be impossible).  Moriarty wishes to escape the artificial world of the [[holodeck]] and was assured by the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise'']] that they would endeavor to find a way to free him, and is irritated at the lack of results on the part of the crew and their seeming lack of even the tiniest bit of effort.  [[Jean-Luc Picard|Picard]], along with Data and Barclay, attempts to assure Moriarty they are still working on that goal, but Moriarty is dismissive of that.

Moriarty confuses the crew by seemingly willing himself to existence by walking off the holodeck.  He explains this to the stunned Picard and Data by saying, [[Cogito ergo sum|"I think, therefore I am."]] Moriarty creates a companion for himself, the Countess Regina &lt;!--not "Virginia"--&gt; Bartholomew ([[Stephanie Beacham]]), commanding the computer of the ''Enterprise'' to place another sentient mind within a female character of the Sherlock Holmes novels.  Moriarty then demands that a solution to get Regina off the holodeck be devised.  He takes control of the ''Enterprise'' through the computer, insisting that a way be found for her to experience life beyond the confines of the holodeck.

While assisting LaForge, Data observes that LaForge's handedness is incorrect, just as they had experienced earlier.  Data determines that he, Picard, and Barclay never left the holodeck, and everyone and everything that appears to be the ''Enterprise'' is part of a holodeck program Moriarty created. At that moment, Picard realizes that he has unwittingly provided Moriarty with the command codes for the Enterprise.  With this information, Moriarty takes control of the real Enterprise from within his simulation.

Captain Picard finds a way to program the holodeck's simulation of a holodeck to convince Moriarty that he and Regina can be beamed into the real world, though in fact they are only "beamed" in the holodeck's simulation.  Moriarty, satisfied with the ruse, releases control of the ship back to Picard. He and the Countess use a [[Shuttlecraft (Star Trek)|shuttlecraft]] given to them by [[William Riker|Commander Riker]] to leave the ''Enterprise'' and explore the galaxy.  Picard ends the simulation and returns to the real ''Enterprise''.  Barclay extracts the memory cube from the holodeck and sets it in an extended memory device in order to provide Moriarty and the Countess a lifetime of exploration and adventure.

Picard mentions the possibility that the crew's reality may actually be a fabrication generated by "a little device sitting on someone's table." This unnerves Barclay enough for him to test the nature of his own reality one more time: he gives an audible command to "end program" to test whether he is still in a simulation.  There is no response.

'''Shlomi Bracha''' ({{lang-he|שלומי ברכה}}; born March 21, 1962) is an Israeli Rock musician and record producer, best known for being the guitarist and one of the songwriters in the Israeli rock band [[Mashina]].

==Biography==
Bracha was born March 21, 1962, in [[Kiryat Shalom]], [[Tel Aviv]], Israel. He met [[Yuval Banay]] in 1980 while they were serving together in the [[Israel Defense Forces]], and they formed a band. They split up after their army service, and Bracha formed the group ''HaChazit Ha'amamit'' ("The National Front") with bassist Michael Benson. In 1984 Bracha teamed up again with Banay and with drummer [[Iggy Dayan]] to form the band [[Mashina]]. Their self-titled debut album was released in 1985. Later [[Avner Hodorov]] joined the band on keyboard and saxophone.

In May 1995 the group disbanded after a series of four farewell shows. Bracha began co-writing with [[Rami Fortis]], and they released an album a few years later. He released a solo album, ''Chaplin Charlie'', in 2003, the same year that Mashina got back together and resumed recording and performing.

Aside from his musical career, Shlomi Bracha served as coach and mentor (alongside his teammate, Yuval Banay) on the television show [[The Voice Israel]] in the [[The Voice Israel (season 2)|second season]].

==Discography==

'''Tele2 AB''' is a European [[telecommunications operator]] headquartered in the [[Kista|Kista Science City]], Stockholm, Sweden. It is a major telephone operator in the Nordic and Baltic countries and an alternative provider in many others, with about 17 million customers in 8 countries.

Tele2 started as a telecommunications company in [[Sweden]] in 1993 by the company [[Industriförvaltnings AB Kinnevik]]. Tele2 operates in [[Sweden]], [[Croatia]], [[Estonia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Russia]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tele2.com/about/who-we-are/where-we-operate/|title=Where we operate|publisher=Tele2|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1981, a mobile phone provider called ''Comvik'' started as an alternative mobile phone operator to Televerket (today known as [[TeliaSonera|Telia Company]]). The cable television provider ''Kabelvision AB'' started in 1986. Comvik changed its name to become [[Comviq]] when the company got a [[GSM]] license in 1988 and started operating in 1992.

In 1991, [[Sweden]]'s first commercial ISP was started with the Swedish IP Network (SWIPnet, AS1257) by Industriförvaltnings AB Kinnevik, later known as  ''Tele2'', and in 1993 with telephone liberalisation in Sweden, Tele2 started to offer international calls.

The three companies of Comviq, Kabelvision, and Tele2 came together as the ''Tele2'' brand on fixed-line services and ''Comviq'' on mobile services in Sweden in 1997. International growth came in the form of acquisitions in [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Russia]] &amp; [[France]].

==Divestments==
Tele2's most recent development has been to realign its geographic footprint towards [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Nordic countries|Nordic region]] focusing on own infrastructure based operations which provide higher growth options and possibly better margins for the future.  One area of notable success has been the growth of the mobile Internet broadband connectivity. Tele2 has achieved the most success in Russian market, with a customer base increasing by the hundreds of thousands yearly.
[[Image:Map Tele2.svg|left|thumb|150px|Countries in which Tele2 operates are in green, countries in which Tele2 no longer operates are in red.]]
In 2007 the company sold its holdings in [[Belgium]] to Dutch operator [[KPN]], in [[France]] to [[SFR]] and activities in [[Spain]] and [[Italy]] to [[Vodafone Italy]], in [[Portugal]] to [[Clix (ISP)|Clix]] and in [[Switzerland]] to TDC Sunrise. In March 2008 Tele2 divested its Austrian [[Mobile virtual network operator|MVNO]] operations to [[Telekom Austria]], although retaining its fixed line and internet services. In June 2008 Tele2 sold its Liechtenstein and Luxembourg holdings to Belgian operator [[Belgacom]]. The same month Tele2 sold its Polish operations to Netia.

Tele2 also tried to sell its German unit in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcmoney.co.uk/news/152007118939.htm |title=Abcmoney.co.uk |publisher=Abcmoney.co.uk |date= |accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although no sale actually took place.

In 2005 they sold their [[Tele2 UK Services|UK &amp; Ireland fixed operations]] to the Carphone Warehouse for £8.7m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20051219/2713/#.UVQKWFdgKF8 |title=Tele2 sells up in Britain - The Local |publisher=Thelocal.se |date= |accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also pulled out of the Finnish market stating problems with the competitive and regulatory environment&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20050819/1921/#.UVQKZVdgKF8 |title=Tele2 pulls out of Finland - The Local |publisher=Thelocal.se |date= |accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the Finnish government had previously cancelled their 3G licence, due to not completing a network in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20050629/1682/#.UVQK_FdgKF8 |title=Finland cancels Tele2 3G licence - The Local |publisher=Thelocal.se |date= |accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tele2 commercially launched its 4G LTE network in the 1800&amp;nbsp;MHz and 2.6&amp;nbsp;GHz bands in November 2012. The 800&amp;nbsp;MHz LTE band was added in May 2014 and 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz in July 2015. Tele2 claimed an LTE population coverage of 90% in September 2015.&lt;ref name=gsa_lte&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolution to LTE Report|url=http://gsacom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/151013-Evolution_to_LTE_report.pdf|publisher=GSA|date=29 October 2015|accessdate=12 January 2016}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lithuania===
Tele2 operates a nationwide GSM 2G/3G/4G network in Lithuania.

===Netherlands===
{{Main|Tele2 Netherlands}}
Tele2 operates as a 2G/3G [[MVNO]] on the mobile network of T-Mobile and in the fourth quarter of 2015 will launch the world's first 4G-only [[MNO]] in the Netherlands with nearly 850,000 customers in addition to fixed network [[Triple play (telecommunications)|triple play services]], serving over one million customers in total.

Tele2 purchased Versatel in the Netherlands in mid-2005 which allowed it to move away from carrier select services via KPN and onto own infrastructure. The new ''Tele2 Netherlands'' offer a full suite of triple play services.

On 15 July 2010, Tele2 demonstrated the first LTE network in the Netherlands on the frequencies (2600&amp;nbsp;MHz) it was awarded licenses for earlier the same year.

In late 2010, Tele2 Netherlands acquired BBned from [[Telecom Italia]].

The telecom regulator in the Netherlands, Agentschap Telecom, held a multiband auction which concluded on 14 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agentschaptelecom.nl/actueel/nieuws/2012/multiband-frequentieveiling-afgerond|title=Multiband Frequentieveiling Afgerond|date=14 December 2012|accessdate=20 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231080501/http://www.agentschaptelecom.nl/actueel/nieuws/2012/multiband-frequentieveiling-afgerond|archivedate=31 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tele2 was awarded 2x10MHz in the 800&amp;nbsp;MHz band which together with its previous 2.6&amp;nbsp;GHz license will enable Tele2 to cost efficiently build a high capacity LTE network with national coverage. Tele2 paid €161M for its licenses which can be considered low, compared to the €1.3bn that KPN and Vodafone paid each for their frequencies and the €900M that T-Mobile will have to pay for theirs. The considerably lower price was a result of spectrum reservation set by the government for a new mobile entrant, with favourable acquisition, Tele2 will enable lower prices for customers and increase competition on the Dutch market. €3.8bn was raised in the auction, which is unprecedented for a country with a population of a mere 16 million.

In 2015, the organisation launched a new mobile network. The scheme cost approximately $187 million and had been in development since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentoreurope.com/resources/blogs/5-excellent-examples-of-successful-transformation-programs/|title=Mentor Europe 5 excellent examples of successful transformation programs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
Tele2 Norway consists of the brands Tele2, OneCall, MyCall and Network Norway. On 7 July 2014, it was announced that Tele2 would be acquired by [[TeliaSonera|Telia Company]]. On 5 February 2015, the deal was approved by Norwegian competition authorities.

===Russia===
{{Main|Tele2 Russia}}
Tele2 started the operations in the Russian Federation by acquiring 12 regional mobile operators from its sister company [[Millicom]] in 2001. This has been expanded to a current 43 regions and with a customer base of over 21 million subscribers, Russia is Tele2's largest market by customer base.

On 28 March 2013 Tele2 announced that they would sell their Russian operations to the bank [[VTB]] for US$2.4 billion plus $1.15 billion in net debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/tele2-to-sell-russian-operations-for-usd-24-bln--933996 |title=Tele2 to sell Russian operations for USD 2.4 bln |publisher=Telecompaper |date= |accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
{{Update|section|date=April 2017||reason=outdated information about 4G network written ''as of 2012''}}

Sweden is where Tele2 originated and it remains one of its strongest markets serving over 4 million customers.

When the [[Swedish Post and Telecom Authority]] awarded four licenses for the [[3G|3rd generation]] mobile networks in December 2001, Tele2 was among the winners. Notably Telia, the former telephony incumbent in Sweden, did not receive a license and so an agreement was established to build a 3G network jointly by Tele2 and Telia using Tele2s license. [[SUNAB]] builds, owns and operates that 3G network.

A similar company, [[Net4Mobility]], was formed in 2009 between Tele2 and Telenor for the purpose of building a joint 4G LTE network. Unlike 3G, both the parent companies were awarded frequency licenses and so it is likely that this network will outperform other Swedish operators networks simply because there are more available frequencies for the customers. The 4G product was officially launched on 15 November 2010 and currently (as of May 2012) covers over 90 [[municipalities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tele2.se/kundservice/drift-och-tackning/4G-natet.aspx|title=Upptäck 4G från Tele2|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029034128/http://www.tele2.se/kundservice/drift-och-tackning/4G-natet.aspx|archive-date=29 October 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "National" coverage, able to serve 99% of the population in Sweden, has an expected completion date at the end of 2012. As the equipment used by Net4Mobility can serve both LTE and 2G, the new network built primarily for LTE will also replace the aging 2G networks of Tele2 and Telenor, providing lower cost through shared infrastructure. In addition, it enables [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]], a service previously not available via Tele2.

In Italy the company was also criticised for blocking P2P traffic without warning its consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2009/01/sezioni/tecnologia/p2p/tele2-limita/tele2-limita.html|title=Tele2 limita il p2p sulla sua rete ma ai clienti non lo dice: multa - Tecnologia - Repubblica.it|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was also criticised for [[2009 Latvian meteorite hoax|faking a meteorite landing in Latvia]] in October 2009, as a result of which the Latvian government cancelled its contract with Tele2.&lt;ref&gt;

It is currently{{when|date=May 2017}} under investigation for competition and acquisition irregularities in Lithuania, as well as losing its case brought by its Lithuanian competitor through the competition watchdog over [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] ad speed claims.

It has grown a reputation for aggressive market practice and has been involved in court cases and legal criticisms in several other countries, including Poland.

Tele2 pulled out of the Finnish market stating problems with the competitive and regulatory environment&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; after the Finnish government had previously cancelled their 3G licence.

'''''The Archie Show''''' (Also known as The Archies) is an American [[animated series|animated]] [[musical film|musical]] [[television comedy|comedy]] series produced by [[Filmation]] for [[CBS]]. Based on the [[Archie Comics|Archie comic book]]s, created by [[Bob Montana]] in 1941, ''The Archie Show'' aired [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday mornings]] on [[CBS]] from September 1968 to August 1969, when it was replaced by an hour-long version, ''The Archie Comedy Hour''. Filmation continued to produce further ''Archie'' television series until 1978.

==Overview==
The show revolves around 17-year-old [[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie Andrews]] and his teen-age pals from [[Riverdale High School (comics)|Riverdale High School]] including: his best friend and food fiend [[Jughead Jones]], wise-cracking [[Reggie Mantle]], beautiful, spoiled-rich girl [[Veronica Lodge]], and attractive, blonde, girl-next-door tomboy [[Betty Cooper]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;CD liner notes: Saturday Mornings: Cartoons’ Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records&lt;/ref&gt; On the show, the friends appeared as a [[bubblegum pop]] band featuring Archie on lead guitar. ''[[The Archies]]'' had a real-life #1 hit single in 1969 with their song, "[[Sugar, Sugar]]", written by [[Jeff Barry]] and [[Andy Kim]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

''The Archie Show'' utilized a [[laugh track]], the first such example of the colloquially-titled [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;2007 Interview with Lou Scheimer from ''The Archie Show: The Complete Series (1968)'' DVD, Disc 2&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the success of ''The Archie Show'', most animated series would begin using laugh tracks until the early 1980s. Previous animated series that used laugh tracks, such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and ''[[The Jetsons]]'', were broadcast during [[prime time]] with the target audience being adults.

A typical episode started with the first Archie story, introduced by Archie and occasionally a different character. Next was a "dance of the week" segment starting with a teaser, then after the commercial break Archie introduced the dance, followed by the song of the week performed by [[The Archies]]. After that was a short joke followed by the second Archie story. All 17 episodes were presented in this format.

==Production==
''The Archie Show'' was designed to emulate the live-action series ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' by including rock music into each episode.&lt;ref name="Erickson92"&gt;Erickson, 2005. p.92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lead singer Ron Dante and the songwriters of "Sugar Sugar", Andy Kim and Jeff Barry have verified that "Sugar, Sugar" was always meant for The Archies.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The franchise's most notable effort was the music element in the form of the animated band, [[The Archies]]. With vocals provided by [[Ron Dante]] and [[Toni Wine]], the fictional group released a series of real-life albums and singles. Their most successful song is "[[Sugar, Sugar]]", which stood at the top of the pop charts for four weeks in 1969. "Sugar, Sugar" became the number 1 song of 1969 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] charts. (There are also many songs, however, that only appeared on the show and its various spin-offs.)

A cover of "Sugar, Sugar", performed by [[Mary Lou Lord]] with [[Semisonic]], is included on the 1995 [[tribute album]] ''[[Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits (album)|Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits]]'', produced by [[Ralph Sall]] for [[MCA Records]].

The show's main composer [[Ray Ellis]] would later work on other [[Filmation]] projects (using the name of his wife, Yvette Blais).

==Formats==
*''The Archie Show'' (1968–69)
*''Archie and His New Pals'' (TV special; 1969): Big Moose and Reggie compete against each other for Class President; Sabrina is introduced as a new Riverdale High student.
*''The Archie Comedy Hour'' (1969–70): all new material, now in an hour-long format, contains two Sabrina segments, one at the start of the show, and one at the end, with a new "The Funhouse" joke segment in the middle that is loosely based on ''[[Laugh-In]]'', and contains regular segments such as Sabrina's Magic Trick and Dilton Doily's Inventions. There was a "Side Show" segment of one-liner jokes, followed by an Archies music segment.
*''Archie's Funhouse'' (1970–71): expanded version of the previous season's "Funhouse" format, now featuring an audience of live-action kids and the "Giant Jukebox"; a music-heavy incarnation of the series, originally padded to one hour with repeats of ''The Archie Show'' segments.
*''[[Archie's TV Funnies]]'' (1971–73): Archie and the gang run a TV station, presenting a selection of cartoons featuring characters from classic comic strips.
*''Everything's Archie'' (1973–74): repeats of previously released material.
*''[[The U.S. of Archie]]'' (1974–76): Archie and the gang interpret various events from American history.
*''[[The New Archie and Sabrina Hour]]'' (1977–78): new Archie and Sabrina episodes plus repeats of earlier material. The series was divided into two separate 30-minute shows: ''The Bang-Shang Lollapalooza Show'' (Archie) and ''Super Witch'' (Sabrina).
*''[[Hero High]]'' (1981): part of ''[[The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!]]'' was to have featured Archie and the gang as superheroes; however, this series was altered at the last minute because Filmation's rights to the "Archie" characters had expired during production and was not renewed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jackson_king/archive/2003/12/04/1141.aspx Jim Hill Media: 2003-12-04]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New Archie and Sabrina Hour'' was subsequently divided into ''The Bang-Shang Lalapalooza Show'' and ''Super Witch'' during its original network run. While the earlier Archie programs were broadcast by  CBS, these last two series were on NBC. It was later repeated in syndication, and on ''[[ABC Family|The Family Channel]]'' in a half-hour format as ''The Archie and Sabrina Surprise Package''; this is the version offered by [[Universal Television]], the current rightsholder for most Filmation programs, including The Archies franchise; a previous rightsholder, [[Entertainment Rights]], was acquired by Classic Media in 2009, followed by DreamWorks Animation's purchase of Classic Media in 2012.

Most episodes from all of these series were [[television syndication|syndicated]] in 1976 as ''The Archies'' (excluding material produced for ''The New Archie and Sabrina Hour'', which did not debut until a year later). The music segments from "Comedy Hour" were missing in this syndication package, for unknown reasons.

In 2010, the show began airing on [[Retro Television Network]].

==Home release==
Single-disc DVD compilations featuring four episodes each were released in 2004.  There were four volumes in all:
* '''''Archie &amp; Friends'' Featuring ''The Archie Show''''' includes three episodes of ''The Archie Show'' (#9, #3 and #5 as per Genius Entertainment's ''Complete Series'' DVD set; #9 has the song and dance segments substituted from #16). Also included is one episode of ''U.S. Of Archie'' ("The Star Spangled Banner") and a segment from ''The Archie Comedy Hour'' (from show #1, "Coke Machine," as per the Genius Entertainment ''Archie's Funhouse: The Complete Series'' DVD set).
* '''''Archie &amp; Friends'' Featuring ''Sabrina The Teenage Witch''''' includes three ''Sabrina'' half-hours ("Pet Shop"/"Funny Bunny," "Blue Whale"/"Football Game," and "Frankie"/"Beached"), one episode of ''U.S. Of Archie'' ("The Day Of The Ladies") and a segment from ''The Archie Comedy Hour'' ("Shadow Boxing" from show #1 as per Genius Entertainment's ''Archie's Funhouse: The Complete Series'' DVD set).
* '''''Archie &amp; Friends'' Featuring ''Archie's TV Funnies''''' includes three episodes of ''Archie's TV Funnies'' ("Riverdale Grand Prix Auto Race," "The Riverdale Air Circus," and "The Ghost Of Swedlow Swamp"), one episode of ''U.S. Of Archie'' ("The Wright Brothers"), and a segment from ''The Archie Comedy Hour'' ("Jughead Pulls Fire Hose" from show #3 as per Genius Entertainment's ''Archie's Funhouse: The Complete Series'' DVD set).
* '''''Archie &amp; Friends'' Featuring ''Archie's Classic Cartoons''''' includes one episode each of ''The Archie Show'' ("Rocket Rock"/"Par One"), ''The Archie And Sabrina Surprise Package'' ("Tops In Cops"), ''Archie's TV Funnies'' ("Flying Saucer"), ''U.S. Of Archie'' ("The Roughrider"), and a segment from ''The Archie Comedy Hour'' ("Telephone" from show #6 as per Genius Entertainment's ''Archie's Funhouse: The Complete Series'' DVD set).

On July 31, 2007, [[Genius Products]] released ''The Archie Show'' on DVD in Region 1 for the first time. According to the packaged booklet, the negatives for the dance (the "Drag")/song ("Hide and Seek") segment on the "Kids' Day/Jughead 'Sampson' Jones" episode were lost and had to be sourced from a mediocre video transfer; not even the [[PAL]] video transfers were available (many of [[Entertainment Rights]]' Region 1 Filmation releases are sourced from PAL-based video transfers, including this series). The video transfer is [[NTSC]]-based. In addition, the introduction to the dance segment which occurs before going to the commercial is also lost, along with the "joke" segment featured between the weekly song and second ''Archie'' story.

On March 4, 2008, [[Genius Products]] released ''Archie's Funhouse'' on DVD in Region 1 for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Archies-Fun-House-Complete-Series/8563/ |title=tvshowsondvd.com |publisher=tvshowsondvd.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508145228/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Archies-Fun-House-Complete-Series/8563 |archivedate=2011-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the previous release however, there is no packaged booklet, and thus there is no additional information other than the bonus features contained on the discs. Additionally, while the original negatives for the "[[Sugar, Sugar]]" video were found, the "[[Jingle Jangle (The Archies song)|Jingle Jangle]]" video was sourced from an NTSC-based video transfer (however, the negatives were recovered for two episodes of the show: episodes 15 and 16; all other episodes [including the "Funhouse" segments from ''The Archie Comedy Hour''] were sourced from the PAL video masters). The 16 episodes themselves are presented in re-edited half-hour formats. Missing are brief bumpers and repeated segments from ''The Archie Show'', already released in their own collection. The set also includes the TV special ''Archie And His New Pals'' and seven compilation episodes culled from ''The Archie Comedy Hour'' (but featuring the ''Archie's Funhouse'' opening and closing titles). The seven compilation episodes account for the "Funhouse" and "Side Show" segments from 14 episodes of ''The Archie Comedy Hour''. No other music segments from that season (apart from "Sugar, Sugar," "Jingle Jangle," and a performance of "Get On The Line" from ''Archie And His New Pals'') are included. This leaves two original episodes of ''The Archie Comedy Hour'' unrepresented altogether; that season's original opening, closing and bumpers are also absent. Genius Entertainment released the ''Sabrina The Teenage Witch'' segments from that season on DVD as part of their own set on April 29, 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3445">[[File:Walter Van Brunt.jpg|thumb|1921 portrait of Van Brunt (as Walter Scanlan)]]

'''Walter Van Brunt''' (April 22, 1892 &amp;ndash; April 11, 1971) was an [[United States|American]] tenor known initially for his recordings on [[Thomas Alva Edison]]'s [[Blue Amberol Records]] and later for his role in a scandal involving a [[stage name]] and case of [[adultery]].

==Biography==
Van Brunt began his singing career at age 17 as an imitator of singer [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]]. He was soon performing with [[Ada Jones]] and [[John Bieling]] as well as the [[American Quartet (ensemble)|American Quartet]]. He worked in [[vaudeville]] and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], including in the musical ''[[Eileen (musical)|Eileen]]''. Van Brunt had 40 hits on pop charts, including his 1914 duet with [[Elizabeth Spencer (soprano)|Elizabeth Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|wPGgaJMVQv8|Edmundsrex information on Walter Van Brunt}}, [[YouTube]]. Accessed 10 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, Van Brunt began using the name '''Walter J. Scanlan''' (newspapers sometimes erroneously rendered the name as "Scanlon"), which was the name of a late 19th-century Irish tenor who had had an established career before dying but never made any recordings. It has been suggested, but not proved, that the [[Irish-American]] composer of ''[[Eileen (musical)|Eileen]]'', [[Victor Herbert]], had encouraged the use of this stage name when he cast Van Brunt as the leading man. It was not a secret that this was a stage name: ''[[The New York Times]]'' review of ''Eileen'' stated that Scanlan’s real name was Van Brunt.&lt;ref&gt;"''Eileen'' Brim Full of Rich Melodies", ''The New York Times'', March 20, 1917, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Van Brunt later had a bigamous affair with a woman known as Ruth Scanlan, siring a child with her and prompting his wife Lillian to sue for divorce, which was granted in 1925 by an [[Irish-American]] judge who, in announcing his decision that Van Brunt should pay alimony, criticized Van Brunt's character.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Sutton, [http://www.mainspringpress.com/vanbrunt.html "The Walter Scanlan Scandal: The Rest of the Walter Van Brunt Story"] on Mainspring (accessed 10 February 2010). Van Brunt, as indicated by the [[tussenvoegsel]] ''Van'', was of Dutch not Irish extraction.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1929 to 1933, Murray used Van Brunt on various radio programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/artists/C4059 "Walter Van Brunt"] listing among the "Songwriters' Friends", [http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/ Songwriters Hall of Fame]. Accessed 10 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, Scanlon and Billy Murray provided the voices for the Fleischer short animation film ''[[Finding His Voice]]'', produced by [[Western Electric]].
