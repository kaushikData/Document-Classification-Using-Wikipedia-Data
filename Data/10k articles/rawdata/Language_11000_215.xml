'''Biao Min''', or '''Biao-Jiao Mien''', is a [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien language]] of China. The two varieties, Biao Min and Jiaogong Mian, are evidently not mutually intelligible.

==Distribution==
Ethnologue reports the Biao Min language to be spoken in the following counties in China.
*Northeastern [[Guangxi]]: [[Quanzhou County]], [[Guanyang County]], and [[Gongcheng County]]
*Southern [[Hunan]]: [[Shuangpai County]] and [[Dao County]]

==Dialects==
Dialects of Biao Min are as follows, according to Mao Zongwu (2004). Only the Biao Min varieties of Dongshan Yao Ethnic Township, Quanzhou County (全州县东山瑶族乡) and Sanjiang Township, Gongcheng County (恭城县三江乡) have been described in any detail.

*'''Dongshan 东山''' dialect: 35,000 speakers in Shuanglong, Huanglong village, Dongshan township, [[Quanzhou County]] (全州县东山乡黄龙村双龙屯); autonym: ''bjau31 min31''.
*'''Shikou 石口''' dialect: 8,000 speakers in Shikou village, Sanjiang township, [[Gongcheng County]] (恭城县三江乡石口村); autonym: ''mɔu31 jɔu55''. Also known as '''Chao Kong Meng''' ({{zh|交公勉语}})&lt;ref&gt;http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/numeral/ChaoKongMeng.htm&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Moruo''' ({{zh|莫若}}) (Mao 2004:306).
*'''Niuweizhai 牛尾寨''' dialect:  2,000 speakers in Niuwei village, Sanjiang township, [[Gongcheng County]] (恭城县三江乡牛尾村); autonym: ''mɔ433 ɕi53''. Also known as '''Moxi''' ({{zh|莫西瑶语}}).&lt;ref&gt;http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/numeral/Moxi.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Yoshihisa Taguchi (2005)&lt;ref&gt;[http://d.g.wanfangdata.com.cn/Periodical_mzyw200502002.aspx 三江史门勉语的音韵特点].&lt;/ref&gt; gives the autonym ''mo2 xi2 mũ2'', as well as the location of Xiaolitian village 小栗田村.

Strecker (1987) uses "Chao Kong Meng" for Shikou, and "Moxi" for Niuweizhai.&lt;ref name="Strecker"&gt;Strecker, David. 1987. "[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/strecker1987hmong.pdf The Hmong-Mien Languages]." In ''Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area'', 10 , no. 2: 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Word lists for Biao Min dialects can be found in Mao Zongwu (2004).

===Quanzhou County===
Biao Min of [[Quanzhou County]], Guangxi consists of the following five dialect areas (''Quanzhou County Almanac'' 全州县志).&lt;ref name="Almanac"&gt;http://www.gxdqw.com/bin/mse.exe?seachword=&amp;K=c&amp;A=45&amp;rec=643&amp;run=13&lt;/ref&gt;

*Qingshui 清水, Zhuwu 竹坞, Shangtang 上塘, Xiaoheping 小和平, Huangladong 黄腊洞, Huanglong 黄龙, Leigongyan 雷公岩
*Baizhu 白竹, Jingrong 锦荣, Daping 大坪
*Bailing 白岭, Liuzijie 六字介, Shijianping 石枧坪
*Gumu 古木
*Xieshui 斜水

Xieshui 斜水 is the most divergent dialect, and is unintelligible with the other four dialects. The Xieshui dialect also has more Chinese influence than the other Biao Min dialects do.&lt;ref name="Almanac"/&gt;

===Guanyang County===
Biao Min of [[Guanyang County]], Guangxi consists of the following two dialect areas (''Guanyang County Almanac'' 灌阳县志).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gxdqw.com/bin/mse.exe?seachword=&amp;K=c&amp;A=80&amp;rec=326&amp;run=13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bukhori''' ([[Tajiki language|Tajiki]]: бухорӣ – ''buxorī'', Hebrew script: בוכארי ''buxori''), also known as '''Bukhari''' and '''Bukharian''', is a dialect of the [[Tajiki language]] spoken in [[Central Asia]] (and in the diaspora) by [[Bukharian Jews]].

== General information ==

The location where Bukharic exists is in Central Asia.&lt;ref name="Birnbaum, Salomo A 2011"&gt;Birnbaum, Salomo A. 2011. ''Ein Leben für die Wissenschaft.'' Germany: De Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; The language classification of Bukharic is as follows: Indo-European &gt; [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] &gt; [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] &gt; [[West Iranian]] &gt; Southwest Iranian &gt; [[Persian language|Persian]] &gt; [[Tajik language|Tajik]] &gt; Bukharic.&lt;ref name="Tolmas, Chana 2006"/&gt;

Bukhori is based on a substrate of classical [[Persian language|Persian]], with a large number of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[loanword]]s, as well as smaller numbers of loanwords from other surrounding languages, including [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The vocabulary consists of a mixture of Persian, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Uzbek, and Hebrew words.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Shterenshis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vJZm9amnoAoC&amp;pg=PA84 ''Tamerlane and the Jews'' p. 85]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early history of the Bukharian Jews, Central Asia fell under Sunni Uzbek control. The Bukharian Jewish community was severely discriminated against and isolated from the other Jews, as well as the Uzbek people. This pushed Bukharian Jews to create their own branch of Judaism, which lead to the creation of the Bukhori dialect spoken throughout Bukharian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/bukharan-Jews|title=Bukharan Jews|last=Sloame|first=Joanna|date=2016|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|language=english|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the total number of speakers was 85,000. In the USSR, there were 45,000 speakers; in Israel, there were 32,000; and in all other countries combined, there were 3,000. One of the dialects of Bukharic is Rahamĭm.&lt;ref name="Tolmas, Chana 2006"/&gt; Ethnic Tajik minorities exist in many countries, such as [[Afghanistan]], Pakistan, and [[Uzbekistan]]. Later Samarkand and Bukhara in Uzbekistan are two cities which are particularly populated.&lt;ref&gt;Ido, Shinji. 2007. ''Bukharan Tajik.'' E.C.: LINCOM EUROPA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the language is spoken by approximately 10,000 [[Jew]]s remaining in Uzbekistan and surrounding areas, although most of its speakers reside elsewhere, predominantly in [[Israel]] (approximately 50,000 speakers), and the [[United States]].

Like most [[Jewish languages]], Bukhori traditionally used the [[Hebrew alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/bukhori.htm|title=Bukhori (бухорӣ / בוכארי / بخاری) language|website=www.omniglot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; But throughout the past century, due to Soviet influence, Bukhori has been written in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] in the 1920s, then [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] from 1940 onwards. The Hebrew alphabet fell further into disuse outside of Hebrew liturgy when the Bukharian Jewish schools were closed in Central Asia and Bukharian Jewish publications, such as books and newspapers, began to appear using the Cyrillic alphabet. Today, many older Bukharian Jews who speak Bukharian only know the Cyrillic alphabet when reading and writing Bukharian. The origin of its respective spelling system is Talmudic orthography.&lt;ref name="Birnbaum, Salomo A 2011"/&gt;

During the Soviet period, [[communists]] wanted Hebrew to be the language of culture and instruction in the Republic of Turkestan and in the Soviet’s People Republic of Bukhara. In late 1921, the Turkestani People’s Commissariat of Education ordered that schools for Bukharan Jews to teach in Bukharic and not in Hebrew. In Uzbekistan in 1934, 15 Bukharan Jewish clubs and 28 Bukharan Jewish red teahouses existed. However, in 1938, Bukharic was no longer used as the language for instruction in the schools and in cultural activities.&lt;ref name="Tolmas, Chana 2006"/&gt;

There were attempts made to bring back Bukharan Jewish culture in the [[Soviet Union]]. One significant attempt was a council was established for Bukharan Jewish literature in the Uzbekistan Writers’ Union and was headed by Aharon Shalamaev-Fidoi (Shalamaev-Fidoi left for Israel in 1991). Another significant attempt was the ''Hoverim'' society was established in Tajikistan and was headed by Professor Datkhaev (Datkhaev left for the USA in 1992).&lt;ref&gt;Tolmas 2006, 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; An organization today that is continuing to support the Bukharan Jewish culture is the World Bukharian Jewish Congress. This organization is introducing to the public the unique story of the Bukharan Jews. Their goal is for others to learn about the history of the Bukharan Jews, as well as their culture, language and literature. Based on the Soviet census of 1979, 20% more of Central Asian Jews spoke Russian instead of Bukharic.&lt;ref name="Tolmas, Chana 2006"/&gt;

Among some Bukharian Jewish youth, especially in the New York City area, there has been a revival of using the Bukharian Jewish language written in a modified Latin alphabet similar to the one developed by Bukharian Jewish linguist and writer, Yakub Kalontarov.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Today, youths learning the Bukharian Jewish language sponsored by the Achdut-Unity Club in Queens use the modified Latin alphabet.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Classes on Bukharian Jewish history and the Bukhori language are also available at [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College, CUNY]] since 2010, marking the first time that Bukhori has been taught in an American university. The classes are taught by Bukharian adjunct professor Imanuel Rybakov.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.cuny.edu/mu/podcasts/2010/05/10/saving-bukharian-jewish-history/|title=Saving Bukharian Jewish History  –  CUNY Radio Podcasts – CUNY|website=www1.cuny.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=July 2012}}
In [[broadcasting]], a '''commercial bumper''', '''ident bumper''' or '''break-bumper''' (often shortened to '''bump''') is a brief announcement, usually two to fifteen seconds in length that can contain a [[voice over]], placed between a pause in the program and its [[advertising|commercial]] break, and vice versa. The host, the program announcer or a [[continuity announcer]] states the title (if any) of the presentation, the name of the program, and the [[broadcast network|broadcast]] or [[cable television|cable]] network, though not necessarily in that order. On children's television networks, they are sometimes called '''external eyecatches''' due to the resemblance of [[Eyecatch|internal eyecatches]] in [[anime]] and there is usually no voice over, but some bumpers do feature one. [[Bumper music]], often a recurring [[signature song|signature]] or [[theme music]] segment, is nearly always featured. Bumpers can vary from simple text to short [[film]]s.

== United States ==
Since 1976, most network [[television program]]s in the [[United States]] no longer use commercial bumpers; although some [[soap opera]]s such as ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' (which stopped using one in 2010) and ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', as well as the [[game show]] ''[[The Price is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price is Right]]'', still feature mid-show bumpers. Commercial bumpers are still a common feature of [[radio]]. In radio, they are often used during sports broadcasts to ease the transition from [[play by play]] to commercial break and back to [[live action]], as well as notify local stations that they should insert their [[station identification]] and/or commercials, many times using obscure musical selections of the [[board operator]]'s choosing. One notable example of commercial bumpers still in use can be found on [[Cartoon Network]]'s late night programming block, [[Adult Swim]], whose extensive usage of bumpers has even spawned its own website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bumpworthy.com bumpworthy.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of commercial bumpers in radio was their use in [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated programming]]; for instance, the radio countdown programs ''[[American Top 40]]'' and ''[[American Country Countdown]]'' feature a series of pre-recorded jingles and other outcues to transition to and from commercial breaks.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, in accordance with then-current regulations set by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] that required a distinction between programs and commercials, most children's programming bumpers would include the phrase "We'll be [right] back after these messages", except for the bump before the final commercial break, which would usually say, "And now, these messages." The FCC significantly relaxed these rules in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Jerome L. ''Handbook of Children and the Media'' (Sage, 2002). 385-386. {{ISBN|978-0-7619-1955-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another common bumper phrase was "And now, a word from our sponsor."

== United Kingdom ==
In the [[United Kingdom]], a '''break-bumper''' is a brief appearance of a logo before or after [[advertising]] breaks, usually that of the [[television channel]] being watched.

Break-bumpers can either be animated or static. They are sometimes branded to advertise a special programme or event that will be broadcast on that channel, such as sporting events.

== Australia ==
In [[Australia]], a '''break-bumper''' can be a brief appearance of a programme logo, animated logo, title card or an animated title card, just before an [[advertising]] break.

Break-bumpers can also be either animated or static information bars that appear for a few seconds, with program title and the logo of the [[television channel]] being watched. These are more often seen after a break and sometimes followed by information bars that show what programme is coming next or later.

== Japan ==
In [[Japan]], an {{Nihongo|eyecatch|アイキャッチ|aikyatchi}} or internal eyecatch is a scene or illustration used to begin and end a commercial break in a television program, especially in [[anime]] and [[tokusatsu]] shows. The term is used, in Japan, to refer to all kinds of bumpers.

In many television series, eyecatches are contemporaneous into the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of a story, leading onto speculation during the commercial break.

Unlike in American programs, in which bumpers are typically supplied by the network (when they have them at all), eyecatches are almost always produced by the production company and considered a part of the program itself, rather than (or also serving as) a segue into a commercial break. They are typically two to six seconds in length. Eyecatches for children's programs are often longer and more elaborate, while eyecatches for programming intended for adults may consist of nothing more than the program's logo against a black background.{{Or|date=April 2008}}

== Malaysia ==
In the 1990s, commercial bumpers were used by terrestrial television networks. Similar to those in the United Kingdom, it is a short appearance of a logo or a slide to remind the viewers of the programme being aired, which appears before or after breaks. The logo is usually that of the [[television channel]] or [[television station|station]] being watched and/or of the programme's title. However, as the years passed on until the late 2000s, this changed to feature a message that the programme will return after the break ends, which is now more commonly seen on [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia|RTM]]'s [[TV1 (Malaysia)|TV1]] and [[TV2 (Malaysia)|TV2]] and [[Media Prima]]'s [[ntv7|NTV7]], [[8TV (Malaysia)|8TV]] and [[TV9 (Malaysia)|TV9]]. [[TV3 (Malaysia)|TV3]] also uses this for sponsored programmes, but as of 2013, it also uses them for non-sponsored programs, such as children's programmes. The 1990s bumper style, however, is sometimes used sparingly.

Since 2003, nearly all of [[Astro (satellite TV)|Astro]]'s [[satellite television]] channels feature break bumpers that are placed before and after breaks. These bumpers consist of the logo of the aforementioned channels, as well as a slide promoting the current programme being broadcast and the next programme scheduled to air. Bumpers based on the subscription information sequence seen at the end of [[Astro Box Office]] promotional trailers from 2003 to 2006, appear in-between commercials and immediately before the program break ends, but not at the beginning of the block of replaced commercials.

== In other countries ==
In Argentina, since around September 2010, it is compulsory for almost all broadcasters to use a commercial bumper, using the words "Espacio publicitario" (Commercial break) to separate the rest of the programme from the advertisements.

In Poland, television networks usually separate the rest of the programming with the word "Reklama" ("Commercial").

In Russia, networks like Channel One and Russia 1 use the commercial bumpers as they appear as a one-off bumper. Channel One used the commercial idents as sting thru November 2004 to 31 August 2011 , As they started to use the short-lived commercial ident package called "The Four Seasons" which ran thru 1 September 2011 to 31 August 2012 , In these commercial idents the music was actually mostly classical with piano and violins, As they started to use the current commercial ident package "Clocks" which featured three separate piano pieces "Morning" (September 2012 to September 2013) and the popular "Noon" (which is the one that is the current piano piece should be used to this day) and "Night" (which they have started to use in 2016) they also used the 3-note piece as their three commercial idents debuted in 2012 and used the 3-note piece. In the international versions of these idents, They have used the information about to suggest an commercial. But networks like NTV use the commercial idents as an intro and outro idents. One of the famous commercial ident from NTV is the "Rectangle on the NTV" which has been used as an ident thru 6 September 1998 to 31 May 2001. Which in these idents feature the NTV logo being in an rectangle-shaped scope. At the beginning of each idents, the reminiscent of the commercial idents from 1996 or 1994. In the end of the commercials, flag and a part of the ident is shown. Another one is the short-lived one used from 1 June to 8 September 2001. Which in these commercial idents show the metal soviet pieces from 1980s and 1990s. Basically new year idents of Channel One are always festive. starting with 1995 when the famous things of Christmas should be shown like Santa Claus and Christmas Tree and especially Spasskaya Tower. 1996 shouldn't have a festive offering but logo is in snow. Starting with 1997, new year commercial idents are born. First of them would be the one with a snowman doing something weird. These commercial idents are ran from 24 December 1997 to 11 January 1998. Some of the most memorable new year commercial idents from Channel One we're the 2008 one. which features a Christmas tree with cards being animated. This one was ran thru 22 December 2008 to 11 January 2009 and returned in 21 December 2009 to 10 January 2010. Which the 2010 one had an inspiration from [[A Trip to the Moon]] featured an rocket's adventures in Moscow. For some reason the commercial idents did not have the word "реклама" when it was uploaded to Vimeo. Actually in the TV version did have the word "реклама". This ran from 20 December 2010 to 10 January 2011. But the Channel One had brought back the 2008 one in December 2011, Only difference is that the scope is now in 16:9. And the 2008 ident had being repeated in 2012 and 2013.

==Bumpers on children's television==
{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}
'''Bumpers''' or '''external eyecatches''' on children's television networks, and sometimes other networks are similar to the [[Eyecatch|internal eyecatches]] used in Japanese anime, with the difference being that the bumpers are supplied by the network. These usually appear only at the end of commercial breaks, but sometimes leading into the start of the break as well. Their primary purpose is to alert children that the commercial break has ended. Depending on the network, the bumper may or may not feature a [[voice over]].&lt;ref name="Example"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OxV-06DPpE An example of Children's TV Network bumpers (old bumpers from YTV)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Example 2"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1OSyNYuwzY Another example of Children's TV Network bumpers (old bumpers from Cartoon Network)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, these eyecatches have a secondary purpose: [[marketing]]. [[Canada|Canadian]] network [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]], for example, uses them to help children learn to identify the network and thus increase [[brand awareness]]. Most children's television networks run these bumpers because of this reason. From the mid-1980s to the early 1990s periods, [[Nickelodeon]] in conjunction with branding firm [[Fred Seibert|Fred]]/[[Alan Goodman|Alan, Inc.]] created 225 bumpers, some featuring catchy doo-wop jingles recorded by [[A cappella|a cappella]] group [[The Jive Five]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1301">The '''called party''' (in some contexts called the "B-Number") is a person who (or device that) answers a [[telephone call]]. The person who (or device that) initiates a telephone call is the [[calling party]].

In some situations, the called party may number more than one: such an instance is known as a [[conference call]]. Strictly, in some systems, only one called party is contacted at each event, as to initiate a conference call the calling party contacts the first called party, then this person contacts the second called party, but [[Sound|audio]] is transferred to both called parties.

In a [[collect call]] (i.e. reverse charge), the called party pays the fee for the call, when it is usually the calling party that does so. The called party also pays if the number dialed is a [[toll-free telephone number]].

In some countries such as Canada, the United States and China, users of [[mobile phone]]s pay for the "airtime" to receive calls. In most other countries (e.g. most European countries), the elevated [[Interconnect agreement|interconnect]] fees are paid fully by the [[calling party]] and the called party incurs no charge.

==Writing==

=== Style ===
Bakshi prepared only one draft for his writings. His language was a mix-up of Gujarati and Urdu words. His novels and stories had impact of [[existentialism]], his characters are suffering and frustrated yet surviving. ''Ekra'' (1963) is one such example.  In his novels, the story was a chief element. He rejected social and literary taboos in his novels but his works were concerned for readers. He freely borrowed words and phrases from Hindi, Urdu and English in his works.&lt;ref name="George1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=K. M. George|title=Modern Indian Literature, an Anthology: Surveys and poems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1R2Pa3f7r0C&amp;pg=PA141|year=1992|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-7201-324-0|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote historical fiction like ''Atitvan'' and ''Ayanvritta''. His short stories have themes like complexities of urban life, emotional outbursts, and the atmosphere of war. He wrote extensively on history and culture. According to ''Rediff'', his writing was 'sharp and brutal' when he criticised people he disliked. His biography ''Bakshinama'' was partially published in serialised form in Gujarati daily ''Samkalin''. Some parts were not published due to its violent imagery like urinating on the dead body of his enemy.&lt;ref name="red" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cb" /&gt;

===Works===

He is best known for his sixth novel પેરૅલિસિસ (Paralysis) published in 1967, which revolves around protagonist Professor Shah who becomes paralyzed and reminisces about his past life events in hospital. The novel is translated in [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[English language|English]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Another well known non-fiction books he authored is મહાજાતિ ગુજરાતી (Gujarati - A great race), a book on the traditions, characteristics and behavior of the various castes of Gujarat.

He authored 178 books, including 17 books on history and culture, 26 novels, 15 collections of [[short story|short stories]], six books on politics, eight [[Travel literature|travelogues]], two plays and 25 books on varied subjects, besides his autobiography ''Bakshinama''.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cb" /&gt;

'''Cheke Holo''' (also called Maringe or Mari''n''e, A’ara, Holo, Kubonitu) is an Oceanic language spoken in the [[Solomon Islands]]. Its speakers live on [[Santa Isabel Island]].

== Phonology ==
The [[phonology]] of Cheke Holo shows some peculiarities, shared with other Santa Isabel languages, like the aspirated stops and the voiceless sonorants. The five-vowel system instead conforms to the prototypical system of the Oceanic area {{harvcol|White|Kokhonigita|Pulomana|1988}}.

==Background==
Malaysia is home to approximately 7.2 million [[Malaysian Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] (23% of the population). The use of the Chinese language is preserved through Chinese vernacular education. Many [[varieties of Chinese]] are also used.

Malaysian Chinese have the option of sending their children to [[Education in Malaysia#Primary education|vernacular public schools]] which use Chinese as the medium of instruction at the primary level. At secondary level, some students opt for [[Chinese Independent High School]]s, instead of national public schools, which use [[Malay language|Malay]] as the medium of instruction. 

Malaysia also has a robust Chinese-language media. The ''[[Sin Chew Daily]]'' is the highest-circulated daily newspaper of any language in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The ABC Report: Circulation Figures for the period ending 30 June 2010 |url=http://abcm.org.my/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ABC-Jun2010.pdf |publisher=Audit Bureau of Circulations Malaysia |accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; News telecasts read in Chinese are broadcast by state television stations [[TV2 (Malaysia)|TV2]] and [[Bernama TV]], and private stations such as [[ntv7]] and [[8TV (Malaysia)|8TV]].

The [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese script]] is used in Malaysia.

==History==
In 1997, Malaysia hosted the Seminar on Chinese Language Teaching in Southeast Asia, after which scholars in Malaysia agreed to form the Chinese Language Standardisation Working Committee ({{zh|s=马来西亚华语规范工委会}}), which was the predecessor to Yufan. The Working Committee consisted of representatives from civil society organisations. It was dissolved in 2003.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; 

In order to standardise the use of Chinese by the Chinese media in Malaysia, the Ministry of Information formed the Standardisation Council on 12 February 2004.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; 

==Role==
The Council's stated mission is to "encourage the use of standard Chinese, including translated names, phonetics, grammar, words and text, without discouraging the use of [[Varieties of Chinese|dialects]]".&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; It consists of six divisions, each in charge of specific areas: translation, information, phonetics, grammar, vocabulary and writing, and publishing.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

===Membership===
Members of the Council consist of representatives from the Ministry of Education, the Association of Translation and Creative Writing, the Federation of Chinese Associations (Huazhong), the private Chinese education sector, the Home Ministry, Chinese newspapers, Chinese radio stations and public universities.&lt;ref name="members"&gt;{{cite web |title=2010-2013年理事会委员阵容 |url=http://www.yufan.net.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=2 |publisher=Yufan |language=Chinese |accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chair===
The following is the list of Chairmen of the Standardisation Council since 2004:&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;
#[[Donald Lim Siang Chai]], as Deputy Information Minister (2004–2006)
#[[Hon Choon Kim]], as Deputy Education Minister (2006–2009)

'''Condonation''', or '''condonance''' may be made when an accuser has previously forgiven or ''condoned'' (in some way or at some level supported) the act about which they are complaining. In some legal jurisdictions, and for certain behaviors, it may prevent the accuser from prevailing.

==Civil law==
For example, if a creditor states that they forgive a certain debt, they might be blocked (or [[estoppel|estopped]]) from attempting to collect that debt later. They would not be blocked from collecting any ''other'' debts, however.
Condonation may also be a defense in cases of dismissal from employment for cause where the employer by word or conduct forgives or impliedly forgives behavior which would otherwise justify dismissal without notice.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

On the other hand, condonation is irrelevant to some acts. For example, some jurisdictions prohibit fighting by consent (other than in specially-sanctioned sports, such as boxing). In such a jurisdiction, people arrested for brawling cannot avoid prosecution by condoning one another's assaults.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Military law==
The principle of condonation in military law is traced back to the "Memorandum on Corporal Punishment" issued by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] on 4 March 1832:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/despatchescorre00wellgoog#page/n271/mode/1up|title=Despatches, correspondence, and memoranda of Field Marshal Arthur, duke of Wellington|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"The performance of a duty of honour or of trust, after the knowledge of an offence committed by a soldier, ought to convey a pardon for the offence."}}

==Divorce law==
Prior to the advent of [[no-fault divorce]] statutes, condonation was frequently asserted as a defense to divorce.  Although one spouse may have committed an act that justified the other in obtaining a divorce, the other spouse might be deemed to have forgiven the conduct and thus waived the right to sue for divorce.  The most typical way in which condonation occurred is if the wronged spouse, with knowledge of the act, voluntarily engaged in sexual relations with the wrongdoer.  Critics of the doctrine contended that it discouraged spouses from attempting reconciliation, as one act of sexual intercourse would deprive the wronged spouse of any relief if the spouses were unable to resolve their differences.

==Honor killings==
The principle of condonation or near-equivalents can shield those who commit [[honor killing]]s from punishment:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/world/qandeel-baloch-brother-admits-murder-1.3682774 "Brother of slain Pakistani model Qandeel Baloch confesses to her murder"] ''Associated Press'', July 17, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|"Nearly 1,000 women are murdered in [[Pakistan]] each year for violating conservative norms on love and marriage. The so-called "honour killings" are often carried out by family members. Such killings are considered murder. But [[Islamic law|Sharia]] in Pakistan allows a murder victim's family to pardon the killer, which often allows those convicted of honour killings to escape punishment."}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4660">'''Cooptation''' is a cognitive-communicative operation whereby a piece of text, such as a clause, a phrase, a word, or any other unit, is inserted in a sentence. In the framework of [[Discourse grammar|Discourse Grammar]], cooptation is understood as leading to the transfer of linguistic material from the domain of [[Sentence Grammar]] to that of [[Thetical Grammar]].&lt;ref name=KHK2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HKKL2013 /&gt;

==An example==
The operation of cooptation can be illustrated with the following utterance taken from the British component of the ''International Corpus of English'':.&lt;ref name=NWA2002 /&gt; 
*''What I’ve done here '''I hope you don’t entirely disapprove''' is try and limit the time taken on this item by putting it in writing.'' (ICE-GB: s1b-075-180) 
In this example, the utterance is obviously composed of two pieces: On the one hand, there is the well-formed and self-contained sentence ''What I’ve done here is try and limit the time taken on this item by putting it in writing'', which provides the host construction. On the other hand, there is the piece ''I hope you don’t entirely disapprove'', which is inserted in the host construction but neither syntactically nor semantically, nor prosodically integrated in the host construction, and rather than contributing to the meaning of the sentence, it relates to the situation of discourse. Such inserts are commonly known as [[parentheticals]] or [[extra-clausal constituent]]s.&lt;ref name=DK2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=D1997 /&gt; In the framework of Discourse Grammar they are referred to as ''theticals'', and cooptation is the operation that enables speakers to transfer them from one domain of grammar to the other, and to place them in various slots of the host construction.&lt;ref name=KHK2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=H2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HKKfc /&gt;

==Principles and concepts==
Sentence Grammar is organized in terms of propositional concepts and clauses and their combination while Thetical Grammar concerns the linguistic discourse beyond the sentence. While being in principle separate domains, the two interact in various ways in organizing linguistic discourse, and the main way of interaction is via cooptation.&lt;ref name=KH2014 /&gt; Cooptation is fully productive, that is, it can be employed by speakers any time to structure speech. As long as the hearer can be expected to construct a reasonable hypothesis on the relevance of the coopted unit to the utterance concerned there are few restrictions on what form the coopted unit may take and where it can be placed in its	 host construction.&lt;ref name=KD2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=D2014 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3231">The Rev. Canon '''Cosslett Quinn''', in Irish '''Cosslett Ó Cuinn''' ([[Derriaghy]], [[County Antrim]], 27 February 1907 - 6 December 1995) was a priest of the [[Church of Ireland]] who translated the [[New Testament]] into [[Irish language|Irish]].&lt;ref&gt;"Bible" in ''The Oxford Companion to Irish Literature'' ed. Robert Welch, Bruce Stewart; p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Quinn was born to Charles Edward Quinn, [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of Derriaghy, and Edith Isobel Wadell. He studied at [[Campbell College]], [[Belfast]], and later at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College Dublin]], where he received his [[Bachelor of Divinity]] in [[Theology]] in 1940.

Quinn was a poet, theologian, critic, biblical scholar, member of the [[ecumenical movement]], and a scholar of the Irish language. During his studies, he developed a strong interest in [[Ulster Irish]], and often visited the Irish-speaking [[Gola Island]] and [[Derrybeg]]. He also published articles in ''[[Éigse|Éigse: A Journal of Irish Studies]]'' on the dialects of Irish spoken on [[Rathlin Island]] and [[County Kilkenny|Kilkenny]]. Quinn compiled the folklore of native Irish speakers from the islands of [[Tory Island|Tory]] and [[Arranmore]] off the coast of [[County Donegal]].

While working in Belfast and [[Inishowen]] in 1931, Quinn was promoted to the post of [[deacon]]. In 1961, he was appointed professor of Biblical Greek at Trinity College, and began work on a new translation of the New Testament. He also translated the Book of Psalms and the Prayer Book of the Church of Ireland into Irish, as well as several Spanish works. Although it was unusual in his lifetime for Protestants to hold leading positions in the Irish language movement, Quinn was for a time President of [[Oireachtas na Gaeilge]].&lt;ref&gt;Réamonn Ó Ciaráin et al. (1997), ''Aspects of a Shared Heritage'', Dublin &amp; Armagh: [[Gael Linn]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was made a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of St Patrick's Cathedral in 1966, before retiring from the ministry in 1971.

'''Defeasance''' (or '''defeazance''') ({{lang-fr|défaire}}, to undo), in law, an [[Legal instrument|instrument]] which defeats the force or operation of some other [[deed]] or [[Estate (law)|estate]]; as distinguished from ''condition'', that which in the same deed is called a condition is a defeasance in another deed.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Defeasance|volume=7|page=925}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in several contexts in finance, including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/barrons_dictionary/dictionary-defeasance-4952691-1.html defeasance] AllBusiness.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

*  a clause in a [[mortgage]] granting a borrower exclusive ownership in a property after a debt is repaid, 
* a [[corporate finance]] technique where a corporate bond issue is repaid through an  [[irrevocable trust]], which allows the corporation to remove liabilities from its balance sheet; notably used by [[Exxon]] in 1982

A defeasance should recite the deed to be defeated and its date, and it must be made between the same [[party (law)|parties]] as are interested in the deed to which it is [[Collateral contract|collateral]]. It must be of a thing defensible, and all the conditions must be strictly carried out before the defeasance can be consummated. Defeasance in a [[bill of sale]] is the putting an end to the [[Security interest|security]] by realizing the goods for the benefit of the [[Mortgage law#Participants and variant terminology|mortgagee]]. It is not strictly a defeasance, because the stipulation is in the same deed; it is really a condition in the nature of a defeasance.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[File:B?thincourt Sturmtruppen (16100661257).jpg|thumb|{{center|Bethincourt: ''Sturmtruppen'' (16100661257)}}]]
'''''Eingreif'' division''' is a term for a type of [[German Empire|German]] [[German Army (German Empire)|Army]] formation of [[World War I]], which developed in 1917, which was responsible for engaging in immediate [[counterattack|counter-attacks]] [[Glossary of German military terms|(''Gegenstoße'')]] against enemy troops who broke through a defensive position being held by a front-holding division ({{lang|de|Stellungsdivision}}). Attacks by the French and British armies against the ''Westheer'' on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] had been met in 1915 and 1916 by increasing the number and sophistication of trench networks, the original improvised defences of 1914 giving way to a centrally-planned system of trenches in a trench-position and then increasing numbers of trench-positions, to absorb the growing firepower and offensive sophistication of the Entente armies.

During the [[Battle of the Somme]] (1 July – 18 November 1916), the use of defensive lines began to evolve into the defence of the areas between them, using the local troops of the trench holding divisions and  {{lang|de|Ablösungsdivisionen}} (relief divisions), held back beyond the range of Franco-British artillery, to replace front line divisions as they became exhausted. In the winter of 1916–1917, the use of such divisions and the fortified zones between trench lines was codified and divisions trained in the new defensive tactics. Training was based on the experience of the defensive battles of 1916 and the new principles of fortification, to provide the infrastructure for the new system of defensive battle by {{lang|de|Stellungsdivisionen}} and {{lang|de|Eingreifdivisionen}} (counter-attack divisions).

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R05944, Champagne, deutsche Sturmtruppen.jpg|thumb|{{center|Stormtroops, Champagne, France}}]]
The new defensive principles and fortifications were used in 1917 to resist the Franco-British offensives. After failures at Verdun in December 1916 and at Arras in April 1917, the system of fortifications defended by ''Stellungsdivisionen'' supported by ''Eingreif'' divisions counter-attacking from the rear was vindicated during the French attacks of the [[Nivelle Offensive]]. The continuation of British attacks at Arras in the wake of the French debacle on the Aisne, led to the highest rate of casualties per day of the war but the system failed again at the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]]. German defensive tactics reached their ultimate refinement during the [[Third Battle of Ypres]] and there were only slight alterations during the defensive battles of late 1918. In the interwar period, German defensive thinking incorporated the new technology of aircraft, tanks, anti-aircraft guns and anti-tank guns in a much deeper defensive system filled with positions for delaying actions, before a counter-attack was made by armoured and mechanised formations.

==German defensive tactics==

===1914–1916===
[[File:Western front 1915-16.jpg|thumb|{{center|Map of the Western Front, 1915–1916}}]]
German defensive tactics had been based on the publication {{lang|de|Exerzier-Reglement für die Infanterie}} of 1906 (Drill Regulations for the Infantry), which expected defensive warfare to be short periods between offensives. On the Somme front, the construction plan ordered by Falkenhayn in January 1915 had been completed. Barbed wire obstacles had been enlarged from one belt {{convert|5|–|10|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide to two, {{convert|30|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide and about {{convert|15|yd|m|abbr=on}} apart. Double and triple thickness wire was used and laid {{convert|3|–|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} high. The front line had been increased from one line to three, {{convert|150|–|200|yd|m|abbr=on}} apart, the first trench ({{lang|de|Kampfgraben}}, "battle trench") occupied by sentry groups, the second ({{lang|de|Wohngraben}}, "living trench") for the front-trench garrison and the third trench for local reserves. The trenches were traversed and had sentry-posts in concrete recesses built into the parapet. Dug-outs had been deepened from {{convert|6|–|9|ft|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|20|–|30|ft|m|abbr=on}}, {{convert|50|yd|m|abbr=on}} apart and large enough for {{nowrap|25 men.}} An intermediate line of strong points ({{lang|de|Stützpunktlinie}}) about {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} behind the front line had also been built.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=100–101}}

Communication trenches ran back to the reserve line, renamed the second line, which was as well-built and wired as the first line. The second line was built beyond the range of Allied field artillery, to force an attacker to stop and move field artillery forward before assaulting the line.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=100–101}} After the {{lang|de|Herbstschlacht}} (Autumn Battle) in Champagne during late 1915, a third line another {{convert|3000|yd|m|abbr=on}} back from the {{lang|de|Stützpunktlinie}} was begun in February 1916 and was nearly complete when the Battle of the Somme began.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=100–101}} German artillery was organised in a series of {{lang|de|Sperrfeuerstreifen}} (barrage sectors). The Somme defences were crowded towards the front trench, with a regiment having two battalions near the front trench system and the reserve battalion divided between the {{lang|de|Stützpunktlinie}} and the second line, all within {{convert|2000|yd|m|abbr=on}} of the front line.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=100–103}}

After the [[Battle of the Somme]] (1 July – 18 November), [[General of the Infantry (Germany)|General]] [[Erich Ludendorff]] had German defensive doctrine revised.{{sfn|Samuels|2003|p=179}} On 1 December, the ''[[Oberste Heeresleitung]]'' (''OHL'', supreme army command) published new tactical instructions, {{lang|de|Grundsätze für die Führung in der Abwehrschlacht im Stellungskrieg}} (Principles of Command for Defensive Battle in Positional Warfare), in which the policy of unyielding defence of ground regardless of its tactical value, was replaced.{{efn|Ludendorff credited Colonel [[Max Bauer]] and Captain [[Hermann Geyer]] with authorship and in 1995, Lupfer wrote that it was a collective effort of the General Staff, including Colonel Max Bauer, Major Georg Wetzell and Captain Hermann Geyer.{{sfn|Ludendorff|2005|p=458}}{{sfn|Lupfer|1981|p=45}}}} Positions suitable for artillery observation and communication with the rear were to be defended, where an attacking force would "fight itself to a standstill and use up its resources while the defenders conserve[d] their strength". Defending infantry would fight in areas, with the front divisions in an outpost zone up to {{convert|3000|yd|m|abbr=on}} deep behind listening posts, with the main line of resistance placed on a reverse slope, in front of artillery observation posts kept far enough back to retain observation over the outpost zone. Behind the main line of resistance was a {{lang|de|Grosskampfzone}} (main battle zone), a second defensive area {{convert|1500|–|2500|yd|m|abbr=on}} deep, also sited as far as possible on ground hidden from enemy observation, while in view of German artillery observers was to be built.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=149–151}} A {{lang|de|rückwärtige Kampfzone}} (rear battle zone) further back was to be occupied by the reserve battalion of each regiment.{{sfn|Samuels|2003|p=181}}

====Somme analysis====
{{see also|Battle of the Somme}}

''Erfahrungen der I Armee in der Sommeschlacht'' (Experience of the German 1st Army in the Somme Battles), written by Colonel [[Fritz von Loßberg]], Chief of Staff of the [[1st Army (German Empire)|1st Army]] was published on 30 January 1917. During the Battle of the Somme, Loßberg had been able to establish a line of  {{lang|de|Ablösungsdivisionen}} (relief divisions), with the reinforcements from Verdun, which had arrived in greater numbers in September 1916. In his analysis, Loßberg opposed the granting of discretion to front trench garrisons to retire, as he believed that manoeuvre did not allow the garrisons to evade Allied artillery fire, which could blanket the forward area and would invite opposing infantry to occupy vacant areas. Loßberg considered that spontaneous withdrawals would disrupt the counter-attack reserves as they deployed and further deprive battalion and division commanders of the means to conduct an organised defence, which the dispersal of infantry over a wider area had already made difficult. Loßberg and other officers had severe doubts as to the ability of relief divisions to arrive on the battlefield in time to conduct a {{lang|de|Gegenstoss}} from behind the battle zone. The sceptics wanted the Somme practice of fighting in the front line to be retained and authority devolved no further than the battalion to maintain control, ready for a  {{lang|de|Gegenangriff}} (organised counter-attack) after {{nowrap|24–48 hours,}} by the relief divisions. Ludendorff added the analysis to the new {{lang|de|Grundsätze für die Führung in der Abwehrschlacht im Stellungskrieg}}.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|p=161}}

====Field fortification====
{{see also|Hindenburg Line}}

[[File:Hindenberg line bullecourt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|{{center|The Hindenburg Line at [[Bullecourt]], 1920}}]]
{{lang|de|Allgemeines über Stellungsbau}} (Principles of Field Fortification) was published in January 1917 on which new defensive fortifications were to be based, to provide the infrastructure for the new defensive tactics. By April an outpost zone ({{lang|de|Vorpostenfeld}}) held by sentries, had been built along the Western Front. Sentries could retreat to larger positions ({{lang|de|Gruppennester}}) held by {{lang|de|Stosstrupps}} (five men and an NCO per {{lang|de|Trupp}}), who would join the sentries to recapture sentry-posts by immediate counter-attack. Defensive procedures in the battle zone were similar but with greater numbers. The front trench system was the sentry line for the battle zone garrison, which was allowed to move away from concentrations of enemy fire and then counter-attack to recover the battle and outpost zones; such withdrawals were envisaged as occurring on small parts of the battlefield, which had been made untenable by Allied artillery fire, as the prelude to {{lang|de|Gegenstoss in der Stellung}} (immediate counter-attack within the position). Such a decentralised battle by large numbers of small infantry detachments would present the attacker with unforeseen obstructions. The further the penetration, the greater the density of defenders, equipped with automatic weapons, camouflaged and supported by observed artillery fire. A school was opened in January 1917 to teach infantry commanders the new methods.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=152–156}}

===''Eingreifdivision''===

{{see also|Stormtrooper}}

[[File:Battle of Arras, April 1917.PNG|thumb|{{center|Battle of Arras, April 1917.}}]]
''Eingreif'' is generally translated as ''counter-attack'' but the term had other connotations.{{sfn|Samuels|2003|p=183}} In German [[military doctrine|military thinking]], it included a sense of intervening and is better understood as ''interlocking'' or ''dovetailing'', in which the ''Eingreifdivision'' came under the command of the ''Stellungsdivision'' and joined with the defensive garrison and its fortifications.{{sfn|Samuels|2003|p=183}} The term was adopted during the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] (9 April – 16 May 1917) to replace {{lang|de|Ablösungsdivision}} (relief division), to end confusion over the purpose of divisions held in readiness. There were also calls for each ''Stellungsdivision'' to have the support of an ''Eingreifdivision'' but Ludendorff could not find sufficient divisions for this.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=184–185}} [[James Edward Edmonds|J. E. Edmonds]], the British official historian, called the divisions ''special reserve'' or ''super counter-attack'' divisions.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=143}} Such methods required large numbers of reserve divisions, ready to counter-attack, which were obtained by creating {{nowrap|22 new}} divisions, moving some divisions from the eastern front and [[Alberich (World War I German operation)|Operation Alberich]] (''Unternehmen Alberich'') in March 1917, which shortened the front. By the spring, the German army in the west had accumulated a strategic reserve of {{nowrap|40 divisions.}} Over the winter, certain divisions were trained as ''Eingreifdivisionen'' but a strict distinction between these divisions and the remaining ''Stellungsdivisionen'' could not always be maintained.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=156–158}}

The new system reflected the views of [[Carl von Clausewitz]] {{nowrap|(1 June 1780 – 16 November 1831)}} that defensive battle should not be passive but one of deflection and attack (''eine Verbindung von Parade und Stoss''), with the ''Eingreif'' divisions providing a "flashing sword of retaliation" (''das blitzende Vergeltungsschwert'').{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=157–158}} On 1 January 1917, General [[Otto von Moser]] was appointed to lead a new ''Divisionskommandeur Schule'' at [[Solesmes, Nord|Solesmes]] near the Belgian border, to teach the new defensive thinking with a training ground and a Testing and Instructional Division at full establishment for demonstrations. The first course from {{nowrap|8–16 February}} was attended by about {{nowrap|100 officers}} of the ''Westheer'' who attended morning lectures and afternoon exercises and a second course run from {{nowrap|20–28 February}} was also attended by some officers from the Eastern Front and three Austro-Hungarian army observers. The third course from {{nowrap|4–12 March}} included officers from other armies of the [[Central Powers]] and then Moser took over command of the [[XIV Reserve Corps (German Empire)|XIV Reserve Corps]]. Many of the students accepted the new defensive thinking but Loßberg and other dissenters objected to discretion to retreat being given to the front garrison and a second school was set up at Sedan for the officers of [[Army Group German Crown Prince|''Heeresgruppe Deutscher Kronprinz'']].{{sfn|Samuels|2003|pp=184–186}}{{sfn|Wynne|1976|p=162}}  During the British preparatory bombardment of Messines Ridge before the attack on 7 June, the 24th Division was relieved by the 35th Division and the 40th Division by the 3rd Bavarian Division, the local ''Eingreif'' divisions and these were replaced by the 7th Division and the 1st Guard Reserve Division, unfamiliar with the area and not trained ''Eingreifdivisionen''.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=269–270}} Some were retained as they were rebuilt after spending time in the line; the 24th Division was given six weeks' rest and reconstituted as the ''Eingreifdivision'' of Group Aubers before returning to Flanders on 11 August. The 23rd Reserve Division acted as a ''Stellungsdivision'' from 23 June to 29 July, spent August recuperating and September as an ''Eingreifdivision'' for Group Dixmude, before being rushed to Group Ypres on 20 September to relieve the 2nd Guard Division.{{sfn|Lucas|Schmieschek|2015|pp=132, 146–148}}

====Training====

When the [[183rd Infantry Division (German Empire)|183rd Division]] arrived in Flanders became an ''Eingreifdivisionen'' for ''Gruppe Ypren''. The divisional artillery had been reorganised, with the medium and heavy guns participating in conventional artillery bombardments and the three battalions of Field Artillery Regiment 183 being divided between the three infantry regiments. Each infantry regiment received two assault batteries and a platoon of Reserve Engineer Battalion 16, to provide observed and direct fire. Training in the new role led to infantry companies being reorganised and new specialisms being introduced. The three platoons in each company became a rifle section, an assault group, a grenade-launcher troop and a light machine-gun section. The use of hand grenades became more important and coloured flares were used as the quickest way to signal to the rear.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|pp=99–100}}

====Defensive tactics====
The German army distinguished between a hasty counter-attack ({{lang|de|Gegenstoss}}) to prevent an opponent from consolidating captured positions and an organised counter-attack ({{lang|de|Gegenangriff}}), which took place after a period for reconnaissance, reinforcement and preliminary artillery fire.{{sfn|Zabecki|2004|p=67}} The new tactics required commanders to act on their initiative and troops to perform complicated manoeuvres in battle, which could only be implemented through a comprehensive training programme to make it possible.{{sfn|Samuels|2003|pp=196–197}} ''Eingreif'' divisions were to wait in readiness at the rear of the defensive zone to join the more immediate {{lang|de|Gegenstoss}} engagements, if troops held in reserve by the {{lang|de|Stellungsdivision}} were insufficient to restore the position.{{sfn|Balck|2010|p=160}} With the increasing Allied superiority in munitions and manpower, attackers might still penetrate to the second (artillery protection) line, leaving German garrisons isolated in {{lang|de|Widerstandsnester}} (''Widas'', resistance nests), still inflicting losses and disorganisation on the attackers. As the attackers tried to capture the {{lang|de|Widas}} and dig in near the German second line, {{lang|de|Sturmbattalions}} and {{lang|de|Sturmregimenter}} of the ''Eingreif'' divisions would advance from the {{lang|de|rückwärtige Kampfzone}} into the battle zone, in an immediate counter-attack ({{lang|de|Gegenstoss aus der Tiefe}}). If the immediate counter-attack failed, the ''Eingreif'' divisions would take {{nowrap|24–48 hours}} to prepare a {{lang|de|Gegenangriff}} (organised counter-attack), if the lost ground was essential for the retention of the main position.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=156–158}}

===Third Battle of Ypres===

====31 July====

The British advance in the centre of the front had caused serious concern to the German commanders.{{sfn|Harris|2008|p=366}} Penetration of the defensive system was expected but the {{convert|4000|yd|m|abbr=on}} advance in the centre of the attack had not been anticipated. At noon, the British advance on the Gheluvelt Plateau to the south had been stopped by the local German defenders and their artillery. In the centre, regiments of the 221st and 50th Reserve Divisions, the ''Eingreif'' divisions at the rear of the Group Ypres defensive zone, advanced over the Broodseinde–Passchendaele ridge, unseen by British reconnaissance aircraft.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=169}} The ''Eingreif'' regiments began their advance from {{nowrap|11:00–11:30 a.m.}} and the German artillery began a creeping barrage at {{nowrap|2:00 p.m.}} along the centre of the British front. The ''Eingreif'' regiments drove back the three most advanced British brigades, inflicting {{nowrap|70 percent}} casualties, recaptured the Zonnebeke–Langemarck road and St Julien, before the advance was stopped on the black line (second objective) by mud, the British artillery and machine-gun fire.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|loc=sketch 13}}{{sfn|Terraine|1977|pp=94–95}}{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=173–174}} The ''Eingreif'' divisions had little success on the northern flank of the Anglo-French attack, where the attackers had time to dig in. After losing many men to British artillery-fire while advancing around Langemarck, the Germans managed to push back a small British bridgehead on the east bank of the Steenbeek; the French repulsed the Germans around St Janshoek and followed up to capture Bixschoote.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=174}} Counter-attacks in the afternoon by the ''Stellungsdivisionen'' on the southern flank, intended to recapture Westhoek Ridge, were able to advance a short distance from Glencorse Wood before British artillery-fire and a counter-attack pushed them back again.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=176–177}}{{efn|In the Second Army area south of the plateau at La Basse Ville, a powerful attack at {{nowrap|3:30 p.m.}} was repulsed by the [[New Zealand Division]]. X Corps also managed to hold its gains around Klein Zillibeke against a big German attack at {{nowrap|7:00 p.m.}}{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=176–177}}}}

====22 September====

[[File:German defensive system, Flanders, mid-1917.jpg|thumb|{{center|German defensive system, Flanders, mid-1917}}]]
The leading regiment of an ''Eingreif'' division was to advance into the zone of the front division, with its other two regiments moving forward in close support. The support and reserve assembly areas in the ''Flandern Stellung'' were termed ''Fredericus Rex Raum'' and ''Triarier Raum'', an analogy with the structure of a Roman legion. ''Eingreif'' divisions were accommodated {{convert|10000|–|12000|yd|m|abbr=on}} behind the front line and began their advance to their assembly areas in the rear zone ({{lang|de|rückwärtige Kampffeld}}), ready to intervene in the main battle zone ({{lang|de|Grosskampffeld}}).{{sfn|Wynne|1976|p=290}} After the defeat of [[Menin Road Ridge]], the German defensive deployment was changed. In August, German ''Stellungsdivisionen'' had two regiments of three battalions each forward, with the third regiment in reserve. The front battalions had needed to be relieved much more frequently than expected, due to constant British bombardments and the weather, which had caused units to become mixed up. Reserve regiments had not been able to intervene quickly, leaving front battalions unsupported until ''Eingreif'' divisions arrived, some hours after the commencement of the attack. The deployment was changed to increase the number of troops in the front zone. By 26 September all three regiments of the front-line division were forward, each holding an area {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|3000|yd|m|abbr=on}} deep; one battalion was placed in the front-line, the second in support and the third in close reserve.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|p=168}}

The battalions were to move forward successively, to engage fresh enemy battalions, which had leap-frogged through those that had delivered the first attack. The ''Eingreif'' divisions were to deliver an organised attack with artillery support later in the day, before the British could consolidate their new line.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|p=170}} The change was intended to remedy the neutralisation of the front division reserves, which had been achieved by the British artillery on 20 September, so that they could intervene before the ''Eingreif'' divisions arrived. On 22 September, new tactical requirements were laid down: more artillery counter-bombardment was to be used between British attacks, half against British artillery and half against infantry, increased raiding was ordered to induce the British to hold their positions in greater strength, giving German artillery a denser target; better artillery observation was demanded in the battle zone, to increase the accuracy of German artillery fire when British troops advanced into it and quicker counter-attacks were to be made.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=295}}

====30 September====
Following the costly defeats of Menin Road on 20 September and Polygon Wood on 26 September, the German commanders made more changes to the defensive organisation and altered their counter-attack tactics, which had been negated by the British combination of limited attack and much greater artillery firepower than August. ''Eingreif'' divisions had engaged in "an advance to contact during mobile operations" in August, which had achieved several costly defensive successes.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|p=184}} German counter-attacks in September had been "assaults on reinforced field positions", due to the short British infantry advances and emphasis on defeating {{lang|de|Gegenstosse}} ("instant-immediate counter-attacks"). The period of dry weather and clear skies which began in early September, had greatly increased the effectiveness of British air observation and artillery fire. German counter-attacks were defeated with heavy casualties, after arriving too late to take advantage of disorganisation. The British changes meant that a defence in depth had been swiftly established on reverse slopes, behind standing barrages, in dry, clear weather, with specialist air reconnaissance for observation of German troop movements and improved contact patrolling and ground-attack operations by the RFC. German artillery which was able to fire, despite British counter-battery shelling, became unsystematic due to uncertainty over the whereabouts of German infantry and British infantry benefitted from the opposite.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=294–295}} On 28 September [[Albrecht von Thaer]], Staff Officer at Group Wytschaete wrote that the experience was "awful" and that he did not know what to do.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|pp=45–58}}

Ludendorff later wrote that he had regularly discussed the situation with General [[Hermann von Kuhl]] and Loßberg, to try to find a remedy for the overwhelming British attacks.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|pp=278–279}} Ludendorff ordered a strengthening of the forward garrisons by the ground holding divisions and all machine-guns, including those of the support and reserve battalions of the front line regiments, were sent into the forward zone, to form a cordon of four to eight guns every {{convert|250|yd|m|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=307–308}} The {{lang|de|Stoss}} regiment of each ''Eingreif'' division, was placed behind each front division in the artillery protective line behind the forward battle zone, which increased the ratio of ''Eingreif'' divisions to {{lang|de|Stellungsdivisionen}} {{nowrap|to 1:1.}} The {{lang|de|Stoss}} regiment was to be available to launch counter-attacks while the British were consolidating; the remainder of each ''Eingreif'' division was to be withheld for a {{lang|de|Gegenangriff}} (methodical counter-attack) on the next day or the one after.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|p=307}} Between British attacks, the ''Eingreif'' divisions were to make more spoiling attacks.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|pp=190–191}}

A 4th Army operation order on 30 September pointed out that the German position in Flanders was restricted by the local topography, the proximity of the coast and the Dutch frontier, which made local withdrawals impossible. The instructions of 22 September were to be followed, with more bombardment by field artillery, using at least half of the heavy artillery ammunition, for observed fire on infantry positions in captured pillboxes, command posts, machine-gun nests, on duck board tracks and field railways. Gas bombardment was to be increased, on forward positions and artillery emplacements, when the wind allowed. Every effort was to be made to induce the British to reinforce their forward positions, where the German artillery could engage them, by making spoiling attacks to recapture pillboxes, improve defensive positions and harass the British infantry, with patrols and diversionary bombardments.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|pp=184–186}} From {{nowrap|26 September – 3 October,}} the Germans attacked and counter-attacked at least {{nowrap|24 times}}.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|p=278}} British intelligence predicted the German changes in an intelligence summary of 1 October, foreseeing the big German counter-attack planned for 4 October.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=318}}{{sfn|Freeman|2011|pp=70–71}}

====7–13 October====

[[File:Third Ypres - Map Showing Progress in the Ypres Area..jpg|thumb|{{center|Third Ypres, map showing the British advance}}]]
On 7 October, the 4th Army abandoned the reinforcement of the front defence zone, after the "black day" of 4 October. Front line regiments were dispersed again, with reserve battalions moved back behind the artillery protective line and ''Eingreif'' divisions organised to intervene as swiftly as possible, despite the risk of being devastated by the British artillery. Counter-battery fire against British artillery was to be increased to protect the ''Eingreif'' divisions as they advanced. Ludendorff insisted on an advanced zone, ({{lang|de|Vorfeld}}) {{convert|500|–|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} deep, to be occupied by a thin line of sentries with a few machine-guns. The sentries were to retire on the main line of resistance ({{lang|de|Hauptwiederstandslinie}}) at the back of this advanced zone when attacked, while the artillery was quickly to barrage the area in front of it. Support and reserve battalions of the front-line and ''Eingreif'' divisions, would gain time to move up to the main line of resistance, where the battle would be fought, if artillery-fire had not stopped the British infantry advance. An ''Eingreif'' division was to be placed behind each front-line division, with instructions to ensure that it reached the British before they could consolidate. If a swift counter-attack was not possible, there was to be a delay to organise a methodical counter-attack, after ample artillery preparation. Armin ordered on 11 October that the ''Stellungs-'' and ''Eingreif-'' divisions of groups Staden, Ypres and part of Group Wijtschate were to take turns in the front line, ''Eingreif'' becoming more of a role than an identity.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|pp=242, 270, 291}} The revised defensive scheme was promulgated on 13 October, over Rupprecht's objections.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|p=309}}

Artillery-fire was to replace the machine-gun defence of the forward zone as far as possible, which Rupprecht believed would allow the British artillery too much freedom to operate. The thin line of sentries of one or two {{lang|de|Gruppen}} (thirteen men and a light machine-gun each) in company sectors proved inadequate, as the British were easily able to attack them and lift prisoners.{{sfn|Bax|Boraston|2001|pp=162–163}} At the end of October, the sentry line was replaced by a conventional outpost system of double {{lang|de|Gruppen}}. The German defensive system had become based on two divisions, holding a front {{convert|2500|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|8000|yd|m|abbr=on}} deep, half the area that two divisions previously were expected to hold.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|p=310}} The necessity of such reinforcement was caused by the weather, devastating British artillery-fire and the decline in the numbers and quality of German infantry. Concealment ({{lang|de|die Leere des Gefechtsfeldes}}) was emphasised, to protect the divisions from British fire power, by avoiding anything resembling a trench system, in favour of dispersal in crater fields. Such a method was only made feasible by the rapid rotation of units; battalions of the front-divisions were relieved after two days and divisions every six days. On 23 October, the ''Stellungsdivision'' commander was given command of the ''Eingreifdivision'', creating a new two-division tactical unit. The quicker rotation of divisions led to the distinction between ''Eingreif'' divisions and ''Stellungsdivisions'', becoming tenuous and more one of the task rather than the division. In late November, Ludendorff ordered all of the armies on the Western Front to adopt the new system.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=311–315}}

===Cambrai, 1918 and post-war===

[[File:Karte westwall.png|thumb|{{center|Map of the ''Westwall'', 1939}}]]
German defensive battle tactics reached their culmination at the Third Battle of Ypres; the counter-offensive at Cambrai was a conventional ''Gegenangriff'' and in 1918, minor changes to nomenclature and the ''Vorfeld'' and ''Hauptwiederstandslinie'' system were made because of mechanisation within the army. The ''Vorpostenfeld'' (outpost zone) became the ''Kampffeld'' (advanced battle zone) at the front, with the ''Hauptkampffeld'' (main battle zone),  the ''Grosskampffeld'' (greater battle zone), the ''Rückwärtige Stellung'' (rear position) further back then the ''Rückwärtiges Kampffeld'' (rear battle zone). ''Eingreif'' divisions were based from {{convert|10000|–|12000|yd|m|abbr=on}} behind the front line and expected to fight the main defensive battle in the ''Grosskampffeld''. The ''Kampffeld'' was held with as few troops as possible, exploiting flanking fire from machine-guns and single field guns. The front line was along the forward edge of the ''Grosskampffeld'' and covered the field artillery positions supporting the troops in the ''Kapmpffeld''. Further back were positions for the counter-attack troops of the ''Stellungsdivision'', to provide time for the ''Eingreif'' divisions to close up and counter-attack along with the local reserves.{{sfn|Edmonds|Maxwell-Hyslop|1993|p=12}}

On 20 July 1918, Ludendorff sent Loßberg to report on the conditions in the Marne Salient, who found that the system devised for the operations in Flanders in 1917 was unworkable in the terrain of the Vesle and Aisne valleys. The unspoilt countryside was full of trees and standing crops; terrain dispersed defences were incapable of resisting tank attacks from the flanks and rear with so much cover for the attackers. Defences were changed back a line of observation groups in front of the main line of resistance, the groups having increased firepower, to force an attacker to deploy sooner. Delaying actions, moving back through lines of observation were developed into a holding action (''hinhaltendes gefecht'').{{sfn|Edmonds|Maxwell-Hyslop|1993|pp=12–13}} 

The relative success of the defensive system at Ypres in 1917 was not repeated in 1918 on the [[Santerre (region)|Santerre]] in [[Picardy]] or the downlands west of Cambrai. The ''Vorpostenfeld'' could be overrun behind creeping barrages at night or in twilight and there were too few ''Eingreif'' divisions to counter-attack, those present being capable only of local attacks or reinforcement of the defenders. German divisions were smaller than earlier in the war, had more machine-guns and better command arrangements but the system of linked ''Stellungsdivisionen'' and ''Eingreifdivisionen'' was most demanding of manpower; British attacks in late 1918 rarely outnumbered the defenders, relying on initiative and surprise.{{sfn|Edmonds|Maxwell-Hyslop|1993|pp=12–13}}

Writing in 1939, Wynne described contemporary German defensive principles that resembled the defence of Flanders in 1917, with the depth of the defensive position increased to about {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}}, filled with lines of resistance (''Sicherungs-Widerstandslinie'') from which to fight a delaying action. Static defences would be backed by mechanised and motorised ''Eingreif'' divisions ready to use speed, firepower and shock in a ''Gegenstoss auf der Tiefe'' (counter-attack from the rear). Inside the defensive position, anti-aircraft, anti-tank guns and mobile anti-tank guns would inflict losses on the opposing tanks and aircraft that were supporting the infantry attack but the fixed defences of the ''[[Siegfried Line]]'' were less important than the "flashing sword of retaliation".{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=322, 315, 324}}

'''Esmeralda–Yaruro''' or '''Takame–Jarúroan''', is a proposed connection between two unclassified languages of [[Venezuela]], [[Yaruro language|Yaruro]] (Llaruro, Pumé, Yuapín), 6000 speakers, and the extinct [[Esmeralda language|Esmeralda]] (Esmeraldeño, Takame). They would be only distantly related, but Kaufman (1990) finds the connection convincing, and Campbell &amp; Grondina (2012) believe it worth exploring.

{{main|Hawaiian language}}

This article summarizes [[grammar]] in the [[Hawaiian language]].

==Syntax==
Hawaiian is a predominantly [[verb–subject–object]] language. However, word order is flexible, and the emphatic word can be placed first in the sentence.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;{{rp|p28}}  Hawaiian largely avoids [[subordinate clause]]s,&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;{{rp|p.27}} and often uses a possessive construction instead.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;{{rp|p.41}}

Hawaiian, like English, is a non-[[pro-drop language]]. Nonetheless, there is an exception with commands, where the use of subject pronouns is optional. In these cases, the subject pronoun is seldom used if the context deems it unnecessary, as in ''e hele i ke kula'' "[imperfective] go to the school", "go to school"; here, the subject "you" is understood, and can be omitted.

The typical detailed word order is given by the following,&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt;{{rp|p.19}} with most items optional:

:(a) Tense/aspect signs: ''i'', ''ua'', ''e'', etc.
:(b) Verb
:(c) Qualifying adverb: ''mau'', ''wale'', ''ole'', ''pu'', etc.
:(d) Passive sign: '' 'ia''
:(e) Verbal directives: ''aku'', ''mai'', etc.
:(f) Locatives ''nei'' or ''lā'', or particles ''ana'' or ''ai''
:(g) Strengthening particle: ''no''
:(h) Subject
:(i) Object or predicate noun

=== Exceptions to VSO word order ===
If the sentence has a [[negative mood]] and the subject is a pronoun, word order is [[subject–verb–object]] following the negator ''ʻaʻole'', as in:
{|
|''ʻaʻole ʻo ia e puka ana''
not he &lt;small&gt;FUTURE&lt;/small&gt; graduate &lt;small&gt;SINGLE.EVENT&lt;/small&gt;

"He won't graduate"
|}
Another exception is when an emphatic adverbial phrase begins the sentence. In this case, a pronoun subject precedes the verb.&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt;{{rp|p.29}} 

=== Interrogatives ===
[[Yes-no question]]s can be unmarked and expressed by [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]],&lt;ref name="Schutz" /&gt;{{rp|p.32}} or they can be marked by placing ''anei'' after the leading word of the sentence.&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt;{{rp|p.23}} Examples of [[question word|question-word]] questions include:
{|
|''He aha kēia?''

&lt;small&gt;INDEFINITE&lt;/small&gt; What this?

"What is this?"
|''ʻO wai kou inoa?''
&lt;small&gt;PROPER.SUBJECT&lt;/small&gt; who your name

"What is your name?"
|}

==Nouns==
A verb can be nominalized by preceding it with the definite article.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;{{rp|p.37}} Within the noun phrase, adjectives follow the noun (e.g. ''ka hale li{{okina}}ili{{okina}}i'' "the house small", "the small house"), while possessors precede it (e.g. ''kou hale'' "your house"). Numerals precede the noun in the absence of the definite article, but follow the noun if the noun is preceded by the [[definite article]].&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt;{{rp|p.31}}

===Gender===
In Hawaiian, there is no gender distinction based on biological sex. The word for [[grammatical person|third person]] (he, she, it) is ''ia''. It is commonly preceded by ''{{okina}}o'' as in ''{{okina}}o ia'' but should always be written as two words, never as one.

Hawaiian nouns belong to one of two genders, known as the ''kino ʻō'' (o-class) and the ''kino ʻā'' (a-class). These classes are only taken into account when using the genitive case (see table of personal pronouns below).

''Kino ʻō'' nouns, in general, are nouns whose creation cannot be controlled by the subject, such as ''inoa'' "name", ''pu{{okina}}uwai'' "heart", and ''hale'' "house". Specific categories for o-class nouns include: modes of transportation (e.g. ''ka{{okina}}a'' "car" and ''lio'' "horse"), things that you can go into, sit on or wear (e.g., ''lumi'' "room",  ''noho'' "chair", ''{{okina}}eke'' "bag", and ''lole'' "clothes"), and people in your generation (e.g., siblings, cousins) and previous generations (e.g. ''makuahine'' "mother").

''Kino ʻā'' nouns, in general, are those whose creation can be controlled, such as ''waiho{{okina}}olu{{okina}}u'' "color", as in ''ka{{okina}}u waiho{{okina}}olu{{okina}}u punahele'' "my favorite color". Specific categories include: your [[boyfriend]] or [[girlfriend]] (''ipo''), spouse, friends, and future generations in your line (all of your descendants).

The change of preposition of ''o'' "of" (kino ʻō) to ''a'' "of "(kino ʻā) is especially important for prepositional and subordinate phrases:

''ka mea'' "the thing"

''kona mea'' "his thing (nonspecific)"

''kāna mea'' "his thing (which he created or somehow chose)"

''ka mea āna i ʻike ai'' "the thing that he saw"

''kāna (mea) i ʻike ai'' "what he saw"

''kēia ʻike ʻana āna'' "this thing that he saw (purposefully)"

''kēia ʻike ʻana ona'' "this thing that he saw (purportedly)" where the seeing isn't much import

==Verbs==

===Tense, aspect, and mood===

Verbs can be analytically modified to indicate [[Tense (grammar)|tense]], [[Aspect (linguistics)|aspect]] and [[Grammatical mood|mood]] as follows:&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;Alexander, W. D., ''Introduction to Hawaiian Grammar'', Dover, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.19}}

* ''ua'' + verb: [[perfective aspect]], [[past tense]]; or [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] tense/aspect (''ua hana au'' "I worked", "I have worked"). Note that the pre-verbal marker ''ua'' is often omitted in speech.
* ''i'' + verb: past tense (''i hana au'' "I worked"); or, perfect [[participle]] (''i hana'' "having worked", "who had worked")
* ''e'' + verb + ''ana'': [[imperfective aspect]] (''e hana ana au'' "I was working", "I will be working")
* ''ke'' + verb + ''nei'': [[present tense]], [[progressive aspect]] (''ke hana nei au'' "I am working")
* ''e'' + verb: [[future tense]]/mood (''e hana au'' "I will work"); or, [[infinitive]] (''e hana'' "to work"); or, [[imperative mood]] (''e hana ʻoe'' "Work thou!")
* ''mai'' + verb: [[Negation (linguistics)#Grammar|negative]] imperative mood (''mai hana ʻoe''  "Do not work thou!")
* verb + ''ʻia'': passive voice where the agent is marked by ''e'' (''Ua hana ʻia ka honua e ka Haku.'' The world was created by the Creator.)

In his "Introduction to Hawaiian Grammar," W.D. Alexander&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt; proposed that Hawaiian has a pluperfect tense as follows:
* ''ua'' + verb + ''ʻē'': [[pluperfect]] tense/aspect (''ua hana ʻē au'' "I had worked")
However, this is debatable since ''ʻē'' simply means "beforehand, in advance, already".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wehewehe.org/gsdl2.85/cgi-bin/hdict?e=q-11000-00---off-0hdict--00-1----0-10-0---0---0direct-10-ED--4-------0-1lpm--11-haw-Zz-1---Zz-1-home-e--00-3-1-00-0--4----0-0-11-00-0utfZz-8-00&amp;a=d&amp;d=D1765|title=Nā Puke Wehewehe ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi|website=wehewehe.org|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Andrews [Gram. 1.4] suggested the same thing that Alexander forwards. However, ''Ua hana ʻē au'' could mean both "I have already worked", "I already worked", and (depending on the temporal context) "I had worked previous to that moment." "Already" is the operative unifier for these constructions as well as the perfective quality denoted by ''ua''. ''ʻĒ'' therefore is acting like a regular Hawaiian adverb, following the verb it modifies:

''Ua hana paha au.'' Perhaps I worked.

''Ua hana mālie au.'' I worked steadily, without disruption.

''Ua hana naʻe au.'' I even worked.

=== Equative sentences ===
Hawaiian doesn't have a copula verb meaning "to be" nor does it have a verb meaning "to have". [[Equative|Equative sentences]] are used to convey this group of ideas. All equative sentences in Hawaiian are zero-tense/mood (i.e., they cannot be modified by verbal markers, particles or adverbs).

==== ''Pepeke ʻAike He'' "A is a B" ====
''Pepeke ʻAike He'' is the name for the simple equative sentence "A is a(n) B". The pattern is "''He'' B (''ʻo'') A." ʻO marks the third person singular pronoun ''ia'' (which means "he/she/it") and all proper nouns.

''He kaikamahine ʻo Mary.'' Mary is a girl.

''He kaikamahine ʻo ia.'' She is a girl.

''He Hawaiʻi kēlā kaikamahine.'' That girl is (a) Hawaiian.

''He haumana ke keiki.'' The child is a student.

==== ''Pepeke ʻAike ʻO'' ====
''Pepeke ʻAike ʻO'' is the name for the simple equative sentence "A is B." The pattern is " ''ʻO'' A (''ʻo'') B," where the order of the nouns is interchangeable and where ʻo invariably marks the third person singular pronoun ''ia'' and all proper nouns (regardless of where it is in the utterance).

''ʻO Mary ʻo ia. ʻOia ʻo Mary.'' She is Mary.

''ʻO Mary nō ia. ʻOia nō ʻo Mary.'' It's Mary.

''ʻO wau ʻo Mary. ʻO Mary wau.'' I'm Mary.

''ʻO ʻoe ʻo Mary. ʻO Mary ʻoe.'' You are Mary.

''ʻO Mary ke kaikamahine. ʻO ke kaikamahine ʻo Mary.'' Mary is the girl. The girl is Mary.

''ʻO ka haumana ke keiki. ʻO ke keiki ka haumana.'' The student is the child. The child is the student.

==== ''Pepeke Henua'' (Locational equative) ====

===Other verbal particles===

Other post-verbal markers include&lt;ref&gt;''New Pocket Hawaiian Dictionary'', grammar section (pp. 225-243), U. of Hawaii Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.228–231}}

* verb + ''mai'': "toward the speaker"

* verb + ''iho'': "down"
* verb + ''aʻe'': "up", "adjacent"
* stative verb + ''iā'' + agent: agent marker

===Causative verb creation===

[[Causative verb]]s can be created from nouns and adjectives by using the prefix ''ho'o-'', as illustrated in the following:&lt;ref name=Schutz/&gt;{{rp|p.24}}

* ''nani'' "pretty"; ''hoʻonani'' "to beautify"
* ''nui'' "large"; ''hoʻonui'' "to enlarge"

{{Use MDY dates|date=July 2018}}
[[File:Los Angeles Herald, Number 180, 29 May 1916 front page.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Old newspaper featuring headlinese like "WOMAN MYSTERY-DEATH VICTIM" and "Drop 150 Teachers Tonight, Board Plan".|Headlinese has a long history. This example is the front page of the ''[[Los Angeles Herald]]'' issue of May 29, 1916.]]
'''Headlinese''' is an abbreviated form of [[News style|news writing style]] used in [[newspaper]] [[headline]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordnik.com/words/headlinese Headlinese] Collated definitions via ''www.wordnik.com''&lt;/ref&gt; 
Because space is limited, headlines are written in a compressed [[Telegram style|telegraphic style]], using special syntactic conventions, including:

* [[Zero copula|Forms of the verb "to be"]] and [[Article (grammar)|articles]] (''a'', ''an'', ''the'') are usually omitted.
* Most [[verb]]s are in the [[Simple present (English)|simple present]] tense, e.g. "Governor signs bill", while the future is expressed by an [[Infinitive#English|infinitive]], with ''to'' followed by a verb, as in "Governor to sign bill".
* In the United States, [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] are often replaced by a comma, as in "Bush, Blair laugh off microphone mishap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/07/18/bush.tape.reaction/index.html |title=Bush, Blair laugh off microphone mishap |work=[[CNN]].com |date=July 21, 2006 |access-date=July 17, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070816181203/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/07/18/bush.tape.reaction/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archive-date = August 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Individuals are usually specified by surname only, with no [[honorific]]s.
* Organizations and institutions are often indicated by [[metonymy]]: "Wall Street" for "the financial industry", "Whitehall" for the UK government administration, "Madrid" for "the government of Spain", "Davos" for "World Economic Forum", and so on.
* Many [[abbreviation]]s, including [[Contraction (grammar)|contraction]]s and [[acronyms]], are used: in the US, some examples are ''Dems'' (for "[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]") and ''GOP'' (for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] from the nickname "Grand Old Party"); in the UK, ''Lib Dems'' (for the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]), ''[[Tory|Tories]]'' (for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]).  The period (full point) is usually omitted from these abbreviations, though ''U.S.'' may retain them, especially in all-caps headlines to avoid confusion with the word ''us''.
* Lack of a terminating [[full stop]] (period) even if the headline forms a complete sentence.

Some periodicals have their own distinctive headline styles, such as ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and its entertainment-jargon headlines, most famously "[[Sticks Nix Hick Pix]]".

==Commonly used short words==
To save space, headlines often use extremely short words (many of which are not in common use otherwise) in unusual or idiosyncratic ways:
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
*''axe'' (eliminate)
*''bid'' (attempt)
*''blast'' (heavily criticize)
*''cagers'' (basketball team - "cage" is an old term for indoor court)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.si.com/vault/1991/11/11/125381/when-the-court-was-a-cage-in-the-early-days-of-pro-basketball-the-players-were-segregated-from-the-fans ''Sports Illustrated'': "When the Court was a Cage"]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''chop'' (eliminate)
*''confab'' (meeting)&lt;ref&gt;[https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/174181/confab-still-used "Is confab still used?"]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''eye'' (consider)
*''fold'' (shut down)
*''gambit'' (attempt)
*''hike'' (increase)
*''ink'' (sign a contract)
*''laud'' (to praise)
*''lull'' (a pause)
*''mar'' (to damage, harm)
*''mull'' (contemplate)
*''nab'' (grab)
*''nix'' (reject)
*''parley'' (meeting)
*''pen'' (write)
*''rap'' (criticize)
*''see'' (forecast)
*''slam'' (heavily criticize)
*''solon'' (judge)
*''tap'' (select e.g. an appointee)
*''tout''

{{div col end}}

Many verbs can be converted into nouns, e.g. "rap" could be understood as either "criticize" or "criticism" depending on context.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2983">'''Israel Aksenfeld''' (c. 1787 in [[Nemirov]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russian Empire]] &amp;ndash; c. 1868 in [[Paris]], [[France]]) was a [[Jewish|Judæo]]-[[Germany|German]] writer. Although he spoke other languages perfectly{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} ([[Hebrew]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[German language|German]], possibly [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]), he chose to write in [[Yiddish]]. Together with Salomon Ettinger, he was one of the first [[Yiddish]]-language writers of the 19th century and one of the most significant Yiddish writers to emerge before [[Mendele Mocher Sforim]].

He spent the first period of his life among the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]], being himself a disciple of [[Nachman of Breslov|R. Nahman Bratzlaver]] (from [[Bratslav]], a town in [[Ukraine]], in [[Yiddish]]: בראָסלעוו) and the companion of [[Nathan of Breslov|Nathan Bratzlaver]] ([[Nathan of Breslov]]), the editor and publisher of Nahman's works. Later he abandoned his early associations, and removed to [[Odessa]]. By [[autodidact|self-education]] he acquired a wide knowledge of law, literature, and science. He practised as a notary public, and was also a prolific writer of fiction. Like nearly all Russo-Jewish novelists, Aksenfeld was a realist. He derived the themes of his works from contemporary Jewish life, describing with the pen of an artist the conditions, manners, and customs of the [[ghetto]] in the [[Russian Empire]] at the beginning of the eventful reign of Czar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]. He was the author of about twenty works, of which only five—one novel and four dramas—were printed. The most important of his dramatic works is the play in verse, ''Der erschter jiddischer Rekrut in Russland'' (1861),&lt;ref&gt;Tom Sandqvist: "Dada East: The Romanians of Cabaret Voltaire" (Cambridge, MA / London: MIT Press, 2006), p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; a tragedy which presents a remarkably vivid picture of the terrible commotion in the Russian ghetto when, in 1827, the [[ukase]] compelling the Jews to do military service was enforced for the first time. His novel, ''Dos Sterntichl'' (1861) describes the seamy side of Ḥasidism, its intolerance, bigotry, and hypocrisy, and contrasts it with the fair-mindedness and honesty of progressive Judaism. Another work is ''Sefer Chasidim'' (1841).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wissen.de/lexikon/axenfeld-israel Axenfeld, Israel]" (German). ''Lexikon''. wissen.de. Retrieved 2016-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Levine''' (born January 17, 1952) is an American philosopher at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] who received his PhD from [[Harvard University]] in 1981.

He works on [[philosophy of mind]] and is best known for inventing the [[explanatory gap]] argument &lt;ref&gt;Joseph Levine (1983), "Materialism and Qualia: The Explanatory Gap," ''Pacific Philosophical Quarterly'', 64(4), October 1983, pp. 354–361&lt;/ref&gt; and author of popular and academic philosophy books.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Levine (2001), ''Purple Haze. The Puzzle of Consciousness''. Oxford University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Levine (2006), In Kenneth Williford &amp; Uriah Kriegel (eds.), Self-Representational Approaches to Consciousness. The Mit Press. 173--198 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Levine (1993), ''On Leaving Out What It's Like''. In: G. Humphreys und M. Davies (Eds.): ''Consciousness. Psychological and Philosophical Essays''. Basil Blackwell, Oxford 1993, pp. 121–136. Reprint in: N.J. Block, O. Flanagan, and G. Güzeledere (Eds.): ''The Nature of Consciousness. Philosophical Debates''. MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that an unbridgeable gap exists when trying to comprehend [[consciousness]] from the perspective of natural science as a scientific explanation of mental states would require a reduction from a physical process to phenomenal experience. The property of mental states to be experienced from a subjective point of view (see [[Qualia]]) might not be reducible from the objective, i.e. outside perspective of science. In this sense there would be a gap between the outside perspective of science and the internal perspective of phenomenal experience.

Language documentation seeks to create as thorough a record as possible of the speech community for both posterity and [[language revitalization]]. Language documentation also provides a firmer foundation for linguistic analysis in that it creates a citable set of materials in the language on which claims about the structure of the language can be based.

== Methods ==
{{Main|Language documentation tools and methods}}
Typical steps involve recording, maintaining metadata, transcribing (often using the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] and/or a "practical [[orthography]]" made up for that language), annotation and analysis, translation into a language of wider communication, archiving and dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|date=2018
|publisher=Leanpub
|url=https://leanpub.com/languageandculturedocumentationmanual|accessdate=2018-01-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Critical is the creation of good records in the course of doing language description. The materials can be archived, but not all archives are equally adept at handling language materials preserved in varying technological formats, and not all are equally accessible to potential users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gial.edu/images/theses/Chang_Debbie-thesis.pdf Chang, Debbie. 2011. TAPS: Checklist for Responsible Archiving of Digital Language Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617120932/http://www.gial.edu/images/theses/Chang_Debbie-thesis.pdf |date=2013-06-17 }}. MA thesis: Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language documentation complements [[descriptive linguistics|language description]], which aims to describe a language's abstract system of structures and rules in the form of a grammar or dictionary. By preparing good documentation in the form of recordings with transcripts and then collections of texts and a dictionary, a linguist works better and also provide materials for use by speakers of the language. New technologies permit better recordings, with better descriptions, all of which can be housed in digital archives, like [[Archive_of_the_Indigenous_Languages_of_Latin_America|AILLA]] or [[PARADISEC]], and be made available to the speakers with little effort.

Language documentation has also given birth to new specialized publications, such as the free online and peer-reviewed journals ''[[Language Documentation &amp; Description]]'' and ''[[Language Documentation &amp; Conservation]]''

==Types==
Language description, as a task within linguistics, may be divided into separate areas of specialization:
* [[Phonetics]], the study of the sounds of human language
* [[Phonology]], the study of the sound system of a language
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]], the study of the internal structure of words
* [[Syntax]], the study of how words combine to form grammatical sentences
* [[Semantics]], the study of the meaning of words ([[lexical semantics]]), and how these combine to form the meanings of sentences
* [[Historical linguistics]], the study of languages whose historical relations are recognizable through similarities in vocabulary, word formation, and syntax
* [[Pragmatics (linguistics)|Pragmatics]], the study of how language is used by its speakers
* [[Stylistics (linguistics)|Stylistics]], the study of style in languages
* [[Paremiography]], the collection of proverbs and sayings

== Related research areas ==
* [[Descriptive linguistics]]
* [[Orthography]], the study of writing systems
* [[Lexicography]], the study and practice of making dictionaries
* [[Phonology]], the study of describing the sound system of a language
* [[Etymology]], the study of how words acquire their meanings
* [[Anthropological linguistics]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5499">{{Redirect|Love–hate||Love Hate (disambiguation){{!}}Love Hate}}
A '''love–hate relationship''' is an [[interpersonal relationship]] involving simultaneous or alternating [[emotion]]s of [[love]] and [[hate]]—something particularly common when [[emotion]]s are intense.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (1976) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is used frequently in [[psychology]], popular writing, and [[journalism]]. It can be applied to [[Object sexuality|relationships with inanimate objects]], or even [[concept]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10553024 | work=The Economist | title=A love-hate relationship | date=19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-19882_3-10281561-250.html|title=Skyhook's love/hate relationship with GPS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as those of a [[Romantic love|romantic]] nature or between [[Sibling relationship|siblings]] and parents/children.&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Skura, ''Shakespeare the Actor'' (1993) pp. 286–7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological roots==
A love–hate relationship has been linked to the occurrence of emotional [[ambivalence]] in early childhood;&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; to conflicting responses by different [[Transactional analysis|ego states]] within the same person;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (1970) p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; or to the inevitable co-existence of [[Psychological egoism|egoistic]] conflicts with the object of love.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Narcissism|Narcissists]] have been seen as particularly prone to aggressive reactions towards love objects,&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits'' (1997) pp. 24–5&lt;/ref&gt; not least when issues of self-identity are involved:&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (1969) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; in extreme instances, hate at the very existence of the [[Other (philosophy)|other]] may be the only emotion felt, until love breaks through behind it.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism'' (2003) pp. 85–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Research from [[Yale University]] suggests love–hate relationships may be the result of poor [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/the-mystery-behind-love-hate-relationships-10767.html|title=The mystery behind love-hate relationships - ScienceBlog.com|date=8 June 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrities==

The term is sometimes employed by writers to refer to relationships between celebrity couples who have been divorced, then who reunite (notably [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Richard Burton]], or [[Eminem]] and Kimberly Scott), as well as to their relationship with fame itself.&lt;ref&gt;Skura, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

A love–hate relationship may develop when people have completely lost the [[intimacy]] within a loving relationship, yet still retain some [[passion (emotion)|passion]] for, or perhaps some [[promise|commitment]] to, each other, before degenerating into a hate–love relationship leading to divorce.&lt;ref&gt;A. Pam and J. Pearson, ''Splitting Up'' (1998) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Friendship==

[[Tony Blair#Gordon Brown|Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]'s political friendship took on at times all the characteristics of a love–hate relationship, if one between friends and allies.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Seldon, ''Blair Unbound'' (2007) p. 546 and 574&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] said of himself that “an intimate friend and a hated enemy have always been indispensable to my emotional life...not infrequently…friend and enemy have coincided in the same person”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (1964) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] warned of the conflicts that can arise from conflicting claims within friendships.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 281-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

*The Japanese word "[[tsundere]]" comes from two words—tsuntsun (aloof, irritable, cold) and deredere (lovestruck). A tsundere character is one who frequently switches between insulting their love interest and acting lovestruck or kind toward them. Tsundere characters usually belittle their love interest at first but eventually become kinder to them over time.
*[[Catullus]] introduced the love–hate theme into Western culture with his famous lines: "I hate and yet love. You may wonder how I manage it. I don't know, but feel it happen, and am in torment".&lt;ref&gt;J. Boardman et al eds, ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (1991) p. 489&lt;/ref&gt;
*The concept of a love–hate relationship is frequently used in teen [[romance novels]] where two characters are shown to "hate" each other, but show some sort of affection or attraction towards each other at certain points of the story.

The '''Pan South African Language Board''' ({{lang-af|Pan-Suid-Afrikaanse Taalraad }}, abbreviated '''PanSALB''') is an organization in [[South Africa]] established to promote [[multilingualism]], to develop the [[Languages of South Africa|11 official languages]], and to protect [[Linguistic rights|language rights]] in South Africa. The Board was established in Act 59 of 1995 by the [[Parliament of South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{web cite|title=PanSALB History|url=http://www.pansalb.org/history1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the 11 official languages of South Africa, PanSALB also strives for the development of the [[Khoe languages|Khoe]], [[Khoisan languages|San]], and [[South African Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{web cite|title=NO. 59 OF 1995: PAN SOUTH AFRICAN LANGUAGE BOARD ACT, 1995.|url=http://www.dac.gov.za/sites/default/files/Legislations%20Files/a59-95.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PanSALB structures include: Provincial Language Committees, the National Language Bodies and the National Lexicography Units.

==Controversy==
In January 2016, South African [[Minister of Arts and Culture]], [[Nathi Mthethwa]] dissolved the entire board of PanSALB, after a report that between 2014 and 2015, the board's administrative expenditure had increased from 8 million to 11 million [[South African rand|ZAR]], while the expenditure on its mandate dropped to 17 million from 23 million ZAR, while its irregular expenditure was 28 million. &lt;ref&gt;{{web cite|title=Multilingualism: Pan South African Language Board going nowhere slowly, haemorrhaging millions|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-02-25-multilingualism-pan-south-african-language-board-going-nowhere-slowly-haemorrhaging-millions/#.Wk5s01WnFEY|author=Marianne Thamm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paula Grogger''' (12 July 1892 in [[Öblarn]] - 1 January 1984 in Öblarn) was an Austrian writer.

== Life ==
Paula Grogger was the daughter of the merchant Franz Grogger and his wife Maria  from Öblarn in Styria. From 1907 to 1912, she attended the teachers training college of the [[Ursuline nuns]] in [[Salzburg]]. She was  one of the few women at the time to take the Austrian matriculation examination, the [[Matura]]. She then returned to Styria and taught the [[Enns (river)|Enns]] handicrafts until 1929.

He first novel, ''The Grimmingtor'' (1926) was a triumphant success and drew a picture of the Styrian landscape with the symbol of the mountain [[Grimming]]. The style, the criticism was simply, dialect and yet strong. Similar to the work of [[Enrica von Handel-Mazzetti]], the novel was still independent, with hearty humor and restrained tragedy and high above the common literature.&lt;ref name="Lux" /&gt; The book was repeatedly translated and republished.

Paula Grogger belonged to the illegal [[Nazi Bund]] of German writers in Austria. After the [[Anschluss|Austrian Annexation]], in 1938, she paid homage to [[Adolf Hitler]] in the ''Confession book of German poets''.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Klee: ''Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945''. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, S. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bund Deutscher Schriftsteller Österreichs (Hrsg.): ''Bekenntnisbuch Österreichischer Dichter''. Krystall Verlag, Wien 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Gestapo, however, concerning Grogger's political stance, presented a request to the District Administrator of [[Gröbming]], he replied on 6 November 1939: ″To this day she made no positive contribution to National Socialism.″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reismann |first=Bernhard A. |title=„Sehr katholisch und religiös eingestellt“. Eine Gestapoanfrage über die Schriftstellerin Paula Grogger aus dem Jahr 1939 |language=de |journal=Blätter für Heimatkunde |location=Graz |publisher=Historischer Verein für Steiermark |volume=78 |issue=3/4 |pages=85–92 |issn=0006-4459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, she was awarded the [[Peter Rosegger Prize]] of the province of Styria. In 1966 she was appointed as a professor. She received honors including the Poet Steinschild of 1999, the Enrica-Handel-Mazzetti-special prize, the Silver Archduke Johann plaque, and the Ring of Honor of Styria.

She was deeply religious and interested in folklore, and was also involved in [[Community theatre]].&lt;ref name="Lux"&gt;Antonius Lux (Hrsg.): Große Frauen der Weltgeschichte. Tausend Biographien in Wort und Bild. Sebastian Lux Verlag, München 1963, S. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, she retired from literary activity at the age of 88 years, and she died at 91 years old, in her house in Öblarn, which serves today as a museum.

'''Quinqui [[jargon]]''' is associated with ''[[quincalleros]]'' ([[tinker]]s), a semi-nomadic group who live mainly in the northern half of [[Spain]]. They prefer to be called ''mercheros''. They are reduced in number and possibly vanishing as a distinct group.

The language is an old form of Castilian, ''[[Germanía]]'', with elements of [[Caló language|Caló]], a dialect of the Spanish [[Romani people|Roma]].  The term comes from the word ''quincallería'' (ironmongery), from [[ironmonger]]s who originated this [[Cant (language)|cant]] as part of their trade.  Because the men were frequently blamed for petty crime, in modern [[Spanish language|Spanish]] the word is associated with references to [[wikt:delinquent|delinquent]], [[petty thief]], or hoodlum. The mercheros identify as a distinct group separate from the Roma ''[[Romani people in Spain|gitanos]]''.

Scholars have many theories about the social origins of ''mercheros'', summarized as the following:  
*Descendants of mechanical workers who arrived in Spain from central Europe in the 16th century;
*Descendants of peasants who lost their land in the 16th century; 
*Descendants of intermarriage between the Roma and non-Roma populations; 
*[[Morisco|Descendants of Muslims]] who became nomads after the expulsion in the 15th century to escape persecution; and/or 
*A mixture of the above.

==Notable mercheros==
*[[Eleuterio Sánchez]], a.k.a. ''[[El Lute]]''.  A petty thief in his early life, he was convicted of armed robbery and murder; after escaping from prison, he was listed as "The Most Wanted" by the Spanish police.  Later he earned a law degree and wrote five books.  He was pardoned at age 39.

'''Shloyme Zanvl Rappoport''' (1863 &amp;ndash; November 8, 1920), known by his pseudonym '''S. Ansky''' (or '''An-sky'''), was a [[History of the Jews in Belarus|Jewish]] author, playwright, researcher of Jewish folklore, polemicist, and cultural and political activist. He is best known for his play ''[[The Dybbuk]]'' or ''Between Two Worlds'', written in 1914.

In 1917, after the [[Russian Revolution]], he was elected to the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]] as a [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Social-Revolutionary]] deputy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jhom.com/personalities/ansky/index.htm|title=S. Ansky (1863-1920)|publisher=Jewish Heritage Online Magazine|accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Ravnitzki An-ski Mocher Sforim Bialik Frug.jpg|thumb|250px|Odessa writers.  From left to right: Y. Ravnitzki, Ansky, [[Mendele Mocher Sforim]], [[H. N. Bialik]], S. Frug.  Published in [[Simon Dubnow]]'s newspaper in 1916]]
S. Ansky was born in [[Chashniki|Czaśniki]], [[Vitebsk Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Belarus|Bielarus]]), and died in [[Otwock]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] on November 8, 1920.

==Ethnographic work==
Under the influence of the Russian [[narodnik]] movement, Ansky became interested in [[ethnography]], as well as socialism, and became a political activist.  Between 1911 and the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, he headed ethnographic expeditions to various Jewish towns of [[Volhynia]] and [[Podolia]], composing a detailed ethnographic questionnaire of more than 2000 questions.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Deutsch, ''The Jewish Dark Continent: Life and Death in the Russian Pale of Settlement''. Harvard University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ansky's ethnographic collections were locked away in Soviet vaults for years, but some material has come to light since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene M. Avrutin, ed. ''Photographing the Jewish Nation: Pictures from S. An-sky's Ethnographic Expeditions''. Tauber Institute for the Study of European Jewry. Waltham, Mass.: Brandeis, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The State Ethnographic Museum at St. Petersburg holds a good deal of it.&lt;ref name=Tracing&gt;Tracing An-sky: Jewish Collections from the State Ethnographic Museum in St. Petersburg, Amsterdam 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his vast collection of cylinder recordings made on these expeditions have been transferred to CD as well.&lt;ref name=Wax&gt;Materials of J.

His ethnographic report of the deliberate destruction of Jewish communities by the Russian army in the First World War, ''The Enemy at His Pleasure: A Journey Through the Jewish Pale of Settlement During World War I,''  has become a major source in the historiography of the war's impact on civilian populations.&lt;ref&gt;Ansky (An-ski), S.

New York: Metrpolitan Books/Henry Holt, 2003. {{ISBN|9780805059441}}. p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
[[File:Mauzoleum Trzech Pisarzy 4.JPG|thumb|Mausoleum of the Three Writers (Peretz, Dinezon, and Ansky) in Warsaw]]
Initially he wrote in [[Russian language|Russian]], but from 1904 he became known mainly as a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] author.

He is best known for his play ''[[The Dybbuk]]'' or ''Between Two Worlds'', written in 1914. The play was first staged in the Elyseum Theatre in [[Warsaw]] two months after the author's death on November 8, 1920. It was subsequently translated into a dozen or more languages and performed thousands of times all over the world. It is still being produced, along with numerous adaptations, as well as operas, ballets, and symphonic suites. (For example, in 2011 there were seven different productions.) It is considered the jewel of the Jewish theatre.&lt;ref&gt;1. Fernando Peñalosa, ''The Dybbuk: Text, Subtext, and Context''. Tsiterboym Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years ''The Dybbuk'' was considered so significant that parodies of it were written and produced.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Peñalosa, tr., ''Parodies of An-sky’s The Dybbuk. Bilingual Edition''. Tsiterboym Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''The Dybbuk'' is Ansky’s best-known work, he published an impressive number of works of literature, politics and ethnography. His ''Collected Works'', which do not include all his writings, comprise fifteen volumes.&lt;ref&gt;S. An-sky. ''Gezamelte Shriften''. Vilna, Warsaw, New York: Wydawnistwo “AN-SKI,” 1922. Reprinted 1926 and 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; An-sky wrote a number of other plays, four of which are included in this collection, long out of print. One (''Day and Night'') is,  like ''The Dybbuk'', a Hasidic Gothic story. The other three plays have revolutionary themes, and were originally written in Russian: ''Father and Son'', ''In a Conspiratorial Apartment'', and ''The Grandfather''. All four  have recently been republished in a bilingual Yiddish-English edition.&lt;ref&gt;''S. An-sky. Four Plays. Bilingual  Edition,'' tr. Fernando Peñalosa. Tsiterboym Books, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ansky was also the author of the song ''[[Di Shvue]]'' (The Oath), which became the anthem of the Jewish Socialist [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] party. He was the author of the poem (later made into a song) "[[In Zaltsikn Yam]]" (In the Salty Sea), which was dedicated to the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|Bund]] as well.

A '''sabot''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|s|æ|ˈ|b|əʊ|,_|ˈ|s|æ|b|əʊ}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|s|eɪ|b|oʊ}}) is a structural device used in [[firearm]] or [[cannon]] ammunition to keep a sub-caliber flight [[projectile]], such as a relatively small [[bullet]] or arrow-type projectile, in the center of the [[barrel (firearms)|barrel]] when fired, if the bullet has a significantly smaller diameter than the [[caliber|bore]] diameter of the weapon used. 

The sabot component in projectile design is more than simply the relatively thin, tough and deformable seal known as a [[driving band]] or [[obturation]] ring needed to trap [[propellant]] gases behind a projectile, and also keep the projectile centered in the barrel, when the outer shell of the projectile is only slightly smaller in diameter than the caliber of the barrel. Driving bands and obturators are used to seal these full-bore projectiles in the barrel because of manufacturing tolerances; there always exists some gap between the projectile outer diameter and the barrel inner diameter, usually a few thousandths of an inch; enough of a gap for high pressure gasses to slip by during firing. Driving bands and obturator rings are made from material that will deform and seal the barrel as the projectile is forced from the chamber into the barrel. Small caliber jacketed bullets do not normally employ driving bands or obturators because the jacket material, for example copper or [[gilding metal]], is deformable enough to serve that function, and the bullet is made slightly larger than the barrel for that purpose, (see [[full metal jacket bullet]] and [[driving band]]). 

Sabots certainly use driving bands and obturators, because the same manufacturing tolerance issues exist when sealing the saboted projectile in the barrel, but the sabot itself is a more substantial structural component of the in-bore projectile configuration (Drysdale 1978).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a056428.pdf Sabot Design for a 105mm APFSDS Kinetic Energy Projectile, June 1978, Drysdale, Kirkendall, Kokinakis, US Army Ballistics Research Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;   Refer to the two [[APFSDS]] (armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot) pictures on the right to see the substantial material nature of a sabot to fill the bore diameter around the sub-caliber arrow-type flight projectile, compared to the very small gap sealed by a driving band or obturator to mitigate what is known classically as [[windage]].  More detailed cutaways of the internal structural complexity of advanced APFSDS saboted long rod penetrator projectiles can be found at reference 2.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pinterest.com/rickdom09/apfsds/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The function of a sabot is to provide a larger bulkhead structure that fills the entire bore area between an intentionally designed sub-caliber flight projectile and the barrel, giving a larger surface area for propellant gasses to act upon than just the base of the smaller flight projectile (Drysdale 1978). Efficient aerodynamic design of a flight projectile does not always accommodate efficient interior ballistic design to achieve high muzzle velocity.  This is especially true for arrow-type projectiles, which are long and thin for low drag efficiency, but too thin to shoot from a gun barrel of equal diameter to achieve high muzzle velocity. The physics of [[interior ballistics]] demonstrates why the use of a sabot is advantageous to achieve higher muzzle velocity with an arrow-type projectile. Propellant gasses generate high pressure, and the larger the base area that pressure acts upon the greater the net force on that surface. Force, pressure times area, provides an acceleration to the mass of the projectile. Therefore, for a given pressure and barrel diameter, a lighter projectile can be driven from a barrel to a higher muzzle velocity than a heavier projectile. However, a lighter projectile may not fit in the barrel, because it is too thin. To make up this difference in diameter, a properly designed sabot provides less parasitic mass than if the flight projectile were made full-bore, in particular providing dramatic improvement in muzzle velocity for APDS ([[Armor-piercing discarding sabot]]) and APFSDS ammunition.  Seminal research on two important sabot configurations for long rod penetrators used in APFSDS ammunition, namely the "saddle-back" and "double-ramp" sabot was performed by the US Army Ballistics Research Laboratory during the development and improvement of modern 105mm and 120mm kinetic energy APFSDS penetrators(Drysdale 1978), permitted by the significant recent advancement in the computerized [[Finite element method in structural mechanics]] at that time; and now represents the existing fielded technology standard. (See for example the development of the [[M829]] series of anti-tank projectiles beginning with the base model M829 in the early 1980s, to the recently fielded M829A4 model, employing ever longer "double-ramp" sabots). Upon muzzle exit, the sabot is discarded, and the smaller flight projectile flies to the target with less drag resistance than a full-bore projectile. In this manner, very high velocity and slender, low drag projectiles can be fired more efficiently, (see [[external ballistics]] and [[terminal ballistics]]). Nevertheless, the weight of the sabot represents parasitic mass that must also be accelerated to muzzle velocity, but does not contribute to the terminal ballistics of the flight projectile.  For this reason, great emphasis is placed on selecting strong yet lightweight structural materials for the sabot, and configuring the sabot geometry to efficiently employ these parasitic materials at minimum weight penalty (Drysdale 1978).

The purpose of the sabot is to allow a smaller diameter flight projectile to be launched at greater muzzle velocity than if the flight projectile alone were fired from a gun of equal caliber (full-bore). Firing a smaller-sized projectile wrapped in a sabot raises the muzzle velocity of the projectile.  Made of some lightweight material (usually high strength plastic in small caliber rifles, (see SLAP [[Saboted light armor penetrator]]), [[shotguns]] and [[muzzle loader]] ammunition; aluminium, steel, and carbon fiber reinforced plastic for modern anti-tank kinetic energy ammunition; and, in classic times, wood or [[papier-mâché]] – in muzzle loading cannons).  The sabot usually consists of several longitudinal pieces held in place by the cartridge case, an obturator or driving band. When the projectile is fired, the sabot blocks the gas, provides significant structural support against launch acceleration, and carries the projectile down the barrel. When the sabot reaches the end of the barrel, the shock of hitting still air pulls the parts of the sabot away from the projectile, allowing the projectile to continue in flight. Modern sabots are made from high strength aluminum and graphite fiber reinforced epoxy. They are used primarily to fire long rods of very dense materials, such as tungsten heavy alloy and depleted uranium. (see for example the [[M829]] series of anti-tank projectiles). 

Sabot-type shotgun slugs were marketed in the United States starting in about 1985.  When used with a [[rifled]] [[slug barrel]], they offer vastly improved accuracy compared to traditional shotgun slugs.  They are now legal for [[hunting]] in most U.S. states.

==Types==
[[File:Sabot types.svg|thumb|left|Sabot types:&lt;br&gt;
1. Cup type sabot&lt;br&gt;
2. Expanding cup sabot&lt;br&gt;
3. Base sabot&lt;br&gt;
4. Spindle sabot&lt;br&gt;
5. Ring sabot]]
[[File:Shotgun-shot-sequence-1g.jpg|right|thumb| Series of individual 1/1,000,000 second exposures showing shotgun firing shot and expanding cup sabot separation.]]

===Cup sabot===
A cup sabot supports the base and rear end of a projectile, and the cup material alone can provide both structural support and barrel obturation.  When the sabot and projectile exit the muzzle of the gun, air pressure alone on the sabot forces the sabot to release the projectile.  Cup sabots are found typically in small arms ammunition, smooth-bore shotgun and smooth-bore muzzleloader projectiles.

===Expanding cup sabot===
Used typically in rifled small arms (SLAP, shotguns and muzzleloaders), an expanding cup sabot has a one piece sabot surrounding the base and sides of a projectile, providing both structural support and obturation.  Upon firing, when the sabot and projectile leave the muzzle of the gun, [[centrifugal force]] from the rotation of the projectile, due to barrel rifling, opens up the segments surrounding the projectile, rapidly presenting more surface area to air pressure, quickly releasing it.

Although the use of cup sabots of various complexity are popular with rifle ammunition hand-loaders, in order to achieve significantly higher muzzle velocity with a lower drag, smaller diameter and lighter bullet, successful saboted projectile design has to include the resulting bullet stability characteristics.  For example, simply inserting a commercially available 5.56mm (.224) bullet into a sabot that will fire it from a commercially available 7.62mm (.300) barrel may result in that 5.56mm bullet failing to achieve sufficient gyroscopic stability to fly accurately without tumbling.  To achieve gyroscopic stability of longer bullets in smaller diameter requires faster rifling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/801509.pdf Design for Control of Projectile Flight Characteristics, AMCP 706-242, US Army Materiel Command, 1966]&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, if a bullet requires at least 1 turn in 7 inch twist, (1:7 rifling), in 5.56mm, it will also require at least 1:7 rifling when saboted in 7.62mm.  However, larger caliber commercial rifles generally don't need such fast twist rates; 1:10 being a readily available standard in 7.62mm.  As a result, the twist rate of the larger barrel will dictate which smaller bullets can be fired with sufficient stability out of a sabot.  In this example, using 1:10 rifling in 7.62mm restricts saboting to 5.56mm bullets that require 1:10 twist or slower, and this requirement will tend to restrict saboting to the shorter (and lighter) 5.56mm bullets.

===Base sabot===
A base sabot has a one piece base which supports the bottom of the projectile, and separate pieces that surround the sides of the projectile and center it. The base sabot can have better and cleaner sabot/projectile separation than cup or expanding cup sabots for small arms ammunition, but may be more expensive to manufacture and assemble.

In larger caliber APDS ammunition, based on the cup, expanding cup, and base sabot concepts, significantly more complex assemblies are required.  Reference 3 presents a cutaway of a modern 105mm APDS Armoured Piercing Discarding Sabot showing its numerous internal parts and sub-assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;http://norfolktankmuseum.co.uk/types-of-ammunition/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spindle sabot===
A spindle sabot uses a set of at least two and upwards of four matched longitudinal rings or "petals" which have a center section in contact with a long arrow-type projectile; a front section or "bore-rider" which centers that projectile in the barrel and provides an air scoop to assist in sabot separation upon muzzle exit, and a rear section which both centers the projectile, provides a structural "bulkhead", and seals propellant gases with an obturator ring around the outside diameter.  Spindle sabots are the standard type used in modern large caliber armor-piercing ammunition. Three-petal spindle-type sabots are shown in the illustrations at the right of this paragraph.  The "double-ramp" and "saddle-back" sabots used on modern APFSDS ammunition are a form of spindle sabot (Drysdale 1978).

[[Shotgun slug]]s often use a cast [[plastic]] sabot similar to the spindle sabot.  Shotgun sabots in general extend the full length of the projectile and are designed to be used more effectively in [[rifled]] barrels.

===Ring sabot===
[[File:125mm Bm15 APFSDS.JPG|thumb|right|Soviet BM-15 armor-piercing round with ring sabot]]

A ring sabot uses the rear fins on a long rod projectile to help center the projectile and ride the bore, and the multi-petal sabot forms only a single bulkhead ring around the projectile near the front, with an obturator sealing gases from escaping past it, and centering the front of the projectile.  The former Soviet Union favored armor-piercing sabot projectiles using ring sabots, which performed acceptably for that era, manufactured from high strength steel for both the long rod penetrator and ring sabot.  The strength of the steel ring was sufficient to withstand launch accelerations without the need for sabot ramps to also support the steel flight projectile.&lt;ref&gt;http://fofanov.armor.kiev.ua/Tanks/ARM/apfsds/ammo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA_notice}}

The '''Scottish vowel length rule''' (also known as '''Aitken's law''' after [[Adam Jack Aitken|A. J. Aitken]], the Scottish linguist who formulated it) describes how [[vowel length]] in [[Scots language|Scots]], [[Scottish English]], and, to some extent, [[Mid-Ulster English]]&lt;ref&gt;Harris J. (1985) Phonological Variation and Change: Studies in Hiberno English, Cambridge. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; is conditioned by the [[phonetic environment]] of the target [[vowel]].

Certain vowels are long before {{IPA|/r/}}, [[Fricative consonant|voiced fricatives]] or a [[morpheme]] boundary. Also, vowels in word-final open [[syllable]]s are long.

== Phonemes ==

The underlying [[phoneme]]s of the Scottish vowel system are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Aitken A.J. (1984) ‘Scottish Accents and Dialects’ in ‘Language in the British Isles’ Trudgill, P. (ed). pp.94-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|Phonological history of Scots}}

The Scottish Vowel Length Rule is assumed to have come into being between the early [[Middle Scots]] and late Middle Scots period.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken A.J. (1981) 'The Scottish Vowel-Length Rule' in 'So meny People Longages and Tonges' Benskin, M. and Samuels M.S. (eds). p.137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the [[Simulacra and Simulation|three order simulacra]], the '''second-order simulacra''', a term coined by [[Jean Baudrillard]], are [[symbol]]s of a non faithful representation to the original. Here, signs and images do not faithfully show us reality, but might hint at the existence of something real which the sign itself is incapable of encapsulating.&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard 1994 [1981], Simulacra and Simulation, University of Michigan Press, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

While the first-order simulacra is a faithful copy to the original and the third order are symbols that have become without referents, that is, symbols with no real object to represent but pretends to be a faithful copy of an original. Simply put, a third-order simulacra are symbols in themselves taken for reality and further layer of [[symbol]]ism is added. This occurs when the symbol is taken to be more important or authoritative of the original entity, authenticity has been replaced by copy (thus reality is replaced by a substitute).

The consequence of the propagation of second-order [[simulacra]] is that, within the affected context, nothing is "real," though those engaged in the illusion are incapable of seeing it. Instead of having experiences, people observe spectacles, via real or [[metaphor]]ical control screens. Instead of the real, we have simulation and simulacra, the [[Hyperreality|hyperreal]].

In his essay "The Precession of the Simulacra," Baudrillard recalls a tale from a short story by [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]] in which a king requests a map (i.e. a symbol) to be produced so detailed that it ends up coming into one-to-one correspondence with the territory (i.e. the real area the map is to represent); this references the philosophical concept of [[map–territory relation]]. Baudrillard argues that in the [[postmodern]] epoch, the territory ceases to exist, and there is nothing left but the map; or indeed, the very concepts of the map and the territory have become indistinguishable, the distinction which once existed between them having been erased.

Among the many issues associated with the propagation of second-order simulacra to the third-order is what Baudrillard considers the termination of history. The method of this termination comes through the lack of oppositional elements in society, with the mass having become "the [[silent majority]]," an imploded concept which absorbs images passively, becoming itself a media overwritten by those who speak for it (i.e. the people are symbolically represented by governing agents and market statistic, marginalizing the people themselves). For Baudrillard this is the natural result of an ethic of unity in which actually agonistic opposites are taken to be essentially the same. For example, Baudrillard contends that [[moral universalism]] (human rights, equality) is equated with [[globalization]], which is not concerned with immutable values but with mediums of exchange and equalisation such as the global market and [[mass media]].

In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical computer science]], a '''set constraint''' is an equation or an inequation between sets of [[term (logic)#Formal definition|terms]].
Similar to systems of ([[inequation#Solving inequations|in]])[[equation solving|equation]]s between numbers, methods are studied for solving systems of set constraints. 
Different approaches admit different operators (like "∪", "∩", "\", and function application)&lt;ref group=note&gt;If ''f'' is an ''n''-ary function symbol admitted in a term, then "''f''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)" is a set expression denoting the set { ''f''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) : ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;∈''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ... and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;∈''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; }, where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are set expressions in turn.&lt;/ref&gt; on sets and different (in)equation relations (like "=", "⊆", and "⊈") between set expressions.

Systems of set constraints are useful to describe (in particular infinite) sets of [[ground term]]s.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This is similar to describing e.g. a [[rational number]] as a solution to an equation ''a''⋅''x'' + ''b'' = 0, with [[integer]] coefficients ''a'', ''b''.&lt;/ref&gt;
They arise in program analysis, [[abstract interpretation]], and [[type inference]].

==Relation to regular tree grammars==

Each [[regular tree grammar]] can be systematically transformed into a system of set inclusions such that its minimal solution corresponds to the tree language of the grammar.

For example, the grammar (terminal and nonterminal symbols indicated by lower and upper case initials, respectively) with the rules
:{|
|-
| ''Bool''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; || → ''false''
|-
| ''Bool''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; || → ''true''
|-
| ''BList''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; || → ''nil''
|-
| ''BList''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; || → ''cons''(''Bool''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;,''BList''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;)
|-
| ''BList1''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; || → ''cons''(''true'',''BList''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;)
|-
| ''BList1''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; || → ''cons''(''false'',''BList1''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;)
|}
is transformed to the set inclusion system (constants and variables indicated by lower and upper case initials, respectively):
:{|
|-
| ''Bool''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; || ⊇ ''false''
|-
| ''Bool''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; || ⊇ ''true''
|-
| ''BList''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; || ⊇ ''nil''
|-
| ''BList''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; || ⊇ ''cons''(''Bool''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;,''BList''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;)
|-
| ''BList1''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; || ⊇ ''cons''(''true'',''BList''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;)
|-
| ''BList1''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; || ⊇ ''cons''(''false'',''BList1''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;)
|}
This system has a minimal solution, viz. ("''L''(''N'')" denoting the tree language corresponding to the nonterminal ''N'' in the above tree grammar):
:{|
|- 
| ''Bool''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; || = ''L''(''Bool''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;) || = { ''false'', ''true'' }
|-
| ''BList''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; || = ''L''(''BList''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;) || = { ''nil'', ''cons''(''false'',''nil''), ''cons''(''true'',''nil''), ''cons''(''false'',''cons''(''false'',''nil'')), ... }
|-
| ''BList1''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; || = ''L''(''BList1''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;) || = { ''nil'', ''cons''(''true'',''nil''), ''cons''(''true'',''cons''(''false'',''nil'')),... }
|}
The maximal solution of the system is trivial; it assigns the set of all terms to every variable.

'''Shantabai Krushnaji Kamble''' (born  1 March 1923) is a [[Marathi language|Marathi]] writer and [[Dalit]] activist. She wrote the first female Dalit autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=p4-oDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT171&amp;dq=shantabai+kamble&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwid_5j8z_vUAhUMM48KHS7ICy0Q6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=shantabai%20kamble&amp;f=false|title=Writing Caste/Writing Gender: Narrating Dalit Women's Testimonies|last=Rege|first=Sharmila|date=2014-04-01|publisher=Zubaan|isbn=9789383074679|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early age===
Shantabai Krushnaji Kamble was born in a [[Mahar]] [[Dalit]] family on 1 March 1923. Her birthplace was Mahud which is located in [[Solapur]]. She was from a poor family. The social and economic status of her community was quite low.

===Educational struggle===

In India, the traditional attitude towards those belonging to the lower castes can  be summed up as: "Education is not their cup of tea."  So education was prohibited for the members of her community. Even worse, she was female and girls did not go to school in those days. But her parents decided to send her to school because of her extraordinary talent. According to a newspaper article, "As an untouchable, she [was] not allowed to enter the class-room and has to go through the humiliating experience of sitting outside the class and imbibing whatever she could."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bande|first1=Usha|title=The double burden|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/1999/99mar07/sunday/head6.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Her book==
Shantabai Kamble's [[Majya Jalmachi Chittarkatha]] published as a complete book in [[1986 in literature|1986]] but presented to readers and television audiences in serial form named as [[Najuka]] through the early 1980s, is considered the first [[autobiographical]] narrative by a [[Dalit|Dalit woman]] writer. This book is included in the [[University of Mumbai]]'s syllabus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nabindia.org/docs/talking_books_marathi_list.doc Majhya Jalmachi Chitra Katha (TYBA) Shantabai K.

While English is one of Singapore's official languages, Singlish is commonly regarded as having low 
[[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CAVALLARO|first=FRANCESCO|last2=NG|first2=BEE CHIN|last3=SEILHAMER|first3=MARK FIFER|date=2014-09-01|title=Singapore Colloquial English: Issues of prestige and identity|url=https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/wiley/singapore-colloquial-english-issues-of-prestige-and-identity-yHE30bfQcF|journal=World Englishes|language=en|volume=33|issue=3|pages=378–397|doi=10.1111/weng.12096|issn=0883-2919}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Singaporean government and some Singaporeans alike heavily discourage the use of Singlish in favour of [[Standard English]]. The government has created an annual [[Speak Good English Movement]] to emphasise the point. Singlish is also heavily discouraged in the mass media and in schools.&lt;ref&gt;Tan Hwee Hwee, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,501020729-322685,00.html "A War of Words Over 'Singlish'"], ''Time Magazine'', New York, 22 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However, such official discouragement and routine censorship is actually countered by other presentations in mainstream media, including routine usage by ordinary people in street interviews broadcast on TV and radio on a daily basis, as well as occasional usage in newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, an entire opinion column written in Singlish by ''The Straits Times'' regular columnist [[Koh, Buck Song]], "To have or not to have a dictionary, big question leh", published 24 April 1995, available online at:  http://freepages.family.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jacklee/Files/19950424-ST-BadNewsforAllEngPurists.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there have been recent surges in interest in Singlish usage, sparking several national conversations. In 2016, [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED) announced that it has added 19 new "Singapore English" items such as "ang moh", "shiok" and "sabo" in both its online and printed versions. Several Singlish words had previously made it into the OED's online version, which launched in March 2000. Words such as "Lah" and "sinseh" were already included in OED's debut, while "kiasu" made it into the online list in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/shiok-19-singlish-items-added-to-the-oxford-english-dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Local celebrities were generally pleased for this Singaporean identity to be recognized on a global level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | access-date=5 Nov 2018 | url=http://www.asiaone.com/singapore/some-find-new-singlish-terms-oxford-dictionary-ridiculous | title=Some find new Singlish terms in Oxford dictionary 'ridiculous' | publisher=AsiaOne | date=13 May 2016 | last=ABDUL RAHMAN | first=NOOR ASHIKIN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vocabulary of Singlish consists of words originating from [[English language|English]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Hokkien]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and to a lesser extent various other European, [[Languages of India|Indic]] and [[Sinitic languages]]. Also, elements of [[Regional vocabularies of American English|American]] and [[Australian slang]] have come through from imported television series and films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Breitkreutz|first1=Peter|title=SINGLISH - A Language Guide for Foreigners|url=http://www.aussiepete.com/2008/05/singlish-language-guide-for-foreigners.html|publisher=Aussie Pete|accessdate=29 May 2015|quote=Singlish vocabulary formally takes after British English (in terms of spelling and abbreviations), although naming conventions are in a mix of American and British ones (with American ones on the rise). For instance, local media have "sports pages" (sport in British English) and "soccer coverage" (the use of the word "soccer" is not common in British media). Singlish also uses many words borrowed from Hokkien, the Chinese variety native to more than 75% of the Chinese in Singapore, and from Malay. In many cases, English words take on the meaning of their Chinese counterparts, resulting in a shift in meaning. This is most obvious in such cases as "borrow"/"lend", which are functionally equivalent in Singlish and mapped to the same Mandarin word, "借" (jiè), which can mean to lend or to borrow. For example: "Oi, can I lend your calculator?" / "Can lend me your calculator?" This is technically incorrect in standard English but is widely used in Singlish.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|2}}

==Overview and history==
Singapore English derives its roots from 146 years (1819–1965) of British colonial rule over Singapore.  Prior to 1967 the standard form of English in Singapore had always been [[British English]] and [[Received Pronunciation]].  After Singapore declared independence in 1965, English in Singapore began to take a life of its own, leading to the development of modern-day [[Standard Singapore English]]. At the same time, Singlish evolved among the working classes who learned English without formal schooling.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Singlish originated with the arrival of the British and the establishment of [[English language]] schools in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, Anthea Fraser (1994) ''The Step-tongue: Children's English in Singapore'', Clevedon, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, [[English language|English]] filtered out of schools and onto the streets, to be picked up by non-English-speakers in a [[pidgin]]-like form for communication purposes. After some time, this new form of English, now loaded with substantial influences from [[Indian English]], [[Peranakan|Baba]], native [[Bahasa Melayu|Malay]], and the southern varieties of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], became the language of the streets and began to be learned as a first language in its own right.&lt;ref name=bbcsinglish&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-33809914|title=The rise of Singlish|first=Tessa|last=Wong|date=6 August 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creole language|Creolization]] occurred, and Singlish is now a fully formed, stabilised, and independent English-based creole language.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Singlish shares many linguistic similarities with [[Manglish]] of [[Malaysia]], although a few distinctions can be made, particularly in vocabulary. [[Manglish]]  generally now receives more Malay influence and Singlish more Chinese (Mandarin, Hokkien, etc.) influence.
Initially, Singlish and [[Manglish]] were essentially the same dialect evolving from the [[British Malaya]] economy, born in the trading ports of Singapore, Malacca and [[Penang]] &lt;ref&gt;Tongue, R. K. (1979) ''The English of Singapore and Malaysia'' (second edition), Singapore: Eastern Universities Press, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; when Singapore and [[peninsular Malaysia]] were for many purposes a ''de facto'' single entity.

In Singapore, English was the language of administration, which the British used, with the assistance of English-educated Straits-born Chinese, to control the administration in Malaya and governance of trading routes such as the British East Indies spice routes with China, Japan, Europe and America in those ports and colonies of Singapore, Malacca and [[Penang]] through the colonial governing seat in [[Singapore]].

In British Malaya, English was the language of the British administration, whilst Malay was spoken as the lingua franca of the streets, as the British did not wish to antagonise the native Malays.

In British Singapore, however, as the seat of the colonial government and international commerce, English was both the language of administration and the lingua franca.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In Malaya, the Chinese varieties themselves also contained many loan-words from Malay, and more Chinese loan-words from the Hokkien, rather than the Cantonese. For example, Hokkien-influenced ''pa sat'' instead of the Cantonese-influenced ''baa saak'' in Singapore (from Malay ''pasar'' meaning 'market'), ''loti'' (from Malay ''roti'' meaning 'bread'), Hokkien ''gu li'' and ''jam bban'' (from Malay ''guli'' meaning 'marble', and Malay 'jamban' meaning toilet).

[[File:Quadrilingual danger sign - Singapore (gabbe).jpg|thumb|300px|right|Many signs in Singapore include all four official languages: [[English language|English]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malay language|Malay]].]]

After Singapore's independence in 1965, and successive [[Speak Mandarin Campaign|"Speak Mandarin" campaigns]],&lt;ref&gt;Gopinathan, S. (1998) "Language policy changes 1979–1997: Politics and pedagogy", in S. Gopinathan, Anne Pakir, Ho Wah Kam and Vanithamani Saravanan (eds.), ''Language, Society and Education in Singapore'' (2nd edn.), Singapore: Times Academic Press, pp. 19–44.&lt;/ref&gt; a subtle language shift among the post-1965 generation became more and more evident as Malay idiomatic expressions were, and continued to be, displaced by idioms borrowed from Chinese spoken varieties, such as [[Min Nan|Hokkien]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Sociolect continuum==
''
The English language in Singapore is a [[sociolect]] continuum.&lt;ref&gt;Platt, John T. (1975) "The Singapore English Speech Continuum and Its Basilect 'Singlish' as a 'Creoloid'", ''Anthropological Linguistics'', 17(7), 363–374.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[post-creole speech continuum|continuum]] runs through the following varieties:

'''[[Acrolect]]al''': Acrolectal Singaporean English exhibits an absence of or a much smaller degree of Singlish pronunciation features than do Mesolectal, Basilectal, and pidgin variants of Singlish. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

'''[[Mesolect]]al''': This is the most commonly spoken form of Singlish. It is a mix between [[Standard English]] and Singlish. At this level, a number of features not found in other forms of English begin to emerge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

'''[[Basilect]]al''': This is the most colloquial form of speech.&lt;ref&gt;Pakir, Anne (1991) "The range and depth of English-knowing bilinguals in Singapore", ''World Englishes'', 10(2), 167–179.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, one can find all of the unique [[phonology|phonological]], lexical, and [[grammar|grammatical]] features of Singlish. Many of these features can be attributed to Asian languages such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Malay language|Malay]], or Indian languages such as [[Tamil language|Tamil]], though some cannot. Both the basilect and mesolect are referred to as "Singlish".

'''[[Pidgin]]''': This is the "pidgin" level of Singlish, which is probably a good representative of an earlier stage of Singlish, before [[Creole language|creolisation]] took place and solidified Singlish as a fully formed creole. As with all [[pidgin]]s, speakers at the pidgin level speak another language as a first language, and Singlish as a second language. However, since a substantial number of people today learn Singlish natively, the number of speakers at the "pidgin" level of Singlish is dwindling.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, Anthea Fraser (1992) "Contact features of Singapore Colloquial English". In Kingsley Bolton and Helen Kwok (eds.) ''Sociolinguistics Today: International Perspectives'', London and New York: Routledge, pp. 323-345.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because by definition, a [[pidgin]] is not learned natively.

The coexistence of basilectal Singlish and acrolectal [[Standard Singapore English]] can also be analysed as a [[diglossia]], which is a split between a "high" formal language and a "low" informal language.

'''The Sociolect Continuum of Singaporean English'''&lt;br /&gt;Each of the following means the same thing, but the basilectal and mesolectal versions incorporate some colloquial additions for illustrative purposes.

Since many Singaporeans can speak English at multiple points along the sociolect spectrum, code-switching can occur very frequently between the acrolect ([[Standard Singapore English]]) and the mesolect (common Singlish). In addition, as many Singaporeans are also speakers of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Malay language|Malay]], or Indian languages such as [[Tamil language|Tamil]], code-switching between English and other languages also occurs dynamically.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

For example, a local Singaporean might speak in a Singlish consisting of English, Hokkien, Malay and Indian loan-words, when chatting with their friends.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Usage in society===

Singlish is commonly regarded with low prestige in Singapore. For this reason, Singlish is not used in formal communication. [[Standard Singapore English]] is preferred by many educated Singaporeans.&lt;ref name=bbcsinglish/&gt;

Due to its origins, Singlish shares many similarities with [[pidgin]] varieties of English, and can easily give the impression of "broken English" or "bad English" to a speaker of some other, less divergent variety of English. In addition, the profusion of Singlish features, especially [[loanword]]s from Asian languages, [[Grammatical mood|mood]] [[Grammatical particle|particles]], and [[Topic-prominent language|topic-prominent]] structure, can easily make Singlish incomprehensible to a speaker of Standard English. As a result, the use of Singlish is greatly frowned on by the government, and two former prime ministers, [[Lee Kuan Yew]] and [[Goh Chok Tong]], have publicly declared&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (2007) ''Singapore English'', Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, pp. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt; that Singlish is a substandard English that handicaps Singaporeans, presents an obstacle to learning proper English and renders the speaker incomprehensible to everyone except another Singlish speaker.

Current prime minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] has also said that Singlish should not be part of Singapore's identity.&lt;ref name="Jeremy Au Young"&gt;{{cite news|title=Singlish? Don't make it part of Spore identity: PM |work=The Straits Times |date=2007-09-22 |author=Jeremy Au Young |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/STIStory_160322.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interests of promoting equality and better communication with the rest of the world, in 2000 the government launched the [[Speak Good English Movement]] to eradicate it,&lt;ref&gt;Rubdy, Rani (2001) "Creative destruction: Singapore English's Speak Good English movement", ''World Englishes'', 20(3), 341–355.&lt;/ref&gt; at least from formal usage. The [[Media Development Authority]]'s free-to-air TV code states that the use of Singlish "should not be encouraged and can only be permitted in interviews, where only the interviewee speaks Singlish."&lt;ref name="tvcode"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mda.gov.sg/wms.file/mobj/mobj.612.fta_tv_prog_code.pdf|title=IMDA Singapore - Redirect Page|website=www.mda.gov.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, in recent years the use of Singlish on television and radio has proliferated as localised Singlish continues to be popular among Singaporeans, especially in comedies, such as [[Phua Chu Kang]].&lt;ref name=bbcsinglish/&gt;

In 2016, then Prime Minister Lee Hsieen Loong's press secretary wrote in a rebuttal to a New York Times opinion piece by Singaporean poet and literary critic Gwee Li Sui, to reinforce the government's policy against Singlish - Standard English continues to be viewed as vital for its citizens to earn a living and be understood by fellow English speakers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/nyt-op-ed-on-singlish-makes-light-of-efforts-to-promote-standard-8008464|title=NYT op-ed on Singlish makes light of efforts to promote standard English: PM's press secretary|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singlish is strongly discouraged in [[Education in Singapore|Singaporean schools]] at a governmental level as it is believed to hinder the proper learning of Standard English, and so faces a situation of [[diglossia]].&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (1998) 'Approaches to Diglossia in the Classroom: The Middle Way. REACT, 2, 18-23.' [http://videoweb.nie.edu.sg/phonetic/papers/diglossia.html (on-line version)]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Singlish when speaking in classes or to teachers, however officially frowned upon, is rather inevitable given that many teachers themselves are comfortable with the variety.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Joseph (2001) "Is English a first or second language in Singapore?", in Vincent B. Y. Ooi (ed.), ''Evolving Identities: The English Language in Singapore and Malaysia'', Singapore: Times Academic Press, pp. 12-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most workplaces, Singlish is avoided in formal settings, especially at job interviews, meetings with clients, presentations or meetings. Standard Singapore English is preferred. Nevertheless, select Singlish phrases are sometimes injected into discussions to build rapport or for a humorous effect, especially when the audience consists mainly of locals, but more recent Speak Good English campaigns are conducted with tacit acceptance of Singlish as a valid patois.&lt;ref name=bbcsinglish/&gt; 

In informal settings, such as during conversation with friends, or transactions in [[kopi tiam]]s and shopping malls, Singlish is used without restriction. For many students, using Singlish is inevitable when interacting with their peers, siblings, parents and elders.&lt;ref name=bbcsinglish/&gt;

Singapore humour writer [[Sylvia Toh Paik Choo]] was the first to put a spelling and a punctuation to Singlish in her books ''Eh Goondu'' (1982) and ''Lagi Goondu'' (1986), which are essentially a glossary of Singlish, which she terms 'Pasar Patois'. This is later followed by publishing of a few other Singlish books including ''Coxford Singlish Dictionary'' (2002) by [[Colin Goh]], ''An Essential Guide to Singlish'' (2003) by Miel and ''The Three Little Pigs Lah'' (2013) by [[Casey Chen]], and ''Spiaking Singlish: A companion to how Singaporeans Communicate'' (2017) by [[Gwee Li Sui]].

In recent times, Singlish is considered to be a fascinating language with its own systematic grammar. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160919-the-language-the-government-tried-to-suppress|title=The language the government tried to suppress|last=Harbeck|first=James|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists from universities around the world have referred to local productions to demonstrate to students how Singlish has become a unique variety of the English language. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefinder.com.sg/healthy-living/ask-the-experts/singlish-being-studied-universities-around-world-leh/|title=Singlish Is Being Studied In Universities Around The World, Leh! - The Finder|date=2017-02-06|work=The Finder|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==

===Background===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2008}}
Singlish [[pronunciation]], while built on a base of [[British English]], is heavily influenced by Native Malay, Hokkien and Cantonese.

There are variations within Singlish, both geographically and ethnically. Chinese, Native Malays, Indians, Eurasians, and other ethnic groups in Singapore all have distinct accents.

All of these communities were formed by the earliest immigrants to Singapore and thus have been British subjects for three or more generations. Thus, they have received no other "native education" than solely British colonial education. Especially for those born before 1965, all the education received has been direct English rather than British influences. Many of the East Coast communities were descendants or in other ways, privileged to be granted British colonial education similar to those in Britain. As such the [[acrolect]]al standard of English does not diverge substantially from the acrolectal standard in Britain at this time, though (as in other colonial outposts) it always tended to be somewhat "out of date" compared with contemporary speech patterns in Britain.

The English-educated in Singapore received their English pedagogical instruction through missionary schools and convents such as the [[Anglo-Chinese School]] (ACS), [[Methodist Girls' School, Singapore|Methodist Girls' School]] (MGS), Marymount Convent School, [[Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus]] (CHIJ), Canossa's Convent (Located in Aljunied). However, as decolonisation occurred, many expatriate English returned to Britain; Hence, in an unregulated socio-linguistic environment, the spontaneous varieties of a creolised English began to form after the 1960s.

In the East Coast, the teaching professions, especially teaching English, was a popular option in the European, Eurasian, Peranakan and Chinese communities who descended from privileged colonial Civil Service families for the Queen's Crown, from the beginning of the last century up till the 1970s. From the 1970s onwards, the permanent decolonisation meant that the original Queen's English taught began to experience deformation and modification from other languages. As a result, whole generations of school-children in the Siglap/Katong districts were taught English with an "English-ed", modified Queen's English accent minimally influenced by Eurasian, Peranakan and Hokkien Chinese intonation. Their Siglap/Katong accent, though not a pure form of Queen's English, is considered to be the prestigious variant of English in Singapore.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Because that area has also tended to supply the ruling and civil service classes, many uneducated immigrant Chinese, Native Malay and Indian (new Tamil immigrants) who are trapped in the lower rungs of the social scale, often mock and ridicule this "un-modern" and "foreign-sounding" English. With the rise of the consumerist and mass middle-class, second-generation immigrants of humble origins have begun to deliberately deform taught acrolectal English for street pidgin patois as a form of identity-creation, self-actualisation and self-determination.

Prominent members of society still speak the acrolectal [[Queen's English]] in formal situations including  [[Benjamin Sheares]], [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]], Harry [[Lee Kuan Yew]], Lee Siew Chow, [[Francis Seow]] and other affluent descendants of the East Coast communities.

However, after 1965, with colonial attitudes being unpopular politically, a new "culture-free" English was promoted through the usages of television presenters in the former SBC (Singapore Broadcasting Corporation), through to its renaming as TCS (Television Corporation of Singapore) and to the current MediaCorp. This post-1965 accent is sometimes known as the "Channel 5 accent", so named after the English channel owned by the State media group.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} This gave rise to a new standard of artificially constructed but standardised acrolectal English for Singapore that did not equate to [[Received Pronunciation]] in Britain but corresponded to the latter's social function and status within the new Singaporean national context due to state monopoly, censorship and control over media in this early stage of Singaporean national politics. Despite this, the more affluent English-educated classes continued to support the original Christian missionary and Convent schools financially to stem the degradation of English language instruction.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Despite all attempts, the English language in Singapore began to naturally creolise. The post-1965 English-educated accent is hence different from that of the pre-1965 "English-ed accent". For example, PM Lee Hsien Loong and Lee Hsien Yang, sons of the political figure Lee Kuan Yew, do not speak their father's [[Queen's English]]. The pure English diphthongs in words like "home", the liaison in pronunciation of "r" at the end of words ending with "r" followed by a word beginning with a vowel (such as "ever emerging", pronounced in [[Queen's English]] as "eveR emerging" does not occur. Instead, diphthongs are converted into simplified vowels, and elements of Chinese, Malay and other accents and influences begin to exert itself on the evolving acrolect.

Parallel to this, British economic, political and linguistic influence began to decline starkly throughout the world as colonies gained independence, such as India, while the United States of America rose as a superpower and American English largely took over as the international economic and [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|cultural prestige]] variant. This change became more pervasive with the rise of Hollywood and American popular culture. As such, even among the "English-educated classes", the type and use of English shifted again as more affluent families, scholarship boards and charities sent the youth to boarding schools, colleges and universities in the United States over the United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Many more Singaporeans then began to be born abroad to a jetsetting English-ed class and descendants of the ex-Civil Service class for left for higher-paying education, legal and corporate positions in the United States, Canada, or the United Kingdom, and a huge middle-class segment to Australia and New Zealand. As such, the English-educated class born after 1965 do not speak the Queen's English any more, nor do they hold the "Channel 5 accent" as a standard, reverting between the prestige variant of the countries they received schooling in, and the bourgeois patois for familiarity. As such, the English accent in Singapore has become an international hybrid similar to that of affluent families in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Taipei and Tokyo.

When unemployment rose during the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, Singlish came under official attack as undermining an economic competitiveness factor – English language fluency.

In general:
* The [[Dental consonant|dental]] [[fricative]]s{{spaced ndash}}{{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}}{{spaced ndash}}merge with {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}, so that '''three''' = '''tree''' and '''then''' = '''den'''.&lt;ref name="Bao Zhiming 1998 pp. 152-174"&gt;Bao Zhiming (1998) 'The sounds of Singapore English'. In J. A. Foley et al. (eds.) ''English in New Cultural Contexts: Reflections from Singapore'', Singapore: Singapore Institute of Management/Oxford University Press, pp. 152-174.&lt;/ref&gt; In syllable-final position, '''-th''' is pronounced as '''-f''' {{IPA|/f/}}, so '''with''' and '''birth''' are pronounced ''weeff'' {{IPA|/wif/}} and ''bəff'' {{IPA|/bəf/}} respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (2007). ''Singapore English'', Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of '''with''', '''without''' is often pronounced with {{IPA|/v/}} in place of {{IPA|/ð/}}: {{IPA|/wivaut/}}. The dental fricatives do occur in acrolectal speech, though even among educated speakers there is some variation.&lt;ref&gt;Moorthy, Shanti Marion and Deterding, David (2000) 'Three or tree? Dental fricatives in the speech of educated Singaporeans.' In Adam Brown, David Deterding and Low Ee Ling (Eds.), ''The English Language in Singapore: Research on Pronunciation'', Singapore: Singapore Association for Applied Linguistics, pp. 76-83.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The voiceless stops{{spaced ndash}}{{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}{{spaced ndash}}are sometimes [[unaspirated]],&lt;ref name="Bao Zhiming 1998 pp. 152-174"/&gt; especially among Malays.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David and Poedjosoedarmo, Gloria (1998) ''The Sounds of English: Phonetics and Phonology for English Teachers in Southeast Asia'', Singapore: Prentice Hall, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Aspiration (phonetics)|Aspiration]] refers to the strong puff of air that may accompany the release of these stop consonants.)  The acoustic effect of this is that the Singlish pronunciation of '''p'''at, '''t'''in and '''c'''ome sound more similar to '''bat''', '''din''', and '''gum''' than in other varieties of English.
* While it may be believed that the distinction between {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} is not stable at the basilectal level, as TV personality [[Phua Chu Kang]]'s oft-repeated refrain to "''Use your blain!''" (use your brain) and "'Don pray pray!'" (Don't play-play, i.e. Don't fool around) may seem to indicate. It is more of a self-depreciating, rather self-aware joke, like "died-ed". One might note, however, that both these examples involve initial consonant clusters ({{IPA|/bl}}/ and {{IPA|/pl/}} respectively), and conflation of {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} is found less often when they are not part of a cluster.
* {{IPA|/l/}} at the end of a syllable, pronounced as a velarised "[[Velarised alveolar lateral approximant|dark l]]" in British or American English, is often so velarised in Singlish that it approaches the [[Close-mid back unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[ɤ]}}, e.g. '''sale''' {{IPA|[seɤ]}}. {{IPA|/l/}} also tends to be lost after the back vowels {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, and for some basilectal speakers, the central vowel {{IPA|/ə/}}. Hence '''pall''' = '''paw''' {{IPA|/pɔ/}}, '''roll''' = '''row''' {{IPA|/ro/}}, '''tool''' = '''two''' {{IPA|/tu/}}, and for some, '''pearl''' = '''per''' {{IPA|/pə/}}&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Kah Keong (2005) 'Vocalisation of {{IPA|/l/}} in Singapore English'. In David Deterding, Adam Brown and Low Ee Ling (eds.) ''English in Singapore: Phonetic Research on a Corpus'', Singapore: McGraw-Hill Education (Asia), pp. 43-53.&lt;/ref&gt;
* With some accents in Singapore, {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}}, when at the end of words such as '''will''' or '''or''', will be replaced with {{IPA|[ɤ]}}. Hence {{IPA|/wiɤ/}} or {{IPA|/ɔɤ/}}
* Syllabic consonants never occur. Hence '''taken''' {{IPA|[tekən]}} and '''battle''' {{IPA|[bɛtəɤ]}}, never {{IPA|[tekn̩]}} or {{IPA|[bɛtl̩]}}. When the final {{IPA|/l/}} is vocalised, '''little''' and '''litter''' may be homophones.&lt;ref&gt;Low, Ee Ling and Brown, Adam (2005) ''English in Singapore: An Introduction'', Singapore: McGraw-Hill, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, the [[glottal stop]], is inserted at the beginning of all words starting with a vowel, similar to [[German pronunciation|German]]. As a result, final consonants do not experience [[liaison (linguistics)|liaison]], i.e. run onto the next word. For example, "run out of eggs" would be very roughly "run-'''n'''out-'''t'''o-'''v'''eggs" in most dialects of English (e.g. {{IPA|[rʌn‿aʊɾ‿əv‿ɛɡz]}} in General American), but "run 'out 'of 'eggs" (e.g. {{IPA|[ran ʔau ʔɔf ʔeks]}}) in Singlish. This contributes to what some have described as the 'staccato effect' of Singapore English.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Adam (1988) 'The staccato effect in the pronunciation of English in Malaysia and Singapore', in Foley (ed.) ''New Englishes: the Case of Singapore'', Singapore: Singapore University Press.pp. 115–28.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|[ʔ]}} replaces final plosive consonants of [[syllable]]s in regular- to fast-paced speed speech, especially [[stop consonant|stops]]: '''Goodwood Park''' becomes '''Gu'-wu' Pa' ''' {{IPA|/ɡuʔ wuʔ paʔ/}}, and there may be a glottal stop at the end of words such as '''back''' and '''out'''. Like in Cambodian, where a final 'g' becomes a 'k'; 'bad' becomes 'bat' with an unaspirated 't'.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Adam and Deterding, David (2005) 'A checklist of Singapore English pronunciation features'. In David Deterding, Adam Brown and Low Ee Ling (eds.) ''English in Singapore: Phonetic Research on a Corpus'', Singapore: McGraw-Hill Education (Asia), pp. 7-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In final position, the distinction between voiced and voiceless sounds{{spaced ndash}}i.e. {{IPA|/s/}} &amp; {{IPA|/z/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} &amp; {{IPA|/d/}}, etc.{{spaced ndash}}is usually not maintained. As a result, '''cease''' = '''seize''' {{IPA|/sis/}} and '''race''' = '''raise''' {{IPA|/res/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (2005) 'Emergent patterns in the vowels of Singapore English', ''English World-Wide'', 26(2), 179–197.&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to some mergers of noun/verb pairs, such as '''belief''' with '''believe''' {{IPA|/bilif/}}.
* Final consonant clusters simplify, especially in fast speech.&lt;ref&gt;Gut, Ulrike (2005) 'The realisation of final plosives in Singapore English: phonological rules and ethnic differences'. In David Deterding, Adam Brown and Low Ee Ling (eds.), ''English in Singapore: Phonetic Research on a Corpus'', Singapore: McGraw-Hill Education (Asia), pp. 14–25.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, [[plosive]]s, especially {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}, are lost if they come after another consonant: '''bent''' = '''Ben''' {{IPA|/bɛn/}}, '''tact''' = '''tack''' {{IPA|/tɛk/}}, '''nest''' = '''Ness''' {{IPA|/nɛs/}}. {{IPA|/s/}} is also commonly lost at the end of a consonant cluster: '''relax''' = '''relac''' {{IPA|/rilɛk/}}.

===Vowels===

Broadly speaking, there is a one-to-many mapping of Singlish vowel [[phoneme]]s to British [[Received Pronunciation]] vowel phonemes, with a few exceptions (as discussed below, with regard to ''egg'' and ''peg''). The following describes a typical system.&lt;ref name="Bao Zhiming 1998 pp. 152-174"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David and Poedjosoedarmo, Gloria (1998) ''The Sounds of English: Phonetics and Phonology for English Teachers in Southeast Asia'', Singapore: Prentice Hall, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (2003) 'An instrumental study of the monophthong vowels of Singapore English', ''English World Wide''; 24(1), 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt; There is generally no distinction between the non-close front monophthongs, so '''pet''' and '''pat''' are pronounced the same {{IPA|/pɛt/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanna Bet Hashim and Brown, Adam (2000) 'The [e] and [æ] vowels in Singapore English'. In Adam Brown, David Deterding and Low Ee Ling (eds.) ''The English Language in Singapore: Research on Pronunciation'', Singapore: Singapore Association for Applied Linguistics, pp. 84-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the acrolectal level, the merged vowel [[phoneme]]s are distinguished to some extent. These speakers may make a distinction between the tense vowels {{IPA|/i, u/}} ({{sc2|FLEECE, GOOSE}}) and the lax vowels {{IPA|/ɪ, ʊ/}} ({{sc2|KIT, FOOT}}) respectively. For some speakers elements from [[American English]] are introduced, such as pre-consonantal [r] (pronouncing the "r" in bi'''r'''d, po'''r'''t, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Poedjosoedarmo, Gloria (2000) 'The media as a model and source of innovation in the development of Singapore Standard English’. In Adam Brown, David Deterding and Low Ee Ling (eds.), ''The English Language in Singapore: Research on Pronunciation'', Singapore: Singapore Association for Applied Linguistics, pp. 112–120.&lt;/ref&gt; This is caused by the popularity of American TV programming.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Current estimates are that about 20 per cent of university undergraduates sometimes use this American-style pre-consonantal [r] when reading a passage.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (2007). 'The Vowels of the Different Ethnic Groups in Singapore'. In David Prescott (ed.fg), ''English in Southeast Asia: Literacies, Literatures and Varieties''.

* {{IPA|/ɛ/}} remains {{IPA|/ɛ/}} in Singlish, except when followed by a voiced plosive (/b/, /d/, or /g/), in which case it becomes {{IPA|/e/}} among some speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Tay Wan Joo, Mary (1982) 'The phonology of educated Singapore English', ''English World-Wide'', 3(2), 135–45.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not entirely predictable, as '''egg''' has a close vowel (so it rhymes with '''vague''') while '''peg''' has an open vowel (and rhymes with '''tag'''); and similarly for most speakers '''bed''' has a close vowel (so it rhymes with '''made'''), while '''fed''' has a more open vowel (the same vowel as in '''bad''').&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (2005) 'Emergent patterns in the vowels of Singapore English', ''English World-Wide'', 26(2), 179–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Which vowel occurs in each word therefore appears in these cases not to be predictable.
* {{IPA|/ai/}} remains {{IPA|/ai/}} in Singlish, except when followed by /l/, in which case it is the monophthong {{IPA|/a/}}.
* Examples of words have idiosyncratic pronunciations: '''flour''' {{IPA|/fla/}} (expected: {{IPA|/flau.ə/}} = '''flower'''),;&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Siew Siew and Low, Ee Ling (2005) 'Triphthongs in Singapore English'. In David Deterding, Adam Brown and Low Ee Ling (eds.) ''English in Singapore: Phonetic Research on a Corpus'', Singapore: McGraw-Hill Education (Asia), pp. 64–73.&lt;/ref&gt; and '''their''' {{IPA|/dja/}} (expected: {{IPA|/dɛ/}} = '''there'''). Flour/flower and their/there are therefore not homophones in Singlish. This also applies to [[Manglish]].
* In general, Singlish vowels are tenser{{spaced ndash}}there are no lax vowels (which RP has in '''pit''', '''put''', and so forth).
* The vowels in words such as '''day''' /de/ and '''low''' /lo/ are pronounced with less glide than the comparable [[diphthong]]s in RP, so they can be regarded as [[monophthong]]s{{spaced ndash}}i.e. vowels with no glide.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (2000) 'Measurements of the {{IPA|/eɪ/}} and {{IPA|/oʊ/}} vowels of young English speakers in Singapore'. In Adam Brown, David Deterding and Low Ee Ling (eds.), ''The English Language in Singapore: Research on Pronunciation'', Singapore: Singapore Association for Applied Linguistics, pp. 93-99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Ee May and Lim, Lisa (2000) ' Diphthongs in Singaporean English: their realisations across different formality levels, and some attitudes of listeners towards them. In Adam Brown, David Deterding and Low Ee Ling (eds.), ''The English Language in Singapore: Research on Pronunciation'', Singapore: Singapore Association for Applied Linguistics, pp. 100-111.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Where other varieties of English have an unstressed {{IPA|/ə/}}, i.e. a reduced vowel, Singlish tends to use the full vowel based on orthography. This can be seen in words such as '''a'''ccept {{IPA|/ɛksɛp/}}, '''e'''xample {{IPA|/ɛ(k)sampəl/}}, purch'''a'''se {{IPA|/pətʃes/}}, maint'''e'''nance {{IPA|/mentɛnəns/}}, pr'''e'''s'''e'''ntation {{IPA|/prisɛnteʃən/}}, and so on. However, this does not mean that the reduced vowel {{IPA|/ə/}} never occurs, as '''about''' and '''again''' have {{IPA|/ə/}} in their first syllable. It seems that the letter 'a' is often pronounced {{IPA|/ə/}}, but the letter 'o' usually has a full vowel quality, especially in the '''con''' prefix ('''control''', '''consider''', etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Heng, Mui Gek and Deterding, David (2005) 'Reduced vowels in conversational Singapore English'. In David Deterding, Adam Brown and Low Ee Ling (eds.) ''English in Singapore: Phonetic Research on a Corpus'', Singapore: McGraw-Hill Education (Asia), pp. 54–63.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a greater tendency to use a full vowel in a syllable which is closed off with a final consonant, so a full vowel is much more likely at the start of '''ab'''sorb {{IPA|/ɛbzɔb/}} than '''a'''fford {{IPA|/əfɔd/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (2006) 'Reduced vowels in SE Asia: should we be teaching them?', ''SOUTHEAST ASIA: A Multidisciplinary Journal'', 6 (1), 71-78.[http://videoweb.nie.edu.sg/phonetic/papers/red-vowels-in-se-asia.pdf (on-line version)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In loanwords from [[Min Nan|Hokkien]] that contain [[nasal vowel]]s, the nasalisation is often kept{{spaced ndash}}one prominent example being the [[Grammatical mood|mood]] [[Grammatical particle|particle]] '''hor''', pronounced {{IPA-nan|hõ}}.

===Tones===

Singlish is semi-tonal as all words of Chinese origin retain their original tones in Singlish. On the other hand, original English words as well as words of Malay and Tamil origin are non-tonal.

===Prosody===

One of the most prominent and noticeable features of Singlish is its unique intonation pattern, which is quite unlike [[British English|British]], [[American English|American]] or [[Australian English]], etc.&lt;ref name="Deterding, David 1994"&gt;Deterding, David (1994) 'The intonation of Singapore English', ''Journal of the International Phonetic Association'', 24(2), 61–72.&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
* Singlish is [[Timing (linguistics)|syllable-timed]] compared to most traditional varieties of English, which are usually stress-timed.&lt;ref&gt;Low Ee Ling, Grabe, Esther and Nolan, Francis (2000) 'Quantitative characterisations of speech rhythm: syllable-timing in Singapore English', ''Language and Speech'', 43, 377–401.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (2001) 'The Measurement of Rhythm: A Comparison of Singapore and British English', ''Journal of Phonetics'', 29 (2), 217–230.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ong Po Keng, Fiona, Deterding, David and Low Ee Ling (2007) 'Rhythm in Singapore and British English: a comparison of indexes'. In David Deterding, Adam Brown and Low Ee Ling (eds. 2005), ''English in Singapore: Phonetic Research on a Corpus, Singapore: McGraw-Hill Education (Asia)'', pp. 74–85.&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn gives Singlish rather a [[staccato]] feel.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Adam (1988) 'The staccato effect in the pronunciation of English in Malaysia and Singapore'. In Foley (ed.) ''New Englishes: the Case of Singapore'', Singapore: Singapore University Press, pp. 115–128.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is a tendency to use a rise-fall tone to indicate special emphasis.&lt;ref name="Deterding, David 1994"/&gt; A rise-fall tone can occur quite often on the final word of an utterance, for example on the word '''cycle''' in "I will try to go to the park to cycle" without carrying any of the suggestive meaning associated with a rise-fall tone in British English.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (2007) ''Singapore English'', Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, a rise-fall tone may be found on as many as 21 per cent of declaratives, and this use of the tone can convey a sense of strong approval or disapproval.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Lisa (2004) 'Sounding Singaporean'. In Lisa Lim (ed.) ''Singapore English: A Grammatical Description'', Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 20-56.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is a lack of the de-accenting that is found in most dialects of English (e.g. British and American), so information that is repeated or predictable is still given full prominence.&lt;ref&gt;Levis, John M. (2005) 'Prominence in Singapore and American English: evidence from reading aloud'. In David Deterding, Adam Brown and Low Ee Ling (eds. 2005), ''English in Singapore: Phonetic Research on a Corpus, Singapore: McGraw-Hill Education (Asia)'', pp. 86–94.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is often an 'early booster' at the start of an utterance,&lt;ref&gt;Low, Ee Ling (2000) 'A comparison of the pitch range of Singapore English and British English speakers'. In Adam Brown, David Deterding and Low Ee Ling (eds. 2000) ''The English Language in Singapore: Research on Pronunciation, Singapore: Singapore Association for Applied Linguistics'', pp. 46–52.&lt;/ref&gt; so an utterance like "I think they are quite nice and interesting magazines" may have a very high pitch occurring on the word '''think'''.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (2007) ''Singapore English'', Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Coxford Singlish Dictionary.jpg|thumb|150px|right|''Coxford Singlish Dictionary'', a published book on Singlish]]
* There may be greater movement over individual syllables in Singlish than in other varieties of English. This makes Singlish sound as if it has the [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] of Chinese, especially when speakers sometimes maintain the original tones of words that are borrowed into Singlish from Chinese.

Overall, the differences between the different ethnic communities in Singapore are most evident in the patterns of intonation, so for example Malay Singaporeans often have the main pitch excursion later in an utterance than ethnically Chinese and Indian Singaporeans.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Lisa (2000) 'Ethic group differences aligned? Intonation patterns of Chinese, Indian and Malay Singapore English'. In Adam Brown, David Deterding and Low Ee Ling (eds. 2000) ''The English Language in Singapore: Research on Pronunciation, Singapore: Singapore Association for Applied Linguistics'', pp. 10-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, these pronunciation patterns are thought to have increased the clarity of Singlish communications between pidgin-level speakers in often noisy environments, and these features were retained in creolisation.

==Grammar==

The grammar of Singlish has been heavily influenced by other languages in the region, such as [[Bahasa Melayu|Malay]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], with some structures being identical to ones in Mandarin and other Chinese varieties. As a result, Singlish has acquired some unique features, especially at the basilectal level. Note that all of the features described below disappear at the acrolectal level, as people in formal situations tend to adjust their speech towards accepted norms found in other varieties of English.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Topic prominence===

Singlish is [[Topic-prominent language|topic-prominent]], like [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. This means that Singlish sentences often begin with a topic (or a known reference of the conversation), followed by a comment (or new information)&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Ludwig (2003) 'Topic prominence and null arguments in Singapore Colloquial English'. In David Deterding, Low Ee Ling and Adam Brown (Eds.) English in Singapore: Research on Grammar, Singapore: Singapore Association for Applied Linguistics, pp. 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Ludwig (2007) Null Arguments in Singapore Colloquial English. Unpublished PhD thesis, University of Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leong, Alvin (2003) Subject omission in Singapore Colloquial English. In David Deterding, Low Ee Ling and Adam Brown (Eds.) English in Singapore: Research on Grammar, Singapore: Singapore Association for Applied Linguistics, pp. 11-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other varieties of English, the [[semantic]] relationship between topic and comment is not important; moreover, nouns, verbs, adverbs, and even entire subject-verb-object phrases can all serve as the topic:
* '''Dis country''' weather very hot one.{{spaced ndash}}''The weather is very warm in this country.''
* '''Dat joker there''' cannot trust.{{spaced ndash}}''You cannot trust the person over there.''
* '''Tomorrow''' don't need bring camera.{{spaced ndash}}''You don't need to bring a camera tomorrow.''
* '''He play football''' also very good one leh.{{spaced ndash}}''He's very good at playing football too.''
* '''Walau, I want to eat chicken rice''' – ''I am craving some chicken rice.''
* '''I go bus-stop wait for you''' – ''I will be waiting for you at the bus-stop.''
The above constructions can be translated analogously into [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], with little change to the word order.

The topic can be omitted when the context is clear, or shared between clauses. This results in constructions that appear to be missing a subject to a speaker of [[Dialects of English|most other varieties of English]], and so called PRO-drop utterances may be regarded as a diagnostic feature of Singapore Colloquial English (or 'Singlish').&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, Anthea Fraser (1994) ''The Step-tongue: Children's English in Singapore', Clevedon, UK: Multilingual Matters, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
* No good lah.{{spaced ndash}}''This isn't good.''
* Cannot anyhow go like dat one leh.{{spaced ndash}}''You/it can't just go like that.''
* How come never show up?{{spaced ndash}}''Why didn't you/he/it show up?'' (See the use of ''never'' in place of ''didn't'' under the "Past tense" section.)
* I like badminton, dat's why I every weekend go play.{{spaced ndash}}''I play badminton every weekend because I like it.''
* He sick, so he stay home sleep lor.{{spaced ndash}}''He's not feeling well, so he decided to rest at home and sleep!''

===Nouns===

Nouns are optionally marked for [[plural]]ity. [[article (grammar)|Articles]] are also optional.&lt;ref&gt;Wee, Lionel and Ansaldo, Umberto (2004) 'Nouns and noun phrases'. In Lisa Lim (ed.) ''Singapore English: A Grammatical Description'', Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 57-74.&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
* He can play '''piano'''.
* I like to read '''storybook'''.
* Your computer got '''virus''' or not?  ''– Does your computer have a virus?''
* This one ten '''cent''' only.  – ''This one only costs 10 cents.''

It is more common to mark the plural in the presence of a [[Grammatical modifier|modifier]] that implies plurality, such as "many" or "four".&lt;ref name="Alsagoff 1998 pp. 201-217"&gt;Alsagoff, Lubna and Ho, Chee Lick (1998) 'The grammar of Singapore English'. In J. A. Foley et al. (eds.) ''English in New Cultural Contexts: Reflections from Singapore'', Singapore: Singapore Institute of Management/Oxford University Press, pp. 201-217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many nouns which seem logically to refer to a countable item are used in the plural, including '''furniture''' and '''clothing'''.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Adam (1999) ''Singapore English in a Nutshell'', Singapore: Federal, pp. 62, 63&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this usage from corpus recordings are:
* So I bought a lot of furnitures from [[IKEA]]...
* Where are all the stuffs I ordered?
* I had to borrow some winter clothings&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (2007) ''Singapore English'', Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===To be===

The [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], which is the verb "to be" in most varieties of English, is treated somewhat differently in Singlish:

When occurring with an adjective or adjective phrase, the verb "to be" tends to be omitted:
* I damn naughty.&lt;ref name="Platt 1980 p. 31"&gt;Platt, John and Weber, Heidi (1980) ''English in Singapore and Malaysia: Status, Features, Functions'', Singapore: Oxford University Press, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, an adverb such as "very" occurs, and this is reminiscent of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] usage of the word "很" (hen3) or "好" (hao3):
* Dis house '''very''' nice.

It is also common for the verb "to be" to be omitted before the [[present participle]] of the verb:&lt;ref&gt;Fong, Vivienne (2004) 'The verbal cluster'. In Lisa Lim (ed.) ''Singapore English: A Grammatical Description", Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 75-104.&lt;/ref&gt;
* I still finding.&lt;ref name="Platt 1980 p. 31"/&gt;
* How come you so late still '''playing''' music, ah?
* You '''looking''' for trouble, is it?

Slightly less common is the dropping out of "to be" when used as an equative between two nouns, or as a [[locative]]:
* Dat one his wife lah. ("That lady is his wife.")&lt;ref&gt;Platt, John and Weber, Heidi (1980) ''English in Singapore and Malaysia: Status, Features, Functions'', Singapore: Oxford University Press, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dis boy the class monitor. (= a subset of the disciplinary system; a monitor is empowered to enforce discipline by being an informant in the absence of the teacher or superior authority figure but his/her authority is restricted to the class; this is unlike a prefect whose authority is house-wide or even school-wide)
* His house in [[Toa Payoh]]

In general, "to be" drops out more after nouns and pronouns (except "I", "he", and "she"), and much less after a [[clause]] (what I think is...) or a [[demonstrative]] (this is...).

===Past tense===

Past tense marking is optional in Singlish. Marking of the past tense occurs most often in [[Regular and irregular verbs|irregular verbs]], as well as verbs where the past tense suffix is pronounced {{IPA|/ɪd/}}.&lt;ref name="Platt 1980 p. 88"&gt;Platt, John and Weber, Heidi (1980) ''English in Singapore and Malaysia: Status, Features, Functions'', Singapore: Oxford University Press, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
* I '''went''' to Orchard Road yesterday.
* He '''accepted''' in the end.

Due to consonant cluster simplification, the past tense is most often unmarked when it is pronounced as /t/ or /d/ at the end of a [[consonant cluster]]:&lt;ref name="Platt 1980 p. 88"/&gt;
* He '''talk''' so long, never '''stop''', I '''ask''' him also never.

The past tense is more likely to be marked if the verb describes an isolated event (it is a punctual verb), and it tends to be unmarked if the verb in question represents an action that goes on for an extended period:&lt;ref&gt;Platt, John and Weber, Heidi (1980) ''English in Singapore and Malaysia: Status, Features, Functions'', Singapore: Oxford University Press, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
* When I young ah, I '''go''' school every day.
* When he was in school, he always '''get''' good marks one.
* Last night I '''mug''' so much, so sian already. (''to mug'' is to cram for an examination. ''[[Singlish vocabulary#S|sian]]'' is an adjective for "bored/tired".)

There seems also to be a tendency to avoid use of the past tense to refer to someone who is still alive:
* The tour guide '''speak''' Mandarin&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (2003) 'Tenses and will/would in a corpus of Singapore English'. In David Deterding, Low Ee Ling and Adam Brown (eds.) ''English in Singapore: Research on Grammar'', Singapore: McGraw-Hill Education (Asia), p 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note in the final example that although the speaker is narrating a story, she probably uses the present tense in the belief that the tour guide is probably still alive.—

===Change of state===

Instead of the past tense, a change of state can be expressed by adding ''already'' or ''liao'' ({{IPA|/liâu/}}) to the end of the sentence, analogous to [[Chinese language|Chinese]] 了 (''le'').&lt;ref&gt;Bao Zhiming, (1995) 'Already in Singapore English', ''World Englishes'', 14(2), 181-188.&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the same as the past tense, but more of an [[aspect (linguistics)|aspect]], as it does not cover past habitual or continuous occurrences, and it refers to a real or hypothetical change of state in the past, present or future.

The frequent use of '''already''' (pronounced more like "oreddy" and sometimes spelt that way) in Singapore English is probably a direct influence of the Hokkien ''liao'' particle.&lt;ref&gt;Alsagoff, Lubna (2001) 'Tense and aspect in Singapore English'. In Vincent B. Y. Ooi (ed.) ''Evolving Identities: The English Language in Singapore and Malaysia'', Singapore: Times Academic Press, pp. 79-88.&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
* Aiyah, cannot wait any more, must go '''already'''. (Oh dear, I cannot wait any longer. I must leave immediately.)
* Yesterday, dey go there '''already'''. (They already went there yesterday.)
* Ah Song kana sai '''already''', then how? (If Ah Song were to get in trouble, what would you do?)
** '''kana''' is a phonetical mispronunciation of "kena" by non-Malay speakers, which is itself a Malay word that may mean either "to (have) encounter(ed) something" or "to have to (do something)" (notes further below). '''Sai''' is a Hokkien word that means "feces", and figuratively it means trouble. So '''kana Sai''' means touched by trouble, or get into trouble.

Some examples of the direct use of the Hokkien particle are:
* He throw '''liao'''. (He has already thrown it away.)
* I eat '''liao'''. (I ate ''or'' I have eaten.)
* This new game, you play '''liao''' or not? (As for this new game, have you played it yet?)

===Negation===

Negation works in general like English, with '''not''' added after "to be", "to have", or [[modal verb|modals]], and '''don't''' before all other verbs. Contractions (can't, shouldn't) are used alongside their uncontracted forms.

However, due to final cluster simplification, the -t drops out from negative forms, and -n may also drop out after nasalising the previous vowel. This makes nasalisation the only mark of the negative.
* I do/don't ({{IPA|[dõ]}}) want.{{spaced ndash}}''I don't want to.''

Another effect of this is that in the verb "can", its positive and negative forms are distinguished only by [[vowel]]:
* This one can {{IPA|/kɛn/}} do lah.
* This one can't {{IPA|/kan/}} do lah.

Also, '''never''' is used as a negative past tense marker, and does not have to carry the English meaning. In this construction, the negated verb is never put into the past-tense form:
* How come today you '''never''' (=didn't) hand in homework?
* How come he '''never''' (=didn't) pay just now?

===Interrogative===

In addition to the usual{{which?|date=April 2016}} way of forming [[yes-no question]]s, Singlish uses two more constructions:

In a construction similar (but not identical) to [[Chinese language|Chinese]] A-not-A, '''or not''' is appended to the end of sentences to form yes/no questions. ''Or not'' cannot be used with sentences already in the negative:
* You want this book '''or not'''?{{spaced ndash}}''Do you want this book?''
* Can '''or not'''?{{spaced ndash}}''Is this possible / permissible?''

The phrase '''is it''', appended to the end of sentences, forms yes-no questions.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Adam (1999) ''Singapore English in a Nutshell'', Singapore: Federal, pp. 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generic like the [[French language|French]]'' n'est-ce pas?'' (''isn't it so?''), regardless of the actual verb in the sentence, and is strongly reminiscent of the Chinese "是吗" (shi4 ma) as well as of its frequent use amongst South Indian speakers of English. '''Is it''' implies that the speaker is simply confirming something he/she has already inferred:
* They never study, '''is it'''? (No wonder they failed!)
* You don't like that, '''is it'''? (No wonder you had that face!)
* Alamak, you guys never read newspaper '''is it'''?{{spaced ndash}}"What? Haven't you guys ever read a newspaper?" (No wonder you aren't up to date!)

The phrase '''isn't it''' also occurs when the speaker thinks the hearer might disagree with the assertion.&lt;ref name="Alsagoff 1998 pp. 201-217"/&gt;

There are also many discourse particles (such as '''hah''', '''hor''', '''meh''', and '''ar''') used in questions. (See the  [[#Discourse particles|"Discourse particles"]] section elsewhere in this article.)

===Reduplication===

Another feature strongly reminiscent of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Malay language|Malay]], verbs are often repeated (e.g., TV personality Phua Chu Kang's "don't pray-pray!" pray = play). In general verbs are repeated twice to indicate the delimitative aspect (that the action goes on for a short period), and three times to indicate greater length and continuity:&lt;ref&gt;Ansaldo, Umberto (2004) 'The evolution of Singapore English', in Lisa Lim (ed.) ''Singapore English: A Grammatical Description'', Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 127-149.&lt;/ref&gt;
* You go '''ting ting''' a little bit, maybe den you get answer. (Go and think over it for a while, and then you might understand.)
* So what I do was, I sit down and I '''ting ting ting''', until I get answer lor. (So I sat down, thought, thought and thought, until I understood.)

The use of verb repetition also serves to provide a more vivid description of an activity:
* Want to go Orchard '''walk walk see see''' (走走看看) or not? (Let's go shopping/sightseeing at Orchard Road.)
* Don't anyhow '''touch''' here '''touch''' there leh. (Please don't mess with my things.)

In another usage reminiscent of Chinese, [[noun]]s referring to people can be repeated for intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Wee, Lionel (2004) 'Reduplication and discourse particles', in Lisa Lim (ed.) ''Singapore English: A Grammatical Description'', Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 105-126.&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly, monosyllabic nouns are repeated:
* My '''boy-boy''' is going to Primary One oreddy. (My son is about to enter Year/Grade/Standard One.)
* We two '''fren-fren''' one. (We are close friends.)

However, occasionally reduplication is also found with bisyllabic nouns:
* We '''buddy-buddy'''. You don't play me out, OK?&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Choon Yeoh and Wee, Lionel (2001) 'Reduplication in Colloquial Singapore English'. In Vincent B. Y. Ooi (ed.) ''Evolving Identities: The English Language in Singapore and Malaysia'', Singapore: Times Academic Press, pp. 89-101.&lt;/ref&gt;
* I'm the kind who is '''buddy-buddy''' person.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (2007) ''Singapore English'', Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adjective]]s of one or two syllables can also be repeated for intensification:
* You go take the '''big-big''' one ah. (Retrieve the larger item, please.)
* You want a raise from this boss? Wait '''long long''' ah. (It will never happen.)

Due to the frequent use of these repetitions on short words, Singlish expressions often sound to speakers of American or British English as if they are spoken by children, which non-Singlish speakers find quite amusing, and contributes to the impression of Singlish as an informal and sometimes intimate language.

===Discourse particles===

[[Grammatical particle|Particles]] in Singlish are highly comparable to [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. In general, [[discourse particle]]s, also known as "tags" occur at the end of a sentence. Their presence changes the meaning or the tone of the sentence, but not its grammatical meaning.

Particles are noted for keeping their [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] regardless of the remainder of the sentence. Most of the particles are directly borrowed from southern Chinese varieties, with the tones intact.

Research on Singlish discourse particles have been many but varied, often focusing on analysing their functions in the sentences they appear in.&lt;ref&gt;Wee, Lionel. "Lor in colloquial Singapore English". Journal of Pragmatics, 2002, p. 711&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singlish phrases===
'''''Wah Lau / Walao'''''

''Wah lau'' is derived from a Hokkien or Teochew phrase that means "my father". It is used as an interjection or exclamation at the beginning of a sentence, and it usually has a negative connotation. 
* '''Wah lau'''! I can't believe the teacher gave us so much work to do in such a tight deadline!

====''Kena''====

''Kena'' can be used as an auxiliary to mark the passive voice in some varieties of Singlish.&lt;ref&gt;Wee, Lionel (2004) 'Singapore English: morphology and syntax'.

In Bernd Kortmann, Kate Burridge, Rajend Mesthrie, Edgar W. Schneider and Clive Upton (eds.) A Handbook of Varieties of English. Volume 2: Morphology and Syntax, Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, pp. 1058–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is derived from a Malay word that means "to encounter or to come into physical contact",&lt;ref&gt;Bao Zhiming and Wee, Lionel (1999) 'The passive in Singapore English', ''World Englishes'', 18 (1), 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; and is only used with objects that have a negative effect or connotation. Verbs after ''kena'' may appear in the infinitive form (i.e. without tense) or as a [[past participle]]. It is similar in meaning to passive markers in Chinese, such as Hokkien ''tio'' or Mandarin 被 ''bèi'':
* He was scolded. = He got scolded. = He '''kena''' scold/scolded.
* If you don't listen to me, you will be punished, after which you will know that you were wrong = If you dun listen, later you get punished, and then you know = don't listen, later you '''kena''' punish/punished then you know.

'''Kena''' is not used with positive things:
*&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;He '''kena''' praised.
*&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;He '''kena''' lottery.
*&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;He '''kena''' jackpot. (huge winnings from playing the slot machine)

Use of kena as in the above examples will not be understood, and may even be greeted with a confused reply: ''But strike lottery good wat!'' (But it's a good thing to win the lottery!).

It may be used in vulgar, obscene and offensive contexts,{{Dubious|date=July 2009}} such as:
* He '''kena''' fucked in the Singtel share buyout. (lost large amounts of money)
* He '''kena''' defamation imprisonment. (imprisoned as a result of defamation proceedings)

However, when used in sarcasm, kena can be used in apparently positive circumstances, though this is considered grammatically incorrect by the true natives of Singapore. It is mostly incorrectly used by European expatriates or Hong Kong and Mainlanders trying to integrate and assimilate into Singapore society,{{Dubious|date=July 2009}} though with an ironic modicum of success, for example:
* He '''kena''' jackpot, come back to school after so long den got so much homework! (He received a lot of homework upon returning to school after a long absence.)

When the context is given, ''Kena'' may be used without a verb, similar to the colloquial-English construction "I am/you're/he is going to get it."
* Better do your homework, otherwise you '''kena'''. (You will be punished unless you do your homework.)
* Don't listen to me, later you '''kena'''.

Using another auxiliary verb with ''kena'' is perfectly acceptable as well:
* Better do your homework, otherwise you will '''kena'''.
* Don't listen to me, later you will '''kena'''.

Some examples of Singlish phrases with ''Kena'':
* kena arrow: be assigned an undesirable task. (derives from [[National Service in Singapore|National Service/military]] practice of placing arrows on a mail distribution list to denote addressees for the copy)
* kena bully: get bullied
* kena demolish: literally "was demolished" or "demolition"
* kena fine: get 'fined', or charged by the police
* kena hantam: be hit by something, such as a ball, or to be beaten up (hantam is another Malay word)
* kena sabo: become a victim of sabotage or a practical joke
* Kena fucked: get set up
* kena sai: literally "hit by shit"; be harmed by an unpleasant event or object
* kena tekan: tekan means "press", as in "pressure", in Malay; the phrase means to be physically tortured or punished. Often used in the army, which all male citizens must serve in.
* kena whack: be beaten badly, in games or in physical fights
* kena ban/silence: one of the newer uses of kena, it means to be banned/silenced in a computer game. The "silence" is only used when silenced from talking in chat by GMs (Game Masters), not having the "silence" effect that stops you from doing spells.
* kena zero: getting a zero mark for that paper that he/she was [[cheating]]

The word may be phonetically mispronounced "kana" by most non-Malays, especially by those of the Chinese tongue. Informal Malay may socio-linguistically dictate it be pronounced as ''kene'' (as in ''kernel'' without the ''r'' and ''l''), while the word itself in reality has two different meanings; "to have (to) encounter(ed) something" as how it is explained above or "to have to (do something)":

"Kau '''kena''' angkat ni." – ''You have to carry this.''&lt;br&gt;
"Joe '''kena''' marah tadi." – ''Joe just got scolded.''

Singlish, however, is only influenced by the latter application of the word.

====''Tio''====
''Tio'' can be used interchangeably with ''kena'' in many scenarios. While ''kena'' is often used in negative situations, ''tio'' can be used in both positive and negative situations.
* He tio cancer. (He was diagnosed with cancer.)
* He tio jackpot. (He struck the jackpot.)
* He tio lottery. (He struck lottery.)
* Tio fined lor, what to do? (I got fined, couldn't help it.)

''Tio'' has a lighter negative tone when used negatively, compared to ''kena''.
* Kena fined lor, what to do?
* Tio fined lor, what to do?

Both mean the same, but ''kena'' makes the speaker sound more unhappy with the situation than ''tio''.

''Tio'' also sounds more sympathetic when talking about an unfortunate incident about someone close.
* Her mum tio cancer. (Her mum was diagnosed with cancer.)
* Sad sia, so young tio cancer. (How sad, he was diagnosed with cancer at such a young age.)

Using ''kena'' in the following might not be appropriate, as they seem impolite, as if the speaker is mocking the victim.
* Her mum kena cancer.
* He kena cancer.

====''One''====

The word ''one'' is used to emphasise the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] of the sentence by implying that it is unique and characteristic. It is analogous to the use of particles like 嘅 (ge) or 架 (ga) in Cantonese, 啲 (e) in Hokkien, (-wa) in spoken Japanese, or 的 (de) in some varieties of Mandarin. ''One'' used in this way '''does not''' correspond to any use of the word "one" in [[British English|British]], [[American English]], [[Australian English]], etc.: It can be compared to the British usage of 'eh'. It might also be analysed as a relative pronoun, though it occurs at the end of the relative clause instead of the beginning (as in Standard English)&lt;ref&gt;Alsagoff, Lubna (1995) 'Colloquial Singapore English: the relative clause construction', in Teng Su Ching and Ho Mian Lian (eds.) ''The English Language in Singapore: Implications for Teaching'', Singapore: Singapore Association for Applied Linguistics, pp. 77–87.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wah lau! So stupid '''one'''! – ''Oh my gosh! He's so stupid!''
* I do everything by habit '''one'''. – ''I always do everything by habit.''
* He never go school '''one'''. – ''He doesn't go to school (unlike other people).''

For speakers of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], 的 (de) can also be used in place of ''one''.

====''Then''====

The word '''then''' is often pronounced or written as '''den''' {{IPA|/dɛn/}}. When used, it represents different meanings in different contexts. In this section, the word is referred to as '''den'''.

'''i)''' "Den" can be synonymous with "so" or "therefore". It is used to replace the Chinese grammatical particle, 才 (see ii).

When it is intended to carry the meaning of "therefore", it is often used to explain one's blunder/negative consequences. In such contexts, it is a translation from Chinese "所以". When used in this context, the "den" is prolonged twice the usual length in emphasis, as opposed to the short emphasis it is given when used to mean cai2.
* Never do homework '''den''' (2 beats with shifts in tone sandhi, tone 2) indicating replacement of "所以") kena get scolding lor.
– ''I did not do my homework, that's why (therefore) I got a scolding''
* Never do homework (pause) '''den''' (2 beats with shifts in tone sandhi, tone 2) indicating replacement of "然后") kena scolding lor.
– ''I did not do my homework; I got a scolding after that''
* Never do homework '''den''' (1 beat with no shift in tone sandhi, indicating "才") kena scolding lor.
– ''It is only due to the fact that I did not do my homework that I was scolded.''

Be very careful because "den" cannot be freely interchanged with "so". It will sound grammatically erroneous when employed inappropriately. This is because the grammatical rules in English do not correspond to the grammatical rules in Chinese on a one-for-one basis.

The following examples are inappropriate use of "den", which will immediately sound grammatically illogical to a Singlish speaker: &lt;!-- why? what is the reason for this? In the following sentences, in Singlish, the Singlish particle "so" would be used, or no particle at all, "then" is not used. --&gt;
* I'm tired, '''den''' I'm going to sleep.
* I'm late, '''den''' I'm going to take a taxi.

The reason for this is that "den" often marks a negative, non-volitional outcome (either in the future or the past), while the above sentences express volition and are set in the present. Consider the following examples:
* I damn tired '''den''' langgar the car lor. - ''I was really tired, which is why I knocked into [that] car.''
* I late '''den''' take taxi, otherwise don't take. - ''When I'm late, [only] then do I take a taxi; otherwise I don't take taxis.'' = ''I only take a taxi when I'm late.'' (see usage vi)

'''ii)''' "Den" is also used to describe an action that will be performed later. It is used to replace the Chinese particle, "才". When used in this context, the den is pronounced in one beat, instead of being lengthened to two beats as in (i).

If shortened, the meaning will be changed / incorrectly conveyed. For example, "I go home liao, "den" (2 beats) call you" will imbue the subtext with a questionable sense of irony, a lasciviousness for seduction (3 beats), or just general inappropriateness (random 2 beats indicating a Hong Kong comedy-influenced moleitou 無理頭 Singaporean sense of humour).
* I go home liao '''den''' call you. – ''I will call you when I reach home''
* Later '''den''' say. – ''We'll discuss this later''

'''iii)''' "Den" can used at the beginning of a sentence as a link to the previous sentence. In this usage, "den" is used to replace the Mandarin grammatical particle which is approximately equivalent in meaning (but not in grammatical usage) only to "then," or "然后" (ran2 hou4), as in "ran2hou4 hor". In such cases, it often carries a connotation of an exclamation.

When used in this context, in formal Singlish, the particle is lengthened to 2 beats to indicate replacement of "ran2hou4" or 1 beat when used in conjunction with "hor" as in "den hor".

It can also be shortened to 1 beat if the other speaker is a fluent Singapore speaker of Singlish (who tends to speak fast and can deduce via contextual clues which form of meaning the use of den is taking on), but the Singlish variant used when spoken to a wider Southeast Asian audience, is lengthening of the word to 2 beats.

The subtle usage of these particles differentiates a Malaysian speaking Manglish trying to assimilate into society, and a true-blue native-born Singaporean (whether it's a Chinese, Indian, Eurasian, Malay or Caucasian speaker of Singlish). In many cases, a mixed child born and bred in Singapore will speak a more subtle form of Singlish (together with the influence of another language such as Dutch, Swedish, German) than a first-generation Malaysian of Chinese descent assimilating into Singapore.
* We were doing everything fine, "den" he fuck everything up
* I was at a park. '''Den''' hor, I was attacked by dinosaur leh!
* I woke up at 10. '''Den''' boss saw me coming in late. So suay!

'''iv)''' "Den" can be used to return an insult/negative comment back to the originator. When used in such a way, there must first be an insult/negative comment from another party. In such contexts, it is a translation from Chinese "才".
* A: You're so stupid!
* B: You '''den''' stupid la – ''You're the stupid one''
* A: You're late!
* B: You '''den''' late lor. – ''You're the late one''

'''v)''' "Den?" can be used as a single-worded phrase. Even if "den" is used in a single-worded phrase, even with the same pronunciation, it can represent 4 different meanings. It can either be synonymous with "so what?", or it can be a sarcastic expression that the other party is making a statement that arose from his/her actions, or similarly an arrogant expression which indicating that the other party is stating the obvious, or it can be used as a short form for "what happened then?".

[Synonymous with "so what?"]
* A: I slept at 4 last night leh...
* B: '''Den?'''

[Sarcastic expression] Speakers tend to emphasise the pronunciation of 'n'.
''Context: A is supposed to meet B before meeting a larger group but A is late for the first meeting''
* A: Late liao leh...
* B: '''Dennn?'''

[Arrogant expression] Speakers have the option of using "Den" in a phrase, as in "Ah Bu Den" or "Ah Den". In this case it serves approximately the same purpose as 'duh' in American English slang.
* A: Wah {{Not a typo|seh}}! You actually make this computer all by yourself ah?
* B: Ah bu den!

[Ah, but then? (What happened after that?)]
* A: I found $100 today...
* B: '''Den''' what?

'''vi)''' "Den" can also indicate a conditional (an if-then condition), implying an omitted "if"/"when":
* I late '''den''' take taxi, otherwise dun take. - ''When I'm late, [only] then do I take a taxi; otherwise I don't take taxis.'' = ''I only take a taxi when I'm late.''
* You want to see [[Justin Bieber]] den go lah! - ''If you want to see [[Justin Bieber]], then go [to the concert]!''

====''Oi''====

{{See also|Oi (interjection)}}

'''Oi''' originating from the Hokkien (喂,oe), is commonly used in Singlish, as in other English varieties, to draw attention or to express surprise or indignation. Some examples of the usage of ''Oi'' include:
* Oi, you forgot to give me my pencil!
* Oi! Hear me can!
* Oi! You know how long I wait for you?!
* Oi! Wake up lah!

As "Oi" has connotations of disapproval, it is considered to be slightly offensive if it is used in situations where a more polite register is expected, e.g. while speaking to strangers in public, people in the workplace or one's elders.

====''Lah''====
[[File:Singlish advertisement, Pulau Ubin, Singapore - 20110926.jpg|thumb|''Lah'' (La) being used on an advertising board outside a cafe in [[Pulau Ubin]] ]]
The ubiquitous word '''lah''' ({{IPA|/lá/}} or {{IPA|/lâ/}}), sometimes spelled as '''la''' and rarely spelled as '''larh''', '''luh''' or '''lurh''', is used at the end of a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Wee, Lionel (2004) 'Reduplication and discourse particles', in Lisa Lim (ed.) ''Singapore English: A Grammatical Description'', Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 105-126&lt;/ref&gt; It originates from the Hokkien word ({{lang|zh|啦}}, [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī|POJ]]: ''lah'') used by Chinese people when they speak Singlish, although its usage in Singapore is also been rarely influenced by its occurrence in Malay.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (2007) ''Singapore English'', Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  It simultaneously softens the force of an utterance and entices solidarity,&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Jack C. and Tay, Mary W. J. (1977) 'The la particle in Singapore English', in William Crewe (ed.), ''The English Language in Singapore'', Singapore: Eastern Universities Press, pp. 141–156.&lt;/ref&gt; though it can also have the opposite meaning so it is used to signal power.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Roger and Ser Peng Quee, Larry (1983) '"Today la?" "Tomorrow lah!" The LA particle in Singapore English', ''RELC Journal'', 14(2), 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are suggestions that there is more than one '''lah''' particle, so there may be a stressed and an unstressed variant&lt;ref&gt;Kwan-Terry, Anna (1978) 'The meaning and the source of the "la" and the "what" particles in Singapore English', ''RELC Journal'', 9(2), 22–36.&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps as many as nine tonal variants, all having a special pragmatic function&lt;ref&gt;Loke Kit Ken and Low, Johna M. Y. (1988) 'A proposed descriptive framework for the pragmatic meanings of the particle LA in colloquial Singaporean English', ''Asian-Pacific Papers: Applied Linguistics of Australia Occasional Papers'', 2, 150–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that 'lah' is occasionally after a comma for clarity, though true locals never bother with punctuation, because there is never a pause before 'lah'. This is because in Malay, 'lah' is appended to the end of the word and is not a separate word by itself. It must also be noted that although 'lah' is usually spelled in the Malay fashion, its use is more akin to the Hokkien use. It is not related to 'la',  found in the [[Scouse]] dialect in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], which is short for 'lad'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=noZ5AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22la%22+%22lad%22+Scouse&amp;dq=%22la%22+%22lad%22+Scouse&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiigd3ioZvbAhWMipAKHeuyBxYQ6AEINTAC ''Talking for Britain: A Journey Through the Nation's Dialects''], 
Simon Elmes, Penguin Books, 2005, page 232&lt;/ref&gt;

In Malay, 'lah' is used to change a verb into a command or to soften its tone, particularly when usage of the verb may seem impolite. To drink is ''minum'', but 'Here, drink!' is "minumlah!". Similarly, 'lah' is frequently used with imperatives in Singlish:
* Drink '''lah'''!{{spaced ndash}}Just drink!

'Lah' also occurs frequently with "Yah" and "No" (hence "Yah lah!" and "No lah!..."). This can, with the appropriate tone, result in a less-brusque declaration and facilitate the flow of conversation.  "No more work to do, we go home lah!" However, if the preceding clause is already diminutive or jocular, suffixing it with -lah would be redundant and improper: one would not say "yep lah", "nope lah", or "ta lah" (as in the British "Ta" for "thank you").
* 'Lah' with a low tone might indicate impatience.  "Eh, hurry up lah."

''Lah'' is often used with brusque, short, negative responses:
* I dun have '''lah'''!{{spaced ndash}}I just don't have any of that (which you were requesting)!
* Dun know oreddy '''lah'''!{{spaced ndash}}Argh, I don't know any more than what I told you!'' or ''I give up trying to understand this!

''Lah'' is also used for reassurance:
* Dun worry, he can one '''lah'''.{{spaced ndash}}Don't worry, he will be capable of doing it.
* Okay '''lah'''.{{spaced ndash}}It's all right. Don't worry about it.

''Lah'' is sometimes used to curse people
* Go and Die ''lah''!.

''Lah'' can also be used to emphasise items in a spoken list, appearing after each item in the list.

Although ''lah'' can appear nearly anywhere, it does not appear with a yes-no question. Other particles are used instead:
* He do that '''ah'''?
* Later free '''or not'''?
* Don't tell me he punch her '''ah'''?

====''Wat''====

The particle '''wat''' ({{IPA|/wàt/}}), also spelled '''what''', is used to remind or contradict the listener,&lt;ref name="Wee, Lionel 1072"&gt;Wee, Lionel (2004) 'Singapore English: morphology and syntax'. In Bernd Kortmann, Kate Burridge, Rajend Mesthrie, Edgar W. Schneider and Clive Upton (eds.) ''A Handbook of Varieties of English. Volume 2: Morphology and Syntax'', Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, pp. 1058–1072.&lt;/ref&gt; especially when strengthening another assertion that follows from the current one:
* But he very good at Math '''wat'''.{{spaced ndash}}But he is very good at Mathematics. (Shouldn't you know this already, having known him for years?)
* You never give me '''wat'''!{{spaced ndash}}(It's not my fault, since) You didn't give it to me! (Or else I would have gotten it, right?)
* I never punch him '''wat!'''{{spaced ndash}}(I did not punch him) I did not punch him! (Or else I am the one, right?)

It can also be used to strengthen any assertion:&lt;ref name="Platt 1989"&gt;Platt, John and Ho, Mian Lian (1989) 'Discourse particles in Singaporean English', ''World Englishes'', 8 (2), 215-221.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The food there not bad '''wat'''. Can try lah.

This usage is noticeably characterised by a low tone on '''wat''', and parallels the assertive Mandarin particle 嘛 in expressions like "不错嘛".

====''Mah''====

'''Mah''' ({{IPA|/má/}}), originating from both Hokkien and Cantonese (嘛, ''ma''), is used to assert that something is obvious and final,&lt;ref&gt;Low Ee Ling and Brown, Adam (2005) ''English in Singapore: An Introduction'', Singapore: McGraw-Hill Education (Asia), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; and is usually used only with statements that are already patently true. It is often used to correct or cajole, and in some contexts is similar to English's ''[[wikt:duh|duh]]''. This may seem condescending to the listener:
* This one also can work one '''mah'''! – ''Can't you see that this choice will also work?''
* He also know about it '''mah'''! – ''He knew about it as well, [so it's not my fault!]''

====''Lor''====

'''Lor''' ({{IPA|/lɔ́/}}), also spelled '''lorh''' or '''loh''', from Hokkien (啰, ''lor''), is a casual, sometimes jocular way to assert upon the listener either direct observations or obvious inferences.&lt;ref name="Wee, Lionel 1072"/&gt; It also carries a sense of resignation, or alternatively, dismissiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Low Ee Ling and Brown, Adam (2005) ''English in Singapore: An Introduction'', Singapore: McGraw-Hill Education (Asia), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; that "it happens this way and can't be helped":
* If you don't do the work, then you die liao '''lor'''!{{spaced ndash}}''If you don't do the work, then you're dead!''
* Kay '''lor''', you go and do what you want.{{spaced ndash}}''Fine, go ahead and do what you want.''
* Dun have work to do, den go home '''lor'''.{{spaced ndash}}''If you're done working, you should go home.  (What are you waiting for?)''
* Ya '''lor'''.{{spaced ndash}}''! ''Used when agreeing with someone''

====''Leh''====

'''Leh''' ({{IPA|/lɛ́/ or /lé/}}), from Hokkien (leh 咧), is used to soften a command, request, claim, or complaint that may be brusque otherwise:
* Gimme '''leh'''.{{spaced ndash}}Please, just give it to me.
* How come you don't give me '''leh'''?{{spaced ndash}}Why aren't you giving it to me?
* The ticket seriously ex '''leh'''.{{spaced ndash}}Argh, The tickets are really expensive.
* But I believe safe better than sorry '''leh'''.{{spaced ndash}}The thing is, I believe it's better to be safe than sorry.
* Why you never give up your seat '''leh'''?{{spaced ndash}}

Especially when on a low tone, it can be used to show the speaker's disapproval:&lt;ref name="Platt 1989"/&gt;
* You call her walk there, very far '''leh'''. (If you ask her to go there on foot, it will be a rather long distance.)

====''Hor''====

'''Hor''' ({{IPA|/hɔ̨̌/}}), from Hokkien (乎 honn), also spelled '''horh''', is used to ask for the listener's attention and consent/support/agreement:&lt;ref&gt;Low ee Ling and Brown, Adam (2005) ''English in Singapore: An Introduction'', Singapore: McGraw-Hill Education (Asia), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually pronounced with a low tone.
* Then '''hor''', another person came out of the house.{{spaced ndash}}And then, another person came out of the house.
* This shopping center very nice '''hor'''.{{spaced ndash}}This shopping centre is very nice isn't it?
* Oh yah '''hoh'''! – Oh, yes! (realising something)

====''Ar''====

'''Ar''' ({{IPA|/ǎ/}}), also spelled '''arh''' or '''ah''', is inserted between topic and comment.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David and Low Ee Ling (2003) 'A corpus-based description of particles in spoken Singapore English'. In David Deterding, Low Ee Ling and Adam Brown (eds.) ''English in Singapore: Research on Grammar'', Singapore: McGraw-Hill Education (Asia), pp. 58-66.&lt;/ref&gt; It often gives a negative tone:
* This boy '''ah''', always so rude one!{{spaced ndash}}''This boy is so rude!''

'''Ar''' ({{IPA|/ǎ/}}) with a rising tone is used to reiterate a rhetorical question:
* How come like dat one, '''ah'''?{{spaced ndash}}''Why is it like that? / Why are you like that?''

'''Ar''' ({{IPA|/ā/}}) with a mid-level tone, on the other hand, is used to mark a genuine question that does require a response: ('or not' can also be used in this context.)
* You going again '''ar'''?{{spaced ndash}}"Are you going again?"

====''Hah''====

'''Hah''' ({{IPA|/hǎ/}}), also spelled '''har''', originating from the British English word '''huh''' or Hokkien ('''hannh''' 唅), is used to express disbelief, shock or used in a questioning manner.
* '''Har?''' He really ponned class yesterday ar! – ''What? Is it true that he played truant (=ponteng, shortened to 'pon' and converted into past tense, hence 'ponned') yesterday?''
* '''Har?''' How he tio caning?  – ''What? How did he end up being caned?''

====''Meh''====

'''Meh''' ({{IPA|/mɛ́/}}), from Cantonese (咩, ''meh''), is used to form questions expressing surprise or scepticism:
* They never study '''meh'''?{{spaced ndash}}Didn't they study? (I thought they did.)
* You don't like that one '''meh'''?{{spaced ndash}}You don't like that? (I thought you did.)
* Really '''meh'''?{{spaced ndash}}Is that really so? (I honestly thought otherwise/I don't believe you.)

====''Siol''====

'''Siol''' is not a vulgar word. It is an adaptation of the word "Siul" (which means whistles). Often misunderstood as the word "Sial", '''Siol''' has no meaning at all (least if it's spelt Siul.) '''Siol''' is used to avoid using the word "Sial", which is a vulgarity and not acceptable in speech among most Malay families, and can be compared to the word "[[fuck]]". Sial is considered extremely rude if applied as a "sentence enhancer". To avoid getting '''"back-hand"''' (slapped across the face) by the elders between the families, the word "Siol" was created.

'''Example,'''

Using "Sial" - while having family dinner at home, a seven-year-old child says to his/her mother, 
"Apa "sial" Mak bebual?" - "What the fuck are you talking about, mom?"- risk of getting ''''back-hand'''' from parents is highest.

Using '''Siol''' - same scenario as above,
"Apa '''Siol''' Mak bebual?" - "What the whistle are you talking about, mom?" - risk of punishment from parents is lowest.

====''Siah''====

{{IPA|/sjà/}}, also spelled '''sia''' or '''siah''', is used to express envy or emphasis. It is a derivative of the Malay vulgar word "sial" (derivative of the parent, used interchangeably but sometimes may imply a stronger emphasis). Originally, it is often used by Malay peers in informal speech between them, sometimes while enraged, and other times having different implications depending on the subject matter:

"Kau ade problem ke ape, ''sial''?" – ''Do you have a problem or what?'' (negative, enraged)&lt;br&gt;
"''Sial'' ah, Joe bawak iPad ni ari." – ''Whoa, Joe brought an iPad today.'' (positive, envy)&lt;br&gt;
"Takde lah ''sial''." – ''No way, man.'' or ''I don't have it, man.'' (positive, neutral)&lt;br&gt;
"Joe kene marah ''sial''." – ''Joe got scolded, man.'' (positive, emphasis)

Malays may also pronounce it without the ''l'', not following the ''ia'' but rather a nasal ''aah''. This particular form of usage is often seen in expressing emphasis. There is a further third application of it, in that a ''k'' is added at the end when it will then be pronounced ''saak'' with the same nasal quality only when ending the word. It is similarly used in emphasis.

However, Singlish itself takes influence only from the general expression of the term without any negative implication, and non-Malay speakers (or Malays speaking to non-Malays) pronounce it either as a nasal ''sia'' or simply ''siah'':
* He damn zai '''sia'''.{{spaced ndash}}''He's damn capable.''
* Wah, heng '''sia'''.{{spaced ndash}}''Goodness me (=Wahlau)! That was a close shave (=heng)!''

====''Sha Pi''====

'''Sha Pi''', from Mandarin, is used as a colloquial term to describe someone as behaving in a weird and idiotic manner, or someone who is full of nonsense. The term "sha" is derived from the Mandarin equivalent of "idiot" and "pi" is derived from the Mandarin equivalent of "fart". The term "sha pi" originated from Shanghai, and was thought to be used extensively by Singaporeans, especially young adults.
* "Don't '''sha pi'''!{{spaced ndash}}Don't act like an idiot'' or ''Don't say such nonsense

====' 'Wa Lao Eh' '====
'''Wa Lao''' is a commonly used word by many Singlish speakers in Singapore. More and more children know how to use this term, which is a bit like a swear word. It stems from the Chinese 我老, which means "my old (father)".
--&gt;

====''Sai''====

/sâi/
Also from Hokkien, it literally means excrement. This is also used in "''kena sai''", which means to be humiliated (see earlier part of this section for the definition of "''kena''").

====''Siao''====

/siâo/
derived from Hokkien
'''''Siao''''' is a common word in Singlish. Literally, it means crazy.
* You ''siao'' ah? – * Are you crazy? (With sarcasm)

===Miscellaneous===

'''Nia''' is originated from Hokkien which means 'only', mostly used to play down something that has been overestimated.
* Anna: ''"I not so old lah, I 18 '''nia'''."''

'''"Then you know"''' is a phrase often used at the end of a sentence or after a warning of the possible negative consequences of an action. Can be directly translated as "and you will regret not heeding my advice". Also a direct translation of the Chinese '你才知道'.
* Mother: ''"Ah boy, don't run here run there, wait you fall down '''then you know''' ah."''

'''Aiyyo''' (also spelled '''aiyo'''): A state of surprise. Originally from Chinese "哎哟".

"There is"/"there are" and "has"/"have" are both expressed using '''got''', so that sentences can be translated in either way back into British / American / Australasian English. This is equivalent to the Chinese 有 ''yǒu'' (to have):
* '''Got''' question? ''Any questions?'' / ''Is there a question?'' / ''Do you have a question?''
* Yesterday ar, Marina Bay Sands '''got''' so many people one! ''There were so many people at Marina Bay Sands yesterday.'' / ''Marina Bay Sands had so many people [there] yesterday.''
* This bus '''got''' air-con or not? ''Is there air-conditioning on this bus?'' / ''Does this bus have air-conditioning?''
* Where '''got'''!? ''Where is there [this]?'', or less politely, ''There isn't/aren't any!'' also more loosely, ''What are you talking about?''; generic response to any accusation. Translation of the Malay "mana ada?" which has the same usage.

'''Can''' is used extensively as both a question particle and an answer particle. The negative is ''cannot''.
* Gimme '''can'''? ''Can you please give that to me?''
* Can! ''Sure!''
* Cannot. ''No way.''

''Can'' can be repeated for greater emphasis or to express enthusiasm:
* Boss: ''"Can you send me the report by this afternoon?"'' Employee: ''"Can, Can!"'' (No problem!)

The Malay word with the same meaning '''boleh''' can be used in place of ''can'' to add a greater sense of multiculturalism in the conversation. The person in a dominant position may prefer to use ''boleh'' instead:
* Employee: ''"Boss, tomorrow can get my pay check or not?"'' Boss: ''"Boleh lah ..."'' (sure/possibly)

The phrase '''like that''' is commonly appended to the end of the sentence to emphasise descriptions by adding vividness and continuousness. Due to its frequency of use, it is often pronounced '''lidat''' (lye-dat):
* He so stupid '''like that'''. – ''He really seems pretty stupid, you know.''
* He acting like a one-year-old baby '''like that'''. – ''He's really acting like a one-year-old baby, you know.''
''Like that'' can also be used as in other Englishes:
* Why he acting '''like that'''? – ''Why is he acting this way?''
* If '''like that''', how am I going to answer to the ''gong shi ting''? – ''If that's the case, how am I going to answer to the board of directors?''

In British English, "also" is used before the predicate, while "too" is used after the predicative at the end of the sentence. In Singlish (also in American and Australian English), "also" (pronounced '''oso''', see phonology section above) can be used in either position.
* I '''oso''' like dis one. (I also like this one.)
* I like dis one '''also'''. (I like this one too.)

"Also" is also used as a [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]]. In this case, "A also B" corresponds to "B although A". This stems from Chinese, where the words 也 (yě), 还 (hái) or 都 (dōu) (meaning also, though usage depends on dialect or context) would be used to express these sentences.
* I try so hard '''oso''' cannot do. (I tried so hard, and still I can't do it. OR I can't do it even though I tried so hard.)

The order of the verb and the subject in an indirect question is the same as a direct question.
* "Eh, you know '''where is''' he or not?" ''"Excuse me, do you know '''where''' he '''is'''?"''

"Ownself" is often used in place of "yourself", or more accurately, "yourself" being an individual, in a state of being alone.
* "Har? He '''ownself''' go party yesterday for what?" ''"Why did he go to the party alone yesterday?"''

Not all expressions with the ''-self'' pronouns should be taken literally, but as the omission of "by":
* Wah, hungry liao! You eat yourself, we eat ourself, can? (Hey, I/you should be hungry by this time! Let's split up and eat. (Then meet up again)

Some people have begun to add extra "ed"s to the past tense of words or to pronounce "ed" separately, sometimes in a form of exaggeration of the past tense. Most of the time, the user uses it intentionally to mock proper English.
* "Just now go and play game, character '''dieded''' siah!" ''"When I played a game just now, my character died!"''

==Vocabulary==

{{Main|Singlish vocabulary}}

Singlish formally takes after [[British English]] (in terms of [[spelling]] and [[abbreviation]]s), although naming conventions are in a mix of American and British ones (with American ones on the rise). For instance, local media have "sports pages" (sport in British English) and "soccer coverage" (the use of the word "soccer" is not common in British media), though the word "football" is also taken to be synonymous with "soccer" in Singapore.

Singlish also uses many words borrowed from [[Min Nan|Hokkien]], and from [[Malay language|Malay]]. The most well-known instance of a borrowing from Hokkien is 'kiasu', which means "frightened of losing out&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidesify.com/blog/2017/08/13/singlish-phrases-define-singapore/|title=Singlish Guide: 125 Phrases/Words That Define SG (Singaporean English)|website=www.guidesify.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;", and is used to indicate behaviour such as queueing overnight to obtain something; and the most common borrowing from Malay is 'makan', meaning "to eat".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Adam (1999) ''Singapore English in a Nutshell''. Singapore: Federal, pp. 123 &amp; 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, English words take on the meaning of their Chinese counterparts, resulting in a shift in meaning. This is most obvious in such cases as "borrow"/"lend", which are functionally equivalent in Singlish and mapped to the same Hokkien word, "借" (chio), which can mean to lend or to borrow. ("Oi (also used as oy, although Singaporeans spell it as oi), can borrow me your calculator?"); and 'send' can be used to mean "accompany someone", as in "Let me send you to the airport", possibly under the influence of the Hokkien word "送" (sang).&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (2000) 'Potential influences of Chinese on the written English of Singapore'. In Adam Brown (Ed.) ''English in Southeast Asia 99: Proceedings of the Fourth 'English in Southeast Asia' Conference'', Singapore, National Institute of Education, pp. 201-209. [http://videoweb.nie.edu.sg/phonetic/papers/chin-infl-on-eng.html (on-line version)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Malay '(meng)hantar' can also be used to mean both "send a letter" and "take children to school",&lt;ref&gt;Collins (2002) ''Easy Learning Bilingual Dictionary, English~Malay, Malay~English'', Subang Jayar, Malaysia: HarperCollins, p. 716&lt;/ref&gt; so perhaps both Malay and Chinese have combined to influence the usage of 'send' in Singapore.

'''South Franconian''' ({{lang-de|Südfränkisch}}) is a [[High Franconian German|High Franconian]] dialect which is spoken in the northernmost part of [[Baden-Württemberg]] in [[Germany]], around [[Karlsruhe]], [[Mosbach]] and [[Heilbronn]]. Like closely related [[East Franconian German|East Franconian]] it is a transitional dialect, which unites elements of [[Central German]] and [[Upper German]].

The language area is located in the transient zone between [[Rhine Franconian dialects]] ([[Hessian dialects|Hessian]] and [[Palatine German language|Palatinate German]]) in the north and [[Alemannic German]] ([[Low Alemannic German|Low Alemannic]] and [[Swabian German]]) in the south. South Franconian is one of the [[High German languages|High German]] dialects with the lowest number of speakers. South Franconian is not considered a separate dialect by some observers. The scope of South Franconian is disputed.

Besides object types, the terminology model allows defining hierarchical classifications, definitions for object type and [[property]] behavior and definition of casual relations.

The terminology model is a means for subject matter experts to express their knowledge about the subject in subject specific terms. Since the terminology model is structured rather similar to an [[object-oriented]] database schema, is can be transformed without loss of information into an object-oriented [[database schema]]. Thus, the terminology model is a method for problem analysis on the one side and a mean of defining database schema on the other side.

Several terminology models have been developed and published in the field of statistics:

* Terminology model for classifications&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.unece.org/stat/platform/download/attachments/14319930/Part+I+Neuchatel_version+2_1.pdf?version=1 Neuchâtel Terminology Model PART I:

'''Volbrecht Nagel''' (1867&amp;ndash;1921) was a [[Germany|German]] missionary to the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. Initially associated with the [[Evangelical Lutheran]] Church, he later joined the [[Open Brethren]], and is remembered now as a pioneer of the [[Kerala Brethren]] movement.

==Life==
Volbrecht Nagel was born on 3 November 1867 in [[Florstadt]]-Stammheim (belonging to the German federal state of [[Hesse]]). He grew up in a religious family, but lost his parents at a young age. At the age of 18, Nagel claimed to have been [[Born again (Christianity)|born again]] after hearing the gospel from a cobbler turned itinerant [[preacher]]. With a desire to be a missionary, he moved to [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], joined the [[Basel Mission]] Training Institute in 1886 and graduated in 1892. He was [[ordination|ordained]] in the [[Evangelical Lutheran]] Mission in 1893.

Nagel came to [[Kannur|Cannanore]] on the [[Malabar Coast]] as a Reverend in December 1893. He became the head of the Basel Mission center in Vaniankulam. The burden of running the schools and the small-scale industries of the Basel Mission in Vaniankulam became a stumbling block in his goal of independent ministry. In 1896, he left the Lutheran Church and Vaniankulam and went south without an aim. On his trip, he saw a prayer center in [[Kunnamkulam]] and met Paramel Itoop, a new believer. He decided to start his work at Kunnamkulam, an ancient bastion of Christianity in India.

To be part of the local community, he learned [[Malayalam]]. The community in Kunnamkulam received him as one of their own, as he wrote and spoke in Malayalam. In April 1897, he married Harriet Mitchell, an [[Anglo-Indian]] who was a teacher at Kunnamkulam. They had five sons and two daughters. One son and one daughter died in early childhood. Harriet Nagel died on 27 January 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.holypal.com/profiles/blogs/v-nagel-missionary-to-gods-own |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712214214/http://www.holypal.com/profiles/blogs/v-nagel-missionary-to-gods-own |archive-date=2011-07-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months after their marriage, they went to the [[Nilgiris]] and met the English [[Open Brethren]] Missionary [[Handley Bird]]. The following June, Nagel was baptized by immersion by Bird at [[Coimbatore]]. In 1906, he started an orphanage and a home for widows at Nellikunnu near [[Thrissur]] City named Rehoboth, which still stands today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://revisitingthepast.wordpress.com/2010/07/24/the-story-of-vollbrecht-nagel/|title = The Story of Vollbrecht Nagel|date = July 24, 2010|accessdate = December 4, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, Nagel traveled back to his native Germany. His plan was to send his older children to [[England]] for education and return to India in six months, but the beginning of [[World War I]] prevented his return. As a national of the [[German Empire]], he could not enter British-administered Malabar, so he moved to [[Switzerland]]. Harriet and three children were back in Malabar Coast, while the two older children were in England. The letter he sent to the assembly fellowship in [[North Paravur|Paravur]] in 1917 reflects the hunger in his heart for souls in Malabar. That letter contained the following words: ''“My sweetest treasures are in India. My heart belongs there".'' But his desire was not fulfilled. He suffered from [[palsy]] and became bedridden. While teaching at [[Bergneustadt|Wiedenest]] Bible School, Nagel had a stroke and died on 12 May 1921 and was buried there. Harriet had been able to reach Germany and take care of him.

==Writings==
In 1898, Nagel wrote a book called ''Christian Baptism''. He wrote many songs and hymns in [[Malayalam]] that are sung even today by all Christian denominations. Nagel is regarded with great esteem by the [[Malayalee]] Christian community for all his work in bringing the [[Gospel]] to [[Kerala]].

===Malayalam hymns===
Nagel's mother tongue was [[German language|German]]. He became fluent in Malayalam and composed hymns in that language, which are still used in church services.

A few of the hymns in Malayalam and their translations in [[English language|English]] are given below:
* ''Snehathin Idayanam Yesuway; Wazhium sathyaum {{Not a typo|nee}} mathremay'' (Jesus, the loving shepherd, you are the only way and the truth)
* ''Ninnodu Praarthyppan Priya Pithaway'' (Our dear father, we are coming for prayer) – Prayer song
* ''Jayam jayam Kollum Naam, Jayam Kollum Naam'' (Victorious, victorious, we will be victorious) – Victory song
* ''Deivathinte æka putren paapikale rakshippan'' (God's only son died on the cross to save the sinners) – Christ's passion and death
* ''Maranam jayicha veera'' (Hero that won over death) – Resurrection
* ''Yesu varum vegathil – Aswaasamay'' (Jesus will be coming soon) – Second Coming
* ''Ente Jeevanam Yesuway'' (Jesus, my life) – Comfort
* ''Samayamam rathathil njaan swerga yathra cheyyunnu'' (In the chariot of time I am on my homeward journey) – Death

His translations include:
* ''Papakadam theerkuvan'' (What can wash away my sins, by [[Robert Lowry (hymn writer)|Robert Lowry]])
* ''Yeshu enn swanatham, Hallelujah'' ([[Blessed Assurance]], by [[Fanny Crosby]])
* ''Yeshuvin thirupadathil irunnu kelka naam'' (Sing them over again to me, by [[Philip Bliss]])
* ''Kristhuvinte daanam ethra maduram'' (Like a river glorious, by [[Frances Ridley Havergal]])
* ''Yeshuvil en thozhane kande'' (I have found a friend in Jesus, by [[Charles William Fry]]

'''Waimoa''' or '''Waima'a''' is a spoken by about 18,467 (2010 census)&lt;ref name="Census2010-2"/&gt; people in northeast [[East Timor]]. Waimoa proper is reported to be [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with neighboring [[Kairui]] and [[Midiki]], with 5,000 speakers total.

The classification of Waimoa is unclear. Structurally, it is [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]]. However, its vocabulary is largely Papuan, similar to that of [[Makasae language|Makasae]].  Although generally classified as Austronesian languages or dialects that have been largely [[mixed language|relexified]] under the influence of a language related to Makasae, it is possible that Waimoa, Kairui, and Midiki are instead Papuan languages related to Makasae which have been influenced by Austronesian.

== Phonology ==

Waimoa has [[aspirated consonant]]s, and is one of only two (possibly) [[Austronesian languages]] reported to have a set of [[ejective consonant|ejective]] stops, the other being [[Yapese language|Yapese]]:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! !! [[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]] !! [[Coronal consonant|Coronal]] !! [[Velar consonant|Velar]] !! [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]

| {{IPA|pʼ}} || {{IPA|tʼ}} || {{IPA|kʼ}} ||
|-

| {{IPA|b}} || {{IPA|d}} || {{IPA|ɡ}} ||
|}
However, these sounds have also been described as post-glottalized.

There is also [[vowel harmony]].
