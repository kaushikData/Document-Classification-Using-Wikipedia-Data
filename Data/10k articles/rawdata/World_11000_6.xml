The '''African Virtual University''' ('''AVU''') is an pan-African effort to create an open and affordable distance learning institution to serve the African continent. The AVU began in 1997 as a project of the [[World Bank]] and later developed into an autonomous institution after it was handed over to African governments in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.worldbank.org/2OZB6U1230]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=elearning-africa&gt;{{cite web|title=African Virtual University - eLearning Africa|url=http://www.elearning-africa.com/eLA_Newsportal/|publisher=elearning-africa.com|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=web.worldbank&gt;{{cite web|title=African Virtual University|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/0,,contentMDK:20267251~menuPK:538760~pagePK:146736~piPK:226340~theSitePK:258644,00.html|publisher=web.worldbank.org|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=universityworldnews&gt;{{cite web|last=Kyama|first=Reuben|title=African Virtual University makes an actual impact|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20121012184914825|publisher=universityworldnews.com|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=afdb&gt;{{cite web|title=AfDB and African Virtual University discuss benefits of e-learning|url=http://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/article/afdb-and-african-virtual-university-discuss-benefits-of-e-learning-12602/|publisher=afdb.org|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifteen African Governments have signed a Charter establishing the AVU as an [[intergovernmental organization]]. These include Ghana, Mozambique, Kenya, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Benin, Tanzania, Republic Of Guinea, Sudan, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and Mauritania. The AVU has its headquarters in [[Nairobi]], Kenya and a regional office in [[Dakar]], Senegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avu.org/Member-States/member-states.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120200121/http://www.avu.org/Member-States/member-states.html |archivedate=2013-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1524">Several types of '''Ainu fiddle''' have been described by anthropologists of the [[Ainu people]] of Northern Japan and the adjoining [[Russian Far East]] islands of [[Sakhalin]] and [[Kuril]].

The missionary-anthropologist [[John Batchelor (missionary)|John Batchelor]] noted of the Sakhalin Ainu (1901):

{{quote|''The Ainu of Saghlien make a sort of fiddle, some with two, some with three, and others with four or even more strings, according to caprice. There are several of these to be seen in the Sapporo Museum, and others are found among some of those Ishkari Ainu who originally came down from Saghalien when that island was ceded to Russia.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Batchelor|first=John|title=The Ainu and Their Folk-lore|year=1901|publisher=Religious Tract Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x3AAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA273#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

And further of those of [[Karafuto]] (1892):

{{quote|''The Karafuto Ainu are said to have a kind of fiddle with two strings, and another with three, but I have never seen these''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Batchelor|first=John|title=The Ainu of Japan: The Religion, Superstitions, and General History of the Hairy Aborigines of Japan|year=1892|publisher=Religious Tract Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zadFAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Brési.JPG|thumb|Brési]]
'''Brési''' or '''Braisi''' is [[beef]] which has been salted, dried and [[smoking (cooking)|smoked]], which is made in the [[canton of Jura]] and in Jura bernois in [[Switzerland]] and in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Doubs]] in [[France]]. It resembles [[Grisons]] [[Bindenfleisch|Buendnerfleisch]]. Brési is most commonly served thinly sliced at the start of main meals, or else as a side dish with [[fondue]]s.

Brési first appears in works on [[gastronomy]] from about XV.  Its name derives from its rich red colour reminiscent of [[brazilwood]], the (at that time highly prized) Asian timber, which at about the same time gave its name also to [[Brazil]].

The '''Cook Islands''' ([[Cook Islands Māori]]: ''Kūki 'Āirani'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C ''Cook Islands Maori dictionary''] by Jasper Buse &amp; Raututi Taringa, Cook Islands Ministry of Education (1995) page 200&lt;/ref&gt; is a self-governing [[island country]] in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific Ocean]] in [[Associated state|free association]] with [[New Zealand]]. It comprises 15 islands whose total land area is {{convert|240|km2|sqmi|1}}. The Cook Islands' [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ) covers {{convert|1800000|km2|sqmi}} of ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070214035426/http://www.sopac.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Cook+Islands A View from the Cook Islands]. SOPAC&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand is responsible for the Cook Islands' defence and foreign affairs, but they are exercised in consultation with the Cook Islands. In recent times, the Cook Islands have adopted an increasingly independent foreign policy. Although [[Cook Islanders]] are [[New Zealand nationality law|citizens of New Zealand]], they have the status of Cook Islands nationals, which is not given to other New Zealand citizens.

The Cook Islands' main population centres are on the island of [[Rarotonga]] (10,572 in 2011),&lt;ref name=2011census&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cookislands.org.uk/2011census|title=Cook Islands 2011 census|website=Cookislands.org|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where there is an international airport. There is a larger population of Cook Islanders in New Zealand itself; in the 2013 census, 61,839 people said they were Cook Islanders, or of Cook Islands descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/ethnic-profiles.aspx?request_value=24709&amp;parent_id=24706&amp;tabname=#24709|title=2013 Census ethnic group profiles|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Statistics NZ|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With about 100,000 visitors travelling to the islands in the 2010–11&amp;nbsp;financial year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfem.gov.ck/docs/Treasury/Budget/2010-11/BPS%20n%20HYEFU/Combined%20HYEFU%202010-11.pdf|title=The Cook Islands Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update For the Financial Year 2010/2011|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Finance &amp; Economic Management|page=7|date=December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720202328/http://www.mfem.gov.ck/docs/Treasury/Budget/2010-11/BPS%20n%20HYEFU/Combined%20HYEFU%202010-11.pdf|archivedate=20 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; tourism is the country's main industry, and the leading element of the economy, ahead of [[offshore banking]], pearls, and marine and fruit exports.

==Geography==

{{Main|Geography of the Cook Islands}}The Cook Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean, northeast of New Zealand, between [[French Polynesia]] and [[American Samoa]]. There are 15&amp;nbsp;major islands spread over {{convert|2200000|km²|0|abbr=on}} of ocean, divided into two distinct groups: the Southern Cook Islands and the Northern Cook Islands of [[Atoll|coral atolls]].&lt;ref&gt;"Cook Islands Travel Guide" (with description), ''World Travel Guide'', Nexus Media Communications, 2006. Webpage: [http://www.worldtravelguide.net/country/65/country_guide/Australia-and-South-Pacific/Cook-Islands.html WTGuide-Cook-Islands] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026060558/http://www.worldtravelguide.net/country/65/country_guide/Australia-and-South-Pacific/Cook-Islands.html |date=26 October 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands were formed by [[volcanic]] activity; the northern group is older and consists of six atolls, which are sunken volcanoes topped by coral growth. The climate is [[Oceanic climate|moderate]] to [[Tropical climate|tropical]].

The Cook Islands consist of 15 islands and two reefs.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Cook Islands}}

[[File:rarotonga beach.jpg|thumb|left|Beach on [[Rarotonga]]]]
The Cook Islands were first settled in the 6th century by [[Polynesian people]] who migrated from [[Tahiti]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120319005759/http://www.samoa2007.ws/index.php?id=224 Cook Islands] (archived from [http://www.samoa2007.ws/index.php?id=224 the original] on 19 March 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; an island {{convert|1154|km}} to the northeast.

Spanish ships visited the islands in the 16th&amp;nbsp;century; the first written record of contact with the islands came in 1595 with the sighting of [[Pukapuka]] by Spanish sailor [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira]], who called it ''San Bernardo'' (Saint Bernard). [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]], a Portuguese captain working for the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish crown]], made the first recorded European landing in the islands when he set foot on [[Rakahanga]] in 1606, calling it ''Gente Hermosa'' (Beautiful People).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Brian |last=Hooker |date=1998 |journal=[[Terrae Incognitae (journal)|Terrae Incognitae]] |volume=30 |issue=1 |title=European discovery of the Cook Islands |pages=54–62|doi=10.1179/tin.1998.30.1.54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

British navigator Captain [[James Cook]] arrived in 1773 and 1777&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Nicholas (2003). ''Cook : the extraordinary voyages of Captain James Cook'', Walker &amp; Company, {{ISBN|0802714129}}, pp. 310–311.&lt;/ref&gt; and named the island of [[Manuae (Cook Islands)|Manuae]] ''Hervey Island''. Later, the name ''Hervey Islands'' came to be applied to the entire southern group; the name "Cook Islands", in honour of Cook, first appeared on a Russian naval chart published in the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cook-islands.gov.ck/history.php |title=Cook Islands Government website |publisher=Cook-islands.gov.ck |accessdate=18 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326003510/http://www.cook-islands.gov.ck/history.php |archivedate=26 March 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1813 [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]], a missionary on the ''Endeavour'' (not the same ship as Cook's) made the first recorded sighting of [[Rarotonga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chr.org.au/fpbooks/tendecades/TEN%20DECADES%20Chapter%203.doc|title=Ten Decades: The Australasian Centenary History of the London Missionary Society, Rev.

Christianity quickly took hold in the culture and many islanders continue to be Christian believers today.

[[File:Cook Islands Annexation Ceremony.jpg|thumb|Governor [[Lord Ranfurly]] reading the annexation proclamation to [[Makea Takau Ariki|Queen Makea]] on 7 October 1900.]]
The Cook Islands became a British [[protectorate]] in 1888, due largely to community fears that France might occupy the territory as it had Tahiti. On 6{{nbsp}}September 1900, the leading islanders presented a petition asking that the islands (including [[Niue]] "if possible") should be annexed as British territory.&lt;ref name="Kenneth Roberts-Wray 1966. P. 891"&gt;''"Commonwealth and Colonial Law"'' by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966. P. 891&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.Z. Parliamentary Pp., A3 (1901)&lt;/ref&gt; On 8–9 October 1900 seven instruments of cession of Rarotonga and other islands were signed by their chiefs and people; and by a British Proclamation issued at the same time the cessions were accepted, the islands being declared parts of Her Britannic Majesty's dominions.&lt;ref name="Kenneth Roberts-Wray 1966. P. 891"/&gt; These instruments did not include [[Aitutaki]]. It appears that, though the inhabitants regarded themselves as British subjects, the Crown's title was uncertain, and the island was formally annexed by Proclamation dated 9{{nbsp}}October 1900.&lt;ref&gt;"Commonwealth and Colonial Law" by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966. P. 761&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.Z. Parliamentary Pp., A1 (1900)&lt;/ref&gt; The islands were included within the boundaries of the [[Colony of New Zealand]] in 1901 by Order in Council&lt;ref&gt;S.R.O. &amp; S.I. Rev. XVI, 862–863&lt;/ref&gt; under the Colonial Boundaries Act, 1895 of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Kenneth Roberts-Wray 1966. P. 891"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;58 &amp; 59 V. c. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary change became effective on 11{{nbsp}}June 1901 and the Cook Islands have had a formal relationship with New Zealand ever since.&lt;ref name="Kenneth Roberts-Wray 1966. P. 891"/&gt;

When the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948 came into effect on 1{{nbsp}}January 1949, Cook Islanders who were [[British subject]]s gained [[New Zealand citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/citizenship/3 3. Aliens and citizens – Citizenship – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand]. Teara.govt.nz (4 March 2009). Retrieved 26 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The country remained a New Zealand dependent territory until&amp;nbsp;1965, when the New Zealand Government decided to offer self-governing status to its colony. In that year, [[Albert Henry (politician)|Albert Henry]] of the [[Cook Islands Party]] was elected as the first Premier. Henry led the country until he was accused of vote-rigging. He was succeeded in 1978 by [[Tom Davis (Cook Islands)|Tom Davis]] of the [[Democratic Party (Cook Islands)|Democratic Party]].

The Cook Islands is a [[representative democracy]] with a [[parliamentary system]] in an [[associated state]] relationship with New Zealand. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government, with the Chief Minister as [[head of government]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Parliament of the Cook Islands]]. There is a pluriform multi-party system. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. The [[head of state]] is the [[Monarchy in New Zealand|Queen of New Zealand]], who is represented in the Cook Islands by the [[Monarchy in the Cook Islands|Queen's Representative]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The islands are self-governing in "free association" with [[New Zealand]]. New Zealand retains primary responsibility for external affairs, with consultation with the Cook Islands government. Cook Islands nationals are citizens of New Zealand and can receive New Zealand government services, but the reverse is not true; New Zealand citizens are not Cook Islands nationals. Despite this, {{As of|2014|lc=y}}, the Cook Islands had diplomatic relations in its own name with 43 other countries. The Cook Islands is not a United Nations member state, but, along with [[Niue]], has had their "full treaty-making capacity" recognised by [[United Nations Secretariat]],&lt;ref name=art102&gt;{{citation|format=PDF |url=http://legal.un.org/repertory/art102/english/rep_supp8_vol6-art102_e_advance.pdf |title=Repertory of Practice |website=Legal.un.org |number=8 |page=10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019223055/http://legal.un.org/repertory/art102/english/rep_supp8_vol6-art102_e_advance.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=map&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/world00.pdf |website=Legal.un.org |title=The World today |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a full member of the [[WHO]] and [[UNESCO]] [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|UN specialised agencies]], is an associate member of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ([[UNESCAP]]) and a Member of the Assembly of States of the [[International Criminal Court]].

On 11 June 1980, the [[United States]] signed [[Cook Islands – United States Maritime Boundary Treaty|a treaty]] with the Cook Islands specifying the [[maritime boundary|maritime border]] between the Cook Islands and [[American Samoa]] and also relinquishing any American claims to [[Penrhyn Island|Penrhyn]], [[Pukapuka]], [[Manihiki]], and [[Rakahanga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/pits/en/treaty_database/1980/6.html|title=Treaty Between the United States of America and the Cook Islands on Friendship and Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary Between the United States of America and the Cook Islands (and Exchange of Notes)|work=Pacific Islands Treaty Series|publisher=University of the South Pacific School of Law|accessdate=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the Cook Islands and France signed [[Maritime Delimitation Agreement (Cook Islands – France)|a treaty]] that [[boundary delimitation|delimited]] the boundary between the Cook Islands and [[French Polynesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/pits/en/treaty_database/1990/4.html|title=Agreement on Maritime Delimitation Between the Government of the Cook Islands and the Government of the French Republic|work=Pacific Islands Treaty Series|publisher=University of the South Pacific School of Law|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As competition between the US and China heated up in the [[South China Sea]] and other areas closer to the mainland, the Cook Islands began to feel the results. In late August 2012, for instance, [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] visited the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/trvl/2012/196973.htm|title=Secretary Clinton:Travel to the Cook Islands, Indonesia, China, Timor-Leste, Brunai, and Russia|accessdate=4 September 2012|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-south-pacific-20120829,0,4251912.story|title=Hillary Clinton's visit underscores new value of Cook Islands|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|last=Richter|first=Paul|date=29 August 2012|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative subdivisions==
There are island councils on all of the inhabited outer islands (Outer Islands Local Government Act 1987 with amendments up to&amp;nbsp;2004, and Palmerston Island Local Government Act 1993) except [[Nassau (Cook Islands)|Nassau]], which is governed by [[Pukapuka]] ([[Suwarrow]], with only one caretaker living on the island, also governed by Pukapuka, is not counted with the inhabited islands in this context). Each council is headed by a mayor.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the Cook Islands}}
The economy is strongly affected by geography. It is isolated from foreign markets, and has some inadequate infrastructure; it lacks major natural resources, has limited manufacturing and suffers moderately from natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;''Polynesia French Business Law Handbook: Strategic Information and Laws'' {{ISBN|1-4387-7081-2}} p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism provides the economic base that makes up approximately 67.5% of GDP. Additionally, the economy is supported by foreign aid, largely from New Zealand. [[China]] has also contributed foreign aid, which has resulted in, among other projects, the Police Headquarters building. The Cook Islands is expanding its agriculture, mining and fishing sectors, with varying success.

Since approximately 1989, the Cook Islands have become a location specialising in so-called [[asset-protection trusts#Cook Islands|asset protection trusts]], by which investors shelter assets from the reach of creditors and legal authorities.&lt;ref name=flyspeck/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of Offshore Jurisdictions: Cook Islands|url=http://protectyou.com/1996/01/review-of-offshore-jurisdictions-part-1/|publisher=The Asset Protection News|last1=Rosen |first1=Howard |last2=Donlevy-Rosen |first2=Patricia}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', the Cooks have "laws devised to protect foreigners' assets from legal claims in their home countries", which were apparently crafted specifically to thwart the long arm of American justice; creditors must travel to the Cook Islands and argue their cases under Cooks law, often at prohibitive expense.&lt;ref name=flyspeck/&gt; Unlike other foreign jurisdictions such as the [[British Virgin Islands]], the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Switzerland]], the Cooks "generally disregard foreign court orders" and do not require that bank accounts, real estate, or other assets protected from scrutiny (it is illegal to disclose names or any information about Cooks trusts) be physically located within the archipelago.&lt;ref name=flyspeck/&gt; Taxes on trusts and trust employees account for some 8% of the Cook Islands economy, behind tourism but ahead of fishing.&lt;ref name=flyspeck/&gt;

In recent years, the Cook Islands has gained a reputation as a debtor paradise, through the enactment of legislation that permits debtors to shield their property from the claims of creditors.&lt;ref name=flyspeck&gt;{{cite news |last=Wayne |first=Leslie |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/business/international/paradise-of-untouchable-assets.html |title=Cook Islands, a Paradise of Untouchable Assets |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 December 2013 |accessdate= 27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

===Language===
The languages of the Cook Islands include [[English language|English]], [[Cook Islands Māori]], or "[[Rarotongan]]," and [[Pukapukan language|Pukapukan]]. Dialects of Cook Islands Maori include [[Penrhyn language|Penrhyn]]; [[Rakahanga-Manihiki language|Rakahanga-Manihiki]]; the [[Nga-Pu-Toru|Ngaputoru]] dialect of [[Atiu]], [[Mitiaro]], and [[Mauke]]; the [[Aitutaki]] dialect; and the [[Mangaia]]n dialect. Cook Islands Maori and its dialectic variants are closely related to both [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] and to New Zealand [[Māori language|Māori]]. [[Pukapukan]] is considered closely related to the [[Samoan language]]. English and Cook Islands Māori are [[official language]]s of the Cook Islands; per the [http://www.paclii.org/ck/legis/num_act/trma2003130/ Te Reo Maori Act]. The legal definition of Cook Islands Māori includes Pukapukan.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Music===
{{Main|Music of the Cook Islands}}
Music in the Cook Islands is varied, with Christian songs being quite popular, but traditional dancing and songs in Polynesian languages remain popular.

====Carving====
[[File:Cook Islands carved wood figure, British Museum.jpg|thumb|This wooden late eighteenth or early nineteenth century carved [[Deity Figure from Rarotonga|figure]] escaped [[emasculation]]. Only one other comparable example is known apart from this one in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/standing-male-figure/iAEuMZBGSYaByg |title=Standing male figure – Google Arts &amp; Culture |website=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]

[[Woodcarving]] is a common art form in the Cook Islands. The proximity of islands in the southern group helped produce a homogeneous style of carving but that had special developments in each island. Rarotonga is known for its fisherman's gods and staff-gods, [[Atiu]] for its wooden seats, [[Mitiaro]], [[Mauke]] and Atiu for mace and slab gods and [[Mangaia]] for its ceremonial adzes. Most of the original wood carvings were either spirited away by early European collectors or were burned in large numbers by missionaries. Today, carving is no longer the major art form with the same spiritual and cultural emphasis given to it by the Maori in New Zealand. However, there are continual efforts to interest young people in their heritage and some good work is being turned out under the guidance of older carvers. Atiu, in particular, has a strong tradition of crafts both in carving and local fibre arts such as tapa. Mangaia is the source of many fine adzes carved in a distinctive, idiosyncratic style with the so-called double-k design. Mangaia also produces food pounders carved from the heavy calcite found in its extensive limestone caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ck/culture.htm#visual |title=Lords of the Dance : Culture of the Cook Islands|publisher=Ck|date=2013-11-12|accessdate=2016-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Weaving====
The outer islands produce traditional [[weaving]] of mats, basketware and hats. Particularly fine examples of rito hats are worn by women to church. They are made from the uncurled immature fibre of the coconut palm and are of very high quality. The Polynesian equivalent of Panama hats, they are highly valued and are keenly sought by Polynesian visitors from Tahiti. Often, they are decorated with hatbands made of minuscule pupu shells that are painted and stitched on by hand. Although pupu are found on other islands the collection and use of them in decorative work has become a speciality of Mangaia. The weaving of rito is a speciality of the northern islands, Manihiki, Rakahanga and Penrhyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ck/culture.htm#crafts |title=Lords of the Dance : Culture of the Cook Islands |publisher=Ck |date=2013-11-12|accessdate=2016-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tivaevae====
A major art form in the Cook Islands is [[tivaevae]]. This is, in essence, the art of handmade Island scenery patchwork quilts. Introduced by the wives of missionaries in the 19th century, the craft grew into a communal activity, which is probably one of the main reasons for its popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ck/tivaevae.htm |title=Tivaevae – Quilts of the Cook Islands |publisher=Ck |date=2004-07-15 |accessdate=2016-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary art====
The Cook Islands has produced internationally recognised contemporary artists, especially in the main island of Rarotonga. Artists include painter (and photographer) Mahiriki Tangaroa, sculptors Eruera (Ted) Nia (originally a film maker) and master carver Mike Tavioni, painter (and Polynesian tattoo enthusiast) Upoko'ina Ian George, Aitutakian-born painter Tim Manavaroa Buchanan, Loretta Reynolds, Judith Kunzlé, Joan Rolls Gragg, Kay George (who is also known for her fabric designs), Apii Rongo, Varu Samuel, and multi-media, installation and community-project artist [[Ani O'Neill]], all of whom currently live on the main island of Rarotonga. Atiuan-based Andrea Eimke is an artist who works in the medium of tapa and other textiles, and also co-authored the book 'Tivaivai – The Social Fabric of the Cook Islands' with British academic [[Susanne Kuechler]]. Many of these artists have studied at university art schools in New Zealand and continue to enjoy close links with the New Zealand art scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cook Islands Arts Community|url=http://cookislandsarts.com|website=Cookislandsarts.com|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand-based Cook Islander artists include [[Michel Tuffery]], print-maker David Teata, Richard Shortland Cooper, Sylvia Marsters and [[Jim Vivieaere]].

The '''County of Calvelage''' existed at the end of the 11th century and in the first half of the 12th century in the region of [[Vechta]] in [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]].

The Court of Kalvelage in the farming community of Brockdorf in [[Lohne, Germany|Lohne]] provided the name for the county. The name disappeared in the 17th century, when it was changed to "Brockdorf" by the lords of the manor from the ''[[von Galen]]'' family, who were responsible for the area.

The counts of Calvelage, who had property in [[Vechta]] and [[Bersenbrück]], acquired areas in [[Teutoburg Forest]] northwest of [[Halle, North Rhine-Westphalia|Halle]] around 1100 and erected [[Ravensberg Castle]]. They moved their main residence to the new castle around 1140 and called themselves [[County of Ravensberg|Counts of Ravensberg]] from then on.

Counts of Calvelage:
*Hermann I, died probably in 1082, Count of Calvelage; after 1070 he married [[Ethelinde of Northeim]], daughter of [[Otto of Northeim]], 1061-1070 [[Rulers of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]], after he had been deposed and his daughter had been repudiated by his son-in-law and successor, [[Welf I, Duke of Bavaria]] 1070-1101 ([[House of Welf|Welf]]).
*Hermann von Calvelage, documented to have lived 1115-1134, their son, count in 1120, Count of Calvelage in 1125.
*Otto I, documented to have lived 1140-1170, probably his first son, first Count of Ravensberg; married to Oda, documented to have lived in 1166.

[[File:DarkHero.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[William Collins, Sons|Collins]])]]
'''''Dark Hero''''' is a 1946 [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] by [[Peter Cheyney]] featuring a [[Chicago#20th century|Chicago]] gangster involved in the [[Saint Valentine's Day massacre|gang war]]s of the 1930s, who during the [[Second World War]] finds himself in [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|Nazi-occupied Norway]] and becomes a hero of the [[milorg|anti-Nazi resistance]] - by applying essentially the same skills which had made him a successful and feared gangster. 

The book's [[nonlinear narrative]] shifts and jumps back and forth between pre-war Chicago, wartime Norway, the Nazi [[concentration camp]] where the protagonist ended after being captured by the [[Gestapo]], and [[History of London#London 1945-2000|London]] in the immediate aftermath of the war - where he seeks to exact deadly revenge on those who betrayed him to the Nazis. Events and characters from the different periods - and in  particular, the different women in the protagonist's life - constantly interweave and influence each other in unexpected ways.

The '''Despot Stefan Tower''' ({{lang-sr|Деспотова кула}}; ''Despotova kula'') or '''Dizdar Tower''' (Диздарева кула; ''Dizdareva kula'')  is a structure in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]], built ca. 1405, a couple of years after the city became the capital of [[Serbian Despotate]] under [[Despot (court title)|Despot]] [[Stefan Lazarević]].

In May 1963, representatives of the city administration, Institute for the protection of the cultural monuments and members of the astronomical societies, agreed to adapt the Dizdar Tower into an observatory. Works began in May, instruments were to be installed by autumn, and the observatory was to become operational in October 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = | title = Urediće se Narodna Opservatorija na Kalemegdanu | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = 9 May 2017 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the tower is the seat of the [[Astronomical Society Ruđer Bošković]] and houses its Popular Observatory. The Observatory has two instruments: refractor Zeiss (110/2200mm) and reflector Tall 200 K (200/2200mm), both of which are used mainly for observations at night. Four panoramic telescopes are also mounted on the tower, which can be used to observe the panorama of Belgrade.&lt;ref&gt;http://adrb.org/index.php?lang=en&amp;page=observatory&lt;/ref&gt;

Eric's height was cited at between {{height|ft=3|in=0}} and {{height|ft=3|in=5}}, which is within the threshold to be considered to have [[dwarfism]]. Because of his short legs and a [[club foot]], he employed a wheelchair to get around. His other afflictions included [[stork bite]] which gave him a "blotchy" complexion&lt;ref&gt;[http://howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1238040000#13723 Hot but not bothered – The Howard Stern Show].

[[Image:Karta ID RajaAmpat Isl.PNG|thumb|300px|Gag and the Raja Ampat Islands]]
'''Gag Island''' is one of the [[Raja Ampat Islands]] in the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]]. It is situated some 150 kilometres west of [[Sorong (city)|Sorong]], the provincial capital.

The island's population is approximately 450 living at [[Gambier Bay]]. This community was established in the early 1960s by people moving to the island in the hope of finding work with [[nickel]] exploration ventures at that time.

==Economy==
PT Gag Nikel is company formed in 1996 as a joint venture agreement between [[BHP Billiton]] (75%) and Indonesia's state-owned mining company, PT [[Aneka Tambang]] Tbk (25%). A [[contract of work]] was awarded in February 1998, and a program of exploration and preliminary evaluation was conducted. In late 1999, the Indonesian government enacted a [[Forest Principles|forestry law]] prohibiting open cast mining in "protection forest" areas. The forest on Gag Island was subsequently reclassified as "protection forest", stopping any mining activity on the island. Subsequent to these events, the Contract of Work for Gag Island was suspended. No exploration work on the island has been undertaken since late 1999.

== Reception ==
Hahdhu received mixed reviews from critics. Aishath Maaha of ''Avas'' praised the performance of Azza and Rishfa while she criticised Shiban's acting in his debut film. Though the screenplay by Ahmed was favored, she noticed some "loopholes that restricted character development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/38237 |title=Review" Praising 'Hahdhu" in a limit |language=Dhivehi |work=Avas |last=Maaha |first=Aishath|date=8 September 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327062618/https://avas.mv/38237 |deadurl=no |archivedate=27 March 2018 |accessdate=27 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hotel Africa''' is a hotel on the western coast of [[Liberia]] in the northern [[Monrovia]] suburb of [[Virginia, Liberia|Virginia]].

In 1979, the hotel, the largest in Liberia, hosted the [[Organisation of African Unity]] conference. The conference was led by President [[William R. Tolbert, Jr.]] who was the group's chair at the time, just months before he was overthrown by [[Samuel Doe]].&lt;ref name="Huband1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Huband|first=Mark|title=The Liberian Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X1BVJZMDYMwC&amp;pg=PA180|accessdate=28 April 2012|date=30 June 1998|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7146-4785-2|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Liberian Civil War, many pilots of Russian and Ukrainian origin stayed at the hotel.&lt;ref name="Williams2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Gabriel I.

A South African consortium had plans to invest US$100 million to renovate the historic hotel in time for Liberia's hosting duties of an international women's colloquium in 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3223">The '''International Freedom Alliance''' ('''IFA''') ({{lang-nl|alliantie van internationale vrijheid}}) was a proposed group announced in July 2010 by Dutch politician [[Geert Wilders]]. 

==History==

Wilders has stated that the IFA will be an umbrella organization for groups and individuals who "are fighting for freedom against Islam".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/7180827/__Wilders_werkt_aan_netwerk__.html "Wilders begint internationale beweging"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pvv.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3476:wilders-werkt-aan-internationaal-netwerk "Wilders werkt aan internationaal netwerk"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geertwilders.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1701&amp;Itemid=1 "APNewsBreak: Dutch lawmaker forms anti-Islam group "]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/wilders-sets-international-alliance-against-islam "Wilders sets up international alliance against Islam"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pattayadailynews.com/en/2010/07/17/dutch-politician-plans-on-global-spread-of-anti-islam-party/ "Dutch Politician Plans on Global Spread of Anti-Islam Party"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924130521/http://www.pattayadailynews.com/en/2010/07/17/dutch-politician-plans-on-global-spread-of-anti-islam-party/ |date=2010-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Geert-Wilders-Anti-Muslim-Freedom-Alliance-Dutch-Politician-Wants-End-To-Islamic-Immigration/Article/201007315666139 "Dutch Politician Forms Anti-Islam Coalition"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1295047/Dutch-politician-says-UK-freedom-alliance-countries-Islam.html "Anti-Islamic crusader launches  recruitment drive in UK"]&lt;/ref&gt; His goal is an international alliance to end immigration of [[Islam]]ic nationals to the West and a complete ban of [[Sharia law]].

Wilders had planned to set up IFA branches in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]] and [[Germany]] by late 2010, but it is likely that his trial delayed these plans. "The message, 'stop Islam, defend freedom', is a message that's not only important for the Netherlands but for the whole free Western world," Wilders stated in an address to reporters at the Dutch Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/294757 "Dutch politician to form international anti-Muslim Coalition"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jihadwatch.org/2010/07/geert-wilderss-international-freedom-alliance.html "Geert Wilders's International Freedom Alliance!"]&lt;/ref&gt; Wilders has also stated the new organization will not include any right-wing extremists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/7180827__Wilders_werkt_aan_netwerk__.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Campraven.jpg|thumb|250px|Jamesway hut at [[Camp Raven]] station in [[Greenland]].]]

The '''Jamesway hut''' is a portable and easy-to-assemble [[hut]], designed for [[arctic]] weather conditions. This version of the [[Quonset hut]] was created by [[James Manufacturing Company]] of [[Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin]]. A Jamesway hut had wooden ribs and an insulated fabric covering for the Army Air Corps. Insulated blankets in 1.2&amp;nbsp;m (3&amp;nbsp;ft 11&amp;nbsp;in)-wide lengths were made with [[glass fiber]] insulation faced with flame-proof [[muslin]] and enclosed in plastic-treated [[cotton]] that was water-, vermin-, and fire-proof. The hardware (nails, fasteners, and connecting bars) was the only metal component. The whole package weighed 540&amp;nbsp;kg (1,190&amp;nbsp;lb) for a 5 metres (16&amp;nbsp;ft)-square hut. Its wooden packing [[crate]]s were designed for reuse as the hut [[floor]].

The storage/floor sections, each {{convert|1.2|by|2.4|m|abbr=on}} were made from plywood and insulated with R-7 fiberglass insulation, which provided a portable, warm and cleanable floor. The wooden arches holding up the roof were attached to the floor sections with steel fittings and wing nuts, and were strong enough to hold a winter’s snow. The arches, the key to the design, were curved, glue-laminated wooden {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} beams on {{convert|1.2|m|abbr=on|0}} centers that folded in quarters on steel hinges and removable pins.

The hut became famous for providing portable warmth and shelter for the U.S. Armed Forces when the Japanese invaded the far [[Aleutian Islands]] in Alaska during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9_bgaZyjnJkC&amp;pg=PA413&amp;lpg=PA413&amp;dq=%22jamesway%22+huts+attu&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l2C8ziRycz&amp;sig=-6qZm0MeyWd7kqvM2Lt2SopR-ro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QAuuU5eFJcnmsATp6oJ4&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jamesway%22%20huts%20attu&amp;f=false ''Thousand-Mile War: World War II in Alaska and the Aleutians'', p. 413], Brian Garfield, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; More huts were manufactured in the late 1940s for use in the Korean War; many of these have been used by the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) from the initial [[Operation Deep Freeze]] operation from 1956–1961 in support of the International Geophysical Year (IGY), up to the present time.

}}'''KTBN''' (formerly known as '''KUSW''') was the [[shortwave radio]] outlet of the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]], a large [[religious broadcasting|religious]] [[International broadcasting|international broadcaster]]. The station's programming was a simulcast of the audio portion of the TBN television service.

==History==
KUSW, which was also branded "The Superpower", officially launched on December 26, 1987 during the peak years of the American commercial shortwave broadcasting boom triggered by the founding of [[WRNO (shortwave)|WRNO Worldwide]]. Owned by Carlson Communications International, which owned a network of AM and FM stations in Utah, Nevada, and Arizona,&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; KUSW broadcast a combination of news and rock music.  The station also offered a mail-order catalog of products made in the Rocky Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Carlson sold the station to the TBN ministry in 1990 for approximately $2 million.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berg, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; The station signed off under its old format on December 16 of that year, to be relaunched under the KTBN callsign two days later.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{Citation

After its final sign-off, the station equipment, including the transmitter and antenna array, was dismantled and shipped to [[Anguilla]] in the Caribbean to be incorporated into the [[Caribbean Beacon]] radio station.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

'''Kobeniak''' (Кобеняк) is a Ukrainian traditional male [[outer garment]]. A similar terms are Hungarian ''[[:wikt:köpönyeg|köpönyeg]]'' for "cloak", "mantle", "[[overcoat]]", and a historical Polish garment, [[kopieniak]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Encyklopedia_staropolska/Kopieniak |title=Encyklopedia staropolska/Kopieniak - Wikiźródła, teksty i materiały źródłowe |language=pl |publisher=Pl.wikisource.org |date=2014-02-06 |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; all terms being derived from the Turkish garment [[kepenek]], which is a shepherd's garment. Kobeniak is also called '''burka''' (cf. "[[Burka (Caucasus)]]"), '''kireya''', or '''siryak''' (бурка, кирея, сіряк).&lt;ref name=vovk&gt;Вовк, Хведір. "Студії з української етнографії та антропології",  Прага : Укр. громад. вид. фонд, [1916?] (Publ. «Легіографія»). — 354pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

A kobenyak was the widest garment, so that it could be worn even on top of a ''[[kozhukh]]'' (fur coat). A distinctive feature is a [[hood (headgear)|hood]] which could cover nearly all the face, with a cut for the eyes and possibly for the mouth, which may be folded back.&lt;ref name=vovk/&gt;

:''For the Canadian service, see [[NHL Centre Ice]]''.

[[Image:NHL Center Ice.svg|right|200px]]'''NHL Center Ice''' is an [[Out-of-Market Sports Package]] distributed by most cable and satellite providers in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The package allows its subscribers to see up to forty out-of-market [[National Hockey League]] games a week using local and national television networks.

NHL Center Ice includes Canadian broadcasts, such as [[SportsNet|NHL on Sportsnet]] and [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s [[Hockey Night in Canada]]. It also has included out-of-region games broadcast on [[NHL on NBC|NBC]]. Occasionally, French-language feeds from [[TVA Sports]] may be used if no English-language broadcast is available. [[Pay-per-view]] games (e.g. [[Edmonton Oilers]]) are included as well.  For some cable viewers and those subscribing via [[Dish Network]] or [[DirecTV]], both teams' feeds are available for most games. Other cable subscribers may be limited to only one feed and also have a smaller selection of high-definition games.

Some providers offer [[high-definition television|high definition]] broadcasts when available.  A number of providers put Center Ice on the same channels as [[MLB Extra Innings]]; hockey often gets priority because the conflict occurs during April, at the end of the regular season and beginning of the playoffs.

A free preview is usually shown during the first three weeks of the NHL season and right after (or a few weeks after) the [[NHL All-Star Game|All Star Game]] (or, until 2014, [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|the Olympic break in years when the Winter Olympics occur]]).

==Games not televised on NHL Center Ice==
*Games which are nationally televised in the U.S. on [[NBC]], [[NBCSN]] or [[NHL Network (United States)|NHL Network]]. (But subscribers get NHL Network for free when they buy Center Ice, unless they subscribe through Time Warner Cable (TWC) or Verizon Fios, which at this time do not include NHL Network as part of the Center Ice package. )
*High-definition feeds of games originating on [[MSG (TV network)|MSG]], [[MSG+]], [[MSG Western New York]], MSG2, and MSG+2 on Dish Network
*[[Terrestrial television|OTA]] Broadcasts (Only shown when it is the only broadcast available for that game). 
*[[WGN-TV]] games do show up on Centre Ice Canada and are not [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blacked]] out on WGN-TV in Canada. Some WGN-TV games air on Center Ice USA if they are the only feed available, and some WGN-TV games do show up on NHL Network in the U.S. Beginning with the 2014–15 season, DirecTV has started to use WGN-TV HD to show games where dual feeds are available and/or as the only Center Ice feed for that game.
*[[Réseau des sports|RDS]] and RDS2 (French-speaking Canadiens broadcast); these broadcasts are shown only when there isn't an English broadcast available.

==Availability==
NHL Center Ice is available with these cable and satellite providers:
* [[Adams Cable]]
* [[Bright House Networks]]
* [[Blue Ridge Communications]]
* [[Cablevision]]
* [[Charter Communications]]
* [[Comcast]] – part owner
* [[Cox Communications]] – part owner
* [[DirecTV]]
* [[Dish Network]]
* [[Frontier Communications]]
* [[In Demand|iN DEMAND]]
* [[Midcontinent Communications]]
* [[RCN Corporation|RCN]]
* [[Summit Broadband]]
* [[Time Warner]] – part owner
* [[Verizon FiOS]]

==Blackout restrictions==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
NHL Center Ice blackouts, as with other sports packages, are intended to protect the rights of the league's national, regional, and local broadcast partners.

In the United States, games broadcast by NBC or NBC Sports Network (formerly Versus) are not included in the NHL Center Ice package.  Additionally, NBC has been granted an exclusive window by the league, during which no other games can be televised in the United States.  During this window, other games may be televised locally only by Canadian teams.  For instance, if the Edmonton Oilers are playing the [[Nashville Predators]] at the same time NBC is televising another game, the Oilers may choose to broadcast the game locally (on [[Sportsnet]] West, for example), but the Predators are not permitted to televise the game.  Additionally, the game would be available on NHL Center Ice in Canada, but not in the United States.  The NBC blackout window typically lasts 2.5 hours from the start of its Game of the Week broadcast.  Games televised by NBC Sports Network are designated as exclusive or non-exclusive for blackout purposes.  Exclusive broadcasts generally occur on Monday and Tuesday nights during the regular season.  During these games, NBC Sports Network has an exclusive window similar to NBC, which usually lasts 2 or 2.5 hours from the start of the NBC Sports Network telecast.  No other games may be televised in the United States during this time.  Canadian teams may choose to air these games, and unlike the NBC exclusive window, the Canadian local telecasts are included in the U.S. NHL Center Ice package.  During non-exclusive NBC Sports Network telecasts, other teams may televise their games, but the NBC Sports Network game may not be locally televised.

Local/regional broadcast restrictions depend on the Center Ice subscriber's physical location.  Every location in the United States and Canada falls in the territory of at least one NHL team, and some areas fall in multiple team territories.  Additionally, each team may choose to televise its games on a [[regional sports network]] (RSN), local broadcast/over-the-air (OTA) station, or can choose not to televise them.  In cases where the local team broadcasts on an RSN (i.e. [[Fox Sports Networks|FSN]], Comcast, [[New England Sports Network|NESN]], etc.), Center Ice subscribers in the team's territory will be blacked out of the opposing team's broadcast and must watch the game on the local RSN.  (Example: The [[Boston Bruins]] are playing the [[St. Louis Blues]].  The Bruins are televising on NESN, and the Blues are televising on FSN Midwest.  Viewers in Bruins territory will be blacked out of the FSN Midwest feed and must watch the game on NESN.)  In cases where the local team broadcasts on an OTA station (i.e. [[KPLR-TV|KPLR-TV St. Louis]], [[KDFI]] Dallas, etc.), Center Ice subscribers who live within a 50-mile radius of the team's arena (regardless of whether the team is home or away) will be blacked out from the Center Ice feed of the game.  Viewers who live in the team's territory but outside the 50 mile radius will not be blacked out from the Center Ice broadcast.  (Example: The [[Dallas Stars]] are playing the [[Chicago Blackhawks]].  The Stars are televising on KDFI, an OTA station, while the Blackhawks are televising on [[NBC Sports Chicago]].  A viewer who lives in Stars territory, but more than 50 miles from the Stars' arena, will not be blacked out of the NBC Sports Chicago feed.  A viewer in Stars territory who lives within the 50 mile radius will be blacked out of the Blackhawks feed and must watch the game on KDFI.)  If a team chooses not to televise a game locally, that team may choose to lift the Center Ice blackout.  Many teams announce at the start of the regular season that all games not televised locally will not be blacked out on NHL Center Ice, while others make decisions on a case-by-case basis near the date of the game.  (Example: The [[Florida Panthers]] are hosting the [[Ottawa Senators]].  The Senators are televising on Sportsnet East, but the Panthers are not televising the game locally.  Viewers in Panthers territory will not be blacked out of the Senators feed, provided that the Panthers have approved a blackout lift for the game).

On some Canadian cable systems, WGN-TV broadcasts of Chicago Blackhawks games are not blacked out in the local market of the opponent. (Note: WGN broadcasts of Blackhawks games are not available on [[WGN America]] in the U.S., but WGN-TV's Chicago-area signal is available throughout Canada.)

In rare events, should there not be a televised broadcast of either market, an in-house arena feed will be broadcast with the home team's radio broadcast as the audio. This is subject on a case-by-case basis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12219">In [[international relations]], '''non-state actors''' ('''NSAs''') are individuals or groups that hold influence and which are wholly or partly independent of [[State government|state governments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/non-state_actor|title=non-state actor {{!}} Definition of non-state actor in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interests, structure, and influence of NSAs vary widely. For example, among NSAs are [[Corporation|corporations]], [[Mass media|media organizations]], [[Business magnate|business magnates]], [[Liberation movements|people's liberation movements]], [[Advocacy group|lobby groups]], [[Religion|religious groups]], [[Aid agency|aid agencies]], and [[Violent non-state actor|violent non-state actors]] such as [[Paramilitary|paramilitary forces]].

==Types ==
Some common and influential classes of NSAs are listed here in alphabetical order:
* [[Business magnate|Business magnates]] are individuals who command large wealth, and who often seek to influence national and international affairs. Examples are [[Warren Buffett]] and [[Bill Gates]].
* [[Corporation|Corporations]], which include [[multinational corporations]] (MNCs), are [[Company|companies]] authorized to act as single entities ([[Legal personality|legally as persons]]) and are recognized as such in law. They include very large businesses operating transnationally, such as [[The Coca-Cola Company]].
* [[Decentralized autonomous organization]]s (DAO)s, sometimes known as decentralized autonomous corporations (DACs), operate according to rules encoded as computer programs called [[smart contracts]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3082055 The Decentralized Autonomous Organization and Governance Issues.] ''Regulation of Financial Institutions Journal'': Social Science Research Network (SSRN). 5 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|229}} The [[Cryptocurrency|crypto-currency]] [[Bitcoin]] is an example of a DAO which, as of 2018, has grown to become economically influential.
* [[Mass media|International media agencies]], which are also usually corporations, report on the social and political situation in countries worldwide, and may therefore be highly influential as NSAs. [[Agence France-Presse]] is an example.
* [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), which include [[International non-governmental organization|international non-governmental organizations]] (INGOs), are usually [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] organizations seeking to effect change in humanitarian, educational, ecological, healthcare, public policy, social, human rights, environmental, and other areas. An example is [[Greenpeace]]. [[Goodwill ambassador]]s or humanitarian aid workers involved with INGO missions abroad may also be considered as non-state actors.
* [[Liberation movement|People's movements]] are mass movements which become influential with size and longevity. Examples include the movements arising during the [[Arab Spring]] of 2011.
* Religious groups commonly engage in political affairs at an international level. For example, the [[Quakers]], as an [[Peace churches|historic peace church]], operate offices at the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quno.org|title=QUNO {{!}} Quaker United Nations Office|website=www.quno.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rochester"&gt;Rochester, Martin J. ''Between Two Epochs: What’s Ahead for America, the World, and Global Politics in the Twenty-First Century''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[ISIS]], which is a religious group as well as a violent non-state actor.
* [[Diaspora politics|Transnational diaspora communities]] are ethnic or national communities that commonly seek to bring social and political change to their originating countries and their adoptive countries. The [[Yerida|Israeli diaspora]] is an example.
* Unincorporated associations, secret societies and civic organizations unknown to or unrecognized by the state or government may be considered non-state actors. 
* [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization|Unrepresented nations and peoples]] include many [[indigenous peoples]] and [[Fourth world|Fourth World]] societies. 
* [[Violent non-state actor]]s (VNSA)s are armed groups, including groups such as [[ISIS]] or criminal organizations, for example [[drug cartel]]s.
* [[Global citizenship|World citizen]]s may be considered non-state actors if they are active in movements or social causes active outside their own country.

==Effects on the Westphalian state model==
The proliferation of non-state actors in the post–[[Cold War]] era has been one of the factors leading to the Cobweb Paradigm in international politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Impact of Non-State Actors on World Politics: A Challenge to Nation States|url=http://dergipark.gov.tr/download/article-file/19401|publisher=Muhittin Ataman|accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this [[wikt:paradigm|paradigm]], the traditional [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian]] [[nation-state]] experiences an erosion of power and sovereignty, and non-state actors are part of the cause. Facilitated by [[globalization]], NSAs challenge nation-state borders and sovereignty claims. MNCs are not always sympathetic to [[national interest]]s, but instead are loyal to the corporation's interests. NSAs challenge the nation-state's sovereignty over internal matters through advocacy for societal issues, e.g. [[human rights]] and the environment.&lt;ref name="Rochester" /&gt;

Armed non-state actors operate without state control and are involved in internal and trans-border conflicts. The activity of such groups in armed conflicts adds layers of complexity to traditional conflict management and resolution. These conflicts are often fought not only between non-state actors and states, but also between multiple NSA groups. Interventions in such conflicts is particularly challenging given the fact that [[international law]] and norms governing the use of force for intervention or [[peacekeeping]] purposes was primarily written in the context of the nation-state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-State Actors in Conflict|url=http://archives.sipri.org/contents/conflict/nonstateactors.html/view?searchterm=Non-State%20Actors%20in%20Conflict|work=SIPRI Archive|publisher=Stockholm International Peace Research Institute|accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example: Cotonou Agreement==
The term Non State Actors is widely used in [[development cooperation]], particularly under the [[Cotonou Agreement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview, The Cotonou Agreement|url=http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/where/acp/overview/cotonou-agreement/index_en.htm|work=The Cotonou Agreement|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=11 June 2012|date=10 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214145842/http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/where/acp/overview/cotonou-agreement/index_en.htm|archivedate=14 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the [[European Union]] (EU) and African, Caribbean and Pacific [[ACP countries]]. The agreement uses the term to refer to a wide range of nongovernmental development actors whose participation in [[ACP-EU development cooperation]] is now formally recognized. According to Article 6, non-state actors include:

* civil society in all its diversity, according to national characteristics;
* economic and social partners, including trade union organisations and;
* the private sector.

In practice, it means that [[participation (decision making)|participation]] is open to all kind of actors, such as community-based organisations, women's groups, [[human rights]] associations, [[non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs), religious organizations, farmers' [[cooperatives]], [[trade union]]s, [[universities]] and research institutes, the media and the private sector. Also included in this definition are informal groups such as [[Grassroots|grassroots organizations]], informal private sector associations, etc. The private sector, however, is considered only insofar as it is involved in non-profit activities (e.g. private sector associations, chambers of commerce, etc.)

==Roles==
Non-state actors can aid in opinion building in international affairs, such as the [[Human Rights Council]]. Formal international organizations may also rely on non-state actors, particularly NGOs in the form of implementing partners in the national context. An example is the contribution of [[COHRE]] (Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions), to the protection of land and property (HLP) rights in [[Kosovo]] by conceptualizing the Housing and Property Directorate (now Kosovo Property Agency) within the framework of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;K. Hassine, Regularizing Property Rights in Kosovo and Elsewhere, 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-86553-340-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-state actors are fundamental agents in helping to achieve both national and international development goals, such as those around climate change. Actions by non-state actors contribute significantly towards filling the greenhouse gas emissions gap left by unambitious or poorly executed national climate policies, [[Intended Nationally Determined Contributions]] (INDCs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/coordination-and-vertical-integration-of-climate-actions/?loclang=en_gb|title=Coordinating climate action: From the national to the local|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example that shows the importance of non-state actors in peace-building is the contribution of [[ICBL]] (International Campaign to Ban Landmines) to the international prohibition on the use of landmines. ICBL is a global network of NGOs that has operated in over 90 countries since 1992. Its primary goal is to make a world free of [[Anti-personnel mine|anti-personnel landmines]]. Their passionate advertising appealing for global cooperation drew [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] to become an ardent advocate. Together, they brought the issue to the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. ICBL's efforts led the international community to urge states to ratify the [[Ottawa Treaty]] (Mine Ban Treaty) in 1997, and its contribution was recognized and praised as it was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.icbl.org/index.php/icbl/About-Us|work=The International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL)|publisher=The International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL)|accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nordic Passport Union''' allows [[citizens]] of the [[Nordic countries]]{{snd}}[[Iceland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], and [[Finland]]{{snd}}to travel and reside in another Nordic country (excluding [[Greenland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sullissivik.gl/Emner/Politi_og_retsvaesen/Pas?sc_lang=da-dk&amp;mupid=0+ |title=Pas |website=Sullissivik.gl |date= |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Svalbard]]) without any travel documentation (e.g. a [[passport]] or [[national identity card]]) or a residence permit. Since 25 March 2001, all five states have also been within the [[Schengen Area]]. The [[Faroe Islands]] are part of the Nordic Passport Union&lt;ref&gt;Since 1 January 1966&lt;/ref&gt; but not the Schengen Area, while Greenland and Svalbard are outside both.
However, Greenland has an open border with all Nordic countries, and allows Nordic citizens to enter, settle and work without requiring a passport or permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/coming_to_dk/greenland/family-reunification.htm#GF1 |title=New to Denmark - Family reunification |website=Nyidanmark.dk |date=2001-02-23 |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Svalbard allows Nordic citizens to settle and work without permits, as a result of the [[Svalbard Treaty]], however with the exception of Norwegian citizens, valid travel documentation (such as a passport, or a national identity card from a [[European Union]] or [[EFTA]] country) is required to enter Svalbard. Furthermore, as citizens of a Nordic country, those from Svalbard and Greenland are permitted to reside in any other Nordic country.

For Nordic citizens, no [[identity document]]ation is legally required to enter or reside in any Nordic country. However, identity documentation is still useful, as companies may require proof of identity for certain services, such as trains, airports, and age check for alcohol purchase. Usually any valid proof of identity is accepted, such as a driver licence. For services aimed at residents, like banking, picking up postal packages or dealing with authorities, sometimes only local identity documentation, along with passports and national identity cards, are accepted.

== Establishment ==
The Nordic Passport Union was established in three stages. In 1952, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland agreed to abolish passports for travel between them and to readmit citizens of other countries who had entered illegally into one of the four countries from another. On 1 July 1954, the agreement was extended to allow citizens to reside and work in any of the four countries without a residence or work permit. [[Iceland]] implemented the agreement on 1 January 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.althingi.is/altext/123/s/1231.html|title=1231/123 svar: aðild að alþjóðastofnunum og alþjóðasamningum|website=Alþingi|language=is|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.althingi.is/altext/118/s/0807.html|title=807/118 svar: aðild að alþjóðastofnunum og alþjóðasamningum|website=Alþingi|language=is|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passport checks for citizens of non-member countries at the borders between member countries were removed by a treaty between Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland signed on 12 July 1957 and which came into force on 1 May 1958. The treaty was extended to Iceland on 24 September 1965 and to the [[Faroe Islands]] on 1 January 1966. Greenland and Svalbard remain outside the passport union.

== Nordic countries and Schengen ==

In December 1996 the two non-EU member states [[Norway]] and [[Iceland]] signed an association agreement with the signatories of the [[Schengen Agreement]] to become part of the [[Schengen Area]]. While this agreement never came into force, both countries did become part of the Schengen Area after concluding similar agreements with the EU. The Schengen Convention itself was not open for signature by non-EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;Article 140 of the Schengen Convention.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 25 March 2001, the [[Schengen acquis|Schengen ''acquis'']] applied to the area of the Nordic Passport Union with the exception of the [[Faroe Islands]]. [[Border checkpoint]]s have been removed within the Schengen Area, in addition to those that had been abolished previously within the Nordic Passport Union. In the case of the Faroe Islands, which are not part of  the Schengen Area but remain part of the Nordic Area, the strict Schengen rules apply to travellers from the Faroe Islands into the Schengen Area, including the Nordic countries, but the Nordic rules allowing for an open border apply to those going the other way from the Nordic countries, but not necessarily from the other Schengen countries. However, citizens of the Nordic Passport Union countries enjoy extra rights within the Nordic area, not available under Schengen, such as less paperwork if moving to a different Nordic country, and fewer requirements for [[naturalization]] or [[citizenship]]. Within the Nordic area, any Nordic identity documentation (e.g. a [[driving license]]) is valid as proof of identity for Nordic citizens because of the Nordic Passport Union, while a national identity card or a passport is can be required in other Schengen countries. Most Scandinavian people do not own any Schengen approved national ID card, so they need a passport when visiting most Schengen countries outside the Nordic area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://polisen.se/Service/Pass-och-id-kort/Resor-inom-EU/ |title=Resor inom EU - Service |website=Polisen.se |date=2016-09-13 |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; having in mind that most Schengen countries on the continent require possession of identity documentation by anyone, generally checked by hotels.

Before 2001, full customs checks were required for ferry travel when travelling from Denmark to other Nordic countries. There was no land border with Denmark before July 2000 when the [[Öresund Bridge]] was opened, which had relaxed customs check from the start. Nordic citizens did not need to be in possession of a passport. {{Cn|date=May 2017}} Other citizens needed a passport. As a part of the customs check, at least when arriving from Denmark and non-Nordic countries, every car driver was asked about where they had been. For land and ferry travel into Denmark and between Sweden, Norway and Finland, there were much more relaxed customs and passport checks, and often no checks at all. {{Cn|date=May 2017}} For air travel, there were full passport and customs checks, even though verbally claiming Nordic citizenship with a Scandinavian language, plus showing the ticket for the intra-Nordic flight, or any Nordic identity documentation, was usually enough to pass the passport check. It happened that Nordic citizens without a passport were not allowed to pass until a thorough identity investigation had been made. Passengers travelling by public transport, such as train or air, were usually not interviewed by the customs control. {{Cn|date=July 2017}}

From March 2001, the Schengen rules have given more relaxed customs checks from Denmark, including no passport checks at airports, since intra-Schengen travellers are separated from the travellers from outside the Schengen area. Still laws give police and guards the right to demand an identity document at airports&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/skyddslag-2010305_sfs-2010-305 Skyddslag (2010:305)] 10 § , 12 § in Sweden and similar laws in other countries&lt;/ref&gt; which is usually not enforced inside Nordic countries, at least not before 2015.

==Agreements==
===Abolition of passport for Nordic citizens===
The protocol concerning the abolition of passports for travel between Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | website = United nations treaty collection | title = Protocol concerning the abolition of passports for travel between Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway | url = http://untreaty.un.org/unts/1_60000/5/30/00009491.pdf | accessdate = 2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; was signed on 14 July 1952, in [[Stockholm]].

This protocol was implemented by the individual but concurrent decisions of the four governments. It abolished the need for citizens of the four countries to carry a passport when travelling in the three other countries provided that the trip was for such a short time that a residence permit was not necessary.

The agreement could be revoked in case of war, danger of war, or extraordinary international or national circumstances.

On 26 July 2014 the Norwegian police for the first time suspended this agreement due to a perceived terrorist threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website= The Nordic Page |title= Norway Police Requires Passports or ID Cards for Even Norwegian and Schengen Area Citizens |url= http://www.tnp.no/norway/panorama/4549-norway-police-requires-passports-or-id-cards-for-even-norwegian-and-schengen-area-citizens | accessdate = 2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Readmittance of aliens===

The agreement for the readmittance of aliens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | website = United nations treaty collection | title = Agreement for readmittance of aliens who have illegally entered the territory of another contracting party | url = http://untreaty.un.org/unts/1_60000/5/30/00009492.pdf | accessdate = 2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; was signed on 14 July 1952, in [[Stockholm]].

The agreement provides that any alien, i.e. persons not citizens of the Nordic countries, having illegally entered one of the Nordic countries directly from another Nordic country should be readmitted by that country, unless that person has stayed at least a year in that country or has received either a residence or [[work permit]].

===Exemption of passport or residence permit===

The protocol concerning the exemption of nationals of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden from the obligation to have a passport or residence permit while resident in a Nordic country other than their own,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | website = United nations treaty collection | title = Protocol concerning the exemption of nationals of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden from the obligation to have a passport or residence permit while resident in a Scandinavian country other than their own | url = http://untreaty.un.org/unts/1_60000/5/32/00009566.pdf | accessdate = 2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; was signed on 22 May 1954 in [[Copenhagen]].

The protocol was implemented by individual but concurrent decisions by the governments of each of the countries, and can be revoked in case of war, danger of war, or other extraordinary international or national circumstances.

The protocol provides that citizens of the Nordic countries can travel without passport or other travel documentation to any other Nordic country. Citizens of the Nordic countries can reside without residence permit in any other Nordic country.

Police authorities in the Nordic countries shall make all necessary information available to ascertain a person's identity and citizenship in a Nordic country.

===Removal of passport checks at the internal Nordic borders===

The agreement between Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden to remove passport control at the internal Nordic borders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | website = United nations treaty collection | title = Agreement between Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden to remove passport control at the internal Nordic borders | url = http://untreaty.un.org/unts/1_60000/9/28/00017396.pdf | accessdate = 2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; was signed on 12 July 1957 in Copenhagen and came into force on 1 May 1958.

This agreement removed all passport checks at the internal Nordic borders, and required the Nordic countries to uphold passport control at the external borders. Aliens with residence permits are allowed to stay up to three months in other Nordic countries, except for seeking employment or conducting business.

Aliens who are denied entry into one Nordic country should also be denied entry into the other Nordic countries. The Nordic countries are also obliged to readmit aliens that should have been denied entry at the first point of entry.

==Temporary changes to border controls from 2015==

In November 2015, Sweden and Norway introduced temporary border controls, and requirements for all international airlines and ferries to check identity documents, due to the [[European migrant crisis]]. From 4 January 2016, Sweden requires bus and train carriers to perform identity checks on the Danish side of the [[Denmark–Sweden border]], while still keeping the border controls on the Swedish side (to check that the carriers perform the checks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35218921 |title=Migrant crisis: Sweden border checks come into force - BBC News |website=Bbc.com |date=2016-01-04 |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this a passport or a Nordic driver's license is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oresundsbron.com/sv/info/granskontroll |title=Øresundsbron |website=Oresundsbron.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[National identity cards in the European Economic Area|national id card]] from EU countries can be used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://polisen.se/Aktuellt/Tillfallig-granskontroll/ |title=Tillfällig gräns- och id-kontroll - Aktuellt |website=Polisen.se |date= |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but few Nordic citizens have them.

Recent internal border controls according to the information that have been provided to the [[European Commission]] affecting Nordic borders.&lt;ref name="temporary_controls"&gt;{{cite web |title=Temporary Reintroduction of Border Control |url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen/reintroduction-border-control/index_en.htm |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the Netherlands.

The [[Netherlands]] ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Netherlands.ogg|ˈ|n|ɛ|ð|ər|l|ən|d|z}}; {{lang-nl|Nederland}}, {{IPA-nl|ˈneːdərlɑnt|pron|Nl-Nederland.ogg}}) comprises the mainland located in [[Northwest Europe]] and several [[BES islands|islands]] located in the [[Caribbean]] that, together with [[Aruba]], [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], constitute the [[List of sovereign states|sovereign]] [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=July 2, 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nl.html|title=Netherlands|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlands is a [[parliamentary]] [[democracy|democratic]] [[constitutional monarchy]]. Its European mainland is bordered by the [[North Sea]] to the north and west, [[Belgium]] to the south, and [[Germany]] to the east.

The [[European Netherlands]] constitutes the vast majority (by land area and population) of both the country and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and as such 'the Netherlands' in common parlance often implicitly refers to this entity. Similarly, the articles linked to below predominately consider the European Netherlands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1987">'''Yekyua''' or "mother animal" is a class of [[Yakuts|Yakut]] spirits that remain hidden until the snow melts in the Spring. Each yekyua is associated with a particular animal, and they act as [[familiar spirit]]s to protect the Yakut [[shaman]].  They are dangerous and powerful.&lt;ref&gt;Magic, Witchcraft, and Religion
 By Arthur C. Lehmann, James E. Myers p.85 Mayfield Pub. Co., 1993 {{ISBN|1-55934-170-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most dangerous are attached to female shamans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dNKRmatAua8C&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=yekyua&amp;lr= Stutley (2002) p.55]&lt;/ref&gt;  The type of animal manifestation also determines the strength of the yekyua.  For example, dog yekyua have very little power, while elk yekyua are quite powerful.  Only shaman can see the yekyua.  When a shaman puts his spirit into that of his yekyua, he or she is dependent on his animal part, in as much as if another shaman who has manifested his animal kills that of another, the shaman with the dead animal will himself die.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2843791 Layard, J. W. (1930) "Shamanism: An analysis based on comparison with the flying tricksters of Marekula" ''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'' 60: pp. 525-550, p. 535] citing Czaplicka (1914) p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; When the yekyua are fighting in the spring, the shaman with which they are associated feel very ill.  The dog yekyua are not prized as they gnaw at the shaman and destroy his body, bringing him sickness.  Ordinarily, though, a good yekyua protects the shaman.&lt;ref&gt;Czaplicka (1914) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;
