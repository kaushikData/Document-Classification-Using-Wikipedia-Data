'''''Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology''''' ({{lang-fr|L'Être et le néant : Essai d'ontologie phénoménologique}}), sometimes published with the subtitle '''''A Phenomenological Essay on Ontology''''', is a 1943 book by the philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], in which the author asserts the individual's existence as prior to the individual's essence ("[[existence precedes essence]]") and seeks to demonstrate that [[free will]] exists.&lt;ref name=levy&gt;{{cite book|page=111|first=Neil|last=Levy|title=Sartre|publisher=One World Publications|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a prisoner of war in 1940 and 1941, Sartre read [[Martin Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927). Heidegger's work, an [[ontology|ontological]] investigation through the lens and method of Husserlian [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] ([[Edmund Husserl]] was Heidegger's teacher), initiated Sartre's own philosophical enquiry.

Though influenced by Heidegger, Sartre was profoundly sceptical of any measure by which humanity could achieve a kind of personal state of fulfilment comparable to the hypothetical Heideggerian re-encounter with Being. In Sartre's account, man is a creature haunted by a vision of "completion", what Sartre calls the ''[[ens causa sui]]'', literally "a being that causes itself", which many religions and philosophers identify as God. Born into the material reality of one's body, in a material universe, one finds oneself inserted into being. [[Consciousness]] has the ability to conceptualize possibilities, and to make them appear, or to annihilate them. Sartre offers a philosophical critique of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theories, based on the claim that consciousness is essentially self-conscious.

''Being and Nothingness'' is regarded as both the most important non-fiction expression of Sartre's [[existentialism]] and his most important philosophical work, original despite Sartre's debts to Heidegger. It is a noted contribution to the [[philosophy of sex]], and Sartre has been credited with original insights into [[sexual desire]]. However, the book has been criticized for Sartre's treatment of Freud, and it had come to be seen as outdated by the time of Sartre's death in 1980. The book was popular among British students in the 1960s, but it has been suggested that it usually went unread by them. Sartre's reflections on slime (''le visqueux'') have been described as celebrated.

== Background ==

=== Descartes ===
Sartre's existentialism shares its philosophical starting point with [[René Descartes]]: The first thing we can be aware of is our existence, even when doubting everything else ([[Cogito ergo sum]]). In ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]'', the main character's feeling of dizziness towards his own existence is induced by things, not thinking. This dizziness occurs "in the face of one's freedom and responsibility for giving a meaning to reality".&lt;ref&gt;Catalano, pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; As an important break with Descartes, Sartre rejects the ''primacy of knowledge'', as summed up in the phrase "[[Existence precedes essence]]", and offers a different conception of knowledge and consciousness.

=== Husserl ===
Important ideas in ''Being and Nothingness'' build on [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. To both philosophers, consciousness is intentional, meaning that there is only consciousness ''of'' something. For Sartre, intentionality implies that there is no form of self that is hidden inside consciousness (such as Husserl's ''transcendental ego''). An ego must be a structure outside consciousness, so that there can be consciousness ''of'' the ego.&lt;ref&gt;Catalano, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
In the introduction, Sartre sketches his own theory of consciousness, being, and phenomena through criticism of both earlier [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologists]] (most notably Husserl and Heidegger) as well as [[idealism|idealists]], [[rationalism|rationalists]], and [[empiricism|empiricists]]. According to him, one of the major achievements of modern philosophy is phenomenology because it disproved the kinds of [[epistemological dualism|dualism]] that set the existent up as having a "hidden" nature (such as [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[noumenon]]); Phenomenology has removed "the illusion of worlds behind the scene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Being and Nothingness|page=2|isbn=0-671-82433-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on an examination of the nature of phenomena, he describes the nature of two types of being, ''being-in-itself'' (the being of things) and ''being-for-itself''. While being-in-itself is something that can only be approximated by human being, being-for-itself is the being of consciousness.

===Part 1, Chapter 1: The origin of negation===
From Sartre's phenomenological point of view, nothingness is an experienced reality and cannot be a merely subjective mistake. The absence of a friend and absence of money hint at a ''being'' of nothingness. It is part of reality. In the first chapter, Sartre develops a theory of nothingness which is central to the whole book, especially to his account for bad faith and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Catalano, pp. 51-52&lt;/ref&gt; For him, nothingness is not just a mental concept that sums up negative judgements such as "Pierre is not here" and "I have no money". Though "it is evident that non-being always appears within the limits of a human expectation",&lt;ref&gt;''L'Être et le néant'', p. 41; Barnes, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; the concrete nothingness differs from mere abstract inexistence, such as the square circle. A concrete nothingness, e.g. not being able to see, is part of a totality: the life of the blind man in this world. This totality is modified by the nothingness which is part of it.&lt;ref&gt;Catalano, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

In the totality of consciousness and phenomenon (Heidegger's being-in-the-world), both can be considered separately, but exist only as a whole (intentionality of consciousness). The human attitude of inquiry, of asking questions, puts consciousness at distance from the world. Every question brings up the possibility of a negative answer, of non-being, e.g. "Who is entering? No one." For Sartre, this is how ''nothingness'' can exist at all. Non-being can neither be part of the being-in-itself nor can it be as a complement of it. Being-for-itself is the origin of negation. The relation between being-for-itself and being-in-itself is one of questioning the latter. By bringing nothingness into the world, consciousness does not annihilate the being of things, but changes its relation to it.

===Part 1, Chapter 2: Bad faith===
As [[Bad faith (existentialism)|Bad faith]], Sartre describes one's self-deception about the human reality. It can take two forms, the first one is making oneself falsely believe not to be what one actually is. The second one is conceiving oneself as an object (e.g. being identical to a job) and thereby denying freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, L'Être et le néant, p. 107-108&lt;/ref&gt; 

This essentially means that in being a waiter, grocer, etc., one must believe that their social role is equivalent to their human existence. Living a life defined by one's occupation, social, racial, or economic class, is the very essence of "bad faith", the condition in which people cannot transcend their [[Situation (Sartre)|situations]] in order to realize what they must be (human) and what they are not (waiter, grocer, etc.). It is also essential for an existent to understand that negation allows the self to enter what Sartre calls the "great human stream". The great human stream arises from a singular realization that nothingness is a state of mind in which we can become anything, in reference to our situation, that we desire.

The difference between existence and identity projection remains at the heart of human subjects who are swept up by their own condition, their "bad faith". An example of projection that Sartre uses is the café waiter who performs the duties, traditions, functions, and expectations of a café waiter:

{{quote|[W]hat ''are we'' then if we have the constant obligation to make ourselves what ''we are'' if our mode of being is having the obligation to be what we are? Let us consider this waiter in the café. His movement is quick and forward, a little too precise, a little too rapid. He bends forward a little too eagerly; his voice, his eyes express an interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer. Finally there he returns, trying to imitate in his walk the inflexible stiffness of some kind of automaton while carrying his tray with the recklessness of a tight-rope-walker by putting it in a perpetually unstable, perpetually broken equilibrium which he perpetually re-establishes by a light movement of the arm and hand. All his behavior seems to us a game. He applies himself to changing his movements as if they were mechanisms, the one regulating the other; his gestures and even his voice seems to be mechanisms; he gives himself the quickness and pitiless rapidity of things. He is playing, he is amusing himself. But what is he playing? We need not watch long before we can explain it: he is playing at ''being '' a waiter in a café. There is nothing there to surprise us.}}

Sartre also gives, as an example of bad faith, the attitude of the homosexual who denies that he is a homosexual, feeling that "a homosexual is not a homosexual" in the same sense that a table is a table or a red-haired man is red-haired. Sartre argues that such an attitude is partially correct since it is based in the "irreducible character of human reality", but that it would be fully correct only if the homosexual accepted that he is a homosexual in the sense that he has adopted a pattern of conduct defined as that of a homosexual, although not one "to the extent that human reality can not be finally defined by patterns of conduct".&lt;ref&gt;''Being and Nothingness''. Trans. Hazel E. Barnes. New York: Washington Square Press, 1984, pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre consistently mentions that in order to get out of bad faith, one must realize that one's existence and one's formal projection of a self are distinctly separate and within the means of human control. This separation is a form of ''nothingness''. Nothingness, in terms of bad faith, is characterized by Sartre as the internal negation which separates pure existence and identity, and thus we are subject to playing our lives out in a similar manner. An example is ''something that is what it is'' (existence) and ''something that is what it is not'' (a waiter defined by his occupation).

However, Sartre takes a stance against characterizing bad faith in terms of "mere social positions". Says Sartre, "I am never any one of my attitudes, any one of my actions." The good speaker is the one who ''plays'' at speaking because he cannot ''be speaking''. This literally means that, like the café waiter, the speaker is not his condition or social categorization, but is a speaker consumed by bad faith. Thus, we must realize what we are (beings who exist) and what we are not (a social/historical preoccupation) in order to step out of bad faith. Yet, existents (human beings) must maintain a balance between existence, their roles, and nothingness to become authentic beings.''

Additionally, an important tenet of bad faith is that we must enact a bit of "good faith" in order to take advantage of our role to reach an authentic existence. The authentic domain of bad faith is realizing that the role we are playing is the lie. To live and project into the future as a project of a self, while keeping out of bad faith and living by the will of the self is living life authentically.

One of the most important implications of bad faith is the abolition of traditional [[ethics]]. Being a "moral person" requires one to deny authentic impulses (everything that makes us human) and allow the will of another person to change one's actions. Being "a moral person" is one of the most severe forms of bad faith. Sartre essentially characterizes this as "the faith of bad faith" which is and should not be, in Sartre's opinion, at the heart of one's existence. Sartre has a very low opinion of conventional ethics, condemning it as a tool of the [[bourgeoisie]] to control the masses.

Bad faith also results when individuals begin to view their life as made up of distinct past events. By viewing one's ego as it once was rather than as it currently is, one ends up negating the current self and replacing it with a past self that no longer exists.

===Part 3, Chapter 1: The look===
The mere possible presence of another person causes one to [[gaze|look at oneself as an object]] and see one's world as it appears to the other. This is not done from a specific location outside oneself, but is non-positional. This is a recognition of the [[subjectivity]] in others.

This transformation is most clear when one sees a [[mannequin]] that one confuses for a real person for a moment.
*While they believe it is a person, their world is transformed. Objects now partly escape them; they have aspects that belong to the other person, and that are thus unknowable to them. During this time one can no longer have a total subjectivity. The world is now the other person's world, a foreign world that no longer comes from the self, but from the other. The other person is a "threat to the order and arrangement of your whole world...Your world is suddenly haunted by the Other's values, over which you have no control".&lt;ref name="earthlink"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.earthlink.net/~mazz747/id12.html|title=An analysis of "The look"| first= Paul Vincent|last= Spade|accessdate=July 2, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060615060533/http://home.earthlink.net/~mazz747/id12.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=June 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*When they realise it is a mannequin, and is not subjective, the world seems to transfer back, and they are again in the center of a universe. This is back to the pre-reflective mode of being, it is "the eye of the camera that is always present but is never seen".&lt;ref name=earthlink/&gt; The person is occupied and too busy for self-reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbae.nmsu.edu/~dboje/teaching/503/sartre_links.htm|title=Jean-Paul Sartre – Being and Nothingness|accessdate=July 2, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708133710/http://cbae.nmsu.edu/~dboje/teaching/503/sartre_links.htm|archivedate=July 8, 2006|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is continual, unavoidable, and ineluctable.&lt;ref name=earthlink/&gt;

====Being for Others====
Sartre states that many relationships are created by people's attraction not to another person, but rather how that person makes them feel about themselves by how they look at them. This is a state of emotional alienation whereby a person avoids experiencing their subjectivity by identifying themselves with "the look" of the other. The consequence is conflict. In order to maintain the person's own being, the person must control the other, but must also control the freedom of the other "as freedom". These relationships are a profound manifestation of "bad faith" as the for-itself is replaced with the other's freedom. The purpose of either participant is not to exist, but to maintain the other participant's looking at them. This system is often mistakenly called "love", but it is, in fact, nothing more than emotional alienation and denial of freedom through conflict with the other. Sartre believes that it is often created as a means of making the unbearable anguish of a person's relationship to their "[[facticity]]" (all of the concrete details against the background of which human freedom exists and is limited, such as birthplace and time) bearable. At its extreme, the alienation can become so intense that due to the guilt of being so radically enslaved by "the look" and therefore radically missing their own freedoms, the participants can experience [[Sadomasochism|masochistic and sadistic]] attitudes. This happens when the participants cause pain to each other, in attempting to prove their control over the other's look, which they cannot escape because they believe themselves to be so enslaved to the look that experiencing their own subjectivity would be equally unbearable.

====Sex====
Sartre explains that "the look" is the basis for [[sexual desire]], declaring that a biological motivation for [[sex]] does not exist. Instead, "double reciprocal incarnation" is a form of mutual awareness which Sartre takes to be at the heart of the sexual experience. This involves the mutual recognition of subjectivity of some sort, as Sartre describes: "I make myself flesh in order to impel the Other to realize for herself and for me her own flesh. My caress causes my flesh to be born for me insofar as it is for the Other flesh causing her to be born as flesh."

Even in sex (perhaps especially in sex), men and women are haunted by a state in which consciousness and bodily being would be in perfect harmony, with desire satisfied. Such a state, however, can never be. We try to bring the beloved's consciousness to the surface of their body by use of magical acts performed, gestures (kisses, desires, etc.), but at the moment of [[orgasm]] the illusion is ended and we return to ourselves, just as it is ended when the skier comes to the foot of the mountain or when the commodity that once we desired loses its glow upon our purchase of it. There will be, for Sartre, no such moment of completion because "man is a useless passion" to be the ''[[ens causa sui]]'', the God of the [[ontological proof]].

====Nothingness====
Sartre contends that human existence is a conundrum whereby each of us exists, for as long as we live, within an overall condition of nothingness (''no thing-ness'')—that ultimately allows for free consciousness. Yet simultaneously, within our ''being'' (in the physical world), we are constrained to make continuous, conscious choices.

It is this dichotomy that causes anguish, because choice (subjectivity) represents a limit on freedom within an otherwise unbridled range of thoughts. Subsequently, humans seek to flee our anguish through action-oriented constructs such as escapes, visualizations, or visions (such as dreams) designed to lead us toward some meaningful end, such as necessity, destiny, determinism (God), etc. Thus, in living our lives, we often become unconscious ''actors''—Bourgeois, Feminist, Worker, Party Member, Frenchman, Canadian or American—each doing as we must to fulfill our chosen characters' destinies.

However, Sartre contends our conscious choices (leading to often unconscious actions) run counter to our intellectual freedom. Yet we are bound to the conditioned and physical world—in which some form of action is always required. This leads to ''failed dreams of completion'', as Sartre described them, because inevitably we are unable to bridge the void between the purity and spontaneity of thought and all-too constraining action; between the ''being'' and the ''nothingness'' that inherently coincide in our ''self''.

Sartre's recipe for ''fulfillment'' is to escape all quests by ''completing'' them. This is accomplished by rigorously forcing order onto nothingness, employing the "spirit (or consciousness of mind) of seriousness" and describing the failure to do so in terms such as "[[Sartre and bad faith|bad faith]]" and "[[false consciousness]]". Though Sartre's conclusion seems to be that being diminishes before nothingness since consciousness is probably based more on spontaneity than on stable seriousness, he contends that any person of a serious nature is ''obliged'' to continuous struggle between:

a) the conscious desire for peaceful self-fulfillment through physical actions and social roles—as if living within a portrait that one actively paints of oneself.

and

b) the more pure and raging spontaneity of ''no thing'' consciousness, of being instantaneously free to overturn one's roles, pull up stakes, and strike out on new paths.

====Phenomenological ontology====
In Sartre's opinion, [[consciousness]] does not make sense by itself: it arises only as an awareness of objects. Consciousness is therefore always and essentially consciousness ''of something'', whether this "something" is a thing, a person, an imaginary object, etc. Phenomenologists often refer to this quality of consciousness as "[[intentionality]]". Sartre's contribution, then, is that in addition to always being consciousness ''of something'', consciousness is always consciousness ''of itself''. In other words, all consciousness is, by definition, ''self-consciousness''. By "self-consciousness", Sartre does not mean being aware of oneself thought of as an object (e.g., one's "ego"), but rather that, as a phenomenon in the world, consciousness both appears and appears ''to itself'' at the same time. By appearing to itself, Sartre argues that consciousness is fully transparent; unlike an ordinary "object" (a house, for instance, of which it is impossible to perceive all of the sides at the same time), consciousness "sees" all aspects of itself at once. This non-positional quality of consciousness is what makes it a unique type of being, a being that exists ''for itself''.

===Critique of Freud===
Sartre offers a critique of the psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]], based on the claim that consciousness is essentially self-conscious. Sartre also argues that Freud's theory of repression is internally flawed.&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt; According to Sartre, in his clinical work, Freud encountered patients who seemed to embody a particular kind of paradox—they appeared to both ''know'' and ''not know'' the same thing. In response, Freud postulated the existence of the unconscious, which contains the "truth" of the traumas underlying the patients' behavior. This "truth" is actively repressed, which is made evident by the patients' resistance to its revelation during analysis. Yet what does the resisting if the patients are unaware of what they are repressing? Sartre finds the answer in what Freud calls the "censor". "The only level on which we can locate the refusal of the subject", Sartre writes, "is that of the censor." Further:

{{quote|[T]he resistance of the patient implies on the level of the censor an awareness of the thing repressed as such, a comprehension of the end toward which the questions of the psychoanalyst are leading . . . These various operations in their turn imply that the censor is conscious (of) itself. But what type of self-consciousness can the censor have? It must be the consciousness (of) being conscious of the drive to be repressed, but precisely ''in order not to be conscious of it''. What does this mean if not that the censor is in bad faith?&lt;ref&gt;''Being and Nothingness''. Trans. Hazel E. Barnes. New York: Washington Square Press, 1984, pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, Sartre views Freud's unconscious to be a scapegoat for the paradox of simultaneously knowing and not knowing the same information. Instead of alleviating the paradox, Freud simply moves it to the censor, establishing "between the unconscious and consciousness an autonomous consciousness in bad faith".&lt;ref&gt;''Being and Nothingness''. Trans. Barnes, 1984, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre thinks that the postulation of a censor within the psychic economy is therefore redundant: at the level of the censor, we still encounter the same problem of a consciousness that hides something from itself. For Sartre, what Freud identifies as repression is rather indicative of the larger structure of bad faith. [[Psychoanalysis]] thus does not yield any special insight, since hiding something from oneself occurs at the level of consciousness as a unified phenomenon, not as part of some intra-psychic mechanism.

Toward the end of ''Being and Nothingness'', Sartre attempts to adapt some of Freud's ideas, and thereby develop an "existential psychoanalysis" in which causal categories are replaced by teleological categories.&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;

==Special terminology used by Sartre==&lt;!-- "Sartrean terminology" redirects here --&gt;
Explanation of terms based on appendix to the English edition of ''Being and Nothingness'' by translator [[Hazel Barnes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sartre|first=Jean-Paul |others=Hazel E. Barnes (trans.) |title=Being and Nothingness|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|location=London|pages=649–656|isbn=0-415-27848-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Being (être): Including both Being-in-itself and Being-for-itself (both as defined below), but the latter is the nihilation of the former. Being is objective, not subjective or individual.
*[[Being in itself#Being-in-itself for Sartre|Being-in-itself]] (''être-en-soi''): Non-conscious Being. The sort of phenomenon that is greater than the knowledge that we have of it.
*Being-for-itself (''être-pour-soi''): The nihilation of Being-in-itself; consciousness conceived as a lack of Being, a desire for Being, a relation of Being. The For-itself brings Nothingness into the world and therefore can stand out from Being and form attitudes towards other beings by seeing what it is not.
*Being-for-others (''être-pour-autrui''): Here a new dimension arises in which the self exists as an object for others. Each For-itself seeks to recover its own Being by making an object out of the other.
*Consciousness: The transcending For-itself. Sartre states that "Consciousness is a being such that in its being, its being is in question insofar as this being implies a being other than itself."
*[[Existence]]: Concrete, individual being-for-itself here and now.
*[[Existence precedes essence]]. The subjective existence of reality precedes and defines its nature. Who you are (your essence) is defined by what you do (your existence).
*[[Facticity]] (''facticité''): Broadly: facts about the world. More precisely, the For-itself's necessary connection with the In-itself, with the world and its own past.
*Freedom: The very being of the For-itself which is "condemned to be free". It must forever choose for itself and therefore make itself.
*Nothingness (''néant''): Although not having being, it is supported by being. It comes into the world by the For-itself.
*Reflection (''reflet''): The form in which the For-itself founds its own nothingness through the dyad of "the-reflection-reflecting"
*Reflection (''réflexion''):The consciousness attempting to become its own object.

==Reception==
''Being and Nothingness'' is considered Sartre's most important philosophical work,&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt; and the most important non-fiction expression of his [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roth, John K. |editor=McGreal, Ian P. |title=Great Thinkers of the Western World |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |year=1992 |page=542 |isbn=0-06-270026-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian existentialist [[Gabriel Marcel]] wrote that it was of "incontestable" importance and ranked among the most important contributions made to general philosophy. While Marcel noted the influence of [[Martin Heidegger]] on "the form at least" of Sartre's work, he also observed that Sartre diverged from the views expressed by Heidegger in ''Being and Time'' (1927) in important ways, and that Sartre's contributions were original. Marcel considered Sartre's analysis of bad faith "one of the most outstanding and solid" parts of ''Being and Nothingness'', writing that it prevented Sartre's arguments from being purely abstract. Marcel saw one of the most important merits of the work to be to show "that a form of metaphysics which denies or refuses grace inevitably ends by setting up in front of us the image of an atrophied and contradictory world where the better part of ourselves is finally unable to recognise itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marcel|first=Gabriel|title=''Homo Viator: Introduction to a Metaphysic of Hope''|publisher=[[Victor Gollancz Ltd]]|year=1951|pages=166–167, 183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Jean Wahl]] criticized Sartre's arguments about the topic of "nothing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grene, Marjorie |title=Introduction to Existentialism |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1959 |page=52 |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Frederick Copleston]], writing in ''[[A History of Philosophy (Copleston)|A History of Philosophy]]'' (1946–1986), described Sartre's view that all human actions are the result of free choice as "highly implausible", though he noted that Sartre had ways of defending his position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Copleston, Frederick |title=A History of Philosophy Volume IX.

Ayer]] said that, apart from some psychological insights, the book was "a pretentious metaphysical thesis" and "principally an exercise in misusing the verb 'to be'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=174-175|title=Paris After the Liberation: 1944 - 1949|last2=Cooper|first2=Artemis|isbn=9780141032412|last1=Beevor|first1=Antony|publisher=Penguin|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[William Barrett (philosopher)|William Barrett]], writing in ''[[Irrational Man]]'' (1958), described ''Being and Nothingness'' as "a great, uneven, brilliant and verbose tome". He noted Sartre's debts to Heidegger, but nevertheless credited him with originality. He criticized Sartre for neglecting Heidegger's "notion of the truth of Being", his understanding of what it means for a subject or object to be. In his view, Sartre failed to "deal with the problem of truth in a radical and existential way", instead viewing truth in "the ordinary intellectualistic sense that has been traditional with non-existential philosophers" and thereby remaining a Cartesian rationalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrett|first=William|title=Irrational Man: A Study in Existential Philosophy|publisher=[[Greenwood Press]]|year=1977|pages=219, 222}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Sontag]], writing in an essay in ''The Supplement'' to the ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator|Columbia Spectator]]'' that was later published in ''[[Against Interpretation]]'' (1966), praised Sartre's discussions of the body and concrete relations with others, identifying them as part of a French tradition of serious thought about problems of fundamental importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sontag, Susan |title=Against Interpretation and Other Essays |publisher=Anchor Books |location=New York |year=1990 |pages=ix, 256–257 |isbn=0-385-26708-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; John B. Vickery wrote that Sartre's work resembles Sir [[James George Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890) in the way its author "merges psychology and the concrete sense of fiction", although he considered it less readable than Frazer's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vickery, John B. |editor=Slote, Bernice |title=Myth and Symbol: Critical Approaches and Applications |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln |year=1967 |page=175 |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Iris Murdoch]], writing that [[continental philosophy]] shares the same general orientation as English [[analytic philosophy]], compared Sartre's work to the British philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murdoch|first=Iris|title=''Sartre: Romantic Rationalist''|publisher=[[Fontana Books]]|year=1968|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the philosopher [[Steven Crowell]], ''Being and Nothingness'' had come to be seen as outdated by the time of Sartre's death in 1980, since, with its emphasis on consciousness, it seemed "tied to the subjectivism and psychologism that structuralism and analytic philosophy had finally laid to rest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Crowell, Steven |editor=Crowell, Steven |title=The Cambridge Companion to Existentialism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2012 |page=199 |isbn=978-0-521-73278-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[David Pears]], writing in the anthology ''[[Philosophical essays on Freud]]'' (1982), criticized Sartre's critique of Freud, describing it as complex but imprecisely formulated and open to potential objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pears, David |editor1=Wollheim, Richard |editor2=Hopkins, James |title=Philosophical essays on Freud |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1982 |pages=273–276 |isbn=978-0521284257 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray S. Davis, writing in ''Smut: Erotic Reality/Obscene Ideology'' (1983), credited Sartre with being the first author to present a phenomenological analysis of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Davis, Murray S. |title=Smut: Erotic Reality/Obscene Ideology |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1985 |page=2 |isbn=0-226-13792-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Roger Scruton]], writing in ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986), credited Sartre with "perhaps the most acute philosophical analysis" of sexual desire, and endorsed Sartre's view that sexual desire cannot be considered equivalent to appetite, as this ignores "the interpersonal component of human sexual responses." He described Sartre's reflections on ''le visqueux'' as "celebrated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Scruton, Roger |title=Sexual Desire: A Philosophical Investigation |publisher=Phoenix |location=London |year=1994 |pages=23, 32, 74 |isbn=1-85799-100-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also described Sartre's book as a great work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Scruton, Roger |title=Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |year=2016 |page=181 |isbn=978-1-4729-3595-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one that offers a "stunning apology for sado-masochism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Scruton, Roger |author2=Dooley, Mark |title=Conversations with Roger Scruton |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |year=2016 |page=103 |isbn=978-1-4729-1709-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled that in 1960 its English translation became the first book he bought, and that he and his friends at school "all claimed intimate knowledge of this book that few of us had read and none of us had understood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claremont.org/crb/article/song-of-myself/|title=Song of Myself|author=|date=|website=claremont.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211150054/http://www.claremont.org/crb/article/song-of-myself/|archivedate=11 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physician [[Frank Gonzalez-Crussi]], writing in ''On the Nature of Things Erotic'' (1988), credited Sartre with being "the first to realize that by an error of perspective the average man deludes himself into thinking that sexual desire is the same as desire of coition", endorsing Sartre's view that "Desire in no way implies by itself the sexual act".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gonzalez-Crussi, Frank |title=On the Nature of Things Erotic |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |year=1989 |page=13 |isbn=0-679-72199-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Camille Paglia]], writing in ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (1990), equated Sartre's term for slime, ''le visqueux'', with "Dionysus' swamp, the fleshy muck of the generative matrix."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sexual Personae |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New York |year=1990 |page=93 |isbn=0-300-04396-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Thomas Baldwin (philosopher)|Thomas Baldwin]], writing in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'' (1995), described ''Being and Nothingness'' as a work of pessimism. He wrote that Sartre's argument that Freud's theory of repression is internally flawed is based on a misunderstanding of Freud, and that Sartre's attempts to adapt Freud's ideas are of greater interest.&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;{{cite book |author=Baldwin, Thomas |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |pages=835–7 |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director [[Richard Eyre]] recalled that ''Being and Nothingness'' was popular among British students in the 1960s, but suggests that among them the work usually went unread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Eyre, Richard |author2=Sartre, Jean-Paul |title=Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2003 |page=viii |isbn=0-415-27848-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{buddhism}}
'''Buddhist hermeneutics''' refers to the interpretative frameworks historical Buddhists have used to interpret and understand [[Buddhist texts]] and to the interpretative instructions that Buddhists texts themselves impart upon the reader. Because of the broad variety of scriptures, [[Schools of Buddhism|Buddhist traditions and schools]], there are also a wide variety of different [[hermeneutic]] approaches within Buddhism. 

Buddhist scriptural [[exegesis]] has always been driven by the [[Soteriology|soteriological]] needs of the tradition to find the true meaning (''artha'') of Buddhist scriptures. Another important issue in Buddhist hermeneutics is the problem of which [[sutra]]s are to be taken to be '[[Buddhavacana]]', "the word of the Buddha" and also which sutras contain the correct teachings.

The Early Buddhist texts such as the [[Sutta Pitaka]] and the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agamas]] distinguish between Buddhist suttas that contain clear meaning (Pāli:Nītattha; Sanskrit: nītārtha) and those that require further interpretation (Pāli: neyyattha; Sanskrit: neyartha). This later developed into the [[two truths doctrine]], which states there is a conventional truth and an ultimate truth. The Buddhist concept of [[Upaya]] (skillful means) is another common theme in Buddhist Hermeneutics, and holds that the Buddha sometimes taught things that were not literally true as a skillful teaching strategy, and also taught many different things to different people, depending on their ability to understand.&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;Lopez, Donald S. ''Buddhist Hermeneutics'', 1993, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Buddhist texts==
[[File:Tipitaka scripture.jpg|thumb|In pre-modern times Buddhist scripture was written on thin slices of wood ([[Palm-leaf manuscript]] or Bamboo). The leaves were kept on top of each other by thin sticks and the scripture is covered in cloth and kept in a box.]]
The issue of how to determine if a teaching is a genuine teaching of the Buddha is present in the earliest Buddhist scriptures. One such text is the [[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]], which has a section called 'The Four Great References' (''mahāpadesa'') that outlines a set of criteria for determining whether a teaching is from the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Digha Nikaya 16 PTS: D ii 72 chapters 1-6, Maha-parinibbana Sutta: Last Days of the Buddha translated from the Pali by Sister Vajira &amp; Francis Story&lt;/ref&gt; This sutta states that four references are acceptable:

#The words of the Buddha himself, taught in person.
#A community of Buddhist elders and their leader. 
#Several elder monks, who "are learned, who have accomplished their course, who are preservers of the Dhamma, the Discipline, and the Summaries."
#A single monk, who "is learned, who has accomplished his course, who is a preserver of the Dhamma, the Discipline, and the Summaries."

In the cases where someone is not being directly taught by the Buddha however, the text goes on to say that the hearer should check these teachings by "carefully studying the sentences word by word, one should trace them in the Discourses and verify them by the Discipline." If they are not traceable to the suttas, one should reject them.

An important distinction the Early Buddhist texts outline is the distinction between statements that are ''Neyyatha'' ('needing to be drawn out/explained') and ''Nītattha'' ('fully drawn out'). The Neyyatha sutta states:

"Monks, these two slander the Tathagata. Which two? He who explains a discourse whose meaning needs to be inferred as one whose meaning has already been fully drawn out. And he who explains a discourse whose meaning has already been fully drawn out as one whose meaning needs to be inferred. These are two who slander the Tathagata."&lt;ref&gt;"Neyyatha Sutta: A Meaning to be Inferred" (AN 2.25), translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu. Access to Insight (Legacy Edition), 4 August 2010, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an02/an02.025.than.html&lt;/ref&gt;

This notion was later elaborated in the [[Theravada]] [[Abhidhamma]] and [[Mahayana]] literature as conventional or relative truth (sammuti- or vohaara-sacca) and ultimate truth (paramattha-sacca), and became known as the [[two truths doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;KARUNADASA, Y. THERAVADA VERSION OF THE TWO TRUTHS, {{cite web |url=http://skb.or.kr/down/papers/094.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224193443/http://www.skb.or.kr/down/papers/094.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another criteria the Buddha taught to differentiate Dhamma from what was not his teaching, was that of analyzing how a particular teaching affects one's thinking. The Gotami sutta states that anything that leads to dispassion, liberation, relinquishment, having few wishes, contentment, seclusion, arousing of energy and being easy to support are said to be the teacher's instruction, while anything that leads to the opposite of these qualities cannot be the true teaching of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;AN 8.53 PTS: A iv 280, Gotami Sutta: To Gotami, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an08/an08.053.than.html&lt;/ref&gt; Hence in the Early Buddhist texts, the work of hermeneutics is deeply tied with the spiritual practice and a mindful awareness of the effect our practices have on our state of mind.

==Theravada==
In the [[Theravada]] tradition, all of the [[Tipitaka]] is held to be "the word of the Buddha" ([[Buddhavacana]]).&lt;ref name=Katz&gt; Nathan Katz, Review of ''The Word of the Buddha: the Tipitaka and its Interpretation in Theravada Buddhism, by George D. Bond.'' THE JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BUDDHIST STUDIES; https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8628/2535&lt;/ref&gt; However, for something to be Buddhavacana according to Theravada does not necessarily mean that it was spoken by the historical Buddha. Texts and teachings not spoken by the Buddha directly but taught by his disciples, such as the [[Theragatha]], are said to be 'well said' (''subhasitam'') and an expression of the [[Dhamma]] and therefore to be [[Buddhavacana]].&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  

The interpretation of the Buddha's words is central to the Theravada tradition. Because of this, many Theravada doctrines were developed in the commentaries ([[Atthakatha]]) and [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|sub-commentaries]] to the Tipitaka, which are central interpretative texts. By far the most important Theravada commentator was the fifth century scholar monk [[Buddhagosa]] who wrote commentaries on large portions of the [[Pali canon]].

Two major [[Theravada]] hermeneutical texts are the [[Petakopadesa]] and the [[Nettipakarana]] (c. 1st century CE), both traditionally attributed to the exegete [[Katyayana (Buddhist)|Mahākaccāna]]. Both texts use the [[Gradual training|gradual path]] to [[Nirvana]] as a hermeneutical tool for explaining the teachings of the Buddha in way that was relevant to both monastics and laypersons.&lt;ref name=Bond&gt;George, Bond. The Gradual Path as a Hermeneutical Approach to the Dhamma (in ''Lopez, Buddhist Hermeneutics'')&lt;/ref&gt; These texts assume that the structure of the [[Dhamma]] is derived from the gradual path. They classify different types of persons (ordinary persons, initiates and the adepts) and personality types and different types of suttas that the Buddha addressed to each type of person (suttas on [[Buddhist ethics|morality]], on penetrating wisdom, on [[Bhavana]]).&lt;ref name=Bond&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Each type of sutta is meant to lead each type of person further on the graduated path to Nirvana. 

The Netti provides five guidelines (''naya'') and sixteen modes (''hara'') for clarifying the relationship between a text's linguistic convention (''byanjana'') and its true meaning (''atha'').

==Dharmakirti==
According to Alexander Berzin, the Indian Buddhist philosopher [[Dharmakirti]] in ''A Commentary on [Dignaga's "Compendium of] Validly Cognizing Minds'' proposed two decisive criteria for authenticity of a Buddhist text:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Buddha taught an enormous variety of subjects, but only those themes that repeatedly appear throughout his teachings indicate what Buddha actually intended. These themes include taking safe direction (refuge), understanding the laws of behavioral cause and effect, developing higher ethical discipline, concentration, and discriminating awareness of how things actually exist, and generating love and compassion for all. A text is an authentic Buddhist teaching if it accords with these major themes. The second criterion for authenticity is that correct implementation of its instructions by qualified practitioners must bring about the same results as Buddha repeatedly indicated elsewhere. Proper practice must lead to achieving the ultimate goals of liberation or enlightenment and the provisional goals of spiritual attainment along the way.&lt;ref&gt;Berzin, Alexander, The Autheticity of the Tantras, https://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/vajrayana/tantra-theory/making-sense-of-tantra/the-autheticity-of-the-tantras&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mahayana hermeneutics==
[[Mahayana Buddhism]] has an immense number of texts, many of which were written and codified hundreds of years after the Buddha's death. In spite of this historical fact, they are still considered [[Buddhavacana]]. The vast canon of Mahayana texts is organized into groupings of teachings or "[[Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma|turnings of the wheel of Dharma]]." The [[Sandhinirmocana Sutra]] for example, sees itself as inaugurating the third turning ([[Yogacara]]), which is the highest and most definitive teaching. Likewise, the [[Lotus sutra]] presents itself as being the ultimate and final teaching of the Buddha. Because of these mutually contradictory texts, Buddhist scholars had to find a way to harmonize the many different sutras and teachings into a coherent canon and interpretative framework, sometimes by outlining a classification system for them (Chinese:''p'an-chiao''). For example, in China, the [[Huayan school]] placed the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]] as the highest sutra, while the [[Tiantai]] school promotes the Lotus sutra at the top of their sutra hierarchy. 

The Mahayana schools saw the 'lower' ([[Sravakayana]]) teachings as skillful means ([[Upaya]]) of guiding the less capable towards the higher teachings of the Mahayana sutras - even while disagreeing on which sutra represented the definitive meaning of the Buddha's enlightened message. The Buddha was said to have adapted his message based on his audience, expounding different teachings to different people, all depending on how intelligent and spiritually advanced they were. The Mahayana schools' classification systems were meant to organize sutras based on this hierarchical typology of persons (Sravakas, Mahayanists, etc). Buddhist schools' hierarchical classification systems were often used as tools in their doctrinal debates. As [[Etienne Lamotte]] writes: “Each school tends to take literally the doctrinal texts which conform to its theses and to consider those which cause dilemmas as being of provisional meaning.”&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

These doctrinal texts are those each school identifies as answering the core question of Mahayana hermeneutics: "What was the content of the Buddha's enlightenment?"&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this focus, understanding a text's authorial intent is crucial for the spiritual development of the Buddhist practitioner. Buddhist hermeneutics is therefore an attempt to extract the Buddha's instructions and wisdom for spiritual [[praxis (process)|praxis]] from a particular text. Because the goal of Buddhism is to become enlightened, according to Lamotte, the main validation of one's hermeneutical method is one's experience in [[meditation]], and ultimately the experience of [[nirvana]].

An important Mahayana sutra, the ''Catuhpratisarana sutra'', sets forth a set of rules for Buddhist exegesis. This sutra outlines the ''four reliances'':&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

#Rely on the [[Dharma]], not on the teacher
#Rely on the meaning, not the letter
#Rely on the definitive meaning (nitartha), not on the provisional one (neyartha)
#Rely on wisdom ([[jnana]]), not on your ordinary mind ([[vijnana]])

Another set of hermeneutical concepts used by Mahayana Buddhists are the four special intentions (abhipraya) and the four hidden intentions (abhisamdhi).

The '''Carte Manuscripts''' are archived historical papers collected by [[Thomas Carte]] (1686–1754). They are held in the [[Bodleian Library]], at the [[University of Oxford]], [[England]].

Among Carte's collection were many documents relating to the [[history of Ireland]]. Thomas Carte gave a first [[tranche]] of Irish papers to the Bodleian in 1753.

Carte's papers were arranged for binding in 276 volumes in 1862, and in 1871 [[Charles William Russell]] and [[John Patrick Prendergast]] edited the eight-volume ''Report on the Carte Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library''.

A catalogue of the [http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/1500-1900/carte-sc/carte_sc.html Carte Papers] is available via the Online Catalogues of  [http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/online.htm Western Manuscripts] at the Bodleian Library. A handwritten calendar of the Carte Papers, produced between 1878 and 1883, is available in the Library. The 1660-1687 section of the [http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/projects/carte/carte.html Carte Calendar] is published online.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus''}}

'''''Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus''''' is a 2009 [[theology|theological]] book by the [[Australia]]n [[Jesuit]] [[priest]] and academic [[Gerald O'Collins]]. This work was originally published in 1995 with the title ''Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus Christ'', but the author thoroughly revised the whole text in 2009 to take account of the numerous biblical, historical, and systematic studies of [[Jesus]] that appeared following its first edition.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Preface to the Second Edition'', p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In this revised and updated second edition of his account of [[Systematic theology|systematic]] [[Christology]], O'Collins critically examines the more authoritative biblical and historical scholarship before confronting some key questions about orthodox faith and [[free will]] as applicable to Jesus in his person, being, and activity.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Preface'' to 1st and 2nd editions, pp.vii-xii.&lt;/ref&gt; In seeking to clarify the essential truths about him, the book investigates who Jesus was/is and what he did/does.

O'Collins attempts to answer some difficult questions: Was Jesus both human and divine? If so, how is that possible and not a blatant contradiction in terms? ''"Surely - he writes - we cannot attribute to one and the same subject the attributes of being simultaneously finite (as a human being) and infinite (as Son of God)?"''&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The author proposes that one should envisage Jesus' revealing and redeeming 'work' as having an impact not only on all men and women of all times and places, but also on the whole created [[cosmos]]. Recognising the difficulty in describing or even minimally explaining Christ's salvific 'work', the book is built around the [[resurrection]] of the crucified Jesus, highlights love as the key to [[redemption (theology)|redemption]], and proposes a synthesis of the divine presence through Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ch. 1, pp. 1-11 and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second edition includes fresh material on current discussions in the study of Christology: the use of '[[near-death experience|near-death]]' and bereavement experiences as analogies to the post-resurrection appearances of [[Christ]]; contemporary [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[theology]] and the case for the theological coherence of the [[Incarnation]]; the universal redemptive activity of Christ; and the place and possibilities of 'presence' as an organising category in Christology.

Furthermore, the author covers specific theological approaches including [[Martin Luther]]'s theology of the cross and [[liberation theology]].

==Life and career==

De Paulo received a Ph.D. in philosophy in 1995 from the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|location=Rome|publisher=Pontifical Gregorian University|last=Paulo|first=Craig J. N. de|type=Ph.D.|title=Being and conversion: a phenomenological ontology of radical restlessness|year=1995|oclc=493600967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Paulo was ordained as a deacon and priest in the United States in the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]], an [[Eastern Catholic]] church within the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. In 2007, he was installed as pastor in [[East McKeesport, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|location=Carnegie, PA|publisher=Holy Trinity Ukrainian Catholic Church|website=htucc.org|title=From the 2007 family album|year=|url=http://www.htucc.org/parish_album.htm|accessdate=2014-06-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102125843/http://www.htucc.org/parish_album.htm|archivedate=2007-11-02|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving the Roman Catholic Church, he became a bishop of the Old Catholic Confederation&amp;nbsp;– formed in 2013&amp;nbsp;– and became its primate and Archbishop of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.occus.org/primate-and-archbishop, title= Primate of the Old Catholic Confederation and Archbishop of the United States&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2031">The '''doctrine of repair and reconstruction''' in [[United States patent law]] distinguishes between permissible repair of a [[patent]]ed article, which the right of an owner of property to preserve its utility and operability guarantees, and impermissible reconstruction of a patented article, which is [[patent infringement]]. The doctrine is explained in ''[[Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;365 U.S. 336 (1961); see also Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U.S. 476 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Aro'' case states the rule in these terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The decisions of this Court require the conclusion that reconstruction of a patented entity, {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} unpatented elements, is limited to such a true reconstruction of the entity as to "in fact make a new article," after the entity, viewed as a whole, has become spent. In order to call the monopoly, conferred by the patent grant, into play for a second time, it must, indeed, be a second creation of the patented entity. …Mere replacement of individual unpatented parts, one at a time, whether of the same part repeatedly or different parts successively, is no more than the lawful right of the owner to repair his property.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An extension  of the doctrine is a right to modify the product to enhance its functionality, such as to make it operate faster or with a different size of product. The Supreme Court said in ''[[Wilbur-Ellis Co. v. Kuther]]''&lt;ref&gt;377 U.S. 422 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; that such a right was "kin  to repair for it bore on the useful capacity of the old combination, on which the royalty had been paid."

The House of Lords declared a similar principle—the [[doctrine of non-derogation from grants]]—concerning car owners' repair and replacement of automobile parts, in ''[[British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co.]]''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3882">'''Ethical monotheism''' is a form of exclusive [[monotheism]] in which [[God]] is the source for one standard of [[morality]], who guides humanity through [[ethics|ethical principles]].&lt;ref name=EncyclopediaBritannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethical monotheism|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1770434/ethical-monotheism|website=britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prager|first1=Dennis|title=Ethical Monotheism|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/mono.html|website=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|publisher=American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Ethical monotheism originated within non-missionizing [[Judaism]] to the exclusion of other gods or higher powers in the biblical period.&lt;ref name=IJS&gt;{{cite web|title=CORE ETHICAL TEACHINGS OF JUDAISM|url=http://www.ijs.org.au/The-Ethical-Teachings-of-Judaism/default.aspx|website=ijs.org.au|publisher=Ian Lacey and Josie Lacey|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} It is evident in many different religions, such as Zoroastrianism, Christianity, Islam, Bahá'í Faith, Sikhism, and many more; all of these religions carry the belief of having one sole higher power, who controls everything that occurs in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Nikiprowetzky, V. (1975). Ethical monotheism. (2 ed., Vol. 104, pp. 69-89). New York: The MIT Press Article Stable. {{jstor|20024331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally, ethical monotheism implied the adherence to the non-physical, non-[[Matter|corporeal]], [[eternity|eternal]], and in no way [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] "[[God in Judaism|God of Abraham]], God of Isaac, and God of Jacob" (''[[Amidah#Structure of the weekday Amidah|Elohei Avraham, Elohei Yitzchak ve Elohei Ya`aqov]]'').{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} This original form of ethical monotheism is based on practice, tradition and—to some—the logical result of questions concerning the origin of the world, rather than arrived at as the conclusion of a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] argument. The worship of other gods that were not present at the [[Mattan Torah|revelation on Mount Sinai]], in particular the [[God in Christianity#The Son|God in Christianity]], is referred to as ''[[Avodah Zarah|avodah zarah]]'' in Judaism, and it is traditionally believed that there are neither other pagan gods nor other ([[Incarnation|incarnated]]) divine personages.

The God of ethical monotheism is worshiped in [[Islamization|Islam]] and in [[Bahá'í Faith]], but can also be the [[Zoroastrian]] higher divine uncreated spirit named [[Ahura Mazda]], and in [[Sikhism]] the [[Supreme Being]] or the creator of all named [[Waheguru]]. In [[Christianity]] the original God of ethical monotheism is worshiped as part of the [[Trinity]], or as part of [[non-trinitarian]] conceptions of God.&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weber Bederman|first1=Diane|title=The True Meaning of Ethical Monotheism|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/diane-bederman/what-is-ethical-monotheis_b_4993438.html|accessdate=26 December 2014|issue=Chaplain:Religion is an affair of the mind and heart.|publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.|date=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other gods are variously considered to be [[False god|false]] or [[demon]]ic, and it is believed that any other gods cannot be compared to the one true God.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3260">'''''Exploring Reality: The Intertwining of Science &amp; Religion''''' is a book by [[John Polkinghorne]] which offers a "progress report" on his "search for truth. All my life I have been trying to explore reality.  That exploration includes science, but it also necessarily takes me beyond it.  The process of investigation has a spiral character, as tackling the issues draws the explorer inwards towards a deeper engagement with the multidimensional character of reality"&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring Reality'' pp(ix-x)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication Information==
The book is published by [[SPCK]] in the UK and by [[Yale University Press]] in the USA, in 2005. {{ISBN|0-300-11014-6}}

==Synopsis==
In '''1. Reality''' Polkinghorne explains "how natural the task of exploring reality is for someone whose intellectual formation has been in the sciences"(p xi) and asserts his belief in [[Critical realism (philosophy of perception)|Critical realism]] against [[Postmodernism]].

'''2. The Causal Nexus of the World''' suggests that "scientifically our knowledge is still pretty patchy, excellent within certain well-defined domains but often unable to make satisfactory connections between different domains. The problematic of the relationship of [[Quantum physics]] to [[Classical physics]] provides an instructive example" and also that "matters of [[causality]] ... are not finally settled by science alone. Ultimate conclusions have to rest on the foundation of a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] decision."(p xii)

In '''3. Human Nature''' he notes that [[Charles Kingsley]] and [[Frederick Temple]] welcomed [[Charles Darwin]]'s insights, which also implied a level of continuity between humans and other animals. However he notes that humans abilities in language, science and rationality are very different from those of animals.&lt;ref&gt;pp 41-43&lt;/ref&gt; He says "the fact that we share 98.4% of our DNA with chimpanzees shows the fallacy of genetic reductionism, rather than proving that we are only apes who are slightly different.  After all I share 99.9% of my DNA with [[J. S. Bach]], but that fact carries no implication of a close correspondence between our musical abilities"(p45). He suggests that "while [[natural selection]] has been an important factor in the development of life on Earth, it is by no means obvious that it is the only type of process involved" and that "the attempt to force classical Darwinian thinking into the role of an explanatory principle of almost universal scope has proved singularly unconvincing as it seeks to inflate an assembly of half-truths into a theory of everything".&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit.. pp50-51. He mentions in particular [[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that Evolutionary epistemology is also based on a half-truth. Being able to make sense of everyday experience is a vital asset, yet when [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] discovered universal gravity, something happened that went far beyond anything needed for survival and that rational feats like proving [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] go far beyond anything susceptible to Darwinian explanation.&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit.'' p51-53&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Falling on a grenade''' refers to the deliberate act of using one's body to cover a live [[fuse (explosives)|time-fused]] [[hand grenade]], absorbing the explosion and fragmentation in an effort to save the lives of others nearby. Since this is almost universally fatal, it is considered an especially conspicuous and selfless act of individual sacrifice in wartime; in United States military history, more citations for the [[Medal of Honor]] have been awarded for falling on grenades to save comrades than any other single act.

Such an act can be survivable: In [[World War II]], [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] [[Jacklyn H. Lucas|Jack Lucas]], in the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], placed two grenades under his steel [[M1 Helmet]] and himself before they exploded. Lucas lived, but spent the rest of his life with over 200 pieces of shrapnel in his body. In 2008 near [[Sangin]] in [[Afghanistan]] British [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] [[Matthew Croucher]] used his rucksack to pin the grenade to the floor, and that and his body armor absorbed the majority of the blast. On November 21, 2010 in  [[Marjah]], [[Helmand Province]], [[Afghanistan]] in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], US Marine [[Lance Corporal]] [[Kyle Carpenter]] threw himself upon a grenade, thrown onto a rooftop, to save a fellow Marine, sustaining injuries to his face and right arm and losing his right eye; he survived these wounds. Despite these rare instances, however, the odds of survival are extremely slim.

"Falling on a grenade" is also used colloquially in non-military contexts to indicate individual acceptance of a personally harmful or sacrificial task in an effort to protect a larger group; during a scandal, corporate leaders or politicians who attempt to draw negative attention away from their company or party by pleading guilt, publicly admitting culpability and drawing condemnation on themselves (at the cost of their freedom or career) are often said to have "fallen on a grenade". 

==Examples==
*On July 1, 1916, at the [[Battle of Thiepval Ridge]] in [[World War I]], British Army Private [[William McFadzean]] of the 14th Battalion, the Royal Irish Rifles threw himself on top of a box of [[Mills bomb]]s after the pin came loose on two of them whilst he was attempting to load the bombs into a bandolier. As a result of his action only one other man in the trench was injured in the resulting explosion. McFadzean was posthumously awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].
* On December 19, 1941, at the [[Battle of Hong Kong]], [[Canadian Army]] [[Company Sergeant Major]] [[John Robert Osborn]] jumped on a grenade, sacrificing himself to save his men. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.
* On November 7, 1943, at [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[Sergeant]] [[Herbert Joseph Thomas|Herbert J. Thomas, Jr]] deliberately fell on a grenade, sacrificing himself to protect nearby Marines. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.
* On April 3, 1945, [[Walter C. Wetzel]], threw himself on two grenades thrown by attacking Germans, suffering wounds from which he died. He was awarded the Medal of Honor.
* On September 1, 1950, near [[Yongsan]], [[South Korea]], U.S. Army [[Private First Class]] [[David M. Smith]] noticed an enemy grenade lobbed into his company's emplacement. Smith shouted a warning to his comrades and flung himself upon it. Although he was mortally wounded, his act saved five men from injury or death. He was awarded the Medal of Honor.
* On November 26, 1950, during the Korean war, U.S. Army [[Sergeant]] [[John A. Pittman]] threw himself on the grenade, which was thrown in the midst of his squad, and absorbed the burst with his body. Pittman survived and was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.
* On February 11, 1954, [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] Private [[Nathan Elbaz]] was disarming grenades when he noticed one of the grenade's safeties had slipped. He grabbed the grenade and ran from the tent but realized he would not be able to throw the grenade away without harming some of his friends, so he smothered the explosion with his body. He was posthumously awarded the [[Medal of Distinguished Service]].
* On November 1, 1956, during [[Suez Crisis]], [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] Officer [[Ovad Ladijinski]] threw a grenade towards the opening of a high Egyptian station. The grenade fell back towards him and his group. He pressed the closest soldier to a rock and protected him using his body, facing the grenade. He was posthumously awarded a Chief of General Staff Citation (later changed to [[Medal of Courage]]), which was his second one.
* On February 25, 1966, [[Peter S. Connor]] held a grenade against his body after realizing the fuse was burning despite his holding the safety pin, and he did not have time to throw it safely away from his comrades. He died eleven days later and was awarded the Medal of Honor.
* On August 16, 1966, during a cave search and destroy mission in the Vietnam War, [[Republic of Korea Marine Corps]] Captain Lee In-Ho smothered a grenade to save his men around him. He was posthumously awarded the highest South Korean military honor, the Taegeuk Cordon of Military Merit.
* On February 28, 1967, [[James Anderson, Jr.]] sacrificed his life by smothering a grenade with his body in the [[Vietnam War]] and was awarded a Medal of Honor.
* On September 6, 1967, Sgt. Rodney Maxwell Davis, USMC, threw himself on an enemy grenade in the Quang Nam Province of Vietnam during Operation Swift while under attack from Vietnamese forces.  He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.
* On February 23, 1971, a [[M35 2½-ton cargo truck]] was ambushed by a squad of [[Vietnam People's Army|North Vietnamese Army]] (NVA) soldiers near [[An Khê]]. At one point during the firefight, an NVA soldier threw a fragmentation grenade into the truck's compartment. 21-year-old [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist Four]] [[Larry G. Dahl]] was the only occupant who heard the grenade land in the truck. Realizing that there was not sufficient time to toss it out, he immediately threw himself on top of the grenade, saving his comrades' lives at the cost of his own. Dahl was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.
* On May 25, 1971, [[Michael Willetts]] smothered an explosive device planted at Springfield Road Police Station, Belfast, by a member of the [[Provisional IRA]]. In doing so, he saved the lives of several civilians, including two children. He was posthumously awarded the [[George Cross]] for his actions.
* On April 14, 2004, near [[Husaybah]], [[Iraq]], [[Jason Dunham]] used his body and helmet to shield others from a grenade explosion - but died shortly afterward from his injuries. He was awarded the Medal of Honor.&lt;ref name="whoswho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Whos_Who/Dunham_JL.htm|title=Corporal Jason L. Dunham, USMC (deceased)|work=Who's Who in Marine Corps History |publisher=[[United States Marine Corps History Division]]|accessdate=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On September 3, 2004, in [[Beslan]], [[Russia]], Lt. [[Andrey Turkin]], a member of a Russian counter-terrorist unit "Vympel", smothered a grenade, which was thrown by a terrorist in the school canteen, with his own body in order to shield hostages from the explosion. Lt. Turkin was posthumously awarded the [[Hero of the Russian Federation]] medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Герой России Туркин Андрей Алексеевич|url=http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=6880|accessdate=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* On July 26, 2006, IDF Major [[Roi Klein]], during the [[Battle of Bint Jbeil]], jumped on a grenade thrown into the house where Klein and his unit were present and stopped the explosion with his body.&lt;ref name="Lubotzky"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lubotzky|first=Asael|title=[[From the Wilderness and Lebanon]]|year=2016|publisher=[[Koren Publishers Jerusalem]]|isbn=978-1592644179|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was posthumously awarded the [[Medal of Courage]].
* On September 29, 2006, in [[Iraq]], [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEAL]] [[Michael A. Monsoor]], was killed after smothering a grenade with his own body to protect other SEALs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/15258312/ |title=SEAL falls on grenade to save comrades - US news - Military &amp;#124; NBC News |publisher=MSNBC |date=2006-10-14 |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the Medal of Honor.
* On December 4, 2006, in the Iraqi capital of [[Baghdad]], 19-year-old U.S. Army Spc. [[Ross A. McGinnis]] was killed instantly when he used his body to smother a grenade, saving the lives of four nearby soldiers. He was awarded the Medal of Honor.
* In 2008, near [[Sangin]] in [[Afghanistan]], [[Royal Marine]] Lance Corporal [[Matthew Croucher]] used his body and [[Backpack|rucksack]] to pin a grenade to the floor, with "just a nose bleed" as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harding |first=Thomas |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2445513/Royal-Marine-who-jumped-on-grenade-awarded-George-Cross.html |title=Royal Marine who jumped on grenade awarded George Cross |publisher=Telegraph |date=2008-07-22 |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[George Cross]].
*In July 2010, [[Corporal]] [[Kyle Carpenter]] deployed to Marjah, Helmand Province, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. On November 21, 2010, while joining his team to fight off a Taliban attack in a small village, Carpenter suffered severe injuries to his face and right arm from the blast of an enemy hand grenade; after-action reports state that he threw himself in front of the grenade to protect a fellow Marine. He was awarded the Medal of Honor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25880">'''Genetic monitoring''' is the use of [[Genetic marker|molecular markers]] to (i) identify individuals, species or populations, or (ii) to quantify changes in [[population genetic]] metrics (such as [[effective population size]], [[genetic diversity]] and population size) over time. Genetic monitoring can thus be used to detect changes in species abundance and/or diversity, and has become an important tool in both [[conservation management system|conservation]] and [[livestock]] management. The types of molecular markers used to monitor populations are most commonly [[mitochondrial]], [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellites]] or [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs), while earlier studies also used [[allozyme]] data. Species gene diversity is also recognized as an important [[biodiversity]] metric for implementation of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbd.int/ Website of the Convention on Biological Diversity]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Types of population changes that can be detected by genetic monitoring include population growth and decline, spread of pathogens, adaptation to environmental change, hybridization, introgression and habitat fragmentation events. Most of these changes are monitored using ‘neutral’ [[genetic markers]] (markers for which mutational changes do not change their adaptive [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] within a population). However markers showing adaptive responses to environmental change can be ‘non-neutral’ (e.g. mutational changes affect their relative fitness within a population). [[File:Genetic Monitoring Categories.png|thumb|right|250px|Categories of Genetic Monitoring as defined by Schwartz et al. 2007&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;Schwartz, M.K., et al. (2007) Genetic monitoring as a promising tool for conservation and management. Trends Ecol. Evol. 22, 25&amp;ndash;33. {{DOI|10.1016/j.tree.2006.08.009}}[http://www.rmrs.nau.edu/publications/2007_schwartz_trends/2007_schwartz_trends.pdf PDF fulltext]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Two broad categories of genetic monitoring have been defined:&lt;ref name="Schwartz"/&gt; Category I encompasses the use of genetic markers as identifiers of individuals (Category Ia), populations and species (Category Ib) for traditional population monitoring. Category II represents the use of genetic markers to monitor changes of [[population genetic]] parameters, which include estimators of [[effective population size]] (Ne), genetic variation, population inter-mixing, structure and migration.

==Examples==

===Estimating abundance and life history parameters – Category Ia===
At the individual level, genetic identification can enable estimation of population abundance and population increase rates within the framework of [[mark-recapture]] models. The abundance of cryptic or elusive species that are difficult to monitor can be estimated by collecting non-invasive biological samples in the field (e.g. feathers, scat or fur) and using these to identify individuals through [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] or [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) genotyping. This census of individuals can then be used to estimate population abundance via mark-recapture analysis. For example, this technique has been used to monitor populations of [[grizzly bear]],&lt;ref name="boulanger"&gt;Boulanger, J., et al. (2004) Monitoring of grizzly bear population trends and demography using DNA mark-recapture methods in the Owikeno Lake area of British Columbia. Canadian Journal of Zoology 82, 1267&amp;ndash;1277. {{DOI|10.1139/Z04-100}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[brush-tailed rock-wallaby]],&lt;ref&gt;Piggott, M.P., et al. (2006) Estimating population size of endangered Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata) colonies using faecal DNA. Mol. Ecol. 15, 81&amp;ndash;91. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02783.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bengal tiger]]&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavatula, J., and Singh, L. (2006) Genotyping faecal samples of Bengal tiger Panthera tigris tigris for population estimation: A pilot study. BMC Genet. 7, 48. {{doi|10.1186/1471-2156-7-48}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[snow leopard]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaňecka, J.E., et al. (2008) Population monitoring of snow leopards using noninvasive collection of scat samples: a pilot study. Anim. Conserv. 11, 401&amp;ndash;411. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1469-1795.2008.00195.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population growth rates are a product of rates of population [[Birth rate|recruitment]] and [[Mortality rate|survival]], and can be estimated through open [[mark-recapture]] models. For example, DNA from feathers shed by the [[eastern imperial eagle]] shows lower cumulative survival over time than seen for other long-lived raptors.&lt;ref&gt;Rudnick, J.A., et al. (2005) Using naturally shed feathers for individual identification, genetic parentage analyses, and population monitoring in an endangered Eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca) population from Kazakhstan. Mol. Ecol. 14, 2959&amp;ndash;2967. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02641.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Identifying species &amp;ndash; Category Ib===
Use of molecular genetic techniques to identify species can be useful for a number of reasons. Species identification in the wild can be used to detect changes in population ranges or site occupancy, rates of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and the emergence and spread of [[pathogens]] and [[invasive species]]. Changes in population ranges have been investigated for [[Iberian lynx]]&lt;ref&gt;Fernández, N., et al.

Appl. 16, 1037&amp;ndash;1049. {{DOI|10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[1037:LEICMS]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wolverine]],&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, M.K., et al.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Species identification is also of considerable utility in monitoring [[fisheries]] and [[wildlife trade]], where conventional visual identification of butchered or flensed products is difficult or impossible.&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;Baker, C.S. (2008) A truer measure of the market: the molecular ecology of fisheries and wildlife trade. Mol. Ecol. 17, 3985&amp;ndash;3998. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03867.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Monitoring of trade and consumption of species of conservation interest can be carried out using molecular amplification and identification of meat or fish obtained from markets.  For example, genetic market surveys have been used to identify protected species and populations of whale (e.g., North Pacific [[minke whale]]) and dolphin species appearing in the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, C.S., et al. (2007) Estimating the number of whales entering trade using DNA profiling and capture-recapture analysis of market products. Mol. Ecol. 16, 2617&amp;ndash;2626. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03317.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other surveys of market trade have focused on [[pinnipeds]],&lt;ref&gt;Malik, S., et al. (1997) Pinniped penises in trade: a molecular genetic investigation. Conserv. Biol. 11, 1365&amp;ndash;1374. {{DOI|10.1046/j.1523-1739.1997.96125.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sea horses]]&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, J.G., et al.

(2006) Identification of shark species composition and proportion in the Hong Kong shark fin market based on molecular genetics and trade records. Conserv. Biol. 20, 201&amp;ndash;211. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00247.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such surveys are used to provide ongoing monitoring of the quantity and movement of fisheries and wildlife products through markets and for detecting [[poaching]] or other illegal, unreported or unregulated (IUU) exploitation &lt;ref name="baker"/&gt; (e.g. [[Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing|IUU fishing]]).

Although initial applications focused on species identification and population assessments, market surveys also provide the opportunity for a range of molecular ecology investigations including capture-recapture, assignment tests and population modeling.&lt;ref name="baker"/&gt; These developments are potentially relevant to genetic monitoring Category II.

===Monitoring population genetic parameters – Category II===
Monitoring of population changes through genetic means can be done retrospectively, through analysis of [[Ancient DNA|'historical' DNA]] recovered from museum-archived species and comparison with contemporary DNA of that species. It can also be used as a tool for evaluating ongoing changes in the status and persistence of current populations.  Genetic measures of relative population change include changes in diversity (e.g. [[heterozygosity]] and allelic richness). Monitoring of relative population changes through these metrics has been performed retrospectively for [[Beringia]]n [[bison]],&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, B., et al. (2004) Rise and fall of the Beringian Steppe Bison.

Genetic monitoring has also been increasingly used in studies that monitor environmental changes through changes in the frequency of adaptively selected markers. For example, the genetically controlled photo-periodic response (hibernating time) of pitcher-plant mosquitos (''[[Wyeomyia smithii]]'') has shifted in response to longer growing seasons for pitcher plants brought on by warmer weather.&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw, W.E., and Holzapfel, C.M. (2001) Genetic shift in photoperiodic response correlated with global warming. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98, 14509&amp;ndash;14511. {{DOI|10.1073/pnas.241391498}} [http://www.pnas.org/content/98/25/14509.full.pdf PDF fulltext]&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental [[wheat]] populations grown in contrasting environments over a period of 12 generations found that changes in [[flowering]] time were closely correlated with regulatory changes in one gene, suggesting a pathway for genetic adaptation to changing climate in plants.&lt;ref&gt;Rhoné, B., et al. (2008) Insight into the genetic bases of climatic adaptation in experimentally evolving wheat populations. Mol. Ecol. 17, 930&amp;ndash;943. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03619.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strasburg, J.L., and Gross, B.L.

Genetic monitoring is also useful in monitoring the ongoing health of small, relocated populations. Good examples of this are found for [[New Zealand birds]], many species of which were greatly impacted by habitat destruction and the appearance of numerous mammalian predators in the last century and have recently become part of relocation programs that transfer a few ‘founder’ individuals to predator-free offshore [[Ecological island|“ecological” islands]]. E.g. [[black robin]],&lt;ref&gt;Ardern, S.L., and Lambert, D.M. (1997) Is the black robin in genetic peril? Mol. Ecol. 6, 21&amp;ndash;28. {{DOI|10.1046/j.1365-294X.1997.00147.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[kakapo]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, H.C., et al. (2003) Minisatellite DNA profiling detects lineages and parentage in endangered kakapo (Strigops habroptilus) despite low microsatellite DNA variation. Conserv. Genet. 4, 265&amp;ndash;274. {{DOI|10.1023/A:1024037601708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of genetic monitoring in science==
In February 2007 an international summit was held at the Institute of the Environment at [[UCLA]], concerning ‘Evolutionary Change in Human Altered Environments: An International Summit to translate Science into Policy’. This led to a special issue of the journal of [[Molecular ecology#Molecular Ecology (journal)|Molecular Ecology]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ioe.ucla.edu/ctr/symposium/docs/Summit-Report.pdf A Report on the Results and Recommendations of the International Summit on Evolutionary Change in Human-altered Environments]&lt;/ref&gt; organized around our understanding of genetic effects in three main categories: (i) habitat disturbance and [[climate change]] (ii) exploitation and [[captive breeding]] (iii) [[invasive species]] and [[pathogens]].

In 2007 a [[Working group|Working Group]] on Genetic Monitoring was launched with joint support from [[NCEAS]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NESCent]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nescent.org The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center]&lt;/ref&gt; to further develop the techniques involved and provide general monitoring guidance for policy makers and managers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/featured/allendorf Genetic Monitoring: Development of Tools for Conservation and Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the topic is covered in several well known text books, including McComb et al. (2010) and Allendorf et al. (2013)

==Genetic monitoring in natural resource agencies==
Many [[natural resource]] agencies see genetic monitoring as a cost-effective and defensible way to monitor fish and wildlife populations.  As such scientists in the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]], [[USFS|U.S. Forest Service]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/wildlife/genetics/index.php Rocky Mountain Research Station Wildlife Genetics Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Park Service]], and [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] have been developing new methods and tools to use genetic monitoring, and applying such tools across broad geographic scales.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kendall"/&gt;  Currently the USFWS hosts a website that informs managers as to the best way to use genetic tools for monitoring (see below).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23470">'''Giuseppe Di Giacomo''' (born 1 January 1945 in [[Avola]], [[Italy]]) is an Italian [[philosopher]] and essayist.
[[File:Giuseppe Di Giacomo.jpg|thumb|Giuseppe Di Giacomo]]

Author of about a hundred scientific publications on the relationship between aesthetics and literature,&lt;ref&gt;His most important work on the relationship between aesthetics and literature is ''Estetica e letteratura. Il grande romanzo tra Ottocento e Novecento'', Laterza, 1999, rpt. 2010; Spanish translation, Valencia, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on the relationship between aesthetics and the visual arts, with an emphasis on modern and contemporary culture, and on topics such as the image, representation, the art/life nexus, memory and the notion of testimony.

==Biography==
Before undertaking his university career, immediately after graduating in Philosophy (with professor Emilio Garroni), Di Giacomo taught in senior high schools and, even before that, while still a university student, he was a substitute teacher for several months in various junior high schools. In 1976, he was awarded a contract to teach Epistemology at the Faculty of Natural, mathematical and physical sciences of the University of Parma, and obtained a permanent position in the same university two years later. On 28 February 1987 he became a researcher at ''Sapienza'' University of Rome, where, starting from 19 October 1993, he became Associate Professor and, from 1 November 2001, Full Professor of Aesthetics.
Since November 2012, he has been the Director of MLAC (Museo Laboratorio di Arte Contemporanea/Laboratory Museum of Contemporary Art), ''Sapienza'' University. He is a member of the Teaching Staff of the Ph.D. in Philosophy of the same university, where he also served, for six years, as President of the Master’s Degree of the former Faculty of Philosophy.
He has coordinated national research projects (Progetti PRIN) and has taken part in international research projects. Over the last decade, he has coordinated university researches (Ricerche di Ateneo) involving more than thirty scholars from different study areas and focussing on aesthetic-philosophical and literary-artistic topics.

He edited, with Claudio Zambianchi, the anthology ''Alle origini dell'opera d'arte contemporanea'' (Roma-Bari, Laterza, 2008; 4th ed. 2012)

He is a founding member of SIE (''Società Italiana di Estetica/Italian Society of Aesthetics'').

He is the editor of the book series ''Figure dell'estetica'' of the publishing house Alboversorio (Milan).

He is a member of the scientific board of the following journals 
* Paradigmi
* Studi di estetica
* Rivista di estetica
* Estetica. Studi e ricerche
* Comprendre. Revista catalana de filosofia

Di Giacomo is also a member of the scientific board of ''Aesthetica Preprint'', a book series of the ''Centro Internazionale Studi di Estetica'' (''International Centre for the Study of Aesthetics'').

== Thought==
Di Giacomo maintains that, in order to tackle the issue of the image today, it is necessary to refuse both an interpretation of the image as a mere mirror of things and its interpretation as an exclusively self-referential system of signs. Based on his reading of Wittgenstein, he draws the conclusion that logical representation entails something that manifests itself and, while doing so, remains ‘other’, distinct from the visibility of the representation itself.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Dalla logica all'estetica'', pp. 97-147&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in presenting itself, the image manifests the other of the visible, of the representable: that other which reveals itself in the visible, by hiding from it. And this is precisely how the image becomes an icon of the invisible.

However, starting from Adorno’s reflection, the image tends to lose its figurative character but, at the same time, it continues to exist;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Alle origini dell'opera d'arte contemporanea'', pp. 203-222&lt;/ref&gt; the image is, indeed, both a thing and a non-thing: a paradoxical “real unreality”.  This ensues from the attempt to divide the double-edged nature of the image into its constituent elements: on the one hand, a readymade in which the representational dimension melts into a purely presentational dimension, and, on the other hand, a solely mental image endowed with a weak material support.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Astrazione e astrazioni'', pp. 11-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the images of the new media are images of images and, in this sense, they are not even proper images but simulations, “simulacra”. It is no coincidence that digital images, as reproductions, have a low value as images, because they tend to acquire the aspect of something, thus losing that connection between transparency and opacity which characterises authentic images. Hence, indeed, the question whether new media are able to create real images.
More particularly, it is in the kind of art that Adorno defines as “modern” that we find an overcoming of the epiphanic dimension that distinguishes the icon, where the visible is the place of manifestation of the invisible as Absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "La questione dell'aura tra Benjamin e Adorno", Rivista di Estetica, 52 (1/20013), p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; As we have become aware of the impossibility to exhaust the whole of reality and, at the same time, to manifest the Absolute, what emerges now is a conception of the image as something that can be interrogated as a testimony of what does not allow itself to be translated into an image: to testify is indeed to tell what cannot be told completely. In this sense, testimony coincides not with memory, as consistent with what happened, but with the immemorial, which refers to something we can neither remember nor forget completely, that is something that is neither totally speakable nor totally unspeakable.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Volti della memoria'', pp. 445-481&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, a witness only speaks starting from the impossibility to speak. That the image is equivalent to testimony means, then, that the attempt to say the unsayable is an infinite task, and this is why the question of the image forms an integral part of the ethical question. This entails that in the image there is no completeness and, consequently, neither redemption nor reconciliation with the real. From this point of view, to consider the image as testimony is tantamount to seeing it as the place of a perpetually unresolved tension between memory and oblivion, thus as the expression of the imperative of sense in a context, such as the contemporary one, in which both world and art seem to be increasingly abandoned to non-sense.

'''Goethean science''' concerns the [[natural philosophy]] (German ''Naturphilosophie'' "philosophy of nature") of German writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. Although primarily known as a literary figure, Goethe did research in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[anatomy]], and [[optics]]. He also developed a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] approach to [[natural history]], an alternative to Enlightenment natural science, which is still debated today among scholars.

His works in natural history include his 1790 ''[[Metamorphosis of Plants]]'' and his 1810 book ''[[Theory of Colors]]''. His work in optics, and his [[polemic]]s against the reigning [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] theory of optics, were poorly received by the natural history establishment of his time.

==Background==
By the middle of the 1700s, [[Western philosophy]] had reached an ethical and epistemological cul-de-sac. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] or [[Age of Reason]] was based on a static view of human nature, an increasingly mechanical view of the universe (based on:
- [[heliocentrism|Copernican astronomy]], 
- [[Galilean invariance|Galilean mechanics]] and 
- [[classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]) and 
- a linear view of the progress of scientific knowledge (the mechano-material, reductionist approach). {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The exclusively rationalist approach, was termed by Ernst Lehrs as the 'one-eyed, color blind' perspective of the world,&lt;ref name=Lehrs&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lehrs|first1=Ernst|title=Man or Matter|date=1951|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/manormatter05641gut|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An exclusively rationalist approach to life raises fundamental issues about "God, freedom and immortality" ([[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]) of growing concern to a culture undergoing significant economic, political and cultural transformation. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The rationalist scientific method, which had worked well with inert nature ([[Francis Bacon|Bacon]]'s ''natura naturata''), was less successful in seeking to understand vital nature (''natura naturans''). At the same time, the rational-empirical model based on the predominance of mentative thinking (German: ''sinnen'') via the intellect (German: ''[[Sinn]]''), started by [[Descartes]] and advanced most notably in France, was leading to confusion and doubt rather than clarity.  Especially in subjective topics, equally rational arguments could be made for widely divergent propositions or conceptions. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The more empirical approach favored in Britain ([[David Hume|Hume]]) had led to viewing reality as sense-based, including the mind; how, what we perceive is only a mental representation of what is real, and what is real we can never really know. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

As one observer summarizes, there were two 'games' being played in philosophy at the time – one rational and one empirical, both of which led to total skepticism and an epistemological crisis.&lt;ref name="waldorflibrary.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amrine|first1=Frederick|title=The Philosophical Roots of Waldorf Education|journal=Waldorf Research Bulletin|date=2012|volume=17|issue=2|url=http://www.waldorflibrary.org/journals/22-research-bulletin/1203-autumnwinter-2012-volume-17-2-the-philosophical-roots-of-waldorf-education-part-one|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Kantian problem==
[[Immanuel Kant]] in Prussia undertook a major rescue operation to preserve the validity of knowledge derived via reason (science), as well as of knowledge going beyond the rational mind, that is of human liberty and of life beyond simply an expression of 'the chance whirlings of unproductive particles' ([[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]). Kant's writings had an immediate and major impact on Western philosophy and triggered a philosophical movement known as [[German idealism]] ([[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]), which sought to overcome and transcend the chasm Kant had formalized between the sense-based and the super-sensible worlds, in his attempt to 'save the appearances' ([[Owen Barfield]]), that is, to preserve the validity of scientific or rational knowledge as well as that of faith.

Kant's solution was an epistemological dualism: we cannot know the thing-in-itself (''Das Ding an Sich'') beyond our mental representation of it.  While there is a power (productive imagination – ''produktive Einbildungskraft'') that produces a unity ("transcendental unity of apperception"), we cannot know or experience it in itself; we can only see its manifestations and create representations about it in our mind. The realm beyond the senses also could not be known via reason, but only via faith. To seek to know the realm beyond the senses amounts to what Kant termed an 'adventure of reason'.&lt;ref name="waldorflibrary.org"/&gt;

==Goethe's approach to vital nature==
Goethe undertook his 'adventure of reason', starting with the "crisis" in botany, the merely and purely mechanical classification-taxonomy of plant life.  In so doing Goethe also "wagered a sweeping theory about Nature itself."&lt;ref name=Wellmon&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wellmon|first1=Chad|title=Goethe's Morphology of Knowledge, or the Overgrowth of Nomenclature|journal=Goethe Yearbook|date=2010|volume=17|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/goethe_yearbook/v017/17.wellmon.html|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goethe was concerned with the narrowing specialization in science and emphasis on accumulating data in a merely mechanical manner, devoid of human values and human development.  Linnaean botanic taxonomic system represented this in his day, a ''Systema naturae.''  Goethe intuited the practice of rational science promoted a narrowing and contracting interplay between humanity and Nature. For Goethe any science based only on physical-material characteristics and then only selected external traits, led to epistemic impoverishment and a reduction of human knowledge.&lt;ref name="Wellmon"/&gt;

What was needed was increased ability to derive meaning from voluminous external data by looking at it from both external-sensory angles; and, from an internal angle where thinking, Feeling, Intuition, Imagination and Inspiration could all contribute to conclusions reached by the experimenter.  

Linnaean taxonomy was already coming under criticism from [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]], who argued the mechanistic classification of the outer forms of nature (natura naturata) needed to be replaced by a study of the interrelation of natural forces and natural historical change.&lt;ref name=Rogers&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roger|first1=Jacques|title=The Life of Sciences in Eighteenth-Century French Thought|date=1998|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Palo Alto|pages=426–29|url=http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=3027|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Goethe, the production of new knowledge is inseparable from a ''Geschichte des Denkens und Begreifens,'' a history of thinking and conceptualization.&lt;ref name="Wellmon"/&gt; Knowledge is also about association, not only about separation, as Coleridge also was at pains to explain in his ''Essays on Method'' (see [[Romantic epistemology]]).

While arranging material phenomena in logical linear sequence is a valid scientific method, it had to be carried out under a correct and humanistic organizing idea (Bacon's ''lumen siccum''), itself grounded in Nature, or natural law (often boundaried by multiple, lawful pairs of polarity).

Goethe proposed experimenters seek the natural, lawful organizing ideas and/or archetype behind specific natural phenomena.  Phase One was to immerse one's self in a living interaction with the natural phenomena to be studied, with all available senses.  Goethe valued "the labor of experimentation".&lt;ref name="waldorflibrary.org"/&gt; 

This contrasted greatly with a trend in rational Natural Science, to 'abandon' Nature herself, formulate an abstract hypothesis; then, experiment to test whether your hypothesis can be verified or not.  Goethe considered this an 'artificial experience' which 'tears' individual manifestations out of the meaningful context of the whole (for example, Newton's color hypothesis). 

Instead, Goethe's experimenter must adopt a more living, more humane, approach aspiring to entering into the living essence of Nature, as perceived in the phenomenon studied.  

For Goethe success meant penetrating to the crucial underlying, sensorily-invisible archetype-pattern (''Ur-phänomen'').  The Experimenter aspires to allow the phenomena to reveal its inherent order and lawfulness.  While often invisible, this lawfulness is clearly objective not subjective, not invented by the experimenter (see Goethe's description of a dandelion or Steiner's copied version).  

Ernst Lehrs went further in emphasizing how all objective manifestation comes from movement, physical-material objects as motion come to rest (Man or Matter, 3rd ed preferred).

Goethean Science stands apart from Cartesian-Newtonian Science; its alternative value system sets it apart.  Regarding quantification, Goethean Science is nonetheless rigorous as to experimental method and the matter of qualities.&lt;ref name="waldorflibrary.org"/&gt;

Goethe's student and editor of his works, [[Rudolf Steiner]], applied Goethe's methodology of a living approach to Nature to the performing and fine arts. This gives [[Anthroposophy|Anthroposophic]] visual and performing arts their air of going beyond the mere outer form of things (''natura naturata'') to discern a more inner nature (''natura naturans'').  Steiner hoped to relate the human sphere with all of Nature through the arts; including, the art of Goethean Science.

==Goethe's Ur-phenomena==
Five arts was Goethe's method of transmuting his observation of human nature into sharable form.  Drawing from his novel, ''[[Elective Affinities]]'' (''Wahlverwandschaften''), Goethe discerned a ''geheime Verwandschaft'' (hidden relationship) of parts that explains how one form can transform into another form while being part of an underlying [[Archetype|archetypal]] form (''Ur-phänomen'').

It is this organizing idea or form that guides the consideration of the parts; it is a ''Bild'' or virtual image that "emerges and re-emerges from the interaction of experience and ideas".&lt;ref name="Wellmon"/&gt; This consideration is a special type of thinking ([[Noesis|noetic]] ideation or ''denken'') carried out with a different organ of cognizance to that of the brain (mentation  or ''sinnen''), one that involves an act of creative imagination, what Goethe terms "the living imaginal beholding of Nature" (''das lebendige Anschauen der Natur''). Goethe's nature (''natura naturans'', the activity of "nature naturing" – as distinguished from ''natura naturata'', "nature natured", the domain of naturally formed ''objects'') is one in constant flux and flow, but nonetheless governed by law, logic and intelligence above the mind. To approach vital nature requires a different cognitive capacity (''denken'') and cognitive organ (''Gemüt'') from that used to perceive inert nature (''sinnen'' based on the Intellect or ''Sinn'').

==Experiment as interactive experience==
In his 1792 essay "The experiment as mediator between subject and object", Goethe developed an original [[philosophy of science]], which he used in his research. The essay underscores his experiential standpoint. "The human being himself, to the extent he makes sound use of his senses, is the most exact physical apparatus that can exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Goethe | first = Johann | editor-last = Miller | editor-first = Douglas | title = Scientific Studies (Goethe: The Collected Works, Vol. 12), p.57 | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]] |date=October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the fixed Linnaean system, like classical physics, its distinctions broke down increasingly at the border, reflected in the increasing confusion as to how to classify the growing number of plant forms being brought forward.  This led to greater division rather than greater unity. Goethe's discovery of an underlying order directly challenged the fixed, static view of nature of the Linnaean taxonomy (based on artificial types arrived at by choosing certain features and ignoring others), but also the tendency of natural science to study vital nature by means of the methodology used on inert nature (physics, chemistry).

The Cartesian-Newtonian method presupposes separation between observer and observed.  Goethe considered this a barrier.  As Wellmon observes, Goethe's concept of science is one in which "not only the object of observation changes and moves but also the subject of observation." Thus, a true science of vital nature would be based on an approach that was itself vital, dynamic, labile. The key for this is a living, direct, interactive experience (''Erlebnis'') involving the mind, but also higher faculties more  participatory and Imaginative (''Gemüt''), not dissociative and separative (''Sinn'').&lt;ref name="Wellmon"/&gt;

Only since the 1970s have other mainstream scientists come to be interested in Goethe's more holistic-humanistic approach to experiments. 

In his study on color (''Farbenlehre''), Goethe challenged the view observers can look devoid and naive of theoretical context; likewise, challenging the assumption of shared common neutral language in science research and innovation.   Rather Goethe believed every act of looking at a thing turns into observation, every act of observation turns into mentation, every act of mentation turns into associations.  Thus it is evident  we theorize every time we look attentively out into the world."  In support of Goethe, Feyerabend wrote: "Newton... did not give the explanation [of light] but simply re-described what he saw...[and] introduced the machinery of the very same theory he wanted to prove."&lt;ref name="waldorflibrary.org"/&gt;

For Goethe, the ultimate aim of science was two-fold, both increase to the database of human knowledge; second, as a method for the metamorphosis of the experimenter.&lt;ref name="waldorflibrary.org"/&gt; In Goethean Science, experiment is the 'mediator between object [natural phenomena] and subject ]the experimenter].'  All experiments then become two-fold, potentially revealing as much about a natural phenomena as they reveal the experimenter to him or herself.

Goethe's methodology is mutual and intimate interaction of observer and observed; and, what transpires over time.  Ideally as the experimenter's observed knowledge grows from his study of natural phenomena, so does his capacity for inner awareness, insight, Imagination, Intuition and Inspiration. 

Where Cartesian-Newtonian science accepts only a single, practical syllogism about experimenters and research topics, Goethean Science demonstrates practicing science as an art, practice directed towards refining the experimenter's perceptions over time, heightening them towards Imagination, Inspiration and Intuition.

==Goethe's epistemology==
Goethe's method of science as art, of experiment as mediator between experimenter and Nature, can be applied to studies of every kind.  Where Cartesian-Newtonian science defines and values "expansion of knowledge" as a logical and linear march towards accumulating facts, Goethean Science defines and values "expansion of knowledge" as:
1) Observing organic transformation in natural phenomena over time (historical progression); and
2) Organic transformation of the inner life of the experimenter.  

Goethe developed two dynamic concepts – one of polarity (developed in his ''Chromatology'') and one of logical-linear sequence (''Morphology'').  These are applicable across all domains.

For Goethe understanding vital nature (''natura naturans'') is very much a function of taking impressions and activating thereby responses via the Gemüt (empathy, perhaps also compassion) so that one 'becomes what one perceives'.&lt;ref name="waldorflibrary.org"/&gt; This approach offers a way out of the current nihilism and downward spiral of Cartesian-Newtonian science.

The Kantian view is the realm of quantity and thing is separate from quality and phenomenon.  Therefore we can never be certain what we perceive is objectively real. 

Goethe's new way of thinking (''denken'') is a parallel order of science [more a distinct, separate, more holistic paradigm], useful for getting past the heavy cognitive curtain erected by Kant, where only utilitarian ideas and science are valued.  

As Amrine states, Goethe accepted the mathematical approach (''mathesis'') was appropriate for inert nature.  However to become truly human, we cannot hold mathesis at the center of our life--apart from and dominating over--rational Feeling.  Anything less than truly human values at the center of our life are inappropriate and counter-productive.

==Goethe and the idea of evolution==
Goethe writes in ''Story of My Botanical Studies'' (1831): 
{{quote|The ever-changing display of plant forms, which I have followed for so many years, awakens increasingly within me the notion: The plant forms which surround us were not all created at some given point in time and then locked into the given form, they have been given… a felicitous mobility and plasticity allowing them to grow and adapt themselves to many different conditions in many different places.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Teichmann (tr. Jon McAlice) [http://www.waldorfresearchinstitute.org/pdf/BAIdeaEvolTeich.pdf "The Emergence of the Idea of Evolution in the Time of Goethe"] first published in ''Interdisciplinary Aspects of
Evolution'', Urachhaus (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Andrew Dickson White]] also writes with respect to evolutionary thought, in ''[[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'' (1896):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
About the end of the eighteenth century fruitful suggestions and even clear presentations of this or that part of a large evolutionary doctrine came thick and fast, and from the most divergent quarters. Especially remarkable were those from [[Erasmus Darwin]] in England, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]] in France, [[Lorenz Oken|Oken]] in Switzerland, and  [[wikiquote:Johann Gottfried Herder#Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit .281784-91.29|Herder]], and, most brilliantly of all, from Goethe in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Dickson White, ''A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=8EXID2XVPzEC&amp; Vol.1] p.62 (1896)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Recent research==
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] expanded on Goethe's research in optics using a different methodology in his ''[[On Vision and Colors]]''.

[[Rudolf Steiner]] presents Goethe's approach to science as [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] in the Kürschner edition of Goethe's writings.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner edited the scientific writings of Goethe for the ''Kürschner edition of the German National Literature'' (1883–1897).&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner elaborated on this in the books ''Goethean Science'' (1883)&lt;ref&gt;[[Rudolf Steiner]], ''Goethean Science''. Mercury Press, 1988 {{ISBN|0-936132-92-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-936132-92-1}} [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA001/English/MP1988/GA001_index.html e-text]&lt;/ref&gt; and
''Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception'' (1886).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA002/ e-text]&lt;/ref&gt; in which he emphasizes the need of the perceiving organ of intuition in order to grasp Goethe's biological archetype (i.e. ''The Typus'').

[[Rudolf Steiner#Goethean science|Steiner's branch of Goethean Science]] was extended by [[Oskar Schmiedel]] and [[Wilhelm Pelikan]], who did research using Steiner's interpretations.

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s discussions of Goethe's ''Theory of Colors'' were published as ''Bemerkungen über die Farben'' (''Remarks on Color'').&lt;ref&gt;''Bemerkungen über die Farben'', ed. by G.E.M. Anscombe (1977) Remarks on Colour {{ISBN|0-520-03727-8}}. Remarks on Goethe's Theory of Colours.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goethe's vision of [[Holism in science|holistic science]] inspired biologist and [[paranormal]] researcher [[Rupert Sheldrake]].&lt;blockquote&gt;He went to an [[Worksop College|Anglican boarding school]] and then took biology at [[Clare College, Cambridge|Cambridge]], studying "life" by killing animals and then grinding them up to extract their [[DNA]]. This was troubling. Rescue came when a friend turned him on to Goethe. This old German's 18th century vision of "holistic science" appealed to the young Brit very much. Sheldrake used Goethe to investigate how the lilies of the field actually become lilies of the field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/people/feature/1999/11/23/sheldrake/print.html "Rupert Sheldrake: The delightful crackpot"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724083753/http://www.salon.com/people/feature/1999/11/23/sheldrake/print.html |date=2009-07-24 }} by David Bowman, ''[[Salon.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Sheldrake is famous for the term "morphogenetic field" actually a quote from one of Steiner's students, Poppelbaum.

American philosopher [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] argued that [[Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]] was a "poetic science" in Goethe's sense.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Arnold Kaufmann ''Goethe, Kant, and Hegel: Discovering the Mind'' [[Transaction Publishers]], 1991 {{ISBN|0-88738-370-X}}, {{ISBN|978-0-88738-370-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=iDIs2uDBaW4C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=%22poetic+science%22+goethe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5WHy9uOGZM&amp;sig=J9LG5TARzIQH_yilQxfjlGscYJM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5BwgS6usBs-JnQefpMzWDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22poetic%20science%22%20goethe&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

In 1998, David Seamon and [[Arthur Zajonc]] wrote ''Goethe's way of science: a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of nature''.&lt;ref&gt;David Seamon, [[Arthur Zajonc]], ''Goethe's way of science: a phenomenology of nature'' Suny series in environmental and architectural phenomenology [[SUNY Press]], 1998 {{ISBN|0-7914-3681-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-3681-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1998, [[Henri Bortoft]] wrote ''The Wholeness of Nature: Goethe's Science of Conscious Participation in Nature''&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Bortoft]], ''The Wholeness of Nature: Goethe's Science of Conscious Participation in Nature'' (Hudson, NY: Lindesfarne Press, 1996) {{ISBN|978-0940262799}} {{ISBN|0940262797}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he discusses the relevance and importance of Goethe's approach to modern scientific thought.

[[Biologist]] [[Brian Goodwin]] (1931-2009) in his book How the ''Leopard Changed Its Spots : The Evolution of Complexity'' claimed that organisms as dynamic systems are the primary agents of creative evolutionary adaptation, in the book Goodwin stated: "The ideas I am developing in this book are very much in the Goethean spirit."&lt;ref&gt;How the Leopard Changed Its Spots : The Evolution of Complexity, Brian Goodwin, Princeton University Press, 2001, p. 136 {{ISBN|0-691-08809-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gudo Wafu Nishijima''' (西嶋愚道和夫 Nishijima Gudō Wafu, 29 November 1919 – 28 January 2014) was a [[Japan]]ese [[Zen]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] priest and teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sweepingzen.com/obituary-gudo-wafu-nishijima/|title=Obituary: Gudo Wafu Nishijima|publisher=Sweeping Zen|accessdate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

As a young man in the early 1940s, Nishijima became a student of the noted Zen teacher [[Kōdō Sawaki]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dogensangha.org/gwn.htm|title=Introducing Master Gudo Wafu Nishijima|publisher=Dogen Sangha|accessdate=2005-12-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201031049/http://www.dogensangha.org/gwn.htm|archivedate=2005-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the end of the [[Second World War]], Nishijima received a law degree from [[Tokyo University]] and began a career in [[finance]]. It was not until 1973, when he was in his mid-fifties, that Nishijima was ordained as a Buddhist priest. His preceptor for this occasion was [[Rempo Niwa]],&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; a former head of the [[Soto Zen]] sect. Four years later, Niwa gave him [[Dharma transmission|shiho]], formally accepting him as one of his successors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nishijima|first1=Gudō Wafu|last2=Cohen|first2=Jundo|authorlink2=Jundo Cohen|title=A Heart to Heart Chat on Buddhism with Old Master Gudo|publisher=PageFree Publishing, Inc.|year=2004|page=110|ISBN=9781589612129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nishijima continued his professional career until 1979.

During the 1960s, Nishijima began giving regular public lectures on Buddhism and [[zazen|Zen meditation]]. From the 1980s, he lectured in [[English language|English]] and had a number of foreign students, including [[Mike Luetchford]], his first Western Dharma Heir and founder of Dogen Sangha UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dogensangha.org.uk/ |title=Dogen Sangha Bristol }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeffrey Bailey]], co-author with Nishijima of 'To Meet the Real Dragon,'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Meet-Real-Dragon-Gudo-Nishijima/dp/0956299903/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1425080329&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=to+meet+the+real+dragon |title=To Meet the Real Dragon }}&lt;/ref&gt; American author [[Brad Warner]], and teacher Jundo Cohen. In 2007, Nishijima and a group of his students organized as the [[Dogen Sangha International]]. In April 2012, Warner dissolved the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hardcorezen.blogspot.com/2012/04/dogen-sangha-international-is-no-more.html |title=Dogen Sangha International is No More |publisher=Hardcorezen.blogspot.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hardcorezen.blogspot.com/2012/04/dogen-sangha-international-post-mortem.html |title=Dogen Sangha International Post Mortem |publisher=Hardcorezen.blogspot.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nishijima was the author of several books in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and English. He was also a notable translator of [[Buddhist texts]]: working with student and Dharma heir [[Mike Chodo Cross]], Nishijima compiled one of three complete English versions of [[Dōgen]]'s ninety-five-fascicle ''Kana [[Shōbōgenzō|Shobogenzo]]''; he also translated Dogen's ''[[Shinji Shōbōgenzō]]''. He also published an English translation of [[Nagarjuna]]'s ''[[Fundamental Verses of the Middle Way]]'' (''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā'').

Nishijima had not been in good health for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gudoblog-e.blogspot.com/2011/01/announcement.html |title=Announcement |publisher=Dogen Sangha Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported by family that his final words, upon refusing further medical treatment, were, "I decide my death time by myself." Nishijima was often heard to say in teaching that "Life is just the fact in this moment; death is just the fact in this moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G0Pdq1ESf0 |title=Buddhist Life |publisher=The Story of Gudo Wafu Nishijima (Documentary) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three philosophies and one reality==

While studying the ''Shōbōgenzō'', Nishijima developed a theory he called "three philosophies and one reality,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nishijima Gudo Wafu|year=1987|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/DogenStudies/three_philosophies.pdf|title=Three Philosophies and One Reality|format=pdf|publisher=Windbell Publications, Tokyo|accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which presents his distinctive interpretation of the [[Four Noble Truths]] as well as explaining the structure of [[Dogen]]'s writing. According to Nishijima, Dōgen carefully constructed the ''Shōbōgenzō'' according to a fourfold structure, in which he described each issue from four different perspectives. The first perspective is "[[idealism|idealist]]," "[[abstraction|abstract]]," "[[spirituality|spiritual]]," and "[[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]]"; Nishijima says this is the correct interpretation of the first Noble Truth (in mainstream Buddhism, the first Noble Truth is ''[[dukkha]]''). The second perspective is "concrete," "[[materialism|materialistic]]," "[[science|scientific]]," and "[[Object (philosophy)|objective]]" (in mainstream Buddhism, ''samudaya''). The third perspective is described as an integration of the first two, producing a "[[Philosophical realism|realistic]]" synthesis (mainstream, ''nirodha''). The fourth perspective is [[reality]] itself, which Nishijima argues cannot be contained in philosophy or stated in words, but which Dōgen attempts to suggest through [[poetry]] and [[symbol]]ism.  In mainstream Buddhism, the fourth Noble Truth is the [[Eightfold Path]].{{ref|1}}

Nishijima stated that "Buddhism is just Humanism"&lt;ref&gt;[http://gudoblog-e.blogspot.com/2007/04/buddhism-and-humanism.html Buddhism and Humanism]&lt;/ref&gt; and he explains [[Dogen]]'s teaching on [[zazen]] in terms of balancing the [[Autonomic Nervous System|autonomic nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dogensangha.org/downloads/ANS&amp;Buddhism.PDF The Relation Between the Autonomic Nervous System and Buddhism]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7306">'''Hamzah Fansuri''' ([[Jawi script|Jawi]]: حمزه فنسوري ; also spelled '''Hamzah Pansuri''', d. {{circa}} 1590 ?) was a 16th century [[Sumatra]]n [[Sufi]] writer, and the first writer known to pen [[mysticism|mystical]] [[panentheist]]ic ideas in the [[Malay language]].  He also wrote poetry in addition to his prose, and he is considered to be the first known poet of the Malay world.

==Life==

Information on Hamzah's life comes largely from the ''[[takhallus]] [[beit|bait]]''  (pen-name stanza) that ends his poetry (''[[syair]]''), as well as from the work of his disciple Hasan Fansuri and commentaries on Hamzah's poems. However, many of his biographical details are uncertain.&lt;ref name="braginsky"/&gt; His name indicates that he may be from [[Barus]] (also known as Fansur to the Arabs), or have spent a large part of his life there.&lt;ref name="feener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ooi"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&amp;pg=PA561&amp;lpg=PA561 |title=Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor, Band 1 |editor= Keat Gin Ooi |page=561 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |date=13 October 2004|isbn= 978-1576077702}}&lt;/ref&gt; A link to the Siamese [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] (''Shahr-i-Naw'') has also been proposed, although it may be that he travelled to Ayutthaya rather than that being his birth place.&lt;ref name="drewes"&gt;G.W.J. Drewes and L.F. Brakel (eds. and tr.). ''The poems of Hamzah Fansuri''. Dordrecht and Cinnaminson: Foris Publications, 1986. {{ISBN|90-6765-080-3}}, pp-3–18&lt;/ref&gt;  He was known as a Sufi spiritual master and it is thought that he may have worked at the court of the [[Aceh Sultanate]].

Hamzah travelled widely, and was known to have visited the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughal India]], [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], and [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="ooi"/&gt;  He was one of the first Southeast Asians to complete the [[hajj]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Somers Heidhues. ''Southeast Asia: A Concise History''. London: Thames and Hudson, 2000. p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; The date of his death is generally assumed to be around 1590 or earlier,&lt;ref name="drewes"/&gt; although a later date during the reign of Sultan [[Iskandar Muda]] had also been proposed.&lt;ref name="braginsky"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/arch_0044-8613_1999_num_57_2_3521 |title=Towards the Biography of Hamzah Fansuri. When Did Hamzah Live ? Data From His Poems and Early European Accounts |author=Vladimir I. Braginsky|journal=Archipel  |date= 1999  |volume= 57  |issue= 2  |pages= 135–175 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an inscription on a gravestone found in Mecca for a Shaykh Hamza b. Abd Allah al-Fansuri recorded a date of April 11, 1527.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/arch_0044-8613_2001_num_62_1_3656 |title =On the Copy of Hamzah Fansuri's Epitaph Published by C. Guillot &amp; L. Kalus|author=Vladimir I. Braginsky|journal=Archipel. |date= 2001 |volume= 62  |number= 1  |pages= 21–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an early date, if confirmed, may suggest that Hamzah did not live or work in Aceh, rather he was in Barus before leaving for Mecca where he died.&lt;ref name="feener"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mapping the Acehnese Past |editors=R Michael Feener, Patrick Daly, Anthony Reed |pages=31–33 |publisher= Brill |date=January 1, 2011|isbn= 978-9067183659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Panentheism==
Hamzah Fansuri's panentheism was derived from the writings of the [[medieval]] [[Islam]]ic [[scholar]]s. He was influenced by [[Ibn Arabi]]'s doctrine of ''[[Sufi metaphysics|Waḥdat al-Wujūd]]'' popular in Persia and Mughal India during the 16th century.&lt;ref name="ooi"/&gt; He perceived [[God]] as immanent within all things, including the individual, and sought to unite one's [[soul|self]] with the indwelling spirit of God. He employed the doctrine of seven stages of emanation (''martabat'') in which God manifests Himself in this world, ending in the Perfect Man, a doctrine widespread in Indonesia at the time. His teachings were promoted by Aceh theologian Shamsuddin al-Sumatrani. 

However, his views were later deemed heretical by [[Nuruddin ar-Raniri]] for not conforming to the Islamic belief that God remained unchanged by His creation.&lt;ref&gt; M.C. Ricklefs. ''A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1300'', 2nd ed. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1994. p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Nuruddin travelled to Aceh and under his influence, the Sultana [[Taj ul-Alam]] attempted to eradicate Hamzah's works and name, and his writings were burnt.&lt;ref name="ooi"/&gt;

== Works ==
The poetry, ''[[syair]]'' or ''[[ruba'i]]'', of Hamzah Fansuri are usually not more than 13-15 stanzas, but some may be up to 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3pbwgOLcwTYC&amp;pg=PA383&amp;lpg=PA383#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Classical Traditions and Modern Meanings |editors= Stefan Sperl, Christopher Shackle |page=383 |publisher=Brill Academic Publishing|date=1996 |isbn=978-9004102958 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 32 of his poems have survived, and Hamzah included in each poem his name and information about himself in the last stanza (''takhallus bait'').  Scholars have commented on his technical skill and mastery in his rhymes, the effective blending Arabic words into Malay poetic structure. They also noted a fondness for pun in his works that displays his humour and poetical virtuosity.&lt;ref name="drewes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=HAMZA PANSURI: Notes on: Yoga Practies, Lahir dan Zahir, the 'Taxallos', Punning, a Difficult Passage in the Kitāb al-Muntahī, Hamza's likely Place of Birth, and Hamza's Imagery |author=L.F. Brakel|journal=Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society|volume= 52|issue= 1:235 |date=1979|page= 73–98 |jstor=41492842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote prose, and his three surviving works in prose are:
* ''Sharab al-'ashiqin'' ("The Lovers' Beverage")
* ''Asrar al-'arifin'' ("The Secrets of the Gnostics")
* ''[[Kitab]] al-Muntahi'' ("The Adept") – a collection of Arabic and Persian quotations with discussions in Malay.
He was the first to write about the Sufi doctrines in the Malay language, or indeed any other languages of the Malay archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_mysticism_of_Hamzah_Fansuri_by_Syed.html?id=BSAnnQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |author=Syed Muhammad Naguib Al-Attas|title= The Mysticism of Hamzah Fansuri |publisher=University of Malaya Press |date=1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everly page 199"&gt;''A clinical guide to the treatment of human stress response'' by George S. Everly, Jeffrey M. Lating 2002 {{ISBN|0-306-46620-1}} page 199&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity==
{{further|Axial Age}}
[[File:BuddhaTriadAndKushanCouple.JPG|thumb|200px|Buddha sitting  [[Lotus position]] with hand [[mudras]], 3rd century.]]
Some of the earliest written records of meditation ([[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]]), come from the Hindu traditions of [[Advaita Vedanta|Vedantism]] around 1500 BCE.&lt;ref name="George S. Everly page 199"/&gt; The [[Vedas]] discuss the meditative traditions of [[ancient India]].&lt;ref name="George S. Everly page 199"/&gt; Around the 6th to 5th centuries BCE, other forms of meditation developed in [[Taoist]] China and [[early Buddhism|Buddhist]] India. [[Dhyana in Buddhism|Dhyana]] in [[early Buddhism]] also takes influence on Vedanta by ca. the 4th century BCE.&lt;ref name="George S. Everly page 199"/&gt; 

The exact origins of [[Buddhist]] meditation are subject to debate among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;''The origin of Buddhist meditation'' by Alexander Wynne 2007 {{ISBN|0-415-42387-2}} page 4&lt;/ref&gt; Early written records of the multiple levels and states of meditation in [[Buddhism]] in [[India]] are found in the [[sutra]]s of the [[Pāli Canon]], which dates to 1st century BCE.
The Pali Canon records the basic fourfold formula of salvation via the observance of the rules of morality, contemplative concentration, knowledge and liberation, thus placing meditation as a step along the path of salvation.&lt;ref&gt;''Zen Buddhism : a History: India and China'' by Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter 2005 {{ISBN|0-941532-89-5}} pages 15&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Buddhism was spreading in China, the [[Vimalakirti Sutra]] which dates to 100CE included a number of passages on meditation and enlightened wisdom, clearly pointing to [[Zen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Zen Buddhism : a History: India and China'' by Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter 2005 {{ISBN|0-941532-89-5}} pages 50&lt;/ref&gt;

In the west, by 20 BCE [[Philo of Alexandria]] had written on some form of "spiritual exercises" involving attention (prosoche) and concentration&lt;ref&gt;Hadot, Pierre; Arnold I. Davidson (1995) ''Philosophy as a way of life'' {{ISBN|0-631-18033-8}} pages 83-84&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 3rd century [[Plotinus]] had developed meditative techniques, which however did not attract a following among Christian meditators. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] experimented with the methods of Plotinus and failed to achieve ecstasy.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Urs von Balthasar, ''Christian meditation'' Ignatius Press {{ISBN|0-89870-235-6}} page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism]] introduced meditation to other oriental countries. [[Bodhidharma]] is traditionally considered the transmitter of the concept of [[Zen]] to China. However, the first "original school" in East Asia was founded by his contemporary [[Zhiyi]] in the 6th century in central China. Zhiyi managed to systematically organize the various teachings that had been imported from India in a way that their relationship with each other made sense.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sutra of perfect enlightenment: Korean Buddhism's guide to meditation'' by A. Charles Muller, 1999 {{ISBN|0-7914-4101-6}} page 5&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wonhyo]] and [[Uisang]] promoted [[Korean Buddhism]] in the 7th century.

There is evidence that [[Judaism]] has inherited meditative practices from its predecessor traditions{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} in [[Origins_of_Judaism#Monarchy|Israelite antiquity]]. For instance, in the [[Torah]], the patriarch [[Isaac]] is described as going "lasuach" in the field - a term understood by most commentators as some type of meditative practice ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 24:63). There are indications throughout the [[Tanakh]] (the Hebrew [[Bible]]) that Judaism always contained a central meditative tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Kaplan |first = Aryeh |authorlink = Aryeh Kaplan |title = Jewish Meditation |publisher = Schocken Books |year = 1985 |location = New York |pages = 40–41 |isbn = 0-8052-1037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
With the growth of [[Japanese Buddhism]] from the 8th century onwards, meditative practices were brought to and further developed in Japan. The Japanese monk Dosho learned of Zen during his visit to China in 653 and upon his return opened the first meditation hall in Japan, at [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]].&lt;ref&gt;''Zen Buddhism : a History: Japan'' by Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter 2005 {{ISBN|0-941532-90-9}} page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Meditative practices continued to arrive in Japan from China, and were subjected to modification. When [[Dōgen]] returned to Japan from China around 1227, he wrote the instructions for [[Zazen]], or sitting meditation, and conceived of a community of monks primarily focused on Zazen.&lt;ref&gt;''Soto Zen in Medieval Japan'' by [[William Bodiford]] 2008 {{ISBN|0-8248-3303-1}} page 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of Japan: Medieval Japan'' by Kōzō Yamamura, John Whitney Hall 1990 {{ISBN|0-521-22354-7}}, p. 646&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Indischer Maler um 1630 001.jpg|thumb|left|160px|A [[Sufism|Sufi]] saint in [[Muraqaba|Muraqaba meditation]], c. 1630.]]
Early practices of [[Jewish meditation]] grew and changed by the Middle Ages.  Jewish meditation practices that developed included meditative approaches to prayer, [[mizvot]] and study.  Some forms of meditation involved [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] practices, and some involved approaches of [[Jewish philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Brill, Dwelling with Kabbalah: Meditation, Ritual, and Study in Jewish Spirituality and Divine Law by Adam Mintz, Lawrence H. Schiffman 2005 {{ISBN|0-88125-865-2}} page 146&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muraqaba|Sufi view]] or Islamic mysticism involves meditative practices. Remembrance of God in Islam, which is known by the concept [[Dhikr]] is interpreted in different meditative techniques in [[Sufism]] or Islamic mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;''Prayer: a history'' by Philip Zaleski, Carol Zaleski 2005 {{ISBN|0-618-15288-1}} page 147-149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Global Encyclopaedia of Education'' by Rama Sankar Yadav &amp; B.N. Mandal 2007 {{ISBN|978-81-8220-227-6}} page 63&lt;/ref&gt; This became one of the essential elements of Sufism as it was systematized in the 11th and 12th centuries. It is juxtaposed with ''fikr'' (thinking) which leads to knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''Sainthood and revelatory discourse'' by David Emmanuel Singh 2003 {{ISBN|81-7214-728-7}} page 154&lt;/ref&gt; By the 12th century, the practice of Sufism included specific meditative techniques, and its followers practiced breathing controls and the repetition of holy words.&lt;ref&gt;''Spiritual Psychology'' by Akbar Husain 2006 {{ISBN|81-8220-095-4}} page 109&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eastern Christian]] meditation can involve the repetition of a phrase in a specific physical posture, and can be traced back to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period. Between the 10th and 14th centuries,  [[hesychasm]] was developed, particularly on [[Mount Athos]] in Greece, and continues to the present. It involves the repetition of the [[Jesus prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/Athos/General/AthosHistory.html |title=Mount Athos: History |work=Macedonian Heritage |accessdate=12 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207062434/http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/Athos/General/AthosHistory.html |archivedate=7 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that there were interactions between Hesychasts and the Indians or the [[Sufis]], but this can not be proven.&lt;ref&gt;''An introduction to the Christian Orthodox churches'' by John Binns 2002 {{ISBN|0-521-66738-0}} page 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxwiki.org/Hesychasm|title=Hesychasm|work=OrthodoxWiki|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Western Christian|Western]] [[Christian meditation]] contrasts with most other approaches in that it does not involve the repetition of any phrase or action and requires no specific posture. Western [[Christian meditation]] progressed from the 6th century practice of Bible reading among [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monks called [[Lectio Divina]], i.e. divine reading. Its four formal steps as a "ladder" were defined by the monk [[Guigo II]] in the 12th century with the Latin terms ''lectio'', ''meditatio'', ''oratio'', and ''contemplatio'' (i.e. read, ponder, pray, contemplate). Western [[Christian meditation]] was further developed by saints such as [[Ignatius of Loyola]] and [[Teresa of Avila]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Spirituality: A Historical Sketch'' by George Lane 2005 {{ISBN|0-8294-2081-9}} page 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition'' by Lawrence S. Cunningham, Keith J. Egan 1996 {{ISBN|0-8091-3660-0}} page 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Oblate Life'' by Gervase Holdaway, 2008 {{ISBN|0-8146-3176-2}} page 109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''After Augustine: the meditative reader and the text'' by [[Brian Stock (historian)|Brian Stock]] 2001 {{ISBN|0-8122-3602-5}} page 105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern history==
By the 18th century, the study of [[Buddhism in the West]] was a topic for intellectuals. The philosopher [[Schopenhauer]] discussed it,&lt;ref&gt;Abelson, Peter (April 1993) [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm Schopenhauer and Buddhism]. ''Philosophy East and West Volume 43, Number 2,'' pp. 255-278. University of Hawaii Press. Retrieved on: 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Voltaire]] asked for toleration towards Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;''Enlightenment and reform in 18th-century Europe'' by Derek Edward Dawson Beales 2005 {{ISBN|1-86064-949-1}} page 13&lt;/ref&gt; The first English translation of the ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead]]'' was published in 1927.&lt;ref name="Shakya"&gt;Shakya, Tsering "Review of ''Prisoners of Shangri-la'' by Donald Lopez". [http://www.buddhistethics.org/6/shakya991.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

New [[list of yoga schools|schools of yoga]] developed in [[Hindu revivalism]] from the 1890s.
Some of these schools were introduced to the west, by [[Vivekananda]] and later gurus.
Other schools were designed as secularized variants of yoga traditions for use by non-Hindus, e.g. the system of [[Transcendental Meditation]] popular in the 1960s, and numerous forms of [[Hatha Yoga]] derived from the [[Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga]] school, which became known simply as "[[Yoga (exercise)|Yoga]]" in western terminology.

Rather than focusing on spiritual growth, secular meditation emphasizes stress reduction, relaxation and self-improvement.&lt;ref&gt;''A clinical guide to the treatment of human stress response'' by George S. Everly, Jeffrey M. Lating 2002 {{ISBN|0-306-46620-1}} page 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion'' by David A. Leeming, Kathryn Madden, Stanton Marlan 2009 ISBN page 559&lt;/ref&gt; Both spiritual and secular forms of meditation have been subjects of [[Research on meditation|scientific analyses and research]]. However, after 60 years of scientific study, the exact mechanism at work in meditation remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;''A clinical guide to the treatment of human stress response'' by George S. Everly, Jeffrey M. Lating 2002 {{ISBN|0-306-46620-1}} pages 201-202&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jewish Buddhist|'Jubu' (Jewish Buddhist)]] group are a very articulate current influence on meditation thinking in the West.

==History of defining meditation==

In 1971, [[Claudio Naranjo]] noted that ''"The word 'meditation' has been used to designate a variety of practices that differ enough from one another so that we may find trouble in defining what ''meditation'' is."&lt;ref name=naranjo72&gt;Claudio Naranjo (1972, originally published 1971), in: Naranjo and Orenstein, ''On the Psychology of Meditation''. New York: Viking.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} There remains no definition of necessary and sufficient criteria for meditation that has achieved universal or widespread acceptance within the modern scientific community, as one study recently noted a "persistent lack of consensus in the literature" and a "seeming intractability of defining meditation"''.&lt;ref name="bond09"&gt;{{Cite journal |year=2009 |title=Defining a complex intervention: The development of demarcation criteria for "meditation" |journal=[[Psychology of Religion and Spirituality]]|volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=129–137 |doi=10.1037/a0015736 |author1=Kenneth Bond |author2=Maria B.

'''John McTaggart Ellis McTaggart''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|k|ˈ|t|æ|g|ər|t}}; 3 September 1866 – 18 January 1925), was an [[Idealism|idealist]] [[metaphysics|metaphysician]]. For most of his life McTaggart was a fellow and lecturer in philosophy at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He was an exponent of the philosophy of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and among the most notable of the [[British Idealism|British idealists]]. McTaggart is known for "[[The Unreality of Time]]" (1908), in which he argues that [[time]] is unreal. The work has been widely discussed through the 20th Century and into the 21st.

==Personal life==
McTaggart was born in 1866 in London to Francis and Ellen Ellis. At birth, he was named '''John McTaggart Ellis''', after his maternal grand-uncle, John McTaggart. Early in his life, his family took the surname McTaggart as a condition of inheritance from that same uncle.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Cambridge Philosophers III: McTaggart |first=Peter |last=Geach |authorlink=Peter Geach |journal=Philosophy |volume=70 |issue=274 |date=October 1995 |pages= 567–579 |publisher=Published by: Cambridge University Press on behalf of Royal Institute of Philosophy |jstor=3751084 |doi=10.1017/s0031819100065815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McTaggart attended [[Clifton College]], Bristol, before going up to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MTGT885JM|name=McTaggart, John McTaggart Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]] he was taught for the Moral Sciences [[Tripos]] by [[Henry Sidgwick]] and [[James Ward (psychologist)|James Ward]], both distinguished [[philosophers]]. After obtaining First class honours (the only student of Moral Sciences to do so in 1888), he was, in 1891, elected to a prize fellowship at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]] on the basis of a dissertation on [[Georg Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''[[Science of Logic|Logic]]''. McTaggart had in the meantime been President of the [[Cambridge Union Society|Union Society]], a debating club, and a member of the secretive [[Cambridge Apostles]] society.  In 1897 he was appointed to a college lectureship in Philosophy, a position he would hold until his retirement in 1923 (although he continued to lecture until his death). He received the honorary degree ''[[Doctor of Letters]]'' (D.Litt.) from the university in May 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=28 May 1902 |page_number=12 |issue=36779| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McTaggart, although radical in his youth, became increasingly conservative and was influential in the expulsion of [[Bertrand Russell]] from [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]] for [[pacifism]] during [[World War I]]. But McTaggart was a man of contradictions: despite his conservatism he was an advocate of [[women's suffrage]], and though an [[atheism|atheist]] from his youth was a firm believer in [[immortality|human immortality]] and a defender of the [[Church of England]]. He was personally charming and had interests ranging beyond philosophy, known for his encyclopaedic knowledge of English novels and eighteenth-century memoirs.

His honours included an honorary [[LL.D.]] from the [[University of St. Andrews]] and Fellowship of the [[British Academy]].

He died in London in 1925. In 1899 he had married Margaret Elizabeth Bird in [[New Zealand]] whom he met while visiting his mother (then living near [[New Plymouth]], [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]]) and was survived by her; the couple had no children.

==Hegel scholarship==
McTaggart's earlier work was devoted to an exposition and critique of Hegel's [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] methods and conclusions and their application in other fields. His first published work ''Studies in Hegelian Dialectic'' (1896), an expanded version of his Trinity fellowship dissertation, focused on the [[dialectics|dialectical method]] of Hegel's ''[[Science of Logic|Logic]]''. His second work ''Studies in Hegelian Cosmology'' (1901) is directed more towards a critique of the applications of [[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] ideas made, both by Hegel and earlier [[Neo-Hegelianism|neo-Hegelians]], to the fields of ethics, politics and religion. In this book a number of his distinctive doctrines already appear, for example, his belief in [[immortality|human immortality]]. His final book specifically on Hegel was ''A Commentary on Hegel's [[Science of Logic|"Logic"]]'' (1910), in which he attempted to explain and, to an extent, defend the argument of the [[Science of Logic|Logic]].

Although he defended the [[dialectics|dialectical method]] broadly construed and shared a similar outlook to Hegel, McTaggart's Hegelianism was not uncritical and he disagreed significantly both with Hegel himself and with earlier [[Neo-Hegelianism|neo-Hegelians]]. He believed that many specific features of Hegel's argument were gravely flawed and was similarly disparaging of Hegel's application of his abstract thought. However, he by no means reached the same conclusions as the previous generations of [[British Idealism|British Idealists]] and in his later work came to hold strikingly different and original views. Nonetheless, in spite of his break from earlier forms of Hegelianism, McTaggart inherited from his predecessors a pivotal belief in the ability of ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' thought to grasp the nature of the ultimate reality, which for him like earlier Hegelians was the [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute idea]]. Indeed, his later work and mature system can be seen as largely an attempt to give substance to his new conception of the [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute]].

==McTaggart's Paradox==
McTaggart is best known today for his attempt to prove that our concept of time involves a contradiction, and that therefore reality cannot be temporal. It follows that our perception of time is an illusion, and that time itself is merely [[Platonic ideal|ideal]]. His argument for this point is popularly known as McTaggart's Paradox. The argument first appeared in the form of a journal article called "[[The Unreality of Time]]" (1908), but reappeared later as Chapter 33, 'Time', in the posthumously published Second Volume of his masterpiece ''The Nature of Existence'', published in 1927. He introduced the notions of the [[A-series and B-series|"A series" and "B series"]], representing two different ways that events appear to have a position in time. The A series corresponds to our everyday notions of ''[[past]]'', ''present'', and ''[[future]]''. The A series is "the series of positions running from the far past through the near past to the present, and then from the present to the near future and the far future" (p.&amp;nbsp;458). This is contrasted with the B series, in which positions are ordered from earlier-than to later-than relations. Thus the A series represent the events in time in a moving relation (from future to present to past) to the temporally moving observer, whereas the B series orders the time events as in firm and fixed relations to other time events.

McTaggart argued that the A series was a necessary component of any full theory of time since change only occurs in the A series, but that it was also [[contradiction|self-contradictory]] and that our perception of time was, therefore, ultimately an incoherent illusion.

===The necessity of the A series===
The first, and longer, part of McTaggart's argument is his affirmative answer to the question "whether it is essential to the reality of time that its events should form an A series as well as a B series" (p.&amp;nbsp;458). Broadly, McTaggart argues that if events are not ordered by an A as well as a B series then there cannot be said to be change. At the centre of his argument is the example of the death of Queen Anne. This event is a death, it has certain causes and certain effects, it is later than the death of Queen Elizabeth etc., but none of these properties change over time. Only in one respect does the event change:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It began by being a future event. It became every moment an event in the nearer future. At last it was a present event. Then it became past, and will always remain so, though every moment it becomes further and further past.
Thus we seem forced to the conclusion that all change is only a change in the characteristics imparted to events by their presence in the A series" (p. 460).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Despite its power and originality this half of McTaggart's argument has, historically, received less attention than the second half.

===The incoherence of the A series===
McTaggart's attempted proof of the incoherence of the A series (the argument of pages 468–9) appears in the original paper only as a single part of a broader argument for this conclusion. According to the argument, the contradiction in our perception of time is that all events exemplify all three of the properties of the A-series, viz. being past, present and future. As McTaggart himself notes, the obvious response is that while exemplifying all three properties at some time, no event exemplifies all three ''at once'', no event ''is'' past, present, and future. A single event ''is'' present, ''will have been'' future, ''will be'' past, and here there is, it seems, no contradiction. However, McTaggart argues that this response gives rise to a [[vicious circle]] and [[infinite regress]]. There is a vicious circle because the response requires us to invoke the A-series determinations of future, present, and past to explain how the events of the series do not exemplify those determinations simultaneously but successively. And there is a vicious regress because invoking tense to explain how different tenses are exemplified successively, gives rise to second order tenses that again are incompatible unless we again invoke tense to show how they are exemplified successively, ''etcetera ad infinitum''. It bears to mention that in the mature version of the argument McTaggart has given up the claim that there is a vicious circle, but only a vicious regress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=McTaggart's Paradox|last=Ingthorsson|first=R. D.|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781138677241|location=New York|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One can convey the basic idea of the vicious regress in the following way. In order to avoid the initial apparent contradiction that events have incompatible tenses, one has to construe "a second A series, within which the first falls, in the same way in which events fall within the first" (p.&amp;nbsp;469). But even if the idea of a second A series within which the first falls makes sense (and McTaggart doubts it does, p.&amp;nbsp;469), it will face the same contradiction. And so, we must construct a third A series within which the second falls. And this will require the construction of a fourth A series and so on ''ad infinitum''. At any given stage the contradiction will appear; however far we go in constructing A series, each A series will be, without reference to a further A series containing it, contradictory. One ought to conclude, McTaggart argues, that the A series is indeed contradictory and, therefore, does not exist.

Whether McTaggart's argument for the incoherence of the A series works or not, is one of the most hotly debated issues in the philosophy of time (see the entry for "[[The Unreality of Time]]" for a more thorough discussion).

==Mature system: ''The Nature of Existence''==
In his later work, particularly his two-volume ''The Nature of Existence'', McTaggart developed his own, highly original, metaphysical system. The most famous element is his defence of [[The Unreality of Time]], but McTaggart's system was much broader. In ''The Nature of Existence'' McTaggart defended a similar Hegelian view of the universe to that of his earlier work on the basis not of Hegel's [[dialectics]] but rather in the mode of more modern [[metaphysics]].

McTaggart concluded the world was composed of nothing but [[soul]]s, each soul related to one or more of the others by love. He argued against belief in God since he denied the [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] any single personality (thereby justifying his [[atheism]]). His philosophy, however, was fundamentally optimistic. McTaggart believed each of the souls (which are identified with human beings) to be [[immortality|immortal]] and defended the idea of [[reincarnation]]. McTaggart held the view that all selves are unoriginated and indestructible.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Robert L. (1975). ''The Case for Immortality''. International Journal for Philosophy of Religion. Vol. 6, No. 2. pp. 89-101.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Nature of Existence'' also seeks to synthesise McTaggart's denial of the existence of time, matter etc. with their apparent existence.

Despite the [[mysticism|mystical]] tone of its conclusions, the philosophical method of ''The Nature of Existence'' is far from mystical. McTaggart arrived at his conclusions by a careful analysis of the essential requirements of any successful metaphysical system (Volume I) followed by a purported proof that only his system satisfies these requirements (Volume II). The logical rigour of his system is in evidence, for example, in McTaggart's famous attempted proof of the unreality of time.

==Influence==
McTaggart was a friend and teacher of [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[G. E. Moore]], and, according to [[Norbert Wiener]]&lt;ref&gt;N. Wiener. Ex-Prodigy: My Childhood and Youth. MIT Press, 1953, Ch. XIV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Annotated Alice]]: ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland &amp; Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll'' by [[Martin Gardner]]. New York, Bramhall House, 1960, comment to Ch. VII of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland''.&lt;/ref&gt;, the three were known as "[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|The Mad Tea-Party]] of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]]" (with McTaggart as the Dormouse). Along with Russell and [[G.E. Moore|Moore]], McTaggart was a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles]] through which he would have a personal influence on an entire generation of writers and politicians (his involvement with the Apostles presumably overlapped with that of, among others, the members of the [[Bloomsbury group]]) .

In particular, McTaggart was an early influence on Bertrand Russell. It was through McTaggart that the young Russell was converted to the prevalent Hegelianism of the day, and it was Russell's reaction against this Hegelianism that began the arc of his later work.

McTaggart was the most influential advocate of [[Neo-Hegelianism|neo-Hegelian]] [[idealism]] in Cambridge at the time of Russell and [[G.E. Moore|Moore's]] reaction against it, as well as being a teacher and personal acquaintance of both men. With [[F.H. Bradley]] of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] he was, as the most prominent of the surviving British Idealists, the primary target of the [[Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|new realists']] assault. McTaggart's indirect influence was, therefore, very great. Given that modern [[analytic philosophy]] can arguably be traced to the work of Russell and [[G.E. Moore|Moore]] in this period, McTaggart's work retains interest to the historian of [[analytic philosophy]] despite being, in a very real sense, the product of an earlier age.

''The Nature of Existence'', with [[T.H. Green|Green's]] ''Prolegomena to Ethics'' and [[F.H. Bradley|Bradley's]] ''[[Appearance and Reality]]'', marks the greatest achievement of British Idealism, and McTaggart was the last major British Idealist of the classic period (for the later development of British Idealism, see [[T.L.S. Sprigge]]).

'''Jacques Rancière''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁɑ̃sjɛʁ|lang}}; born 1940) is a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]], Professor of Philosophy at [[European Graduate School]] in [[Saas-Fee]]  and Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Paris VIII: Vincennes—Saint-Denis]] who came to prominence when he co-authored ''[[Reading Capital]]'' (1968), with the [[Structural Marxism|structuralist Marxist]] philosopher [[Louis Althusser]].&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jacques-ranciere/biography/ Jacques Rancière Faculty Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417061517/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jacques-ranciere/biography/ |date=2010-04-17 }} at [[European Graduate School]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Rancière contributed to the influential volume ''[[Reading Capital]]'' before publicly breaking with Althusser over his attitude toward the May 1968 [[French May|student uprising in Paris]]; Rancière felt Althusser's theoretical stance did not leave enough room for spontaneous popular uprising.&lt;ref name="rancieredavis"&gt;Ben Davis. [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/books/davis/davis8-17-06.asp Rancière, For Dummies.] The Politics of Aesthetics. Book Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Rancière has departed from the path set by his teacher and published a series of works probing the concepts that make up our understanding of political discourse, such as [[ideology]] and [[proletariat]]. He sought to address whether the working class in fact exists, and how the masses of workers that thinkers like Althusser referred to continuously enter into a relationship with [[knowledge]], particularly the limits of philosophers' knowledge with respect to the proletariat. An example of this line of thinking is Rancière's book entitled ''Le philosophe et ses pauvres'' (''The Philosopher and His Poor'', 1983), a book about the role of the poor in the intellectual lives of philosophers.

More recently Rancière has written on the topic of human rights and specifically the role of international human rights organizations in asserting the authority to determine which groups of people, again the problem of masses, justify [[human rights]] interventions and even war.

Rancière's book, ''[[The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation]]'' (original title ''Le Maître ignorant: Cinq leçons sur l'émancipation intellectuelle'', published in 1987) was written for educators and educators-to-be.  Through the story of [[Joseph Jacotot]], Rancière challenges his readers to consider equality as a starting point rather than a destination.  In doing so, he asks educators to abandon the themes and rhetoric of cultural deficiency and salvation. Rather than requiring informed schoolmasters to guide students towards prescribed and alienating ends, Rancière argues that educators can channel the equal intelligence in all to facilitate their intellectual growth in virtually unlimited directions. The schoolmaster need not know anything (and may be ignorant). Rancière begins with the premises that all are of equal intelligence and that any collective educational exercise founded on this principle can provide the insights from which knowledge is constructed. He claims that the poor and disenfranchised should feel perfectly able to teach ''themselves'' whatever it is they want to know. Furthermore, anyone can lead, and the oppressed should not feel bound to experts or reliant on others for their intellectual emancipation.

Jacotot advocated the 'equality of intelligence' and claimed that an ignorant person could teach another ignorant person. Rancière developed this idea in ''The Ignorant Schoolmaster'', saying that “there is stultification whenever one intelligence is subordinated to another ... whoever teaches without emancipating stultifies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation]]|author=Jacques Ranciere |pages=13, 18|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Epistemologies of Ignorance in Education |author=Molly Quinn |chapter=Committing (to) Ignorance |pages=31–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
In 2006, it was reported that Rancière's [[aesthetic]] theory had become a point of reference in the [[visual arts]], and Rancière has lectured at such art world events as the Frieze Art Fair.&lt;ref name="rancieredavis"/&gt; Former French presidential candidate [[Ségolène Royal]] described Rancière as her favourite philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Translation: Jacques Rancière, the philosopher who inspires Ségolène Royal|url=http://www.ufppc.org/us-a-world-news-mainmenu-35/5508-translation-sl-royals-favorite-philosopher.html|work=United for Peace of Pierce County, WA|publisher=[[Paris Match]]|accessdate=9 December 2013|author=Patrice Bollon|author2=Mark K. Jensen|page=34|date=December 2006|quote=Scoop: we've found out where the Socialist candidate got her ideas! From this intellectual sensitive to political alienation. Jacques Rancière.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those intellectuals influenced by his work, [[Gabriel Rockhill]] has developed a new paradigm for thinking the historical relation between aesthetics and politics in close dialogue with Rancière's writings.

'''Jamil Sidqi al-Zahawi''' (17 June 1863 – January 1936) ({{lang-ar|'''جميل صدقي الزهاوي'''}}, {{transl|ar|'''Jamīl Sidqī al-Zahāwī'''}}) was a prominent [[Iraq]]i [[Arabic poetry|poet]] and [[philosopher]]. He is regarded as one of the greatest contemporary poets of the [[Arab world]] and was known for his defence of [[women's rights]].

==Biography== 

Zahawi was born on 18 June, 1863 in [[Baghdad]]. His father, of [[Iraqi Kurd]] origin, was the [[Mufti]] of Iraq and a member of the scholarly [[Baban]] clan; a powerful and prominent family in Kurdish Iraq.His mother was a [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen]]. His parents separated soon after the children were born and the children's mother returned to her family, taking her children with her. His father, who was partial to Jamil's intelligence and quick temper, decided to raise the boy himself. His father taught him poetry from a very young age and encouraged him to develop an inquisitive mind.&lt;ref&gt;Badawī, M. M., ''A Critical Introduction to Modern Arabic Poetry'', Cambridge University Press, 1975, p. 45; Na Na, ''Autobiography and the Construction of Identity and Community in the Middle East'', Springer, 2016. pp 111-112&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was raised in Bagdad, where he was initially educated in ''kuttab'' (Q'ranic school). He did not receive a formal education; instead his father engaged private tutors to teach him science, rhetoric and grammar. He may have gained some formal education in jurisprudence, logic, astronomy and exegesis, although details are sketchy. However, it is clear that he was mostly self-taught, using books, especially translations of European works on science and philosophy. Through his father, he participated in Baghdad's literary society by attending ''majalis'' (social gatherings of the literary elite) for discussions of various topics. The informal nature of his education combined with his early exposure to debating societies, contributed to his love of debate and his inquisitive attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Na Na, ''Autobiography and the Construction of Identity and Community in the Middle East'', Springer, 2016. pp 112-113&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1896, he was invited to Istanbul. Between 1896 and 1898, he based himself in Istanbul but also travelled to [[Yemen]] on an Imperial decree, as part of a delegation to carry out reforms. In Istanbul, he was appointed Professor of Islamic Studies at the Malakki School and Professor of Arabic Literature at the [[Istanbul University|University of Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;Khoury D.R., "Looking for the Modern: A Biography of an Iraqi Modernist", in: Fay M.A. (ed), ''Auto/Biography and the Construction of Identity and Community in the Middle East'',  New York, Palgrave Macmillan, pp 109-124, DOI:10.1007/978-1-349-62114-9_8&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period, he came into contact with the Turkish literary society and was exposed to those Turkish poets who were experimenting with modern poetry and seeking to liberate their work from the constraints of meter and rhyme. He also had the opportunity to read Arabic translations of works by Shakespeare and Western poetry. These encounters exposed him to new ideas about modern poetry and its role in political debate, and would subsequently inform his work in terms of both its form and the choice of subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Moreh, S., ''Modern Arabic Poetry: 1800 - 1970; the Development of Its Forms and Themes Under the Influence of Western Literature'', Brill, 1976, pp 136-137; Na Na, ''Autobiography and the Construction of Identity and Community in the Middle East'', Springer, 2016. pp 117-118&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Baghdad briefly, but he was exiled for his outspoken views, by the despotic [[Abdul Hamid II|Hamidi regime]] and forced to return to Istanbul in around 1908.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in Iraq'', 1936, p. 587&lt;/ref&gt; In Istanbul, he worked for the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP), also known as the Young Turks, where he met with prominent members of the Union movement. He became highly politicised by the relationships formed at this time and remained committed to social reform througout his life. To this end, he regularly contributed regular articles to various publications in Iraq and in Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;Moreh, S., ''Modern Arabic Poetry: 1800 - 1970; the Development of Its Forms and Themes Under the Influence of Western Literature'', Brill, 1976, pp 136-137; Na Na, ''Autobiography and the Construction of Identity and Community in the Middle East'', Springer, 2016. pp 117-118&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his return to Baghdad, he held numerous government positions: as a member of the Baghdad Education Council, where he championed education for women and as an editor of the only newspaper in Baghdad, ''al-Zawra''.&lt;ref&gt;Khoury D.R., "Looking for the Modern: A Biography of an Iraqi Modernist", in: Fay M.A. (ed), ''Auto/Biography and the Construction of Identity and Community in the Middle East'',  New York, Palgrave Macmillan, pp 109-124, DOI:10.1007/978-1-349-62114-9_8&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a Professor of law at [[University of Baghdad|Baghdad University]], but his tenure was short-lived. A controversial article on women's emancipation which exhorted women to give up the veil and called for reforms to the existing divorce laws, caused a public outcry, resulting in his home being mobbed for an entire week. In order to appease the public, al-Zahawi was dismissed from his academic position in 1910. Following this incident, he fled Iraq and resided first in Egypt and later in Turkey. &lt;ref&gt;Khoury D.R., "Looking for the Modern: A Biography of an Iraqi Modernist", in: Fay M.A. (ed), ''Auto/Biography and the Construction of Identity and Community in the Middle East'',  New York, Palgrave Macmillan, pp 109-124, DOI:10.1007/978-1-349-62114-9_8; Badawī, M. M., ''A Critical Introduction to Modern Arabic Poetry'', Cambridge University Press, 1975, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; 

His final return to Baghdad was after the [[Mandatory Iraq|British Mandate]] was formed in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Khoury D.R., "Looking for the Modern: A Biography of an Iraqi Modernist", in: Fay M.A. (ed), ''Auto/Biography and the Construction of Identity and Community in the Middle East'',  New York, Palgrave Macmillan, pp 109-124, DOI:10.1007/978-1-349-62114-9_8; Badawī, M. M., ''A Critical Introduction to Modern Arabic Poetry'', Cambridge University Press, 1975, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; After Iraq's independence in 1921, he was elected to [[Iraqi parliament|parliament]] twice and appointed to the upper chamber (1925-29).&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in Iraq'', 1936, p. 587&lt;/ref&gt; In his spare time, he could be found in Baghdad's cultural cafés, where he actively participated in arguments with poets and literary figures.&lt;ref&gt;Omar, O., "The Changing World of Baghdad’s Cultural Cafés", ''The Arab Weekly'', 3 April, 2016, [https://thearabweekly.com/changing-world-baghdads-cultural-cafes Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;  

During his career, he was a critic of the [[Wahhabism|Wahhabis]], the extremist group that was the foundation of the Saudi kingdom, and which subsequently morphed into ''Al Qaeda'' and ''Islamic State''. He described their atrocities and denounced their claims that only they were the true Muslims. He was also a champion of women's rights, criticising the wearing of the veil, the practice of older men marrying adolescent girls, forced marriage without previous acquaintance, polygamy and male privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, S., "Model for Moderate Muslims", ''The Huffington Post'', 5 December, 2015, [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-schwartz/a-model-for-moderate-musl_b_7256662.html Online:]; Noga, E., "The Other 'Awakening' in Iraq: The Women's Movement in the First Half of the Twentieth 
Century:, ''British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies'', Vol. 31, No. 2, 2004, pp 153-173&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Funeral of Jamil Sidqi al-Zahawi.jpg|thumb|left|Funeral of Jamil Sidqi al-Zahawi, 1936]]
He was one of the leading writers in the Arab world, publishing in the major newspapers and journals of [[Beirut]], [[Cairo]], and [[Baghdad]]. Describing his life in a collection of his poems, he wrote, "In my childhood I was thought of as eccentric because of my unusual gestures; in my youth, as feckless because of my ebullient nature, lack of seriousness, and excessive playfulness; in my middle age as courageous for my resistance to tyranny; and in my old age as an apostate because I propounded my philosophical views."&lt;ref&gt;Najim, Mohammed Yusif, editor. ''Diwan Jamil Sidqi alZahawi'', Vol. 1. Beirut: Dar al-Kitab al-Arabi, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He clung to his principles of simplicity in poetry and the avoidance of the artifice and false conceits that had preoccupied traditional poets. He also stressed the importance of poetry as a vehicle for social commentary. However, his work attracted literary criticism in the period following the first World War, when a wave of nationalism began to influence the arts. By this time, his forthright language and prose-like verse began to look unsophisticated and outdated. Moreover, his use of blank verse, which had always been experimental, began to look naive and clumsy. Although he lost favour with critics, he remained popular with the people because of his gifts as an orator and the accessibility of his writing.&lt;ref&gt;Na Na, ''Autobiography and the Construction of Identity and Community in the Middle East'', Springer, 2016. pp 121-122&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of his life, he was largely ostracised by the new literary elite.&lt;ref&gt;Badawī, M. M., ''A Critical Introduction to Modern Arabic Poetry'', Cambridge University Press, 1975, pp 51-52&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1930s, because of his political views, he was also marginalized by the political establishment. He was embittered by the way he was treated and cast himself as the "misunderstood poet/philosopher with a perpetually wounded ego." &lt;ref&gt;Khoury D.R., "Looking for the Modern: A Biography of an Iraqi Modernist", in: Fay M.A. (ed), ''Auto/Biography and the Construction of Identity and Community in the Middle East'',  New York, Palgrave Macmillan, pp 109-124, DOI:10.1007/978-1-349-62114-9_8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

Al-Zahawi wrote poetry in Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Kurdish. Some of his works, such as ''The True Dawn in Refuting Those Who Deny the Seeking of Intercession and the Miracles of Saints'' (1905) have been translated into English, but he himself never learned any European language.&lt;ref&gt;Moreh, S., ''Modern Arabic Poetry: 1800 - 1970; the Development of Its Forms and Themes Under the Influence of Western Literature'', Brill, 1976, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian writer [[Taha Hussein]] said of him: "Zahawi wasn't only the poet of [[Arabic language]] or the poet of [[Iraq]], he was also the poet of [[Egypt]] and of other countries... he was a poet of the mind... the [[Al-Ma`arri|Ma'arri]] of this era... but he is the Ma'arri who connected to [[Europe]] and used knowledge as a weapon."

The English writer, [[Gertrude Bell]] was present at a dinner in 1921, when al-Zahawi read an ode to [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal ibn Hussein]]. Bell writes:&lt;ref&gt;Gertrude Bell, ''Letters from Baghdad'' cited in: Muhanna, E., "What Gertrude Bell’s Letters Remind Us About the Founding of Iraq", ''The New Yorker'', 14 June, 2017, [https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/what-gertrude-bells-letters-remind-us-about-the-founding-of-iraq Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;  

{{blockquote|"al-Zahawi stood up and recited a tremendous ode in which he repeatedly alluded to Faisal as King of Iraq and everyone clapped and cheered. [al-Zahawi] stepped forward...in white robes and a black cloak and big black turban and chanted a poem of which I didn’t understand a word. It was far too long and as I say quite unintelligible but nevertheless it was wonderful."}}

He was the first Arabic poet to introduce ''sh'ir musal'' ([[blank verse]]; free of rhyme, no adherence to rhyme or composed of different rhyme) and was an enthusiastic proponent of the form arguing that it liberated poets to focus on expressing their ideas rather than being locked into searching for a rhyming word or phrase. His philosophy and style made him one of the early modern poets in the Arab world and he was lauded as such during the Ottoman era.&lt;ref&gt;Sperl, S., ''Classical Traditions and Modern Meanings'', BRILL, 1996, p.11; Moreh, S., ''Modern Arabic Poetry: 1800 - 1970; the Development of Its Forms and Themes Under the Influence of Western Literature'', Brill, 1976, pp 133-135&lt;/ref&gt; 

He also published a number of works on the subject of astronomy including: ''The Universe'', ''Gravitation and its Explanation'', ''General Repulsion and Natural and Astronomical Phenomena'', which expounded theories which were ultimately shown to be fundamentally flawed.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in Iraq'', 1936, p. 587&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jivamukti Yoga''' method is a proprietary style of yoga created by David Life and [[Sharon Gannon]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=What is Jivamukti Yoga?|url=http://www.yoga-dojo.com.au/jivamukti-yoga|journal=http://www.yoga-dojo.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jivamukti is a physical, ethical, and spiritual practice, combining a vigorous hatha yoga, vinyasa-based physical style with adherence to five central tenets: [[shastra]] (scripture), [[bhakti]] (devotion), [[ahimsa|ahims]][[Nada yoga|ā]] ([[nonviolence]], non-harming), [[Nada yoga|nāda]] (music), and [[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]] (meditation).

==History==
[[Image:Jivamukti-0781.jpg|thumb|200px|right|David Life and Sharon Gannon, co-founders of Jivamukti Yoga]]
Jivamukti Yoga was co-founded in New York in 1984 by dancer and musician [[Sharon Gannon]] and her partner, artist and cafe owner David Life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Jivamukti Yoga|url=http://www.yogahaven.co.uk/richmond/yoga/jivamukti-yoga/|journal=http://www.yogahaven.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gannon and Life met in 1982 in Manhattan. In 1986 they traveled together to India and took the [[Sivananda]] teacher training program and met Swami Nirmalananda. Upon their return, they opened the first Jivamukti Yoga Society in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] of [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Meet the Innovators: Sharon Gannon &amp; David Life|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/article/lifestyle/meet-the-innovators-sharon-gannon-david-life/|journal=http://www.yogajournal.com|date = 28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 they began to practice [[Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga|Ashtanga Yoga]] with [[Pattabhi Jois]] in [[Mysore, India]]. In 1993, in upstate New York, they met yoga scholar and ashram founder Shri Brahmananda Sarasvati. In 1998, the yoga center moved to [[Lafayette Street (Manhattan)|Lafayette Street]], and in 2000, Jivamukti opened a second center on the [[Upper East Side]].&lt;ref name="ascent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yogajournal"/&gt; In 2003, senior Jivamukti students Patrick Broome and Gabriela Bozic opened Jivamukti Munich, the first Jivamukti Yoga Center outside of New York City. In 2006, the Jivamukti Yoga School NYC relocated their main headquarters to an environmentally constructed studio in [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]].

The name ''Jivamukti'' is an adaptation of the [[Sanskrit]] ''jivanmuktih'', wherein ''[[jiva]]'' is the individual living soul, and ''mukti'' – like ''[[moksa]]'' – is liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth. Thus the Jivamukti method is "liberation while living".&lt;ref name="gannon"&gt;Sharon Gannon and David Life, ''Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul'', New York: Ballantine Books, 2002, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main tenets==
There are five main tenets of the Jivamukti method. These are:

===Shastra===
[[Shastra]], or scripture, refers to the study and exploration of the four central texts of yoga as well as to the study of the [[Sanskrit]] language in which they were first written. The four texts are the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'', the ''[[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]]'', the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', and the [[Upanishads]].

===Bhakti===
[[Bhakti]], literally "devotion to God", is the practice of devotion and humility. Jivamukti Yoga holds that "God-realization" is the goal of yoga practice, and that it does not matter to what form of God one's love and devotion is directed; what matters is that the devotion should be directed to something higher than one's own self or ego. Inter-religious understanding and tolerance are significant corollaries to this practice, and altars in Jivamukti centers are typically adorned with images of multiple religious and moral authorities: [[Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King]] and [[Ingrid Newkirk]] intermingle with [[Jesus]], [[Buddha]], and [[Krishna]].

===Ahimsa===
[[Ahimsa]] is the practice of nonviolence, or non-harming. Ahimsa is informed by compassion, and is defined in ''[[Yamas#Five yamas of Patañjali|Patanjali's Yoga Sutra]]'' as the first of five [[yamas]]. Yamas define the measure of how the yogi relates to other people and to the external world. The Jivamukti method teaches that the practice of ahimsa extends not only to other humans but to all animal life and advocates [[Vegetarianism#Ethics and diet|ethical vegetarianism]] both as a means of resolving human karma and as an environmental imperative for the future health of the planet.&lt;ref name=jivamuktisweden/&gt; The Jivamukti method further teaches that the practice of ahimsa includes promoting and providing educational information about animal rights, environmental concerns, and the need to take social/political action.&lt;ref name="JivamuktiNYC"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Jivamukti Yoga |url=http://www.jivamuktiyoga.com/fms/centr_fm.html |publisher=Jivamukti Yoga School |accessdate=9 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001182933/http://www.jivamuktiyoga.com/fms/centr_fm.html |archivedate= 1 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nāda===
[[Nada yoga|Nāda yoga]] centers on deep inner listening, chanting, and elevated music. Its theoretical and practical aspects are based on the premise that everything that exists, including human beings, consists of sound vibrations, called nāda. The aim of hatha yoga is to hear the nadam – the soundless sound, which is [[Om]] – by first perfecting the ability to listen. Jivamukti Yoga practices this through chanting and inspirational music.&lt;ref name=jivamuktisweden&gt;{{cite web|title=The Five Pillars of Jivamukti Yoga|url=http://www.jivamuktiyoga.se/about/5_pillars/|publisher=Jivamukti Yoga Sweden|accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jivamukti classes typically include Sanskrit chanting which integrates scriptural study and bhakti practice with nāda yoga.

Contrary to many other schools of yoga, Jivamukti teachers generally do not do the postures while they teach a class. This encourages students to learn by listening, rather than by watching, and in this way develop their ability to listen effectively. Sharon Gannon summarizes the intention of this approach as follows: “Through listening, hearing arises, through hearing knowing, through knowing becoming, by becoming being is possible.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marguin |first=Vita |title=I am yoga - I am activism - I am Jivamukti |url=http://kmyoga.com/i-am-yoga-i-am-activism-i-am-jivamukti/ |accessdate=23 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801025617/http://kmyoga.com/i-am-yoga-i-am-activism-i-am-jivamukti/ |archivedate= 1 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dhyana===
[[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]], or [[meditation]], as taught in the Jivamukti method is the practice of being still and watching one's own mind think. This practice is intended to enable a person to cease to identify with their thoughts and realize that they are more than their thoughts. All Jivamukti Yoga classes include a meditation practice.&lt;ref name=jivamuktisweden/&gt;

==Class experience==
There are six types of classes particular to Jivamukti:

*Open
: Jivamukti Open classes center on a theme based on a globally-set "Focus of the Month" essay, usually written by either Sharon Gannon or David Life. The theme is explored through "dharma talks", Sanskrit chanting, reflections on the modern relevance of yoga scripture, music, [[asanas]] (postures or poses), [[pranayama]] (breathing), and meditation. The largest portion of the class consists of asana practiced as [[vinyasa]]. In vinyasa (movement synchronized with breath and intention) the teacher guides the student through a vigorous sequence of poses. The exact sequence is left to the discretion of the teacher, but always includes inversions, such as headstand and shoulderstand. During the vinyasa phase, the teacher assists practitioners with hands-on adjustments. The class concludes with a period of deep relaxation and meditation. 
*Basic
: The Jivamukti Basic class is structured as a four-week fundamentals course that explores a different aspect of yoga each week. Starting with standing asanas, it next covers forward bending asanas, then backward bending asanas, and concludes with inversions and meditation. Whereas in the Beginner Vinyasa and Open classes vinyasa is emphasized, the Basic class stresses alignment. Students are taught “how to do” asanas and the use of props. The Basic class lays the foundation for eventual progression to an Open or Spiritual Warrior class. 
*Beginner Vinyasa
: Jivamukti Beginner Vinyasa classes are designed to provide a beginner student with the underlying basics of how a vinyasa practice works. The class follows a set sequence of asanas but is presented at a slower, more relaxed pace than in the Spiritual Warrior or Open classes. Beginner Vinyasa classes provide beginner students with a transition from a Basic to an Open class, and more advanced students with the opportunity to refine their skills through deeper, slower exploration.
*Spiritual Warrior
: Jivamukti Spiritual Warrior classes are designed with busy people in mind who only have one hour to practice. The structure is a set, vinyasa-style sequence which includes chanting, an asana warm-up, sun salutations, standing poses, forward bends, twists, backbends, inversions, relaxation, and meditation. In the Spiritual Warrior class the teacher focuses on maintaining the pace, rather than on giving spiritual discourses.
*In-Class Private
: Traditionally, yoga was taught one on one—one teacher teaching one student at a time. In modern times, yoga is more often taught in group classes. The Jivamukti In-Class Private (or ICP) allows students to experience both methods of teaching simultaneously: the student and his or her private certified Jivamukti Yoga teacher together attend a regular group class. From beginning to end, the student practices with the guidance and hands-on assists of the private teacher. ICPs always conclude with a special deep relaxation yoga massage in [[savasana|shavasana]], or corpse pose. An ICP can be adapted to almost any Jivamukti Yoga class, but is most frequently given in an Open class.
*Meditation
: The Jivamukti Yoga method of meditation is a [[mantra]] form of meditation, and follows a three-step procedure: choose a seat, be still, and focus. The mantra “Let-Go” is taught to all Jivamukti students, and provides the focus. The practitioner is instructed to align the silent repetition of the mantra with the incoming and outgoing breath. By witnessing the continuous movement of breath through the body and thought through the mind, Jivamukti teaches that the practitioner can eventually let go of identification with the body and mind and come to realize the supreme Self. The Jivamukti method holds realization of the supreme self or enlightenment to be the ultimate goal of yoga. The class usually begins with Sanskrit chanting; this is followed by detailed meditation instruction and then about 20 minutes of actual sitting practice. Afterwards there is a Q&amp;A session with the teacher, and a final closing.

The trade name and trademark ''Jivamukti'' is owned by Jivamukti, Inc., a for-profit corporation based in [[Shady, New York]], U.S., and has been continuously used in connection with the corporation's business since 1984.&lt;ref name=WIPO&gt;{{cite web|title=Administrative Panel Decision Jivamukti, Inc. v.

==Centers==
Jivamukti Yoga is the primary method taught at eleven yoga centers ("full program centers") and is also formally recognized as being taught at more than thirty others ("affiliate centers"). Instruction in these centers is based on the philosophy developed by Gannon and Life, which is in turn based on the guidance of their gurus and on classical yoga as described in the ''[[Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali]]'', the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', and ''[[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]]''. To teach the Jivamukti Yoga method in one of its centers, an instructor is first required to go through rigorous training and to pass a series of examinations.

Jivamukti Yoga's full program centers are located in the United States ([[New York City]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], and [[Washington D.C.]]), Germany ([[Munich]], [[Berlin]], and [[Schloss Elmau]]), the United Kingdom ([[London]]), and Mexico ([[Puebla]]). Its affiliate centers are located in Australia, Germany, Greece, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States.&lt;ref name="JivamuktiNYC"/&gt;

Jivamukti Yoga School NYC, the Jivamukti Yoga school located at [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] in Manhattan, has been featured on the [[BBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[PBS]], and in the [[New York Times]] and [[New York Magazine]].&lt;ref name="yogajournal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hammond|first=Holly|title=Meet the Innovators! 25 American Originals Who Are Shaping Yoga Today|journal=Yoga Journal|date=October 2000|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Jivamukti Yoga School NYC established a 125-acre nature preserve in the [[Catskill Mountains]], near [[Woodstock, New York]]. Known as the Wild Woodstock Jivamukti Forest Sanctuary, it serves as the country [[ashram]] for the Jivamukti Yoga School and a safe haven and unpolluted habitat for diverse plant and animal species.&lt;ref name=sanctuary&gt;{{cite web|title=Wild Woodstock Jivamukti Forest Sanctuary|url=http://jivamuktiyoga.com/centers/wild-woodstock-jivamukti-forest-sanctuary|publisher=Jivamukti Yoga|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
In 2016, accusations of [[sexual harassment]] were made public against one of Jivamukti Yoga School’s most senior teachers, [http://www.ruthlauermanenti.com/bio/ Ruth Lauer-Manenti], by one of her female students. The student filed a lawsuit, which has since been settled for an undisclosed amount. [[Michelle Goldberg]], writing about the case for [[Slate (magazine)|Slate magazine]], questioned whether Jivamukti is a workplace, an [[ashram]], or a [[cult]], with a culture of spiritual abuse and secrecy.&lt;ref name="slate1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Michelle|title=A Workplace, an Ashram, or a Cult? Inside the sexual harassment lawsuit against Jivamukti Yoga. |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2016/04/jivamukti_sexual_harassment_lawsuit_says_the_yoga_studio_is_a_cult.html|publisher=The Slate Group LLC|accessdate=5 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Matthew Remski reported, based on interviews with former employees of Jivamukti, that Jivamukti Yoga School used [[non-disclosure agreements]] (NDAs) to "smooth over student grievances against teachers, or teacher’s [sic] grievances against management", and to prevent former students and employees from discussing the school’s culture. In exchange, Remski writes, departing personnel and students received cash payments or tuition refunds.&lt;ref name="remski"&gt;{{cite web|last=Remski|first=Matthew|title=Silence and Silencing at Jivamukti Yoga and Beyond|url=http://www.decolonizingyoga.com/silence-silencing-jivamukti-yoga-beyond/|publisher=Decolonizing Yoga|accessdate=5 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Dee''' (13 July 1527 – 1608 or 1609) was an English [[mathematics|mathematician]], [[astronomy|astronomer]], [[astrology|astrologer]], [[occultism|occult philosopher]],&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Julian Roberts|author=Roberts, R. Julian|title=Dee, John (1527–1609)|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|orig-year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7418|accessdate=6 December 2011|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/7418}} ({{ODNBsub}})&lt;/ref&gt; and advisor to [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. He devoted much of his life to the study of [[alchemy]], [[divination]], and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic philosophy]]. He was also an advocate of England's imperial expansion into a "[[British Empire]]", a term he is generally credited with coining.&lt;ref&gt;Gwyn A. Williams, ''When Was Wales? A History of the Welsh'' (London: Penguin, 1985), p.124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dee straddled the worlds of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and modern [[science]] just as the latter was emerging. One of the most learned men of his age, he had been invited to lecture on the [[geometry]] of [[Euclid]] at the [[University of Paris]] while still in his early twenties.  Dee was an ardent promoter of mathematics and a respected astronomer, as well as a leading expert in [[navigation]], having trained many of those who would conduct England's [[Age of Exploration#Northern European involvement|voyages of discovery]].

Simultaneously with these enormous efforts, Dee immersed himself in the worlds of [[Magic (supernatural)|sorcery]], [[astrology]] and [[Hermetic philosophy]]. He devoted much time and effort in the last thirty years or so of his life to attempting to commune with [[angels]] in order to learn the [[universal language]] of creation and bring about the pre-apocalyptic unity of mankind. A student of the [[Renaissance Neo-Platonism]] of [[Marsilio Ficino]], Dee did not draw distinctions between his mathematical research and his investigations into Hermetic magic, angel summoning and divination. Instead he considered all of his activities to constitute different facets of the same quest: the search for a transcendent understanding of the divine [[substantial form|forms]] which underlie the visible world, which Dee called "pure verities".

In his lifetime, Dee amassed one of the largest libraries in England. His high status as a scholar also allowed him to play a role in [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] politics. He served as an occasional advisor and tutor to Elizabeth I and nurtured relationships with her ministers [[Francis Walsingham]] and [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]]. Dee also tutored and enjoyed patronage relationships with Sir [[Philip Sidney]], his uncle [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]], and [[Edward Dyer]]. He also enjoyed patronage from [[Sir Christopher Hatton]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Dee was born in Tower Ward, London, to Rowland Dee, of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] descent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/waleshistory/2010/12/john_dee_magician_astronomer_astrologer.html |title=Blogs - Wales - John Dee, magician to Queen Elizabeth |publisher=BBC |date=2010-12-18 |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dwb"&gt;Jones and Chambers 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Dee.html |title=Dee biography |publisher=History.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://welshjournals.llgc.org.uk/browse/viewpage/llgc-id:1191402/llgc-id:1197855/llgc-id:1197889/getText |title=Welsh Journals Online |publisher=Welshjournals.llgc.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/resources/e-seminars/poole-paper |title=John Dee and the English Calendar: Science, Religion and Empire |last=Poole |first=Robert |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613195912/http://www.history.ac.uk/resources/e-seminars/poole-paper |archivedate=2011-06-13 |publisher=The Institute of Historical Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Johanna Wild. His surname "Dee" derived from the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''du'' ({{lang|en|black}}); his grandfather was Bedo Ddu of Nant-y-groes, [[Pilleth]], [[Radnorshire]], and John retained his connection with the locality. His father Roland was a [[Mercer (occupation)|mercer]] and gentleman [[courtier]] to [[Henry VIII]]. John Dee claimed to be a descendant of [[Rhodri the Great]],  Prince of Wales and constructed a pedigree showing his descent from Rhodri. Dee's family arrived in London in the wake of Henry Tudor's coronation as Henry VII.&lt;ref name="dwb"/&gt; Jane Dee was the daughter of William Wild.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Dee attended the [[Chelmsford]] Chantry School (now [[King Edward VI Grammar School (Chelmsford)|King Edward VI Grammar School]]) from 1535 to 1542.&lt;ref name="CFS 15"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Fell Smith, Charlotte |date=1909 |title=John Dee: 1527–1608 |location=London |publisher=Constable and Company |page=15 |accessdate=31 December 2015 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-6XeBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=%22John+Dee%22+Chelmsford+1542#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John%20Dee%22%20Chelmsford%201542&amp;f=false|isbn=9781291940411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered [[St John's College, Cambridge]], in November 1542, aged 15, graduating [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1545 or early 1546.&lt;ref name="CFS 15-16"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Fell Smith, Charlotte |date=1909 |title=John Dee: 1527–1608 |location=London |publisher=Constable and Company |pages=15 &amp; 16 |accessdate=31 December 2015 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-6XeBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=%22John+Dee%22+Chelmsford+1542#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John%20Dee%22%20Chelmsford%201542&amp;f=false|isbn=9781291940411 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="St John's"&gt;{{Cite web |year=2014 |title=A true &amp; faithful relation of what passed for many yeers between Dr John Dee ... and some spirits (London, 1659) |publisher=[[St John's College, Cambridge]] |url=http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/library/special_collections/early_books/pix/dee.htm |accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His abilities recognised, he became an original fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], on its founding by Henry VIII in 1546.&lt;ref name="CFS 16"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Fell Smith, Charlotte |date=1909 |title=John Dee: 1527–1608 |location=London |publisher=Constable and Company |page=15 |accessdate=31 December 2015 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-6XeBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22John+Dee%22+Trinity+1546#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John%20Dee%22%20Trinity%201546&amp;f=false|isbn=9781291940411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At Trinity, the clever stage effects he produced for a production of [[Aristophanes]]' [[Peace (play)|''Peace'']] procured him the reputation of being a magician that clung to him through life. In the late 1540s and early 1550s, he travelled in Europe, studying at [[Old University of Leuven|Louvain]] (1548) and [[Brussels]] and lecturing in Paris on [[Euclid]]. He studied with [[Gemma Frisius]] and became a close friend of the [[cartography|cartographer]] [[Gerardus Mercator]] and cartographer [[Abraham Ortelius]]. Dee also travelled extensively throughout Europe meeting and working with as well as learning from other leading continental mathematicians such as [[Federico Commandino]] in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="TC"&gt;https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2013/07/13/john-dee-the-mathematicall-praeface-and-the-english-school-of-mathematics/&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to England with an important collection of mathematical and astronomical instruments. In 1552, he met [[Gerolamo Cardano]] in London: during their acquaintance they investigated a [[perpetual motion machine]] as well as a [[gem]] purported to have magical properties.&lt;ref name="GC"&gt;{{Cite book|title=De Vita Propria (The Book of My Life)|author=Gerolamo Cardano (trans. by Jean Stoner)|location=New York|publisher=New York Review of Books|date=2002|nopp=true|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His strong and lifelong penchant for secrecy perhaps worsening matters, this entire episode was only the most dramatic in a series of attacks and slanders that would dog Dee throughout his life. Clearing his name yet again, he soon became a close associate of Bonner.&lt;ref name="CFS" /&gt;

Dee presented Queen Mary with a visionary plan for the preservation of old books, manuscripts and records and the founding of a national library, in 1556, but his proposal was not taken up.&lt;ref name="CFS" /&gt; Instead, he expanded his personal library at his house in [[Mortlake]], tirelessly acquiring books and manuscripts in England and on the European Continent.

He claimed to have occult knowledge of treasure in the [[Welsh Marches]], and of valuable ancient manuscripts kept at [[Wigmore Castle]], knowing that the [[Lord Treasurer]]'s ancestors came from this area.&lt;ref&gt;John Strype, ''Annals of the Reformation'', Oxford (1824), vol.ii, part ii, no. XLV, 558–563&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1577, Dee published ''General and Rare Memorials pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation'', a work that set out his vision of a maritime empire and asserted English territorial claims on the [[New World]]. Dee was acquainted with [[Humphrey Gilbert]] and was close to Sir [[Philip Sidney]] and his circle.&lt;ref name="nav" /&gt;

In 1564, Dee wrote the [[Hermetica|Hermetic]] work ''[[Monas Hieroglyphica]]'' ("The Hieroglyphic [[Monad (disambiguation)|Monad]]"), an exhaustive [[Christian Kabbalah|Cabalistic]] interpretation of a [[glyph]] of his own design, meant to express the mystical unity of all creation. Having dedicated it to [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in an effort to gain patronage, Dee attempted to present it to him during the time of his ascension to the throne of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. This work was esteemed by many of Dee's contemporaries, but the work can not be interpreted today without the secret oral tradition from that era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Ambix|title=The Early Alchemical Reception of John Dee's Monas Hieroglyphica|author=Forshaw, Peter J. |volume=52| issue=3|date=2005|pages=247–269|publisher=Maney Publishing|doi=10.1179/000269805X77772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He published a "Mathematical Preface" to [[Henry Billingsley]]'s English translation of Euclid's ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' in 1570, arguing the central importance of mathematics and outlining mathematics' influence on the other arts and sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Dee (1527–1608): Alchemy – the Beginnings of Chemistry|url=http://www.msim.org.uk/uploadedDocs/Document_Depository_01/John%20Dee.pdf|publisher=Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester|date=2005|accessdate=26 October 2006|format=PDF|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060928120544/http://www.msim.org.uk/uploadedDocs/Document_Depository_01/John%20Dee.pdf |archivedate = 28 September 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intended for an audience outside the universities, it proved to be Dee's most widely influential and frequently reprinted work.&lt;ref name="SJ"&gt;{{cite web|title=The identity of the mathematical practitioner in 16th-century England|url=http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/staff/saj/texts/mathematicus.htm|author=Stephen Johnston|publisher=Museum of the History of Science, Oxford|date=1995|accessdate=27 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the important early products of the English School was the first English translation of the Elements of Euclid. This translation was carried out by The Lord Mayor of London Sir Henry Billingsley and not from a Latin translation but direct from the Greek. Published in 1570 this mathematical milestone contained a preface as well as copious notes and supplementary material from John Dee and this preface is considered to be one of Dee’s most important mathematical works.

===Later life===
[[File:John Dee's Seal of God.jpg|thumb|left|The "Seal of God", [[British Museum]]]]

By the early 1580s, Dee was growing dissatisfied with his progress in learning the secrets of nature as well as his failing influence and recognition in court circles. Failure of his proposed calendar revision, imperial recommendations and ambivalent results from exploration of North America had nearly brought his hopes of political patronage to an end. As a result, he began a more energetic turn towards the [[supernatural]] as a means to acquire knowledge. Specifically, he sought to contact spirits through the use of a "scryer" or [[crystal ball|crystal-gazer]], which would act as an intermediary between Dee and the angels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Canadian Journal of History|title=John Dee's Conversations with Angels: Cabala, alchemy, and the end of nature|author=Frank Klaassen|date=August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dee's first attempts with several scryers were not satisfactory, but, in 1582, he met [[Edward Kelley]] (then going under the name of Edward Talbot to disguise his conviction for "coining" or [[forgery]]), who impressed him greatly with his abilities.&lt;ref name="Calder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johndee.org/calder/html/TOC.html| author=Calder, I. R. F.| date=1952|title=John Dee Studied as an English Neo-Platonist|publisher=University of London|accessdate=26 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dee took Kelley into his service and began to devote all his energies to his supernatural pursuits.&lt;ref name="Calder" /&gt; These "spiritual conferences" or "actions" were conducted with an air of intense Christian piety, always after periods of purification, [[prayer]] and [[fasting]].&lt;ref name="Calder" /&gt; Dee was convinced of the benefits they could bring to mankind. (The character of Kelley is harder to assess: some have concluded that he acted with complete cynicism, but delusion or self-deception are not out of the question.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Dee, John|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date= 2006|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9029722/John-Dee|accessdate=27 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelley's "output" is remarkable for its sheer volume, its intricacy and its vividness). Dee maintained that the angels laboriously dictated several books to him this way, through Kelley, some in a special angelic or [[Enochian|Enochian language]].&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Meric Casaubon| title=A True &amp; Faithful Relation of What passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee (A Mathematician of Great Fame in Q.

[[File:Edward Kelly prophet or seer to Dr Dee 02355.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Kelley]]]]
In 1583, Dee met the visiting impoverished yet popular [[Poles|Polish]]  nobleman [[Albert Łaski]] who, after overstaying his welcome at court, invited Dee to accompany him on his return to [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]].&lt;ref name="mortlake" /&gt; With some prompting by the "angels" (again through Kelley) and his worsening status at court, Dee was persuaded to go. Dee, Kelley and their families left for the Continent in September 1583, but Łaski proved to be bankrupt and out of favour in his own country.&lt;ref name="CM"&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds]]|author=Mackay, Charles|chapter=4|location=London|publisher=Office of the National Illustrated Library|date=1852}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dee and Kelley began a [[nomad]]ic life in Central Europe, meanwhile continuing their spiritual conferences, which Dee recorded meticulously in his diaries and almanacs.&lt;ref name="MC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JD1" /&gt; They had audiences with [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II]] in [[Prague Castle]] and [[Stephen Báthory|King Stefan Batory]] of Poland whom they attempted to convince of the importance of angelic communication. The meeting with the Polish King, Stefan Batory, took place at the [[Niepołomice Castle|royal castle]] at [[Niepołomice]] (near [[Kraków]], then the capital of Poland) and was later widely analyzed by Polish historians (Ryszard Zieliński, Roman Żelewski, Roman Bugaj) and writers (Waldemar Łysiak).{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} While generally Dee was accepted as a man of wide and deep knowledge, they mistrusted his connection with the English monarch, Elizabeth I. They could not be sure that their meetings were without political ramifications. Some thought (and still do) that Dee was in fact a spy for the English monarch. Nevertheless, the Polish king, a devout Catholic and very cautious of supernatural media, began their meeting(s) with the affirmation that any prophetic revelations must be in keeping with the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]], the mission of the [[Catholic Church|Holy Catholic Church]], and the approval of the Pope.

In 1587, during a spiritual conference in [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], Kelley informed Dee that the angel [[Uriel]] had ordered the men to share all their possessions, including their wives. By this time, Kelley had gained some renown as an alchemist and in fact was more sought-after than Dee in this regard: this was a line of work that had prospects for serious and long-term financial gain, especially among the royal families of central Europe. Dee, on the other hand, was more interested in communicating with the angels who he believed would help him solve the mysteries of the heavens through mathematics, optics, astrology, science and navigation. It may be that Kelley in fact wished to end Dee's dependence on him as a scryer for their increasingly lengthy and frequent spiritual conferences.&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt; The order for wife-sharing caused Dee great anguish, but he apparently did not doubt its genuineness. They apparently did share wives. However, Dee broke off the conferences immediately afterwards. Dee returned to England in 1589: Kelley went on to be the alchemist for Emperor Rudolf II.&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alchemyguild.org/history.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228120813/http://www.alchemyguild.org/history.htm|archivedate=2009-02-28|title=History of the Alchemy Guild|publisher=International Alchemy Guild|accessdate=26 October 2006|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine months later, on 28 February 1588, a son was born to Dee's wife, whom Dee baptised Theodorus Trebonianus Dee and raised as his own. It is possible that this child was Kelley's; Dee was 60 at the time, Edward Kelley was 32.

===Final years===
[[File:John Dee memorial plaque at S Mary the Virgin Mortlake.jpg|thumb|John Dee memorial plaque installed in 2013 inside the church of [[St Mary the Virgin Mortlake]]]]
Dee returned to [[Mortlake]] after six years abroad to find his home vandalized, his library ruined and many of his prized books and instruments stolen.&lt;ref name="SJCC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt; Furthermore, Dee found that increasing criticism of [[occult]] practices had made England even more inhospitable to his magical practices and natural philosophy. Dee sought support from Elizabeth, who hoped he could persuade Kelley to return and ease England's economic burdens through alchemy.&lt;ref&gt;“Although it is indeed probable that Kelly was more accomplished and also more devoted to pursuing the way of transmuting base metals to gold, his master approached alchemy in a more subtle and complex way. He did not stand next to the furnace and the alembic day and night, but in his diaries he documented his practical experiments.”{{cite web | last = Szőnyi| first = György E.| year = 2015 | url = http://www.renesancni-texty.upol.cz/soubory/publikace/Latin_Alchemical_Literature_of_Czech_Provenance.pdf | title = ‘Layers of Meaning in Alchemy in John Dee’s Monas hieroglyphica and its Relevance in a Central European Context‘| publisher =  Centre for Renaissance Texts, 2015, 100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She  finally appointed Dee Warden of [[Christ's College, Manchester]], in 1595.&lt;ref&gt;Dee, John (1842) ''Diary''.

==Personal life==
Dee was married three times and had eight children. He first married Katherine Constable in 1565; she died in 1574 and their union resulted in no children. His second (also childless) marriage to an unknown woman lasted only a year until her death in 1576.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncarved.org/turb/articles/deemap.html|title=ALCHEMICAL MANCHESTER - THE DEE CONNECTION|publisher=Uncarved.org|accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1577 to 1601, Dee kept a sporadic diary (also referred to as his "almanac") from which most of what we know about his life during that time has been gleaned.&lt;ref name="RM" /&gt; In 1578 he married the 23-year-old [[Jane Dee|Jane Fromond]]: Dee was fifty-one at the time. Jane had her own connections to the Elizabethan court: she was a lady in waiting to [[Elizabeth Clinton, Countess of Lincoln]], a position she gave up when she married Dee. When in 1587, Kelley informed Dee of the angel's wish that they share wives, Jane Dee (née Fromond) was the wife Dee shared with him. Although Dee complied with the angel's supposed request for a while, he was apparently distressed by the arrangement and it was one reason why the two men parted company not long thereafter. Some believe that Dee's son Theodore, born nine months later, could have been Kelley's son, not Dee's.&lt;ref name="RM" /&gt;

Jane died in Manchester of the bubonic plague and was buried in the Manchester Cathedral burial grounds in March 1604.&lt;ref&gt;Manchester Cathedral Archive, MS 1&lt;/ref&gt; Michael, born in Prague, died on his father's birthday in 1594. Theodore, born in [[Třeboň]], died in Manchester in 1601. His sons [[Arthur Dee]] and Rowland survived him, as did his daughter Katherine "who was his companion to the end".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johndee.org/charlotte/pdf/Appendix1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Appendix 1 : The Descendants of John Dee |publisher=Johndee.org |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; No records exist for his youngest daughters Madinia, Frances and Margaret after 1604, so it is widely assumed they died in the same epidemic that took their mother. (Dee had by this time ceased keeping his diary).&lt;ref name="CFS" /&gt;

While Arthur was a student at the [[Westminster School]], Dee wrote a letter to his headmaster that echoes the worries of boarding school parents in every century. Arthur was an apprentice in much of his father's alchemical and scientific work, and was in fact often his [[scryer]] until Kelley came along. Arthur went on to become an alchemist and hermetic author, whose works were published by [[Elias Ashmole]].&lt;ref name="CFS" /&gt;

As regards Dee's physical appearance, the antiquary [[John Aubrey]]&lt;ref&gt;Aubrey's great-grandfather William Aubrey was a cousin "and intimate acquaintance" of Dee.&lt;/ref&gt; gives the following description: "He was tall and slender. He wore a gown like an artist's gown, with hanging sleeves, and a slit.... A very fair, clear sanguine complexion... a long beard as white as milk. A very handsome man."&lt;ref name="BL" /&gt;

===Advocacy of English expansion===

From 1570 Dee advocated a policy of political and economic strengthening of England and imperial expansion into the New World.&lt;ref name = ODNB/&gt;  In his manuscript, ''Brytannicae reipublicae synopsis'' (1570), he outlined the current state of the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan Realm]]&lt;ref name = WTS&gt;William Howard Sherman ''John Dee: The Politics of Reading and Writing in the English Renaissance,'' Univ of Massachusetts Press, 1997 {{ISBN|1-55849-070-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was concerned with trade, ethics and national strength.&lt;ref name = ODNB /&gt;

His 1576 ''General and rare memorials pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation'' was the first volume in an unfinished series planned to advocate the rise of imperial expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Amelia Yates ''Astraea''&lt;/ref&gt; In the highly symbolic frontispiece, Dee included a figure of [[Britannia]]  kneeling by the shore beseeching Elizabeth I, to protect her empire by strengthening her navy.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Hewitt, 'Britannia (fl. 1st–21st cent.)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Dee used [[Geoffrey of Monmouth|Geoffrey]]'s inclusion of Ireland in [[King Arthur|Arthur's]] imperial conquests to argue that Arthur had established a 'British empire' abroad.&lt;ref&gt;O. J. Padel, 'Arthur (supp. fl. in or before 6th cent.)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He further argued that England exploit new lands through colonisation and that this vision could become reality through maritime supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Reputation and significance==
About ten years after Dee's death, the antiquarian [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Robert Cotton]] purchased land around Dee's house and began digging in search of papers and artifacts. He discovered several manuscripts, mainly records of Dee's angelic communications. Cotton's son gave these manuscripts to the scholar [[Méric Casaubon]], who published them in 1659, together with a long introduction critical of their author, as ''A True &amp; Faithful Relation of What passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee (A Mathematician of Great Fame in Q. Eliz. and King James their Reignes) and some spirits.''&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; As the first public revelation of Dee's spiritual conferences, the book was extremely popular and sold quickly. Casaubon, who believed in the reality of spirits, argued in his introduction that Dee was acting as the unwitting tool of evil spirits when he believed he was communicating with angels. This book is largely responsible for the image, prevalent for the following two and a half centuries, of Dee as a dupe and deluded fanatic.&lt;ref name="WIT" /&gt; Around the same time the ''True and Faithful Relation'' was published, members of the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] movement claimed Dee as one of their number.&lt;ref name="HJ"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The Hermetic Journal|author=Ron Heisler|title = John Dee and the Secret Societies|date=1992|url=http://www.levity.com/alchemy/h_dee.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is doubt, however, that an organized Rosicrucian movement existed during Dee's lifetime, and no evidence that he ever belonged to any secret fraternity.&lt;ref name="Calder"/&gt; Dee's reputation as a magician and the vivid story of his association with [[Edward Kelley]] have made him a seemingly irresistible figure to [[fabulist]]s, writers of [[horror fiction|horror stories]] and latter-day [[magician (paranormal)|magicians]]. The accretion of false and often fanciful information about Dee often obscures the facts of his life, remarkable as they are in themselves. It also does nothing to promote his Christian leanings: Dee looked to the angels to speak to him about how he might heal the very deep and serious rifts between the Roman Catholic Church, the Reformed Church of England and the Protestant movement in England.&lt;ref name="KN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shpltd.co.uk/neal-rhetoric.pdf |title=The Rhetoric of Utility: Avoiding Occult Associations For Mathematics Through Profitability and Pleasure|author=Katherine Neal|publisher=University of Sydney|date=1999|accessdate=27 October 2006|format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080528234717/http://www.shpltd.co.uk/neal-rhetoric.pdf |archivedate = 28 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Elizabeth I used him as her court astronomer on a number of occasions not solely because he practised Hermetic arts, but because he was a deeply religious and learned man whom she trusted.

A re-evaluation of Dee's character and significance came in the 20th century, largely as a result of the work of the historians Charlotte Fell-Smith and Dame [[Frances Yates]]. Both writers brought into focus the parallel roles magic, science and religion held in the Elizabethan [[Renaissance]]. Fell-Smith writes: "There is perhaps no learned author in history who has been so persistently misjudged, nay, even slandered, by his posterity, and not a voice in all the three centuries uplifted even to claim for him a fair hearing. Surely it is time that the cause of all this universal condemnation should be examined in the light of reason and science; and perhaps it will be found to exist mainly in the fact that he was too far advanced in speculative thought for his own age to understand." &lt;ref&gt;Fell-Smith, Charlotte "John Dee: 1527-1608" Constable &amp; Company Ltd. London. 1909&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this and subsequent re-evaluation, Dee is now viewed as a serious scholar and book-collector, a devoted Christian (albeit during a very confusing time for that faith), an able scientist, and one of the most learned men of his day.&lt;ref name="WIT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FY"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theatre of the World|author=Frances A. Yates|publisher=Routledge|location=London|date=1987|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His personal library at Mortlake was the largest in the country (before it was vandalized), and was created at enormous and sometimes ruinous personal expense; it was considered one of the finest in Europe, perhaps second only to that of [[Jacques Auguste de Thou|De Thou]]. As well as being an astrological and scientific advisor to Elizabeth and her court, he was an early advocate of the [[European colonization of the Americas|colonisation of North America]] and a visionary of a British Empire stretching across the North Atlantic.&lt;ref name="nav" /&gt;

Dee promoted the sciences of navigation and [[cartography]]. He studied closely with Gerardus Mercator, and he owned an important collection of maps, [[globe]]s and astronomical instruments. He developed new instruments as well as special navigational techniques for use in [[polar regions]]. Dee served as an advisor to the English voyages of discovery, and personally selected pilots and trained them in navigation.&lt;ref name="CFS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nav" /&gt; He believed that mathematics (which he understood mystically) was central to the progress of human learning. The centrality of mathematics to Dee's vision makes him to that extent more modern than [[Francis Bacon]], though some scholars believe Bacon purposely downplayed mathematics in the anti-occult atmosphere of the reign of James I.&lt;ref name="FB"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|jstor=2709891|title=Francis Bacon and the Progress of Knowledge|author=Brian Vickers| volume=53| issue=3|date=July 1992|pages=495–518|doi=10.2307/2709891|authorlink=Brian Vickers (academic)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, though, that Dee's understanding of the role of mathematics is radically different from our contemporary view.&lt;ref name="SJ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SJ2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Like father, like son? John Dee, Thomas Digges and the identity of the mathematician|url=http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/staff/saj/texts/dee-digges.htm|author=Stephen Johnston|publisher=Museum of the History of Science, Oxford|date=1995|accessdate=27 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dee's promotion of mathematics outside the universities was an enduring practical achievement. As with most of his writings, Dee chose to write in English, rather than Latin, to make his writings accessible to the general public. His "Mathematical Preface" to Euclid was meant to promote the study and application of mathematics by those without a university education, and was very popular and influential among the "mecanicians": the new and growing class of technical craftsmen and artisans. Dee's preface included demonstrations of mathematical principles that readers could perform themselves without special education or training.&lt;ref name="SJ" /&gt;

During the 20th century, the [[Municipal Borough of Richmond (Surrey)|Municipal Borough of Richmond]] (now the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]]) honoured John Dee by naming a street near Mortlake, where he lived, "Dee Road" after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=James|title= The Streets of Richmond and Kew|publisher=Richmond Local History Society|edition=1990|ISBN=0950819859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calendar===
Dee was a friend of [[Tycho Brahe]] and was familiar with the work (translated into English by his ward and assistant, [[Thomas Digges]]) of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]].&lt;ref name="CFS" /&gt; Many of his astronomical calculations were based on Copernican assumptions, but he never openly espoused the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory. Dee applied Copernican theory to the problem of [[calendar]] reform. In 1583, he was asked to advise the Queen about the new [[Gregorian calendar]] that had been promulgated by [[Pope Gregory XIII]] from October 1582. His advice was that England should accept it, albeit with seven specific amendments. The first of these was that the adjustment should not be the 10 days that would restore the calendar to the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] in 325 AD, but by 11 days, which would restore it to the birth of Christ. Another proposal of Dee's was to align the civil and liturgical years, and to have them both start on 1 January. Perhaps predictably, England chose to spurn any suggestions that had papist origins, despite any merit they may objectively have, and Dee's advice was rejected.&lt;ref name="IHR" /&gt;

===Voynich manuscript===
He has often been associated with the [[Voynich manuscript]].&lt;ref name="Calder" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Dee's contacts with Rudolph were far less extensive than had previously been thought, however, and Dee's diaries show no evidence of the sale. Dee was, however, known to have possessed a copy of the ''[[Book of Soyga]]'', another enciphered book.&lt;ref name="JR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~reedsj/soyga.pdf|last=Reeds|first=Jim|title=John Dee and the Magic Tables in the Book of Soyga|date=1996|accessdate=8 November 2006|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305174955/http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~reedsj/soyga.pdf|archivedate=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artefacts===
[[File:Artefatos de Dee.jpg|thumb|Objects used by Dee in his magic, now in the [[British Museum]].]]

The [[British Museum]] holds several items once owned by Dee and associated with the spiritual conferences:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/d/dr_dees_magic.aspx|title=Dr Dee's magic|publisher=British Museum |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706023923/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/d/dr_dees_magic.aspx |archivedate=2010-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dee's Speculum or [[Mirrors in Mesoamerican culture|Mirror]] (an [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] [[Aztec]] cult object in the shape of a hand-mirror, brought to Europe in the late 1520s), which was subsequently owned by [[Horace Walpole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/d/dr_dees_mirror.aspx|title=Dr Dee's mirror|publisher=British Museum |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707022436/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/d/dr_dees_mirror.aspx |archivedate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer Rampling has claimed that Dee never actually owned this object{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}. The item now residing in the British Museum was first attributed to Dee by Horace Walpole. Lord Frederick Campbell had brought "a round piece of shining black marble in a leathern case" to Walpole in an attempt to ascertain the object's provenance. According to Walpole, he responded saying "Oh, Lord, I am the only man in England that can tell you! It is Dr. Dee's black stone". There is no explicit reference to the mirror in any of Dee's surviving writings. The provenance of the Museum's obsidian speculum, as well as the crystal ball, is in fact dubious.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* The small [[seal (device)|wax seals]] used to support the legs of Dee's "table of practice" (the table at which the [[scrying]] was performed).
* The large, elaborately decorated wax "Seal of God", used to support the "shew-stone", the [[crystal ball]] used for scrying.
* A gold [[amulet]] engraved with a representation of one of Kelley's visions.
* A crystal globe, six centimetres in diameter. This item remained unnoticed for many years in the mineral collection; possibly the one owned by Dee, but the provenance of this object is less certain than that of the others.&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/bshm/zingaz/London2.html|title=BSHM Gazetteer – LONDON: British Museum, British Library and Science Museum|publisher=British Society for the History of Mathematics|date=August 2002|accessdate=27 October 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211081852/http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/bshm/zingaz/London2.html|archivedate=2006-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2004, both a [[shew stone]] (a stone used for scrying) formerly belonging to Dee and a mid-17th century explanation of its use written by [[Nicholas Culpeper]] were stolen from the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in London; they were recovered shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="G"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1398477,00.html|title=Museum thief spirits away old crystal ball|author=Adam Fresco|work=The Times |date=11 December 2004|accessdate=27 October 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Knowledge Ark''' (also known as a doomsday ark or doomsday vault) is a collection of [[knowledge]] preserved in such a way that future generations would have access to said knowledge if current means of access were lost.  

Scenarios where availability to [[information]] (such as the [[Internet]]) would be lost could be described as [[Existential risk|Existential Risks]] or [[Extinction level event|Extinction Level Events]].  A knowledge ark could take the form of a traditional [[Library]] or a modern [[Database|computer database]]. It could also include images only (such as photographs of important information, or diagrams of critical processes). 

A knowledge ark would have to be resistant to the effects of natural or man-made disasters to be viable. Such an ark should include, but would not be limited to, information or material relevant to the survival and prosperity of human civilization.

Current examples include the [[Svalbard Global Seed Vault]], a [[seedbank]] which is intended to preserve a wide variety of plant seeds (such as important crops) in case of their extinction.

A [[Colonization of the Moon#Lunar ark|Lunar ark]] has been proposed which would store and transmit valuable information to receiver stations on Earth. The success of this would also depend on the availability of compatible receiver equipment on Earth, and adequate knowledge of that equipment's operation.

Other types of knowledge arks might include [[genetics|genetic]] material. With the potential for widespread personal DNA sequencing becoming a reality, an individual might agree to store their [[genetic code]] in a digital or analog storage format which would enable later retrieval of that code. If a species was sequenced before extinction, its [[genome]] would remain available for study even in the case of extinction.

The Phoenix mars lander (landed on surface of Mars in 2008) included the Visions of Mars DVD, a library on Mars. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/press-room/releases/2008/0527_Phoenix_Takes_Image_of_First_Library_on.html|title=Phoenix Takes Image of First Library on Mars|website=www.planetary.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/08/070814-lunar-ark.html|title='Lunar Ark' Proposed in Case of Deadly Impact on Earth|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lisa Bortolotti''' (born 1974 in [[Bologna]]) is an Italian philosopher who is currently Professor of Philosophy in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Birmingham]], United Kingdom. Her work is in the [[philosophy of the cognitive sciences]], including [[philosophy of psychology]] and [[philosophy of psychiatry]], as well as [[bioethics]] and [[medical ethics]]. She was educated at the [[University of Bologna]], [[King's College London]], [[University of Oxford]] and the [[Australian National University]], and worked briefly at the [[University of Manchester]] before beginning at Birmingham, where she has been a [[lecturer]], [[senior lecturer]], [[reader (academic rank)|reader]] and now [[professor]].

She has published three sole-authored books: ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science'' ([[Polity Press]], 2008); ''Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2009); and ''Irrationality'' (Polity, 2014). ''Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs'', in which Bortolotti challenges the argument that [[delusion]]s cannot be [[belief]]s due to their [[irrationality]], was the winner of the 2011 [[American Philosophical Association]] book prize. In addition, she edited ''Philosophy and Happiness'' ([[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2009) and ''Delusions in Context'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018) and co-edited ''Psychiatry as Cognitive Neuroscience: Philosophical Perspectives'' (Oxford University Press, 2009).

==Education==
Bortolotti studied philosophy at the [[University of Bologna]], spending several months at the [[University of Leeds]], graduating in 1997. Her [[undergraduate dissertation]], supervised by [[Eva Picardi]], was on [[ontology|conceptual]] [[relativism]]. In 1998, she graduated with an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in philosophy from [[King's College London]]. Here, she wrote on [[scientific revolution]]s under [[Donald A. Gillies|Donald Gillies]]. Next, she moved to the [[University of Oxford]], where she read for a [[BPhil]]. Her thesis, supervised by [[Bill Newton-Smith]], was on "the rationality debate in philosophy and the cognitive sciences". Bortolotti read for her PhD at the [[Australian National University]]. Her [[doctoral thesis]], which was supervised by [[Martin Davies (philosopher)|Martin Davies]], challenged [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]'s account of [[belief]] ascription. She completed her PhD in 2004.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bortolotti, Lisa|url=https://sites.google.com/site/lisabortolottiphilosophy/CV|accessdate=17 August 2016|title=Essential CV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:2018 Book DelusionsInContext.pdf|thumb|right|The [[ebook]] version of Bortolotti's 2018 edited collection ''Delusions in Context''.]]
Bortolotti worked as a [[research associate]] at the [[University of Manchester]] from 2004–2005. She worked as part of the Centre for Social Ethics and Policy (where she was also a [[honorary lecturer]]) under [[John Harris (philosopher)|John Harris]] on a project exploring the nature of research, also covering [[research ethics]] and law. She became a part of the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Birmingham]] in 2005, as a [[lecturer]]. In 2007, she took up a [[visiting professor]]ship at the [[European School of Molecular Medicine]], [[Milan]], which she held until 2008; in that same year, she spent several months at the Macquarie Centre for Cognitive Science, [[Macquarie University]] on a [[research fellowship]] and was promoted to [[senior lecturer]] at the University of Birmingham.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; 2008 was also the year of publication of her first book, which was a [[textbook]] entitled ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science'', published by [[Polity Press|Polity]].&lt;ref&gt;Bortolotti, Lisa (2008). ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. Cambridge: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] version was published in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Bortolotti, Lisa (2013). ''Introdução à Filosofia da Ciência''. Lisbon: Gradiva.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bortolotti published three books in 2009. She edited ''Philosophy and Happiness'', a [[edited collection|collection]] released by [[Palgrave Macmillan]],&lt;ref&gt;Botolotti, Lisa, ed. (2009). ''Philosophy and Happiness''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; and co-edited, with Matthew R. Broome, ''Psychiatry as Cognitive Neuroscience: Philosophical Perspectives''.&lt;ref&gt;Broome, Matthew R., and Lisa Bortolotti, eds. (2009). ''Psychiatry as Cognitive Neuroscience: Philosophical Perspectives''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The former book arose from a 2007 conference at Birmingham entitled Happiness and the Meaning of Life. It featured 14 chapters, split into two sections: "Happiness and the Meaningful Life" and "Happiness and the Mind".&lt;ref&gt;Waghorn, Nicholas (13 July 2010).

''International Journal of Wellbeing'' '''1''' (1): 189–92. {{doi|10.5502/ijw.v1i1.19}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter book was published by [[Oxford University Press]], and contained essays by a range of academics, broadly addressing the status of [[psychiatry]] as a [[science]]. It was widely reviewed,&lt;ref&gt;St. Stoyanov, Drozdstoj (217 May 2009).

Bortolotti's third book in 2009 was ''Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs'', a [[monograph]] exploring [[delusion]]s and requirements for the ascription of [[beliefs]].&lt;ref&gt;Bortolotti, Lisa (2009). ''Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was highly successful, being awarded the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s 2011 book prize. Granted in recognition of the "best ... book published by a younger scholar in the previous two years", the prize is awarded every two years and carries with it a [[US$]]4000 award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?book|title=Book Prize|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was reviewed in a number of publications,&lt;ref&gt;Radden, Jennifer (20 July 2010).

}}
In ''Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs'', Bortolotti challenges the idea that delusions are not beliefs given that they are irrational. While held to be beliefs in the medical literature, the status of delusions is disputed by philosophers, who have denied that delusions are beliefs on account of their deeply unusual content—such as [[Cotard delusion|the delusion that one is actually dead]]—and because they work differently from paradigmatic beliefs. For example, delusions are often maintained despite overwhelming counter-evidence, or are not reacted to in the way one would expect given their content.&lt;ref name="précis"/&gt;

After setting out the background to the question, Bortolotti explores whether the procedural irrationality of delusions—the fact that they do not rationally relate to the other [[intentional state]]s of the agent—justifies the denial that they are beliefs. She denies that it does, given that many paradigm beliefs display failures of procedural rationality. She then moves on to the [[epistemic]] irrationality of delusions, i.e., the fact that they are not supported by evidence. This can also not be used to challenge the status of delusions as beliefs, she argues, as many widespread ordinary beliefs are also epistemically irrational. She next addresses the idea that delusions are not beliefs as, first, they are not acted upon in the appropriate way, and, second, people with delusions cannot provide good reasons for their holding the content of the delusion. Though allowing that these characterisations of people with delusions can be correct, she argues that these failures of so-called agential rationality can also be found in people who do not have delusions. Bortolotti holds that the status of thoughts which subjects do not endorse (such as [[Thought insertion|inserted thoughts]]) as beliefs is in question, but that beliefs that are both endorsed and self-ascribed contribute to one's conception of self as part of a self-narrative.&lt;ref name="précis"/&gt;

She concludes her book by rejecting the rationality constraint on belief ascription. She challenges the idealisation of beliefs, but endorses the goal of separating beliefs and other intentional states. She argues that the difference between delusional and normal beliefs must concern more than their epistemic features. The difference between delusions and irrational (but non-delusional) beliefs is, she claims, one of degree, and not one of kind.&lt;ref name="précis"/&gt;

'''María Zambrano Alarcón''' (22 April 1904, in [[Vélez-Málaga]] &amp;ndash; 6 February 1991, in [[Madrid]]) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[essayist]] and [[philosophy|philosopher]] associated with the [[Generation of '36]] movement. She was awarded the [[Prince of Asturias Award]] (1981) and the [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]] (1988).

==Biography==
María Zambrano Alarcón was born on 22 April 1904 in [[Vélez-Málaga]], [[Spain]], daughter of Blas José Zambrano García de Carabante, friend and colaborator of [[Antonio Machado]], and Araceli Alarcón Delgado. In 1905, the family moved to [[Madrid]].

Zambrano studied under and was influenced by [[José Ortega y Gasset]] and went on to teach metaphysics at [[Complutense University of Madrid|Madrid University]] and at the [[Instituto de Bachillerato Cervantes (Madrid)|Instituto Cervantes]] from 1931 to 1936. 
During the 20s and 30s, she actively campaigned for the establishment of the Spanish Second Republic. However, after Spain became a Republic again, disillusioned with the realities of party politics, she declined the possibility of becoming an MP and refused further participation in party politics. Nevertheless, with the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936, she openly sided with the Republic and consequently went into exile after its defeat in 1939.  

After living in [[France]], [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Italy]], [[France]] again and [[Switzerland]], Zambrano finally returned to Madrid in 1984.

== Recognition ==
Respected by her peers, she maintained contact with Italian intellectuals as well as her compatriots [[Rafael Alberti]] and [[Jorge Guillén]].

A slow process of recognition of her work commenced in Spain in 1966 with the publication of [[J. L. Aranguren]]'s article "Los sueños de María Zambrano" (The Dreams of María Zambrano) in the important cultural and scientific ''Revista de Occidente'', founded by Ortega y Gasset, a review to which leading contemporary philosophers such as [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Edmund Husserl]] contributed.

In 1981 she was awarded the [[Prince of Asturias Award]] for Communications and Humanities in its first edition, and in 1983 Malaga University named her [[Doctor honoris causa]].

In 1988 she became the first woman to be awarded the [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]].

[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435189/ ''María querida''] (''Dearest Maria''), a film directed by [[:Es:José Luis García Sánchez|José Luis García Sánchez]] in 2004, is about her life.

In December 2007, when the Málaga-Madrid high speed railway line was opened, the railway company [[RENFE]] renamed Málaga Railway Station "María Zambrano".

''The Seated Man:Homo Sedens.'' Dafina Publications: Copenhagan; [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] 1974. “Ethology and Stress Diseases”. ''Science'' 185:20-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these techniques is based on correcting common postural faults by addressing the neuromuscular system through postural re-education. Yet, the Mitzvah Technique encompasses both a unique philosophy and a set of procedures. This includes the discipline, exercises, and the work that Mitzvah Technique practitioners do with their hands.&lt;ref&gt;R. Omel. "The Mitzvah Technique: a proactive approach to optimizing the benefits of chiropractic care." ''Today's Chiropractic'': July 2000 (29:4): 52-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
The Mitzvah Technique has been designed as an easily learned rehabilitative and self-care discipline. It utilizes body mechanics in the acts of standing, sitting, and walking. The philosophy is that with practice, the discipline becomes integrated into all common activities of daily life.

The Mitzvah Technique is based on the philosophy of the Mitzvah Mechanism. The Mechanism consists of a sequence of natural body movements that magnify the rippling motion in the body. There are four components to the Mitzvah Mechanism: (1) The interplay of physical forces acting between the pelvis and spine, (2) the rippling spinal motion, (3) the dynamic relationship involving the pelvis, spine and head in a synchronized motion, and (4) the freedom of the head to balance on its spinal support. All of these together promote the operation of the Mitzvah Mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;M. Cohen-Nehemia. ''The Mitzvah Technique and The Mitzvah Exercise.'' Halifax: Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Dalhousie University: 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mitzvah Technique is designed to improve posture and release tension and stress through exercises and therapeutic table work. It claims to realign, rebalance and exercise the entire body during sitting, standing and walking. Its aim is to replace long-term work by practitioners, to have people learn how to use the Mitzvah Technique itself. Musicians, actors and singers have been extensive users.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen-Nehemiah, M. "The Mitzvah Technique." Presentation to the 18th World Congress of Natural Medicine, Havana, April 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Mitzvah Exercise==
The Mitzvah Technique contends that activating and practicing the Mitzvah Exercise and mastering its discipline are what corrects faulty posture and, by extension, many of the aches and pains associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;M. Cohen-Nehemia and N.F. Clinch. 1982. “A New Procedure for Improving Body Mechanics: An Experimental Test”. ''Perceptual and Motor Skills'' 55:363-368.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mitzvah Exercise is a set of movements involving sitting, standing, and walking. The Exercise requires no special equipment other than a chair or stool and space for walking around. The seat should be firm and flat and low enough so that the feet will be flat on the floor when the body is seated. Loose clothing and no shoes are suggested.  This is to allow freedom of movement at the hip joint and the transfer of energy through the feet.

The Exercise should be performed under the direction of a suitable Mitzvah Technique teacher and does not substitute for necessary professional health care. It is best described in a booklet prepared by the founder of the Technique, M. Cohen-Nehemia: ''The Mitzvah Exercise and Its Principle''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Cohen-Nehemia, ''The Mitzvah Exercise and Its Principle: Improving Human Performance.'' Toronto: Mitzvah Technique Centre, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mitzvah Technique is designed to improve posture and release tension and stress through exercises and therapeutic table work. It is based on the "Mitzvah Mechanism", an upward rippling motion that gently reinforces the body’s balance with gravity. It realigns, rebalances and exercises the entire body during sitting, standing and walking. As a result, this mechanism is readily applied to daily activities.

The technique was developed by M. Cohen-Nehemia of [[Toronto]], a Yemeni-Israeli immigrant to [[Canada]]. It was originally derived from the [[Alexander Technique]], but has independently developed since the early 1970s.

==History==
M. Cohen-Nehemia, the originator of the Mitzvah Technique was born and raised in [[Jerusalem]] in 1924. There he studied classical, modern and oriental dance and was a member of the [[Inbal Dance Theater]] of Israel. Similar to [[F. M. Alexander]] who lost his voice as an actor and regained it through self-discovery,&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, W. 1973. ''The Alexander Principle.'' London: Gollancz&lt;/ref&gt; Nehemia suffered major back problems as a dancer and gained functionality by successfully helping himself through his own experiences and research on body movement. He participated in training seminars for dance and physical education teachers at the [[kibbutz]] school which gave him insights into the relationship between body movement and body health.

Nehemia also studied anatomy with Dr. Yitzhak Farine of the Tel-Hashomer government hospital. This resulted in Dr. Farine inviting Nehemia to work at the hospital’s rehabilitation center. Nehemia was introduced to the [[Alexander Technique]] through a course given at the [[Sheba Medical Center|Tel HaShomer Hospital]] to medical staff. This introduction affected Nehemia’s work. Together with his wife Malka, they travelled to [[London]] where Nehemia spent five years qualifying as an Alexander Teacher at the London School as well as studying at F.M. Alexander’s studio. He concomitantly began developing his own version of the Alexander Technique that he called the Mitzvah Technique to emphasize the rippling motion of the body.

When Nehemia returned to Israel, he assisted [[Moshe Feldenkrais]] by introducing the Mitzvah Technique into the [[Feldenkrais Method]].&lt;ref&gt;Feldenkrais, M. 1972. ''Awareness Through Movement.'' New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; They worked together at the Tel HaShomer Hospital in the physical rehabilitation of wounded [[Israeli Defence Force]] soldiers suffering with severe back and spinal injuries. At the same time, Nehemia was taking classes given by Feldenkrais for teachers and actors. As a dancer and Alexander Teacher, Nehemia also spent years observing working bodies in action among animals, children, fellow Inbal dancers and the nomadic [[Bedouin]]. Out of these myriad experiences and observations came the fuller development of the Mitzvah Technique, emphasizing the natural rippling motion of the spine.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen-Nehemia, M. ''The Mitzvah Technique and the Mitzvah Exercise'' Halifax, NS, Canada: Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Dalhousie University, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

Nehemia came to [[Toronto]] in the late 1960s where he established the Centre for the Alexander Technique that later became the Mitzvah Technique Centre. This centre has trained scores of Mitzvah teachers and treated thousands of clients who have come from around the world. Nehemia died November 18, 2018 at the age of 94 after years debilitated by a stroke.

}}'''''Passage Meditation''''' is a book by [[Eknath Easwaran]], originally published in 1978 with the title '''''Meditation'''''. The book describes a [[meditation]] program, also now commonly referred to as Passage Meditation. Easwaran developed this method of meditation in the 1960s, and first taught it systematically at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=makteach&gt;Tim Flinders &amp; [[Carol Lee Flinders|Carol Flinders]] (1989). ''[[The Making of a Teacher|The making of a teacher: Conversations with Eknath Easwaran]]'' (see article). Petaluma, CA: Nilgiri Press. {{ISBN|978-0-915132-54-6}} (p. 148: "On the evening of Monday, January 3, 1968, 2000 LSB had standing room only for the several hundred Berkeley students who had registered for The Theory and Practice of Meditation (Religious Studies 138X, four units' credit; instructor, Eknath Easwaran). To anyone's knowledge, it was the first accredited course on meditation offered by any university in the United States - or, for that matter, in the world.&amp;nbsp;...  For ten Monday nights, Easwaran sat atop the black veneer of the demonstration table and lectured on the ancient mystical teachings of the Indian spiritual tradition. Required texts included Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and Sidney Spencer's Mysticism in World Religion.")[https://books.google.com/books?id=YsgkdFk4XWYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=easwaran+making+of+a+teacher&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=religious%20studies&amp;f=false (quote viewable online)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yoga Journal: Yoga Luminaries http://www.yogajournal.com/wisdom/1192&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is an eight-point program intended for the "spiritual growth" of the practitioner. The first step in the program involves meditating on a text passage, and since the 1990s the method as a whole has come to be known as "Passage Meditation" (not Easwaran's term). The book has been frequently reprinted and translated into 14 languages. It is reported that more than 200,000 copies were sold in the period of 1978 to 2001.

The first edition of the book had the full title ''Meditation; commonsense directions for an uncommon life'' (1978). A second edition in 1991 was subtitled ''a simple eight-point program for translating spiritual ideals into daily life'', and a third, revised edition of the book was published posthumously as ''Passage Meditation; Bringing the Deep Wisdom of the Heart Into Daily Life'' (2008).

A fourth, revised edition was published as ''Passage Meditation – A Complete Spiritual Practice: Train Your Mind and Find a Life that Fulfills'' (2016). The fourth edition included a new part, not contained in earlier editions, with approximately 80 pages of "Questions and Answers" to numerous questions about meditation (pp.&amp;nbsp;182–264).

==Topics covered==
All editions of ''Passage Meditation'' contain a chapter dedicated to each of the eight practices or "points" of Easwaran's method of meditation. Each edition also contains a preface by the author in which he explains how he discovered the passage meditation method.

=== Method ===
Meditating on a passage is the first point in Easwaran's eight point program of Passage Meditation, and he recommends practicing it for 30 minutes each day on first rising. The other seven points are to be woven in at various times throughout the day or week. Each of the book's eight main chapters are dedicated to explaining one of the eight points:

# Meditation on a passage
# Repetition of a mantram (mantra, or prayer word)
# Slowing down
# One-pointed attention
# Training the senses
# Putting others first
# Spiritual fellowship
# Spiritual reading

{{Eknath Easwaran}}'''Meditation on a passage''' involves silent, focused repetition during meditation of memorized selections from scriptures of the world and writings of great mystics. According to Easwaran, the practice of meditating on a specific passage of text (Easwaran suggests the [[Make Me an Instrument of Your Peace|Prayer of Saint Francis]] or [[Psalm 23]] as examples&lt;ref&gt;Easwaran (2008), ''Passage Meditation'', p. 37. (see bibliography section)&lt;/ref&gt;) has the effect of eventually transforming "character, conduct, and consciousness." The term passage is chosen to describe a spiritually-inspired text that one meditates on, during an extended period of time set aside for meditation, as compared to a mantram (or mantra). Easwaran collected an anthology of selections from the world's spiritual texts, [[God Makes the Rivers to Flow]], for use in meditation.

'''Repetition of a mantram'''. Easwaran describes a mantram as a short, powerful spiritual formula which can be repeated, at any time during the day or night, to call up the best and deepest in ourselves,&lt;ref&gt;Eknath Easwaran (2008). ''The Mantram Handbook'', Tomales, CA: Nilgiri, p. 12. {{ISBN|978-1-58638-028-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and help to  slow down, to become more one-pointed, and to put others first.&lt;ref&gt;Easwaran (2008), ''The Mantram Handbook'', p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slowing Down''' is an important spiritual discipline. Living faster and faster gives no time for inner reflection or sensitivity to others, making our lives tense, insecure, inefficient, and superficial. Slowing down helps achieve freedom of action, good relations with others, health and vitality, calmness of mind, and the ability to grow.

'''One-pointed attention''' helps to unify consciousness and deepen concentration. Training the mind to give full attention to one thing at a time, whether it is in science or the arts or sports or a profession, is a basic requirement for achieving a goal.

'''Training the senses''' means freeing the mind from the tyranny of likes and dislikes so as to "live in freedom", "live intentionally"

'''Putting others first'''. Dwelling on ourselves builds a wall between ourselves and others. Those who keep thinking about their needs, their wants, their plans, their ideas, cannot help becoming lonely and insecure. As human beings, it is our nature to be part of a whole, to live in a context where personal relationships are supportive and close.

'''Spiritual Fellowship''' with people whose companionship is elevating, and working together for a selfless goal without expecting any reward or recognition, augment and enhance the individual's capacities.

Easwaran says that the eight points, though they may at first seem unrelated, are closely linked. "Quieting your mind in morning meditation, for instance, will help your efforts to slow down at work, and slowing down at work will, in turn, improve your meditation&amp;nbsp;... Unless you practice all of them, you cannot progress safely and far".&lt;ref&gt;Easwaran (2008). ''Passage Meditation'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Passage Meditation does not require adherence to any particular religion or belief.&lt;ref&gt;Monika M. Rodman, ''Passage Meditation: An Invitation to Drink Deeply of Scripture and the Saints' Great Prayers''.  {{cite web |url=http://www.christianspracticingyoga.com/passage.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430234735/http://www.christianspracticingyoga.com/passage.htm |archivedate=2007-04-30 |df= }}  (accessed 18 Oct 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AA Meditators, ''Passage Meditation &amp; the Eleventh Step''.[http://www.meditationandrecovery.org/Documents/11thStep+Meditation%20print%20booklet%201c.pdf] (accessed 18 Oct 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Questions and Answers===
The fourth edition (published in 2016) also contains about 80 pages dedicated to answering numerous questions about how to practice the program.

==Influence, research, use==
Workers in professional fields, as well as writers of popular books, have cited or been influenced by the passage meditation program.&lt;ref&gt;Henri J. M. Nouwen (1992).

(NB: Plante cites the program as derived from Easwaran, 1978/1991; he also included a "case example" for application to psychotherapy practice)&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, the passage meditation program has been included among resources for complementary and alternative medicine.&lt;ref name=rakel2005&gt;David Rakel &amp; Nancy Faass (2006).

Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press. {{ISBN|978-1-60094-001-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several empirical research studies have examined the effects on health professionals and college undergraduates from receiving training in the Passage Meditation (PM) program. Peer-reviewed research, published in professional psychology and health journals, has shown that following the passage meditation program reduces stress&lt;ref name="pmid16881779"&gt;Doug Oman, John Hedberg, and [[Carl E. Thoresen]] (2006). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?DB=pubmed&amp;term=16881779 "Passage meditation reduces perceived stress in health professionals: A randomized, controlled trial"], ''[[Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology]]'' [Washington, DC: [[American Psychological Association]]] v74 n4 pp&amp;nbsp;714–719 Aug 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and increases confidence in tasks such as caregiving&lt;ref name=pmid18987085&gt;Doug Oman, T.

These studies mostly used [[randomized controlled trial|randomized]] methods. Like much recent research on [[Health applications and clinical studies of meditation|meditation]] (e.g., on [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness meditation]]), research studies on Passage Meditation have neither postulated nor claimed to infer the operation of supernatural or other non-natural, non-psychological processes.&lt;ref name=fof2007/&gt; Research on Passage Meditation through early 2007 was reviewed in chapter 6 of ''Spirit, science and health: How the spiritual mind fuels physical wellness''.&lt;ref name=fof2007&gt;Tim Flinders, Doug Oman, and [[Carol Lee Flinders|Carol Flinders]] (2007).

The '''Queen of Angels Foundation''' is an association of lay faithful of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] dedicated to fostering devotion to [[Mary, Mother of Jesus]]. The Foundation is a volunteer group of lay men and women who "...strive together in a common endeavor to foster a more perfect life for themselves and their community by promoting reverence for the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], in whose name, as Our Lady of the Angels, the City and Archdiocese of Los Angeles were founded..." and whom Catholics revere as Queen of Heaven and [[Empress of the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thequeenofangels.com/foundation/our-mission/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Queen of Angels Foundation is the official sponsor of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Archdiocese of Los Angeles]]' annual celebration of the [[Los Angeles|City of Los Angeles]]' founding. This event takes place in Downtown Los Angeles on the last Saturday of August.

The Foundation was launched in February 2011 in [[Los Angeles, California]] as a [[Roman Catholic Marian Movement]] by layman [[Mark Anchor Albert]]. Membership is open to all practising Catholics, and educational and devotional meetings for the benefit of members are held monthly. The Foundation enjoys tax-exemption as a California Nonprofit Religious Corporation.

The Queen of Angels Foundation was founded in February 2011 by attorney and philanthropist [[Mark Anchor Albert]]. It is a lay association of the Roman Catholic Church and is also a recognized tax-exempted religious organization .

==Objectives and Mission==
===Objectives===
The Queen of Angeles Foundation has stated as its objectives:
1) To make known the Catholic faith before all the world,
2) To invoke the healing power of the Holy Spirit to rally the Family of God to support the people and clergy of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles,
3) To demonstrate obedience and fidelity to the wishes of the Popes,
4) To entreat the blessing of God upon our City, County, and Archdiocese of Los Angeles, and
5) To foster interreligious and ecumenical outreach to all members of the multicultural community of Los Angeles.

===Mission===
The Foundation seeks to educate and evangelize the public regarding Our Lady of the Angels, the Catholic heritage of Los Angeles, as well as foster devotion to the Archangels and Guardian Angels. By doing so, the Foundation hopes to foster a more perfect life for its members, deepening their bond to Christ and the Church through Mary, the Mother of God.
To further that end, the Foundation’s members contribute their time, talent, and treasure to organization of an annual Procession, Mass, and Feast in honor of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] on the Saturday nearest September 4, the Feast of Our Lady of the Angels and the anniversary of the founding of the [[Los Angeles|City of Los Angeles]], in the absence of any current comparable observance.

==Spirituality==
According to the Catholic Church’s ''Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy'', “…Popular devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary is an important and universal ecclesial phenomenon. Its expressions are multifarious and its motivation very profound, deriving as it does from the People of God's faith in, and love for, Christ, the Redeemer of mankind, and from an awareness of the salvific mission that God entrusted to Mary of Nazareth, because of which she is mother not only of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, but also of mankind in the order of grace.” The primary purpose and charism of the Queen of Angels Foundation is to foster greater devotion to [[Christ the King]] and [[Titles of Mary#Devotional_titles|Our Lady of the Angels]] in hopes of enriching the spiritual lives and deepening the faith of Catholics everywhere. The Foundation's main activity is an annual [[procession]], Mass, and feast held on the Saturday nearest 4 September which is the Feast of Our Lady of the Angels as well as the anniversary of the founding of the City of Los Angeles.

===Marian Spirituality &amp; Apologetics===
The Queen of Angels Foundation particular charism of Marian devotion is in keeping with the official teaching of the Roman Catholic Church on the Blessed Virgin Mary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/faith/teachings/marymenu.htm] EWTN website, Overview of Official Catholic Teaching on the Blessed Virgin Mary&lt;/ref&gt;

===Processions===
[[File:Belarus Eucharistic Procession.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] Procession in Belarus]]
Processions have historically played a significant role in the liturgical and spiritual life of Christians throughout the world. In every culture, public anniversaries, triumphant heroes, religious festivals, and innumerable other events have been marked by parades of local leadership and activists — and participated in by the viewers. In this way, the entire community is able to reaffirm its values and traditions, while inspiring onlookers with a sense of purpose.

Although the first Christian processions took place firmly within the context of the Liturgy (Introit, Offertory, and Gospel), they soon moved out-of-doors. {{citation needed|date=March 2011}} The type of prayer called “litany” today was expressly designed for these functions, wherein the Church would offer prayers for all degrees of folk within both Church and State, invoking the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary and various saints. In periods of plague or famine, processions bearing saints’ relics would be held, begging Heaven for an end to the calamity.  The [[Rituale Romanum]] (the latest edition of which is called in English simply “The Rites”) gives extensive instructions regarding processions. They are distinguished as “Ordinary Processions”: for feast days, such as Candlemas, [[Palm Sunday]], [[Holy Week]], [[Rogation Days]], [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]], and other feasts as dictated by local custom; as well as for various “Extraordinary Processions”.

Prior to the [[Protestant Reformation]], this “culture of processions” was universal in the Church, both East and West. But the first Protestants often rejected processions as “Popish” idolatry and superstition .{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} So while in traditionally Catholic parts of Europe, Latin America, and certain parts of Asia and Africa, the old customs hold forth (and are often major tourist draws to localities that still have them), they died out in such Protestant regions as Scotland and England, and were forbidden in Ireland by the British authorities. In time, Catholics in those lands — and the countries overseas where they settled, forgot the old ways. Where processions were required by the Missal, as at Candlemas, Palm Sunday, and Corpus Christi, they were held in the churchyard or even restricted to marching around the interior of the Church; they might even be done away with altogether.

[[Catholic Emancipation]] in Protestant Europe, and the presence of ethnic Catholics in North America, led to a gradual revival of processions in some areas — but they were often considered unusual, and looked at with some suspicion by “native” Catholics, despite, for example, [[Pope Pius XI]] call for processions honoring the new [[Feast of Christ the King]]. The liturgical movement did a great deal of work expanding the use of processions prior to the [[Second Vatican Council]]. Following the Council, however, many places, even in Catholic countries, abandoned some or all of them, or at least cut them back in number or length.

[[File:2012 Grand Marian Procession, Downtown Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|left|2012 Grand Marian Procession through Downtown Los Angeles]]
In 2001, to correct these abuses (and many others which had afflicted popular piety since the Council), the Catholic Church's [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]] issued a '''Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20020513_vers-direttorio_en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623013300/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20020513_vers-direttorio_en.html |archivedate=23 June 2012 }} Roman Catholic Church, Congregation for Divine Worship and Discipline of the Sacraments, December 2001, ''Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy: Principles and Guidelines''&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout that document, the use (and revival) of processions for various Church festivals is called for, and an entire section devoted to processions alone, in which their importance for all Catholics is underlined.

In an attempt to revive the custom of religious processions, in September 2011 the Queen of Angels Foundation inaugurated an annual '''Grand Marian Procession''' in the heart of [[Downtown Los Angeles]]' historic core.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thequeenofangels.com/wp-content/media/tidings-online20110906.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thequeenofangels.com/wp-content/media/marian_procession_seeks_prayer_for_los_angeles_on_citys_birthday___ewtn_n.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This yearly procession, held on the last Saturday of August and intended to coincide with the anniversary of the founding of the City of Los Angeles, begins at the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels (Los Angeles)|Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angel]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, where a Rosary and Mass in honour of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Blessed Virgin Mary]] are offered, and concludes outside of the parish of [[La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora Reina de los Angeles]], part of the [[Los Angeles Plaza Historic District]], better known as "La Placita".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thequeenofangels.com/wp-content/media/tidings-online20110902.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent years have seen the involvement and participation of numerous chivalric, fraternal, and religious orders, parishes, lay groups, political figures, as well as other religious and civic organizations.

===Prayers===

Central to the spirituality of the Queen of Angels Foundation is devotion to [[Mary, Mother of Jesus]]. According to Catholic teaching, Mary played a unique and important role in the ministry of her son, [[Jesus Christ]], and thus, in God’s plan of salvation for the entire world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15464b.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen of Angels Foundation places great importance on [[Marian spirituality]] and devotion as a means of deepening one’s understanding of and relationship with Christ. Marian prayers such as the [[Rosary]], the [[Angelus]], various intercessory prayers, and the devout use of holy cards  are given special importance.

==Catholic chivalry==
In addition to its many spiritual aims, the Queen of Angels Foundation also seeks to promote the revival and deeper understanding of Catholic [[chivalry]] and its role in the life of the church and the community. Many members of the Queen of Angels Foundation board of directors are also members of various [[chivalric order]]s, including [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], [[Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem]], [[Order of St. Gregory]], [[Order of St. Sylvester]], as well as [[fraternal order]]s such as the [[Knights of Peter Claver]], and the [[Knights of Columbus]].

In the [[Middle Ages]] and today, there were many who lived by the code of chivalry outside of the various orders. Some of these knightly orders date back to the days when [[crusaders]] sought to reclaim the [[Holy Land]]; others are of more recent origin but still seek to perpetuate the same spirit of service in the present day.

==Civic and Community Engagement==

The Queen of Angels Foundation, in addition to fostering religious devotion, also seeks to "celebrate the accomplishments and diversity"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thequeenofangels.com/foundation/our-mission/&lt;/ref&gt; of the City of Los Angeles. Through its annual '''Grand Marian Procession''' the Foundation also marks Los Angeles' official founding (on September 4, 1781) as a city named in honour of '''Mary, Queen of Angels''' (El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora de Los Ángeles). "For approximately the first 100 years of the City’s history, citizens marked Los Angeles’ founding through processions and parades calling for God’s blessings and protection for our civic and religious leaders and inhabitants. By re-inaugurating this civic birthday celebration and ancient religious observance, we hope to honor the Southland’s history and heritage, celebrate our City’s accomplishments and diversity, and unite our multicultural community to face our common challenges."

In recognition of its efforts to engage the local community in fostering civic pride, the [[Los Angeles City Council]] officially recognized the Queen of Angels Foundation in a formal commendation awarded in August 2012.

Civic leaders such as former Los Angeles mayor [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] and City Council members [[Tom LaBonge]] and [[Jan Perry]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eapCPDwRdRI&lt;/ref&gt; among others, have publicly expressed support for the work of the Queen of Angels Foundation. The Foundation has also received the support of the members of Los Angeles consular corps, with official delegations from the Croatian, Filipino, Lithuanian, Polish, Slovakian, and Spanish consulates general taking part in the 2012 Grand Marian Procession and Mass.

==Logo and Heraldic Crest==
[[File:QoA logo.jpg|thumb|right|Logo of the Queen of Angels Foundation]]
The corporate logo of the Queen of Angels Foundation consists of a crown with seven stars accompanied by the Latin motto, “Ave Maria, Regina Angelorum” (or “Hail Mary, Queen of the Angels").

Images of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] often depict her with a crown of twelve stars in reference to an allusion found in the twelfth chapter of the Apocalypse of St. John: “A great sign appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.”

The iconography of the seven stars is intended to symbolize several important attributes of the Blessed Virgin Mary . The star itself, apart from the number of stars presented, is a traditional sign of Mary.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The star figures in many of the titles of Mary, including La Madonna della Stella, Star of the New Evangelization, Star of the Sea, Star of Jacob, Morning Star, and Fixed Star, to name a few. The crown of stars depicted in the Queen of Angels Foundation logo is a Crown of Immortality, reflecting the Catholic teaching of Queenship of Mary.  That there are seven stars above her crown also call to mind the key role Mary played in Salvation History. The seven stars on the Crown of Immortality of Our Lady of the Angels also signify the Seven Corporal Works of Mercy as well as the Seven Spiritual [[Works of Mercy]], the Seven [[Gifts of the Holy Spirit]], the [[Seven Virtues]], the [[Seven Joys of Mary]] and the [[Seven Sorrows of Mary]].

==The Archdiocese of Los Angeles==
As a devotional society resident within the [[Archdiocese of Los Angeles]] the Queen of Angels Foundation maintains a close, cooperative relationship with the Archdiocese and strict allegiance to the Archbishop of Los Angeles and the wider [[Magisterium]] of the Roman Catholic Church. [[José Horacio Gómez]] succeeded [[Roger Cardinal Mahony]] as Archbishop of Los Angeles in March 2011. The Archbishop is assisted by six auxiliary bishops five of whom oversee a separate geographical portion of the Archdiocese known as a pastoral region. The current auxiliary bishops are [[Edward William Clark|Edward W. Clark]], [[Thomas John Curry|Thomas J. Curry]], [[Alexander Salazar]], [[Joseph Vincent Brennan|Joseph V. Brennan]], [[David G. O'Connell]], and [[Robert Barron (bishop)|Robert E. Barron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.la-archdiocese.org/AuxiliaryBishops/Pages/default.aspx|title=ADLA - Auxiliary Bishops|website=www.la-archdiocese.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board of directors==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4228">'''Reender Kranenborg''' (born 1942) was an editor of the magazine ''Religious Movement in the Netherlands'' published by the institute of [[religious studies]] of the [[Vrije Universiteit|Free University in Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;Religieuze Bewegingen in Nederland nr. 22 1991 Published by VU publishing House Colofon&lt;br&gt;Eindredacteur Dr. R. Kranenborg&lt;br&gt; Instituut voor Godsdienstwetenschap&lt;br&gt;Vrije Universiteit&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his Phd. in the theological faculty about the subject of [[Self-realization]]. He stated in the dissertation that he had attempted to research the subject following the norms of religious studies, not a theological one.&lt;ref&gt;Zelfverwerkelijking: oosterse religies binnen een westerse subcultuur (1974) uitgegeven door J.H Kok Kampen Ph.D. dissertation page 8&lt;br&gt;Misschien zullen velen verwachten in een studie zoals deze, die plaatsvindt binnen de theologische fakulteit een theologisch slothoofdstuk aan te treffen. Men zal dit echter tevergeefs zoeken want deze studie wil godsdienstwetenschappelijk zijn [..]&lt;/ref&gt;

He had, until his retirement, a seat at the ''Comitato Scientifico'' (scientific committee)  of the [[CESNUR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cesnur.org/about.htm|title=About CESNUR|publisher=[[CESNUR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ruth Garrett Millikan''' (born 1933) is a leading [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]] of [[philosophy of biology|biology]], [[philosophy of psychology|psychology]], and [[philosophy of language|language]] who spent most of her career at the [[University of Connecticut]].

==Education and career==

Millikan earned her AB from [[Oberlin College]] in 1955. At [[Yale University]] she studied under [[Wilfrid Sellars]]. Although W. Sellars  left for the [[University of Pittsburgh]] midway through Millikan's doctorate, she stayed at Yale and earned her PhD in 1969.  She and [[Paul Churchland]] are often considered leading proponents of "right wing" (i.e., individualistic) Sellarsianism.

Millikan taught half-time at the [[University of Michigan]] from 1993-1996,&lt;ref&gt;http://philosophy.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/365/2014/02/Millikan-cv.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; but otherwise spent her entire career at the [[University of Connecticut]], where she is now [[professor emerita]]. She is married to American psychologist and cognitive scientist [[Donald Shankweiler]].&lt;ref&gt;http://philosophy.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/365/2014/02/Millikan-cv.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

She was awarded the [[Jean Nicod Prize]] and gave the ''Jean Nicod Lectures'' in [[Paris]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.institutnicod.org/seminaires-colloques/conferences-et-prix-jean-nicod/archives/?lang=fr&lt;/ref&gt;  She was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2014 &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amacad.org/multimedia/pdfs/alphalist2014.pdf American Academy of Arts and Sciences 2014 fellows]&lt;/ref&gt; and received, in 2017, both the [[Nicholas Rescher Prize for Systematic Philosophy]] from the [[University of Pittsburgh]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pitt.edu/~rescher/Rescher%20Prize.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Rolf Schock Prize]] in Logic and Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rolfschockprizes.se/en-GB/pristagare2017/logikochfilosofi.55.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==

Millikan is most famous for the view which, in her 1989 paper of the same name, she refers to as "Biosemantics".&lt;ref&gt;http://philosophy.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/365/2014/02/Biosemantics-Oxford-Handbook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Biosemantics is a theory about something philosophers often refer to as "[[intentionality]]".  Intentionality is the phenomenon of things being 'about' other things, paradigm cases being thoughts and sentences.  A belief of mine that you will do my chores for me, for example, is about you and about my chores.  The same is true of a corresponding desire, intention or spoken or written command.

In general, the goal of a theory of intentionality is to explain the phenomenon – things being 'about' other things – in other, more informative, terms.  Such a theory aims to give an account of what this 'aboutness' consists in.  Just as chemistry offers the claim "Water is H2O" as a theory of what water consists in, so biosemantics aims for a constitutive account of intentionality.  Such an account, Millikan stresses, must deal adequately with such hallmarks of mentality as error, confusion, and what looks like standing in a relation (the 'aboutness' relation) to something that doesn't exist.  For example:  one 'sees' the stick is bent, but realizes otherwise after pulling it from the water; the inexperienced prospector thinks he's struck it rich, but he's holding a lump of pyrite ("fool's gold"); the field marshal thinks about the next day's battle, the child wants to ride a unicorn, and the phrase "the greatest prime" is somehow 'about' a number that cannot possibly exist (there's a simple proof for this).

As the name hints, Millikan's theory explains intentionality in terms that are broadly 'biological' or [[teleological]]. Specifically, she explains intentionality using the explanatory resources of natural selection:  what thoughts and sentences and desires are 'about' is ultimately elucidated by reference to what has been selected and what it has been selected for (i.e., what advantage it conferred on ancestors who possessed it). Where this selection is non-intentional, then what it is for is its 'proper function'.&lt;ref&gt;Millikan, Ruth Garrett, Language: A Biological Model, Oxford, 2005, 228pp, $29.95 (pbk), {{ISBN|0199284776}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Equally important is what might be called the co-evolution of producer-mechanisms and consumer-mechanisms.  Millikan refers to the intertwined selection histories of these mechanisms to explain the hallmarks of mentality and to offer a wide range of positions on various matters of dispute in the philosophy of mind and language.

In her article "Naturalist Reflections on Knowledge", Millikan defends the position that the justification of true beliefs through an explanation in accordance with evolution constitutes knowledge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13145">The '''Sardica paschal table''' or '''Sardica document''' is a document from a [[Latin language|Latin]] manuscript of the 7th/8th century AD.  It is a copy in Latin translation of the creed of the Eastern Christian bishops attending the [[Council of Sardica]] who, fearing that their deliberations would be dominated by Western bishops, met separately at [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]].  Appended to the creed and anathemas is a table of [[Paschal full moon]] dates, given as dates in the [[Julian calendar]], for the years 328 to 357, together with a list of dates of 14 [[Nisan]] in the Jewish calendar, also referred to the Julian calendar, for the years 328 to 343, the year of the Council.  The calendrical information contained in the document has been used by scholars in tracing the history of the [[computus]] and of the [[Hebrew calendar]].

==The manuscript and the contents of the document==

The Sardica paschal table is a part of Codex Verona LX(58), or, more fully, MS Verona, Biblioteca Capitolare LX(58). It was first published by [[Eduard Schwartz]] in his ''Christliche und jüdische Ostertafeln'' (Berlin, 1905),&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Schwartz, ''Christliche und jüdische Ostertafeln, (Abhandlungen der königlichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen).  Philologisch-Historische Klasse.  Neue Folge, Band viii'', Berlin, 1905.&lt;/ref&gt; where the manuscript in which it occurs was called Codex Verona 60. The manuscript has 126 leaves of vellum measuring 27&amp;nbsp;cm by 20&amp;nbsp;cm.  It is written in Latin uncial script that [[paleography|paleographers]] have dated to about AD 700.&lt;ref&gt;W. Telfer, "The Codex Verona LX(58)", ''Harvard Theological Review'', 36(3), (July, 1943), pages 169-246.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sardica document occurs on folios 79 verso to 80 verso.&lt;ref&gt;Sacha Stern, Calendar and Community:  A History of the Jewish Calendar Second Century BCE&amp;nbsp;– Tenth Century CE, Oxford, 2001, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Telfer, "Codex Verona LX(58)", pp. 181-182.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is apparently a copy of a [[Christian]] document written at the time of the [[Council of Sardica]] (AD 343).  It contains the creed and anathemas drawn up by the eastern bishops meeting at the council, followed by a list of Christian "Passovers", that is, Julian calendar dates of the 14th day (the Paschal full moon) of the Paschal lunar month, the Sunday following which is Easter.  This table is preceded by a list of Julian calendar dates of 14 Nisan observed by the Jewish community in some eastern Mediterranean city (possibly [[Antioch]]).  The Jewish dates are captioned'' Quibus supputationibus faciant Iudei pascha''.  The Christian dates are captioned ''Quo numero faciamus nos Christiani''.

The dates as they stand are somewhat garbled. Schwartz proposed emendations,&lt;ref&gt;E. Schwartz, ''Ostertafeln'', pp. 121-125.&lt;/ref&gt; and these emendations have been reviewed and criticized recently by Sacha Stern&lt;ref&gt;Sacha Stern, ''Calendar and Community:  A History of the Jewish Calendar Second Century BCE&amp;nbsp;– Tenth Century CE'', Oxford, 2001, pp. 127-129.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[University College London]].

A striking feature of the Jewish dates is that, for the 16 years listed, all the Passovers are in the Julian month of March.  This is clearly inconsistent with the modern [[Hebrew calendar]].  It also corroborates the complaints of 3rd and 4th-century Christian computists that some Jews held Passover before the spring equinox.

==The text of the document==
[[Image:Sardica doc 1a.jpg|thumb|right|The Sardica paschal table, from MS Verona, Biblioteca Capitolare LX(58). The words at the top are ''quo tempore conveni magna synodus in civitate nicea''. Before the first line of figures are the words ''quibus supputationibus faciunt Iudei pascha''. Near the bottom of the left hand column of dates are the words ''quo numero facimus nos Christiani.'' Image from E. Schwartz,''Christliche und jüdische Ostertafeln'' (Berlin, 1905)]]

The document, as published and emended by Schwartz in 1905 here follows.  The leftmost column indicates the AD year assigned by Schwartz.  The second and third columns transcribe the tables found in the manuscript.  In these columns, square and angle brackets indicate Schwartz's emendations.  In the numerals, a square bracket emendation indicates a character or characters that Schwartz thought should be deleted, while an angle bracket emendation indicates where Schwartz thought characters should be added.  A note in square brackets with the letters MS indicate that the entire preceding word is Schwartz's emendation, and the word in brackets is the original.

'''De pascha autem scribsimus nobis XXX annos, quoniam XXX annos fecit dominus noster in carne super terram, pascha autem facta est XXX anno XXV die Martii mensis, computatur autem primus primus''' {{sic}}&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz used the German word ''so'' instead of the Latin word ''sic''.&lt;/ref&gt; '''annus triginta annorum scriptorum in comp&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;tationibus in quibus faciunt Iudei phascha''' {{sic}} '''a prima indictione que facta est sub Constantino''' [328],''' quo tempore conveni&lt;t&gt; magna synodus in civitate Nicaea, cum diu quaererent episcopi de phascha ut computetur.  prima indictio''' [''indici'' MS]&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz used ''Hs'' ("Handschrift") instead of ''MS''.&lt;/ref&gt;'''a primo anno computationis, et prima indictio inputata post quintam decimam est XVI anno positus in conputatione annorum pasche.  a primo''' [must mean ''ab undecimo''.  A and IA were reversed in the original]&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz:  muss heissen ab undecimo, im Original waren A und IA verwechselt.  Schwartz means that the numeral "primo", which in the Greek original was represented by the letter alfa, was written in place of "undecimo", which in the original was represented by letters iota alfa.  Stern ignores this obscure comment. Actually Schwartz comment better applies to the subsequent "primus".&lt;/ref&gt;  '''anno computatur numerus iste usque ad XXX annum qui est primus mensis Aprilis.'''

::This text translates approximately as follows: " We wrote for ourselves thirty years of paschal dates, as our Lord spent thirty years in flesh on the Earth. In the 30th year Passover falls in the XXV day of March. The first of the years listed before the 30 years in the computed dates in which Jews have Passover is computed starting from the first indiction occurred under Constantine. In this time a large synod met in Nicea town, as bishops had required for a long time that the dates of Passover be computed. The first indiction (starts) from the first year of the computed data and subsequent indiction is included after the fifteenth in year XVI of the computed Passover years. This number (=Passover date), which is the first of April(= April 11th, according to Schwartz' comment), is computed from the year I up to XXX".&lt;ref&gt;Note that XXV day of March is a copying error for XXII day of March, the correct number reported in the table. The second "primus" has been interpreted as a copying error for "prius".&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Possiti '''[sic]''' autem sunt distinctiones numeri Iudeorum nobis sic quibus supputationibus faciant Iudei pascha'''&lt;ref&gt;This sentence is badly damaged. In particular the abbreviation "NB" probably should not be interpreted as "nobis" (as usual) but as "notabitur". In such case the meaning is approximately: "The different dates of Jews are also exposed. So it will be noted with which computed dates Jews have Passover".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Et Reliqui XIIII anni, quo numero facimus nos Christiani'''&lt;ref&gt;This note explains that the dates of Passover of the first 16 years were derived from the dates of the Jews passover by adding 30 days any time the date occurred before March 21st, while the 14 years remaining up to 30 were computed directly by the bishops in AD 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calibration of the document==
Since the document clearly states that the years run "from the first [[indiction]] that was under Constantine" [327-328], Schwartz's assignment of the years seems valid.  Sacha Stern has analyzed the Jewish dates, and found that nine of the sixteen dates coincide with the 14th day of a lunar month if the first day of the month is taken to be the day of the lunar [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]].&lt;ref&gt;Sacha Stern,'' Calendar and Community'', pp. 124-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance for the history of the Rabbinic calendar==
Sacha Stern takes the Sardica document as evidence that the Jews referred to in the document (which he tentatively identifies as those of Antioch) used a computed, or partially computed, calendar with  system of intercalations that kept 14 Nisan with the limits of Julian March.  Since this differs from what can be known of the Jewish calendar in other cities, he concludes "the Jewish calendar could vary significantly from one community to the next."&lt;ref&gt;Sacha Stern, ''Calendar and Community'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance for the history of the computus==
The Sardica document, if it is accurate in its report of the dates of 14 Nisan for the Jewish community in some eastern Mediterranean city, corroborates the complaints of Christian writers of the 3rd and 4th centuries AD that some Jews set 14 Nisan before the spring equinox.  This was one of the chief reasons given by Christians for their attempts to develop an independent calculation to determine the date of the Easter festival—to compute, in effect, a "Christian Nisan", and set Easter accordingly—rather than relying on information from Jewish neighbors about when Jewish Nisan would fall.  Additionally, if Schwartz's emendations are accepted, they show the dates following a pattern in which the Christian dates for Nisan 14 agree with the Jewish dates whenever the latter fall on March 21 or later.  Both emended columns employ a constant epact of 11 for the difference between the Julian and lunar years:  Each year's date is 11 days earlier than the preceding year's, or 19 days later if the 11-day deduction would result in a Christian date earlier than March 21, or in a Jewish date earlier than March 1.&lt;ref&gt;Mosshammer, Alden A.,'' The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era'', Oxford, 2008, pp. 184-186.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ZenBuddhism}}
{{Nihongo|'''''Tenzo Kyōkun'''''|典座教訓|}}, usually rendered in English as '''''Instructions for the Cook''''', is an important essay written by [[Dōgen]], the founder of [[Zen Buddhism]]'s [[Sōtō school]] in Japan.

==Title and content==

While the title suggests the scope is limited to simple cooking instructions, Ekiho Miyazaki, an abbot of the Sōtō school's head temple [[Eihei-ji]], summarizes the work's importance when he writes, "''Instructions for the Cook'' are instructions for life".&lt;ref&gt;Warner et al., 10&lt;/ref&gt; The work was written in 1237, ten years after Dōgen's return from his time in [[Song Dynasty]] [[China]]. At this time he was practicing at the monastery he had founded four years earlier, [[Kōshōhōrin-ji]].&lt;ref name="Baroni, 344"&gt;Baroni, 344&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Warner et al., 14"&gt;Warner et al., 14&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he wrote several of his best known works such as [[Bendōwa]], [[Fukan Zazengi]], and [[Genjōkōan]]. However, the language and style in the ''Instructions'' are regarded as more concrete and straightforward than these other popular works.&lt;ref name="Warner et al., 14"/&gt; ''Instructions for the Cook'' is included as the first part of the [[Eihei Shingi]], or ''Rules of Purity for [[Eihei-ji]]''.&lt;ref name="Baroni, 344"/&gt;&lt;ref name=renpo/&gt;

Renpō Niwa, a former abbot of [[Eihei-ji]], divides the texts into five parts. The first part is the preface in which Dōgen emphasizes the importance of the work of the [[tenzo]], or head cook. He asserts that the position is only suitable for experienced monks with a certain deep degree of understanding of zen practice. The next section describes the actual work the tenzo must carry out, as well as the attitude with which it should be undertaken. The third part includes instructions for serving, as well as an account of Dōgen's famous encounters with two monks serving as tenzo while he was visiting China. He acknowledges that these meetings had a deep and lasting impact on his understanding of Buddhism, and they thus ultimately helped shape Sōtō Zen in Japan. Next, Dōgen focuses on the need for the tenzo to act without any thought of discrimination or duality. In the last section, the discussion of the tenzo's attitude is concluded with a discussion of the Three Minds (''Sanshin'', 三心), a set of three ideals for Zen practice.&lt;ref name=renpo&gt;Warner et al., 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allusions to Kōan==
Dōgen's essay makes numerous allusions to other works, especially [[kōan]]s. One such reference is to a kōan attributed to [[Dongshan Shouchu]] that appears in both the [[Gateless Gate]] and the [[Blue Cliff Record]].&lt;ref name=hemp&gt;Warner et al., 38&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Dongshan is asked, "What is Buddha"?, to which he replies, "Three pounds of hemp".&lt;ref name=hashimoto&gt;Warner et al., 72&lt;/ref&gt; Dōgen mentions the kōan in the opening of the essay while arguing how serious a position [[tenzo]] is, stating that Dongshan had this insight during his time serving as tenzo.&lt;ref&gt;Warner et al., 32&lt;/ref&gt; While hemp may seem unrelated to the kitchen, the Zen scholars [[Shohaku Okumura]] and [[Taigen Dan Leighton]] suggest 'hemp' (麻) may be a mistranslation and that 'sesame' (胡麻) was intended, which makes more sense in the context of cooking.&lt;ref name=hemp/&gt; Dōgen mentions the kōan in order to suggest that the most simple activities, such as working with everyday ingredients, are no different from [[Buddhahood|awakening]] when approached directly and with a clear mind.&lt;ref name=hashimoto/&gt;

Another kōan quoted in the work involves an encounter with the abbot [[Dongshan Liangjie]] and a tenzo at his monastery named [[Xuefeng Yicun]]. In the story, which is taken from the ''Zen en Shingi'' (''Pure Standards of the Zen Garden'', 禅苑清規),&lt;ref&gt;Warner et al., 35&lt;/ref&gt; Xuefeng is cleaning rice when Dongshan asks, "Are you sifting the sand and removing the rice, or sifting the rice and removing the sand"? Xuefeng responds that both are removed at the same time. Dongshan then says, "What will the great assembly eat?" In response to this, Xuefeng overturns the bowl. Dongshan says, "In the future you will go and be scrutinized by someone else". The final line references the fact that Xuefeng ultimately studied under [[Touzi Datong]], Dongshan, and [[Deshan Xuanjian]] before finally receiving [[dharma transmission]]. According to Kōryō Shinno in an essay on the kōans of ''Tenzo Kyōkun'', Xuefeng gives his answer in order to express the [[nondualism]] of his activity. However, Dongshan follows up by reminding him that while his answer demonstrates a grasp on the absolute meaning of his activity, he is forgetting the utility value (i.e. feeding the other practitioners) and thus his apparently absolute understanding is in fact limited. Xuefeng does not grasp this and turns over the rice washing bowl in frustration.&lt;ref&gt;Warner et al., 77-79&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sickness Unto Death''''' ({{lang-da|Sygdommen til Døden}}) is a book written by Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in 1849 under the [[pseudonym]] Anti-Climacus. A work of [[Christian existentialism]], the book is about Kierkegaard's concept of [[Existential despair|despair]], which he equates with the [[Christianity|Christian]] concept of [[sin]], particularly [[original sin]].

==Summary==
Anti-Climacus introduces the book with a reference to [[Gospel of John]] 11.4: "This sickness is not unto death."  This quotation comes from the story of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], in which [[Jesus]] raises a man from the dead.  However, Anti-Climacus raises the question: would not this statement still be true even if Jesus had not raised Lazarus from the dead?  While the human conception of death is the end, the Christian conception of death is merely another stop along the way of the eternal life.  In this way, for the Christian, death is nothing to fear. Instead, the inability to die is what is to be feared. The true "Sickness unto Death," which does not describe physical but spiritual death, which stems from not embracing one's self, is something to fear according to Anti-Climacus.

This sickness unto death is what Kierkegaard calls despair.  According to Kierkegaard, an individual is "in despair" if he does not align himself with [[God]] or God's plan for the self.  In this way, he loses his [[Self (philosophy)|self]], which Kierkegaard defines as the "relation's relating itself to itself in the relation." Kierkegaard defines humanity as the tension between the "finite and infinite", and the "possible and the necessary", and is identifiable with the [[dialectical]] balancing act between these opposing features, the relation. While humans are inherently reflective and self-conscious beings, to become a true self one must not only be conscious of the self but also be conscious of being grounded in love, viz the source of the self in "the power that created it."  When one either denies this self or the power that creates and sustains this self, one is in despair.

There are three kinds of despair presented in the book: being unconscious in despair of having a self, not wanting in despair to be oneself, and wanting in despair to be oneself.  The first of these is described as "inauthentic despair," because this despair is born out of ignorance. In this state, one is unaware that one has a self separate from its finite reality. One does not realize that there is a power that created and continues to create one, and accepts finitude because one is unaware of possibility of being more inherent in selfhood. The second type of despair is refusing to accept the self outside of immediacy; only defining the self by immediate, finite terms. This is the state in which one realizes that one has a self, but wishes to lose this painful awareness by arranging one's finite life so as to make the realization unnecessary. This stage is loosely comparable to Sartre's [[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]. The third type is awareness of the self but refusal to acknowledge one's dependence on love, i.e., the power that created one. In this stage, one accepts the eternal and may or may not acknowledge love, but refuses to accept an aspect of the Self that one in reality is, that is to say, the self that one is in love. Kierkegaard identifies this type of demonic despair as the most heightened form of despair.

To not be in despair is to have reconciled the finite with the infinite, to exist in awareness of one's own self and of love's power.  Specifically, Kierkegaard defines the opposite of despair as [[faith]], which he describes by the following: "In relating itself to itself, and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it."  People commonly ascribe the name "God" to the "power that created" the self, but Anti-Climacus's text is more subtle than this orthodox viewpoint.  Kierkegaard certainly was thinking of God, but what it means to have a personal relation with God, and how God is love are the real subjects of this book.  While the book is, in many ways, a phenomenology of prayer; it is just as much a phenomenology of what a Romantic-despite-himself could offer to the future of human maturity by way of a relational view of the self as grounded in creative love. 

==Relation to other works==
''The Sickness Unto Death'' has strong [[existentialism|existentialist]] themes. For example, the concept of the finite and infinite parts of the human self translate to [[Heidegger]]'s concept of 'facticity' and Sartre's concept of 'transcendence' in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]''. Kierkegaard's thesis is, of course, in other ways profoundly different from Sartre, most obviously because of Kierkegaard's belief that only religious faith can save the soul from despair. This particular brand of existentialism is often called [[Christian existentialism]].

Some have suggested that the opening of the book is an elaborate parody of the often bafflingly cryptic philosophy of [[Georg Wilhelm Hegel]]; however, some scholars, such as [[Gregor Malantschuk]], have suggested otherwise (''Armed Neutrality and An Open Letter'', Simon and Schuster, 1969, pp.&amp;nbsp;65–6 and n. 7 on pp.&amp;nbsp;165–6).

==In popular culture==
* The Polish minimalist composer [[Tomasz Sikorski]] wrote a piece of music inspired by the work, which includes a recitation of Kierkergaard's text.
* The sixteenth episode of the [[anime]] series ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (anime)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', ''[[List of Neon Genesis Evangelion episodes|The Sickness Unto Death, And...]]'', is named after the book. Much of the series' philosophical and psychological subtext is influenced by, and makes reference to, the pessimism of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and the [[existentialism]] of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].
* The [[manga]] ''[[Sickness Unto Death (manga)|The Sickness Unto Death]]'' ("Shi ni Itaru Yamai"), by Asada Hikari, uses Kierkegaard's ideas of despair within a story about multiple personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2013/otakon/10|title= Otakon 2013 Vertical|author=Bamboo Dong|date=2013-08-10|accessdate= 2013-12-13|work= [[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Sickness Unto Foolish Death'' is the sixth song on the original soundtrack for the video game ''[[Silent Hill 3]]'', composed by Japanese musician [[Akira Yamaoka]]. The elements of despair, sin and death are fundamental to the ''Silent Hill'' franchise.
* In the manga ''[[High School of the Dead]]'', [[List of Highschool of the Dead characters#Saeko Busujima|Saeko]] is seen reading this book.
* The band ''[[Typhoon (American band)|Typhoon]]'' has a song titled "The Sickness Unto Death" from the album Hunger and Thirst. The book is also referenced in the song "Caesar," from White Lighter.
* In Episode 5 of the anime "Karen Senki", the character Eleanor references Kierkegaard's ideas comparing her inability to sing as despair.

[[File:Mono_pensador.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Theory of mind in animals is the ability of nonhuman animals to attribute mental states to themselves and others]]
'''Theory of mind in animals''' is an extension to non-human animals of the philosophical and psychological concept of [[Theory of mind|theory of mind (ToM)]], sometimes known as '''mentalisation''' or '''mind-reading'''. It involves an inquiry into whether animals have the ability to attribute [[mental state]]s (such as [[intention]], [[desire (emotion)|desires]], [[role-playing|pretending]], [[knowledge]]) to themselves and others, including recognition that others have mental states that are different from their own.&lt;ref name="Heyes2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Heyes, C.|year=2015|title=Animal mindreading: what's the problem?|pmid=25102928| journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=22|issue=2|pages=313–327|doi=10.3758/s13423-014-0704-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Premack1978"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Premack, D.G.  |author2=Woodruff, G. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1978|title=Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=1 |issue=4| pages=515–526 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00076512}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calarge"/&gt; To investigate this issue experimentally, researchers place animals in situations where their resulting behavior can be interpreted as supporting ToM or not.

The existence of theory of mind in animals is controversial.  On the one hand, one hypothesis proposes that some animals have complex cognitive processes which allow them to attribute mental states to other individuals, sometimes called "mind-reading".  A second, more parsimonious, hypothesis proposes that animals lack these skills and that they depend instead on more simple learning processes such as [[associative learning]];&lt;ref name="Elgier2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Elgier, A.M.|author2=Jakovcevic, A.|author3=Mustaca, A.E.|author4= Bentosela, M.|year=2012|title=Pointing following in dogs: are simple or complex cognitive mechanisms involved?|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=15|issue=6|pages=1111–1119|lastauthoramp=yes|doi=10.1007/s10071-012-0534-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in other words, they are simply behaviour-reading.

Several studies have been designed specifically to test whether animals possess theory of mind by using interspecific or intraspecific communication.  Several taxa have been tested including primates, birds and canines.  Positive results have been found; however, these are often qualified as showing only low-grade ToM, or rejected as not convincing by other researchers.

==History and development==
[[File:In de hangmat.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Much of the early work on ToM in animals focused on the understanding chimpanzees have of human knowledge]]
The term "theory of mind" was originally proposed by Premack and Woodruff in 1978.&lt;ref name="Premack1978" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Towner"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Towner, S.|title=Concept of mind in non-human primates|journal=Bioscience Horizons|year=2010|volume=3|issue=1|pages=96–104|doi=10.1093/biohorizons/hzq011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early studies focused almost entirely on studying if chimpanzees could understand the knowledge of humans.  This approach turned out not to be particularly fruitful and 20 years later, Heyes, reviewing all the extant data, observed that there had been "no substantial progress" in the subject area.&lt;ref name="Heyes1998" /&gt;

A 2000 paper&lt;ref name="Hare2000" /&gt; approached the issue differently by examining competitive foraging behaviour between primates of the same species ([[conspecific]]s).  This led to the rather limited conclusion that "chimpanzees know what conspecifics do and do not see".&lt;ref name="Whiten2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Whiten, A.|year=2013|title=Humans are not alone in computing how others see the world|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=86|issue=2|pages=213–221|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.04.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Next, brain activity in higher primates was studied and as a result, a 2003 study of the human brain suggested that the a functioning ToM system activated three major nodes, the medial prefrontal, superior temporal sulcus, and inferior frontal: the medial prefrontal node handles the mental state of the self, that the superior temporal sulcus detects the behaviour of other animals and analyzes the goals and outcomes of this behaviour, and the inferior frontal region maintains representations of actions and goals.&lt;ref name="Calarge"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Calarge, C.|author2=Andreasen, N.C.|author3=O'Leary, D.S.|year=2003|title=Visualizing how one brain understands another: a PET study of theory of mind|pmid=14594741|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=160|issue=11|pages=1954–1964|lastauthoramp=yes|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.11.1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Penn and Povinelli wrote "there is still little consensus on whether or not nonhuman animals understand anything about unobservable mental states or even what it would mean for a non-verbal animal to understand the concept of a 'mental state'." They went on further to suggest that ToM was "''any'' cognitive system, whether theory-like or not, that predicts or explains the behaviour of another agent by postulating that unobservable inner states particular to the cognitive perspective of that agent causally modulate that agent's behaviour".&lt;ref name="Penn2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Penn, D.C.  |author2=Povinelli, D.J. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007|title=On the lack of evidence that non-human animals possess anything remotely resembling a 'theory of mind'|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume=362|issue=1480 |pages=731–744|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/362/1480/731.full.pdf|doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.2023|pmid=17264056|pmc=2346530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, an article in ''[[Scientific American]]'' acknowledged that dogs are considerably better at using social direction cues (e.g. pointing by humans) than are chimpanzees.&lt;ref name="Jabr"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/clever-critters-bonobos-that-share-brainy-bugs-and-social-dogs/|publisher=Scientific American|title=Clever critters: Bonobos that share, brainy bugs and social dogs|author=Jabr, F.|date=June 8, 2010|accessdate=April 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, Towner wrote, "the issue may have evolved beyond whether or not there is theory of mind in non-human primates to a more sophisticated appreciation that the concept of mind has many facets and some of these may exist in non-human primates while others may not."&lt;ref name="Towner" /&gt; Horowitz, working with dogs, agreed with this and suggested that her recent results and previous findings called for the introduction of an intermediate stage of ability, a rudimentary theory of mind, to describe animals' performance.&lt;ref name="Horowitz2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Horowitz, A.|year=2011|title=Theory of mind in dogs? Examining method and concept|journal=Learning &amp; Behavior|volume=39|issue=4|pages=314–317|doi=10.3758/s13420-011-0041-7|pmid=21789555|url=http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/spackled/2011readings/Horowitz.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Whiten reviewed the literature and concluded that regarding the question "Are chimpanzees truly mentalists, like we are?", he stated he could not offer an affirmative or negative answer.&lt;ref name="Whiten2013" /&gt;  A similarly equivocal view was stated in 2014 by Brauer, who suggested that many previous experiments on ToM could be explained by the animals possessing other abilities.  They went on further to make reference to several authors who suggest it is pointless to ask a "yes or no" question, rather, it makes more sense to ask which psychological states animals understand and to what extent.&lt;ref name="Brauer" /&gt;  At the same time, it was suggested that a "minimal theory of mind" may be "what enables those with limited cognitive resources or little conceptual sophistication, such as infants, chimpanzees, scrub-jays and human adults under load, to track others' perceptions, knowledge states and beliefs."&lt;ref name="Butterfill"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Butterfill, S.A.  |author2=Apperly, I.A. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2013|title=How to construct a minimal theory of mind|journal=Mind &amp; Language|volume=28|issue=5|pages=606–637|url=http://www.ianapperly.eclipse.co.uk/Butterfill%20Apperly%20Min%20ToM.pdf|doi=10.1111/mila.12036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Cecilia Heyes]], Professor of Psychology at the University of Oxford, wrote about research on ToM, "Since that time [2000], many enthusiasts have become sceptics, empirical methods have become more limited, and it is no longer clear what research on animal mindreading is trying to find" and "However, after some 35 years of research on mindreading in animals, there is still nothing resembling a consensus about whether ''any'' animal can ascribe ''any'' mental state" (Heyes' emphasis).  Heyes further suggested that "In combination with the use of inanimate control stimuli, species that are unlikely to be capable of mindreading, and the 'goggles method' [see below], these approaches could restore both vigour and rigour to research on animal mindreading."&lt;ref name="Heyes2015" /&gt;

==Methods==
Specific categories of behaviour are sometimes used as evidence of animal ToM, including imitation, self-recognition, social relationships, deception, role-taking (empathy), perspective-taking, teaching and co-operation,&lt;ref name="Towner" /&gt; however, this approach has been criticised.&lt;ref name="Heyes1998"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Heyes, C.M.|year=1998|title=Theory of mind in nonhuman primates|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=21|issue=1|pages=101–114|pmid=10097012|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/117063/1/download.14pdf.pdf|doi=10.1017/s0140525x98000703}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some researchers focus on animals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge, i.e. what another being has seen.  Several experimental methods have been developed which are widely used or suggested as appropriate tests for nonhuman animals possessing ToM. Some studies look at communication between individuals of the same species ([[Biological specificity|intraspecific]]) whereas others investigate behaviour between individuals of different species ([[Biological specificity|interspecific]]).

===Knower-Guesser===
The Knower-Guesser method has been used in many studies relating to animal ToM.  Animals are tested in a two-stage procedure. At the beginning of each trial in the first discrimination training stage, an animal is in a room with two humans. One human, designated the "Guesser," leaves the room, and the other, the "Knower," baits one of several containers. The containers are screened so that the animal can see who does the baiting, but not where the food has been placed. After baiting, the Guesser returns to the room, the screen is removed, and each human points directly at a container. The Knower points at the baited container, and the Guesser at one of the other three, chosen at random. The animal is allowed to search one container and to keep the food if it is found.&lt;ref name="Heyes1998" /&gt;

===Competitive feeding paradigm===
The competitive feeding paradigm approach is considered by some as evidence that animals have some understanding of the relationship between "seeing" and "knowing".&lt;ref name="Heyes2015" /&gt;

At the beginning of each trial in the paradigm, a subordinate animal (the individual thought to be doing the mind-reading) and a dominant animal are kept on opposite sides of a test arena which contains two visual barriers. In all trials, a researcher enters the enclosure and places food on the subordinate's side of one of the visual barriers (one baiting event), and in some trials the researcher re-enters the enclosure several seconds later and moves the food to the subordinate's side of the other visual barrier (second baiting event).  The door to the subordinate's cage is open during any baiting by the researcher. The conditions vary according to whether the dominant's door is open or closed during the baiting events, and therefore whether the subordinate individual can see the dominant. After baiting, both of the animals are released into the test arena, with the subordinate being released several seconds before the dominant. If the animals possess ToM, it is expected that subordinates are more likely to gain the food, and more likely to approach the food under several circumstances: (1) When the dominant's door is closed during trials with a single baiting event; (2) when the dominant's door is open during a first baiting event but closed during a second; (3) in single baiting event trials with the dominant's door open, subordinates are more likely to get the food when they compete at the end of the trial with a dominant individual who did not see the baiting.

===Goggles Method===
In one suggested protocol, chimpanzees are given first-hand experience of wearing two mirrored visors. One of the visors is transparent whereas the other is not. The visors themselves are of markedly different colours or shapes. During the subsequent test session, the chimpanzees are given the opportunity to use their species-typical begging behaviour to request food from one of the two humans, one wearing the transparent visor and the other wearing the opaque. If chimpanzees possess ToM, it would be expected they would beg more often from the human wearing the transparent visor.

===False Belief Test===
A method used to test ToM in human children has been adapted for testing non-human animals. The basis of the test is to track the gaze of the animal.  One human hides an object in view of a second human who then leaves the room.  The object is then removed.  The second human returns whereupon they will mistakenly look for the object where they last saw it.  If the animal stares first and longest at the location where the human last saw the object, this suggests they expect him to believe it is still hidden in that place.&lt;ref name="Smith2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Apes understand that some things are all in your head|date=October 16, 2016|accessdate=January 3, 2017|url=https://today.duke.edu/2016/10/falsebeliefs|publisher=DukeToday|author=Smith, R.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In nonhuman primates==

Many ToM studies have used nonhuman primates (NHPs).  One study that examined the understanding of intention in orangutans (''Pongo pygmaeus''), chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'') and children showed that all three species understood the difference between accidental and intentional acts.&lt;ref name="Call"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Call, J.  |author2=Tomasello, M.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1998 | title = Distinguishing intentional from accidental actions in orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and human children (Homo sapiens) | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 112 | issue = 2| pages = 192–206 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.112.2.192 | pmid = 9642787 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chimpanzees===
There is controversy over the interpretation of evidence purporting to show ToM in chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00053-6 |title=Chimpanzee minds: Suspiciously human? |year=2003 |author1=Povinelli, D.J.  |author2=Vonk, J. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=157–160 |pmid=12691763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Field and [[Sue Savage-Rumbaugh]] have no doubt that bonobos have evolved ToM and cite their communications with a captive [[bonobo]] (''Pan paniscus''), [[Kanzi]], as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hamilton, J.|title=A voluble visit with two talking apes|url=https://www.npr.org/2006/07/08/5503685/a-voluble-visit-with-two-talking-apes|accessdate= March 21, 2012|newspaper=NPR|date=July 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, empirical studies show that chimpanzees are unable to follow a human's gaze,&lt;ref name="Call1998"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Call, J.|author2=Hare, B. |author3=Tomasello, M.|year=1998|title=Chimpanzee gaze following in an object choice task|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=1|issue=2|pages=89–99|lastauthoramp=yes|doi=10.1007/s100710050013|pmid=24399273}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are unable to use other human-eye information.&lt;ref name="Povinelli1996"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Povinelli, D.  |author2=Eddy, T. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1996|title=What young chimpanzees know about seeing|journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|volume=61|issue=3|pages=247|pmid=8795292|doi=10.2307/1166159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Povinelli, D.J.|author2= Nelson, K.E. |author3=Boysen, S.T.|year=1990|title=Inferences about guessing and knowing by chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'') | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 104 | issue = 3| pages = 203–210 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.104.3.203 | pmid = 2225758 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to use the "Goggles Method" (see above) on highly human-[[Enculturation|enculturated]] chimpanzees failed to demonstrate they possess ToM.&lt;ref name="Penn2007" /&gt;

In contrast, chimpanzees use the gaze of other chimpanzees to gain information about whether food is accessible.&lt;ref name="Hare2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hare, B.|author2= Call, J.|author3=Agnetta, B. |author4=Tomasello, M.|year=2000|title=Chimpanzees know what conspecifics do and do not see|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=59|issue=4|pages=771–785|pmid=10792932|doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1377|url=https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/sites/evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/files/site-images/Hare%20et%20al_%202000_%20Chimpanzees%20know%20what%20conspecifics%20do%20and%20do%20not%20see.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subordinate chimpanzees are able to use the knowledge state of dominant chimpanzees to determine which container has hidden food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Hare, B.|author2= Call, J.|author3=Tomasello, M.| year = 2001 | title = Do chimpanzees know what conspecifics know and do not know? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 61 | issue = 1| pages = 139–151 | doi = 10.1006/anbe.2000.1518 | pmid=11170704|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If chimpanzees can see two opaque boards on a table and are expecting to find food, they do not choose a board lying flat because if food was under there, it would not be lying flat.  Rather, they choose a slanted board, presumably inferring that food underneath is causing the slant. Chimpanzees appear able to know that other chimpanzees in the same situation make a similar inference. In a foraging game, when their competitor had chosen before them, chimpanzees avoided the slanted board on the assumption that the competitor had already chosen it.&lt;ref name="Schmelz2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Schmelz, M.|author2=Call, J.|author3=Tomasello, M.|title=Chimpanzees know that others make inferences|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA|volume=108|issue=7|pages=3077–3079|year=2011|lastauthoramp=yes|doi=10.1073/pnas.1000469108|pmc=3041140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a similar study, chimps were provided with a preference box with two compartments, one containing a picture of food, the other containing a picture of nothing (the pictures had no causal relation to the contents). In a foraging competition game, chimpanzees avoided the chamber with the picture of food when their competitor had chosen one of the chambers before them.  The authors suggested this was presumably on the assumption that the competitor shared their own preference for it and had already chosen it.&lt;ref name="Schmelz2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Schmelz, M.|author2=Call, J. |author3=Tomasello, M.|title=Chimpanzees predict that a competitor's preference will match their own|journal=Biology Letters|volume=9|issue=1|pages=20120829|year=2013|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2012.0829|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/9/1/20120829|pmid=23193044|lastauthoramp=yes|pmc=3565493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study tested another sensory mode of ToM.  In a food competition, a human sat inside a booth with one piece of food to their left and one to their right.  The food could be withdrawn from the competing chimpanzee's reach when necessary. In the first experiment, the chimpanzee could approach either side of the booth unseen by the human, but then had to reach through either a transparent or opaque tube to get the food. In a second experiment, both were transparent and the human was looking away, but one of the tubes made a loud rattle when it was opened. Chimpanzees reached through the opaque tube in the first experiment and the silent tube in the second.  The chimpanzees successfully concealed their food-stealing from their human competitor in both cases.&lt;ref name="Melis2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Melis, A.P.|author2=Call, J.|author3=Tomasello, M.|year=2006|title=Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) conceal visual and auditory information from others|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=120|issue=2|pages=154–62|pmid=16719594|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/psycho/pdf/Publications_2006_PDF/Chimpanzees_Conceal_Visual_06.pdf|doi= 10.1037/0735-7036.120.2.154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chimpanzees have passed the False Belief Test (see above) involving anticipating the gaze of humans when objects have been removed.&lt;ref name="Krupenye"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Krupenye, C., Kano, F., Hirata, S., Call, J. and Tomasello, M.|year=2016|title=Great apes anticipate that other individuals will act according to false beliefs|journal=Science|volume=354|issue=6308|pages=110–114|doi=10.1126/science.aaf8110|pmid=27846501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other primates===
[[File:Rhesus Macaque (Macaca mulatta) in Kinnarsani WS, AP W IMG 5792.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rhesus macaques selectively steal grapes from humans who are incapable of seeing the grape compared to humans who can see the grape.]]
In one approach testing monkeys, [[rhesus macaque]]s (''Macaca mulatta'') are able to "steal" a contested [[grape]] from one of two human competitors. In six experiments, the macaques selectively stole the grape from a human who was incapable of seeing the grape, rather than from the human who was visually aware. The authors suggest that rhesus macaques possess an essential component of ToM: the ability to deduce what others perceive on the basis of where they are looking.&lt;ref name="Flombaum"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Flombaum, J.I.  |author2=Santos, L.R. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005|title=Rhesus monkeys attribute perceptions to others|journal=Current Biology|volume=15|issue=5 |pages=447–452|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.076}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, free ranging rhesus macaques preferentially choose to steal food items from locations where they can be less easily observed by humans, or where they will make less noise.&lt;ref name="Whiten2013" /&gt;

A [[comparative psychology]] approach tested six species of captive NHPs (three species of great apes: orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and three species of old-world monkeys: [[lion-tailed macaque]]s (''Macaca silenus''), rhesus macaques and [[collared mangabey]]s (''Cercocebus torquatus'')) in a "hide and seek" game in which the NHPs played against a human opponent. In each trial, the NHP has to infer where food has been hidden (either in their right or left hand) by the human opponent. In general, the NHPs failed the test (whereas humans did not), but surprisingly, performances between the NHP species did not reveal any inter-species differences.  The authors also reported that at least one individual of each of the species showed (weak) evidence of ToM.&lt;ref name="San‑Galli"&gt;{{cite journal|author=San‑Galli, A.|author2=Devaine, M.|author3=Trapanese, C.|author4=Masi, S.|author5=Bouret, S. |author6= Daunizeau, J.|year=2015|title=Playing hide and seek with primates: A comparative study of Theory of Mind|journal=Revue de Primatologie|volume=6|issue=6|pages=4–7|lastauthoramp=yes|doi= 10.4000/primatologie.2182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a multi-species study, it was shown that chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans passed the False Belief Test (see above).&lt;ref name="Krupenye" /&gt;

In 2009, a summary of the ToM research, particularly emphasising an extensive comparison of humans, chimpanzees and orang-utans,&lt;ref name="Herrmann2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Herrmann, E.|author2=Call, J.|author3=Hernández-Lloreda, M.V.|author4=Hare, B.|author5=Tomasello, M.|year=2007|title=Humans have evolved specialized skills of social cognition: The cultural intelligence hypothesis|journal=Science|volume=317|issue=5843|pages=1360–1366|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/317/5843/1360|lastauthoramp=yes|doi=10.1126/science.1146282|pmid=17823346}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that [[great ape]]s do not exhibit understanding of human referential intentions expressed in communicative gestures, such as pointing.&lt;ref name="Topal" /&gt;

==In birds==

===Parrots===
[[Grey parrot]]s (''Psittacus erithacus'') have demonstrated high levels of intelligence.  [[Irene Pepperberg]] did experiments with these and her most accomplished parrot, [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]], demonstrated behaviour which seemed to manipulate the trainer, possibly indicating theory of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=114 |chapter=Theory of Mind |title=The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution |author=Irene Pepperberg |editor1=Maggie Tallerman |editor2=Kathleen R.

===Ravens===
[[File:Corvus corax along road detail.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Ravens adjust their caching behaviour according to whether they have been watched and who was watching them.]]
[[Raven]]s are members of the [[corvidae]] family and are widely regarded as having complex cognitive abilities.&lt;ref name="Emery2004"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Emery, N.J.  |author2=Clayton, N.S. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2004|title=The mentality of crows: convergent evolution of intelligence in corvids and apes|journal=Science|volume=306|issue=5703|pages=1903–1907|doi=10.1126/science.1098410|pmid=15591194|url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/biology/jbasil/documents/CrowApeCognition.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food-storing ravens [[Hoarding (animal behavior)|cache]] (hoard) their food and pilfer (steal) from other ravens' caches.  They protect their caches from being pilfered by conspecifics using aggression, dominance and re-caching.  Potential pilferers rarely approach caches until the storing birds have left the cache vicinity.  When storers are experimentally prevented from leaving the vicinity of the cache, pilferers first search at places other than the cache sites. When ravens (''Corvus corax'') witness a conspecific making caches, to pilfer those caches they (1) delay approaching the cache only when in the presence of the storer, and (2) quickly engage in searching away from the caches when together with dominant storers.  These behaviours raise the possibility that ravens are capable of withholding their intentions, and also providing false information to avoid provoking the storer's aggression to protect its cache.  Ravens adjust their pilfering behaviour according to when the storers are likely to defend the caches.  This supports the suggestion that they are deceptively manipulating the other's behaviour.&lt;ref name="Bugnyar2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bugnyar, T.  |author2=Heinrich, B. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2006|title=Pilfering ravens, Corvus corax, adjust their behaviour to social context and identity of competitors|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=9|issue=4|pages=369–376|doi=10.1007/s10071-006-0035-6|pmid=16909235}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other studies indicate that ravens recall whom was watching them during caching, but also know the effects of visual barriers on what competitors can and can not see, and how this affects their pilfering.&lt;ref name="Bugnyar2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bugnyar, T.  |author2=Heinrich, B. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005|title=Ravens, Corvus corax, differentiate between knowledgeable and ignorant competitors|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|volume=272|issue=1573|pages=1641–1646|pmc=1559847|pmid=16087417|doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ravens have been tested for their understanding of "seeing" as a mental state in other ravens.  It appears they take into account the visual access of other ravens, even when they cannot see the other raven.&lt;ref name="MacDonald"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hngn.com/articles/175896/20160203/theory-mind-ravens-understand-others-minds-study.htm|title=Theory of mind: Ravens understand that others have minds, study says|author=MacDonald, T.|date=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, ravens were tested in two rooms separated by a wooden wall. The wall had two functional windows that could be closed with covers; each cover had a peephole drilled into it.  In the next familiarization step, the ravens are trained to use a peephole to observe and pilfer human-made caches in the adjacent room. Under test conditions, there was no other raven present in the adjacent room, however, a hidden loudspeaker played a series of sounds recorded from a competitor raven.  The storing raven generalized from their own experience when using the peephole to pilfer the human-made caches and predicted that the audible (raven) competitors could potentially see their caches through the peep-hole and took appropriate action, i.e. the storing ravens finished their caches more quickly and they returned to improve their caches less often.  The researchers pointed out that this represented "seeing" in a way that cannot be reduced to the tracking of gaze cues – a criticism leveled at many other studies of ToM.&lt;ref name="Bugnyar2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bugnyar, T.|author2=Reber, S.A.|author3=Buckner, C.|year=2016|title=Ravens attribute visual access to unseen competitors|journal=Nature Communications|volume=7|doi=10.1038/ncomms10506|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160202/ncomms10506/full/ncomms10506.html|lastauthoramp=yes|pages=10506|pmid=26835849|pmc=4740864}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The researchers further suggested that their findings could be considered in terms of the "minimal" (as opposed to "full-blown") ToM recently suggested.&lt;ref name="Butterfill" /&gt;

Using the Knower-Guesser approach, ravens observing a human hiding food are capable of predicting the behaviour of bystander ravens that had been visible at both, none or just one of two baiting events.  The visual field of the competitors was manipulated independently of the view of the test-raven.  The findings indicate that ravens not only remember whom they have seen at caching but they also take into account that the other raven's view was blocked.&lt;ref name="Bugnyar2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bugnyar, T.|year=2010|title=Knower–guesser differentiation in ravens: others' viewpoints matter|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|pages=rspb20101514|doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.1514|volume=278|issue=1705|pmc=3025684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scrub jays===
[[File:Aphelocoma californica in Seattle cropped.jpg|thumb|250px|Western scrub jays may show evidence of possessing theory of mind]]
[[Scrub jay]]s are also corvids.  [[Western scrub jay]]s (''Aphelocoma californica'') both cache food and pilfer other scrub jays' caches.  They use a range of tactics to minimise the possibility that their own caches will be pilfered. One of these tactics is to remember which individual scrub jay watched them during particular caching events and adjust their re-caching behaviour accordingly.&lt;ref name="Dally"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dally, J.M.|author2=Emery, N.J. |author3=Clayton, N.S.|year=2006|title=Food-caching western scrub-jays keep track of who was watching when|journal=Science|volume=312|issue=5780|pages=1662–1665|pmid=16709747|doi=10.1126/science.1126539|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/312/5780/1662}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study with particularly interesting results found that only scrub jays which had themselves pilfered would re-cache when they had been observed making the initial cache.&lt;ref name="Emery2001"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Emery, N.

In a computer modeling study using "virtual birds", it was suggested that re-caching is not motivated by a deliberate effort to protect specific caches from pilfering, but by a general motivation to simply cache more. This motivation is brought on by stress, which is affected by the presence and dominance of onlookers, and by unsuccessful recovery attempts.&lt;ref name="Vaart"&gt;{{cite journal|author=van der Vaart E.|author2=Verbrugge R. |author3=Hemelrijk, C.K.|year=2012|title=Corvid re-caching without 'Theory of Mind': A model|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|issue=3|pages=e32904|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032904|lastauthoramp=yes|pmid=22396799|pmc=3291480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In dogs==
[[File:Duitse staande korthaar 10-10-2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dogs can use the pointing behaviour of humans to determine the location of food.]]
Domestic [[dog]]s (''Canis familiaris'') show an impressive ability to use the behaviour of humans to find food and toys using behaviours such as pointing and gazing.  The performance of dogs in these studies is superior to that of NHPs,&lt;ref name="Maginnity"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Maginnity, M.E.  |author2=Grace, R.C. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2014|title=Visual perspective taking by dogs (Canis familiaris) in a Guesser–Knower task: evidence for a canine theory of mind?|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=17|issue=6|pages=1375–1392 |doi=10.1007/s10071-014-0773-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, some have stated categorically that dogs do not possess a human-like ToM.&lt;ref name="Brauer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bräuer, J.|year=2014|chapter=Chapter 10 – What dogs understand about humans|title=The Social Dog: Behaviour and Cognition|editor=Kaminski, J. |editor2=Marshall-Pescini, S.|pages=295–317|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guesser-Knower approach has been used with ToM studies in dogs.  In one study, each of two toys was placed on the dog's side of two barriers, one opaque and one transparent. In experimental conditions, a human sat on the opposite side of the barriers, such that they could see only the toy behind the transparent barrier. The human then told the dog to 'Fetch' without indicating either toy in any way. In a control, the human sat on the opposite side but with their back turned so that they could see neither toy.  In a second control, the human sat on the same side as the dog such that they could see both toys. When the toys were differentiable, dogs approached the toy behind the transparent barrier in experimental as compared to "back-turned" and "same-side" condition. Dogs did not differentiate between the two control conditions. The authors suggested that, even in the absence of overt behavioural cues, dogs are sensitive to others' visual access, even if that differs from their own.&lt;ref name="Kaminski2009"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kaminski, J.|author2=Bräuer, J.|author3=Call, J.|author4=Tomasello, M.|year=2009|title=Domestic dogs are sensitive to a human's perspective|journal=Behaviour|volume=146|issue=7|pages=979–998|lastauthoramp=yes|doi=10.1163/156853908X395530|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/psycho/pdf/dog_cognition/Kaminski_et_al_2009a_dogs_sensitive_humans_perspective.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, dogs preferentially use the behaviour of the human Knower to indicate the location of food.  This is unrelated to the sex or age of the dog.  In another study, 14 of 15 dogs preferred the location indicated by the Knower on the first trial, whereas chimpanzees require approximately 100 trials to reliably exhibit the preference.&lt;ref name="Maginnity" /&gt;

Human infants (10 months old) continue to search for hidden objects at their initial hiding place, even after observing them being hidden at another location.  This perseverance of searching errors is at least partly contributed to by behavioural cues from the experimenter. Domestic dogs also commit more search errors in communicative trials than in non-communicative or non-social hiding trials. However, human-encultured [[Wolf|wolves]] (''Canis lupus'') do not show this context-dependent perseverance in searching. This common sensitivity to human communication behaviour may arise from [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref name="Topal"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Topál, J.|author2=Gergely, G.|author3=Erdőhegyi, A.|author4=Csibra, G.|author5=Miklósi, A.|title=Differential sensitivity to human communication in dogs, wolves, and human infants|journal=Science|volume=325|issue=5945|year=2009|pages=1269–1272|lastauthoramp=yes|doi=10.1126/science.1176960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogs which have been forbidden to take food are more likely to steal the food if a human observer has their back turned or eyes closed than when the human is looking at them. Dogs are also more likely to beg for food from an observer whose eyes are visible compared to an observer whose eyes are covered by a blindfold.&lt;ref name="Maginnity" /&gt;

In a study of the way that dogs interact, play signals were sent almost exclusively to forward-facing partners.  In contrast, attention-getting behaviors were used most often when the other dog was facing away, and before signaling an interest to play. Furthermore, the type of attention-getting behaviour matched the inattentiveness of the playmate.  Stronger attention-getting behaviours were used when a playmate was looking away or distracted, less forceful ones when the partner was facing forward or laterally,&lt;ref name="Horowitz"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10071-008-0175-y |title=Attention to attention in domestic dog (Canis familiaris) dyadic play |year=2008 |author=Horowitz, A.|journal=Animal Cognition |volume=12 |pages=107–18 |pmid=18679727 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In pigs==
An experiment at the [[University of Bristol]] found that one out of ten pigs was possibly able to understand what other pigs can see. That pig observed another pig which had view of a maze in which food was being hidden, and trailed that pig through the maze to the food. The other pigs involved in the experiment did not.&lt;ref name="Mosaic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mosaicscience.com/extra/smartest-animal-youve-never-heard|title=The smartest animal you've never heard of|date=February 10, 2015|accessdate=April 18, 2016|author=Aldhous, P.|publisher=Wellcome Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Held"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Held, S.|author2=Mendl, M.|author3=Devereux, C.|author4=Byrne, R.W.|title=Behaviour of domestic pigs in a visual perspective taking task|journal=Behaviour|volume=138|issue=11|year=2001|pages=1337–1354|doi=10.1163/156853901317367627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In goats==
A 2006 study found that goats exhibited intricate social behaviours indicative of high-level cognitive processes, particularly in competitive situations. The study included an experiment in which a subordinate animal was allowed to choose between food that a dominant animal could also see and food that it could not; those who were subject to aggressive behaviour selected the food that the dominant animal could not see, suggesting that they are able to perceive a threat based on being within the dominant animal's view &amp;ndash; in other words, visual perspective taking.&lt;ref name="Kaminski2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kaminski, J.|author2=Call, J.|author3=Tomasello, M.|year=2006|title=Goats' behaviour in a competitive food paradigm: Evidence for perspective taking?|journal=Behaviour|volume=143|issue=11|pages=1341–1356|doi=10.1163/156853906778987542|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/documents/Brill/Kaminski_Goats_Behaviour_2006_1555089.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5995">'''Thomas Henry Croxall''' was an [[English people|English]] minister in [[Copenhagen]], instrumental in translating the work of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and introducing him to an English audience.

Croxall is notable because he was interested in the writings of Søren Kierkegaard for their Christian content. He wrote after David F. Swenson and Walter Lowrie had begun translating some of Kierkegaard's works into English, both also hoping to attract Christian readers. Croxall translated ''Søren Kierkegaard'', by Johannes Edouard Hohlenberg, 1954. He studied Søren Kierkegaard's writings for over twenty years and translated ''Johannes Climacus'' written in 1843-1844 by Kierkegaard but never published and provided his own assessment. He related Kierkegaard's works to the scriptures in his books ''Meditations'' and ''Kierkegaard Studies'', where he wrote: “Kierkegaard is in the air these days. He has not yet, so far as I know, become on the air, but that doubtless will come, for he is constantly quoted and discussed (discussed, I fear, more than read). What then is all the fuss about, and what is his distinctive teaching? Now, any lover of Kierkegaard (and such I most certainly am) longs to answer such a question. He has found in Kierkegaard’s teaching a new and stimulating body of thought, which to him is like a pearl of great price, worth anything to possess. But since the pearl is spiritual treasure, not material, that treasure must be shared if its value is not to diminish. Hence I desire to share the treasure.” ''Studies'' 1948 p.&amp;nbsp;11.

Croxall provides the reader with a “wealth of beauty, fragrance, and sustenance” in his ''Meditations''. Most of the meditations came from the Journals and Papers of Søren Kierkegaard from Croxall’s own translations. He recognized, in 1944, the need for better translations of Kierkegaard’s works. His translation, he said, “is “new”; I mean in its form and presentation. Søren Kierkegaard is a deep philosopher, but he is first and foremost a Christian; a penetrating student and exponent of the Scriptures; and above all, a man of prayer and meditation, who, as he himself confesses, spent every day in the quiet of his chamber with God.” ''Meditations'' 1955 p. 1.

==Interpretation==
Croxall is one of a number of Christian authors who argued that Kierkegaard's work is Christian to the core, that "his interest is religious or exclusively Christian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagi|first=Abraham|title=Kierkegaard, religion, and existence: the voyage of the self|year=2000|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-1412-1|pages=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_1KqB79Y3l8C&amp;pg=PA184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Kierkegaard is Christian. Some 'existentialists' – Berdyaev, Dostoevsky, Unamuno, "Maritain, Chestov, Marcel – concur in being, in varying degrees, Christian too. Many, however-Bataille, Sartre, Camus, Jaspers, Heidegger are atheistic, so that atheism and existentialism are sometimes thought synonymous. These writers 'extract from religion its most useful attributes and re-secularize them, making a ‘corner’ in thought.'" Studies 1948 p. 60.

Croxall translated Kierkegaard’s works in the aftermath of World War II. He says, again from ''Kierkegaard Studies'', “Need I say that our age, with its industrial “massification”, its twin tyrannies of newspaper and ballot-box (present to-day just as they were in Kierkegaard’s time: unknown to Kierkegaard, those of the radio and the cinema), its trade unions, federations, combines; its feverish enslavement to fashion; its indecision and bewilderment about the meaning and purpose of life; its pursuit of pleasure and of the false gods of aestheticism, superstition, and selfishness, its belief that it has “gone farther” than Christianity, when really it has scarcely even approached Christianity (Heaven turn us from continuing along the path which has disastrously taken us “farther”!)-all this and much more shows that we are in as dire need as were his contemporaries, of Kierkegaard’s great doctrine of the Individual.” ''Studies'' 1948 p.&amp;nbsp;15.

[[File:Théodicée title page.jpeg|thumb|''Théodicée'' title page from a 1734 version]]
'''''Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu, la liberté de l'homme et l'origine du mal''''' ("Essays of Theodicy on the Goodness of God, the Freedom of Man and the Origin of Evil"), more simply known as '''''Théodicée''''', is a book of philosophy by the German polymath [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. The book, published in 1710, introduced the term ''[[theodicy]]'', and its optimistic approach to the [[problem of evil]] is thought to have inspired Voltaire's ''[[Candide]]'' (albeit satirically).  Much of the work consists of a response to the ideas of the French philosopher [[Pierre Bayle]], with whom Leibniz carried on a debate for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''Introduction to'' Theodicy|author=Austin Farrer|authorlink=Austin Farrer|publisher=Open Court|year=1985|isbn=0-87548-437-9|location=La Salle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Théodicée'' was the only book Leibniz published during his lifetime;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz-evil/|title=Leibniz on the Problem of Evil|date=16 March 2005|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=Michael Murray|accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; his other book, ''[[New Essays on Human Understanding]]'', was published only after his death, in 1765.

==Central claims==

In various works, including his famous ''Historical and Critical Dictionary'' (1697), Pierre Bayle had argued that there is no defensible rational solution to the problem of why God permits evil. More specifically, Bayle had argued that powerful philosophical arguments can be given against a number of orthodox Christian teachings, including the goodness, justice, and freedom of God. Leibniz responds to Bayle's arguments in detail, arguing that it can be proved that God is an infinitely perfect being, and that such a being must have created a world that has the greatest possible balance of good over evil ("the [[best of all possible worlds]]").&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Leibniz, ''Theodicy: Essays on the Goodness of God, the'' ''Freedom of Man, and the Origin of Evil''. Translated by E. M. Huggard. Lasalle, IL: Open Court, 1985, pp. 127-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz distinguishes three forms of evil: moral, physical, and metaphysical. Moral evil is sin, physical evil is pain, and metaphysical evil is limitation.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, ''Theodicy'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; God permits moral and physical evil for the sake of greater goods, and metaphysical evil (i.e., limitation) is unavoidable since any created universe must necessarily fall short of God's absolute perfection. Human free will is consistent with God's foreknowledge, because even though all events in the universe are foreseen and pre-determined, they are not necessitated (i. e., logically necessary), and only if human choices were necessitated would free will be an illusion.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, ''Theodicy'', p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; Against Bayle's claims (derived from [[Augustine]]) that it is unjust for God to damn unbaptized infants or adult non-Christians who had lived as well as they could, Leibniz denies that Christian teaching supports such claims.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, ''Theodicy'', p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Against Bayle's claim that God cannot be free since he cannot fail to choose the best, Leibniz argues that such "moral necessity" is consistent with divine freedom. God would lack freedom only if there are no possible worlds in which less than maximal goodness exists, which is not the case, Leibniz argues.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, ''Theodicy'', p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism}}

'''Zen''' ({{lang-zh|t=禪|p=Chán}}; {{lang-ko|text=선|translit=Seon}}) is a [[schools of Buddhism|school of Mahayana Buddhism]] that originated in [[China]] during the [[Tang dynasty]] as [[Chan Buddhism]]. It was strongly influenced by [[Taoism]] and developed as a distinct school of [[Chinese Buddhism]]. From China, Chan Buddhism spread south to [[Vietnam]] which became [[Vietnamese Thiền]], northeast to [[Korea]] and east to [[Japan]], where it became known as [[Korean Seon|Seon Buddhism]] and [[Japanese Zen]], respectively.{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=159–169}}

The term Zen is derived from the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] pronunciation of the [[Middle Chinese]] word 禪 (Chan) which traces its roots to the [[India]]n practice of [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|Dhyāna]] ("meditation").{{refn|group=note|Dumoulin writes in his preface to ''Zen. A History. Part One: India and China'': "Zen (Chin. Ch'an, an abbreviation of ''ch'an-na'', which transliterates the Sanskrit ''Dhyāna'' (Devanagari: ध्यान) or its Pali cognate ''Jhāna'' (Sanskrit; Pāli झान) , terms meaning "meditation") is the name of a Mahayana Buddhist school of meditation originating in China. It is characterized by the practice of meditation in the lotus position (Jpn., ''zazen''; Chin., ''tso-ch'an'' and the use of the koan (Chin., ''kung-an'') as well as by the enlightenment experience of ''satori''{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=xvii}}}} Zen emphasizes rigorous [[self-control]], meditation-practice, [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|insight]] into [[Buddha-nature]], and the personal expression of this insight in daily life, especially for [[Bodhisattva|the benefit of others]].{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2010|p=41}}{{sfn|Sekida|1989}} As such, it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of [[sutra]]s and doctrine{{sfn|Poceski|Year unknown}}{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=8}} and favors direct understanding through [[zazen]] and interaction with an accomplished teacher.{{sfn|Yampolski|2003a|p=3}}

The teachings of Zen include various sources of Mahayana thought, especially [[Yogachara]], the [[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras]] and the [[Huayan school]], with their emphasis on Buddha-nature, [[Two truths doctrine|totality]], and the Bodhisattva-ideal.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=48}}{{sfn|Lievens|1981|p=52–53}} The [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]] literature{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=41–45}} and, to a lesser extent, [[Madhyamaka]] have also been influential in the shaping of the "paradoxical language" of the Zen-tradition.

==Etymology==
The word ''Zen'' is derived from the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] pronunciation of the [[Middle Chinese]] word 禪 ({{IPA|dʑjen}}) ([[pinyin]]: ''Chán''), which in turn is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]'' (ध्यान ),{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=xvii}} which can be approximately translated as "absorption" or "[[Buddhist meditation|meditative state]]".{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=24}}

==Zen practice==
{{See also|Dhyāna in Buddhism}}

Central to Zen is the practice of [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]] or [[buddhist meditation|meditation]].

===Origins===
The practice of meditation entered into Chinese through the translations of [[An Shigao]] (fl. c. 148–180 CE), and [[Kumārajīva]] (334–413 CE), who both translated [[Dhyāna sutras]], which were influential early meditation texts mostly based on the Yogacara meditation teachings of the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] school of [[Kashmir]] circa 1st-4th centuries CE.&lt;ref name=Deleanu&gt;Deleanu, Florin (1992); [https://ahandfulofleaves.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mindfulness-of-breathing-in-the-dhayana-sutra_florin-deleanu_1992.pdf Mindfulness of Breathing in the Dhyāna Sūtras].

While ''dhyana'' in a strict sense refers to the four ''dhyanas'', in Chinese Buddhism ''dhyāna'' may refer to [[Kammaṭṭhāna|various kinds of meditation techniques]] and their preparatory practices, which are necessary to practice ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=103}} The five main types of meditation in the ''Dhyana sutras'' are [[anapanasati]] (mindfulness of breathing); [[patikulamanasikara|paṭikūlamanasikāra]] meditation, mindfulness of the impurities of the body; loving-kindness [[mettā|maitrī]] meditation; the contemplation on the twelve links of [[pratītyasamutpāda]]; and the contemplation on the [[Physical characteristics of the Buddha#The 32 Signs of a Great Man|Buddha’s thirty-two Characteristics]].&lt;ref name=Yuanci&gt;Ven.

===Mindfulness===

====Observing the breath====
[[File:Hsuan Hua Hong Kong 1.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Venerable [[Hsuan Hua]] meditating in the Lotus Position. [[Hong Kong]], 1953.]]

During sitting meditation, practitioners usually assume a position such as the [[lotus position]], half-lotus, Burmese, or [[yoga]] postures, using the [[Mudra#Dhy.C4.81na Mudr.C4.81|dhyāna]] [[mudra|mudrā]]. To regulate the mind, awareness is directed towards counting or watching the breath or by bringing that awareness to the energy center below the navel (see also [[ānāpānasati]]).&lt;ref group =web name="shengyen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundamentals of Meditation|last=Sheng|first=Yen|url=http://www.chancenter.org/chanctr/ddp/talks/zuochan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, a square or round cushion placed on a padded mat is used to sit on; in some other cases, a chair may be used. This practice may simply be called [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|sitting dhyāna]], which is ''zuòchán'' (坐禅) in Chinese, and ''[[zazen]]'' (坐禅) in Japanese, ''jwaseon'' (坐禅) in Korean.

====Observing the mind====
In the Sōtō school of Zen, meditation with no objects, anchors, or content, is the primary form of practice. The meditator strives to be aware of the stream of thoughts, allowing them to arise and pass away without interference. Considerable textual, philosophical, and phenomenological justification of this practice can be found throughout [[Dōgen]]'s ''Shōbōgenzō'', as for example in the "Principles of Zazen"&lt;ref group=web name="zazengi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zazengi translation|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/translations/zazengi/zazengi.html|author=Sōtō Zen Text Project|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|accessdate=15 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117022108/http://web.stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/translations/zazengi/zazengi.html|archive-date=17 November 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen".&lt;ref group=web name="fukanzazengi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/gongyo_seiten/translations/part_3/fukan_zazengi.html|title=Fukan Zazengi|author=Sōtō Zen Text Project|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=2008-03-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429201213/http://www.stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/gongyo_seiten/translations/part_3/fukan_zazengi.html|archivedate=2008-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Japanese language, this practice is called ''[[Shikantaza]]''.

===Insight===

====Pointing to the nature of the mind====
According to Charles Luk, in the earliest traditions of Chán, there was no fixed method or formula for teaching meditation, and all instructions were simply heuristic methods, to point to the true nature of the mind, also known as ''[[Buddha-nature]]''.&lt;ref name="Luk"/&gt; According to Luk, this method is referred to as the "Mind Dharma", and exemplified in the story of Śākyamuni Buddha holding up a flower silently, and [[Mahākāśyapa]] smiling as he understood.&lt;ref name="Luk"&gt;Luk, Charles. ''The Secrets of Chinese Meditation.'' 1964. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; A traditional formula of this is, "Chán points directly to the human mind, to enable people to see their true nature and become buddhas."&lt;ref&gt;Nan, Huai-Chin. ''Basic Buddhism: Exploring Buddhism and Zen.'' 1997. p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kōan practice====
{{Main article|Kōan}}
[[File:Wu (negative).svg|thumb|right|upright|[[Chinese characters|Chinese character]] for "[[Mu (negative)|nothing]]" ({{CJKV|p=wú|r=mu|rr=mu}}). It figures in the famous ''Zhaozhou's dog'' [[kōan]]]]

At the beginning of the [[Sòng dynasty]], practice with the kōan method became popular, whereas others practiced "silent illumination."{{sfn|Blyth|1966}} This became the source of some differences in practice between the [[Linji school|Línjì]] and [[Cáodòng school]]s.

A kōan, literally "public case", is a story or dialogue, describing an interaction between a Zen master and a student. These anecdotes give a demonstration of the master's insight. Koans emphasize the non-conceptional insight that the Buddhist teachings are pointing to. Koans can be used to provoke the "great doubt" and test a student's progress in Zen practice.

Kōan-inquiry may be practiced during zazen (sitting meditation), [[kinhin]] (walking meditation), and throughout all the activities of daily life. Kōan practice is particularly emphasized by the Japanese [[Rinzai school]], but it also occurs in other schools or branches of Zen depending on the teaching line.{{sfn|Loori|2006}}

The Zen student's mastery of a given kōan is presented to the teacher in a private interview (referred to in Japanese as ''dokusan'' (独参), ''daisan'' (代参), or ''sanzen'' (参禅)). While there is no unique answer to a kōan, practitioners are expected to demonstrate their understanding of the kōan and of Zen through their responses. The teacher may approve or disapprove of the answer and guide the student in the right direction. The interaction with a Zen teacher is central in Zen, but makes Zen practice also vulnerable to misunderstanding and exploitation.{{sfn|Lachs|2006}}

===Intensive group meditation===
Intensive group meditation may be practiced occasionally in some temples.  In the Japanese language, this practice is called ''[[Sesshin]]''. While the daily routine may require monks to meditate for several hours each day, during the intensive period they devote themselves almost exclusively to the practice of sitting meditation. The numerous 30–50 minute long meditation periods are interwoven with rest breaks, meals, and short periods of work that are performed with the same [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]]; nightly sleep is kept to seven hours or less. In modern Buddhist practice in Japan, [[Taiwan]], and the West, lay students often attend these intensive practice sessions, which are typically 1, 3, 5, or 7 days in length. These are held at many Zen centers, especially in commemoration of the Buddha's attainment of ''[[Anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi|Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi]]''. One distinctive aspect of Zen meditation in groups is the use of a [[keisaku|kyosaku]], a flat, wooden slat used to strike meditators with the intention of keeping them focused and awake.

===Zen chanting and liturgy===
{{See also|Buddhist chant}}
A practice in many Zen monasteries and centers is a daily liturgy service. Practitioners chant major sutras such as the ''[[Heart Sutra]]'', chapter 25 of the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' (often called the "[[Avalokiteśvara]] Sutra"), ''[[Song of the Precious Mirror Samadhi]]'', the [[Nīlakaṇṭha Dhāraṇī]], and other minor mantras.

The [[butsudan]] is the altar in a monastery where offerings are made to the images of the Buddha or [[bodhisattva]]s. The same term is also used in Japanese homes for the altar where one prays to and communicates with deceased family members. As such, reciting liturgy in Zen can be seen as a means to connect with the Bodhisattvas of the past. Liturgy is often used during funerals, memorials, and other special events as means to invoke the aid of supernatural powers.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Chanting usually centers on major bodhisattvas like [[Avalokiteśvara]] (see [[Guanyin]]) and [[Manjushri]]. According to [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, bodhisattvas are beings who have taken vows to remain in [[saṃsāra]] to help all beings achieve liberation from it. Since the Zen practitioner's aim is to walk the bodhisattva path, chanting can be used as a means to connect with these beings and realize this ideal within oneself.

===Lay services===
Though in western Zen the emphasis is on zen-meditation, and the application of Zen-teachings in daily life, Japanese Zen also serves a function in public religion. [[Japanese funeral|Funerals]] play an important role as a point of contact between the monks and the laity. Statistics published by the Sōtō school state that 80 percent of Sōtō laymen visit their temple only for reasons having to do with funerals and death. Seventeen percent visit for spiritual reasons and 3 percent visit a Zen priest at a time of personal trouble or crisis.{{sfn|Bodiford|1992}}

==Zen teachings==
{{Main article|Doctrinal background of Zen}}

Though Zen-narrative states that it is a "special transmission outside scriptures" which "did not stand upon words",{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=85-94}} Zen does have a rich doctrinal background, which is firmly grounded in the Buddhist tradition.{{sfn|Lai|1985|p=17-18}} It was thoroughly influenced by the Chinese understanding of Yogacara and the Buddha-nature doctrine,{{sfn|Cheng|1981}}{{sfn|Lai|1985}} Zen integrates both Yogacara and Madhyamaka{{sfn|Newland|2001|p=137}} and the influence of Madhyamaka can be discerned in the stress on non-conceptual insight and the paradoxical language of the koans.{{sfn|Cheng|1981}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/b-madhya/ Dan Arnold, ''Madhyamaka Buddhist Philosophy'', Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=228-236}}{{refn|group=note|According to Kalupahana, the influence of Yofacara is stronger in the ts'ao-tung school and the tradition of silent meditation, while the influence of Madhyamaka is clear in the koan-tradition and its stress on insight and the use of paradoxical language.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=228-236}}}} Most essential are "the most fundamental teaching that we are already [[Hongaku|originally enlightened]]",{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=3}} and the Bodhisattva ideal, which supplements [[Wisdom in Buddhism|insight]] with [[Karuṇā]], compassion with all sentient beings.{{sfn|Low|2006}}

To point out 'essential Zen-teachings' is almost impossible, given the variety of schools, the extended history of 1500 years, and the emphasis on [[Tathatā/Dharmatā|suchness]], reality just-as-it-is, which has to be expressed in daily life, not in words.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} But common to most schools and teachings is this emphasis on suchness and Buddha-nature, the Bodhisattva-ideal, and the priority of zazen.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Zen teachings can be likened to "the finger pointing at the moon".{{sfn|Suzuki|1997|p=154}} Zen teachings point to the moon, [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]], "a realization of the unimpeded interpenetration of the [[dharmadhatu]]".{{sfn|Buswell|1993|p=245}} But the Zen-tradition also warns against taking its teachings, the pointing finger, to be this insight itself.{{sfn|Abe|1996|p=19}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khandro.net/Bud_paths_Zen_2.htm |title=Pointing at the moon |publisher=Khandro.net |accessdate=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name=Lanka&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lirs.ru/do/lanka_eng/lanka-nondiacritical.htm |title=Lankavatara Sutra, chapter LXXXII, p.192 Suzuki-translation, p.223/224 in brackets |publisher=Lirs.ru |date=2008-06-16 |accessdate=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Luk|Year unknown|p=59-60}}

The various traditions lay various emphases in their teachings and practices:
{{quote|There are two different ways of understanding and actually practicing Zen. These two different ways are termed in Chinese pen chueh and shih-chueh respectively. The term pen chueh refers to the belief that one’s mind is from the beginning of time fully enlightened, while shih-chueh refers to the belief that at some point in time we pass from imprisonment in ignorance and delusion to a true vision of Zen realization: “Our enlightenment is timeless, yet our realization of it occurs in time.” According to this belief experiencing a moment of awakening in this life is of central importance.{{sfn|Lachs|2012|p=4}}}}

===Rinzai===
{{main article|Rinzai school}}
The Rinzai school is the Japanese lineage of the Chinese Linji school, which was founded during the [[Tang dynasty]] by [[Linji Yixuan]].The Rinzai school emphasizes [[kensho]], insight into one's true nature.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=380}} This is followed by so-called [[Kenshō#Training after kenshō|post-satori practice]], further practice to attain Buddhahood.{{sfn|Sekida (translator)|1996}}{{sfn|Cleary|2010|p=xii–xiii, quoting Hakuin}}{{sfn|Yen|1996|p=54)}}

Other Zen-teachers have also expressed sudden insight followed by gradual cultivation. [[Jinul]], a 12th-century [[Korean Seon]] master, followed Zongmi, and also emphasized that insight into our true nature is sudden, but is to be followed by practice to ripen the insight and attain full buddhahood. This is also the standpoint of the contemporary [[Sanbo Kyodan]], according to whom kenshō is at the start of the path to full enlightenment.{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}

To attain this primary insight and to deepen it, zazen and kōan-study is deemed essential. This trajectory of initial insight followed by a gradual deepening and ripening is expressed by Linji in his [[Linji Yixuan#Expressing the inexpressible|Three Mysterious Gates]] and [[Hakuin Ekaku#Four ways of knowing|Hakuin Ekaku's ''Four Ways of Knowing'']].{{sfn|Low|2006}}  Another example of depiction of stages on the path are the [[Ten Bulls]], which detail the steps on the path.

===Soto===
{{main article|Sōtō}}
Sōtō is the Japanese line of the Chinese [[Caodong school]], which was founded during the Tang Dynasty by [[Dongshan Liangjie]].&lt;!---Unsourced, but correct.---&gt; The Sōtō-school has de-emphasized kōans since [[Gentō Sokuchū]] (circa 1800), and instead emphasized on [[shikantaza]].{{sfn|Heine|2000|p=245}} Dogen, the founder of Soto in Japan, emphasized that practice and awakening cannot be separated. By practicing shikantaza, attainment and Buddhahood are already being expressed.{{sfn|Tomoaki|2003|p=280}} For Dogen, zazen, or shikantaza, is the essence of Buddhist practice.{{sfn|Tomoaki|2003|p=284}} Gradual cultivation was also recognized by Dongshan Liangjie.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite news|title=Soto Zen|url=http://szba.org/soto-zen/|publisher=The Soto Zen Buddhist Association|accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zen scripture==
{{main article|Zen and Sutras}}

===The role of scripture in Zen===
Contrary to the popular image, literature does play a role in the Zen-training. Zen is deeply rooted in the teachings and doctrines of Mahāyāna Buddhism.{{sfn|Low|2000}} ''Unsui'', Zen-monks, "are expected to become familiar with the classics of the Zen canon".{{sfn|Sharf|1995c|p=427}} A review of the early historical documents and literature of early Zen masters clearly reveals that they were well versed in numerous Mahāyāna Buddhist sūtras,{{sfn|Poceski|Year unknown}}{{refn|group=note|Sasaki's translation of the Linji yulu contains an extensive biography of 62 pages, listing influential Chinese Buddhist texts which played a role in Song dynasty Chán.{{sfn|Sasaki|2009}}}}{{refn|group=note|Albert Low: "It is evident that the masters were well versed in the sutras. Zen master Tokusan, for example, knew the ''Diamond Sutra'' well and, before meeting with his own Zen master, lectured upon it extensively; the founder of the Zen sect, Bodhidharma, the very one who preached selfrealization outside the scriptures, nevertheless advocated the ''Lankavatara Sutra''; Zen master Hogen knew the ''Avatamsaka Sutra'' well, and koan twenty-six in the ''Mumonkan'', in which Hogen is involved, comes out of the teaching of that sutra. Other koans, too, make reference directly or indirectly to the sutras. The autobiography of yet another Zen master, Hui Neng, subsequently became the ''Platform Sutra'', one of those sutras so condemned by those who reject intellectual and sutra studies"{{sfn|Low|2000|p=4}}}}{{sfn|Poceski|Year unknown}}{{refn|group=note|Poceski: "Direct references to specific scriptures are relatively rare in the records of Mazu and his disciples, but that does not mean that they rejected the canon or repudiated its authority. On the contrary, one of the striking features of their records is that they are filled with scriptural quotations and allusions, even though the full extent of their usage of canonical sources is not immediately obvious and its discernment requires familiarity with Buddhist literature." See source for a full-length example from "one of Mazu's sermons", in which can be found references to the Vimalakīrti Scripture, the Huayan Scripture, the Mahāsamnipata-sūtra, the Foshuo Foming Scripture 佛說佛名經, the Lankāvatāra scripture and the Faju jing.{{sfn|Poceski|Year unknown}}}} including Madhyamaka.{{sfn|Cheng|1981}} Especially the [[Lotus Sutra]] played a large role in the development of East Asian Buddhism, including Zen.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/important-new-translation-complete-lotus-sutra/ |website=tricycle.org |title=An Important New Translation of the Complete Lotus Sutra |date=December 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Zen is often pictured as anti-intellectual.{{sfn|Low|2000}} This [[Zen#Zen narratives|picture of Zen]] emerged during the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1297), when Chán became the dominant form of Buddhism in China, and gained great popularity among the educated and literary classes of Chinese society. The use of koans, which are highly stylized literary texts, reflects this popularity among the higher classes.{{sfn|McRae|2003}} The famous saying "do not establish words and letters", attributed in this period to Bodhidharma,{{sfn|Welter|2000}}
{{quote|...was taken not as a denial of the recorded words of the Buddha or the doctrinal elaborations by learned monks, but as a warning to those who had become confused about the relationship between Buddhist teaching as a guide to the truth and mistook it for the truth itself.{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=94}}}}

What the Zen tradition emphasizes is that the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment of the Buddha]] came not through conceptualization but rather through direct insight.{{sfn|Yanagida|2009|p=62}} But direct insight has to be supported by study and understanding (''hori''{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=296}}) of the Buddhist teachings and texts.{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=295-297}}{{refn|group=note|Hakuin goes as far as to state that the buddhat path even ''starts'' with study: "[A] person [...] must first gain wide-ranging knowledge, accumulate a treasure-store of wisdom by studying all the Buddhist sutras and commentaries, reading through all the classic works Buddhist and nonBuddhist and perusing the writings of the wise men of other traditions. It is for that reason the vow states "the Dharma teachings are infinite, I vow to study them all.""{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=42}}}} Intellectual understanding without practice is called ''yako-zen'', [[Wild fox koan|"wild fox Zen"]], but "one who has only experience without intellectual understanding is a ''zen temma'', 'Zen devil{{' "}}.{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=297}}

===Grounding Chán in scripture===
The early Buddhist schools in China were each based on a specific sutra. At the beginning of the [[Tang Dynasty]], by the time of the Fifth Patriarch [[Daman Hongren|Hongren]] (601–674), the Zen school became established as a separate school of Buddhism.{{sfn|Ferguson|2000|p=17}} It had to develop a doctrinal tradition of its own to ascertain its position{{sfn|McRae|2003}} and to ground its teachings in a specific sutra. Various sutras were used for this even before the time of Hongren: the [[Śrīmālādevī Sūtra]] ([[Huike]]),{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=17}} [[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana|Awakening of Faith]] ([[Daoxin]]),{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=17}} the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] (East Mountain School),{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=17}}{{sfn|Poceski|Year unknown}} the [[Diamond Sutra]]{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=62}} ([[Shenhui]]),{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=17}} and the [[Platform Sutra]].{{sfn|Poceski|Year unknown}}{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=62}} None of these sutras were decisive though, since the school drew inspiration from a variety of sources.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=18}} Subsequently, the Zen tradition produced a rich corpus of written literature which has become a part of its practice and teaching. Other influential sutras are the [[Vimalakirti Sutra]],{{sfn|Domoulin-2005a|p=49-51}}{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=157-158}}{{sfn|Low|2000|p=83-112}} [[Avatamsaka Sutra]],{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=45-49}} the [[Shurangama Sutra]],{{sfn|Low|2000|p=135-154}} and the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra|Mahaparinirvana Sutra]].{{sfn|Lai|2003}}

===Zen literature===
{{See also|Zen and Sutras#Zen literature|l1=Zen literature}}

The Zen-tradition developed a rich textual tradition, based on the interpretation of the Buddhist teachings and the recorded sayings of Zen-masters. Important texts are the [[Platform Sutra]] (8th century), attributed to [[Huineng]] ;{{sfn|McRae|2003}} the Chán transmission records, teng-lu,{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=82-86}} such as ''The Records of the Transmission of the Lamp'' (Ching-te ch'uan-teng lu), compiled by Tao-yün and published in 1004;{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=83}} the "yü-lü" genre{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=192}} consisting of the recorded sayings of the masters, and the encounter dialogues; the koan-collections, such as the "Gateless Gate" and the "Blue Cliff Record".

==Zen organization and institutions==

Religion is not only an individual matter, but "also a collective endeavour".{{sfn|Koné|2000}} Though individual experience{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}} and the iconoclastic picture of Zen{{sfn|McRae|2002}} are emphasised in the Western world, the Zen-tradition is maintained and transferred by a high degree of institutionalisation and hierarchy.{{sfn|Borup|2008}}{{sfn|Hori|1994}} In Japan, modernity has led to criticism of the formal system and the commencement of lay-oriented Zen-schools such as the [[Sanbo Kyodan]]{{sfn|Sharf|1995c}} and the [[Ryomo Kyokai|Ningen Zen Kyodan]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web |author=aqua-palette,Inc. |url=http://www.ningen-zen.com/ningen-zen/home.shtml |title=Ningen Zen |publisher=Ningen Zen |accessdate=2013-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316112314/http://www.ningen-zen.com/ningen-zen/home.shtml |archivedate=2013-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; How to organize the continuity of the Zen-tradition in the West, constraining [[charismatic authority]] and the derailment it may bring on the one hand,{{sfn|Bell|2002}}{{sfn|Lachs|1999}}{{sfn|Lachs|2006}} and maintaining the legitimacy and authority by limiting the number of authorized teachers on the other hand,{{sfn|Koné|2000}} is a challenge for the developing Zen-communities in the West.

{{Main article|Zen Narratives}}

The Chán of the [[Tang Dynasty]], especially that of [[Mazu Daoyi|Mazu]] and [[Linji Yixuan|Linji]] with its emphasis on "shock techniques", in retrospect was seen as a golden age of Chán.{{sfn|McRae|2003}} This picture has gained great popularity in the West in the 20th century, especially due to the influence of [[D.T. Suzuki]],{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and further popularized by [[Hakuun Yasutani]] and the [[Sanbo Kyodan]].{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}} This picture has been challenged, and complemented, since the 1970s by modern scientific research on Zen.{{sfn|Sharf|1993}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995}}{{sfn|McRae|2003}}{{sfn|McRae|2005}}{{sfn|Heine|2007}}{{sfn|Jorgensen|1991}}

== History of Zen ==

=== Chinese Chán ===
{{main article|Chinese Chán}}{{See also|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}

====Periodisation====
The history of Chán in China can be divided into several periods. Zen as we know it today is the result of a long history, with many changes and contingent factors. Each period had different types of Zen, some of which remained influential while others vanished.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2000}}

Ferguson distinguishes three periods from the 5th century into the 13th century:
# The '''Legendary period''', from Bodhidharma in the late 5th century to the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] around 765 CE, in the middle of the [[Tang Dynasty]]. Little written information is left from this period.{{sfn|Ferguson|2000|p=3}} It is the time of the Six Patriarchs, including [[Bodhidharma]] and [[Huineng]], and the legendary "split" between the Northern and the Southern School of Chán.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}
# The '''Classical period''', from the end of the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] around 765 CE to the beginning of the [[Song Dynasty]] around 950 CE.{{sfn|Ferguson|2000|p=3}} This is the time of the great masters of Chán, such as [[Mazu Daoyi]] and [[Linji Yixuan]], and the creation of the ''yü-lü'' genre, the recordings of the sayings and teachings of these great masters.
# The '''Literary period''', from around 950 to 1250,{{sfn|Ferguson|2000|p=3}} which spans the era of the Song Dynasty (960–1279). In this time the [[Koan|gongan-collections]] were compiled, collections of sayings and deeds by the famous masters, appended with poetry and commentary. This genre reflects the influence of ''literati'' on the development of Chán. This period idealized the previous period as the "golden age" of Chán, producing the literature in which the spontaneity of the celebrated masters was portrayed.

Although McRae has reservations about the division of Chán-history in phases or periods,{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=11-15}} he nevertheless distinguishes four phases in the history of Chán:{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=11-21}}
# '''Proto-Chán''' (c. 500–600) ([[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] (420 to 589) and [[Sui Dynasty]] (589–618 CE)). In this phase, Chán developed in multiple locations in northern China. It was based on the practice of ''dhyana'' and is connected to the figures of Bodhidharma and Huike.

#'''Early Chán''' (c. 600–900) ([[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907 CE)). In this phase Chán took its first clear contours. Prime figures are the fifth patriarch [[Daman Hongren]] (601–674), his dharma-heir [[Yuquan Shenxiu]] (606?–706), the sixth patriarch [[Huineng]] (638–713), protagonist of the quintessential [[Platform Sutra]], and [[Shenhui]] (670–762), whose propaganda elevated Huineng to the status of sixth patriarch. Prime factions are the [[East Mountain Teaching|Northern School, Southern School and Oxhead School]].{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=13, 17–18}}
# '''Middle Chán''' (c. 750–1000) (from [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (755–763) till [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]  (907–960/979)). In this phase developed the well-known Chán of the iconoclastic zen-masters. Prime figures are [[Mazu Daoyi]] (709–788), [[Shitou Xiqian]] (710–790), [[Linji Yixuan]] (died 867), and [[Xuefeng Yicun]] (822–908). Prime factions are the [[Hongzhou school]] and the Hubei faction{{refn|group=note|McRae gives no further information on this "Hubei faction".

# '''[[Song Dynasty]]''' Chán (c. 950–1300). In this phase Chán took its definitive shape including the picture of the "golden age" of the Chán of the Tang-Dynasty, and the use of koans for individual study and meditation. Prime figures are [[Dahui Zonggao]] (1089–1163) who introduced the [[Hua Tou]] practice and [[Hongzhi Zhengjue]] (1091–1157) who emphasized [[Shikantaza]]. Prime factions are the [[Rinzai school|Linji school]] and the [[Caodong school]]. The classic koan-collections, such as the [[Blue Cliff Record]] were assembled in this period,{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=13, 19–21}} which reflect the influence of the "literati" on the development of Chán.{{sfn|Gimello|1994}}{{sfn|Welter|2000}} In this phase Chán is transported to Japan, and exerts a great influence on Korean Seon via [[Jinul]].

A side effect of this imperial influence was the modernisation of Asian religions, adapting them to western ideas and rhetorical strategies.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}}}

====Origins and Taoist influences (c. 200–500)====
{{See also|Han Dynasty|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|Six Dynasties}}

[[Buddhist meditation]] was practiced in China centuries before the rise of Chán, by people such as [[An Shigao]] (c. 148–180 CE) and his school, who translated various [[Dhyāna sutras]] ((Chán-jing, 禪経, "meditation treatises"), which were influential early meditation texts mostly based on the Yogacara meditation teachings of the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] school of [[Kashmir]] circa 1st-4th centuries CE.&lt;ref name=Deleanu&gt;Deleanu, Florin (1992); [https://ahandfulofleaves.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mindfulness-of-breathing-in-the-dhayana-sutra_florin-deleanu_1992.pdf Mindfulness of Breathing in the Dhyāna Sūtras]. Transactions of the International Conference of Orientalists in Japan (TICOJ) 37, 42-57.&lt;/ref&gt;. The five [[Kammaṭṭhāna|main types of meditation]] in the ''Dyana sutras'' are [[anapanasati]] (mindfulness of breathing); [[patikulamanasikara|paṭikūlamanasikāra]] meditation, mindfulness of the impurities of the body; loving-kindness [[mettā|maitrī]] meditation; the contemplation on the twelve links of [[pratītyasamutpāda]]; and the contemplation on the [[Physical characteristics of the Buddha#The 32 Signs of a Great Man|Buddha’s thirty-two Characteristics]].&lt;ref name=Yuanci&gt;Ven.

When Buddhism came to China from [[Greco-Buddhism#Gandharan proselytism|Gandhara]] (now Afghanistan) and [[India]], it was initially adapted to the Chinese culture and understanding. Buddhism was exposed to [[Confucianism|Confucianist]]{{sfn|Brown Holt|1995}} and [[Taoism|Taoist]]{{sfn|Goddard |2007|p=10}}{{sfn|Verstappen|2004|p=5}}{{sfn|Fowler|2005|p=79}}{{sfn|Grigg|1994}} influences.{{refn|group=note|See also [[The Tao of Zen]] which argues that Zen is almost entirely grounded in Taoist philosophy, though this fact is well covered by Mahayana Buddhism.{{sfn|Grigg|1994}}}} Goddard quotes [[D.T. Suzuki]],{{refn|group=note|Godard did not provide a source for this quote.}} calling Chán a "natural evolution of Buddhism under Taoist conditions."{{sfn|Goddard|2007|p=11}} Buddhism was first identified to be "a barbarian variant of Taoism":{{sfn|Fowler|2005|p=79}} 
{{quote|Judging from the reception by the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] of the Hinayana works and from the early commentaries, it appears that Buddhism was being perceived and digested through the medium of religious Daoism (Taoism). Buddha was seen as a foreign immortal who had achieved some form of Daoist nondeath. The Buddhists’ mindfulness of the breath was regarded as an extension of Daoist breathing exercises.{{sfn|Lai|2003}}}}

Taoist terminology was used to express Buddhist doctrines in the oldest translations of Buddhist texts,{{sfn|Fowler|2005|p=79}} a practice termed ''ko-i'', "matching the concepts",{{sfn|Oh|2000}} while the emerging Chinese Buddhism had to compete with Taoism and Confucianism.{{sfn|Brown Holt|1995}}

The first Buddhist recruits in China were Taoists.{{sfn|Fowler|2005|p=79}} They developed high esteem for the newly introduced Buddhist meditational techniques,{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=65}} and blended them with [[Neidan|Taoist meditation]].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=64}} Representatives of early Chinese Buddhism like [[Sengzhao]] and [[Tao Sheng]] were deeply influenced by the Taoist keystone works of [[Laozi]] and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|pp=70&amp;74}} Against this background, especially the Taoist concept of ''[[Taoism#Naturalness|naturalness]]'' was inherited by the early Chán disciples:{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=167}} they equated – to some extent – the ineffable [[Tao]] and [[Buddha-nature]],{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a |p=168}} and thus, rather than feeling bound to the abstract "wisdom of the sūtras", emphasized Buddha-nature to be found in "everyday" human life, just like the Tao.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=168}}

In addition to Taoist ideas, also [[Neo-Daoism|Neo-Taoist]] concepts were taken over in Chinese Buddhism.{{sfn|Oh|2000}} Concepts such as [[Essence-Function|"T’i -yung"]] (Essence and Function) and "Li-shih" (Noumenon and Phenomenon) were first taken over by Hua-yen Buddhism,{{sfn|Oh|2000}} which consequently influenced Chán deeply.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=45-49}}

One point of confusion for Chinese Buddhism was the two truths doctrine. Chinese thinking took this to refer to two ''ontological truths'': reality exists on two levels, a relative level and an absolute level.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}} Taoists at first misunderstood [[sunyata]] to be akin to the Taoist non-being.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=8}} In Madhyamaka the two truths are two ''epistemological truths'': two different ways to look at reality. Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths.{{sfn|Lai|2003}}

====Legendary or Proto-Chán – Six Patriarchs (c. 500–600)====
{{Main article|Bodhidharma|Southern and Northern Dynasties|Sui Dynasty}}

Traditionally the origin of Chán in China is credited to [[Bodhidharma]], an [[Iranian languages|Iranian language speaking]] [[Buddhism in Central Asia|Central Asian monk]]{{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=54-55}} or an Indian monk.{{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=8}} The story of his life, and of the Six Patriarchs, was constructed during the [[Tang Dynasty]] to lend credibility to the growing Chán-school.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}

[[File:BodhidharmaYoshitoshi1887.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Bodhidharma]]. [[Woodcut]] print by [[Yoshitoshi]] (Japanese), 1887.]]
Bodhidharma is recorded as having come into China during the time of [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] to teach a "special transmission outside scriptures" which "did not stand upon words".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=85-94}} Throughout [[Buddhist art]], Bodhidharma is depicted as a rather ill-tempered, profusely bearded and wide-eyed barbarian. He is referred as "The Blue-Eyed [[Barbarian]]" (碧眼胡:Bìyǎn hú) in Chinese Chan texts.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140303182232/http://buddhistinformatics.ddbc.edu.tw/glossaries/files/soothill-hodous.ddbc.pdf Soothill, William Edward; Hodous, Lewis (1995), A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms], London: RoutledgeCurzon&lt;/ref&gt;  Only scarce historical information is available about him but his hagiography developed when the Chan tradition grew stronger and gained prominence in the early 8th century. By this time a lineage of the six ancestral founders of Chán in China was developed.{{sfn|McRae|2003}} The short text ''[[Two Entrances and Four Acts]]'', written by T'an-lín (曇林; 506–574), contains teachings which are attributed to Bodhidharma. The text is known from the [[Dunhuang|Dunhuang-manuscripts]].

The actual origins of Chán may lie in ascetic practitioners of Buddhism, who found refuge in forests and mountains.{{sfn|Whalen Lai|1985}} [[Huike]], "a dhuta (extreme ascetic) who schooled others"{{sfn|Whalen Lai|1985}} and used the [[Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra|Srimala Sutra]],{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=17}} one of the [[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras]] ,{{sfn|McRae|2004}} figures in the stories about Bodhidharma. Huike is regarded as the second Chán patriarch, appointed by Bodhidharma to succeed him. One of Huike's students, [[Sengcan]], to whom is ascribed the [[Xinxin Ming]], is regarded as the third patriarch.

====Early Chán – Tang Dynasty (c. 600–900)====
{{See also|Tang Dynasty}}

With the fourth patriarch, [[Daoxin]] ({{lang|zh|道信}} 580–651),{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=17}} Chán began to take shape as a distinct school. The link between Huike and Sengcan, and the fourth patriarch Daoxin "is far from clear and remains tenuous".{{sfn|Whalen Lai|1985}} With Daoxin and his successor, the fifth patriarch [[Daman Hongren|Hongren]] ({{lang|zh|弘忍}} 601–674), there emerged a new style of teaching, which was inspired by the Chinese text [[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]].{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=17}} A large group of students gathered at a permanent residence, and extreme ascetism became outdated.{{sfn|Whalen Lai|1985}} The period of Daoxin and Hongren came to be called the [[East Mountain Teaching]], due to the location of the residence of Hongren at Huamgmei.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a}}{{sfn|McRae|2003}}

The term "East Mountain Teaching" was used by [[Yuquan Shenxiu|Shenxiu]] (神秀 606?–706), the most important successor to Hongren. By this time the group had grown into a matured congregation which became significant enough to be reckoned with by the ruling forces.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=17}} In 701 Shenxiu was invited to the Imperial Court by Empress Wu, who paid him imperial reverence. This gave his school the support and the legitimation of the imperial court.{{sfn|McRae|2003|pp=33–36}}  The school was typified by a "loose practice,"{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=18}} aiming to make meditation accessible to a larger audience.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=18}} Shenxiu used short formulas extracted from various sutras to package the teachings,{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=18}} a style which is also used in the Platform Sutra.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=18}} Members of the "East Mountain Teaching" shifted the alleged scriptural basis, realizing that the ''Awwakening of Faith'' is not a sutra but a ''[[sastra]]'', commentary, and fabricated a lineage of [[Lankavatara Sutra]] masters, as being the sutra that preluded the ''Awakening of Faith''.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=17}}

This growing influence, and the need to be supported by patrons, is reflected in the campaign of [[Shenhui]] (670–762) for imperial patronage.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=17}} Shenhui was a successor to [[Hui-neng]] (惠能; 638–713), a minor student of Hongren.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a}}{{sfn|McRae|2003}} At 731 Shenhui started to propagate that Huineng was the real successor of Hongren's, instead of the then publicly recognized successor Shenxiu.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a}} A dramatic story of Huineng's life was created, as narrated in the [[Platform Sutra]], which tells that there was a contest for the transmission of the title of patriarch. After being chosen by [[Daman Hongren|Hongren]], the fifth patriarch, Huineng had to flee by night to [[Nanhua Temple]] in the south to avoid the wrath of Hongren's jealous senior disciples.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a}} The ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' was incorporated into the story as being the favorite sutra of Huineng, thereby shifting the alleged textual basis of the Chán-school again.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=17-18}} Shenhui succeeded in his campaign, and Huineng came to be regarded as the Sixth Patriarch.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a}}{{sfn|McRae|2003}} Shenxiu's Northern School was denigrated as "gradual", in opposition to the self-acclaimed "[[Subitism|sudden]]" approach of Shenhui's Southern School. Shenhui's story was so influential that all surviving schools regard Huineng as their ancestor. {{sfn|McRae|2003}}{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a}}

The [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (755–763) led to a loss of control by the Tang-dynasty, and changed the Chan scene again. Metropolitan Chan began to lose its status, while "other schools were arising in out-lying areas controlled by warlords. These are the forerunners of the Chan we know today."{{sfn|Yampolski|2003a|p=11}}

The most important of these schools is the [[Hongzhou school]] (洪州宗) of [[Mazu Daoyi|Mazu]], to which also belong [[Shitou Xiqian|Shitou]], [[Baizhang]], [[Huangbo Xiyun|Huangbo]] and [[Linji Yixuan|Linji]]. This school became the archetypal expression of Zen, with its emphasis on the personal expression of insight, and its rejection of positive statements of this insight.{{sfn|Whalen Lai|1985}} Shitou is regarded as the Patriarch of [[Caodong]] (Jp. [[Sōtō]]), while Linji is regarded as the founder of [[Rinzai school|Rinzai-Zen]].

During 845–846 [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]] persecuted the Buddhist schools in China.{{sfn|Yampolski|2003a|p=15}} This persecution was devastating for metropolitan Chan, but the Chan school of Mazu and his likes survived, and took a leading role in the Chan of the later Tang.{{sfn|Yampolski|2003a|p=15}}

This surviving rural Chan developed into the [[Five Houses of Chán]] (Ch. 五家) of Zen, or five "schools". These were not originally regarded as "schools" or "sects", but historically they have come to be understood that way. Most Zen lineages throughout Asia and the rest of the world originally grew from or were heavily influenced by the original five houses of Zen.

=====Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–960/979)=====
{{See also|Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period}}

After the fall of the [[Tang Dynasty]], China was without effective central control during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period. China was divided into several autonomous regions. Support for Buddhism was limited to a few areas. The Hua-yen and T'ient-tai schools suffered from the changing circumstances, since they had depended on imperial support. The collapse of T'ang society also deprived the aristocratic classes of wealth and influence, which meant a further drawback for Buddhism. Shenxiu's Northern School and Henshui's Southern School didn't survive the changing circumstances. Nevertheless, chán emerged as the dominant stream within Chinese Buddhism, but with various schools developing various emphases in their teachings, due to the regional orientation of the period. The [[Fayan school]], named after Fa-yen Wen-i (885–958) became the dominant school in the southern kingdoms of Nan-T'ang ([[Jiangxi]], Chiang-hsi) and [[Wuyue]] (Che-chiang).{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=86-87}}

====Literary Chán – Song Dynasty (c. 960–1300)====
{{See also|Song Dynasty}}

The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period was followed by the Song Dynasty, which established a strong central government. During the Song Dynasty, Chán (禪) was used by the government to strengthen its control over the country and Chán grew to become the largest sect in [[Chinese Buddhism]]. An ideal picture of the Chán of the Tang period was produced which served the legacy of this newly acquired status, and the period of the [[Tang Dynasty]] came to be regarded as the "golden age" of Chan.{{sfn|McRae|1993|pp=119–120}}{{sfn|McRae|2003}} With the establishment of the [[Five Mountain System|Wu-shan (Gozan) system]] during the Southern Sung, the Chinese bureaucratic system entered into Zen temples throughout the country, and a highly organized system of temple rank and administration developed.{{sfn|Yampolski|2003b|p=266}}

The [[Linji school]] became the dominant school within Chán due to support from literati and the court.{{sfn|Welter|year unknownb}} Before the Song Dynasty, the Linji-school is rather obscure, and very little is known about its early history.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a}} The first mention of Linji is in the ''Zutang ji'', compiled in 952, 86 years after Linji's death.{{sfn|Welter|year unknownb}} But the ''Zutang ji'' pictures the [[Xuefeng Yicun]] lineage as heir to the legacy of Mazu and the Hongzhou-school.{{sfn|Welter|year unknownb}} According to Welter, the real founder of the Linji-school was Shoushan (or Baoying) Shengnian (首山省念)(926–993), a fourth generation dharma-heir of Linji. The ''Tiansheng Guangdeng lu'' (天聖廣燈錄), "Tiansheng Era Expanded Lamp Record", compiled by the official Li Zunxu (李遵勗)(988–1038) confirms the status of Shoushan Shengnian, but also pictures Linji as a major Chan patriarch and heir to the Mazu, displacing the prominence of the Fayan-lineage.{{sfn|Welter|year unknownb}} It also established the slogan of "a special transmission outside the teaching",  supporting the Linji-school claim of "Chan as separate from and superior to all other Buddhist teachings".{{sfn|Young|2009}}

During the 12th century, a clear difference between the Linji and the Caodong schools emerged. The two schools were competing for support of the literati, who became more powerful when the Song-government started to limit their influence on society. [[Hongzhi Zhengjue]] (1091–1157) of the Caodong-school emphasized silent illumination or [[shikantaza]] as a means for solitary practice, which could be undertaken by lay-followers. [[Dahui Zonggao]] (1089–1163) introduced [[Koan|k'an-hua practice]], "observing the word-head", as a means of solitary practice.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008}}

During the Song, both schools were exported to Japan where they eventually became two clearly distinguished schools or "sects".

====Post-Classical Chán (c. 1300 – present)====
This was different from China, where the Buddhist schools tended to coalesce into a syncretic Chinese Buddhist school.

=====Yuan Dynasty (1279–1368)=====
{{See also|Yuan Dynasty}}

The ''Yuan Dynasty'' was the empire established by [[Kublai Khan]], the leader of Mongolian [[Borjigin]] clan, after [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] conquered the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] and the [[Southern Song dynasty]] in [[China]]. Chán-teachings started to be mixed with [[Pure Land]] teachings, as in the teachings of [[Zhongfeng Mingben]] (1263–1323).

=====Ming Dynasty (1368–1644)=====
{{See also|Ming Dynasty}}

Chán Buddhism enjoyed something of a revival in the Ming Dynasty with teachers such as [[Hanshan Deqing]] (憨山德清), who wrote and taught extensively on both Chán and Pure Land Buddhism; [[Miyun Yuanwu (17th century)|Miyun Yuanwu]] (密雲圓悟), who came to be seen posthumously as the first patriarch of the [[Ōbaku|Ōbaku Zen]] school; as well as [[Yunqi Zhuhong]] (雲棲祩宏) and [[Ouyi Zhixu]] (蕅益智旭).

Chán was taught alongside [[Pure Land Buddhism]] in many Chinese Buddhist monasteries. In time much of the distinction between them was lost, and many masters taught both Chán and Pure Land.{{sfn|Sharf|2002}}

With the downfall of the Ming Dynasty several Chinese Chán-masters fled to Japan, founding the [[Ōbaku|Ōbaku school]].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=299}}

=====Qing Dynasty (1644–1912)=====
{{See also|Qing Dynasty}}

The Qing Dynasty was the last imperial [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasty]] of [[China]].

In the beginning of the Qing Dynasty Chán was "reinvented", by the "revival of beating and shouting practices" by Miyun Yuanwu
(1566–1642), and the publication of the ''Wudeng yantong'' ("The strict transmission of the five Chan schools") by Feiyin
Tongrong’s (1593–1662), a dharma heir of Miyun Yuanwu. The book placed self-proclaimed Chan monks without proper Dharma transmission in the category of "lineage unknown" (''sifa weixiang''), thereby excluding several prominent Caodong-monks.{{sfn|Meng-Tat Chia|2011}}

[[File:Shuixin Zen Temple - DSCF8739.JPG|thumb|Shuixin Chán Temple in [[Anhai]] Town, Fujian, China]]
After further centuries of decline during the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644–1912), Chán was revived again in the early 20th century by [[Hsu Yun]] (虛雲) (1840–1959), a well-known figure of 20th-century Chinese Buddhism. Many Chán teachers today trace their lineage back to Hsu Yun, including [[Sheng-yen]] (聖嚴) and [[Hsuan Hua]] (宣化), who have propagated Chán in the West where it has grown steadily through the 20th and 21st centuries.

Chán was repressed in China during the 1960s in the Cultural Revolution, but subsequently has been re-asserting itself{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} on the mainland, and has a significant following in [[Taiwan]] and [[Hong Kong]] as well as among [[Overseas Chinese]].

According to traditional accounts of Vietnam, in 580 an [[India]]n monk named [[Vinitaruci]] ({{lang-vi|Tì-ni-đa-lưu-chi}}) travelled to Vietnam after completing his studies with [[Sengcan]], the third patriarch of Chinese Chán. This, then, would be the first appearance of Vietnamese Thiền Buddhism. Other early Vietnamese Chán schools included the [[Vo Ngon Thong|Vô Ngôn Thông]], which was associated with the teaching of Mazu, and the [[Thao Duong|Thảo Đường]], which incorporated ''[[nianfo]]'' chanting techniques; both were founded by Chinese monks.

Seon was gradually transmitted into Korea during the late [[Silla]] period (7th through 9th centuries) as Korean monks of predominantly [[Hwaeom]] (華嚴) and [[Consciousness-only]] (唯識) background began to travel to China to learn the newly developing tradition. Seon received its most significant impetus and consolidation from the [[Goryeo]] monk [[Jinul]] (知訥) (1158–1210), who established a reform movement and introduced [[koan]] practice to Korea. Jinul established the [[Songgwangsa]] (松廣寺) as a new center of pure practice.

====Zen in Japan====

[[File:Sunriseatsojiji.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Sojiji Temple, of the [[Soto Zen]] school, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, [[Japan]]]]

Zen was not introduced as a separate school until the 12th century, when [[Myōan Eisai]] traveled to China and returned to establish a Linji lineage, which eventually perished.&lt;ref group=web name=ROZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zen.rinnou.net/whats_zen/history.html#The%20Transmission%20of%20Zen%20to%20Japan |title=Rinzai-Obaku Zen – What is Zen? – History |publisher=Zen.rinnou.net |accessdate=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, {{Nihongo|[[Nanpo Shōmyō]]|南浦紹明}} (1235–1308) also studied Linji teachings in China before founding the Japanese [[Otokan]] lineage, the most influential and only surviving lineage of [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]] in Japan.&lt;ref group=web name=ROZ /&gt; In 1215, [[Dōgen]], a younger contemporary of Eisai's, journeyed to China himself, where he became a disciple of the Caodong master [[Tiantong Rujing]]. After his return, [[Dōgen]] established the [[Sōtō]] school, the Japanese branch of Caodong.

The three traditional schools of Zen in contemporary [[Japan]] are the {{Nihongo||曹洞|[[Sōtō]]}}, {{Nihongo||臨済|[[Rinzai]]}}, and {{Nihongo||黃檗|[[Ōbaku]]}}. Of these, Sōtō is the largest, and Ōbaku the smallest, with Rinzai in the middle. These schools are further divided into subschools by head temple, with two head temples for Sōtō ([[Sōji-ji]] and [[Eihei-ji]], with Sōji-ji having a much larger network), fourteen head temples for Rinzai, and one head temple ([[Manpuku-ji]]) for Ōbaku, for a total of 17 head temples. The Rinzai head temples, which are most numerous, have substantial overlap with the traditional [[Five Mountain System]], and include [[Myoshin-ji]], [[Nanzen-ji]], [[Tenryū-ji]], [[Daitoku-ji]], and [[Tofuku-ji]], among others.

Besides these traditional organizations, there are modern Zen organisations which have especially attracted Western lay followers, namely the [[Sanbo Kyodan]] and the FAS Society.

====Zen in the Western world====
{{See also|Buddhism in the West|Zen in the United States}}

Although it is difficult to trace the precise moment when the West first became aware of Zen as a distinct form of Buddhism, the visit of [[Soyen Shaku]], a Japanese Zen monk, to [[Chicago]] during the [[World Parliament of Religions]] in 1893 is often pointed to as an event that enhanced the profile of Zen in the Western world. It was during the late 1950s and the early 1960s that the number of Westerners other than the descendants of Asian immigrants who were pursuing a serious interest in Zen began to reach a significant level. [[Japanese Zen]] has gained the greatest popularity in the West. The various books on Zen by [[Reginald Horace Blyth]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Philip Kapleau]] and [[D. T. Suzuki]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} published between 1950 and 1975, contributed to this growing interest in Zen in the West, as did the interest on the part of beat poets such as [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Gary Snyder]].{{sfn|Aitken|1994}} In 1958, the literary magazine ''[[Chicago Review]]''  played a significant role in introducing Zen to the American literary community&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Nock-Hee Park, ''Apparitions of Asia: modernist form and Asian American poetics'', p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; when it published a special issue&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan W. “Beat Zen, Square Zen, and Zen.” ''Chicago Review'', vol. 12, no. 2, 1958, pp. 3–11. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/25293448.&lt;/ref&gt; on Zen featuring the aforementioned beat poets and works in translation.
