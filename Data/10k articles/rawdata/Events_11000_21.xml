The '''100th Anniversary of the Estonian Republic''' (or more commonly used '''Estonia 100''') is an official government program for the celebration of the [[Republic of Estonia]]'s 100th [[anniversary]]. The official birthday of the Republic of Estonian Republic is on February&amp;nbsp;24,&amp;nbsp;2018, the centennial will be marked from April 2017 to February 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ev100.ee/en/centenary|title=Centenary|date=5 May 2017|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
{{further|History of Estonia}}

On 12 February 1919, The Estonian Provisional Government decided to consider 24 February to be the date of the independence of Estonia from [[Russian Empire|Russia]] which occurred when [[World War I]] was nearing its end. However, Estonia's independence came to a ''de facto'' end during [[World War II]] when the country was illegally occupied and annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1940, then [[Nazi Germany]] in 1941 and returned to Soviet rule in 1944 when it became the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. As a result, an [[Estonian government-in-exile|government in exile]] was established.

As the [[Glasnost|political upheavals taking place]] throughout the Soviet Union in the 1980s, during the events of ''[[Baltic Way]]'', Estonia declared sovereignty on its territory in 1988, which restored its ''de facto'' independence on 8 May 1990 and declared Soviet rule illegal. Following the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|aborted coup]] in [[Moscow]], the country's full ''de facto'' independence was restored after the Soviet troops failed to seize the [[Tallinn TV Tower]] on 20 August 1991. The [[State Council of the Soviet Union|Soviet State Council]] recognized the Estonian independence on 6 September 1991. Since 2004, Estonia has been a member of [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]].

== Events ==
The birthday celebrations of the Republic of Estonia will take place over the next 3 years. The celebrations will kick off in April&amp;nbsp;2017 to mark a century since Estonia's administrative borders took their current form, will peak while events on various important dates take place throughout 2018 and 2019, and come to a grand close on the 2nd February 2020 when the 100th anniversary of the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Tartu Peace Treaty]] will be honoured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ev100.ee/en/Node/149|title=Invitation to the birthday celebrations of the Republic of Estonia|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Centennial Parade ==
A military parade on [[Freedom Square, Tallinn|Freedom Square]] in [[Tallinn]] was held on the occasion of the 100th anniversary. 1,100 troops and more than 100&amp;nbsp;pieces of military equipment took part in the parade. The parade was led by Gen. [[Riho Terras]], President [[Kersti Kaljulaid]] was present to greet the different units.

All service branches of the Estonian Defence Forces took part in the parade as well as soldiers from countries from NATO and other military partners of Estonia.

'''''101 Vagina''''' is a black-and-white [[Coffee table book|coffee table]] [[photo-book]] by Philip Werner, with a foreword by [[Toni Childs]]. It was [[Self-publishing|self-published]] in March 2013 in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. The book contains 101 close-up nude photos shot in a non-provocative way, along with an accompanying story or message written by each woman about her vagina.

The book's photos and stories were exhibited five times in Australia in 2013, with a US and Canadian tour in 2014 taking in six locations.

== Publication ==
''101 Vagina'' was funded by [[crowd sourcing]] and took some two years to create.&lt;ref name="The Age Carbone"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carbone|first1=Suzanne|title=Here's a lesson on vaginas 101|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/melbourne-life/heres-a-lesson-on-vaginas-101-20130313-2g0ng.html|accessdate=29 June 2014|publisher=The Age|date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LBCP Hansen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hansen|first1=David|title=Hansen: The Shame and Joy of 101 Vaginas|url=http://www.coastlinepilot.com/opinion/tn-cpt-me-0425-hansen-20140424,0,144764.story|accessdate=29 June 2014|publisher=Laguna Beach Coastline Pilot|date=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Werner was initially inspired by ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' and subjects were found via [[social media]] after Werner publicised his objective to create a book that had both an educational and celebratory goal.&lt;ref name="The Age Carbone"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Price|first1=Jenna|title=Bodybits 101: the personal side of Selfies|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/federal-politics/bodybits-101-the-personal-side-of-selfies-20121119-29m6x.html|work=Canberra Times|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Models, ranging in age from 18 to 65, remain anonymous. Singer-songwriter Toni Childs, who wrote the foreword, made contact with Werner after he initiated a [[peace march]] in honour of murdered [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] employee [[Death of Jill Meagher|Jill Meagher]] in his [[Brunswick, Victoria]] neighbourhood.&lt;ref name="HS Robson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robson|first1=Suzanne|title=Private parts go public for a cause in coffee table book|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/north/private-parts-go-for-a-public-cause-in-coffee-table-book/story-fnglenug-1226598417523|accessdate=29 June 2014|publisher=Herald Sun|date=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to  ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' about the book, Werner commented that: "I hope it finds its way to a few young women and girls...So they see that [these pictures are] normal rather than pictures in magazines."&lt;ref name="SMH Berry"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berry|first1=Sarah|title=Private parts go public|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life/private-parts-go-public-20130320-2gfks.html|accessdate=29 June 2014|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Stories accompanying the photos discuss various themes, including ageing, pregnancy, [[Bikini waxing#Brazilian waxing|Brazilian waxing]], [[virginity|first sexual encounter]] and poor [[body image]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bielski|first1=Zosia|title=Controversial exhibit unveils natural beauty of 101 women|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/relationships/controversial-exhibit-unveils-natural-beauty-of-101-women/article19147999/|work=Globe and Mail|publisher=Globe and Mail|date=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, unknown assailants in al-Ahsa governorate in the Eastern Province attacked a procession during Ashoura and killed eight Shias, including children, and left over 30 people wounded.

On 21 January 2011, an unidentified 65-year-old man died after setting himself on fire in the town of [[Samtah]], [[Jizan]]. This was apparently the kingdom's first known case of [[self-immolation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12260465 |title=Man dies after setting himself on fire in Saudi Arabia |publisher=BBC |date=23 January 2011 |accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 2012, a Bangladeshi man was shot dead in the [[Al-Awamiyah]] district of eastern Saudi Arabia. Saudi police said that the Bangladeshi man was driving when his car was hit by bullets fired at two security patrol cars. However, an activist in Al-Awamiyah gave a different account of the incident, saying the man had been killed by gunfire when security forces stormed a house while trying to arrest one of the 23 wanted activist for organising protest in Qatif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news/international/Bangladeshi_man_shot_dead_in_Shiite_area_of_Saudi_Arabia.html?cid=33494664 |title=Bangladeshi man shot dead in Shi'ite area of Saudi Arabia- swissinfo |publisher=Swissinfo.ch |date=11 September 2012 |accessdate=20 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024223136/http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news/international/Bangladeshi_man_shot_dead_in_Shiite_area_of_Saudi_Arabia.html?cid=33494664 |archivedate=24 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 February 2011, a [[Reuters]] report claimed that 10 intellectuals, [[human rights in Saudi Arabia|human rights]] activists and lawyers came together to create the [[Umma Islamic Party]] – considered to be the first political party in Saudi Arabia since the 1990s – to demand the end of [[absolute monarchy]] in the country.&lt;ref name="threuters_umma_created"/&gt; On 18 February however, all ten members of the party were arrested and ordered to withdraw demands for political reform in exchange for their release.&lt;ref name="washpo_umma" /&gt;

On 23 February, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, after returning to the country following three months spent abroad for health treatment, announced a series of benefits for citizens amounting to $10.7 billion. These include funding to offset high inflation and to aid young unemployed people and Saudi citizens studying abroad, as well as writing off some loans. State employees' incomes were increased by 15 percent and new housing loans subsidies were introduced. No political reforms were announced as part of the package, though the 86-year-old monarch did pardon some prisoners indicted in financial crimes.&lt;ref name="AlJazeeraEnglishBenefits"&gt;{{cite news |title=Saudi king announces new benefits |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/2011223105328424268.html |publisher=Al Jazeera|date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=23 February 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110224181607/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/2011223105328424268.html| archivedate= 24 February 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 March, the [[Council of Senior Scholars of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabian Council of Senior Scholars]], headed by [[Grand Mufti]] [[Abdul-Azeez ibn Abdullaah Aal ash-Shaikh|Abd al-'Aziz al-Ashaikh]], issued a [[fatwā]] (religious opinion) opposing petitions and demonstrations, declaring, "Therefore the council hereby reaffirms that only the reform and [counsel] that has its legitimacy is that which may bring welfare and avert the evil, whereas it is illegal to issue statements and take signatures for the purposes of intimidation and inciting the strife. ... reform should not be by demonstrations and other means and methods that give rise to unrest and divide the community. ...

On 9 March, Foreign Minister [[Saud Al Faisal]] stated that the government would not tolerate any street protests against it, while also saying that the "best way to achieve demands is through national dialogue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thousands stage rally in Bahrain |publisher=Al Jazeera|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/20113917595654981.html|date=9 March 2011 |accessdate=9 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110310104859/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/20113917595654981.html| archivedate= 10 March 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{Flagu|Russia}} – On 12 July 2012, K.K. Dolgov, human rights representative of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], expressed "great concern" about the July events in the Eastern Province. He stated, "We expect that the authorities of the Kingdom will undertake all necessary measures to settle the situation in its eastern regions, to avoid conflict, including confrontation on interconfessional basis, and to ensure the observance of conventional human rights, including the right for freedom of expression of opinion, peaceful demonstrations and freedom of associations, as it is prescribed by the law."&lt;ref name="Akhbar_RU_concern" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RuMin_RU_concern" /&gt;

*{{Flagu|Canada}} – On 21 July 2012, 30 people protested in front of the United States (US) Embassy in [[Toronto]] against US support of the Saudi Arabian government. A protest organiser claimed that the Saudi government was hypocritical because "Saudi Arabia says [it] support[s] Syria's push for freedom [in the [[Syrian uprising (2011–present)|Syrian uprising]]], but [it] repress[es] [its] own citizens". He called for the release of [[Nimr al-Nimr]].&lt;ref name="Toronto_solidarityJul2012" /&gt;

====Other====
Exiled Saudi physicist and political dissident [[Mohammad al-Massari]] described police attacks on women in 3 March 2011 Qatif demonstration as a strategic error, saying, "They made a stupid mistake by attacking women and so on because they think Shia women do not have ... the honor protection like the rest of the women in the country. But attacking women in Saudi Arabia, in an Islamic country is very severe, very negative and catastrophic ... and this will have dire repercussions."&lt;ref name="Qatif_women" /&gt;

The '''Alexisonfire Farewell Tour''' was a [[concert tour]] by Canadian [[post-hardcore]] band [[Alexisonfire]], taking place in December 2012. After their tour in 2010, band member [[Dallas Green (musician)|Dallas Green]] expressed his desire to leave the band. The band officially announced their break-up in August 2011 and also announced plans of doing one last farewell tour before officially disbanding. The farewell tour was officially announced on August 9, 2012, when the band revealed the tour dates to take place in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://exclaim.ca/News/alexisonfire_reveal_final_farewell_tour&lt;/ref&gt;

The band commented that the tour was short due to December being the only available time window for all five members when they were free from any other commitments, especially [[Dallas Green (musician)|Dallas Green]] who was touring with [[City and Colour]] and [[Wade MacNeil]] who was touring with [[Gallows (band)|Gallows]].

On August 17, 2012, after the tickets for the [[London]] date were sold out in just 5 minutes, the band announced that they added another London date at the same venue, a day before, on December 2, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.facebook.com/AOFofficial/posts/269760026467074&lt;/ref&gt;

The band reunited in 2015.

The '''Battle of Himera''' (480 BC), supposedly fought on the same day as the more famous [[Battle of Salamis]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt.+7.166.1 7.166]&lt;/ref&gt; or at the same time as the [[Battle of Thermopylae]],&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Diod.+11.24.1 11.24.1]&lt;/ref&gt; saw the Greek forces of [[Gelo]]n, King of Syracuse, and Theron, tyrant of [[Agrigento|Agrigentum]], defeat the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] force of [[Hamilcar I of Carthage|Hamilcar]] the [[Magonids|Magonid]], ending a Carthaginian bid to restore the deposed tyrant of Himera. The alleged coincidence of this battle with the naval battle of Salamis and the resultant derailing of a Punic-Persian conspiracy aimed at destroying the Greek civilization&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, XI.1&lt;/ref&gt; is rejected by modern scholars.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Ancient History'' Vol. IV p773-774&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars also agree that the battle led to the  crippling of Carthage's power in Sicily for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, G.P., ''Hannibal'', p15-17 {{ISBN|0-8154-1005-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Ancient History'' Vol. IV p775&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the most important battles of the [[Sicilian Wars]].

==Background==
The [[Phoenicia]]ns had planted trading posts all over the coast of Sicily after 900 BC, but had never penetrated far inland. They had traded with the [[Elymian]], [[Sicani]] and [[Siculi]] communities and ultimately withdrew without resistance to [[Motya]], [[Palermo|Panormus]] and [[Soluntum|Solus]] when the Greek colonists arrived after 750 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides VI.2.6&lt;/ref&gt; These cities remained independent until becoming part of the Carthaginian hegemony after 540 BC, probably when Malchus of Carthage "conquered all Sicily" and sent the captured booty to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] .&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Edward A., ''History of Sicily'', Volume 1, p283-297 – public domain book&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carthaginian hegemony and Greeks in Sicily===
Carthage created her hegemony in part to resist Greek encroachments in the Phoenician sphere of influence. Phoenicians initially (750–650 BC) did not resist the Greeks, but after the Greeks had reached Iberia sometime after 650 BC, Carthage emerged as the leader of Phoenician resistance. During the 6th century BC, mostly under the leadership of the Magonid dynasty, Carthage established a commercially dominant position in the Western Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Markoe, Glenn E., ''Phoenicians'', p54-55 {{ISBN|0-520-22614-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phoenicians in Sicily and the Elymians had teamed up to defeat the Greeks of Selinus and Rhodes near [[Lilybaeum]] in 580 BC, the first recorded clash between Phoenicians and Greeks incident in Sicily. The next known Greek incursion in Sicily took place 70 years later.

The Greeks living in Sicily behaved pretty much like the mainland Greeks, expanding their political and commercial domain at the expense of their neighbors while keeping the Ionian/Dorian feud alive – the Doric colonies were comparably more aggressive in expanding their territory. Trade also flourished between the natives, the Greeks and the Phoenicians and the Sicilian Greeks colonies became prosperous. This prosperity enabled some of the Greek cities to start to expand their territories again, ultimately leading to the events known as the "First Sicilian War".

====Carthage joins the fight====
Carthage and Elymians joined hands in 510 BC to oppose the expedition of Prince [[Dorieus]], who had lost the Spartan throne and was seeking to found a colony, showed up to colonize [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]] – after being expelled from Libya by Carthage in 511 BC. Dorieus was defeated and killed; the Greek survivors then founded [[Heraclea Minoa]].&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus IV.23&lt;/ref&gt; Sicilian Greeks (probably the cities of Akragas, Gela and Selinus) fought an undated war of revenge against Carthage, which led to the destruction of Minoa and a treaty which brought economic benefits for the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Edward A, ''History of Sicily'', Volume 2, p97-100&lt;/ref&gt; An appeal for aid to avenge the death of Dorieus was ignored by mainland Greece, even by Leonidas of Sparta, brother of Dorieus and who later would win immortal fame at [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] in 480 BC. This possibly demonstrated the futility of opposing Carthage by single Greek cities&lt;ref&gt;Baker, G.P., ''Hannibal'', p15&lt;/ref&gt; or the unreliability of aid from mainland Greece, a situation that would change with the rise of the Greek tyrants in Sicily.

===Greek tyrants===
While Carthage remained engaged in Sardinia after 510 BC, most of the Greek colonies in Sicily fell under the rule of tyrants. The tyrants of [[Gela]], [[Akragas]] and [[Rhegion]] successfully expanded their dominion at the expense of native Sicilians and other Greek cities during 505–480 BC, with the Dorian city of Gela being the most successful.

====Dorian Greeks dominate Sicily====
[[Cleander of Gela|Cleander]] (505–498 BC) and his brother [[Hippocrates of Gela|Hippocrates]] (498–491) of Gela successfully took over both Ionian and Dorian Greek territory, and by 490 BC, [[Zankle]], [[Leontini]], [[Catana]], [[Naxos (Sicily)|Naxos]], besides neighboring Sicel lands and [[Camarina]] had fallen to Gela. [[Gelo]], successor of Hippocrates, captured [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] and made the city his capital. By using ethnic cleansing, deportation and enslavement,&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Edward A, ''History of Sicily'', Volume 2, p130-31 – public domain book&lt;/ref&gt; Gelo transformed the former Ionian cities into Dorian ones and made Syracuse the dominant power in Sicily. Meanwhile, Akragas, another Doric city, had taken over neighboring Sikan and Sicel lands under the tyrant [[Theron of Acragas|Theron]] (488–472 BC). To forestall any conflicts between Akragas and Syracuse, Gelo and Theron married into each other's families, thus creating a united front against the Sicels and Ionian Greeks of Sicily.

====Ionian Greeks call on Carthage====
To counter this Doric threat, [[Anaxilas]] of Rhegion from Italy, who had captured Zankle from Gela in 490 BC, allied himself with [[Terillus|Terillus of Himera]], and married the daughter of Terillus.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, VII.163&lt;/ref&gt; Himera and Rhegion next became allies of Carthage, the tyrants even built up personal relationships with the Magonid dynasty of Carthage. Selinus, a Doric city whose territory bordered Theron's domain, also became a Carthaginian ally – perhaps the fear of Theron and the destruction of [[Megara Hyblaea]] (mother city of, Selinus), by Gelo, had played a part in this decision. Thus, 3 power blocks were delicately balanced in Sicily by 483 BC – Ionians dominating the north, Carthage the west, Dorians the east and south. The Sicels and Sikans in the interior remained passive, and if not directly under Greek rule, did not hinder the movements of their forces. The Elmyians joined the Carthaginian alliance.

==Prelude==
The city of Himera had once requested [[Phalaris]], tyrant of Akragas (570–554 BC), to rule Himera.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'', II.20&lt;/ref&gt; Theron emulated Phalaris when he deposed Terillus and added Himera to his domain in 483 BC. Terillus had come to power in Himera after expelling the ruling oligarchs (who had taken refuge in Akragas), and he probably lacked popular support, which may have been exploited by Theron.&lt;ref name="Herodotus, 7.165"&gt;"pulled away from [[Himera]], [[Terillos]], son of [[Crinippos]], being tyran of Himera, lead in the country in this time army of [[Phoenicians]] (''Φοινίκων''), [[Libyans]] (''Λιβύων''), [[Iberians]] (''Ἰβήρων''), [[Ligures]] (''Λιγύων'', Ligyans), [[Elisyces]] (''Ἐλισύκων''), [[Nuragic civilization|Sardones]] (''Σαρδονίων'' &gt; Sardes) and [[Corsi people|Kirnis]] (''Κυρνίων'' &gt; Corsicans) - thirty myriads of men - with their general [[Amilcas]], son of Annon, then king of the [[Carchedonians]], (''Καρχηδονίων'' &gt; [[Carthaginians]] )". Herodotus, 7.165&lt;/ref&gt; Terillus requested Hamilcar, [[Suffet]] of Carthage, and Xenia (guest friend) of Terillus, for aid. Anaxilas also lobbied on his behalf, and sent his own children as hostages to Carthage as a token of loyalty. After a 3-year delay, Hamilcar led a Carthaginian expedition to Sicily in 480 BC, which coincided with the expedition of [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] against mainland Greece.

===Gelo refuses Greece aid===
The mainland Greeks had sent an embassy to Gelon requesting aid against Xerxes. Gelon at first complained that the Greeks spurned his request of aid against the Carthaginians in the past, but he offered to send 24,000 foot, 4000 horse and 200 warships in addition to fully provisioning the combined Greek force in Greece if he was made the supreme commander.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, 7.158&lt;/ref&gt; The Spartans objected to this, and Gelon then asked to be the commander of either the land or naval forces in exchange for his help. The Athenian envoy then objected, and the Greeks were sent packing empty handed. Gelon also hedged his bets, he sent 3 ships under Cadmus of Kos to Delphi, with instructions to offer his submission to Xerxes in case of a Persian victory.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, 7.163&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carthaginian expedition===
Hamilcar is said to have assembled an army numbering 300,000 soldiers from Iberia, Sardinia, Corsica, Italy, Gaul and Africa&lt;ref name="Herodotus, 7.165"/&gt; under the command of a body of Carthaginian officers, along with war chariots, 200 warships and 3,000 transports for the venture.&lt;ref name="Diodorus Siculus XI.20"&gt;Diodorus Siculus XI.20&lt;/ref&gt; According to the modern historians, the numbers are clearly inflated; the Punic army may not have been significantly larger than that of the Greek coalition.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Ancient History'' Vol. IV p773&lt;/ref&gt; The army had no siege engines and the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] and the Elymians, allies in past struggles against Greeks, were not part of it.

====The Carthaginian army====
The core units of the army came from Africa. The heavy African infantry fought in close formation, armed with long spears and round shields, wearing helmets and linen cuirasses. The light Libyan infantry carried javelins and a small shield, same as Iberian light infantry. The Iberian infantry wore purple bordered white tunics and leather headgear. The heavy infantry fought in a dense phalanx, armed with heavy throwing spears, long body shields and short thrusting swords.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, Adrian, ''The fall of Carthage'', p 32 {{ISBN|0-253-33546-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sardinian and Gallic infantry fought in their native gear,&lt;ref&gt;Makroe, Glenn E., ''Phoenicians'', p 84-86 {{ISBN|0-520-22614-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but often were equipped by Carthage.

The Libyans, Carthaginian citizens and the Libyo-Phoenicians provided disciplined, well trained cavalry equipped with thrusting spears and round shields. Iberians and Gauls also provided cavalry, which relied on the all out charge. Libyans also provided bulk of the heavy, four horse war chariots for Carthage.&lt;ref&gt;Warry, John. ''Warfare in the Classical World''. pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sicilian Greek army===
Gelo and Theron had a well trained, battle tested army at their disposal. In addition to citizens, hired mercenaries from Greeks and Sicels augmented their forces. Gelon took out a loan from citizens to fund his war efforts, which indicates the seriousness of the situation. The Syracusan army at Himera is said to have numbered 50,000 foot and 5,000 horse – perhaps another exaggeration.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Edward A., ''History of Sicily'', Vol. 2, p190 – public domain book&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the army of Theron is not known. The main [[hoplite]] force came from the citizens of the Sicilian Greek cities. They were augmented by mercenary hoplites hired from Sicily and Italy, and even mainland Greece. Some of the citizens also served as [[peltast]]s while the wealthier citizens formed the cavalry units. Sicels and Sikan soldiers also served in the force. Mercenaries provided archers, slingers and cavalry.

==The Himera campaign==
Hamilcar chose not to sail to Selinus and then attack Akragas, although it was the coast closest to Carthage. The Carthaginian fleet, escorted by 60 [[triremes]], sailed to Panormus instead. Hamilcar chose this course probably because restoring Terrilus was his primary objective. The conquest of Sicily, if that indeed was a consideration, took second place to his duty as a guest friend of Terrilus. The fleet was battered by storms at sea, losing the ships carrying the chariots and horses&lt;ref name="Diodorus Siculus, XI.20"&gt;Diodorus Siculus, XI.20&lt;/ref&gt; – which would be a significant factor in the coming battle. The Greek fleet, able to muster 200 ships, did not contest the crossing, and in fact played no part in the coming battle.

===The Carthaginian camps at Himera===
Hamilcar spent three days reorganizing his forces at Panormus, and repairing his battered fleet. The Carthaginians marched along the coast to Himera, with the fleet sailing alongside, and encamped near the city. Theron was already present in Himera&lt;ref name="Diodorus Siculus, XI.20" /&gt; with his army, but the Greeks did not interfere with Carthaginian operations. The Greek allies of Hamilcar (Greeks of Selinus and Anaxilas of Rhegion) were absent – and never joined the battle.

The city of Himera sits on top of a hill (300–400 feet high) on the western bank of the River Himera. The hill is steep in the northern, western and eastern sides but gradually slopes to the south. There are hills to the west and south of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Edward A., ''History of Sicily'', Volume 1, p. 414-416 – public domain book&lt;/ref&gt; The Carthaginians erected two camps near Himera. The sea camp was set to the north of Himera by the sea, surrounded by a palisade and a ditch. The army was billeted in a separate camp to the south on a low hill west of Himera. The land and sea camps were joined by siege works.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Edward A., ''History of Sicily'', Volume 2, p. 186-189 – public domain book&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theron's defeat and Gelo's arrival===
It is not known if Hamilcar wished to build siege weapons at Himera or settle the issue through battle. After the camps were erected, the Punic ships dropped off provisions at the sea camp and were sent to Sardinia and Africa for more supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, XI.26&lt;/ref&gt; 20 triremes patrolled the sea, the rest of the ships were beached in the sea camp.&lt;ref name="Diodorus Siculus, XI.24"&gt;Diodorus Siculus, XI.24&lt;/ref&gt; Himera was not fully invested – the east and south sides were open.

Hamilcar led a picked body of men on reconnaissance mission, and defeated the Greeks in a pitched battle outside Himera. The Greeks blocked the west gates of Himera and their morale also fell, while the Carthaginian foragers ranged the territory of Himera. Theron sent messages to Gelo, who arrived with his army and encamped across the river. Gelon's cavalry managed to capture many of the foragers, as Hamilcar had no cavalry present to counter his moves. The morale in Himera improved, and the bricked up gates were cleared on Gelo's orders.

==The battle==
[[Herodotus]] and [[Diodorus Siculus]] give different versions of the battle, which are hard to reconcile. Diodorus provides a more detailed account.

===Herodotus on Himera===
The Greek and Punic armies fought from dawn to dusk, while Hamilcar watched the battle from his camp and offered sacrifices to Baal in a huge fire. No information on numbers, battle formation or battle site is given. When the Carthaginian army was routed towards dusk, Hamilcar jumped into the sacrificial fire. His body was never found&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, 7.165-7&lt;/ref&gt; and the Greeks erected a monument to his memory where he supposedly died. Herodotus noted that Sicilian tradition held that this battle and the battle of Salamis were fought on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Sian, ''Ancient Tyranny'', p123-125, {{ISBN|0-7486-2125-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Himera480.PNG|350px|right|thumb|First Battle of Himera 480 BC. A generic representation, not to exact scale, geographic features partially shown and path of troop movements and dispositions are indicative because of lack of primary source data.]]

===Diodorus Siculus and other sources===
The actions of the Greek cavalry in countering Carthaginian foragers prompted Hamilcar to send a letter to Selinus requesting them to send their cavalry to Himera on a given date that Hamilcar was to offer a sacrifice to Poseidon&lt;ref name="Diodorus Siculus, XI.21"&gt;Diodorus Siculus, XI.21&lt;/ref&gt; – a Greek deity whose worship probably required the presence of Greeks. The letter was intercepted by Gelo's men. Gelo planned to use his own cavalry to impersonate the Selinute reinforcement and infiltrate the Carthaginian camp, while his army attacked the land camp.

====Greeks attack the land camp====
Gelo's horsemen left their camp on the night before the appointed day, and at daybreak these horsemen arrived at the Carthaginian sea camp and were admitted into the camp. Greeks spotted them inside the Carthaginian camp from Himera and signaled Gelo. It is not known if the Syracusan army was inside Gelo's camp or had assembled somewhere outside at that time. The Greeks marched around the south end of Himera and moved towards the Carthaginian land camp. Theron and his army stayed put in Himera. The Carthaginian army left their camp and formed up on the hill, forcing the Greeks to fight an uphill battle. The struggle was fierce and long and neither side gained any advantages.

====Death of Hamilcar====
Sometime after the battle was joined, the disguised Greek horsemen killed Hamilcar while he was preparing the sacrifice, and then set fire to the beached ships, causing great confusion at the sea camp.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, XI.22&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known what further role the Greek cavalry played in the battle. The Carthaginians rushed to launch whatever ships they could save and some of the ships, overcrowded with soldiers, left the site altogether. When the news of Hamilcar's death and the burning of ships reach the fighting armies, the Greeks pressed harder and routed the Carthaginians, who fled to their camp.

In an alternative version, Gelo ordered Pediarchos, his captain of archers, to "dress as the tyrant" to impersonate him and offer sacrifices in front of the camp. Pediarchos was surrounded by archers who had concealed bows in their dress while he impersonated Gelo. Hamilcar was obliged to come out to offer sacrifices also, and the bowmen shot him down.&lt;ref&gt;Polyainos I.27&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theron takes action====
Gelo's army stormed the Carthaginian camp and the Greeks scattered to loot the tents. The Iberians of the Carthaginian army reformed, and they attacked the now disordered Greeks, inflicting severe casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Polyainos I.28&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks fought back, but they were hard pressed and the Iberians got the upper hand in the struggle. At this critical juncture Theron decided to join the battle. He directed his attack on the flank and rear of the Iberian position inside the camp and also set fire to tents near them. The Iberians finally gave way, and retreated to the ships still afloat.&lt;ref name="Diodorus Siculus, XI.24" /&gt; Other Carthaginian survivors left the camp and retreated to a hill inland, where they attempted to defend themselves. The hill was waterless and they were ultimately forced to surrender.&lt;ref name="Diodorus Siculus, XI.21" /&gt; About half of the Carthaginian army and majority of the fleet was destroyed, numerous prisoners and rich booty had fallen into Greek hands. It is commented that the surviving Carthaginian ships were sunk in a storm on their return journey to Africa.&lt;ref name="Diodorus Siculus, XI.21" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
Gelo and Theron did not attack Rhegion or the Carthaginian territory in Sicily after the battle. Carthage initially manned the city walls and prepared for a Greek invasion of Africa, and did not renew the struggle either. Gelo offered mild terms to the Carthaginian embassy that arrived asking for a ceasefire. Carthage paid 2,000 silver talents as indemnity, erected two monuments in the memory of Himera, but lost no territory. Selinus and Rhegion also came to terms with Syracuse and Anaxilas married his daughter to Hieron I, brother of Gelo. The status quo before the battle was reestablished - Terrilus being the ultimate loser. Greek culture and trade flourished in Sicily. Gelo, Theron and Hieron built public buildings using the slaves and spoils gained from the battle, such as the [[Temple of Victory (Himera)|Temple of Victory]]. An era of prosperity began, but infighting among the tyrants ensured that the peace was not unbroken. Carthage focused on expanding in Africa, leaving Sicily alone for 70 years. Apart from an obscure clash in 454 BC, the Greeks and Phoenicians left each other alone in Sicily.

Himera remained in possession of Akragas until 472 BC. Theron expelled the Ionians after they attempted a coup and settled the city with Dorian Greeks. By 466 BC, the Sicilian Greek cities had broken away from the dominions of Gelo and Theron and had overthrown the tyrants' heirs, so in place of three Greek power blocks dominating Sicily (those of Syracuse, Akragas and Rhegion), eleven bickering Greek commonwealths came into being by 461 BC. They continued the Ionic/Doric feud in full force in addition to threatening the native Sicilians. Their actions ultimately led to the "Second Sicilian War" and the final destruction of Himera in 409 BC.

During the construction of a railway extension in 2008, near the site of the ancient Greek colony of Himera, archeologists uncovered more than 10,000 graves. A number of those graves held the remains of 5th century BC soldiers.&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com"&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/12/081217-himera-mass-grave.html National Geographic News, Ancient Mass Graves of Soldiers, Babies Found in Italy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Spanish newspaper [[El País]], on 30.

'''Blow Up''' is a club night that was founded in the early 1990s by promoter and DJ Paul Tunkin at a [[North London]] pub called "The Laurel Tree".  The night quickly became the centre of the emerging [[Britpop]] scene in [[Camden Town|Camden]] attracting long queues of people eager to gain entry to the tiny venue.  Early regulars included members of [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], [[Elastica]], [[Suede (band)|Suede]], [[The Buzzcocks]], [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]] and [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], leading to the club being referred to as the place where "[[Britpop]] was born".&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, R. (6 January 1999). Pub where [[Britpop]] born closes down. ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'', p. 43. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of Blow Up and its audience has been noted as an early influence on, and instrumental in, the later mid-Nineties explosion of the [[Britpop]] scene in the UK and abroad:

{{cquote|By the time [[Blur (band)|Blur]] played [[Alexandra Palace]] about a year after Blow Up started, the whole audience looked like they went there.&lt;ref&gt;Blow Up were also the resident DJs on [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s ''[[Parklife]]'' tour, and Tunkin had previously DJed on the London date of their ''[[Modern Life Is Rubbish]]'' tour in 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] and Blow Up are very interrelated – not only do British bands look like [[Jarvis Cocker|Jarvis]] now, so do fashion models. It's global and I think it started at Blow Up.&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon, A. (1997). ''Those Tourists Are Money: The Rock N Roll Guide To Camden''.

==History==
Often mistakenly labelled as purely a '[[Mod (subculture)|mod]] club' by the press, Blow Up had a much wider musical scope than this, although the club was initially started by Tunkin as a reaction to the prevalent grunge/slacker scene&lt;ref&gt;Corrigan, Susan (1994, October). Blurred Brothers. ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'', pp.24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; which he said "was so anti-style".&lt;ref&gt;Heath, Ashley (1995, January 20). World Comes Around. ''[[The Guardian]]'' , p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The music played included British [[Pop music|Pop]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R'n'B]] from the 1960s ([[Small Faces]], [[The Kinks|Kinks]], [[Rolling Stones]] etc.) and [[Soul music|Soul]], late 1970s [[New wave music|new wave]] ([[Buzzcocks]], [[Wire (band)|Wire]] etc.) together with emerging new bands mixed in with film soundtracks, 'music library'&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Production Music]]&lt;/ref&gt; tracks, [[Easy listening|Easy Listening]] and 1960s [[electronic music]] ([[Jean Jacques Perrey|Jean Jacques Perry]] et al.); anything that fell under Tunkin's term of 'Orgasmic Pop'.

===1993–1996: The Laurel Tree===
When the club first opened in October 1993 its audience was attracted by word of mouth, predominantly made up of [[Camden Town|Camden]] locals, as well as a large proportion of people from Tunkin's hometown of [[Southend]].&lt;ref&gt;"All these famous bands turning up at what was basically a Southend club, but it just happened to be in Camden Town" Scanlon, A. (1997). ''Those Tourists Are Money: The Rock N Roll Guide To Camden''. London: Tristia. p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; However almost a year after opening in 1994, an early defining point for Blow Up was the publication of a 4-page article in music magazine [[Select Magazine|Select]] devoted entirely to the club,&lt;ref&gt;Pattenden, Sian (1994, September). Parkalife. ''[[Select Magazine|Select]]'', pp. 72–75.&lt;/ref&gt; which attracted people from much further afield fuelling its popularity even further.&lt;ref&gt;"So absurdly popular these days, to be sure getting in, you have to start queuing the week before" Parkes, Taylor. (17 June 1995). It is an NW1-derful Life. ''[[Melody Maker]]'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Blow Up's format and the sharp style of its 'regulars' was in contrast to the ubiquitous indie/rock clubs of the time and it went on to influence many similar nights; referred to by [[Melody Maker]] at the height of [[Britpop]] in 1995 as "The Club That Changed The World".&lt;ref&gt;Sarra Manning (1995, March 18). That Was The Weekenders That Was. ''[[Melody Maker]]'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  A year later Blow Up was featured in [[Vox (magazine)|''Vox'' magazine]] as one of "5 clubs that changed the face of clubbing,"&lt;ref&gt;(1996, October). Clubwatch UK: Five Classic Clubs Of Our Time. ''[[Vox (magazine)|Vox]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; alongside seminal UK punk clubs [[Blitz Kids|The Blitz]] and [[The Roxy (Covent Garden)|The Roxy]].

===1996–2001: The Wag Club===
In 1996 the club relocated to [[Soho]] into the much larger venue of The Wag Club, and did much to revive the latter's fortunes which had somewhat waned since its '80s heyday.&lt;ref&gt;(1997, March 8). ''The [[The guardian|Guardian]] Guide (South)'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Blow Up had played host to the occasional live band in [[Camden Town|Camden]], the larger capacity of the Wag enabled live shows to be hosted on a weekly basis, which continued to reflect the clubs broad musical outlook. Bands that played ranged from stalwarts of the 1960s music scene such as [[Desmond Dekker]], to avant-garde acts such as [[Chicks on Speed|Chicks On Speed]] and [[Stereo Total]], and also included a very early show for [[The Libertines]] in 1999. In 1999 the club was voted No. 4 in [[Time Out (company)|Time Out Magazine]]'s 'Top Ten clubs of the 90s'.&lt;ref&gt;(1999, December 22). Readers' Top Tens of the '90s: Clubs. ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' , p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; When The Wag finally closed in 2001 after 40 years,&lt;ref&gt;Previous to the 1980s, The Wag was known as 'The Whisky-A-Go-Go'&lt;/ref&gt; the last club to be held there was Blow Up.

===2001–2009: The Metro Club===
During the last of several short residencies at other [[Soho]] venues in 2001 after The Wag's closure, Blow Up took over the running of a venue on London's [[Oxford Street]] called The Metro Club, and shortly after the Blow Up club night was moved here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blowupmetro.com/about.aspx www.blowupmetro.com/about.aspx]. Accessed November 15, 2006. &lt;br /&gt;[http://www.blowupmetro.com/press.aspx www.blowupmetro.com/press.aspx] Accessed November 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this The Metro club was known primarily as a club venue, but Blow Up began promoting live shows here too, and in 2002 the venue earned [[Time Out (company)|Time Out Magazine]]'s 'Live Venue of The Year' award, attributed to the breakthrough acts booked in their first year there; early shows including bands such as [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]], [[Kings of Leon]] and [[The Killers]]. Due to the planned extension of [[Tottenham Court Road tube station|Tottenham Court Road Underground station]], the Metro Club was issued a Compulsory Purchase Order by Transport for London with 28 days notice in December 2008, and was forced to close. It held its last Blow Up night on 17 January 2009, also the last night of the venue itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blowupmetro.com/closure.aspx Metro Club to close in January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009–present: Post The Metro Club===
Blow Up moved to [[Bar Rumba]], [[Soho]] on 24 January 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blowup.co.uk/club/clubmove2009_pr.htm BLOW UP club moves to new Saturday residency at BAR RUMBA]&lt;/ref&gt; after which it moved to 4 [[Denmark Street]] in 2011, followed by several other London residencies and one-off events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blowupclub.com/history Blow Up Club History &gt;&gt; since 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently in residence at The Bussey Building (a warehouse/Arts space in [[Peckham]]), where it held its 20th Anniversary Party in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blowupclub.com/blow-up-is-20 Blow Up is 20!]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009 the club has hosted more events in the United States ([[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]] and [[Sacramento]]) and also returned to [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blowupclub.com/history Blow Up Club History &gt;&gt; since 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Commonwealth v. Twitchell''''', 416 Mass. 114, 617 N.E.2d 609 (1993),&lt;ref name=Opinion&gt;''Commonwealth v. Twitchell'', [https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2040533/commonwealth-v-twitchell/ 416 Mass. 114, 617 N.E.2d 609] (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; was the most prominent of a series of criminal cases, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, in which parents who were members of the [[Church of Christ, Scientist|Christian Science church]] were prosecuted for the deaths of children whose medical conditions had been treated only by Christian Science prayer.

In 1988, [[Massachusetts]] prosecutors charged David and Ginger Twitchell with [[manslaughter]] in the 1986 death of their two-year-old son Robyn. Robyn Twitchell died of a [[peritonitis]] caused by a bowel obstruction that medical professionals declared would have been easily correctable.

The Twitchells' defense contended that the couple were within their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights to treat their son's illness with prayer and that Massachusetts had recognized this right in an exemption to the statute outlawing [[child neglect]].

The Twitchells were convicted of [[involuntary manslaughter]].  They were sentenced to ten years [[probation]] and required to bring their remaining children to regular visits to a [[pediatrician]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D61030F935A3575BC0A966958260] ''New York Times'', 6 August 1990, In Child Deaths, a Test for Christian Science&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,970633-1,00.html] TIME, 16 July 1990, Convicted Of Relying on Prayer&lt;/ref&gt;  The conviction was overturned in 1993 by the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] on a legal technicality.&lt;ref name=Opinion/&gt; Robert Gittens, speaking for the prosecutors' office commented, "the law is now clear: parents cannot sacrifice the lives of their children in the name of religious freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| agency= Associated Press |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-12/news/mn-23106_1_christian-science|title=Court Overturns Conviction of Christian Science Couple  |work=Los Angeles Times |date=1993-08-12 |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Depression-stock-market-crash-1929.jpg|thumb|The stock market crash of 1929 marked the start of the [[Great Depression]], the most widespread in modern history, with effects felt until the start of [[World War II]]]]
In [[economics]], a '''depression''' is a sustained, long-term downturn in economic activity in one or more economies. It is a more severe economic downturn than a [[economic recession|recession]], which is a slowdown in economic activity over the course of a normal [[business cycle]].

A depression is an unusual and extreme form of recession. Depressions are characterized by their length, by abnormally large increases in [[unemployment]], falls in the availability of [[credit (finance)|credit]] (often due to some form of banking or financial crisis), shrinking output as buyers dry up and suppliers cut back on production and investment, large number of [[bankruptcies]] including sovereign debt defaults, significantly reduced amounts of [[trade]] and commerce (especially international trade), as well as highly volatile relative currency value fluctuations (often due to currency [[devaluation]]s). Price [[deflation (economics)|deflation]], [[financial crisis|financial crises]] and [[bank failure]]s are also common elements of a depression that do not normally occur during a recession.

==Definitions==
In the [[United States]] the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] determines contractions and expansions in the business cycle, but does not declare depressions.&lt;ref name="nber.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/recessions_faq.html |title=The NBER's Business Cycle Dating Procedure: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Nber.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008141654/http://www.nber.org/cycles/recessions_faq.html |archivedate=2012-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, periods labeled depressions are marked by a substantial and sustained shortfall of the ability to purchase goods relative to the amount that could be produced using current resources and technology ([[potential output]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/history/A0821657.html |title=Private Tutor |publisher=Infoplease.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913025403/http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/history/A0821657.html |archivedate=2012-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another proposed definition of ''depression'' includes two general rules:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12852043 | work=The Economist | title=Diagnosing depression | date=December 30, 2008 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215002935/http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12852043 | archivedate=February 15, 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://businesscycles.info/recession-definition/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202110823/http://businesscycles.info/recession-definition/ |archivedate=2009-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# a decline in real GDP exceeding 10%, or
# a recession lasting 2 or more years.

There are also differences in the duration of depression across definitions. Some economists refer only to the period when economic activity is declining. The more common use, however, also encompasses the time until economic activity has returned close to normal levels.&lt;ref name="nber.org"/&gt;

A recession is briefly defined as a period of declining economic activity spread across the economy (according to NBER). Under the first definition, each depression will always coincide with a recession, since the difference between a depression and a recession is the severity of the fall in economic activity.  In other words, each depression is always a recession, sharing the same starting and ending dates and having the same duration.

Under the second definition, depressions and recessions will always be distinct events however, having the same starting dates. This definition of depression implies that a recession and a depression will have different ending dates and thus distinct durations. Under this definition, the length of a depression will always be longer than that of the recession starting the same date.

A useful example is the difference in the chronology of the Great Depression in the U.S. under the view of alternative definitions. Using the second definition of depression, most economists refer to the Great Depression, as the period between 1929 and 1941. On the other hand, using the first definition, the depression that started in August 1929 lasted until March 1933. Note that NBER, which publishes the recession (instead of depression) dates for the U.S. economy, has identified two recessions during that period. The first between August 1929 and March 1933 and the second starting in May 1937 and ending in June 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219215409/https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |archivedate=2009-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Today the term "depression" is most often associated with the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, but the term had been in use long before then. Indeed, an early major American economic crisis, the [[Panic of 1819]], was described by then-president [[James Monroe]] as "a depression",&lt;ref name="hnn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/articles/61931.html|title=When Did the Great Depression Receive Its Name?  (And Who Named It?)|author=|date=|website=hnn.us|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901125648/http://hnn.us/articles/61931.html|archivedate=1 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the economic crisis immediately preceding the 1930s depression, the [[Depression of 1920–21]], was referred to as a "depression" by president [[Calvin Coolidge]].

However, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, ''financial'' crises were traditionally referred to as "panics", e.g., the 'major' [[Panic of 1907]], and the 'minor' [[Panic of 1910–1911]], though the 1929 crisis was more commonly called "The Crash", and the term "panic" has since fallen out of use. At the time of the Great Depression (of the 1930s), the phrase "The Great Depression" had already been used to refer to the period 1873–96 (in the United Kingdom), or more narrowly 1873–79 (in the United States), which has since been renamed the [[Long Depression]].

Common use of the phrase "The Great Depression" for the 1930s crisis is most frequently attributed to British economist [[Lionel Robbins]], whose 1934 book ''The Great Depression'' is credited with 'formalizing' the phrase,&lt;ref name="hnn"/&gt; though US president [[Herbert Hoover]] is widely credited with having 'popularized' the term/phrase,&lt;ref name="hnn" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Glory and the Dream: A Narrative History of America, 1932–1972'', William Manchester&lt;/ref&gt; informally referring to the downturn as a "depression", with such uses as "Economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement", (December 1930, Message to Congress) and "I need not recount to you that the world is passing through a great depression" (1931).

==Occurrence==
Due to the lack of an agreed definition and the strong negative associations, the characterization of any period as a "depression" is contentious. The term was frequently used for regional crises from the early 19th century until the 1930s, and for the more widespread crises of the 1870s and 1930s, but economic crises since 1945 have generally been referred to as "recessions", with the 1970s global crisis referred to as "[[stagflation]]", but not a depression. The only two eras commonly referred to at the current time as "depressions" are the 1870s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="krug2010"&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/opinion/28krugman.html | first = Paul | last = Krugman | authorlink = Paul Krugman | title = The Third Depression | date = June 27, 2010 | journal = [[The New York Times]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120411051630/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/opinion/28krugman.html | archivedate = April 11, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To some degree this is simply a stylistic change, similar to the decline in the use of "panic" to refer to financial crises, but it does also reflect that the [[economic cycle]] – both in the United States and in most [[OECD]] countries – though not in all – has been more moderate since 1945.

There ''have'' been many periods of prolonged economic underperformance in particular countries/regions since 1945, detailed below, but terming these as "depressions" is controversial. The current economic cycle, which has comprised the most significant global crisis since the Great Depression, has at times been termed a depression,&lt;ref name="krug2010" /&gt; but this terminology is not widely used, with the episode instead being referred to by other terms, such as the "[[Great Recession]]".

== Notable depressions ==

===Panic of 1837===
{{main|Panic of 1837}}
The Panic of 1837 was an American [[financial crisis]], built on a [[Speculation|speculative]] real estate market.&lt;ref name="politonomist.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politonomist.com/history-of-economic-recessions-00273/3/|title=Panic of 1837 (1837 - 1842) — History of Economic Recessions|date=2009-01-02|publisher=Politonomist.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406205415/http://www.politonomist.com/history-of-economic-recessions-00273/3/|archivedate=2009-04-06|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2012-09-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bubble burst on May 10, 1837 in [[New York City]], when every [[bank]] stopped payment in [[gold]] and [[silver]] [[coin]]age. The Panic was followed by a five-year depression,&lt;ref name="politonomist.com" /&gt; with the failure of [[bank]]s and record high unemployment levels.&lt;ref name="Glasner"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business cycles and depressions: an encyclopedia|author=Timberlake, Jr., Richard H.|publisher=Garland Publishing|year=1997|isbn=0-8240-0944-4|editor1=Glasner, David|location=New York|pages=514–16|chapter=Panic of 1837|editor2=Cooley, Thomas F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Long Depression ===
[[File:Tompkins square riot 1874.jpg|thumb|New York police violently attacking unemployed workers in [[Tompkins Square Riot (1874)|Tompkins Square Park]], 1874]]
{{details|Long Depression}}
Starting with the adoption of the [[gold standard]] in Britain and the United States, the [[Long Depression]] (1873–1896) was indeed longer than what is now referred to as the Great Depression, but shallower. However, it was known as "the Great Depression" until the 1930s.{{CN|date=November 2018}}

===Great Depression===
{{main|Great Depression}}
The best-known depression was the [[Great Depression]], which affected most national economies in the world throughout the 1930s.  This depression is generally considered to have begun with the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], and the crisis quickly spread to other national economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/depression/about.htm |title=About the Great Depression |publisher=English.uiuc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220090243/http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/depression/about.htm |archivedate=2008-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1929 and 1933, the [[gross national product]] of the [[United States]] decreased by 33% while the rate of [[unemployment]] increased to 25% (with industrial unemployment alone rising to approximately 35% – U.S. employment was still over 25% agricultural).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}  

A long-term effect of the Great Depression was the departure of every major currency from the [[gold standard]], although the initial impetus for this was World War II (see [[Bretton Woods Accord]]). In any case, the world economy has simply outgrown the capacity of additions to the world gold supply to accommodate the increase in world population and increased trade without periodic, painful revaluations of any currencies tied to gold.

===Greek Depression===
{{main|European sovereign-debt crisis}}
Beginning in 2009, Greece sank into a recession that, after two years, [[Greek government-debt crisis|became a depression]]. The country saw an almost 20% drop in economic output, and unemployment soared to near 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/14/greece-gdp-idUSL5E8ME4WM20121114 |title=Greece sinks deeper into depression in third quarter |publisher=Reuters |date= |accessdate=2012-11-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114221922/http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/14/greece-gdp-idUSL5E8ME4WM20121114 |archivedate=2012-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greece's high amounts of sovereign debt precipitated the crisis, and the poor performance of its economy since the introduction of severe [[austerity]] measures has slowed the entire eurozone's recovery. Greece's continuing troubles have led to discussions about [[Greek withdrawal from the eurozone|its departure from the eurozone]].

==Other depressions==
===Global===
The late 1910s and early 1920s were marked by an economic depression that unraveled in particularly catastrophic circumstances: The [[Great War]] and its aftermath led to a global nosedive in commodities that ruined many developing nations, while servicemen returning from the trenches found themselves with high unemployment as businesses failed, unable to transition into a peacetime economy. Also, the [[Spanish flu pandemic]] of 1918-20 brought economic activity to a standstill as even more people became incapacitated. Most developed countries had mostly recovered by 1921-22, however [[Germany]] saw its economy crippled until 1923-24 because of the hyperinflation crisis.

The [[1973 oil crisis]], coupled with the rising costs of maintenance of [[welfare state]] in most countries led to a [[1973-75 recession|recession between 1973 and 1975]], followed by a period of [[stagflation|almost minimal growth and rising inflation and unemployment]]. The [[Early 1980s recession|1980-82 recession]] marked the end of the period.

The [[Savings and loan crisis|savings &amp; loans]] and the [[leveraged buyout]] crises led to a severe depression in mid-to-late 1989, causing a [[Early 1990s recession|recession in 1990-91]] (also fueled by [[1990 oil price shock|the oil price crisis]]), whose effects lasted as late as 1994. This downturn is more remembered for its political effects: [[British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] had to resign in November 1990 as a result of the socioeconomic debacle caused by her later policies; and while his approval ratings were above 60%, [[U.S. President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] lost the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 election]] to [[Bill Clinton]] because of the domestic malady marked by the depression and increasing urban decay.

In 2005, the [[2000s energy crisis|persistent oil price rises]] and [[economic overheating]] caused by deregulation led to a gradual deterioration of the world economy with inflation and unemployment rising as growth slowed down: The [[housing bubble]] in the U.S. burst in 2007, and the American economy slipped into a [[Great Recession|recession]]. This in turn provoked the failure of many prominent financial institutions throughout 2008, most notably [[Lehman Brothers]], leading to the loss of millions of jobs.

===Regional===
Several Latin American countries had severe downturns in the 1980s: by the Kehoe and Prescott definition of a great depression as at least one year with output 20% below trend, [[Economy of Argentina|Argentina]], [[Economic history of Brazil#Stagnation, inflation, and crisis, 1981-94|Brazil]], [[Economy of Chile|Chile]], and [[Economic history of Mexico#1982 crisis and recovery|Mexico]] experienced great depressions in the 1980s, and Argentina experienced [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|another]] in 1998–2002. South American countries fell once again into this in the early-to-mid 2010s as a result of falling prices of commodities such as in the 1980s, with the economies of Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela falling into recession as massive government spending further strained their financial situation.

This definition also includes the economic performance of [[Economy of New Zealand|New Zealand]] from 1974–1992 and [[Economy of Switzerland|Switzerland]] from 1973 to the present, although this designation for Switzerland has been controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Abrahamsen Y, R. |author2=Aeppli, E. |author3=Atukeren, M. |author4=Graff, C. |author5=Müller |author6=Schips, B. |title=The Swiss disease: Facts and artifacts.

J. |author2=Ruhl, K. J. |year=2005|title=Is Switzerland in a Great Depression?|publisher=[[Review of Economic Dynamics]]|volume=8|pages=759–775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic crisis in the 1990s that struck former members of the [[Soviet Union]] was almost twice as intense as the Great Depression in the countries of [[Western Europe]] and the United States in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Can Transition Economies Learn from the First Ten Years?

Finnish economists refer to the [[Early 1990s depression in Finland|Finnish economic decline]] around the breakup of the Soviet Union (1989–1994) as a great depression (''suuri lama''). However, the depression was multicausal, with its severity compounded by a coincidence of multiple sudden external shocks, including loss of Soviet trade, the [[savings and loan crisis]] and [[early 1990s recession]] in the West, with the internal overheating that had been brewing throughout the 1980s. Liberalization had resulted in the so-called "casino economy". Persistent structural and monetary policy problems had not been solved, leaving the economy vulnerable to even mild external shocks. The depression had lasting effects: the Finnish markka was floated and was eventually replaced by the euro in 1999, ending decades of government control of the economy, but also high, persistent unemployment. Employment has never returned even close to pre-crisis level.

[[File:Nairobi-Ivory-Burn-by-Mwangi-Kirubi-10.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A stack of elephant tusks burning in Kenya in April 2016]]

The '''destruction of ivory''' is a technique used by governments and [[conservation movement|conservation groups]] to deter the [[Poaching#In Sub-Saharan Africa|poaching of elephants]] for their [[tusk]]s and to suppress the illegal [[ivory trade]]. {{as of|2016}}, more than {{convert|263|t|lb|sigfig=3}} of [[ivory]] has been destroyed, typically by burning or crushing, in these high-profile events in 21 countries around the world. Kenya held the first event in 1989, as well as the largest event in 2016, when a total of 105 tonnes of ivory were incinerated.

The conservationists, governments, and [[non-governmental organization]]s that endorse the strategy argue that it fosters public support for the protection of elephants and that it sends a message to poachers their work is futile. Critics contend that the technique may increase poaching by creating a perception of [[scarcity]] that increases ivory's value on the [[black market]], and that evidence for the technique's effectiveness is insufficient to justify the [[opportunity cost]] for countries struggling with poverty.

== Background ==
{{Main article|Ivory trade}}
Archaeological findings show human use of [[ivory]] to date back more than 35,000 years.&lt;ref name=chaiklin/&gt; It has been exported to Europe since at least [[Classical antiquity]], but exporting accelerated during the [[Age of Discovery|Age of Exploration]] and [[colonisation of Africa]].&lt;ref name=chaiklin/&gt; At its peak, at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century, with the rise of [[mass production]], well over 1000 tons of ivory were exported to Europe yearly.&lt;ref name=geographical/&gt; In the last quarter of the 19th century, the city of [[Sheffield]], England alone imported 180 tons just for cutlery handles.&lt;ref name=chaiklin/&gt; In the 1970s, Japan became the largest consumer of ivory, accounting for about 40% of all trade worldwide, with Hong Kong acting as the largest trade hub.&lt;ref name=geographical/&gt;&lt;ref name=tosave/&gt;

Hunting for ivory is responsible for significant reductions in elephant populations in several parts of Africa. Between 1979 and 1989, the African elephant population decreased in size from 1.3&amp;nbsp;million to 600,000. Ivory became a billion-dollar market, with about 80% of the supply taken from illegally killed elephants.&lt;ref name=geographical/&gt;&lt;ref name=tosave/&gt; {{as of|2014}}, according to a report by the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], about 96 African elephants are killed for their [[tusk]]s every day.&lt;ref name=natgeo25january2014 /&gt;

In 1986, [[CITES]] (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) introduced a control system based on permits, registration, stockpiles, and monitoring. Shortly thereafter, the CITES Secretariat weakened regulations, effectively legalizing stockpiles of poached ivory. For example, countries such as Burundi and Singapore, which were not home to wild elephants, registered 89.5 and 297 tons of trafficked ivory, respectively. As uncovered by the [[Environmental Investigation Agency]], the "control system" turned out to be easy to manipulate, ultimately increasing the value of ivory and empowering smugglers.&lt;ref name=tosave/&gt;&lt;ref name=system/&gt; At the October 1989 CITES convention in [[Geneva]], representatives from Tanzania proposed an effective ban on the international ivory trade. After heated debates, the ban was enacted, and went into effect in January 1990.&lt;ref name=tosave/&gt;&lt;ref name=inquirer/&gt;

The ban proved effective for about a decade, and saw rising elephant populations, but starting in 1997 CITES began granting exceptions to the ban to allow countries such as Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Namibia to sell a limited amount of ivory, as well as an exception to Japan to buy a limited amount, based on each country's declared confidence in their effective regulation and control. From 1998 to 2011, other countries were granted exceptions and illegal trafficking at least tripled.&lt;ref name=atlantic27january2014 /&gt; The majority of ivory in the 21st century has gone to growing Asian markets, including and especially China, where the material has been viewed as a [[status symbol]] sometimes known as "white gold".&lt;ref name=atlantic27january2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian11november2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn6january2014 /&gt; In 2015, Chinese officials expressed their intent to phase out the country's involvement with the ivory trade.

In 1989 [[Richard Leakey]], a [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]] and [[Conservation movement|conservationist]] from the prominent [[Leakey family]], was named head of Kenya's Wildlife Conservation and Management Department, the forerunner to today's [[Kenya Wildlife Service]].&lt;ref name=ras/&gt; [[Big five game#African elephant|Elephant hunting]] had been [[Elephant hunting in Kenya#The ban, and ivory smuggling|banned in 1973]], but the [[ivory trade]] remained legal.&lt;ref name=sportsafield/&gt; By the 1980s, [[Poaching#In Sub-Saharan Africa|elephant poaching]] had become widespread due to the increasing price of ivory.&lt;ref name=nytimes12may1989/&gt; In a May 1989 article, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described [[Tsavo West National Park|Tsavo National Park]] as "an elephant graveyard - piles of bleached white elephant bones - instead of an elephant habitat".&lt;ref name=nytimes12may1989/&gt; Kenyan officials knew the value of the elephant to [[safari]] tourism, and wanted to persuade CITES to include the animal on its global [[endangered species]] list at its October 1989 meeting.&lt;ref name=atlantic27january2014 /&gt;

When Leakey took the position, the organization had 12 tons of confiscated illegal ivory in its possession, which he was urged to sell in order to fund conservation efforts. Instead, he piled all of it together and, with Kenyan President [[Daniel arap Moi]], set it on fire.&lt;ref name=nytimes19july1989/&gt; Ivory does not easily burn, but the choice to use fire rather than other means to destroy it was intentional as Leakey wanted the event to produce powerful images for the global media. To make the destruction spectacular, Leakey worked with a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] [[special effect]]s professional to devise an innovative [[pyrotechnics]] technique using [[jet fuel]] and flammable glue.&lt;ref name="gallmann1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc23september2015 /&gt;

It was a successful [[publicity stunt]], attracting international attention from the press while the fire burned for three days.&lt;ref name=radiolab /&gt; It also proved influential among conservationists, encouraging others to dispose of their stockpiles in a similar manner and leading, in part, to the international ban on the ivory trade passed at CITES.&lt;ref name=radiolab /&gt;&lt;ref name=natgeo19june2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=natgeotanzania /&gt; Paul Udoto of the Kenya Wildlife Service called it a "desperate measure meant to send a message to the world about the destruction through poaching of Kenya's elephants."&lt;ref name=bbc23september2015 /&gt;

== Techniques ==
Destroying ivory by any practical means is difficult.&lt;ref name=natgeo2august2013 /&gt; Burning is the most common method of large-scale destruction of ivory. When Kenya burned 12 tons of it in 1989, it created a major media [[spectacle]] and inspired similar actions around the world.&lt;ref name=natgeo19june2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=natgeo2august2013 /&gt; More recently, crushing methods have also been used, as well as combinations of crushing and burning.

=== Burning ===
When Kenyan officials decided to destroy their stockpile in 1989, they had to find a way to do so that would create powerful images. Leakey turned to fellow conservationist [[Kuki Gallmann]], who described their discussions and experiments in her memoir ''[[I Dreamed of Africa]]''. She asked Hollywood special effects professional Robin Hollister what he would recommend, and introduced him to Leakey. Hollister understood Leakey's intention to create a spectacle, and the importance of producing an immediate dramatic flare-up. He suggested a combination of flammable glue to coat the tusks, and a hidden system of pipes to spray them with fuel. His plans were adopted, and when the Kenyan President held a torch to the waiting pile, "Flames flared up in a scalding blaze. […] The ivory blackened and started burning, crackling. Deafening applause burst out from the crowd, while television crews from all over the world showed to every corner of the Earth this new sacrifice of Africa."&lt;ref name="gallmann1991" /&gt;
[[File:Ivory burning site at Nairobi National Park.jpg|thumb|left|Ivory burning site in Kenya's [[Nairobi National Park]]]]

Research performed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] (FWS) in 2008, found burning to be an inefficient and highly challenging way to destroy ivory when compared to crushing.&lt;ref name=natgeo2august2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=fws /&gt; Like [[human tooth|human teeth]], elephant tusks are resistant to burning. Simple burning typically just [[char]]s the outside; it requires extreme conditions over a long period of time to destroy ivory effectively. Using specialized equipment to burn a tusk at {{convert|1800|F|-2}}, its weight decreases by only {{convert|0.25|oz|g|0}} each minute (an average African elephant tusk is about {{convert|50|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and can weigh as much as {{convert|130|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=bbc23september2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=natgeo2august2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica /&gt;&lt;ref name=discover /&gt; For each of Kenya's burns, organizers used jet oil to increase the temperature and it still persists for about a week.&lt;ref name=bbc23september2015 /&gt;

When only the outside is affected, the inner ivory is still commercially viable. As there are not yet verified techniques for identifying ivory that was previously burned, some have expressed concerns regarding the possible use of some of the burned stockpiles.&lt;ref name=natgeo2august2013 /&gt;
[[File:Ivory Crush 2013 (10897641734).jpg|thumb|A rock crusher during the 2013 ivory crush in the United States]]

Hollister, the original "burn architect" who invented the technique in 1989, was asked to lead the 2016 burn, which was many times bigger than the first. He acknowledged that ivory doesn't really burn: "we have to raise the temperature in the fires to such a degree that it actually disintegrates. We're going to create [that] by combining kerosene and diesel and compressed air, pushing it at very high pressure, about 16 bar, down a pipe."&lt;ref name="vice29may2016" /&gt; The question of the effectiveness of the destruction – even the possibility that some of the partially combusted ivory may find its way back to the black market – is a touchy subject. "It's heresy to consider any other form of destruction, leave alone finding any other way to use the ivory or utilise wildlife resources."&lt;ref name="dailynation30april2016" /&gt;

=== Crushing ===
Crushing can also be challenging. In 2013, the Philippines resolved to crush their five-ton stockpile, in part due to environmental objections to a large open fire. They first attempted to use a [[road roller]] on the tusks and then on smaller, sawn-off pieces. When that did not work, the pieces were repeatedly smashed with a backhoe bucket. What was left was taken to a [[crematory]].&lt;ref name=natgeo2august2013 /&gt; When the United States held a similar event a few months later, they opted to use a large rock crusher; a short time later, France employed a pulverizer to turn its illegal ivory into a powder onto which was then poured a composite material to ensure that none of the ivory could be used.&lt;ref name=natgeo16november2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian6february2014 /&gt;

== Justification, objections, and impact ==

=== Messaging ===
[[File:Ivory Crush 2013 (10897712824) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Journalists and other on-lookers at the 2013 ivory crush in the United States]]
Destroying ivory is a tactic endorsed by several governments, activists, and NGOs.

Richard Leakey, who was responsible for the first major ivory destruction in Kenya in 1989, argues that these acts are primarily about sending a message to foster a public that sees the value in wildlife itself, not its [[byproduct]]s, and thereby influencing the demand side of the market. In explaining the "enormous impact" that he saw after the 1989 event, Leakey said that "up to that time we'd been losing about three and a half thousand to four thousand elephants a year, and a year later we were losing at most sixty."&lt;ref name=radiolab /&gt; Consumer research in China, the world's largest consumer of ivory, showed that many potential buyers have little understanding of the connection between the ivory trade and steep declines in elephant populations. High-profile government events bring the problem to large numbers of people and affirm a government stance for anyone who had been unclear.&lt;ref name=cnn6january2014 /&gt; The events also aim to signal decreasing acceptance and popularity of ivory goods, making them less desirable by lowering their status and shaming individuals, organizations, and institutions who buy, sell, or own the goods.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;&lt;!-- came across this multiple times -- npr isn't the ideal source. Will come back shortly to add a better one --&gt; In China, prices fell by nearly half between 2015 and 2016, following the government announcement that it would begin phasing out its domestic ivory trade. According to Hongxiang Huang in a report by ''[[National Public Radio|NPR]]'', the decline was not likely due to conservation reasons, but because "[o]ne thing that proud Chinese people don't want to be, these days, is behind the times."&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;

Advocates also believe that destroying ivory can influence the supply side of the ivory market by sending a strong, highly visible and well-publicized message that the ivory market is dangerous and futile. Similarly, those who would otherwise consider ivory as an investment opportunity may think twice if the market is so consistently disrupted.&lt;ref name=guardian11november2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=natgeo29june2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=natgeo2august2013 /&gt; French [[Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy|Minister of Ecology]] [[Philippe Martin (politician)|Philippe Martin]] called the destruction of ivory "indispensable in the fight against trafficking of threatened species" and said that it sends "a firm message".&lt;ref name=guardian6february2014 /&gt;

In Botswana, which is home to almost half of the elephants in Africa, officials are opposed to destroying ivory stockpiles {{As of|2016|lc=yes}}, and President [[Ian Khama]] publicly boycotted the 2016 Kenyan burn. Botswanan officials believe that burning tusks communicates that the animal does not have value. Instead, confiscated goods like ivory and rhinoceros horns are displayed to symbolize the value of wildlife conservation. An example of this was the 2015 unveiling of an elephant statue, made entirely of ivory tusks, at the country's main [[Sir Seretse Khama International Airport|international airport]] in [[Gaborone]].&lt;ref name="bbc30april2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="africa17july2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="independent25April2016" /&gt; 
[[File:New York Ivory Crush 2015 (19152953071).jpg|thumb|The remains of ivory sent through a rock crusher in New York in 2015]]

=== Economics ===

==== Scarcity ====
Several journalists and conservationists have challenged the logic of the strategy, arguing that destroying the ivory makes it [[scarcity|scarcer]], which should drive up black market prices and lead to an increase in poaching, rather than a decrease.&lt;ref name=radiolab /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian30april2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc30april2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian6february2014a /&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian13november2013 /&gt; Karl Mathiesen disputes this claim from a basic economics perspective, pointing out that it is the seizure of the ivory, not destroying it, which takes it off the market and affects its scarcity, so the price should not be significantly affected based on whether that seized ivory is kept stockpiled in a warehouse or destroyed.&lt;ref name=guardian6february2014a /&gt; Although destroying seized ivory should not affect a perfectly [[rational choice theory|rational]] market, Daniel Stiles suggests that what these events effectively communicate to poachers and illegal traders is the [[perception]] of scarcity, if not actual scarcity, which he argues could also lead to an increase in poaching.&lt;ref name=guardian13november2013/&gt;

An example several commentators point to is a 2014 study funded by [[Save the Elephants]] that found that the price of ivory tripled in China during four years following 2011. It correlated that trend to an increase in poaching as well as an increase in the frequency of high-profile events in which stockpiles were destroyed.&lt;ref name=africa8august2014/&gt; Research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research offer an alternative theory: that the increase in price and demand "likely originated" with CITES's experimental allowance of a legal sale of a large amount of ivory in 2008.&lt;ref name=guardian13june2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=nber/&gt; More recently, however, Save the Elephants reported the cost of ivory in China has fallen by nearly half, following an announcement by the Chinese government that it would phase out its domestic trade.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian8december2015/&gt; In Japan, the demand for ivory has decreased since 2012 as a result of new consumer awareness through education about the connection between buying ivory and the killing of elephants.&lt;ref name="africa8august2014" /&gt;

Ultimately, Mathiesen describes the debate as "characterized by a lack of data", while Tom Milliken concluded in 2014 that the strategy needs to be closely monitored for effectiveness and that more data needs to be collected because {{as of|2014|lc=yes}} there was not sufficient "proof that destroying supply leads to a decline in demand".&lt;ref name=guardian6february2014a/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc29april2016/&gt;

A related concern expressed by Stiles is that perceived scarcity may lead countries still active in the ivory trade to create stockpiles of their own, owing to "the senseless system now in operation" in countries like the United States, Thailand, and China, whereby international ivory trade is considered illegal but domestic trade is permitted, ensuring at least some continued demand and, in Stiles's view, "guaranteeing [[extinction]] of the elephant".&lt;ref name=natgeo16november2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=natgeo12november2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian13november2013 /&gt;

==== Opportunity costs ====
Instead of destroying confiscated ivory, a government could choose to sell it, and put the funds to use in one of several ways. Several of the countries involved in the ivory trade, especially those on the supply side in Africa, are also some of the nations which struggle the most with [[Poverty in Africa|poverty]]. Destroying ivory in those countries is thus often a controversial decision for internal stakeholders as well as external commentators, as the funds gained by selling the material could be used to improve the quality of life for human citizens.&lt;ref name=natgeotanzania /&gt;

Confiscated ivory could also be sold to pay for conservation efforts. Zimbabwe, for example, which has long opposed the ban on the ivory trade, publicly refuses to destroy its 70-ton stockpile. {{as of|2016}} the country is home to 83,000 elephants, but with its current economic situation it cannot afford continuing conservation efforts. According to Environment Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri, "To us, burning is not an option, we need the resources for sustainable wildlife conservation."&lt;ref name=reuters1june2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsweek1june2016/&gt;

Economic research published in 2016 analyzed the efficacy of a one-time legal sale of ivory stockpiles to China and Japan, allowed by CITES in 2008. The idea was to try to flood the market, sinking prices and profitability, but the result was "catastrophic" according to one researcher, who attributes to it a significant, long-term increase in poaching due to factors like a reduction of the social stigma of ivory and providing a mechanism to obscure smuggling activities.&lt;ref name=guardian13june2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=nber/&gt; Christopher Alden, who supported but did not take part in this analysis, specifically criticized requests from countries like Zimbabwe and Namibia to allow limited sales, due to the likelihood of them having a similar counterproductive outcome.&lt;ref name=guardian13june2016/&gt;

=== Corruption and security ===
Although the destruction of ivory is centered upon conservation, there are other considerations which affect institutions' decisions on the matter.

When Hong Kong announced the destruction of its stockpile, it noted "the management burden and the security risk" inherent in the possession of large quantities of valuable material.&lt;ref name=independent23january2014 /&gt; For example, when the Philippines decided to burn its stockpile, only a fraction of what it had confiscated over the years remained, with at least six tons "lost" or stolen during the 2000s alone.&lt;ref name=natgeo19june2013 /&gt; Stockpiles of ivory have often been connected to theft and corruption, with multiple countries, including Zambia, Mozambique, Botswana, and the Philippines, suffering "losses" of several tons. Keeping illicit goods on hand can also signal government plans or active involvement with the ivory trade. Destroying it removes the possibility of corruption as well as the costs associated with operating a secure place of storage.&lt;ref name=natgeo2august2013 /&gt;

For Paula Kahumbu, CEO of Kenya's [[WildlifeDirect]], maintaining stockpiles does too much to enable illegal trade to justify keeping it rather than destroying it. She told ''NPR'' that when an ivory dealer wants to obtain ivory, the most sensible way to do so is not to go hunting, which carries many risks, but to "raid a stockpile by bribing the guy who has the key".&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; She gives examples of tusks being lost from vaults and even courtroom exhibits due to corruption.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;

In the United States, research linking the ivory trade to terrorism and organized crime has tied the destruction of ivory stockpiles to [[national security]], not just conservation.&lt;ref name=guardian12december2012 /&gt;

{{Violence against women}}
'''Dowry deaths''' are deaths of  women who are [[murder]]ed or driven to [[suicide]] by continuous harassment and torture by husbands and in-laws in an effort to extort an increased [[dowry]].

Dowry deaths are found predominantly in India,&lt;ref name=india/&gt; Pakistan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrights.asia/news/ahrc-news/AHRC-ART-003-2014 PAKISTAN: The social injustice behind the practice of dowry-when greed dictates society] Asian Human Rights Commission (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh,&lt;ref name=UNBangladeshDowry/&gt; and Iran.&lt;ref name=iranpbs&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2010/08/selected-headlines-202.html Isfahan man kills daughter over inability to pay dowry] Public Broadcasting Service, Washington DC (August 16, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kiani 2014"&gt;Kiani et al. (2014), A Survey on Spousal Abuse of 500 Victims in Iran, American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology, 35(1):50-54, March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; India reports the highest total number of dowry deaths with 8,391 such deaths reported in 2010, 1.4 deaths per 100,000 women. Adjusted for population, Pakistan, with 2,000 reported such deaths per year, has the highest rate of dowry death at 2.45 per 100,000 women.&lt;ref&gt;Subhani, D., Imtiaz, M., &amp; Afza, S. (2009), To estimate an equation explaining the determinants of Dowry, MePRC Journal, University of Munich, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Siwan (2000), "The economics of dowry payments in Pakistan", ''Mimeo'', Tilburg University Press, Center for Economic Research&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowry death is considered one of the many categories of [[violence against women]], alongside [[rape]], [[bride burning]], [[eve teasing]], and [[acid throwing]].

==India==
{{Further|Dowry system in India}}Most dowry deaths occur when the young woman, unable to bear the harassment and torture, commits suicide. Most of these suicides are by hanging, poisoning or by fire. Sometimes the woman is killed by setting her on fire by her husband or inlaws ; this is known as "[[bride burning]]", and sometimes disguised as suicide or accident. Death by burning of Indian women have been more frequently attributed to dowry conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Virendra|title=Burnt wives|journal=Burns|date=Feb 2003|volume=29|issue=1|pages=31–36|doi=10.1016/s0305-4179(02)00235-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In dowry deaths, the groom's family is the perpetrator of murder or suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Oldenburg, V. T. (2002). Dowry murder: The imperial origins of a cultural crime. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

India has by far the highest number of dowry related deaths in the world according to Indian National Crime Record Bureau. In 2012, 18,233 dowry death cases were reported across India.&lt;ref name=india&gt;{{cite web

===Prohibition===
The ''[[Dowry Prohibition Act]]'' of 1961 prohibits the request, payment or acceptance of a dowry, "as consideration for the marriage", where "dowry" is defined as a gift demanded or given as a precondition for a marriage. Gifts given without a precondition are not considered dowry, and are legal. Asking or giving of dowry can be punished by an imprisonment of up to six months, or a fine of up to {{INRConvert|5000|to=USD GBP AUD}}. It replaced several pieces of anti-dowry legislation that had been enacted by various Indian states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiacode.nic.in/rsPaging.asp?tfnm=196128&amp;Page=1|title=Section 1-4, Dowry Act|author=|date=|website=indiacode.nic.in|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murder and suicide under compulsion are addressed by India's criminal penal code.

Indian women's rights activists campaigned for more than 40 years for laws to contain dowry deaths, such as the ''Dowry Prohibition Act'' 1961 and the more stringent [[Dowry law in India#IPC Section 498A|Section 498a of Indian Penal Code]] (enacted in 1983). Under the ''[[Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005]]'' (PWDVA), a woman can put a stop to the dowry harassment by approaching a domestic violence protection officer.

Although Indian laws against dowries have been in effect for decades, they have been largely criticised as being ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Practical Steps towards Eliminating Dowry and Bride-Burning in India|last = Manchandia|first = Purna|journal = Tul.

==Pakistan==
In Pakistan, the giving and expectation of a dowry (called ''Jahez'') is part of the culture, with over 95% of marriages in every region of Pakistan involving transfer of a dowry from the bride's family to a groom's family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/ayp0102.pdf Zeba Sathar, Cynthia Lloyd, et al.

There is some controversy on the dowry death rates in Pakistan. Some publications suggest Pakistan officials do not record dowry deaths, the death rates are culturally under-reported and may be significantly higher. For example, Nasrullah reports total average annual stove burn rates of 33 per 100,000 women in Pakistan, of which 49% were intentional, or an average annual rate of about 16 per 100,000 women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nasrullah | first1 =  | last2 = Muazzam | first2 =  | year = 2010 | title = Newspaper reports: a source of surveillance for burns among women in Pakistan | url = | journal = Journal of Public Health | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 245–249 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://womensenews.org/story/domestic-violence/021027/pakistans-fiery-shame-women-die-stove-deaths#.UiTpaeC5N5g Juliette Terzieff (October 27, 2002) "Pakistan's Fiery Shame: Women Die in Stove Deaths"] ''[[WeNews]]'', New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = B.

Pakistan's ''Dowry and Marriage Gifts (Restriction) Bill'', 2008, restricts dowry to PKR 30,000 (~US$300) while the total value of bridal gifts is limited to PKR 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/lahore/09-Jun-2013/done-to-a-daughter-over-dowry  Ashraf Javed (June 9, 2013) "Done to a daughter over dowry"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901083633/http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/lahore/09-Jun-2013/done-to-a-daughter-over-dowry |date=2013-09-01 }}, ''The Nation'' (Pakistan)&lt;/ref&gt; The law made demands for a dowry by the groom's family illegal, as well as public display of dowry before or during the wedding. However, this and similar anti-dowry laws of 1967, 1976 and 1998, as well as ''Family Court Act'' of 1964 have proven to be unenforceable. Activists such as SACHET, Pakistan claim the police refuse to register and prosecute allegations of dowry-related domestic violence and fatal injuries.&lt;ref name=sachet/&gt;

Various military and democratically elected civil governments in Pakistan have tried to outlaw traditional display of dowry and expensive parties (''walima''). One such attempt was the Act of 1997, Ordinance (XV) of 1998 and Ordinance (III) of 1999. These were challenged in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The petitioner cited a number of [[hadith]]s under religious [[Sharia]] laws to demonstrate that Islam encouraged ''walima'' and related customary practices. The petitioner claimed that the Pakistan government's effort to enact these laws are against the injunctions of Islam. The Supreme Court ruled these laws and ordinances unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=sachet&gt;[http://www.sachet.org.pk/web/page.asp?id=293 (2006) Fight Against Dowry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108002609/http://www.sachet.org.pk/web/page.asp?id=293 |date=November 8, 2014 }}, SACHET (Pakistan); also see Dr. A.Q. Khan's July 2003 foreword on widespread Dowry problems to the Prime Minister of Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bangladesh==

In Bangladesh, dowry is called joutuk, and a significant cause of deaths as well. Between 0.6 and 2.8 brides per year per 100,000 women are reported to die because of dowry-related violence in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Shahnaz Huda (2006), [http://sar.sagepub.com/content/26/3/249.short Dowry in Bangladesh: Compromizing Women’s Rights], South Asia Research, November vol. 26 no. 3, pages 249-268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/?p=4592 Women’s Safety: Ghosts on the Prowl] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109202405/http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/?p=4592 |date=November 9, 2014 }} Mahfuzur Rahman, Dhaka Courier, January 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The methods of death include suicides, fire and other forms of domestic violence. In 2013, Bangladesh reported 4,470 women were victims of dowry-related violence over a 10-month period, or dowry violence victimized about 7.2 brides per year per 100,000 women in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=UNBangladeshDowry&gt;UN Women, [http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/Headquarters/Attachments/Sections/CSW/59/National_reviews/Bangladesh_review_Beijing20.pdf Bangladesh Report 2014 - Annexes] United Nations (May 2014), Table 6 page xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iran==
Dowry is an ancient custom of Persia, and locally called ''jahâz'' (sometimes spelled ''jahiziyeh'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.2.steingass.125920 Steingass Persian-English], University of Chicago, See explanation for Jahiz&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aryanpour.com/ Persian English Dictionary] see Dowry&lt;/ref&gt; Dowry-related violence and deaths in Iran are reported in Iranian newspapers, some of which appear in English media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6TxY3lsAL?url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2010/08/selected-headlines-202.html Isfahan man kills daughter over inability to pay dowry] Public Broadcasting Service, Washington DC (August 16, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Kiani et al., in a 2014 study, report dowry deaths in Iran.&lt;ref name="Kiani 2014"/&gt;

==International efforts at eradication==
Reports of incidents of dowry deaths have attracted public interest and sparked a global activist movement seeking to end the practice. Of this activist community, the [[United Nations]] (UN) has played a pivotal role in combating violence against women, including dowry deaths.

===United Nations===
The United Nations has been an advocate for women's rights since its inception in 1945, explicitly stating so in its Charter's Preamble,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter of the United Nations: Preamble |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/preamble.shtml |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005192604/http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/preamble.shtml |archivedate=2012-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (adopted in 1948), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.html|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=2012-09-04}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; (adopted in 1966), the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights |accessdate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303114220/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm |archivedate=2012-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (also adopted in 1966) (these three documents are known collectively as the [[International Bill of Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Law|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2012).

The [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), though predominately focused on improving the quality of education available to children globally, has also taken a proactive stance against dowry death. On March 9 ([[International Women's Day]]), 2009, at a press conference in Washington D.C., UNICEF's Executive Director, Ann M. Veneman, publicly condemned dowry deaths and the legislative systems which allow the culprits to go unpunished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of UNICEF Executive Director Ann M. Veneman on International Women's Day|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_35134.html|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, UNICEF launched its first Strategic Priority Action Plan for Gender Equality, which was followed by a second Action Plan in 2010. The aim of these plans has been to make gender equality a higher priority within all international UNICEF programs and functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNICEF Strategic Priority Action Plan for Gender Equality: 2010-2012|publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private organizations===
[[Amnesty International]], in an effort to educate the public, has cited dowry deaths as a major contributor to global violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Violence Against Women Information|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/violence-against-women-information|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in their annual human rights evaluations, Amnesty International criticizes India for the occurrences of dowry deaths as well as the impunity provided to its perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/india|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] has also criticized the Indian government for its inability to make any progress towards eliminating dowry deaths and its lackluster performance for bringing its perpetrators to justice in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India: Disappointing Year for Human Rights|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/23/india-disappoint-year-human-rights|work=2012-09-04|publisher=Human Rights Watch|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108100328/http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/23/india-disappoint-year-human-rights|archivedate=2014-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the Global Fund for Women launched its "Now or Never" funding project. This campaign hopes to raise funds domestically and consequently finance the efforts of feminist organizations across the globe - including Indian women's rights activists. {{as of|2007}} the Now or Never fund has raised and distributed about $7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Her Majesty Queen Noor and Nancy Pelosi Join GFW to Announce Endowment for the World's Women|url=http://www.globalfundforwomen.org/impact/media-center/news-releases/45/157|publisher=Global Fund For Women|accessdate=2012-09-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108092436/http://www.globalfundforwomen.org/impact/media-center/news-releases/45/157|archivedate=2014-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively smaller organization, V-Day, has dedicated itself to ending violence against women. By arranging events such as plays, art shows, and workshops in communities and college campuses across the United States, V-Day raises funds and educates the public on topics of gender-based violence including dowry death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dowry Deaths &amp; Bride Burning|url=http://www.vday.org/bride+death|publisher=V-Day|accessdate=2012-09-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603074440/http://www.vday.org/bride+death|archivedate=2013-06-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full-length plays on dowry deaths include 'The Bride Who Would Not Burn'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urRejbq8dbs|title=YouTube|author=|date=|website=www.youtube.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Explorer 1''' was the first [[satellite]] of the [[United States]], launched as part of its participation in the [[International Geophysical Year]]. The mission followed the first two satellites the previous year; the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Sputnik 1]] and [[Sputnik 2|2]], beginning the [[Cold War]] [[Space Race]] between the two nations.

Explorer 1 was launched on January 31, 1958 at 22:48 Eastern Time (February 1, 03:48 UTC) atop the first [[Juno I|Juno]] booster from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 26|LC-26]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral Missile Annex]], Florida. It was the first spacecraft to detect the [[Van Allen radiation belt]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dickson, ''Sputnik: The Launch of the Space Race. (Toronto: MacFarlane Walter &amp; Ross, 2001), 190.''&lt;/ref&gt; returning data until its batteries were exhausted after nearly four months. It remained in orbit until 1970, and has been followed by more than 90 scientific spacecraft in the [[Explorer program|Explorer series]].

Explorer 1 was given [[Satellite Catalog Number]] 4, and the [[Harvard University|Harvard designation]] 1958 Alpha 1,&lt;ref name="Yost"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Yost | first=Charles W. | date=1963-09-06 | title=Registration data for United States Space Launches | publisher=[[United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs]] | url=http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/pdf/inf044E.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the forerunner to the modern [[International Designator]].

==Background==
The U.S. Earth satellite program began in 1954 as a joint [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] proposal, called [[Project Orbiter]], to put a scientific satellite into [[orbit]] during the [[International Geophysical Year]]. The proposal, using a military [[Redstone (rocket)|Redstone]] missile, was rejected in 1955 by the [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]] in favor of the Navy's [[Project Vanguard]], using a booster advertised as more civilian in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Bille and Erika Lishock, The First Space Race: Launching the World's First Satellites, Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2004, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,937919-1,00.html | title=Project Vanguard—Why It Failed to Live Up to Its Name | accessdate=2008-02-12 | date=October 21, 1957 | publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the launch of the Soviet satellite [[Sputnik 1]] on October 4, 1957, the initial Project Orbiter program was revived as the Explorer program to catch up with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="space age"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/ | title=Sputnik and the Dawn of the Space Age | accessdate=2008-02-13 | work=NASA History | publisher=[[NASA]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explorer 1 was designed and built by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), while a [[Jupiter-C]] rocket was modified by the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] (ABMA) to accommodate a satellite [[payload (air and space craft)|payload]]; the resulting rocket known as the [[Juno I]]. The Jupiter-C design used for the launch had already been flight-tested in [[nose cone]] [[Atmospheric reentry|reentry]] tests for the [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter]] [[intermediate-range ballistic missile|IRBM]], and was modified into Juno I. Working closely together, ABMA and JPL completed the job of modifying the Jupiter-C and building Explorer 1 in 84 days. However, before work was completed, the Soviet Union launched a second satellite, [[Sputnik 2]], on November 3, 1957. The U.S. Navy's attempt to put the first U.S. satellite into orbit failed with the launch of the [[Vanguard TV3]] on December 6, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4202/cover.htm | title=Chapter 11: from Sputnik I to TV-3 | accessdate=2008-02-13 | last=McLaughlin Green | first=Constance |author2=Lomask, Milton | year=1970 | work=Vanguard—A History | publisher=[[NASA]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spacecraft design==
{{refimprove|section|date=January 2018}}&lt;!--3 paragraphs without citations--&gt;
[[File:Explorer1 preparations.jpg|thumb|left|Explorer 1 is mated to its booster at LC-26]]

Explorer 1 was designed and built by the [[California Institute of Technology]]'s JPL under the direction of Dr. [[William Hayward Pickering|William H. Pickering]]. It was the second satellite to carry a mission payload (Sputnik 2 was the first).

The total mass of the satellite was 13.37 kilograms (30.80&amp;nbsp;lb), of which 8.3&amp;nbsp;kg (18.3&amp;nbsp;lb) were instrumentation. In comparison, the mass of the first Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 was 83.6&amp;nbsp;kg (184&amp;nbsp;lb). The instrument section at the front end of the satellite and the empty scaled-down [[MGM-29 Sergeant|fourth-stage rocket casing]] orbited as a single unit, spinning around its long axis at 750 revolutions per minute.

Data from the scientific instruments was transmitted to the ground by two [[antenna (radio)|antennas]]. A 60 milliwatt transmitter fed a [[dipole antenna]] consisting of two fiberglass [[slot antenna]]s in the body of the satellite operating on 108.03 [[hertz|MHz]], and four flexible whips forming a [[turnstile antenna]] were fed by a 10 milliwatt transmitter operating on 108.00&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name="data sheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Williams, Jr. | first=W.E. |date=April 1960 | title=Space Telemetry Systems | journal=Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers | volume=48 | issue=4 | pages=685–690 | publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] | doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1960.287448 | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?isnumber=4066036&amp;arnumber=4066076&amp;count=63&amp;index=39 | format=fee required | accessdate=2008-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the limited space available and the requirements for low weight, the payload instrumentation was designed and built with simplicity and high reliability in mind, using [[germanium]] and [[silicon]] [[transistor]]s in its electronics.&lt;ref name="semiconductormuseum"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://semiconductormuseum.com/Transistors/LectureHall/Ludwig/Ludwig_Index.htm | title=The First Transistors in Space—Personal Reflections by the Designer of the Cosmic Ray Instrumentation Package for the Explorer I Satellite | accessdate=2008-02-25 | work=A Transistor Museum Interview with Dr. George Ludwig | publisher=The Transistor Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 29 transistors were used in Explorer 1, plus additional ones in the Army's micrometeorite amplifier. Electrical power was provided by [[mercury battery|mercury chemical batteries]] that made up approximately 40 percent of the payload weight.

The external skin of the instrument section was sandblasted stainless steel with white stripes.  Several other color schemes had been tested, resulting in backup articles, models, and photographs showing different configurations, including alternate white and green striping and blue stripes alternating with copper.  The final coloration was determined by studies of shadow–sunlight intervals based on firing time, [[trajectory]], [[orbit]], and [[inclination]].[[File:Explorer1 sketch.jpg|frame|center|300 px|''Explorer 1 schematic'']]

==Science payload==
[[File:1958-02-03 First US Satellite Launched.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=3|[[Universal Newsreel]] about the satellite]] 
The Explorer 1 payload consisted of the Iowa [[Cosmic Ray]] Instrument without a tape data recorder which was not modified in time to make it onto the spacecraft. The real-time data received on the ground was therefore very sparse and puzzling showing normal counting rates and no counts at all. The later Explorer 3 mission, which included a tape data recorder in the payload, provided the additional data for confirmation of the earlier Explorer&amp;nbsp;1 data.

The scientific instrumentation of Explorer 1 was designed and built under the direction of Dr. [[James Van Allen]] of the [[University of Iowa]] containing:&lt;ref name="data sheet"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/expinfo.html | title=Explorer-I and Jupiter-C | accessdate=2008-02-09 | work=Data Sheet | publisher=Department of Astronautics, [[National Air and Space Museum]], [[Smithsonian Institution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Anton 314 omnidirectional [[Geiger-Müller tube]], designed by [[George H. Ludwig|Dr. George Ludwig]] of Iowa's Cosmic Ray Laboratory, to detect [[cosmic ray]]s. It could detect [[proton]]s with E &gt; 30&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]] and [[electron]]s with E &gt; 3&amp;nbsp;MeV. Most of the time the instrument was [[wikt:saturation|saturated]];&lt;ref name="cosmic ray detector"&gt;

* Five [[thermometer|temperature sensors]] (one internal, three external and one on the nose cone);
* Acoustic detector (crystal [[transducer]] and solid-state [[amplifier]]) to detect [[micrometeoroid|micrometeorite]] ([[cosmic dust]]) impacts. It responded to micrometeorite impacts on the spacecraft skin in such a way that each impact would be a function of [[mass]] and [[velocity]]. Its effective area was 0.075&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the average threshold sensitivity was 2.5{{e|−3}}&amp;nbsp;g&amp;nbsp;cm/s;&lt;ref name="micrometeorite detector"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1958-001A-02 | title=Micrometeorite Detector | accessdate=2008-02-09 | work=NSSDC Master Catalog | publisher=[[NASA]]

* Wire grid detector, also to detect micrometeorite impacts. It consisted of 12 parallel connected cards mounted in a [[fiberglass]] supporting ring. Each card was wound with two layers of [[enameled wire|enameled]] [[nickel]] [[alloy]] wire with a diameter of 17&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] (21&amp;nbsp;µm with the enamel insulation included) in such way that a total area of 1&amp;nbsp;cm by 1&amp;nbsp;cm was completely covered. If a micrometeorite of about 10&amp;nbsp;µm impacted, it would fracture the wire, destroy the electrical connection, and thus record the event.&lt;ref name="micrometeorite detector"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manring"/&gt;

Explorer 1 changed [[rotation|rotation axis]] after launch. The elongated body of the spacecraft had been designed to spin about its long (least-[[inertia]]) axis but refused to do so, and instead started [[precession|precessing]] due to energy [[dissipation]] from flexible structural elements. Later it was understood that on general grounds, the body ends up in the spin state that minimizes the [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] [[rotational energy]] for a fixed angular momentum (this being the maximal-inertia axis). This motivated the first further development of the [[Leonhard Euler|Eulerian]] theory of [[rigid body kinetics|rigid body dynamics]] after nearly 200 years{{mdash}}to address this kind of momentum-preserving energy dissipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Efroimsky | first=Michael |date=August 2001 | title=Relaxation of wobbling asteroids and comets—theoretical problems, perspectives of experimental observation | journal=Planetary and Space Science | volume=49 | issue=9 | pages=937–955 | publisher=[[Elsevier]] | doi=10.1016/S0032-0633(01)00051-4 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063301000514 | format=fee required | accessdate=2015-10-04 | bibcode=2001P&amp;SS...49..937E|arxiv = astro-ph/9911072 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Efroimsky | first=Michael |date=March 2002 | title=Euler, Jacobi, and missions to comets and asteroids | journal=Advances in Space Research | volume=29 | issue=5 | pages=725–734 | publisher=[[Elsevier]] | doi=10.1016/S0273-1177(02)00017-0 | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/02731177/2002/00000029/00000005/art00017 | format=fee required | accessdate=2008-02-05 |arxiv = astro-ph/0112054 |bibcode = 2002AdSpR..29..725E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the instrumentation reported the expected cosmic ray count (approximately 30 counts per second) but other times it would show a peculiar zero counts per second. The University of Iowa (under [[James Van Allen]]) observed that all of the zero counts per second reports were from an altitude of more than {{convert|2000|km|miles}} over South America, while passes at {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} would show the expected level of cosmic rays. Later, after [[Explorer 3]], it was concluded that the original Geiger counter had been overwhelmed ("saturated") by strong radiation coming from a belt of charged particles trapped in space by the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. This belt of charged particles is now known as the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]. The discovery was considered to be one of the outstanding discoveries of the International Geophysical Year.

The acoustic micrometeorite detector detected 145 impacts of cosmic dust in 78,750 seconds. This calculates to an average impact rate of 8.0{{e|−3}} impacts m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; over the twelve-day period (29 impacts per hour per square meter).&lt;ref name="dubin"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dubin | first=Maurice |date=January 1960 | title=IGY Micrometeorite Measurements | journal=Space Research—Proceedings of the First International Space Science Symposium | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=1042–1058 | publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company | location=Amsterdam | url=http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA285101 | format=fee required | accessdate=2008-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Explorer 1 was the first of the long-running [[Explorer program]]. A follow-up to the first mission, [[Explorer-1'|Explorer-1 [PRIME]]], was successfully launched aboard a [[Delta II]] rocket in late October, 2011. The PRIME was built using modern satellite construction techniques.  The orbiting satellite was a backup, since the initial Explorer-1 PRIME, launched on March 4, 2011, failed to reach orbit due to a problem in the launch vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://ssel.montana.edu/msus-twin-satellite-to-launch-oct-28-on-nasa-rocket/|title=MSU’s twin satellite to launch Oct. 28 on NASA rocket|accessdate=1 October 2013|date=23 October 2011|work=Space Science and Engineering Laboratory|author=Evelyn Boswell|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005021134/https://ssel.montana.edu/msus-twin-satellite-to-launch-oct-28-on-nasa-rocket/|archivedate=5 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An identically constructed flight backup of Explorer 1 is on display in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]], Milestones of Flight Gallery in Washington, DC.

[[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 26|Launch Pad 26]] was deactivated in 1963, and was designated for use as a museum in 1964, the [[Air Force Space and Missile Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afspacemuseum.org/displays/LC26blockhouse/ Launch Complex 26 Blockhouse]&lt;/ref&gt;  Here too, a full-scale Explorer 1 is on display, but this one is a mockup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afspacemuseum.org/displays/ExplorerI/ Explorer I]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Explorer 1 was the first orbital object to return scientific data.  Its launch happened 100 years to the day after the [[SS Great Eastern]] was launched.  The ship was larger than any that came before it, and accomplished laying the first lasting [[transatlantic telegraph cable]].  Both events served to more closely knit the world together.

'''FLISoL''', an acronym for '''Festival Latinoamericano de Instalación de Software Libre''' (Latin American free software [[Installfest|install fest]]), is the biggest event for spreading ''[[Software Libre]]'' since 2005, performed simultaneously in different countries of [[Latin America]]. In 2012, more than 290 cities from 20 countries of Latin America participated on a FLISoL.

This festival is an opportunity for all those people interested on know more about Software Libre. Getting involved makes it possible to get in touch with the world of Software Libre, meet other users, resolve doubts and questions, exchange opinions and experiences, attend to informative talks and others activities.

==Objective==
Introduce [[Software Libre]] by its most known representative: [[Linux]]; or by installing Software Libre like [[LibreOffice]], [[GIMP]], [[Firefox]] and many more. During the event, operating systems or other free alternatives are installed for free to people who want to on their computers.

Also talks are given along with papers and workshops about local, national and [[Latin American]] topics related to ''Software Libre'' and its movement.

Is important to know, that the objective itself is to create a link and promote migration between the users (newbies and advanced) and ''Software Libre''.

"'''Fifteen'''" is a [[country pop]] song performed by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. Swift self-penned the song and co-produced it along with [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]]. "Fifteen" was released on August 30, 2009 by [[Big Machine Records]], as the fourth [[single (music)|single]] from Swift's second studio album, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008). The song was inspired by Swift's [[freshman year]] of high school at [[Hendersonville High School (Tennessee)|Hendersonville High School]], where she first encountered heartbreak, along with her best friend Abigail Anderson. After writing it, Swift asked Anderson for authorization to record the song (due to personal references in the song); Anderson affirmed and it was ultimately included on ''Fearless''. "Fifteen" is a [[ballad]], which has Swift reminiscing on events that occurred to her and her best friend at the age of 15 and cautioning teenagers to not fall in love easily.

"Fifteen" peaked at number 23 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and sold over 1.5 million digital downloads in the United States. The [[music video]] for "Fifteen" was directed by [[Roman White]]. It was filmed using a [[Chroma key|green screen]] and is heavily accentuated with special effects. The video features Swift walking through a garden, where she relives many memories with Anderson. It received a nomination for the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]] category at the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards]], but lost to [[Lady Gaga]]'s "[[Bad Romance]]". "Fifteen" was promoted with live performances, including many that were part of Swift's first and second headlining tours, the [[Fearless Tour]] (2009—10) and the [[Speak Now World Tour]] (2011–12). Swift partnered with electronics retailer [[Best Buy]] for @15, a program that allowed teens to help decide how funds would be distributed among various charities.

==Background==
[[File:Tayswift fifteen sitting.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|Swift performing "Fifteen" during the [[Fearless Tour]] in 2009.]]
Swift began writing "Fifteen" with the lyric "And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy/ Who changed his mind/ We both cried", which eventually became the song's [[bridge (music)|bridge]], and continued writing everything else in a backwards manner.&lt;ref name="cutbycut"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigmachinerecords.com/taylorswift/index.cfm?id=110 |title=Cut By Cut |first=Taylor |last=Swift |authorlink=Taylor Swift |work=''Bigmachinerecords.com'' |publisher=[[Big Machine Records]] |accessdate=March 12, 2010 |archivedate=April 3, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403025349/http://www.bigmachinerecords.com/taylorswift/index.cfm?id=110 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was written about Swift's [[Student|freshman year]] of high school at Hendersonville High School,&lt;ref name="cutbycut" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2009/11/09/taylor-swift-to-share-cma-spotlight-with-hendersonville-high-school-students/|title=Taylor Swift to share CMA spotlight with Hendersonville High School students|first=Teena|last=Lee|date=November 9, 2009|work=[[The Tennessean]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she met her best friend Abigail Anderson.&lt;ref name="hotdish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/hot-dish/1596320/hot-dish-taylor-swift-talks-about-songwriting-friends-and-good-manners.jhtml|title=HOT DISH: Taylor Swift Talks About Songwriting, Friends and Good Manners|first=Hazel|last=Smith|date=October 6, 2008|work=[[CMT News]]|publisher=[[Viacom]]|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I just decided I really wanted to tell that story about our first year of high school because I felt in my freshman year, I grew up more than any year in my life so far", Swift stated.&lt;ref name="cutbycut" /&gt; The events it focused on were how both Swift and Anderson fell in love for the first time, but both suffered of heartbreaks.&lt;ref name="hotdish" /&gt; Aside from reminiscing on the events she and Anderson experienced, Swift wrote cautionary lyrics, intended to target teenage girls entering or already in their freshman year of high school. She described it as incorporating things she wished someone would have told her in a song when she was younger.&lt;ref name="onsetfifteen"&gt;{{cite episode|title=On the Set Behind the Scenes 'Fifteen'|minutes=22:00|series=Taylor Swift: On the Set|network=Great American Country|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The thing about high school, you don't know anything. You don't know anything, but you think you know everything", Swift said.&lt;ref name="hotdish" /&gt;

After the completion of composing "Fifteen", Swift became very nervous to show Anderson the song, for she did not know how her friend would respond. "It was a really personal song, especially from her angle of it." However, when Swift performed the song for Anderson and asked whether she was comfortable with the song, Anderson confirmed: "She said, 'Does it bother you that your name is in a song that's so personal?' And it really doesn't just because of the way Taylor and I feel about it. If one girl can kind of learn from it or connect to a song like that, it's totally worth it."&lt;ref name="onsetfifteen" /&gt; With Anderson's consent, Swift recorded "Fifteen" with producer [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]], who produced all but one track on Swift's 2006 [[Taylor Swift (album)|eponymous debut album]], ''Taylor Swift''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1546980/when-she-thinks-tim-mcgraw-taylor-swift-savors-payoff.jhtml|title=When She Thinks "Tim McGraw," Taylor Swift Savors Payoff: Hardworking Teen to Open for George Strait Next Year|date=December 1, 2006|first=Edward|last=Morris|work=CMT News|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recording the highly personal track caused Swift to cry. Swift attributed the event to the fact that she is most likely to cry over when her loved ones undergo pain, as she witnesses it, rather than her own experiences. She went to say "Fifteen" usually gets her every time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1599049/taylor-swifts-fascination-with-fairy-tales-comes-through-on-new-album.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift's fascination with Fairy Tales comes through on new album|first=Lindsey|last=Roznovsky|date=November 10, 2008|work=''[[Country Music Television|CMT News]]''|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Fifteen" is a [[country pop]] song with a length of four minutes and 55 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1436466|pure_url=yes}}|title=Fearless - Taylor Swift|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is set in [[Time signature|common time]] and has a moderate [[tempo]] of 96 beats per minute.&lt;ref name="sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital sheet music – Taylor Swift – Fifteen|accessdate=April 16, 2010|work=''Musicnotes.com''|publisher=[[Alfred Music Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track is categorized as a [[ballad (music)|ballad]].&lt;ref name="newsok"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2010/04/01/concert-review-taylor-swift-at-oklahoma-citys-ford-center/ |title=Concert review: Taylor Swift brings "Fearless" show to Ford Center |first=Brandy |last=McDonnel |date=April 1, 2010 |work=[[The Oklahoman]] |publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company |accessdate=May 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707153507/http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2010/04/01/concert-review-taylor-swift-at-oklahoma-citys-ford-center/ |archivedate=July 7, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is written in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[G major]] and Swift's vocals spans a little over two [[octave]]s, from G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="sheet" /&gt; It follows the [[chord progression]] Gsus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–Csus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–Em–Csus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="sheet" /&gt; It concludes with an [[Conclusion (music)|outro]] that consists of Swift singing "la la la"&lt;ref name="slant" /&gt; and rephrasing the song's opening lines.&lt;ref name="sheet" /&gt;

The lyrics of "Fifteen" have Swift narrating about multiple events. In the first [[Song structure (popular music)|verse]], Swift details first entering high school with intentions of merely staying out of her peers' way. The second verse bears Swift meeting Anderson and gossiping about the school's [[queen bee]]s with her. Successively, Swift describes first dates&lt;ref name="paste" /&gt; and falling in love for the first time.&lt;ref name="villagevoice" /&gt; However, Swift and Anderson become heartbroken, revealing that Anderson "gave everything she had" to someone who later changed his mind.&lt;ref name="slant" /&gt; The song's [[refrain]]s have Swift cautioning young girls to not fall in love easily&lt;ref name="topabout" /&gt; and acknowledging that she came to the realization of being able to accomplish more than dating a football team member.&lt;ref name="villagevoice" /&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[Jody Rosen]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' believed "Fifteen" was exemplary in that "Swift is a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture". Rosen compared her songwriting in the track to that of producers [[Dr. Luke]] and [[Max Martin]], who he referred to as "Swedish pop gods". He continued, "Her music mixes an almost impersonal professionalism — it's so rigorously crafted it sounds like it has been scientifically engineered in a hit factory — with confessions that are squirmingly intimate and true."&lt;ref name="rollingstone"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/fearless-20081113|title=Taylor Swift - Fearless|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|accessdate=March 21, 2010|date=November 13, 2008|first=Jody|last=Rosen|authorlink=Jody Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathon Keefe of [[Slant Magazine]] considered the bridge one of the nicer moments of ''Fearless'', but was unimpressed with Swift's singing, particularly in the outro.&lt;ref name="slant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/taylor-swift-fearless/1574|first=Jonathan|last=Keefe|date=November 16, 2008|title=Taylor Swift: Fearless|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|accessdate=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] found "Fifteen", in which Swift portrayed the role of a big sister instead of a big star, to be one of the best and the most personal song on ''Fearless''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1436466|pure_url=yes}}|title=Fearless - Taylor Swift|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken Tucker of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine believed "Fifteen" could appeal with teenagers looking for hope and adult women reminiscing the past.&lt;ref name="billboardreview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ken|first=Tucker|date=November 15, 2008|title=Albums: Fearless|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Nielsen Company|Nielsen Business Media, Inc]]|location=New York|volume=120|issue=45|pages=60|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OBMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Billboard+Taylor+Swift+Fearless+review&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vLeHTfqcD4yatwfVtJX4Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leah Greenbelt of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated, "When she sings about sexuality, she sounds like a real teen, not some manufactured vixen-[[Lolita (term)|Lolita]]".&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20237814,00.html|title=Fearless (2008)|date=November 5, 2008|first=Leah|last=Greenblatt|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|accessdate=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The [[music video]] for "Fifteen" was directed by [[Roman White]], who previously directed Swift's music video "[[You Belong with Me]]". White began with the intention of creating a video different than others Swift did in the past. To do so, he believed he needed to set the video outside of high school. White explained, "Well, I think I really wanted this video to kind of be an evolution for Taylor [...] I actually said to her, 'I don't think we should shoot in a high school.' And I don't think she wanted to either."&lt;ref name="mtvvideo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1646390/taylor-swift-flashed-back-high-school-vmanominated-fifteen.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift Flashed Back To High School For VMA-Nominated 'Fifteen'|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|date=August 28, 2010|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; White conceptualized the video's setting by taking into account the literal meaning of the song and transforming into something new.&lt;ref name="mtvvideo" /&gt; He conceptualized the setting to be a new world where Swift could revisit her memories, as they manifest around her.&lt;ref name="romancmt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.cmt.com/2009-10-09/roman-white-makes-country-music-come-to-life/|title=Roman White Makes Country Music Come to Life|first=Alison|last=Bunaguro|date=October 9, 2009|work=CMT News|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Let's take the literal meaning of this song and watch it evolve in front of us ... almost as a memory in your head. And create this world, somewhere you walk in on this desolate desert and you start to sing about all these great memories you have... of everything you love blooming around you, and so we literally grew this garden around her", White said.&lt;ref name="mtvvideo" /&gt;  The world moved from one situation to the next.&lt;ref name="framebyframe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/?id=1646388|title=Frame by Frame: Taylor Swift's Video for 'Fifteen'|work=[[MTV]]|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; White decided to annex surreal elements to create a cross between a garden and the heart of the memories.&lt;ref name="mtvvideo" /&gt; He intertwined Swift's emotions with the growth of the garden. The garden grew when Swift felt happy, but at the sight of pain and negative emotions, clouds appear and the garden dies, which also symbolized Swift's best friend Abigail Anderson's broken heart.&lt;ref name="framebyframe" /&gt;

[[File:Taylor Swift - Fifteen music video.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Swift and her best friend Abigail Anderson reliving memories in the music video for "Fifteen"]]
Swift's friend, Anderson, portrayed herself in the video. The love interests of both Swift and Anderson were cast by Swift after she received images of them via e-mail.&lt;ref name="onsetfifteen" /&gt; The video was filmed in two days. The first day consisted of actors, including Swift and Anderson, filming before a [[green screen]].&lt;ref name="onsetfifteen" /&gt; On the set, White presented Swift with caricature drawings depicting the music video, in order to guide herself.&lt;ref name="onsetfifteen" /&gt; Swift was impressed by Anderson's acting skills, considering her lack of experience, and called it "prolific".&lt;ref name="onsetfifteen" /&gt; On the second day, scenes at a high school were filmed; [[Rainmaking|artificial rain]] was made.&lt;ref name="onsetfifteen" /&gt; Afterward, White and a team of [[Visual effects|visual effect artist]]s created the setting. "If you watch just the offline edit of this video, it's just green. It's just Taylor walking around a giant green screen. And to think that every single thing in that video was created is amazing, 'cause a lot of people worked really hard on it", White said.&lt;ref name="recallskanye"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1646416/taylor-swift-video-director-recalls-kanye-wests-2009-vma-rant.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift Video Director Recalls Kanye West's 2009 VMA Rant|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|date=August 25, 2010|work=MTV News|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visual effects team were at work for the video for some time, sometimes staying overnight in the office to produce the video.&lt;ref name="recallskanye" /&gt; The direction was to make the video seem "magical".&lt;ref name="framebyframe" /&gt; Some of the props used when filming were recreated using digital animation, such as the door and the desks.&lt;ref name="mtvvideo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="framebyframe" /&gt; Because extras were filmed separately, White was meticulous to find the right shots to make the scene more cohesive.&lt;ref name="framebyframe" /&gt; White believed the finished product had a sense of innocence.&lt;ref name="romancmt" /&gt;

The video begins with Swift, barefoot and clad in a white sundress, approaching a tall, arched doorway which materializes in the middle of a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down beside her and the two begin to whisper and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake [[Taylor Guitars|Taylor]] brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and hugs her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and hugging her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 140 million views on [[YouTube]].

===Video reception===
The music video premiered on October 9, 2009 on [[Country Music Television|CMT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1623470/taylor-swifts-new-video-fifteen-debuts-friday-on-cmt.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift's New Video, "Fifteen," Debuts Friday on CMT|date=October 8, 2009|work=CMT News|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Gicas of [[E!]] thought the video was "sweet" and said, "And while the visuals here—Taylor walking in and out of various animated scenes—are certainly nice to look at, they nevertheless take a back seat to the country star's cuteness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b148188_taylor_swift_brings_sweet_fifteen_video.html#ixzz1Gz7d13Ib|title=Taylor Swift Brings Sweet "Fifteen" Video|first=Peter|last=Gicas|date=October 9, 2009|work=[[E!]]|publisher=[[Comcast]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leah Greenblatt of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' graded the video a B.

Swift recently performed the song on her [[1989 World Tour]] in place of You Are In Love during the first shows in Chicago, Edmonton, Denver, St. Paul, Tampa, &amp; Arlington, the second shows in Toronto, Foxborough and Melbourne, the third show in Los Angeles, and in Atlanta.

This song was most recently performed on her [[Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour|Reputation Stadium Tour]] as the surprise song for her second show in London.

==@15==
Swift partnered with electronics retailer [[Best Buy]] for @15, a program that allowed teens to help decide how Best Buy's "@15 Fund" would be distributed among various charities. Swift taped a [[Public service announcement|Public Service Announcement]] (PSA), called a "Teen Service Announcement" by Best Buy, for @15. Within the PSA, which was released on February 9, 2009, scenes of Swift reminiscing on high school and encouraging originality and uniqueness were inter-cut with scenes of her singing "Fifteen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Taylor Swift Lends Support to @15|publisher=[[Best Buy]]|date=February 9, 2009|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS201229+09-Feb-2009+BW20090209|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, @15 became a partner for Swift's Fearless Tour. The announcement was shown at each stop during the North American leg of the tour. In fifteen tour stops, @15 donated forty concert tickets and a guitar autographed by Swift to local teen-oriented charity groups, such as chapters of [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America]] and [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Big Brothers Big Sisters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=@15 Named Official Charitable Partner of the Taylor Swift Fearless 2009 Tour|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS139716+22-Jun-2009+BW20090622|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120630154035/http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS139716+22-Jun-2009+BW20090622|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 30, 2012|publisher=[[Best Buy]]|date=June 22, 2009|accessdate=March 17, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Francisco Nicolás has lived with his grandmother since he was 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madrid.lahaine.org/la-biografia-inedita-y-nada|title=Quesada, Aday. "La biografia inédita y nada inocente del pequeño Nicolás".|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francisco Nicolás allegedly led a double life. While studying law at university he claimed to be an important person with political and business contacts, a claim that he used to take advantage of certain entities and individuals.&lt;ref name="elconfidencial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/galicia/2014/10/18/delirios-narcisistas-vive-abuela-viste-traje-13-anos/0003_201410G18P149911.htm|title=Tiene "delirios narcisistas", vive con su abuela y viste traje desde los 13 años|work=[[La Voz de Galicia]]|date=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly, he defrauded dozens of people, to whom he promised sizable business opportunities, thanks to his alleged contacts at the highest positions of the Spanish Administration, [[Government of Spain|Spanish government]] and even the CNI.&lt;ref name="elconfidencial"/&gt; He leased luxury cars to reinforce his fabricated stories and one of them was found with a blue light similar to that employed by undercover units of the security forces in emergencies and thus skipping red lights and avoiding jams.&lt;ref name="elconfidencial"/&gt; He even hired personal bodyguards to give credibility to his identities.

Currently under investigation is the possible economic and social protection of "El pequeño Nicolás" by a major figure in the Spanish elite, since different sources conclude that it would have been the only way to move up and infiltrate the power elites of this country that easily.

On Tuesday October 14, 2014 he was arrested by the National Police on charges of forgery, fraud and identity theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2014-10-19/el-pequeno-nicolas-utilizo-a-garcia-legaz-y-a-faes-para-engordar-su-curriculum_268869/|title=El pequeño Nicolás utilizó a García-Legaz y a FAES para engordar su currículum|author=Ana I.

{{Short description|Hysiae was an Argive garrison town in Ancient Greece}}
'''Hysiae''' or '''Hysiai''' ({{lang-grc|Ὑσιαί}}), also '''Hysia''' (Ὑσία), was a garrison town of [[ancient Argolis]], also called the [[Argeia (region)|Argeia]], southern [[Greece]] during the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]]. It was located to the southwest of [[Argos]] and east of [[Tegea]], on the road between them, at the foot of [[Mount Parthenium]], not far from the Argive border with [[ancient Laconia|Laconia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Pausanias|2|24|7}}, 8.6.4, 8.54.7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Strabo|viii. p.376}}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{circa|669&amp;nbsp;BCE}}, the [[Battle of Hysiae (c.669 BC)|First Battle of Hysiae]] was fought between the [[ancient Sparta|Spartans]] and the Argives, who won to repulse a Spartan invasion of Argolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Bury | Meiggs | 1975 | p=524}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Pausanias|2|24|7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to have been destroyed by the Argives, along with [[Tiryns]], [[Mycenae]], and the other towns in the Argeia, after the [[Greco-Persian Wars]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Pausanias|8|27|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was afterwards restored, and was occupied by the Argives in the [[Peloponnesian War]] as a frontier-fortress. During the Peloponnesian War, in 417&amp;nbsp;BCE, the [[Battle of Hysiae (417 BC)|Second Battle of Hysiae]] was fought, again between the Spartans and the Argives, and resulted in a decisive Spartan victory. The Spartans captured Hysiae and destroyed it; all captured male citizens were executed.&lt;ref name="ThucV83"&gt;{{harvnb | Thucydides, v.83 | Warner | 1954 | p=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Thucydides|5.83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Diodorus|12.81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its site is located near modern [[Akhladokampos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Barrington|58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DARE|21916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1947–1987 ===
{{See also|Partition of India}}
After independence from colonial rule India and Pakistan [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|fought a war]] over the princely state of [[Kashmir]]. At the end of the war India controlled the most valuable parts of Kashmir.&lt;ref name="SumantraKashmir" /&gt; While there were sporadic periods of violence there was no organised insurgency movement.&lt;ref name="SwamiSecret" /&gt;

During this period legislative elections in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were first held in 1951 and [[Sheikh Abdullah]]’s secular party stood unopposed. He was an instrumental member in the accession of the state to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-12-05/news/44808338_1_omar-abdullah-jammu-and-kashmir-sheikh-abdullah|title=Omar Abdullah hails Sheikh Abdullah's decision to accede J-K to India|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.greaterkashmir.com/news/opinion/story/225175.html|title=Excerpts of Sheikh Abdullah's speech defending the accession .|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110172831/http://m.greaterkashmir.com/news/opinion/story/225175.html|archivedate=10 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However [[Sheikh Abdullah]] would fall in and out of favour with the central government and would often be dismissed only to be re-appointed later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohd|first=Abbas Wani|title=Beginning of Terrorism in Jammu&amp;Kashmir|journal=Indian Streams Research Journal|year=2014|publisher=Laxmi Book Publication|issn=2230-7850}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a time of political instability &amp; power struggle in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and it went through several periods of [[President's rule]] by the [[Federal Government]].&lt;ref name="AltafElections" /&gt;

After [[Sheikh Abdullah]]’s death, his son [[Farooq Abdullah]] took over as [[Chief Minister]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. [[Farooq Abdullah]] eventually fell out of favour with the Central Government and the [[Prime Minister of India]], [[Indira Gandhi]] had him dismissed.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} A year later, Abdullah announced an alliance with the ruling [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] for the elections of 1987. The elections were allegedly rigged in favour of Abdullah.&lt;ref name="AltafElections" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCKashmir" /&gt;

This led to the rise of an armed insurgency movement composed, in part, of those who unfairly lost elections. Pakistan supplied these groups with logistical support, arms, recruits and training.&lt;ref name="AltafElections" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCKashmir" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ArifShadow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HasanPakistan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KhanMilitants" /&gt;

In the second half of 1989 the alleged assassinations of the Indian spies and political collaborators by JKLF (Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front) was intensified. Over six months more than a hundred officials were killed to paralyse government’s administrative and intelligence apparatus. The daughter of then interior affairs minister, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was kidnapped in December and four terrorists had to be released for her release. This event led to mass celebrations all over the valley. Farooq Abdullah resigned in January after the appointment of Jagmohan Malhotra as the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir. Subsequently, J&amp;K was placed under Governor's Rule under Article 92 of [[Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir|state constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kashmir Demysitified|last=Behera|first=Navnita Chadha|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Washington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under JKLF’s leadership on January 21–23 large scale protests were organised in valley. As a response to this largely explosive situation paramilitary units of BSF and CRPF were called. These units were used by the government to combat Maoist insurgency and the North-Eastern insurgency. The challenge to them in this situation was not posed by armed insurgents but by the stone pelters. Their inexperience caused at least 50 casualties in Gawkadal massacre. In this incident the underground militant movement was transformed into a mass struggle. To curb the situation AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act) was imposed on Kashmir in September 1990 to suppress the insurgency by giving armed forces the powers to kill and arrest without warrant to maintain public order. During this time the dominant tactic involved killing of a prominent figure in a public gathering to push forces into action and the public prevented them from capturing these insurgents. This sprouting of sympathisers in Kashmir led to the hard-line approach of Indian army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kashmir Demystified|last=Behera|first=Navnita Chadha|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With JKLF at forefront large number of militant groups like Allah Tigers, People’s League and Hizb-i-Islamia sprung up. Weapons were smuggled on a large scale from Pakistan. In Kashmir JKLF operated under the leadership of Ashfaq Majid Wani, Yasin Bhat, Hamid Shiekh and Javed Mir. To counter this growing pro-Pakistani sentiment in Kashmir, Indian media associated it exclusively with Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kashmir Roots of Conflict Paths to Peace|last=Bose|first=Sumantra|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JKLF used distinctly Islamic themes to mobilise crowds and justify their use of violence. They sought to establish an Islamic democratic state where the rights of minorities would be protected according to Quran and Sunna and economy would be organised on the principles of Islamic socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Demystifying Kashmir|last=Behra|first=Navnita Chadha|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2004–11 ===
{{main|2010 Kashmir unrest}}
Beginning in 2004 Pakistan began to end its support for insurgents in Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Spencer C.|title=Encyclopedia of Insurgency and Counterinsurgency A New Era of Modern Warfare|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO, LLC|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=978-1-61069-279-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happened because terrorist groups linked to Kashmir twice tried to assassinate [[President of Pakistan|Pakistani President]] General [[Pervez Musharraf]].&lt;ref name="KhanMilitants" /&gt; His successor, [[Asif Ali Zardari]] has continued the policy, calling insurgents in Kashmir "terrorists".&lt;ref name="StephensJob" /&gt; Although it is unclear if Pakistan's intelligence agency, the [[Inter-Services Intelligence]], thought to be the agency aiding and controlling the insurgency&lt;ref name="StephensJob" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ColeObama" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RediffKashmir" /&gt; is following Pakistan's commitment to end support for the insurgency in Kashmir.&lt;ref name="StephensJob" /&gt;

Despite the change in the nature of the insurgency from a phenomenon supported by external forces to a primarily domestic-driven movement&lt;ref name="SumantraKashmir" /&gt;&lt;ref name="StephensJob" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EconomistStony" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EconomistPlace" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EconomistGrim" /&gt; the Indian government has continued to send large numbers of troops to the Indian border.&lt;ref name="EconomistStony" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EconomistGrim" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCKillings" /&gt;

There have been widespread protests against the Indian army presence in Kashmir.&lt;ref name="EconomistStony" /&gt;

Once the most formidable face of Kashmir militancy, [[Hizbul Mujahideen]] is slowly fading away as its remaining commanders and cadres are being taken out on a regular interval by security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-19/india/30296919_1_kashmir-valley-security-forces-mohammad-shafi | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729010520/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-19/india/30296919_1_kashmir-valley-security-forces-mohammad-shafi | dead-url=yes | archive-date=29 July 2012 | work=The Times of India | title=Hizbul Mujahideen almost wiped out in Kashmir | date=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some minor incidents of grenade throwing and sniper firing at security forces notwithstanding, the situation is under control and more or less peaceful. A record number of tourists including Amarnath pilgrims visited Kashmir during 2012. On 3 August 2012, a top [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] militant commander, Abu Hanzulah involved in various attacks on civilians and security forces was killed in an encounter with security forces in a village in Kupwara district of north Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Srinagar/J-amp-K-Top-LeT-commander-killed-in-encounter/Article1-907473.aspx |title=J&amp;K: Top LeT commander killed in encounter |date=3 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803100038/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Srinagar/J-amp-K-Top-LeT-commander-killed-in-encounter/Article1-907473.aspx |archivedate=3 August 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for the insurgency ==

===Rigging of 1987 Assembly elections===
{{Further|Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, 1987}}
Following the rise of Islamisation in the Kashmir valley, during the 1987 state elections, various Islamic anti-establishment groups including [[Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir]] were organised under a single banner named [[Muslim United Front]] (MUF), that is largely current [[Hurriyat]]. MUF's election manifesto stressed the need for a solution to all outstanding issues according to [[Simla Agreement]], work for Islamic unity and against political interference from the centre. Their slogan was wanting the law of the Quran in the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkTetMfI6QkC&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Kashmir in Conflict: India, Pakistan and the Unending War|last=Schofield|first=Victoria|date=2000|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=|isbn=9781860648984|location=|pages=137|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the MUF won only four seats, even though it had polled 31% votes in the election. However, the elections were widely believed to be rigged, changing the course of politics in the state. The insurgency was sparked by the apparent rigging of [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, 1987|state elections in 1987]].&lt;ref name="AltafElections" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCKashmir" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/mufti-mohammad-sayeed-shaped-1987-kashmir-elections|title=How Mufti Mohammad Sayeed Shaped the 1987 Elections in Kashmir|date=2016-03-22|work=The Caravan|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428235753/http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/mufti-mohammad-sayeed-shaped-1987-kashmir-elections|archivedate=28 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ISI's role ===
The Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] has allegedly encouraged and aided the Kashmir independence movement through an insurgency&lt;ref name="StephensJob" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ColeObama" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RediffKashmir" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GlobalSecurity" /&gt; due to its dispute on the legitimacy of Indian rule in Kashmir, with the insurgency as an easy way to keep Indian troops distracted and cause international condemnation of India.&lt;ref name="SumantraKashmir" /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Former Pakistan President General [[Pervez Musharraf]] in Oct 2014 said during TV interview, "We have source (in Kashmir) besides the (Pakistan) army…People in Kashmir are fighting against (India). We just need to incite them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan needs to incite those fighting in Kashmir: Musharraf|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/musharraf-pakistan-kashmir-kargil-conflict-militants/1/396106.html|accessdate=22 February 2017|publisher=''[[India Today]]''|date=16 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012065029/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/musharraf-pakistan-kashmir-kargil-conflict-militants/1/396106.html|archivedate=12 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)]], in their first ever open acknowledgement in 2011 in US Court, said that the [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)]] sponsors terrorism in Kashmir and it oversees terrorist separatist groups in Kashmir.&lt;ref name="firstpost1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rediff1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indianexpress1"/&gt;

=== Mujahideen influence ===
After the [[Soviet–Afghan War|invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union]], [[Mujahideen]] fighters, with the aid of Pakistan, slowly infiltrated Kashmir with the goal of spreading a radical Islamist ideology.&lt;ref name="BBCKashmir" /&gt;

=== Religion ===
Jammu and Kashmir is the only Muslim majority state in Hindu-majority India. Indian-American journalist [[Asra Nomani]] states that while India itself is a secular state, Muslims are politically, culturally and economically marginalised when compared to Hindus in India as a whole.&lt;ref name="NomaniMuslims" /&gt; The government's [[Amarnath land transfer controversy|decision]] to transfer 99 acres of forest land in near [[Amarnath Temple|Amarnath]] in the Kashmir valley to a Hindu organisation (for setting up temporary shelters and facilities for Hindu pilgrims) solidified this feeling and led to one of the largest protest rallies in Jammu and Kashmir.&lt;ref name="ThottamValley" /&gt;

=== Human rights abuses ===
{{Main|Human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir}}
After insurgency started in Kashmir valley because of above reasons in the late 1980s, Indian troops entered in Kashmir valley to control the insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hashim|first1=Asad|title=Timeline: India-Pakistan relations|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/kashmirtheforgottenconflict/2011/06/2011615113058224115.html|accessdate=23 February 2017|publisher=''[[Al Jazeera]]''|date=27 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301040548/http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/kashmirtheforgottenconflict/2011/06/2011615113058224115.html|archivedate=1 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts have suggested that the number of Indian troops in Jammu and Kashmir is close to 600,000 although estimates vary and the Indian government refuses to release official figures.&lt;ref name="NathanKashmir" /&gt; The troops have been accused and held accountable for several humanitarian abuses&lt;ref name="EconomistGrim" /&gt; and have engaged in [[Human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir#Indian Armed Forces|mass extrajudicial killings, torture]], [[Rape during the Kashmir conflict#Rape by Indian forces .28post-1988.29|rape and sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name="BBCKillings" /&gt;

Indian security forces have been implicated in many reports for [[enforced disappearances]] of thousands of Kashmiris whereas the security forces deny having their information and/or custody.

Military forces in Jammu and Kashmir operate under impunity and emergency powers granted to them by the central government. These powers allow the military to curtail civil liberties, creating further support for the insurgency.&lt;ref name="YardleyPower" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AI Press Release Feb 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2012/02/india-security-forces-cannot-claim-immunity-under-afspa-must-face-trial-violations/|title=India: Security forces cannot claim immunity under AFSPA, must face trial for violations|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=7 March 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423062142/https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2012/02/india-security-forces-cannot-claim-immunity-under-afspa-must-face-trial-violations/|archivedate=23 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] accused security forces of exploiting the [[Armed Forces Special Powers Act]] (AFSPA) that enables them to "hold prisoners without trial". The group argues that the law, which allows security to detain individuals for as many as two years "without presenting charges, violating prisoners’ human rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2011/03/28/amnesty-international-cites-human-rights-abuse-in-kashmir|title=Amnesty International Cites Human Rights Abuse in Kashmir|last=Huey|first=Caitlin|date=28 March 2011|publisher=Usnews.com|accessdate=2012-10-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430022351/http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2011/03/28/amnesty-international-cites-human-rights-abuse-in-kashmir|archivedate=30 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Army sources maintain that "any move to revoke AFSPA in Jammu and Kashmir would be detrimental to the security of the Valley and would provide a boost to the terrorists."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Army-opposes-Omars-plans-to-revoke-AFSPA-Report/articleshow/4197012.cms|title=Army opposes Omar's plans to revoke AFSPA: Report - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-05-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012072106/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Army-opposes-Omars-plans-to-revoke-AFSPA-Report/articleshow/4197012.cms|archivedate=12 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Chief of the Army Staff (India)|Indian Army Chief]] [[Vijay Kumar Singh|General V. K. Singh]] rejected the accusations that the action was not taken in the cases of human rights violations by Army personnel. On 24 October 2010, he has said that 104 Army personnel had been punished in Jammu and Kashmir in this regard, including 39 officers. He also said that 95% of the allegations of human rights abuses against Indian Army were proved to be false, of which he remarked, had apparently been made with the "ulterior motive of maligning the armed forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-104-armymen-punished-for-human-rights-violations-in-jk-gen-vk-singh-1457257|title=104 armymen punished for human rights violations in JK: Gen VK Singh {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=2010-10-24|work=dna|access-date=2017-04-24|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425121321/http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-104-armymen-punished-for-human-rights-violations-in-jk-gen-vk-singh-1457257|archivedate=25 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Human Rights Watch, the military courts in India, in general, were proved to be incompetent to deal with cases of serious human rights abuses and were responsible in covering up evidence and protecting the involved officers.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/about/projects/womrep/General-42.htm|title=Rape by Security Forces: The Pattern of Impunity|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hrw.org|access-date=2017-05-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012104533/https://www.hrw.org/legacy/about/projects/womrep/General-42.htm|archivedate=12 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International in its report in 2015, titled ''“Denied”-Failures in Accountability in Jammu and Kashmir'', says, "...with respect to investigations, an inquiry that is conducted by the same authority accused of the crime raises serious questions about the independence and impartiality of those proceedings”, adding that according to the international law, an independent authority that is not involved in the alleged violations has to investigate such crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kashmirreader.com/2016/09/03/96-complaints-against-army-rejected-by-goi-under-colonial-afspa-amnesty/|title=96% complaints against army rejected by GoI under ‘colonial’ AFSPA: Amnesty|last=Correspondent|first=Reader|date=2016-09-03|website=Kashmir Reader|access-date=2017-05-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804103846/http://kashmirreader.com/2016/09/03/96-complaints-against-army-rejected-by-goi-under-colonial-afspa-amnesty/|archivedate=4 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other reasons ===

==== Psychological ====
Psychologist Waheeda Khan, explaining the rebellious nature of the Kashmiris, says that because of the tense situations in the valley from the 1990s, the generation gap between parents and young generations has increased. Young generations tend to blame their parents for failing to do anything about the political situation. So they start experimenting with their own aggressive ways to show their curbed feelings and would go against any authority. A prominent psychiatrist of the valley, Margoob, described that children/teenagers are much more vulnerable to passionate actions and reactions, since the young minds are yet to completely develop psychological mechanisms. When they assume that they are "pushed against the wall", they get controlled by the emotions without bothering about the consequences. Also young people easily identify themselves with the "group" rather than with their individual identities. It leads to psychological distress which causes antisocial behaviour and aggressive attitude. Often, this situation gets worsened by the availability of weapons and people becoming familiar to violence after having exposed to conflict for so long. Waheeda Khan remarks, the major concern is that generations of children who are experiencing long-term violence in their lives, may reach adulthood perceiving that violence is a fair means of solving ethinic, religious, or political differences.{{sfn|Waheeda Khan, Conflict in Kashmir|2015|p=90, 91}}

====Economic====
High unemployment and lack of economic opportunities in Kashmir are also said to have intensified the struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-40008876|title=Indian award for Kashmir 'human shield' officer|last=|first=|date=2017-05-23|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-GB|quote=High unemployment and complaints of heavy-handed tactics by security forces battling street protesters and fighting insurgents have aggravated the problem.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523075335/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-40008876|archivedate=23 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesofindia.com/india/unemployment-a-reason-for-surge-in-jk-violence/articleshow/51849148.cms|title=Unemployment a reason for surge in J&amp;K violence? - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/Understanding-Kashmirs-stone-pelters/article16120870.ece|title=Understanding Kashmir's stone pelters|last=Parthasarathy|first=Malini|date=|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-05-24|language=en|quote=The protesters on the streets...(are) frustrated at the lack of employment and economic opportunities.

== Stone pelting ==
{{Main|Stone Pelting in Kashmir}}
Since the [[Amarnath land transfer controversy|2008 protests]] and [[2010 Kashmir unrest|2010 unrest]], the turmoil has taken a new dimension when people, particularly youngsters of the Kashmir valley have started pelting stones on security forces to express their aggression and protest for the loss of freedom. In turn they get attacked by the armed personnel with pellets, rubber bullets, sling shots and tear gas shells. This leads to eye-injuries and several other kind of injuries to many people. Security forces also face injuries, and sometimes get beaten up during these events. According to Waheeda Khan, most of the 'stone-pelters' are school and college going students. Large number of these people get arrested during these events for allegedly resorting to stone pelting, after which some of them are also tortured. According to political activist Mannan Bukhari, Kashmiris made stone, an easily accessible and defenseless weapon, their weapon of choice for protest.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvnb|Waheeda Khan, Conflict in Kashmir|2015|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=43ZJCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT44&amp;dq=kashmir+stone+pelting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixsdzKzsTTAhVGP48KHcMhDtkQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=kashmir%20stone%20pelting&amp;f=false|title=Kashmir - Scars of Pellet Gun: The Brutal Face of Suppression|last=Bukhari|first=Mannan|date=2015-07-28|publisher=Partridge Publishing|year=|isbn=9781482850062|location=|pages=44|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kashmiri senior journalist Parvaiz Bukhari remarked:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kashmirlife.net/summers-of-unrest-challenging-india-1089/|title=Summers of Unrest Challenging India|website=www.kashmirlife.net|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-04-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012061809/http://kashmirlife.net/summers-of-unrest-challenging-india-1089/|archivedate=12 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The summer of 2010 witnessed a convulsion in the world’s most militarized zone, the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, an unprecedented and deadly civil unrest that is beginning to change a few things on the ground. [...] Little known and relatively anonymous resistance activists emerged, organizing an unarmed agitation more fierce than the armed rebellion against Indian rule two decades earlier. And apparently aware of the post 9/11 world, young Kashmiris, children of the conflict, made stones and rocks a weapon of choice against government armed forces, side-stepping the tag of a terrorist movement linked with Pakistan. The unrest represents a conscious transition to an unarmed mass movement, one that poses a moral challenge to New Delhi’s military domination over the region.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Tactics ==

=== India ===
Over time the Indian government has increasingly relied on military presence to control the insurgency.&lt;ref name="EconomistGrim" /&gt;  The military has committed human rights violations.&lt;ref name="HRW96" /&gt; The government would often dissolve assemblies, arrest elected politicians and impose president's rule. The government also rigged elections in 1987.&lt;ref name="AltafElections" /&gt; In recent times there have been signs that the government is taking local elections more seriously.&lt;ref name="RamaDilemma" /&gt; The government has also funneled development aid to Kashmir and Kashmir has now become the biggest per capita receiver of Federal aid.&lt;ref name="SangThink" /&gt;

=== Pakistan ===
The Pakistani central government originally supported, trained and armed the insurgency in Kashmir,&lt;ref name="firstpost1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rediff1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indianexpress1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Afzal Guru’s confession: I helped them, took training in Pak|url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/WOR-TOP-afzal-guru---s-confession-i-helped-them-took-training-in-pak-4175799-NOR.html|accessdate=19 April 2015|publisher=DAILY BHASKAR|date=10 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402124224/http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/WOR-TOP-afzal-guru---s-confession-i-helped-them-took-training-in-pak-4175799-NOR.html|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes known as "ultras" (extremists),&lt;ref name="indianexpress2"&gt;{{cite news|author=Agencies |date=6 April 2012 |title=Attempts will be made to push ultras across LoC: Army |newspaper=Indian Express |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/attempts-will-be-made-to-push-ultras-across-loc-army/933432/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MSCjR4X4?url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/attempts-will-be-made-to-push-ultras-across-loc-army/933432/ |archivedate=7 January 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indiatimes1"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Press Trust of India]] |date=7 January 2014 |title=Militants, Army troopers exchange fire in Pulwama, none hurt |newspaper=Times of India |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Militants-Army-troopers-exchange-fire-in-Pulwama-none-hurt/articleshow/28522668.cms |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140107184652/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Militants-Army-troopers-exchange-fire-in-Pulwama-none-hurt/articleshow/28522668.cms |archivedate=7 January 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; however after groups linked to the Kashmiri insurgency twice attempted to assassinate president Pervez Musharraf, Musharraf decided to end support for such groups.&lt;ref name="KhanMilitants" /&gt; His successor, [[Asif Ali Zardari]] has continued the policy, calling insurgents in Kashmir "terrorists".&lt;ref name="StephensJob" /&gt;

But the Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] hasn't followed the lead of the government and has continued its support for insurgent groups in Kashmir&lt;ref name="StephensJob" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ColeObama" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RediffKashmir" /&gt; although Pakistani support for the insurgency has certainly waned.&lt;ref name="EconomistGrim" /&gt;

=== Insurgents ===
Since around 2000 the 'insurgency' has become far less violent and has instead taken on the form of protests and marches.&lt;ref name="ThottamValley" /&gt; Certain groups have also chosen to lay down their arms and look for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.&lt;ref name="GuptaKashmir" /&gt;

=== Groups ===
The different insurgent groups have different aims in Kashmir. Some want complete independence from both India and Pakistan, others want unification with Pakistan and still others just want greater autonomy from the Indian government.&lt;ref name="BBCFuture" /&gt;

A 2010 survey found that 43% in J&amp;K and 44% in [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir|AJK]] would favour complete independence from both India and Pakistan, with support for the independence movement unevenly distributed across the region.&lt;ref name="CHSurvey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-05-28/india/28318260_1_favoured-budgam-plebiscite|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140114082544/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-05-28/india/28318260_1_favoured-budgam-plebiscite|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 January 2014|title=Just 2% of people in J&amp;K want to join Pak: Survey|work=The Times of India|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identity ==
Over the last two years, the militant group, [[Lashkar-e-Toiba]] has split into two factions: ''Al Mansurin'' and ''Al Nasirin''. Another new group reported to have emerged is the "Save Kashmir Movement". [[Harkat-ul-Mujahideen]] (formerly known as [[Harkat-ul-Mujahideen|Harkat-ul-Ansar]]) and [[Lashkar-e-Toiba]] are believed to be operating from [[Muzaffarabad]], [[Azad Kashmir]] and [[Muridke]], Pakistan respectively. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Other less well known groups are the Freedom Force and Farzandan-e-Milat. A smaller group, [[Al-Badr (India)|Al-Badr]], has been active in Kashmir for many years and is still believed to be functioning. [[All Parties Hurriyat Conference]], an organisation that uses moderate means to press for the rights of the Kashmiris, is often considered as the ''mediator'' between New Delhi and insurgent groups. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=== Al-Qaeda ===
It is unclear if [[Al Qaeda]] has a presence in Jammu and Kashmir. [[Donald Rumsfeld]] suggested that they were active&lt;ref name="AbbasQaeda" /&gt; and in 2002 the [[Special Air Service|SAS]] hunted for [[Osama bin Laden]] in Jammu and Kashmir.&lt;ref name="SmithSAS" /&gt; Al Qaeda claims that it has established a base in Jammu and Kashmir.&lt;ref name="IHTKashmir" /&gt; However, there has been no evidence for any of these assertions.&lt;ref name="AbbasQaeda" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SmithSAS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IHTKashmir" /&gt; The Indian army also claims that there is no evidence of Al Qaeda presence in Jammu and Kashmir.&lt;ref name="HinduQaeda" /&gt; Al Qaeda has established bases in Pakistani administered Kashmir and some, including [[Robert Gates]] have suggested that they have helped to plan attacks in India.&lt;ref name="HinduQaeda" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DawnQaeda" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SmuckerQaeda" /&gt;

== Casualties ==
According to Sumantra Bose in his book, ''Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace'', around 40000 (Indian estimates) to 80000 ([[Hurriyat]] estimates) civilians, separatist guerilla fighters and Indian security personnel died from the time period of 1989 to 2002 in both [[Kashmir Valley]] and [[Jammu]] . More than 4600 security personnel, 13500 civilians and 15937 [[Terrorist|militants]] including 3000 from outside [[Jammu and Kashmir]] (mostly Pakistanis and some Afghans) were killed in this fourteen-year period. Also in this period, 55,538 incidents of violence were recorded. Indian forces engaged in counter insurgency operations captured around 40,000 firearms, 150,000 explosive devices, and over 6 million rounds of assorted ammunition.&lt;ref name="sbose"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bose | first = Sumantra | title = Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | url = https://www.questia.com/read/118148594/kashmir-roots-of-conflict-paths-to-peace | date = 2003 | page = 3 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171012061143/https://www.questia.com/read/118148594/kashmir-roots-of-conflict-paths-to-peace | archivedate = 12 October 2017 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society posits a figure of 70,000 deaths, most of them civilians killed by Indian forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kashmirobserver.net/2016/local-news/karadzic-prosecute-all-accused-hr-violations-kashmir-jkccs-4777|title=Like Karadzic, Prosecute All Accused of HR Violations in Kashmir: JKCCS|last=|first=|date=|work=Kashmir Observer|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016071013/https://kashmirobserver.net/2016/local-news/karadzic-prosecute-all-accused-hr-violations-kashmir-jkccs-4777|archivedate=16 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Isdal Woman''' ({{lang-no|Isdalskvinnen}}) is the name given to an unidentified woman who was found dead at Isdalen Valley in [[Bergen|Bergen, Norway]], on 29 November 1970. Considered one of Norway's most profound mysteries, the case has been the subject of intense speculation for many years.&lt;ref name=BT&gt;{{cite news|last=Tønder|first=Finn Bjørn|title=Viktig nyhet om Isdalskvinnen |trans-title=Important news about Isdal Woman |url=http://www.bt.no/nyheter/lokalt/Viktig-nyhet-om-Isdalskvinnen-2405382.html |date=26 November 2002 |accessdate=21 October 2012|newspaper=Bergens Tidende|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
[[File:Isdalen.JPG|thumb|left|Isdalen Valley, where the woman was discovered.]]
On the afternoon of 29 November 1970, a man and his two daughters were hiking in the foothills of the north face of [[Ulriken|Mount Ulriken]], in an area known as the Isdalen Valley. They found the partially-charred body of a woman, hidden among some rocks, in an area popularly known as "Death Valley". Also found (confirmed during the autopsy) were a dozen [[phenobarbital]] [[Hypnotic|sleeping pills]] (brand name Fenemal); an empty bottle of St. Hallvard likør (at times labelled St. Hallvard [[liqueur]]); two partially charred plastic water-carrying bottles; an almost fully burned plastic container; remnants of rubber boots; a scarf and an umbrella; a watch with two earrings and a ring. Beneath the body was a fur hat which was later found to have contained a small trace of petrol.&lt;ref name="Timeline - The Palace of the Ice Valley - Special"&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline - The Palace of the Ice Valley - Special|url=https://www.nrk.no/tidslinje---gaten-i-isdalen-1.13180269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forensic data ==
An [[autopsy]] concluded the woman died from poisoning by [[Fenemal]] and [[carbon monoxide]].&lt;ref name="Isdalen Mystery 2016" /&gt; Analysis of her [[blood]] showed that she had consumed at least 50 sleeping pills.&lt;ref name="futilitycloset.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futilitycloset.com/2014/01/03/the-isdal-woman/|title=The Isdal Woman – Futility Closet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her face had been burned and was unrecognisable. Her neck was bruised, possibly by a blow. 

Stable isotope analysis of her teeth in 2017 indicated that the woman had been born in about 1930 in or near [[Nuremberg]], Germany, but had moved to [[France]] or the region of the [[France–Germany border]] as a child.&lt;ref name="ageC14" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Major breakthrough' in Norway's 46-year-old Isdal woman mystery|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39978131|date=19 May 2017|accessdate=19 May 2017|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reinforced earlier analysis of her handwriting, which suggested that she had been educated in France or a neighbouring country.
A [[DNA]] profile was obtained in 2016 from the woman's teeth, and this suggested ancestral ties to western [[Continental Europe]].&lt;ref name="Isdalen Mystery 2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Isdalen Mystery|url=https://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/xl/the-isdalen-mystery-1.13249066|website=NRK|accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Analysis of the woman's teeth also indicated she had been to a [[dentist]] in [[East Asia]], [[Central Europe]], [[Southern Europe]] or [[South America]].&lt;ref name="NRK Dokumentar 2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Do you remember this woman?|url=https://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/do-you-remember-this-woman_-1.13215629|website=NRK|accessdate=13 May 2017|date=29 November 2016|quote=This is the description the Norwegian police sent to Interpol and police forces throughout Europe, North Africa and the Middle East: 'Approximately 25-30 years of age. Height 164 cm, slim with broad hips. Long brownish-black hair, small round face, brown eyes, small ears. The teeth showed many repairs, several of the molars had gold caps, and the dental work is of a kind practised in the Far East, Central or Southern Europe, and South America. Fourteen of the teeth are partly or completely root-filled. There is a marked partition between the two upper front teeth'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yndestad|first=Monika Nordland|title=Hær bæres Isdalskvinnen til sitt anonyme gravsted |trans-title=Here Isdal Woman is carried to her anonymous grave |url=http://www.ba.no/nyheter/krim/drap/article1511762.ece|accessdate=21 October 2012|newspaper=Bergensavisen |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Police immediately launched a full-scale investigation. Composite sketches, based on witness descriptions and analysis of her body, were published in the Norwegian media and circulated in many countries via [[INTERPOL]].

They found two suitcases belonging to the woman at an [[Norwegian State Railways|NSB]] railway station in Bergen. In the lining of one, police discovered 500 [[Deutsche Mark]]. Among other things, they found clothing (all identifying labels removed), a lotion [[Medical prescription|prescription]] (doctor's name and date removed), 130 [[Norwegian krone]]r, spoons similar to the one found melted at the Isdalen Valley site,&lt;ref name="Isdal Woman Case"&gt;{{cite web|title=Isdal Woman Case|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases-int/503ufnor.html|website=The Doe Network|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pair of sunglasses carrying partial fingerprints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gåten i Isdalen|url=https://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/xl/gaten-i-isdalen-1.12987220|website=nrk.no|ref=gii-doku}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some diary entries. Police later concluded the entries were coded dates and places the woman had visited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kalde spor fra Isdalen |trans-title=Cold trail from Isdalen |newspaper=A-magasinet |date=19 November 2010 |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; An unusual dress was found as well; from that, police determined the woman had a somewhat provocative style, marked by Italian taste.

An Italian photographer's postcard was found in the woman's luggage. When police spoke with him, he said he had given a similar woman a lift to [[Hotel Alexandra (Stryn, Norway/Leon)|Hotel Alexandra]] in [[Loen]]. He said he also had dinner with her. The woman told him that she was from a small town north of [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, and that she had six months to see Norway's most beautiful places. The police checked the woman the photographer named in South Africa - and she was not reported missing. Thus this line of inquiry went nowhere.

Police learned that the "Isdal Woman" had traveled around Norway and Europe with at least eight [[fake passport]]s. While authorities eventually concluded that she had committed [[suicide]],&lt;ref name=BT/&gt; others believe that there is evidence that she was [[murder|murdered]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/christopherhudspeth/the-mystery-of-the-isdal-woman-is-one-of-the-most|title=If You're Never Heard Of The Case Of The Isdal Woman, It's One Of The Most Odd Cases You'll Ever See|last=|first=|date=|website=BuzzFeed|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The last time she was seen alive was when she left room 407 of the Hotel Hordaheimen on 23 November 1970. She paid cash and then got into a taxi. The hotel staff described her as between the ages of 30 and 40, a smoker, about {{height|cm=164|precision=0}}  tall, with wide hips, small eyes, and a pleasing figure.{{cn|date=September 2018}} She mostly stayed in her room and seemed to be on guard.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The taxi driver who took her from the hotel to the station was never found. How she got to the isolated place where her body was discovered is also unknown. In 1991 a taxi driver wishing to remain anonymous said that after taking the unknown woman to the hotel, they were joined by another man before the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/xl/sporene-politiet-aldri-fant-ut-av-1.13149849|title=Sporene politiet aldri fant ut av|first=Ståle|last=Hansen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple investigations point to the possibility that she was a [[Espionage|spy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39369429|title=The mystery death haunting Norway for 46 years|last=Cheung|first=Helier|date=2017-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories ==
[[File:Agm119 penguin.png|thumb|Norwegian Penguin missile]]
Despite the significant police resources deployed, the unknown woman was never identified. Many questions remain unanswered, especially about the reasons for such an adventurous existence with so many different moves and identities.

A theory involving fake check trafficking was proposed by a retired police officer, but quickly abandoned.

The most frequently cited theory is that of espionage in the [[Cold War]] context of the time. The possession of nine fake passports seems indeed to imply a very professional organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/xl/the-isdalen-mystery-1.13249066|title=The Isdalen mystery|first=Ståle|last=Hansen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declassified records of the Norwegian National Defense bring disturbing coincidences: many of the stranger's movements seem to correspond to top secret trials of the Norwegian [[Penguin (missile)|Penguin]] missile. A fisherman even said to have recognized the unknown woman while observing military movements in Stavanger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/xl/her-er-den-hemmelige-isdals-mappen-1.13191844|title=Her er den hemmelige Isdals-mappen|first=Ståle|last=Hansen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the conclusion of the local police remains that of suicide by ingestion of sleeping pills. Given the doubts raised by this finding, the local police were also suspected of involvement in this case. Norway has also experienced other strange disappearances in the 1960s, close to military installations, which also evokes the track of international espionage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/xl/de-kom-til-norge-og-dode-1.13428134|title=De kom til Norge og døde|first=Ståle|last=Hansen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Witness descriptions and itinerary==
[[File:Møllendal kirkegård.JPG|thumb|Møllendal cemetery, where the "Isdal Woman" is buried]]
People who saw or met the woman said that she wore wigs (which was quite common practice in this period&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hair-and-makeup-artist.com/womens-1960s-hairstyles/|title=Women's 1960s Hairstyles: An Overview - Hair and Makeup Artist Handbook|date=12 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and spoke Flemish, German and broken English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norway makes international appeal to solve 46-year-old mystery|url=https://www.thelocal.no/20170515/norway-makes-international-appeal-to-solve-46-year-old-mystery|accessdate=1 July 2018|publisher=TheLocal}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had stayed at several hotels in Bergen, and repeatedly changed rooms after checking in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Slo bensin over seg og tende på |url=https://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/xl/_slo-bensin-over-seg-og-tende-pa_-1.13137579|accessdate=23 October 2016|publisher=NRK}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told [[hotel]] staff that she was a travelling saleswoman and [[antiquities]] dealer. At several places, she left a standing order: [[porridge]] with milk.

One witness said that she overheard the woman talking to a man in a Bergen hotel. According to the witness, the woman said, in {{lang-de|Ich komme bald}} ("I am coming soon").

The last hotel the Isdal Woman stayed at was the Hotel Hordaheimen (room 407, November 19–23). Staff told police that she was good-looking and roughly {{height|ft=5|in=4}} tall, with dark [[brown hair]] and small [[Eye_color#Brown|brown eyes]]. According to dental examination in 2017, she is estimated to have been around 40 years of age at the time of her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Isdal woman older than previously thought |url=https://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/xl/isdalskvinnen-eldre-enn-man-har-trodd-1.13822049|accessdate=1 July 2018|publisher=NRK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Hordaheimen guest told police that the Isdal Woman smoked South State [[cigarette|cigarettes]] (a Norwegian brand). Staff noted that the woman kept mainly to her room and seemed to be on guard. When she checked out of the Hordaheimen on 23 November, the Isdal Woman paid her bill in cash and requested a taxi. Her whereabouts between then and 29 November (when her body was found) are unknown.

On the 5th of February 1971 the Isdal Woman was given a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] burial, in an unmarked [[grave]], and in a zinc coffin to preserve her remains.

==Later developments==
In 2002, Tore Osland, son of the leading investigator, wrote the book "Isdalskvinnen, Operation Isptopsy."&lt;ref name="Isdalskvinnen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Isdalskvinnen|url=https://www.isdalskvinnen.no|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Unreliable source?|date=March 2018}}

In 2005, a Bergen resident who was 26 in 1970 told a local [[newspaper]] that after seeing the sketch circulated, he had suspected that the dead woman was the woman he had seen five days before the body was found, when he was hiking on the hillside at [[Fløyen]]. She was dressed lightly, for the city rather than a hike, and was with two men wearing coats who looked "southern". She seemed about to say something but they stopped her. He went to someone he knew at the police to report this, but was told to forget about it.&lt;ref name="Yndestad"&gt;{{cite news|last=Yndestad|first=Monica Nordland |title=Turgåer møtte isdalskvinnen |trans-title=Hiker met Isdal Woman |url=http://www.ba.no/nyheter/krim/drap/article1511766.ece|accessdate=22 May 2017 |newspaper=Bergensavisen|date=20 March 2005|language=Norwegian |quote=Glem henne, hun ble ekspedert. Saken blir aldri oppklart [Forget her, she's been seen to. The case won't ever be solved]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore neither his name nor his alleged sighting was recorded anywhere back then.

In 2016, [[NRK]] commissioned the American artist [[Stephen Missal]] to create six alternative sketches of the Isdal Woman, which were put before people who had seen her.&lt;ref name="New Sketches"&gt;{{cite news |first=Eirin |last=Aardal |url=https://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/xl/er-dette-isdalskvinna_-1.13137112 |title=Er dette Isdalskvinna? |trans-title=Is This Isdal Woman? |publisher=NRK |date=20 October 2016 |accessdate=22 May 2017 |language=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[NRK]] and the [[BBC]] published a podcast series titled [https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p060ms2h "Death in Ice Valley"], which included interviews with eyewitnesses and forensic scientists, whose findings were presented as suggesting that the Isdal Woman's birthplace may have been [[Southern Germany]] or the French-German border region, and that she was likely born in the 1930s or early 1940s. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Marit |last1=Higraff |first2=Brian |last2=McCarthy |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p060ms2h |title=Death in Ice Valley |publisher=BBC World Service |date=26 March 2018 |accessdate=1 November 2018 |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John F. Kennedy musical flyer.jpg|frame|The Theatrical Poster]]
'''''JFK: A Musical Drama''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with music by [[Will Holt]], and book and lyrics by Will Holt and Tom Sawyer. Based loosely on the life of [[John F. Kennedy]]. It premiered at the [[Olympia Theatre, Dublin]] on April 24th, 1997 and [[New York City]] in 1998.

The production was directed and choreographed by [[Larry Fuller]] and produced by [[Stewart F. Lane]]. The role of JFK was played by Maurice Clarke. It also starred [[Gary Raymond]], [[Brian DeSalvo]], [[Monica Ernesti]], [[Stella McCusker]] and [[Peter Vollebreght]].

The musical was music directed by Aaron Hagan and orchestrated by [[Peter Matz]]. A cast album with some of the original 1993 Goodspeed Opera House at Chester cast including Rita Gardner, Michael Brian, Claudia Rose Golde, and William Zeffiro was recorded in 2007.

Upon the early closure of the musical, [[Frank Kilfeather]] of the [[Irish Times]] quipped ''"Can you remember where you where, the night they said "JFK" had been shut?"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/1997/0429/97042900004.html Can you remember where you were, the night they said "JFK" had been shut? - Frank Kilfeather, ''Irish Times'', 29 April 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juliusz Słowacki Theatre''' in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], ({{lang-pl|Teatr im. Juliusza Słowackiego w Krakowie}}), erected in 1893, was modeled after some of the best European [[Baroque]] theatres such as the Paris Opera designed by Charles Garnier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.local-life.com/krakow/articles/krakow-slowacki-theatre|title=Cracow - Guide - Krakow Old Town - The Slowacki Theatre|website=www.local-life.com|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and named after Polish poet [[Juliusz Słowacki]] in 1909.&lt;ref name="culture.pl"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.culture.pl/en/culture/artykuly/in_te_slowackiego_krakow | title=Słowacki Theatre | publisher=www.culture.pl | accessdate=July 25, 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006060910/http://www.culture.pl/en/culture/artykuly/in_te_slowackiego_krakow | archivedate=October 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Designed by [[Jan Zawiejski]], the theatre was erected on Holy Ghost Square (''Plac Św. Ducha'') in place of the former 14th century church and monastery of [[religious order]] 'Duchacy' or [[Order of the Holy Ghost]] (hence the name of the square). The church had been converted into a residential building due to [[secularization]] of the Polish male branch of the [[Enclosed religious order|cloister]] in 1783. The city council of Kraków decided to demolish it in 1886 in order to make room for a new theatre. The church was dismantled in May 1892{{spaced ndash}}an event which caused much controversy, notably the [[Emotive (sociology)|emotive]] declaration of Polish painter [[Jan Matejko]], that he would never exhibit his paintings in Kraków again.

The new theatre opened on October 21, 1893. It was an exquisite example of the Polish [[Eclecticism|Eclectic]] architecture, the first building in Kraków designed for and equipped with electric light. Initially it was called Municipal Theatre (''Teatr Miejski''). Only in 1909 did it receive the name of Juliusz Słowacki, a Polish poet and playwright [[Romanticism in Poland|of Romanticism]].

Inauguration took place with a program consisting of excerpts from [[Aleksander Fredro]]'s ''Zemsta'', Juliusz Słowacki's ''[[Balladyna (drama)|Balladyna]]'' and [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s ''[[Konfederaci Barscy]]''. The theatre staged its first full-length production, Fredro's ''Śluby Panieńskie'', four days later.

During [[Nazi Germany]] occupation of Poland, the theatre was run by a German troupe. The last Polish play for the next 6 years was produced in Autumn 1939. The theatre reopened for Polish audience in February 1945.

Since March 27, 1976, the theatre is accompanied by the Small Stage housed in the former electric plant (designed in 1890s, to provide the theatre with its own electricity). In 2000 a third stage was added, the summertime Next to the Pump Stage. A fourth one (Stage in the Gate) opened on November 7, 2003.

===Directors===
The first director of the Theatre was Tadeusz Pawlikowski (1893–1899), followed by Józef Kotarbiński (1899–1905) and [[Ludwik Solski]] (1905–1913). Tadeusz Pawlikowski resumed this position in the years 1913-1915. Playwright [[Lucjan Rydel]] became the Theatre's director for one season during 1915-1916. Adam Grzymala-Siedlecki took that role in the years 1916-1918.

After [[World War I]], the theatre was directed by Teofil Trzciński (1918–1926), Zygmunt Nowakowski (1926–1929), once again Trzciński (1929–1932), Juliusz Osterwa (1932–1935) and Karol Frycz (1935–1939). Frycz and Osterwa became the directors again after [[World War II]] (Frycz from 1945–1946, and Osterwa in 1946-1947). The next directors were Bronisław Dąbrowski (1947–1950) and Henryk Szletyński (1950–1955). Bronisław Dąbrowski was once again appointed as director from 1955-1972. Krystyna Skuszanka and Jerzy Krasowski directed the theatre from 1972 to 1981. [[Andrzej Kijowski]]'s short period of directorship ended the same year with the imposition of [[martial law in Poland]]. Mikołaj Grabowski (1982–1985) was followed by Jan Paweł Gawlik (1985–1989), Jan Prochyra (1989–1990), Jerzy Goliński (1990–1992) and Bogdan Hussakowski (1992–1999). Current director of the theatre is Krzysztof Orzechowski.

==Cultural significance==
The Theatre became the birthplace of the theatrical concept of the [[Young Poland]] movement and was closely related to the rediscovery of Romantic drama as well as the premiere productions of plays by Polish national playwright [[Stanisław Wyspiański]].

The significance of the Polish Romantic tradition under the foreign occupation and especially Słowacki's legacy was reflected in the first festival of his plays organized there in 1909. It was at this time that the Theatre adopted the name of Słowacki and became known as Juliusz Słowacki Theatre.

{{Quote|text=The proposal of a theatre based on a synthesis of the visual arts, acting, music, light and drama is as natural as theatre itself. At the time, however, it was an [[avant-garde]] solution that challenged reigning canons.|sign=Diana Poskuta-Włodek|source=Culture.pl.&lt;ref name="culture.pl/Poskuta-Włodek"&gt;Diana Poskuta-Włodek, [http://www.culture.pl/web/english/theatre-full-page/-/eo_event_asset_publisher/Ny17/content/the-juliusz-slowacki-theatre-in-krakow-1 The Juliusz Slowacki Theatre in Kraków] (in) D.

[[File:Krakow 71.jpg|thumb|280px|Juliusz Słowacki Theatre, side view]]

At the Theatre, the audiences could witness actors such as Kazimierz Kamiński, [[Ludwik Solski]], Maksymilian Węgrzyn, Antonina Hoffman, Wanda Siemaszkowa, Stanisława Wysocka and [[Aleksander Zelwerowicz]]. Theatre artists like [[Juliusz Osterwa]] and Kazmierz Junosza-Stepowski began their careers at the Słowacki Theatre, and [[Helena Modrzejewska]] made numerous guest appearances. During the [[interwar period]], the theatre was overshadowed by the Warsaw theatre scene, but still it was considered to be one of the most important stages in Poland. In 1980 the Słowacki Theatre staged the world premiere of [[Pope John Paul II]] ''Our God's Brother'' (''{{lang|pl|Brat naszego boga}}''), a production whose significance was above all political.

[[File:Kiidk'yaas in 1984.jpg|thumb|right|''Kiidk'yaas'' in 1984]]

'''''Kiidk'yaas''''' (meaning "ancient tree" in the [[Haida language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kiidk-yaas-the-golden-spruce-2 | title = Kiidk'yaas, the Golden Spruce | accessdate = 2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;), also known as the '''Golden Spruce''', was a [[Sitka spruce]] [[tree]] (''Picea sitchensis'' 'Aurea') that grew on the banks of the [[Yakoun River]] on the [[Haida Gwaii]] archipelago, in [[British Columbia]] [[Canada]]. It had a rare genetic [[mutation]] that caused its needles to be golden in colour (rather than the usual green).  Kiidk'yaas was considered sacred by the [[Haida people]].

Kiidk'yaas was [[felling|felled]] in January 1997 by [[Grant Hadwin]] as an act of protest against the [[logging industry]].

Kiidk'yaas and its felling are the subject of [[John Vaillant]]'s 2005 book ''[[The Golden Spruce (book)|The Golden Spruce]]''.

==Kiidk'yaas in Haida mythology==
Kiidk'yaas features prominently in [[Haida people|Haida]] mythology.

The Kiidk'yaas story tells of a young boy who disrespected nature and thereby caused a terrible storm to descend on his village.  Only he and his grandfather survived the storm.  As they fled the village, the grandfather warned the boy not to look back.  The boy disobeyed, and was immediately turned into the Golden Spruce where he stood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://wiggersfurniture.blogspot.ca/2011/01/story-of-kiid-kiyaas-golden-spruce.html | title = The Story of K'iid K'iyaas (The Golden Spruce) | accessdate = 2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Felling==

In January 1997, 47-year-old unemployed [[forest engineer]] [[Grant Hadwin]] travelled to Haida Gwaii and purchased a [[chainsaw]] and other felling equipment.  Early on the morning of January 20, 1997 he swam across the freezing [[Yakoun River]] (with all of his equipment, in the middle of the night, in mid-winter) and made a series of strategic deep cuts in Kiidk'yaas.  The cuts were designed to leave Kiidk'yaas standing but weakened, so that it would be knocked over by the next strong winds.  The tree fell two days later.

After cutting down the tree, Hadwin left the islands for [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]].  He sent a [[fax]] to the [[news media|media]] and the [[Haida people|Haida nation]] claiming responsibility for the act, saying that he was motivated by "rage and hatred towards university trained professionals and their extremist supporters".&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;  The act outraged people throughout [[Canada]] and received extensive media coverage.  Hadwin was arrested, ordered to return to Haida Gwaii to stand trial, and released on [[bail]].

Hadwin planned to travel to his trial date by crossing the notoriously stormy and violent [[Hecate Strait]] (from [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]] to [[Masset, British Columbia|Masset]]) alone by [[kayak]] in mid-winter.  He departed Prince Rupert in February 1997 but never arrived at his trial.  What is believed to be Hadwin's broken kayak and effects were found on Mary Island in June 1997. Whether he had been murdered for his crime, accidentally drowned, or left his belongings behind and fled into the wilderness is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant, John, ''The Golden Spruce'', W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2005, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;  His fate remains unknown.

==Post-felling==
[[File:GoldenSpruceSapling.jpg|thumb|A sapling from Kiidk'yaas]]
In 1977 a group of botanists from the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC) visited Haida Gwaii to take [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of Kiidk'yaas.&lt;ref name="1977clipping"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://geog.tamu.edu/sarah/humangeog/tree.html | title = (Untitled) | last = Bednarz | first = Sarah | accessdate = 2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cuttings were [[grafting|grafted]] onto ordinary Sitka spruce, resulting in two golden saplings. The trees were grown in the [[UBC Botanical Garden and Centre for Plant Research]].  Upon hearing of the tree's destruction in 1997, the [[arboretum]] offered one of the two young trees to replace Kiidk'yaas. However, the sapling died in storage before it could be transported to Haida Gwaii.  The second sapling survives at UBC.&lt;ref name="saplingDied"&gt;Vaillant, John, ''The Golden Spruce'', W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2005, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

After Kiidk'yaas' felling, attempts were made to propagate a further 80 cuttings (with the permission of the [[Haida people]]) in order to increase the chances of a successful offspring surviving.&lt;ref name="saplingDied"/&gt;

The only wood harvested from the tree was used by [[Nova Scotia]] [[luthier]] George Rizsanyi and broadcaster [[Jowi Taylor]] as part of [[Six String Nation]], a guitar dedicated to [[Canadian history]].  Other pieces of the guitar include wood from [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s canoe paddle and [[Paul Henderson]]'s hockey stick.

'''''Mickey's Polo Team''''' is a 1936 American animated [[short film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] and released by [[United Artists]]. The cartoon features a game of [[polo]] played between four Disney characters, led by [[Mickey Mouse]], and four [[Caricature|cartoon versions]] of real-life movie stars. It was directed by [[David Hand (animator)|David Hand]] and was first released on January 4, 1936. The film was inspired by [[Walt Disney]]'s personal love of polo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Smith|first=Dave|authorlink=Dave Smith (archivist)|encyclopedia=[[Disney A to Z: The Official Encyclopedia]]|title=Mickey's Polo Team|edition=1st|year=1996|publisher=[[Hyperion Books|Hyperion]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=0-7868-8149-6|pages=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cartoon features cameos of many Disney characters from the ''[[List of Mickey Mouse cartoons|Mickey Mouse]]'' and ''[[Silly Symphonies|Silly Symphony]]'' film series, as well as several real-world 1930s entertainment figures.

==Plot==
[[Mickey Mouse]] is participating in a [[polo]] game, with a team that includes [[Goofy]], the [[Big Bad Wolf (Disney)|Big Bad Wolf]], and [[Donald Duck]], who is having trouble with his donkey. They are playing against [[Stan Laurel]], [[Oliver Hardy]], [[Harpo Marx]], and [[Charlie Chaplin]] (for which he is in his [[The Tramp|Tramp]] outfit). Actor [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]], who is serving as referee, throws the ball, which begins the game. First out is Oliver, who is knocked off his horse when the two teams fight to get the ball from the other. He is hit on the head with horseshoes while on the ground. The Big Bad Wolf takes the ball and manages to keep it ahead of the others but Charlie Chaplin soon steals the ball and hits it into one of the poles, using his cane to turn himself around to go in the other direction and keep up with the team. Meanwhile, Ollie is struggling to get back on his horse because of his overweight body. As Mickey hits the ball toward his home goal, Harpo Marx and his ostrich are forced to duck under the sand to avoid being hit. Ollie is finally able to get onto his horse but his weight causes the horse's body to sag in the middle.

In an attempt to make the horse stay up, Stan Laurel pulls Ollie's horse's tail out and ties it in a knot, which works. However, the horse refuses to get back in the game and no matter how hard Ollie tries to entice it, it stays in place. Stan tries to poke it with a needle to make it get going, but it takes off before he can do so, throwing Ollie off and having him get poked instead. In the game, the Big Bad Wolf takes the lead with the ball again, but loses his mallet in the process and uses his breath to make the ball go forward instead. However, [[Shirley Temple]] and The Three Little Pigs mock him for doing this and blow raspberries at him. He gets angry and pushes back by blowing the fence they are behind away and clouding them with dust, but the distraction causes him to lose his lead in the game. Donald Duck takes the lead and hits the ball, but Harpo Marx hits the ball back at him and the momentum behind the two to get the ball ends with them colliding.

Donald yells insults at him for knocking him off, but Harpo responds by punching him with boxers' mitts that he hides in his clothes, burns Donald with a blowtorch and uses a noisemaker to push him away, back to his donkey. The ball lands right next to him and he tries to hit it but the team takes it away. Frustrated, he tries to get his donkey to move but it sits on him, laughing. It then kicks him into the ground where the ball lands on his tail and he is trampled by the other players (including Ollie, who finally manages to get back in the game). Donald throws a tantrum and accidentally swallows the ball, causing the teams to chase after him to get it out. Harpo hits him first, using the head of his ostrich, and the Big Bad Wolf manages to briefly get the ball out by hitting him but it bounces back inside Donald. All of the players from both teams try to hit him which eventually causes him to dig into the sand to escape. Donald tries to hide inside a pole but the teams continue to try to hit him out. Finally, he rips the pole off its base and leads both teams toward referee Jack Holt, which causes everyone to collide and make the horses end up riding their owners and continue the game in that way.

The "'''Miracle of Chile'''" was a term used by economist [[Milton Friedman]] to describe the reorientation of the [[economy of Chile|Chilean economy]] in the 1980s and the effects of the economic policies applied by a large group of Chilean economists who collectively came to be known as the [[Chicago Boys]], having studied at the [[University of Chicago]] where Friedman taught.  He said the "Chilean economy did very well, but more importantly, in the end the central government, the [[military junta]], was replaced by a [[Chilean transition to democracy|democratic society]]. So the really important thing about the Chilean business is that free markets did work their way in bringing about a free society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commanding Heights: Milton Friedman|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitext/int_miltonfriedman.html#10|publisher=PBS|accessdate=December 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The junta to which Friedman refers was a [[Military government of Chile (1973–90)|military government]] that came to power in a [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|1973 coup d'état]], which came to an end in 1990 after a democratic [[Chilean national plebiscite, 1988|1988 plebiscite]] removed [[Augusto Pinochet]] from the presidency.

In the early 1970s, Chile experienced [[chronic inflation]], reaching highs of 140 percent per annum, under [[socialist]] President [[Salvador Allende]], whose government suffered heavy [[economic sanctions]] from [[Nixon]]'s administration.  This resulted in a lack of [[foreign-exchange reserves]] and falling GDP.&lt;ref name="brauchle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thirdworldtraveler.com/NSA/CIA_Allende_LS.html |title=The CIA's Campaign Against Salvador Allende |author=[[Morton Halperin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economic reforms implemented by the Chicago Boys had three main objectives: [[economic liberalization]], [[privatization]] of state-owned companies, and stabilization of [[inflation]]. The first reforms were implemented in three rounds – 1975–82, 1985–present, the first of which led to the [[crisis of 1982]].&lt;ref name="brauchle"/&gt; The reforms were continued and strengthened after 1990 by the post-Pinochet [[centrism|center]] government of [[Patricio Aylwin]]'s [[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian Democrats]].&lt;ref name="Thomas M. Leonard p. 322"&gt;Thomas M. Leonard. ''Encyclopedia Of The Developing World.'' Routledge. {{ISBN|1-57958-388-1}} p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; However, the center-left government of [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]] also made a commitment to poverty reduction. In 1988, 48% of Chileans lived below the poverty line. By 2000 this had been reduced to 20%. A 2004 World Bank report attributed 60% of Chile's 1990's poverty reduction to economic growth, and claimed that government programs aimed at poverty alleviation accounted for the rest.&lt;ref&gt;http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/292491468743165841/pdf/308060CL0poverty01see0also0307591.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hernán Büchi]], Minister of Finance under Pinochet between 1985 and 1989, wrote a book detailing the implementation process of the economic reforms during his tenure. Successive governments have continued these policies. In 2002 Chile signed an association agreement with the [[European Union]] (comprising [[free trade]] and political and cultural agreements), in 2003, an extensive free trade agreement with the [[United States]], and in 2004 with [[South Korea]], expecting a boom in import and export of local produce and becoming a regional trade-hub. Continuing the coalition's free-trade strategy, in August 2006 President Bachelet promulgated a [[free trade agreement]] with the [[People's Republic of China]] (signed under the previous administration of [[Ricardo Lagos]]), the first Chinese free-trade agreement with a [[Latin America]]n nation; similar deals with Japan and India were promulgated in August 2007. In 2010, Chile was the first nation in South America to win membership in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, an organization restricted to the world's richest countries.

[[#Performance on economic and social indicators|Some economists]] (such as Nobel laureate [[Amartya Sen]]) have argued that the experience of Chile in this period indicates a ''failure'' of the economic liberalism posited by thinkers such as Friedman, claiming that there was little net economic growth from 1975 to 1982 (during the so-called "pure [[Monetarism|Monetarist]] experiment"). After the catastrophic [[Crisis of 1982|banking crisis of 1982]] the state controlled more of the economy than it had under the previous socialist regime, and sustained economic growth only came after the later reforms that privatized the economy, while social indicators remained poor.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7c2a7a48-2030-11db-9913-0000779e2340.html#axzz1qL9FWsgp&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=October 2018}} Pinochet's dictatorship made the unpopular economic reorientation possible by repressing opposition to it. Rather than a triumph of the free market, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] economist [[Javier Santiso]] described this reorientation as "combining neo-liberal sutures and interventionist cures".&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=XY0OR_n8MncC&amp;pg=PA101&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of sustained growth, the Chilean government had "cooled its [[neo-liberal]] ideological fever" and "controlled its exposure to world financial markets and maintained its efficient copper company in public hands".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f9d1f780-1fe7-11db-9913-0000779e2340|title=How Chile cooled its ideological fever|date=2006-07-30|website=Financial Times|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1972, Chile's inflation was at 150%.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; According to Hernán Büchi, several factors such as expropriations, price controls, and protectionism caused these economic problems.&lt;ref name=Buchi&gt;{{cite journal |last=Büchi  |first=Hernán |authorlink=Hernán Büchi |date=18 September 2006 |title=How Chile successfully transformed its economy |journal=Backgrounder |volume=1958 |pages=1–10 |publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]] |location=Washington, DC |url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2006/09/How-Chile-Successfully-Transformed-Its-Economy |accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Bank increased the money supply to pay for the increasing deficit. Büchi states that this increase was the primary cause for inflation.&lt;ref name=Buchi/&gt;

United States government documents report an antagonistic foreign economic policy toward the Allende government that was "articulated at the highest levels" during this time.&lt;ref name=us-senate-1975/&gt;{{rp|33}} Shortly after Salvador Allende was elected president, but before he assumed office, then-CIA-director [[Richard Helms]] met with  [[Richard Nixon|President Richard Nixon]] and discussed the situation in Chile. Helms' notes from his September 15, 1970 meeting contain the indication: "Make the economy scream." A week later [[Edward M. Korry|Ambassador Edward Korry]] reported telling outgoing Chilean president [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]], through his Defense Minister, that "not a nut or bolt would be allowed to reach Chile under Allende." By late 1972, the Chilean Ministry of the Economy estimated that almost one-third of the diesel trucks at [[Chuquicamata Copper Mine]], 30 percent of the privately owned city buses, 21 percent of all taxis, and 33 percent of state-owned buses in Chile could not operate because of the lack of spare parts or tires. In overall terms, the value of United States machinery and transport equipment exported to Chile by U.S. firms declined from $153 million in 1970 to $110 million in 1971.&lt;ref name=us-senate-1975/&gt;{{rp|33}}

Immediately following the [[Chilean coup of 1973]], [[Augusto Pinochet]] was made aware of a confidential economic plan known as ''[[El ladrillo]]''&lt;ref name=LADRILLO&gt;{{es}}[http://www.cepchile.cl/dms/lang_1/cat_794_inicio.html ''El Ladrillo: Bases de la Política Económica del Gobierno Militar Chileno.''

The plan had been quietly prepared in May 1973 &lt;ref name=HERENCIA&gt;{{es}} [http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_3192000/3192145.stm Villaroel, Gilberto.

The document contained the backbone of what would later on become the Chilean economic policy.&lt;ref name="HERENCIA"/&gt; According to the 1975 report of a [[Senate Intelligence Committee|United States Senate Intelligence Committee]] investigation, the Chilean economic plan was prepared in collaboration with the CIA.&lt;ref name=us-senate-1975&gt;{{cite book|title=Covert Action in Chile 1963–1973|year=1975|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|location=Washington, DC|url=http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/pdfs94th/94chile.pdf|author=Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, United States Senate|accessdate=14 July 2013|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130706111810/http%3A//www.intelligence.senate.gov/pdfs94th/94chile.pdf|archivedate=2013-07-06|quote=Another goal, achieved in part through work done at the opposition research organization before the coup, was to help the new government organize and implement new policies.

The plan recommended a set of economic reforms that included [[deregulation]] and [[privatization]]. Among other reforms, they made the central bank independent, cut tariffs, privatized the state-controlled [[pension]] system,&lt;ref name=PENSION&gt;[http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/econ/ib23_chile.pdf RIX, Sara E., Ph.D. ''Chile’s Experience With The Privatization Of Social Security.'' AARP Public Policy Institute, August 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; state industries, and banks, and reduced taxes. Pinochet's stated aim was to "make Chile not a nation of [[proletariat|proletarians]], but a nation of [[entrepreneur]]s".&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/63821.stm | work=BBC News | title=Pinochet's rule: Repression and economic success | date=2001-01-07 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reforms==
The first reforms were implemented in three rounds – 1974–1983, 1985, and 1990.&lt;ref name="brauchle"/&gt;

The government welcomed [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] and eliminated protectionist [[trade barrier]]s, forcing Chilean businesses to compete with [[import]]s on an equal footing, or else go out of business. The main copper company, [[Codelco]], remained in government hands due to the [[Chilean nationalization of copper|nationalization of copper]] completed by [[Salvador Allende]], however, private companies were allowed to explore and develop new mines. Copper resources were, however, declared "inalienable" by the [[Constitution of Chile|1980 Constitution]].

Minister of Finance [[Sergio de Castro (economist)|Sergio de Castro]], departing from Friedman's support for free floating exchange rates, decided on a [[Fixed exchange-rate system|pegged exchange rate]] of 39 pesos per dollar in June 1979, under the rationale of bringing Chile's rampant [[inflation]] to heel. The result,&lt;ref name="The Political Economy of Unilateral Trade Liberalization"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/sebastian.edwards/W6510.pdf | work=UCLA  | title=The Political Economy of Unilateral Trade Liberalization | year=1990 | accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, was that a serious balance-of-trade problem arose. Since [[Chilean peso]] [[inflation]] continued to outpace U.S. dollar inflation, every year Chilean buying power of foreign goods increased. When the bubble finally burst in late 1982, Chile slid into a severe [[recession]] that lasted more than two years.

This deep economic recession of 1982–1983 was Chile's second in eight years. (In 1975, when GDP fell by 13 percent, industrial production plunged by 27 percent and unemployment increased to 20 percent). Additionally, inflation reached 375 percent in 1974—the highest rate in the world and almost twice the top level under Allende.&lt;ref&gt;Constable and Valenzuela, "A Nation of Enemies," p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1982–1983 recession, real economic output declined by 19%, with most of the recovery and subsequent growth taking place after Pinochet left office,&lt;ref name=DEPRESSION&gt;[http://multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1983/04/bello.html Bello, Walden, and Kelly, John.

International Finance, The Multinational Monitor, April 1983, Volume 4, Number 4]&lt;/ref&gt; when market-oriented economic policies were additionally strengthened.&lt;ref name="Thomas M. Leonard p. 322"/&gt;

In his Memoirs ("Chapter 24: Chile", 1998), Milton Friedman criticized De Castro and the fixed exchange rate.&lt;ref name="Two Lucky People"&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6l0_vQ1zpI8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=To+lucky+people+milton+friedman&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iEefTfftKtOzhAeDgYnxBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sergio%20de%20castro&amp;f=false | work=[[University of Chicago Press]]  | title=Two Lucky People | year=1998 | accessdate=2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1985, with [[Hernán Büchi]] as Minister of Finance, the focus of economic policies shifted toward financial solvency and economic growth. Exports grew rapidly and unemployment went down, however, poverty still represented a significant problem, with 45 percent of Chile's population below the [[poverty threshold|poverty line]] in 1987. Büchi wrote about his experience during this period in his book ''La transformación económica de Chile: el modelo del progreso''. In 1990, the newly elected [[Patricio Aylwin]] government undertook a program of "growth with equity", emphasizing both continued economic liberalization and poverty reduction. Between 1990 and 2000, poverty was reduced from 40 percent of the population to 20 percent. 60 percent of this reduction can be attributed to GDP growth, with the remaining 40 percent attributable social policies.&lt;ref name=DEPRESSION2&gt;[http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/reducingpoverty/case/24/summary/Chile%20Summary.pdf ''Chile: Successes and Failures in Poverty Eradication.'' World Bank]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free trade agreements===
Successive Chilean governments have actively pursued trade-liberalizing agreements. The process began in the 1970s, when Pinochet cut tariffs on imports to 10%. Prior to that, Chile had been one of the most protectionist economies in the world, ranking 71 out 72 in a 1975 [[Cato Institute]] and [[Fraser Institute]] annual report.&lt;ref name="Cato-Fraser"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fraseramerica.org/commerce.web/product_files/EconomicFreedomoftheWorld1975-1995.pdf | title=Economic Freedom of the World 1970–1995 | work=[[Cato Institute]] and [[Fraser Institute]], 1996 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314142857/http://fraseramerica.org/commerce.web/product_files/economicfreedomoftheworld1975-1995.pdf | archivedate=2016-03-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, Chile signed [[free trade agreement]]s (FTA) with Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Chile also concluded preferential trade agreements with Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. An association agreement with Mercosur—Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay—went into effect in October 1996. Continuing its export-oriented development strategy, Chile completed landmark free trade agreements in 2002 with the European Union and South Korea. Chile, as a member of the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) organization, is seeking to boost commercial ties to Asian markets. To that end, it has signed trade agreements in recent years with New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei, India, China, and most recently Japan. In 2007, Chile held trade negotiations with Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, and China. In 2008, Chile hopes to conclude an FTA with Australia, and finalize an expanded agreement (covering trade in services and investment) with China. The P4 (Chile, Singapore, New Zealand, and Brunei) also plan to expand ties through adding a finance and investment chapter to the existing P4 agreement. Chile's trade talks with Malaysia and Thailand are also scheduled to continue in 2008.&lt;ref name="USDoS"&gt;{{Cite web

== Performance on economic and social indicators ==
[[File:Unemployment Chile.png|thumb|Unemployment in Chile and South America (1980–1990).]]
[[Amartya Sen]], in his book ''Hunger and Public Action'', examines the performance of Chile in various economic and social indicators. He finds, from a survey of the literature on the field:

{{quote|The so-called "monetarist experiment" which lasted until 1982 in its pure form, has been the object of much controversy, but few have claimed it to be a success...The most conspicuous feature of the post 1973 period is that of considerable instability...no firm and consistent upward trend (to say the least).}}

According to [[Ricardo Ffrench-Davis]] the unnecessary radicalism of the shock therapy in the 1970s caused mass unemployment, purchasing power losses, extreme inequalities in the distribution of income and severe socio-economic damage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]], Helmut Wittelsbürger, Albrecht von Hoff, [http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_4084-544-1-30.pdf?040415182627 Chile's Way to the Social Market Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]] data the percentage of Chilean population living in poverty rose from 17% in 1969 to 45% in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Ffrench-Davis, ''Economic Reforms in Chile: From Dictatorship to Democracy'', [[University of Michigan Press]], 2002, {{ISBN|978-0472112326}}, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

Wages decreased by 8%.&lt;ref name="Petras and Vieux 1998 57-72"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Petras | first1 = James | last2 = Vieux | first2 = Steve | title = The Chilean "economic miracle": an empirical critique | journal = [[Critical Sociology (journal)|Critical Sociology]] | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 57–72 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/089692059001700203 | date = July 1990 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/089692059001700203 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family allowances in 1989 were 28% of what they had been in 1970 and the budgets for education, health and housing had dropped by over 20% on average&lt;ref name="Petras and Vieux 1998 57-72"/&gt;

Nobel laureate and economist Gary Becker states that "Chile's annual growth in per capita real income from 1985 to 1996 averaged a remarkable 5 percent, far above the rest of Latin America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Becker |first=Gary S. |authorlink=Gary Becker |editor1-first=Peter |editor1-last=Robinson |year=1997 |title=What Latin America Owes to the "Chicago Boys" |journal=Hoover Digest |volume= |issue=4 |issn=1088-5161 |url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/7743 |accessdate=3 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724040917/http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/7743 |archivedate=24 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the economy has averaged 3% annual growth in GDP.&lt;ref name="WDI"&gt;World Bank. (April 2010). Washington, DC: World Bank. Statistics retrieved 1 October 2010 from [http://data.worldbank.org World Development Indicators database].&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments were very positive with regards to infant mortality and life expectancy—infant mortality rate fell so much that Chile achieved the lowest level of infant mortality in Latin America in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Economic Reforms in Chile: From Dictatorship to Democracy |last=French-Davis |first=Ricardo |year= |publisher=U Michigan P |location=Ann Arbor, MI |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Infant mortality]] rate in Chile fell from 76.1 per 1000 to 22.6 per 1000 from 1970 to 1985.&lt;ref name=WDI/&gt; In 1988, the military government passed a law making all abortion illegal, and the law remains in place today.

However, Sen claims that this improvement was not because of "free-market" policies but because of active public and state intervention. Chile had a very long tradition of public action for the improvement of childcare, which were largely maintained after the Pinochet coup:

{{quote| ... there is little disagreement as to what caused the observed improvement in the area of child health and nutrition...It would be hard to attribute the impressively steady decline in infant mortality ... (despite several major economic recessions) ... to anything else than the maintenance of extensive public support measures}}

==Milton Friedman==
Milton Friedman gave some lectures advocating free market economic policies at the [[Universidad Católica de Chile]]. In 1975, two years after the coup, he met with Pinochet for 45 minutes, where the general "indicated very little indeed about his own or the government's feeling" and the president asked Friedman to write him a letter laying out what he thought Chile's economic policies should be, which he also did.&lt;ref name=REASON&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/118494.html Doherty, Brian. ''The Life and Times of Milton Friedman: Remembering the 20th century’s most influential libertarian.'' Reason Magazine, March 2007 Print Edition]  Friedman's 21 April 1975 letter may be found in Milton and Rose Friedman's ''Two Lucky People'' and in an [http://www.cb.cl/newcbcl/Estudios/DetalleE.asp?Id=1297 online Chilean newspaper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031071137/http://www.cb.cl/newcbcl/Estudios/DetalleE.asp?Id=1297 |date=2007-10-31 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; To stop inflation, Friedman proposed reduction of government deficits that had increased in the past years and a flat commitment by government that after six months it will no longer finance government spending by creating money. He proposed relief of cases of real hardship among poorest classes.&lt;ref name="brauchle"/&gt; In October 1975 the New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis declared that "the Chilean junta's economic policy is based on the ideas of Milton Friedman…and his Chicago School".&lt;ref name=REASON/&gt;

Friedman has wondered why some have attacked him for giving a lecture in Chile: "I must say, it's such a wonderful example of a double standard, because I had spent time in Yugoslavia, which was a communist country. I later gave a series of lectures in China. When I came back from communist China, I wrote a letter to the Stanford Daily newspaper in which I said, 'It's curious. I gave exactly the same lectures in China that I gave in Chile. I have had many demonstrations against me for what I said in Chile. Nobody has made any objections to what I said in China. How come?'" He noted that his visit was unrelated to the political side of the regime and that, during his visit to Chile, he even stated that following his economic liberalization advice would help bring political freedom and the downfall of the regime.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;

Commenting on his statement about the "Miracle", Friedman says that "the emphasis of that talk was that free markets would undermine political centralization and political control."&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ufd_reformliberty_full.html|title=Up for Debate: Reform Without Liberty: Chile's Ambiguous Legacy|last=Friedman|first=Milton |date=10 January 2000|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman stated that "The real miracle in Chile was not that those economic reforms worked so well, but because that's what Adam Smith said they would do. Chile is by all odds the best economic success story in Latin America today. The real miracle is that a military junta was willing to let them do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Milton |authorlink=Milton Friedman |editor1-first=Milton |editor1-last=Friedman |editor2-first=Thomas Stephen |editor2-last=Szasz |year=1992 |title=The Drug War as a Socialist Enterprise |journal=Friedman &amp; Szasz on Liberty and Drugs: Essays on the Free Market and Prohibition |publisher=Drug Policy Foundation |location=Washington, DC |url=http://www.druglibrary.org/special/friedman/socialist.htm |accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman said the "Chilean economy did very well, but more important, in the end the central government, the military junta, was replaced by a democratic society. So the really important thing about the Chilean business is that free markets did work their way in bringing about a free society."&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;

According to the Chilean scholars Javier Martínez and Alvaro Díaz it is a fallacy that the return to democracy in Chile was the result of free market reforms. Contrary to that argument the return of democracy required the defeat of the Pinochet regime. The essential contribution came from profound mass rebellions and finally old party elites using institutional mechanisms to bring back democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Javier Martínez, Alvaro Díaz, ''Chile, the Great Transformation''.

The show is a dramatization of the life of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] beginning from the age of 17 and culminating with his death in 1791 at the age of 35. It uses both original pop-rock compositions as well as pre-existing music composed by Mozart.

The musical premiered on 22 September 2009 at the [[Palais des Sports de Paris]], where it continued until 3 January 2010. From 4 February 2010 until 3 July 2010, it went on tour in [[France]], [[Belgium]] and [[Switzerland]]. It returned to Paris between 9 November 2010 and 9 January 2011. A second tour began on 4 February 2011, and the production closed on 10 July 2011 at the [[Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy]]. It was directed by [[Olivier Dahan]], choreographed by Dan Stewart and produced by Attia and [[Albert Cohen (producer)|Albert Cohen]].

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
The show opens with the accession of [[Hieronymus von Colloredo-Mannsfeld]] to the archbishop of Salzburg. Unlike the previous ruler, Colloredo is discouraging of the arts, which does not bode well for the Mozart family, who work for him. When [[Leopold Mozart]] requests leave to tour with his seventeen-year-old son and musical prodigy, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang]], Colloredo refuses and suggests Leopold and Wolfgang quit if they are dissatisfied. Leopold and his daughter, Wolfgang's older sister, [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]], bemoan the state of [[Salzburg]] and its subservient people (''Penser l'Impossible''). Wolfgang appears, tumbling out from under the skirts of several women he's been chasing, and proceeds to be told exactly what Colloredo told Leopold: His leave has been denied.

Wolfgang insists that he'll leave Salzburg alone if he has to, as Leopold must stay behind because they can't afford to be without work. Instead, Leopold sends Wolfgang's mother, [[Anna Maria Mozart|Anna Maria]], with him, as well as a warning: to find work fast, because a musician without a patron is no one. Anna Maria and Wolfgang set out for [[Mannheim]], unaware that Colloredo has already sent word ahead to the Prince to assure that Wolfgang will not find work with him.

The show moves ahead to an inn in Mannheim (''La chanson de l'aubergiste''), where Wolfgang enters with several finished commissions. After sharing his dream of writing a grand opera in German, he is ridiculed by several of the people in the bar who remind him that all operas are written in Italian. Wolfgang rejects their comments (''Le Trublion'') and a fight breaks out, during which both he and his mother flee before being arrested by the police. A local copyist meets them, already aware of Wolfgang's musical prestige, and offers to copy all of his compositions free and help him distribute them for a small condition – coming to visit his family.

The copyist is Fridolin Weber—Cecilia's husband—and they intend to have Wolfgang help them prepare their daughter, [[Aloysia Weber|Aloysia]], for a ball for the [[Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange|Princess of Orange]] to boost her fame. Anna Maria and Wolfgang visit the Webers at their home, where Wolfgang is introduced to [[Sophie Weber|Sophie]], [[Josepha Weber|Josepha]], and [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze]]. Upon the appearance of Aloysia (''Bim Bam Boum''), Wolfgang falls head over heels and forgoes his other commissions to help her prepare for her showcase to the Princess. He and the other members of the Weber family are unaware that Constanze has already started to fall in love with the young composer (''Ah! Vous dirais-je maman'').

Anna Maria, seeing that her son is prepared to throw away his musical career over his love of Aloysia, writes home to Leopold in the hopes that he will be able to snap Wolfgang out of his enamored state. She attempts to do this by telling Wolfgang that his commissions have been dropped and he's been rejected for employment, but Wolfgang insists that Aloysia is his future and displays no worry.

At the ball, Wolfgang and Aloysia display their respective musical talents, while Fridolin and Cecila attempt to get the Princess of Orange to take an interest in their daughter. While Wolfgang discusses music with the Princess, Aloysia discovers Constanze's jealousy over her relationship with Wolfgang (''Six pieds sous terre''). Wolfgang returns to announce that Aloysia will, indeed, be employed with the Princess of Orange and seems prepared to dedicate his life to her when Anna Maria arrives with a letter from Leopold (''J'accuse mon père''). He instructs Wolfgang to go to Paris to find work, and only then may he return to Aloysia. Aloysia, who intended to work with Wolfgang to bolster her success, proclaims that she hates him in response to Wolfgang's confession of love (something that Wolfgang does not hear).

After arriving in Paris, Wolfgang attempts to distribute his music and find a job (''[[Tatoue-moi]]''), but finds that Paris's doors have closed to him as well. When his mother suddenly falls ill and passes away (''la Procession''), he is left alone and jobless. In this state he imagines a grand and mocking display (''la Mascarade'') before Aloysia appears again. Still in love with her, he tells her that he has written an aria for her, which she ignores. She tells him that she is involved in the opera now, and far too busy for him. With lingering hatred she mocks his mourning clothes, seeming unaffected by the death of his mother, and when Wolfgang confesses that he wants to marry her she tells him that she is engaged to the actor [[Joseph Lange]].

Realizing how alone he is, and that all doors have closed to him, Wolfgang reflects on the humiliation, betrayal, and suffering he has gone through (''Je dors sur des roses''). Seeming defeated by his losses and hopelessness, Wolfgang rejects everyone who has attempted to bring him down and decides he will believe in his old dreams and aspirations, regardless of who or what stands in his way.

===Act II===
Wolfgang has returned to Salzburg under the service of Colloredo and is preparing to leave for [[Vienna]] with the archbishop to pay homage to the newly crowned [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. He tells his father that he plans to make a new life for himself in Vienna, which his father scoffs at, reminding him that his previous carelessness resulted in the death of his mother. He instructs Wolfgang to do as the archbishop tells him and return to Salzburg when he's done, but Wolfgang insists that he'll do what he has to as it's his life, and his music.

After leaving the company of his father, he is confronted by Colloredo, who reiterates his father's message of doing as he's told. When Wolfgang attempts to reason with him, Colloredo will hear nothing of it and tells him to go join the other servants – who proceed to mock him alongside a clown-like representation of his own doubt (''Comédie-tragédie''). The badgering mounts to a crescendo and he informs Colloredo that he quits and he is free to do as he pleases from now on. He proceeds to pass out his music throughout all of Vienna, where it is well received, and he finally begins to make a name for himself (''Place je passe'').

The scene moves to [[Antonio Salieri]], walking with Rosenberg, the Steward to Emperor Joseph II, and [[Gottlieb Stephanie]], a librettist who has recently finished his piece ''[[The Abduction from the Seraglio]]''. Rosenberg tells Salieri of the newcomer, Wolfgang, and his aspirations of composing a German opera, which Rosenberg then proceeds to mock for its lack of eloquence. Upon the appearance of the Emperor, Rosenberg attempts to discourage him from choosing Wolfgang as the composer for his commission on the basis of his desire to use German instead of the more traditional Italian.

Rosenberg explains that Wolfgang insists on writing in nothing other than German, though the idea of an opera in Vienna's native language appeals to the Emperor. He asks for the opinion of Salieri, already a well-known composer of the court, who appears to agree with the idea that Wolfgang is foolish, but also concedes that he is infinitely talented. In the end, Joseph decides that Mozart will do the music for their opera, much to the glee of Stephanie and the disdain of Rosenberg.

At the height of his dispute with Colloredo, Wolfgang takes up board with the Webers, who have moved to Vienna after the death of Fridolin and are taking in boarders to make ends meet. It is here he is re-introduced to Constanze, who has apparently decided to give up on love as she puts far too much into her relationships and is left heartbroken when they don't work out (''Si je défaille''). While Josepha and Sophie are excited to see him again, Cecilia is less than pleased with how he left Aloysia. Though she happily tells him that Aloysia's now married, doing well, and expecting a child. She also tells him that she doesn't want Wolfgang getting any ideas about her other daughters (or her, for that matter). After she leaves, Josepha and Sophie bombard him with questions about his new-found success in Vienna until Constanze intervenes and leads him to his room to get some rest.

Moving ahead, it has come time for Salieri and Rosenberg to check on the progress Wolfgang has made with his opera. When they arrive, Monsieur Stephanie attempts dissuade them, but they press on anyway and discover that Wolfgang is distracted from his work, instead chasing Constanze and demanding a kiss. Rosenberg is appalled by the display while Monsieur Stephanie attempts to get Wolfgang's attention. Wolfgang ignores him, and the diva, [[Caterina Cavalieri|La Cavalieri]], goes so far so to tease the latter with a kiss when she attempts to get him to focus.

It is ultimately Salieri who gets his attention with a simple recitation of his name. He explains that they are there on behalf of the Emperor and, by what they've seen, he will be disappointed. Annoyed at the treatment, Wolfgang demands to know how they can judge without hearing a single note, to which Rosenberg replies that there are too many notes. After a brief argument, Rosenberg tells Salieri that they're leaving and exits. Salieri, believing Wolfgang's behavior was a display to prevent them from discovering how little he's achieved, commends him for the clever plot. He remarks that he hopes Wolfgang's apparent confidence isn't a front for a lack of real talent.

However, before he can go, Wolfgang passes him his sheet music, saying that he won't need it as he begins to conduct. Salieri stays behind to listen, and is overcome by the beauty of Wolfgang's work and the skill he displays (''Le bien qui fait mal''). Startled and unnerved by the immeasurable talent, Salieri tells Wolfgang that if he remembers his place, all will be well between them. Salieri leaves and, pleased with his victory, Wolfgang returns to his game with Constanze. Unfortunately for the young lovers, Cecilia catches them and explains that she has had an agreement written up (a "promesse de mariage," in French, or "promise of marriage"): If Wolfgang does not marry Constanze within three years, he will have to pay Cecilia three-hundred florins. With no way out, Wolfgang signs the agreement despite knowing his father will not approve, and Constanze, upset with her mother's trap, runs off.

Back in Salzburg, Nannerl reads the news to her father that Wolfgang is doing well in Vienna and has a promising career of fame and fortune ahead of him. Leopold, however, is distraught over his son's request to marry Constanze. Despite Nannerl's suggestion of letting them be happy, and her insistence that Constanze seems sincere, Leopold is unmoved. She relates to Constanze, understanding her love for Wolfgang, and in Vienna Constanze reiterates this fact. Wolfgang, unable to believe that Constanze had anything to do with Cecilia's trap for him, confronts Constanze about it. Constanze insists that she didn't know about it and that she loves him of her own accord, so when Wolfgang tells her that isn't enough she rips it up the stolen contract. Now confident in their love, Wolfgang asks her to marry him and the two are wed (''Les solos sous les draps'').

After the ceremony, Rosenberg explains his growing disdain for not only Wolfgang's work, but also for Salieri's nonchalant treatment of it. He mocks Salieri's calm demeanor, as well as his disregard for how successful Wolfgang seems to be in Vienna, unaware that he is being watched by the very person he's ridiculing. Despite his disapproval, he admits to a few decent parts, beginning to sing the overture as one of them. After a short dance, Salieri makes himself known, startling Rosenberg greatly in the process, and proceeds to mimic Rosenberg's previous exaggerated display of his behavior. When asked if he really enjoys Wolfgang's music that much, Rosenberg denies it and explains that he was actually cursing in rage. He also tells Salieri that he plans to have friends of his sit in front of the Emperor at the opera's premiere to boo and hiss it. Salieri hesitates, but ultimately tells him to go ahead with the plan.

After the success of ''The Abduction from the Seraglio'', Wolfgang enjoys a celebration with his friends and wife where they mock Salieri and Rosenberg's attempts at upsetting the show. It is here that Wolfgang is approached by the well-known librettist, [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], who expresses interest in working with him. He presents Wolfgang with the work he had in mind, but Wolfgang refuses, instead proposing ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', a controversial drama by [[Beaumarchais]]. Da Ponte initially refuses, wary of the trouble it could cause, but is swayed when Wolfgang explains that he associates not with radical politics, but the triumph of Figaro as a free man. Da Ponte agrees, and they begin work.

At the rehearsal several months later, Joseph is frustrated to find that his opera has no music, and Wolfgang explains that Rosenberg has crippled his finale by declaring that the use of ballet has been forbidden by the Emperor. Joseph replies that he will simply change the old custom. He instructs Salieri to fix the problem, and Salieri tells Wolfgang to recommence the rehearsal with musical accompaniment.

Frustrated by Salieri's compliance, Rosenberg confronts him and rebuffs the idea that Salieri was getting them out of the mess Rosenberg nearly got them in. Still feeling that Salieri doesn't understand, he is surprised to find that Salieri actually understands very well: The monarchy will never approve of ''The Marriage of Figaro'', and it will be Wolfgang's undoing. He instructs Rosenberg to spread rumors and discord throughout the salons and cast, to bribe them if need be, before sending him off.

However, as Rosenberg exits, Salieri is conflicted about his actions, acknowledging again that Wolfgang's music is sublime. He laments his inability to compare with Wolfgang's talent despite dedicating himself to his music day and night, and, driven nearly to madness with jealousy and impending guilt, Salieri attempts to commit suicide (''l'Assasymphonie''). He fails to do so, however, and ultimately lives to see the fruition of his plans.

As friends of Wolfgang, including Constanze and Aloysia, are celebrating the success ''The Marriage of Figaro'' Rosenberg appears to tell them that, at the order of the Emperor, the opera has been banned in Vienna. This begins a downward spiral for Wolfgang, starting with his distraction while he and Da Ponte attempt to recover from the failure of Figaro with a new opera, ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', due to his father being ill. Unable to leave due to his work, Wolfgang is unable to be in Salzburg with Nannerl when Leopold passes away (''Dors mon ange'').

Later, a mysterious, masked figure appears when Wolfgang is in dire need of money, commissioning him on behalf of an unnamed connoisseur. The commission is for a requiem mass and Wolfgang is paid 100 [[ducats]] upfront with a promise of more when he finishes. The mysterious figure leaves, telling him to work with the greatest possible care and while Constanze believes this will solve their financial problems, Wolfgang worries of something far more serious: he believes the man has come from the afterlife to signal the end.

In another part of Vienna, a party has gathered to celebrate Salieri obtaining the title of choirmaster of the Imperial Chapel as well to as mock Wolfgang's latest opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''. The only one to stand up for Wolfgang is Da Ponte, who quickly leaves in disgust at their display. Although he has achieved everything he wanted, Salieri is bitter about the victory over Wolfgang and spiteful towards himself, knowing it was obtained through underhanded means (''Victime de ma victoire''). He realizes that despite winning, he has still lost.

Wolfgang, impoverished and ill, attempts to keep working even as his adversaries continue to openly berate and insult him. While working with his student, [[Franz Xaver Süssmayr|Süssmayr]], to complete his requiem, Wolfgang collapses and is ushered to bed by both Süssmayr and Constanze. His condition continues to worsen and he struggles to get out of bed when Salieri visits, having heard of Wolfgang's illness and now wishing to reconcile what he'd done. Though Constanze tries to get him to leave, Wolfgang insists on getting from his sickbed to speak with him.

He confides in Salieri that he will not finish his requiem and he knows that he is dying. When Constanze becomes upset and tries to call a doctor, he tells her that he only wishes to see Süssmayr, and that everything needed for finishing the requiem is on the desk. Constanze leaves in tears, and Wolfgang realizes how quickly life passes, just as Salieri realizes that the fear and anguish he felt are unimportant, as was the fleeting desire to outdo Wolfgang. They agree to meet each other again, in a place where their rivalry and offenses mean nothing anymore (''Vivre à en crever''). The musical ends with Wolfgang's death and ascension.

''[[Le Figaro]]'' praised the lighting and certain "innovations" in the staging, but also noted "the mediocre sound, an inconsistent libretto and uneven casting," stating that [[Mikelangelo Loconte|Mikelangelo Loconte's]] performance at Mozart was at once over-the top and "disembodied."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=lefigaro.fr |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/musique/2009/10/14/03006-20091014ARTFIG00046-mozart-l-opera-rock-.php |title=Le Figaro - Musique : Mozart,, l'opéra rock |publisher=Lefigaro.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Le Point]]'' also praised the lighting but deplored the "insipid melodies" and a "mediocrity" which the actors were unable to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/guide-sorties/2009-10-06/opera-rock-c-est-mozart-qu-on-assassine/2017/0/383398 |title=C'est Mozart qu'on assassine !, actualité Sortir : Le Point |publisher=Lepoint.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[France Soir]]'' described the show as "lacking genius and impertinence," weighed down by "a disjointed first act," "simpering" female characters and a "fidgety" Mozart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francesoir.fr/spectacle/2009/10/03/mozart-opera-rock-spectacle.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318033730/http://www.francesoir.fr/spectacle/2009/10/03/mozart-opera-rock-spectacle.html |archivedate=2010-03-18 |title=Francesoir |publisher=Francesoir.fr |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[['L'Express]]'' noted the "stylized scenes" and "hurried narrative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/scene/comedie-musicale/l-opera-rock-mozart-fait-flop_795577.html |title=L'opéra rock Mozart fait flop - L'EXPRESS |publisher=Lexpress.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine ''[[Têtu]]'' referred to the musical as "glittering, sugared like a meringue," extremely amusing but lacking noteworthy vocal skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tetu.com/actualites/culture/mozart-lopera-rock-un-rockeur-nomme-wolfgang-16014 |title=ÂŤMozart lâ€™opĂŠra RockÂť: un rockeur nommĂŠ Wolfgang - TĂŞtu |publisher=Tetu.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407064530/http://www.tetu.com/actualites/culture/mozart-lopera-rock-un-rockeur-nomme-wolfgang-16014 |archivedate=7 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the magazine ''Première'' stated that the show was a success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectacles.premiere.fr/pariscope/Theatre/Salle-de Spectacle/Spectacle/Mozart-L-Opera-Rock/(affichage)/press]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thierry Quinson of regardencoulisse.com, despite qualifications regarding the sound and the weak narrative of the second act, asserted that the project marked "a veritable evolution in the grand musicals of the last few years: the songs are better written, less formulaic and syrupy, a better-constructed narrative leaving more room for acting and choreography which is less invasive and systematic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regardencoulisse.com/mozart-lopera-rock/ |title=Mozart l’Opéra rock |publisher=Regardencoulisse.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Final Tour''' was a [[concert tour]] by [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Mötley Crüe]]. It had been announced as the band's final tour. [[Alice Cooper]] was announced as the opening act for the tour. The first leg of the tour began on July 2, 2014 in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] and concluded on November 22, 2014 in [[Spokane, Washington]]. The band further announced more dates for the second and final leg of the tour, which started February 11, 2015 in [[Kobe|Kobe, Japan]], and ended with three concerts at [[Staples Center]] in the band's hometown of [[Los Angeles]] on December 28, 30 and 31, 2015. The Tour was kicked off by a drum solo by Producer Joe of the FreeBeer &amp; Hotwings show.

== Background and development ==
On January 28, 2014, Mötley Crüe held a press conference at Beacher's Madhouse Theater in [[Hollywood]], where they announced a final tour with [[Alice Cooper]] as the opening act, and later on added [[New York City, New York|New York City]]-based band The Raskins as a second opening act for the first leg of the tour. The band became the first to sign a binding legal document known as a "cessation of touring" contract, preventing them from touring beyond the year 2015 under the name Mötley Crüe. The first leg of the Final Tour began on July 2, 2014 in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] and ended on November 22, 2014 in [[Spokane, Washington]].

In January 2015, the band announced that the Final Tour would keep going through the year of 2015, beginning with a handful of international dates in Japan, Australia, Europe and [[Rock in Rio]] for their only date in South America on the tour, followed by 34 more dates in North America to end the year and the tour. Even more North American dates however were later added in April 2015. Then a couple months later in June while in London preparing to perform at three different festivals across Europe, Mötley Crüe and Alice Cooper announced a full set of European dates, with the shows set to take place in November 2015. On July 16, 2015, the band set out on their second North American leg of the Final Tour, beginning with two sold-out nights in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], with the first of the two shows being recorded for an upcoming live album to be released sometime after the tour concludes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/motley-crue/2015/alaska-airlines-center-anchorage-ak-33f6dc35.html |title=Mötley Crüe Concert Setlist at Alaska Airlines Center, Anchorage on July 16, 2015 |website=Setlist.fm |date= |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; They brought along New York City-based band ''The Cringe'' as a second opening act for most of the second North American leg of the tour. Drummer [[Tommy Lee]] was forced to miss a handful of shows during October 2015 due to a flare up of [[tendinitis]] in his wrist. Alice Cooper's drummer [[Glen Sobel]] filled in for Lee on drums until he was able to return. Lee was however able to perform the piano parts in the band's hit song ''Home, Sweet, Home'' during the encore at each of the shows he missed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/tommy-lee-injury/ |title=Tommy Lee Forced to Miss Another MOtley CrUe Concert |website=Ultimateclassicrock.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band's final shows were held in different cities throughout the southwest region of the U.S. where the band often played as they were starting out in the early 1980s, leading up to the finales, including a performance in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] where lead vocalist [[Vince Neil]] has most recently been residing, and eventually ended with three nights at the [[Staples Center]] in the band's hometown of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] on December 28, 30 and 31st of 2015. Rumors of an intimate encore performance taking place at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] immediately following the band's New Year's Eve performance at Staples Center was dismissed by Mötley Crüe bassist [[Nikki Sixx]] in an April 2015 interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/nikki-sixx-on-motley-crue-playing-final-show-at-whisky-it-sounds-romantic-but-is-not-a-very-good-idea/ |title=Nikki Sixx On MÖtley CrÜe Playing Final Show At Whisky: 'It Sounds Romantic' But Is 'Not A Very Good Idea' |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=2015-04-20 |accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Set list ==
The set list was shortened by two songs from the first to the second leg of the tour, no longer playing songs "[[On with the Show (Mötley Crüe song)|On With the Show]]" and "[[Too Fast for Love (song)|Too Fast for Love]]". However "[[Louder Than Hell (Mötley Crüe song)|Louder Than Hell]]" was then added. The opening song was changed from "[[Saints of Los Angeles]]" to "[[Girls, Girls, Girls (Mötley Crüe song)|Girls, Girls, Girls]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wccbcharlotte.com/news/featuregallery/Alice-Cooper-and-Motley-Crue-at-PNC--PHOTOS-272007481.html |title=Alice Cooper and Mötley Crüe at PNC |author=Caryn Little |work=[[WCCB]] |date=August 20, 2014 |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1679">'''Nalapanima''' is a [[musical play]] (Geeti Natak)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shivashankar.org&lt;/ref&gt; describing patriotism of a Nepalese soldier during [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] at the [[Battle of Nalapani]] in 1814 AD,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nepalarmy.mil.np/history1.php&lt;/ref&gt; fought under the command of [[Balbhadra Kunwar]]. A wounded Nepalese soldier sought help from the British camp. He was grateful for the humaniterian help from the British but defied an offer to join British army ([[Gurkha War]]). 

The Drama was staged at the Rastriya Nachghar ([[Nepal]]). Lyrics were written by Bala Krishna ‘Sama’ and music composed by [[Shiva Shankar]]. After few years the drama was re-edited by Deepak Jangam and staged again. The songs of the album comprise distinctive blending of Nepalese folk styles and modern light touch.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.murchunga.net/Shiva_Shankar_Nalapanima/&lt;/ref&gt; The album also contains some unique duet songs sung by [[Narayan Gopal]] and his mentor Manik Ratna.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ekantipur.com/nepal/article/?id=1481&lt;/ref&gt;

==Songs==
# Piyo..., piyo:   ([[Narayan Gopal]] and Manik Ratna)
# Ke har khai Ayewu:  ([[Shiva Shankar]] and Narayan Gopal)
# Chora naro: (Kamala Shrestha)
# Haye mero pritam: (Kamala Shrestha)
# Awu awau relimai: (Manik Ratna)
# Ama timilai: (Narayan Gopal)
# Chomoluma shikhara:  (Shiva Shankar and Kamala Shrestha)
# Agalagi nibhawunu paryo: (Manik Ratna)
# Aye.. Ayen: (Manik Ratna)
# Najawu murkha bhai: (Narayan Gopal)
# Jana dewu aba: (Manik Ratna)
# Huncha huncha: (Narayan Gopal and Manik Ratna)

The '''Noël Coward Theatre''', formerly known as the '''Albery Theatre''', is a [[West End theatre]] on St. Martin's Lane in the [[City of Westminster]], London. It opened on 12 March 1903 as the '''New Theatre''' and was built by [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Sir Charles Wyndham]] behind [[Wyndham's Theatre]] which was completed in 1899. The building was designed by architect [[W. G. R. Sprague]] with an exterior in the [[classicism|classical]] style and an interior in the [[Rococo]] style.

In 1973 it was renamed the '''Albery Theatre''' in tribute to Sir [[Bronson Albery]] who had presided as its manager for many years. Since September 2005, the theatre has been owned by Delfont-Mackintosh Ltd. It underwent major refurbishment in 2006, and was renamed the '''Noël Coward Theatre''' when it re-opened for the London premiere of ''[[Avenue Q]]'' on 1 June 2006. [[Noël Coward]], one of Britain's greatest playwrights and actors, appeared in his own play, ''I'll Leave It To You'', at the then New Theatre in 1920, the first West End production of one of his plays.

The theatre seats 872 patrons on four levels. The building is now a Grade II [[Listed structure]].

==Notable productions==
After opening in 1903 with a production of ''Rosemary'' starring Charles Wyndham and his wife, Mary Moore (3 July 1861 – 6 April 1931), the Noël Coward Theatre has hosted a number productions. ''I'll Leave it to You'', in 1920, was Coward's first play. [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Saint Joan (play)|St. Joan]]'' with an acclaimed performance by actress [[Sybil Thorndike]] ran in 1924. 
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Gielgud Hamlet.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[John Gielgud]] directed and played the title role in a legendary production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' at the New Theatre in 1934.]] --&gt;

The 1930s saw the greatest commercial success of [[John Gielgud]]'s career, ''[[Richard of Bordeaux]]'' (1933). Gielgud followed up this triumph with a legendary production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in which he both played the title role and directed a company that included [[Jessica Tandy]], [[Jack Hawkins]] and a young [[Alec Guinness]] in one of his first professional roles as Osric. Gielgud also appeared with [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Peggy Ashcroft]] and [[Edith Evans]] in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. With [[the Blitz]] came the destruction of the theatres that were home to the [[Old Vic]] and [[Sadler's Wells]] Theatre Companies. Both companies made the New Theatre home until their respective theatres were rebuilt in the 1950s. One of the most successful shows to play the New Theatre opened 30 June 1960. It was [[Lionel Bart]]'s ''[[Oliver!]]'', which ran for 2,618 performances.

A 1970 [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] production of [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''[[London Assurance]]'', directed by [[Ronald Eyre]], with [[Donald Sinden]] as Sir Harcourt Courtly, (for which he received the 1975 [[Drama Desk Special Award]])&lt;ref name="Who 1981"&gt;Who's Who in the Theatre, 17th edition (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Rees]] as Charles, [[Judi Dench]] as Grace and [[Dinsdale Landen]] as Dazzle, transferred to the New Theatre in 1972 for a year, prior to its 1974 run in New York.

In 1981, ''[[Children of a Lesser God (play)|Children of a Lesser God]]'' won [[Olivier Award]]s for Best New Play and for actors [[Trevor Eve]] and Elizabeth Quinn. Among some of the 1980s productions is the 1994 revival of [[Turgenev]]'s ''[[A Month in the Country (play)|A Month in the Country]]'' starring [[Helen Mirren]] and [[John Hurt]].

In the 2000s the theatre has played host to several Shakespeare productions including a production of ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' set in India with an entirely Asian cast. The production played to packed houses and only closed as the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] themselves had exclusive rights to perform their annual London season of Tragedies there. Between December 2004 and April 2005, they presented ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Romeo &amp; Juliet]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'' and a brand new production of Euripides' ''[[Hecuba]]'' starring [[Vanessa Redgrave]].

On 8 June 2005, [[Dion Boucicault]]'s Victorian melodrama ''[[The Shaughraun]]'' opened; however, its success at the [[Dublin]] [[Gate Theatre]] was not repeated in London and it closed on 30 July. A dark period of around three months followed before the theatre was transferred to the ownership of Delfont Mackintosh Limited and reopened in October 2005 with [[The Right Size]]'s new production ''[[Ducktastic!]]''. Once again this failed to live up to expectations and closed just three weeks after opening on 19 November 2005. A short Christmas season of [[Patrick Stewart]]'s one-man version of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' played from 6 to 31 December 2005, before the theatre hosted the [[Edinburgh International Festival]] hit drama ''[[Blackbird (play)|Blackbird]]'' starring [[Roger Allam]]. The award-winning play Enron (directed by Rupert Goold, starring Samuel West and Tim Pigott-Smith) transferred here after a sellout run at the Royal Court. The European premiere of the Broadway hit, ''[[Avenue Q]]'', started previewing on 2 June 2006 and had its opening night on 28 June 2006, finally closing on 28 March 2009 prior to transferring to the [[Gielgud Theatre]].

Following a production of ''[[Deathtrap (play)|Deathtrap]]'', directed by [[Matthew Warchus]] and starring [[Simon Russell Beale]] and [[Jonathan Groff]], the theatre became the home of jukebox musical ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]'' in February 2011.

The '''Pat Day Mile Stakes''' is an American Grade 3 [[Thoroughbred horse race]] held on [[Kentucky Derby]] day run at [[Churchill Downs]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] for three-year-olds willing to race one mile on the dirt. 
The current purse is $250,000 for the event.

==History==

===Race name===
Originally, the event was known as the '''Derby Trial Stakes''' and was held one week before the [[Kentucky Derby]]. It was first run in 1924 and every year since, with the exception of 1928.

The race name was given similar to races in Britain which preceded the Epsom Derby such as
the Investec Derby Trial (now [[Blue Riband Trial Stakes]] and [[Lingfield Derby Trial]] and in Australia, the Geelong Derby Trail Stakes (now known as the ''Geelong Classic'').

In 2015, this race was renamed to the '''Pat Day Mile Stakes''' (in honor of the Hall of Fame jockey, [[Pat Day]]) and moved to the undercard of Kentucky Derby day. Its purse was increased from $150,000 to $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/90001/churchill-moves-derby-trial-now-pat-day-mile Moving and renaming of the Derby Trial]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the purse was raised to $250,000.

From 2010 through 2012, it had been named the '''Cliff's Edge Derby Trial'''.&lt;ref name="April 28, 2012"&gt;[http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/race/USA/CD/2012/4/28/8/the-cliffs-edge-derby-trial-s April 28, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distance and class===
The distance was reduced between 1977 and 1981 to 7 furlongs. And once again the distance from 2007 to 2009 was {{frac|7|1|2}} furlongs.  The Derby Trial Stakes was an ungraded event from 2006 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bloodhorse.com/article/48193.htm Derby Trial Stakes upgraded to Grade III status for 2009 - bloodhorse.com] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712022542/http://news.bloodhorse.com/article/48193.htm |date=2012-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Winners of the Trial and Derby===
Four trainers have won the Derby Trial and the Kentucky Derby with the same horse. The feat was accomplished by Hanley Webb in 1924 with [[Black Gold (horse)|Black Gold]] and by [[Ben A. Jones]] who did it twice, first with the great [[Citation (horse)|Citation]] in 1948 and then with [[Hill Gail]] in 1952. [[Eddie Hayward]] won both in 1953 with [[Dark Star (horse)|Dark Star]] and in 1958 [[Horace A. Jones|Jimmy Jones]], son of Ben, became the fourth and last to do it when he won the two races with [[Tim Tam (horse)|Tim Tam]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=E7ZjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WYEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6097,7485604&amp;dq=eddie-hayward+dark+star&amp;hl=en The Vindicator (Youngstown, Ohio) – April 28, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; Since Tim Tam, the gradual trend in training has been toward giving Derby contenders fewer prep races and more time between them.  This practice has all but eliminated the Trial as a legitimate Derby prep race.  Even the 1982 decision to move it from the Tuesday before the Derby to the Saturday before didn't help.

However, the three weeks between the Trial and the 1 3/16ths-mile Preakness in [[Baltimore]] is perfect.  In recent years, the Trial has sent the Preakness such horses as [[Key to the Mint]] (1972), No More Flowers (1987), Houston (1989), Honor Grades (1991), [[Alydeed]] (1992), [[Cherokee Run]] (1993), Numerous (1994), Our Gatsby (1995), Black Cash (1998), Patience Game (1999), Sir Shackleton (2004), Flying First Class (2007), [[Macho Again]] (2008), and Pleasant Prince (2010).

Although none of those Trial horses won the Preakness, Alydeed, Cherokee Run and Macho Again finished second at [[Pimlico|Pimlico Race Course]] and [[Key to the Mint]] finished third. And two of trainer [[Woody Stephens]]' Trial winners [[Caveat (horse)|Caveat]] in 1983 and [[Creme Fraiche (horse)|Creme Fraiche]] in '85 went on to win the [[Belmont Stakes]] (GI).  Additionally, the 2008 Belmont Stakes was won by [[Da'Tara]], trained by [[Nick Zito]], who finished in fifth place in the 2008 Derby Trial Stakes.

Calumet Farm had three horses that finished second in the Trial. In 1941, Whirlaway finished second to Blue Pair in the Trial, but then roared back to win the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]]. In 1949, [[Ponder (horse)|Ponder]] was second to Olympia in the Trial, but came back five days later to take the Derby by three lengths over [[Capot]].

In 1957, Middleground finished second in the Trial to Black George on a muddy track, but won the Kentucky Derby later on a fast track.

And then there was the ill-fated Gen. Duke in 1957.  He came to Churchill Downs touted as a potential superstar, but finished second to Federal Hill in the Trial. Then, the morning of the Derby, Gen. Duke was scratched because of a foot injury suffered in the Trial.

In 1967, Barb's Delight became the last Trial horse to have a significant impact on the Derby, finishing second by a length to longshot [[Proud Clarion]].  Don't Get Mad finished fourth in the Derby in 2005.

The last horse to win the Saturday before the Derby and then win the roses was [[Cannonade]] in 1974.  But the race he won was the now-defunct 7f Stepping Stone Purse, not the Derby Trial.

===Losers of the Trial and winners of the Derby===
Several Kentucky Derby winners failed to win the Trial, but bounced back to win the "Run for the Roses." Most notable of those were Calumet Farm's [[Iron Liege]], who finished fifth in the Trial and returned to defeat a Kentucky Derby field that included champions [[Gallant Man]], [[Round Table (horse)|Round Table]] and [[Bold Ruler]] and is generally considered to be the greatest field in Derby history.  [[King Ranch]]'s [[Assault (horse)|Assault]] finished fourth in the Trial, but returned to win the Derby and sweep the Triple Crown.  In 1941, Triple Crown winner [[Whirlaway]] finished second in the Derby Trial, but returned to sweep the Derby, [[Preakness Stakes]] and [[Belmont Stakes]].

[[File:percy-toplis.jpg|thumb|Percy Toplis in military uniform]]
'''Francis Percy Toplis''' (20 August 1896&amp;nbsp;– 6 June 1920) was a British [[criminal]] and [[imposter]] active during and after the [[First World War]]. Before the war he was imprisoned for attempted rape. During the war he served as a private in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]], but regularly posed as an officer while on leave, wearing a monocle. After the war he became notorious following the murder of a taxi driver and the wounding of a police officer who attempted to apprehend him. The manhunt was major news at the time. He was tracked down and killed in a gunfight with police.

In 1978 a book was published which claimed that he had a big part in the [[Étaples Mutiny]] from 9–12 September 1917, as "The Monocled Mutineer". The authors suggested that he was pursued by the political establishment in a vendetta and may have been innocent of the murder. The book was dramatised by the BBC in 1986 as ''[[The Monocled Mutineer]]'', creating considerable controversy.

Critics say that there is no evidence he was present and official records show that Toplis's unit was en route to [[India]] during the Étaples mutiny. No evidence exists to show that Toplis was absent from his unit; neither is there evidence that Toplis ever went to India and may only have got as far as [[Malta]]. It is now believed highly unlikely that he returned to Europe in time to participate in the mutiny.

==Birth and Youth==
[[File:HMP Lincoln.jpg|thumb|[[HMP Lincoln|Lincoln Prison]] where Toplis served his sentence 1912–1914]]
Toplis was born at Sanforth Street, [[Chesterfield]], [[Derbyshire]] and christened on 25 September 1896 at Skegby.&lt;ref name=aboutderbyshire&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.aboutderbyshire.co.uk/cms/people/percy-toplis-the-monocled.shtml | title=Percy Toplis - The Monocled Mutineer. | website=Tom Bates | date=31 May 2007 | last=Bates | first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, Herbert and Rejoice Elizabeth ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Webster), were unable to support him and he was raised by his grandparents.

He was educated at South Normanton [[Elementary School]], where he was reportedly an unruly bully who was frequently [[corporal punishment|caned]].&lt;ref name=aboutderbyshire /&gt; In March 1908, aged 11, he was [[birched]] for acquiring two suits using false pretences. His grandparents were no longer able to control him and the court released him to his aunt, Annie Webster. Toplis left school in 1910 aged 13, and became a blacksmith's [[apprentice]] at the Blackwell [[colliery]], but after a poor attendance record and an argument with the pit manager he took to an itinerant life in [[Scotland]]. In 1911 he was sentenced to ten days imprisonment in [[Dumfries]] for the non-payment of two train tickets. He returned to England and in 1912, aged 15, he was sentenced to two years [[hard labour]] for the attempted [[rape]] of a 15-year-old girl at [[Mansfield]], serving sentence in [[Lincoln (HM Prison)|Lincoln Prison]] and was released in 1914.&lt;ref name=aboutderbyshire /&gt;

==First World War==
In 1915, the year after the outbreak of the [[First World War]], Toplis joined the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] and served as a stretcher bearer, his first active duty being at [[Loos-en-Gohelle|Loos]]. His unit was shipped to the landings of [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], and when they returned, Toplis was hospitalised for [[dysentery]]. Afterwards he briefly worked in a munitions factory. His unit was later posted to [[Salonika]] and [[Egypt]] but he was sent back when he contracted [[malaria]]. In September 1917 his unit was shipped to [[Bombay]] for some months and then returned to Britain. Toplis made a public revisit to Blackwell posing in the uniform of a captain. The visit and some of his anecdotes were reported by the local newspaper, the ''[[Nottingham Evening Post]]'', who took a photograph (shown in this article) that they later released to the police for his 'wanted' notice in 1920.&lt;ref name=aboutderbyshire /&gt;

In August 1918, Toplis's father died and soon afterwards he deserted from [[Blackpool]]. He was sentenced at [[Nottingham]] [[Assizes]] to two years in prison for [[fraud]]. When released in 1920, he joined the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] and was stationed at [[Bulford Camp]]. He was soon selling [[rationed]] fuel on the [[black market]], [[forging]] false papers to steal other soldiers' salaries and wearing a colonel's [[uniform]] when he visited women in town. He often used a gold [[monocle]] as part of his disguise.

==Murder and pursuit==
Toplis went [[AWOL]] again on 24 April 1920. After 9:00 p.m., taxi driver Sidney George Spicer was found dead from a gunshot wound on [[Thruxton Down]], near [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]]. Toplis was seen in [[Bulford Camp]] around 11:00 p.m. The inquest into George Spicer's death took place in a barn on Thruxton Down. The jury returned a verdict of 'wilful murder' by Percy Toplis, foreshadowing the possibility of his execution when caught; it was the first British inquest in modern times to declare a man guilty of murder in his absence. Toplis spent the next couple of weeks in London posing as an officer. The police began to close in and he fled to [[Monmouth]], [[Wales]] and eventually to [[Tomintoul]], [[Scotland]]. On 1 June a farmer near Tomintoul saw smoke in a [[bothy]]. He alerted Police Constable George Greig and together they found Toplis sitting by a fire. Toplis fired his pistol, wounding them both and then fled on a bicycle. He cycled to [[Aberdeen]] and took a train to [[Carlisle railway station|Carlisle]], where he arrived on 5 June. He was seen in an Army base in [[Carlisle Castle]].

[[Image:toplis-mortuary.jpg|thumb|right|Mortuary photograph of Toplis]]
On 6 June, in [[Cumberland]], Police Constable Alfred Fulton met and questioned a man in "partial military dress" but let him go. Back at the station, he checked police circulars and noticed that this man matched the description of a man suspected of the Andover murder. He went back to apprehend Toplis but retreated when Toplis threatened him with a [[Webley Revolver|Webley Mk VI revolver]]. Inspector William Ritchie and Sergeant Robert Bertram, joined Fulton armed with Webley revolvers and had also disguised their uniforms.  It is believed that this may have been the result of orders from the Home Office to the [[Chief Constable]] Norman de Courcy-Parry. They set off by car to apprehend Toplis and were joined ''en route'' by the chief constable's civilian son, Norman de Courcy-Parry, Jr., on his 1000-cc motorcycle. Parry was armed with a Belgian automatic pistol, which he had brought back on his return from service during the war. They saw Toplis but did not recognise him until they had passed him and were some yards down the road. After quickly turning the car round, the group again approached Toplis. Norman de Courcy-Parry stopped the car, feigning mechanical trouble. He exited, pretending to check the trouble, as Toplis approached. The police officers then came out and challenged Toplis, who attempted to flee and fired at them. The officers ran towards him shooting and Toplis fell dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eden.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/museum-penrith-and-eden/museum-collections/percy-toplis/ Penrith Museum, biography and photograph] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613204433/http://www.eden.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/museum-penrith-and-eden/museum-collections/percy-toplis/ |date=13 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[inquest]] was held on 8 June and the next day, Toplis was buried in an [[unmarked grave]] near the top of [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]]'s Beacon Edge Cemetery. Toplis's belongings, including his monocle, were handed to [[Penrith and Eden Museum]], where they are on display. Despite plans by the Canadian Frank Dayson, a childhood friend of Toplis, to erect a headstone on the grave in 1980, as of 2017 Toplis's grave remains unmarked. In 2015 a plaque was unveiled to mark the spot where Toplis was shot dead.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-34842935&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged mutineer==

In 1978 William Allison and John Fairley published ''The Monocled Mutineer'', in which they portray Percy Toplis as a leading participant in the [[Étaples Mutiny]] as a consequence of his being among a band of deserters based in that area of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Allison | first1=William | last2=Fairley | first2=John | title=The Monocled Mutineer | publisher=[[Quartet Books]] | year=1978 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MWAJAQAAIAAJ | isbn=07-0432-154-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They say that Toplis was sought in France following the mutiny and posters for his arrest were issued. The fact that the British authorities went to such lengths to apprehend or silence Toplis is thought by Allison and Fairley to add credence to the view that he was one of the only leaders of the mutiny that escaped retribution.

After the book was published, Toplis's supposed career as a mutineer was dramatised by [[Howard Barker]] in his 1980 play ''Crimes in Hot Countries'', in which he is portrayed as an irrepressibly subversive seducer, "irresponsible and amoral, with little concern as to the consequences of his action for others".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lamb, ''The Theatre of Howard Barker'', Routledge, New York, 2004, p.62.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1986 [[BBC]] series entitled ''[[The Monocled Mutineer]]'', an adaptation by [[Alan Bleasdale]] of the book in which Toplis was played by [[Paul McGann]], portrayed him in a much more positive light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bleasdale | first1=Alan | last2=Allison | first2=William | last3=Fairley | first3=John | title=The Monocled Mutineer | publisher=[[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]] | year=1986 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WabzAAAAMAAJ | isbn=00-9168-671-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "gg"&gt;Hanna, Emma, ''The Great War on the Small Screen: Representing the First World War in Contemporary Britain'', Edinburgh University Press, 2009, pp.120ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The production fuelled accusations by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of the time of [[left-wing]] bias at the BBC. It was not only the right-wing press who denounced the accuracy of the series and the book on which it was based; the socialist historian [[Julian Putkowski]], originally recruited as a historical advisor to the programme, also publicly criticised the 'factual errors and misinterpretations that occur in the series'.&lt;ref name = "gg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Over the top with Hebert, Hugh 'Percy Toplis: The war with the BBC goes on. Hugh Hebert reports on the latest battle', The Guardian (1959–2003) [London (UK)] 15 Sep 1986: 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Putkowski pointed out that it was unlikely that Toplis played any part in the mutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-monocled-mutineer-is-innocent-466366.html | title=The Monocled Mutineer is innocent | newspaper=[[The Independent]] | date=12 February 2006 | last=Kelbie | first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Army records show that Toplis's unit was en route to India during the Étaples mutiny. No evidence exists to show that Toplis was absent from his unit but neither is there evidence that Toplis arrived in India, as the last recorded reference to him places him in [[Malta]].  He was a deserter and regularly moved between units masquerading as an [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] or an officer to get food, win money from gambling and for accommodation. It is possible that information about any involvement by Percy Toplis in the mutiny by soldiers in the training camp known as The Bull Ring at Étaples will be made clearer in 2017 when the official files regarding the mutiny are scheduled to be released into the [[public domain]] by the [[National Archives]] but the records of the Étaples Board of Enquiry have long since been destroyed.

'''Richmal Marie Oates-Whitehead''' (February 1970 – August 2005) was an employee of the [[British Medical Association]]. After the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], she claimed to have tended to the attack victims as a doctor, though she did not have any medical qualifications. She was found dead shortly after coming to the attention of the press.  Initially, it was suspected that she might have committed suicide, but it emerged later that she died of natural causes.

== Early life ==
Oates-Whitehead was born and brought up in [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]]. She suffered from [[epilepsy]] in her childhood. She displayed interest in becoming a [[physician]] or entering the medical profession right from her school days.{{fact|date=July 2017}} Her school friends described her as a caring person.    
    
While she did not become a physician, she trained as a [[Radiation therapy|radiation therapist]] for a year in 1991, working on a study on prevention of blood [[coagulation]].  This included an internship at [[Auckland]]. She moved to [[London]] in 2001, and prior to her last employment with [[British Medical Association]] (BMA) as an editor of ''Clinical Evidence'' (an online journal of the [[British Medical Journal]]), she was with the [[Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health]] in the role of clinical effectiveness coordinator. Immediately prior to her employment at the BMA she worked as a medical writer for ''Euro RSCG Medical Education''; throughout her brief employment at this company she posed as a doctor.

== London bombings ==
Oates-Whitehead came to attention in the aftermath of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] at [[Tavistock Square]]. She claimed to have been asked to help out by some firemen and that she did not hesitate for a moment.

She was widely hailed as a "heroine", after her accounts of treating the seriously injured were carried out by the press, especially in New Zealand. Subsequently, the [[New Zealand Herald]], among others, researched her background and found that she was not a doctor, but an editor of a BMA publication, a job that did not require medical qualifications.   
  
The media's suspicion was triggered by an account by Oates-Whitehead of how she heard a controlled explosion of another bomb by the police while she was busy tending to the victims. [[Scotland Yard]]'s denial of such an explosion and the absence of her name on either of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] or the New Zealand Medical Council registers of doctors strengthened the suspicions. Nor could the [[University of Auckland]] confirm that she was a graduate of the institution. Oates-Whitehead contested the newspaper's contention and threatened to sue it for defamation, but resigned from her post on health grounds when BMA announced an inquiry into her antecedents. The controlled explosion that Oates-Whitehead heard was later reported by others.

According to the Richmond and Twickenham Times newspaper there was a controlled explosion of a suspect package on the bus: 
'Sergeant Graham Cross and his unit of five were trying to set up a cordon around the King's Cross bombing when the number 30 bus was blown up in Tavistock Square.   
"We were only 100 metres away," Mr Cross said.  	 
Team member PC Ashley Walker was looking at the bus as it exploded before his eyes.   
As they ran closer, they saw "people's body parts and lumps of flesh", PC Walker remembers. One man's legs were trapped under a bench, while another mangled victim hanged with his head over the edge of the bombed top deck. &lt;br /&gt;  
Then they spotted a microwave box near a window. Another bomb?   
They thought it was.  
"But we had no choice, really," Mr Graham says. "We had to go get people off the bus."   
A bomb disposal unit later blew up the package in a controlled explosion.' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/news/690500.0/&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
'''Testimony given at the Coroner's Inquest confirms the controlled explosion of the microwave oven''':

Transcript:
	
Q. In relation to secondary devices, you were aware, I think, during your time at the scene, in relation to secondary devices, of the attendance of a Metropolitan Police explosives unit, explosives officer. Is that right?&lt;br /&gt;
A. That's correct.
 	
Q. I think, to use the phrase that you did in your recent statement in which you went over your actions on the day itself, you noted that the box that you considered may have contained a secondary device—which would be the microwave oven, as it transpired to be — was neutralised by the explosives officer. There was a controlled explosion at one stage carried out by explosives officers that day. Was that subsequent—put it another way, was that something that occurred or that didn't occur while you were there?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Sorry?
	 
Q. The question is probably poorly phrased. Were you aware of a controlled explosion?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Yes.
	 
Q. -- or simply the attendance of explosives officers? &lt;br /&gt;
A. I heard the controlled explosion, yes.
	 
Q. Right. I don't suppose you can provide a time for that, can you, or can you? &lt;br /&gt;
A. After 30 minutes. That's my guess, I can't know.
	 
Q. All right. That's all I want to ask about that.&lt;ref&gt;http://7julyinquests.independent.gov.uk/hearing_transcripts/18012011pm.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Following apprehensions from her family members, the Police entered her flat in West [[London]] on 17 August and found her dead body. Initially it was believed that she might have committed suicide due to the possible media [[Witch-hunt|witch hunt]] and loss of her job. However, [[Autopsy|post-mortem]] reports suggested that she died of a [[pulmonary embolism]]. The [[Coroner]]’s office ruled out an [[inquest]] as the death was due to natural causes.

== Alleged personality disorder ==
Newspaper reports indicate that Oates-Whitehead seemed to suffer from some [[personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1497099/Pathos-of-the-bogus-doctor-who-became-53rd-victim-of-77.html&lt;/ref&gt; She always carried a [[stethoscope]] in her handbag despite not being a doctor; described herself as an [[epidemiologist]] or a [[professor]] in her correspondence and told others that she travelled to [[Iraq]] and [[Indonesia]] to provide medical assistance to the war victims and the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|tsunami]] victims respectively.    
 
Her claims also included being afflicted with [[cancer]], being [[stalking|stalked]], suffering a mini [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], references to a retired professor as partner and giving birth to premature twins who died within a day. A common thread of appeal for either admiration or sympathy seems to have run through her stories.

In 2015 the city of Sturgis officially expanded the dates to have the rally start on the Friday before the first full week of August and end on the second Sunday. It was begun in 1938 by a group of Indian Motorcycle riders and was originally held for stunts and races. Attendance has historically been around 500,000 people, reaching a high of over 700,000 in 2015. The event generates around $800 million in revenue.&lt;ref name=dj2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-sturgis-motorcycle-rally-20140805-story.html |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date= August 5, 2014 |last=Fleming |first=Charles |title= Sturgis Motorcycle Rally by the numbers  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first rally was held by [[Indian Motocycle Manufacturing Company|Indian Motorcycle]] riders on August 14, 1938, by the Jackpine Gypsies motorcycle club.&lt;ref name="official-history"&gt;[http://sturgismotorcyclerally.com/timeline/ Official Site: Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; The club still owns and operates the tracks, [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]], and field areas where the rally is centered. The first event was called the "Black Hills Classic" and consisted of a single race with nine participants and a small audience. The founder is [[J.C. Hoel|Clarence "Pappy" Hoel]]. He purchased an Indian motorcycle franchise in Sturgis in 1936 and formed the Jackpine Gypsies that same year.&lt;ref name="official-history"/&gt; The Jackpine Gypsies were inducted to the [[Motorcycle Hall of Fame]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{mhof|344|Jackpine Gypsies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoel was inducted into the AMA Hall of Fame the following year, in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{mhof|198|J.C. Hoel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus of a motorcycle rally was originally [[Motorcycle sport|racing]] and [[stunt]]s. In 1961, the rally was expanded to include the Hillclimb and Motocross races.&lt;ref name="official-history" /&gt; This could include half-mile track racing (the first year in Sturgis, there were 19 participants), intentional board wall crashes, ramp jumps and head-on collisions with automobiles.

The Sturgis Rally has been held every year, with exceptions during World War II. For instance, in 1942, the event was not held due to gasoline rationing.&lt;ref name="official-history"/&gt;

==Rally impact on community==
For many years the city has been in a licensing agreement with a community non-profit, Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, Inc., and its predecessor-in-interest, the Sturgis Area Chamber of Commerce, that generates millions of dollars in royalties and sponsorship dollars.&lt;ref name="Black Hills State University"&gt;{{citation|title=70th Sturgis motorcycle rally statistics compiled by the city of Sturgis and the rally department|publisher=[[Black Hills State University]]|date=February 8, 2011|url=http://www.bhsu.edu/StudentLife/Living/ResidenceLife/SturgisRally/RallyNews/tabid/11232/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/3453/70th-Sturgis-motorcycle-rally-statistics-compiled-by-the-city-of-Sturgis-and-the-rally-department.aspx|accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012 the City Council reaffirmed this relationship through a unanimous proclamation.

The City of Sturgis has calculated that the Rally brings over $800 million to South Dakota annually.&lt;ref name="Black Hills State University"/&gt; The City of Sturgis earned almost $270,000 in 2011 from selling event guides and sponsorships. The rally makes up 95% of the city's annual revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daytondailynews.com/photo/ap/top-news/sturgis-rally/pwrkr/ Sturgis area businesses make 95% of their annual revenue from the 7 days of the rally.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 405 individuals jailed at the 2004 rally, and approximately $250,000 worth of motorcycles stolen annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dalton|first=Aaron|title=Biggest thing on two wheels.(TECHWATCH: This Month)|journal=Popular Mechanics|publisher=Hearst Magazines via HighBeam Research.|date=August 1, 2005|accessdate=2013-01-25|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-134210834.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rally-goers are a mix of white-collar and blue-collar workers and are generally welcomed as an important source of income for Sturgis and surrounding areas.&lt;ref name=npr2000&gt;{{citation|work=Morning Edition|publisher=[[National Public Radio]] via HighBeam Research.|title=Profile: Thousands of Harley riders converge on small South Dakota town every year for a rally|date=August 9, 2000|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-31350798.html|accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rally turns local roads into "parking lots",&lt;ref name=npr2000/&gt; and draws local law enforcement away from routine patrols.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Security + Service = Satisfaction.|journal=Journal of Property Management|publisher=via HighBeam Research|date=May 1, 2000 | last=Vellani|first=Karim|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63795876.html|accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the large numbers of people visiting the town and region served as a model for the state of Oregon in preparation for the [[solar eclipse of August 21, 2017]], given the expected impact on emergency services.&lt;ref name="Oregonian Hospital Preparations"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2017/08/antidote_for_rattlesnake_bites.html |title=Eclipse 2017: Hospitals stock up on blood, rattlesnake bite antidote |last=Lynne |first=Terry |date=2017-08-10 |website=The Oregonian |access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a number of mysterious, unsolved deaths at the Rally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sturgismotorcyclerally.com/assets/docs/uploads/rally-stats.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation to Sturgis==
Many attendees of the Sturgis Rally have families, bring their children and drive campers towing [[motorcycle trailer]]s to the rally, and ride their motorcycles just the last few miles. The director of the rally estimated in 2005 that less than half the attendees actually rode there.&lt;ref name=nyt2005&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2005/08/05/automobiles/05sturgis.html|title=The Really Easy Rider|first=Michelle| last= Higgins|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 5, 2005|accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shipping companies transport thousands of motorcycles to Sturgis for attendees who arrive via airline.&lt;ref name=nyt2005/&gt;

==Black Hills Run==
The '''Black Hills Run''' is a route favored by motorcycle riders, across the [[Black Hills]] from [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]] to [[Custer State Park]], South Dakota.  It reached the height of its popularity between 1939 and 1941.  The popularity of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally attracted additional attention to the route in recent years. The pine forested mountains of the Black Hills make for a unique scenic motorcycle ride.&lt;ref&gt;McKechnie, Gary.  ''Great American Motorcycle Tours'' Avalon Travel Publishing, 2002.

'''''The Small One''''' is a 1947 Christmas novelette written by [[Charles Tazewell]] and illustrated by [[Franklin Whitman]] about a young boy who has to sell his donkey named Small One.&lt;ref&gt;http://data.desmoinesregister.com/famous-iowans/charles-tazewell&lt;/ref&gt; It was adapted into [[The Small One|the Disney featurette]] in Christmas 1978.

[[File:The Small One front cover book.jpg|thumb|Front cover of ''The Small One'']]

==Plot==
The story starts with Padre who tells his boy Pablo about how donkeys aren't stubborn after Pablo is frustrated with the attitude of his donkey Cupido, who is doing nothing to work for him. So Padre tells the story that happened many miles from where they live in El Camino Del Notre [[Old Mexico]]. 

Small One was an old donkey who belonged to a woodcutter, whose son was kinder to him. One day the boy's father tells him to sell Small One to the tanner as he feels there is no use for him, as he is too old to work. The boy insists not to take him to the tanner's, but his father tells him not to cry over a donkey. The boy realizes there's no use arguing, so he goes off to town to sell Small One, but doesn't tell his father that he will sell him elsewhere. The first place he sees is an auction, where the bidder is selling horses. The boy asks the bidder to sell his donkey, but the bidder refuses and he and the crowd make fun of Small One which upsets the boy; the boy then sets off to see who else would buy him.

The boy and Small One both feel hopeless by sundown, and decide to go to the tanner's after all. Just then, the boy meets a nice man, who asks him if he can buy Small One, as he and his wife have a long way to go and she isn't very well. The boy sells the man Small One for one piece of [[silver]] and hurries to the gates before the guards close it. The boy promises Small One that when he grows up, he will buy him again and keep him. The man explains to the guards at the gate that his name is Joseph, his wife's name is Mary and they are heading to [[Bethlehem]], so they make their way into the distance. In the end the boy says his last goodbyes to his friend, and Small One, as told by Padre, made it all the way to Bethlehem with Joseph and Mary and saw the king being born;
despite how he was made fun of, he became part of the Christmas miracle. 

In the end, Pablo and Padre listen, wondering whether it was a donkey's hooves or to the sound of the church bells rehearsing the chimes for Christmas morning, but only Cupido knew what it really was.

{{nihongo|'''''Town of Evening Calm, Country of Cherry Blossoms'''''|夕凪の街 桜の国|Yūnagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni|lead=yes}} is a one-volume [[manga]] written and illustrated by [[Fumiyo Kōno]]. The two connected stories were first published in Japan by [[Futabasha]] in ''[[Weekly Manga Action]]'' in 2003 and 2004, then collected in a single ''[[tankōbon]]'' volume in 2004. The story is about a family of survivors of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]]. The author based the characters on people who were in [[Hiroshima]] or [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].

''Town of Evening Calm, Country of Cherry Blossoms'' was adapted as a [[live-action]] film directed by Kiyoshi Sasabe released in 2007, called '''''Yunagi City, Sakura Country''''' in English. It has also been adapted as a novel by Kei Kunii and as a radio drama produced in 2006.

The manga has received international praise for its simple but beautiful artwork and its quiet but "humane" anti-war message.&lt;ref name="Deppey"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PopCultureShock/&gt;&lt;ref name="manganews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="comicworldnews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="otaku"/&gt;&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; It received the Grand Prize for manga at the 2004 [[Japan Media Arts Festival]] and the 2005 [[Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize]] Creative Award. [[Kumiko Aso]] won several acting awards for her portrayal of Minami Hirano, one of the two protagonists, in the film adaptation.

==Plot==

''Town of Evening Calm, Country of Cherry Blossoms'' comprises two stories, "Town of Evening Calm" and "Country of Cherry Blossoms".

===Town of Evening Calm (''Yūnagi no Machi'')===

Set in Hiroshima in 1955, ten years after the  [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb was dropped]], "Town of Evening Calm" is the story of a young woman, Minami Hirano, who [[Hibakusha|survived the bomb]] when she was in her early teens. She lives with her mother, Fujimi, in a shanty-town near downtown, having lost her father and two sisters to the bomb; her younger brother, Asahi, was evacuated to [[Mito, Ibaraki]], where he was adopted by his aunt. Fujimi is a seamstress while Minami, who is "all thumbs" as her mother puts it, works as a clerk in an office, and together they are saving money for the trip to Mito to visit Asahi.

One of her co-workers, Yutaka Uchikoshi, cares for Minami and visits her shanty when she misses work because her mother is sick. He later gives her a pair of sandals made by his mother and a handkerchief, but when he tries to kiss her, she has a [[Flashback (psychological phenomenon)|flashback]] where she sees the victims of the bombing where they now stand and pushes him away. She runs off, still reliving the horrors of the attack, including finding her little sister's blackened body and watching her older sister die of [[radiation poisoning]] two months later. The next day at the office, she apologizes to Uchikoshi, saying she wants to somehow put the past behind her. She spends the day exhausted, however, and the next day becomes bedridden from the long-term effects of radiation poisoning. As Minami's condition worsens, she is visited by Uchikoshi and other co-workers, and dies just as her brother and aunt arrive.

===Country of Cherry Blossoms (''Sakura no Kuni'')===

"Country of Cherry Blossoms" is a story in two parts. Part one is set in 1987 in Tokyo. At the start of fifth grade, Nanami Ishikawa, the daughter of Minami's brother Asahi (and thus second-generation [[Hibakusha|atomic bomb victim]]), is a tomboy nicknamed "[[Ishikawa Goemon|Goemon]]" by her classmates, to her disgust. At baseball practice, she gets a bloody nose after being hit by a ball, after which she skips practice to visit her brother Nagio in the hospital, where he is being treated for asthma. On the way, she meets her best friend and next-door neighbor, a feminine girl named Toko Tone, who loans her subway fare and accompanies her. In Nagio's hospital room, they toss [[Sakura|cherry blossom petals]] that Nanami collected into the air, to give him the [[Hanami|experience of spring]] that he's missing. Nanami is scolded by her grandmother for visiting Nagio when she's not supposed to. That summer, her grandmother, Asahi's mother, Fujimi, dies, and that fall Nanami loses touch with Toko after her family moves closer to Nagio's hospital.

Part two takes place 17 years later, in 2004. Nanami, now working as an [[office lady]], lives with her recently retired father. One day Nagio, who recently graduated from [[medical school]], tells Nanami he ran into Toko as a nurse at the hospital where he is [[Internship (medicine)|interning]]. Nanami tells him she's worried their father's going [[senile]] because he has started wandering off for a couple days at time without explanation. 

One evening, Nanami follows Asahi as he leaves the apartment, and while she tails him runs into Toko and together they follow him onto an overnight bus to Hiroshima. In the morning, they follow as he visits several people before Toko leaves to visit the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park|Peace Park]]. Asahi visits his [[Japanese funeral#Grave|family grave]], then sits by the riverside, and while waiting Nanami discovers in the jacket of Toko's borrowed jacket a letter from Nagio to Toko, saying that her family asked him to stop seeing her as they believe his asthma is a result of the atomic bomb. 

In a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], Asahi recalls the riverbank as a shantytown, then remembers meeting Kyoka Ota, a neighborhood girl his mother hired to help her after Minami died, when he returns to Hiroshima to start college. Asahi begins tutoring Kyoka because her teachers believe she is stupid due to the atomic bomb. When Toko finds Nanami by the river, Toko is upset to the point of illness by what she saw at the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum|Peace Memorial Museum]], and Nanami finds them a hotel room and cares for her, even though she has flashbacks to seeing her mother's last illness when she was a young child. In another flashback, Asahi proposes to a grown Kyoka, against his mother's wishes, as Kyoka was exposed to the bomb.

According to Fumiyo Kōno's afterword, she was prompted to write ''Town of Evening Calm, Country of Cherry Blossoms'' when her editor asked her for a Hiroshima story. She was initially reluctant because, while she was born in Hiroshima neither she nor anyone in her family was a [[Hibakusha|survivor of the atomic bomb]], and growing up she found the subject upsetting and had tried to avoid it ever since. She decided to tackle the subject because she felt it was "unnatural and irresponsible for me to consciously try to avoid the issue." Living in Tokyo, she had come to realize that people outside of Hiroshima and Nagasaki didn't know about the effects of the bomb, not because they were avoiding the subject but because it is never talked about, and so she attempted the story because "drawing something is better than drawing nothing at all."&lt;ref name="afterword"&gt;{{cite book | title=Town of Evening Calm, Country of Cherry Blossoms | first=Fumiyo | last=Kouno | year=2007 | publisher=Last Gasp | chapter=Afterword | pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kōno described "Country of Cherry Blossoms" as "what I most needed to hear two years ago, when I still avoided anything to do with the atomic bomb."&lt;ref name="afterword"/&gt;

It eventually led to a thorough [[democratization]] of the country and to free and democratic elections.

The demonstrations were caused by high [[unemployment]], food [[inflation]], [[corruption]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Snapshot of Corruption in Tunisia|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/middle-east-north-africa/tunisia/snapshot.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Spencer |first=Richard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/tunisia/8258077/Tunisia-riots-US-warns-Middle-East-to-reform-or-be-overthrown.html |title=Tunisia riots: Reform or be overthrown, US tells Arab states amid fresh riots |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=13 January 2011|accessdate=14 January 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lack of [[political freedom]]s like [[freedom of speech]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Yasmine |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/01/20111614145839362.html |title=Tunisia's bitter cyberwar |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and poor [[living conditions]].

The protests were sparked by the [[self-immolation]] of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]] on 17 December 2010&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12120228 Tunisia suicide protester Mohammed Bouazizi dies], BBC, 5 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/22/world/africa/22sidi.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;src=twrhp|author=Fahim, Kareem|title=Slap to a Man's Pride Set Off Tumult in Tunisia|work=The New York Times|date=21 January 2011|page=2|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/weekinreview/23worth.html?src=twrhp|title=How a Single Match Can Ignite a Revolution|author=Worth, Robert F.|work=The New York Times|date=21 January 2011|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to the ousting of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 28 days later on 14 January 2011, when he officially resigned after fleeing to [[Saudi Arabia]], ending 23 years in power.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Davies, Wyre |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12195025 |title=Tunisia: President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali forced out |publisher=BBC News |date=15 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2011/01/16/18669320.php |title=Uprising in Tunisia: People Power topples Ben Ali regime |publisher=Indybay |date=16 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour unions were an integral part of the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenddemocracy.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=11792083&amp;Itemid=347 |title=Trade unions: the revolutionary social network at play in Egypt and Tunisia |publisher=Defenddemocracy.org |accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet]] was awarded the [[2015 Nobel Peace Prize]] for "its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia in the wake of the Tunisian Revolution of 2011".&lt;ref name=PressRelease&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 2015 - Press Release|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2015/press.html|website=Nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB 2014|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests inspired similar actions throughout the Arab world, known as the [[Arab Spring]].

==Naming==
In Tunisia and the wider Arab world, the protests and change in government are called '''the Revolution''' or sometimes the '''Sidi Bouzid Revolt''', derived from [[Sidi Bouzid]], the city where the initial protests began.&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt;&lt;ref name="SidiBouzid_libcom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/forums/news/protests-spread-tunisia-29122010 |title=The Sidi Bouzid Revolution: Ben Ali flees as protests spread in Tunisia |publisher=libcom.org |accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SidiBouzid_YT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8thJM2nmd_g |title=Revolte Tunisie Sidi bouzid 3 |publisher=YouTube |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Western media, these events have been dubbed the '''Jasmine Revolution or Jasmine Spring'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carvin|first=Andy|title=Sidi Bou Zid: A Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia|url=http://storify.com/acarvin/sidi-bou-zid-a-jasmine-revolution-in-tunisia|publisher=Storify|accessdate=7 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211214152/http://storify.com/acarvin/sidi-bou-zid-a-jasmine-revolution-in-tunisia|archive-date=11 December 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; after Tunisia's national flower and in keeping with the geopolitical nomenclature of "[[color revolutions]]".

==Background==
President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] had ruled Tunisia since 1987, mostly as a one-party state with the [[Democratic Constitutional Rally]] (known as the RCD) in power. His government was characterized by the development of Tunisia's private sector in favor of foreign investment, and the repression of political opposition. Foreign media and NGOs criticized his government, which was supported by the United States and France. As a result, the initial reactions to Ben Ali's abuses by the U.S. and France were muted, and most instances of socio-political protest in the country, when they occurred at all, rarely made major news headlines.&lt;ref name="end of an era"/&gt;

Riots in Tunisia were rare&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/10/world/main7233191.shtml |title=Deadly Riots in Tunisia Shut Down Schools |publisher=CBS News |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and noteworthy, especially since the country is generally considered to be wealthy and stable as compared to other countries in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/2011191414183128.html |title=Protesters killed in Tunisia riots |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=9 January 2011 |accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any form of protests in the country were previously successfully repressed and kept silent by the former regime and protesters would be jailed for such actions, as were for example protests by hundreds of unemployed demonstrators in [[Redeyef]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="precursor"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Jean-Marie|last1=Lemaire|first2=Rim|last2=Mathlouti|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110215-reporters-tunisia-redeyef-gafsa-mining-phosphate-accusations-competition-rigged-ben-ali-supporters-protests-journalists |title=Redeyef, the precursor of the Tunisian revolution |publisher=France 24 |date=15 February 2011 |accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Al Jazeera English]]'' also said that Tunisian activists are amongst the most outspoken in its part of the world with various messages of support being posted on ''Twitter'' for Bouazizi.&lt;ref name="begin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/2010122063745828931.html |title=Riots reported in Tunisian city – Africa – Al Jazeera English |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=20 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[op-ed]] article in the same network said of the action that it was "suicidal protests of despair by Tunisia's youth." It pointed out that the state-controlled [[National Solidarity Fund]] and the [[National Employment Fund]] had traditionally subsidized many goods and services in the country but had started to shift the "burden of providence from state to society" to be funded by the ''[[bidonville]]s'', or [[shanty towns]], around the richer towns and suburbs.{{clarify|date=January 2011}} It also cited the "marginalisation of the agrarian and arid central and southern areas [that] continue[s] unabated."&lt;ref name="protestsgoingon"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sadiki, Larbi |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2010/12/20101227142811755739.html |title=Tunisia: The battle of Sidi Bouzid – Opinion – Al Jazeera English |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=27 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests were also called an "uprising" because of "a lethal combination of poverty, unemployment and political repression: three characteristics of most Arab societies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andoni, Lamis |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2010/12/20101231161958792947.html |title=The rebirth of Arab activism – Opinion |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=31 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mohamed Bouazizi and Sidi Bouzid==
Twenty-six-year-old [[Mohamed Bouazizi]] had been the sole income earner in his extended family of eight. He operated a vegetable or apple cart (the contents of the cart are disputed) for seven years in [[Sidi Bouzid]] 190 miles (300&amp;nbsp;km) south of Tunis. On 17 December 2010, a female officer confiscated his cart and produce. Bouazizi, who had had such an event happen to him before, tried to pay the 10-dinar fine (a day's wages, equivalent to 7USD). In response the policewoman 
insulted his deceased father and slapped him. The officer, [[Faida Hamdy|Faida Hamdi]], stated that she was not even a policewoman, but a city employee who had been tasked that morning with confiscating produce from vendors without licenses. When she tried to do so with Bouazizi a scuffle ensued. Hamdi says she called the police who then beat Bouazizi.&lt;ref name=WAJMJ&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Woman Who Blew Up the Arab World|journal=World Affairs Journal|date=17 May 2012|url=http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/michael-j-totten/woman-who-blew-arab-world|accessdate=17 May 2012|author=Totten, Michael J. |quote="Barack Obama mentioned me in a speech. He said I was a cop. He said I slapped Mohamed Bouazizi. He's a stupid fool for not checking. Americans are great people, but you need to do a better job of checking your information."}}&lt;/ref&gt; A humiliated Bouazizi then went to the provincial headquarters in an attempt to complain to local municipality officials and to have his produce returned. He was refused an audience. Without alerting his family, at 11:30&amp;nbsp;am and within an hour of the initial confrontation, Bouazizi returned to the headquarters, doused himself with a flammable liquid and set himself on fire. Public outrage quickly grew over the incident, leading to protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2043557,00.html | title=Bouazizi: The Man Who Set Himself and Tunisia on Fire | author=Abouzeid, Rania | date=21 January 2011|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/922279--suicide-protest-helped-topple-tunisian-regime | title=Suicide protest helped topple Tunisian regime | location=Toronto | work=The Star | date=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This immolation and the subsequent heavy-handed response by the police to peaceful marchers caused riots the next day in [[Sidi Bouzid]] that went largely unnoticed, although [[social media]] sites such as Facebook and YouTube featured images of police dispersing youths who attacked shop windows and damaged cars. Bouazizi was subsequently transferred to a hospital near Tunis. In an attempt to quell the unrest President [[Zine el Abidine Ben Ali]] visited Bouazizi in hospital on 28 December 2010. Bouazizi died on 4 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE70408420110105 | title=Tunisian who sparked rare protests dies: relatives -Reuters | agency=Reuters | date=5 January 2011 | accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests==
{{Revolution sidebar}}
On 28 November 2010, [[WikiLeaks]] and five major newspapers (Spain's ''[[El País]]'', France's ''[[Le Monde]]'', Germany's ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', the United Kingdom's ''[[The Guardian]]'', and the United States' ''[[The New York Times]]'') simultaneously published the first 220 of 251,287 leaked documents labeled confidential.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/07/wikileaks-tunisia-first-lady |title=WikiLeaks cables: Tunisia blocks site reporting 'hatred' of first lady|first1=Ian |last1=Black|first2=Middle East|last2=editor|date=7 December 2010|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included descriptions of corruption and repression by the Tunisian regime. It is widely believed that the information in the WikiLeaks documents contributed to the protests, which began a few weeks later.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt;

There were reports of police obstructing demonstrators and using [[tear gas]] on hundreds of young protesters in [[Sidi Bouzid]] in mid-December 2010. The protesters had gathered outside regional government headquarters to demonstrate against the treatment of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]]. Coverage of events was limited by Tunisian media. On {{Nowrap|19 December}}, extra police were present on the streets of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/2010122063745828931.html|title=Images posted on social-network sites show police intervening to halt disturbances ignored by national media|date=20 December 2010|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December, Lahseen Naji, a protester, responded to "hunger and joblessness" by electrocuting himself after climbing an [[electricity pylon]].&lt;ref name="Protests continue in Tunisia" /&gt; Ramzi Al-Abboudi also killed himself because of financial difficulties arising from a business debt by the country's [[micro-credit]] solidarity programme.&lt;ref name="protestsgoingon" /&gt; On {{Nowrap|24 December}}, Mohamed Ammari was fatally shot in the chest by police in Bouziane.

Violence later increased as Tunisian authorities and residents of [[Sidi Bouzid Governorate]] encountered each other once again. The protests had reached the capital [[Tunis]]&lt;ref name="Protests continue in Tunisia"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/2010122682433751904.html|title=Protests continue in Tunisia|date=26 December 2010|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on {{Nowrap|27 December}} with about 1,000 citizens expressing solidarity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/video/africa/2010/12/20101228182021539319.html |title=Tunisia jobless protests rage |publisher=Al Jazeera|date=28 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with residents of Sidi Bouzid and calling for jobs. The rally, which was called by independent trade union activists, was stopped by security forces. The protests also spread to [[Sousse]], [[Sfax]] and [[Meknassy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/20101227204853391930.html |title=Job protests escalate in Tunisia |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=28 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day the Tunisian Federation of Labour Unions held another rally in [[Gafsa]] which was also blocked by security forces. At the same time about 300 lawyers held a rally near the government's palace in Tunis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Randeree, Bilal |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/2010122819724363553.html |title=Tensions flare across Tunisia |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=28 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests continued again on the {{Nowrap|29 December}}.&lt;ref name="wed" /&gt;

On 30 December, police peacefully broke up a protest in [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]] while using force to disrupt further demonstrations in [[Sbikha]] and [[Chebba]]. Momentum appeared to continue with the protests on {{Nowrap|31 December}} and further demonstrations and public gatherings by lawyers in Tunis and other cities following a call by the Tunisian National Lawyers Order. Mokhtar Trifi, president of the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH), said that lawyers across Tunisia had been "savagely beaten."&lt;ref name="Another Tunisian protester dies" /&gt; There were also unconfirmed reports of another man attempting to commit suicide in [[El Hamma]].&lt;ref name="video: today a young unemployed man trying to commit a suicide in El Hamma #sidibouzid"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://24sur24.posterous.com/video-today-a-young-unemployed-man-trying-to|title=video: today a young unemployed man trying to commit a suicide in El Hamma #sidibouzid|date=31 December 2010|work=Nawaat|accessdate=31 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 January 2011, protests in [[Thala, Tunisia|Thala]] over unemployment and a high [[cost of living]] turned violent. At a demonstration of 250 people, mostly students, in support of the protesters in Sidi Bouzid, police fired tear gas; one canister landed in a local mosque. In response, the protesters were reported to have set fire to tyres and attacked the office of [[Constitutional Democratic Rally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Randeree, Bilal |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/201114101752467578.html |title=Violent clashes continue in Tunisia – Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more general protests sought changes in the government's online censorship, where a lot of the media images have been broadcast. Tunisian authorities also allegedly carried out [[phishing]] operations to take control of user passwords and check online criticism. Both state and non-state websites had been hacked.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera Ryan"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan, Yasmine |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/01/20111614145839362.html |title=Tunisia's bitter cyberwar |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 95% of Tunisia's 8,000 lawyers went on strike, according to the chairman of the national [[bar association]]. He said "The strike carries a clear message that we do not accept unjustified attacks on lawyers. We want to strongly protest against the beating of lawyers in the past few days."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/201116193136690227.html |title=Thousands of Tunisia lawyers strike |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported on the following day that teachers had also joined the strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Sandels |first=Alexandra |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-tunisia-riots-20110108,0,1279820.story |title=Rioting spreads across Tunisia; unrest also reported in Algeria |work=Los Angeles Times |date=8 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to 11 January protests police used riot gear to disperse protesters ransacking buildings, burning tires, setting fire to a bus and burning two cars in the working class suburb of [[Ettadhamen-Mnihla]] in Tunis. The protesters were said to have chanted "We are not afraid, we are not afraid, we are afraid only of God." Military personnel were also deployed in many cities around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/video/africa/2011/01/2011111214716877786.html |title=Tunisia unrest spreads to capital – Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January, a reporter from the Italian state-owned television broadcaster ''[[RAI]]'' stated that he and his cameraman were beaten with batons by police during a riot in Tunis' central district and that the officers then confiscated their camera.&lt;ref name="tg3web"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rai.tv/dl/RaiTV/programmi/media/ContentItem-0ec2c1f9-c6f3-48cd-8166-bc1eca6d13a9-tg3.html|title=Tunisi.

[[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] also organised protests after [[Friday prayer]] on 14 January to call for re-establishing the Islamic [[caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNRhq4fFAto&amp;feature=player_embedded |title=Protests organized by Hizb ut-Tahrir calling for the re-establishment of the Islamic caliphate |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day later, it also organised other protests that went to the [[9 April Prison]] to free political prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alokab.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=56256 |title=Call for re-establishing Caliphate in streets of Tunisia and freeing political prisoners |publisher=Alokab.com |accessdate=15 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707115506/http://www.alokab.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=56256 |archive-date=7 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on 14 January (the same day that Ben Ali fled), [[Lucas Dolega]], a photojournalist working for [[European Pressphoto Agency]], was hit in the forehead by a [[tear gas]] canister allegedly fired by the police at short range; he died two days later.&lt;ref&gt;Laurent, Olivier (16 January 2011) "[http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/news/1937417/french-photographer-dies-tunisia UNESCO, French government call for investigation of Lucas Dolega's death &lt;nowiki&gt;[update 7]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]", ''British Journal of Photography'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119010423/http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/news/1937417/french-photographer-dies-tunisia |date=19 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, David (18 January 2011) "[http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/news/Photographer-Dies-of-1505.shtml Photographer dies of injuries in Tunis]", ''Photo District News''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruggmann, Matthias et al.

==The end of Ben Ali's rule==
During a national television broadcast on {{Nowrap|28 December}}, [[List of Presidents of Tunisia|President]] [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] criticized people for their protests calling the perpetrators "extremists and mercenaries" and warned of "firm" punishment. He also accused "certain foreign television channels of broadcasting false allegations without verification, based on dramatization, fermentation and deformation by media hostile to Tunisia."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/2010122823238574209.html|title=Tunisia president warns protesters|date=28 December 2010|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His remarks were ignored and the protests continued.&lt;ref name="wed"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/20101229122733122341.html|title=Tunisia struggles to end protests|date=29 December 2010|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 December, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali shuffled his cabinet to remove his communications minister [[Oussama Romdhani]], while also announcing changes to the trade and handicrafts, religious affairs, communication and youth portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2010/12/29/131431.html|title=Tunisian president removes ministers after protests|date=29 December 2010|publisher=[[Al Arabiya]]|accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day he also announced the dismissal of the governors of Sidi Bouzid, [[Jendouba Governorate|Jendouba]] and [[Zaghouan Governorate|Zaghouan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rnw.nl/africa/bulletin/more-heads-roll-tunisian-social-crisis|title=More heads roll in Tunisian social crisis|date=30 December 2010|work=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]]|accessdate=30 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310064305/http://www.rnw.nl/africa/bulletin/more-heads-roll-tunisian-social-crisis|archivedate=10 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, Ben Ali said 300,000 new jobs would be created, though he did not clarify what that meant. However, he also described the protests as "the work of masked gangs that attacked at night government buildings and even civilians inside their homes in a terrorist act that cannot be overlooked." [[Ahmed Najib Chebbi]], the leader of the [[Progressive Democratic Party (Tunisia)|Progressive Democratic Party]], then said that despite official claims of police firing in self-defense "the demonstrations were non-violent and the youths were claiming their rights to jobs" and that "the funeral processions [for those killed on 9 January] turned into demonstrations, and the police fired [at] the youths who were at these ... processions." He then criticised Ben Ali's comments as the protesters were "claiming their civil rights, and there is no terrorist act...no religious slogans," while accusing Ben Ali of "looking for scapegoats." He further criticised the additional jobs offered as mere "promises."&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite web|author=Randeree, Bilal |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/201111016239214548.html |title=Tunisian leader promises new jobs – Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January, [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]] dissolved his government and declared a [[state of emergency]].

Saudi Arabia cited "exceptional circumstances" for their heavily criticised decision to give him asylum saying it was also "in support of the security and stability of their country." The Saudi decision was "not out of sympathy" for Ben Ali (who had long fought against [[Islamism|Islamists]] in Tunisia). Saudi Arabia demanded Ben Ali remain "out of politics" as a condition for accepting him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ben Ali gets refuge in Saudi Arabia|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/201111652129710582.html|publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial impact of Ben Ali's overthrow==

In mid-February 2011, about 4,000 mostly Tunisian refugees landed on the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]], causing the authorities to declare a state of emergency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/02/20112122328974957.html |title=Italy declares migrant emergency – Europe |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that would allow for federal aid to the island.

The comments started a row between the two countries with the Tunisian Foreign Ministry saying it was ready to work with Italy and others but that it "categorically rejects any interference in its internal affairs or any infringement of its sovereignty." In response, Italy's Foreign Minister [[Franco Frattini]] said that both countries share a "common interest" to halt the immigration, while he also offered "logistical help in terms of police and equipment. Until now the system of patrolling the coasts of Northern Africa has worked and we want to re-establish the technique, which had reduced illegal immigration to zero until a month ago." Tunisia then said that it had troops patrolling southern fishing ports and that checkpoints had been erected in coastal towns. By 14 February, at least 2,000 refugees had been sent to [[Sicily]] with the other 2,000 [[quarantine]]d at a re-opened holding centre.&lt;ref name="aljazrefugeeresponse"/&gt; On 2 March about 350 more people arrived on the island.

The [[International Organisation for Migration]] said that no new boats had been spotted. The EU's Catherine Ashton was on a visit to Tunisia to discuss the issue.

France, the former colonial power of Tunisia, was one of just a few states that expressed strong support for the Ben Ali government prior to its ouster, though protests were held in solidarity with Tunisia in several French cities and the [[French Socialist Party]] voiced support for the popular revolution.

The lack of coverage in the domestic state-controlled media was criticised.&lt;ref name="begin"/&gt; Writer/activist [[Jillian York]] alleged that the [[mainstream media]], particularly in the Western world, was providing less coverage and less sympathetic coverage to the Tunisia protests relative to Iranian protests and the [[Iranian Green Movement|Green movement]] and China's censorship. York alleged the "US government—which intervened heavily in Iran, approving circumvention technology for export and famously asking Twitter to halt updates during a critical time period—has not made any public overtures toward Tunisia at this time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=York, Jillian |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/20111981222719974.html |title=Activist crackdown: Tunisia vs Iran – Opinion |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=9 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite criticism about the "sparse" level of coverage and "little interest" given to the demonstrations by the international media, the protests were hailed by some commentators as "momentous events" in Tunisian history.&lt;ref name="How"/&gt; [[Brian Whitaker]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', suggested on 28 December 2010, that the protests would be enough to bring an end to Ben Ali's presidency and noted similarities with the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|protests]] that led to the end of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]'s reign in [[Romania]] in 1989,&lt;ref name="How"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Whitaker, Brian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/dec/28/tunisia-ben-ali|title=How a man setting fire to himself sparked an uprising in Tunisia|date=28 December 2010|work=The Guardian |location=UK|accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Steven Cook, writing for the [[Council of Foreign Relations]], notes that a [[Tipping point (sociology)|tipping point]] is only obvious after the fact, and points to the counter-example of the [[2009-2010 Iranian election protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cfr.org/cook/2011/01/06/the-last-days-of-ben-ali/ |title=The Last Days of Ben Ali? |publisher=Steven Cook's Blog |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Ali's governing strategy was nevertheless regarded as in serious trouble,&lt;ref name="protestwave"/&gt; and [[Elliot Abrams]] noted both that demonstrators were able for the first time at the end of 2010 to defy the security forces and that the regime had no obvious successors outside of Ben Ali's own family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cfr.org/abrams/2011/01/07/is-tunisia-next/ |title=Is Tunisia Next? |publisher=Elliott Abrams: Pressure Points |date=7 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The French management of the crisis came under severe criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lepost.fr/article/2011/01/15/2371842_la-calamiteuse-gestion-de-la-crise-tunisienne-par-la-diplomatie-francaise.html |title=La calamiteuse gestion de la crise tunisienne par la diplomatie française – calvero sur |publisher=Lepost.fr |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with notable silence in the mainstream media in the run-up to the crisis with its former protectorate with which it maintained friendly relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Claire |last=Ulrich |url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/16/france-our-embarassing-ex-friend-monsieur-ben-ali/ |title=France: Our Embarrassing Ex Friend, Monsieur Ben Ali |publisher=Global Voices |date=16 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repercussion analysis==
''[[Al Jazeera]]'' believed the ousting of the president meant the "glass ceiling of fear has been for ever shattered in Tunisia and that the police state that Ben Ali created in 1987 when he came to power in a coup seems to be disintegrating", though it added that Ben Ali's resignation, following his statement that he had been "duped by his entourage" may not entirely be sincere. ''[[Le Monde]]'' criticised French President Nicolas Sarkozy and the European Union's "Silence over the Tragedy" when the unrest broke.&lt;ref name="end of an era"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ahelbarra, Hashem |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/2011/01/14/tunisia-end-era |title=Tunisia: The end of an era &amp;#124; Al Jazeera Blogs |publisher=Blogs.aljazeera.net |accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' suggested that [[mobile telecommunications]] played an influential role in the "revolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/Africa-Monitor/2011/0115/Tunisia-s-Jasmine-Revolution-and-how-mobile-phones-helped-it-happen |title=Tunisia's Jasmine Revolution, and how mobile phones helped it happen |work=The Christian Science Monitor |date=15 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolt in Tunisia began speculation that the Tunisian Jasmine Revolution would lead to protests against the multiple other autocratic regimes across the [[Arab world]]. This was most famously captured in the phrase asking whether "Tunisia is the Arab [[Gdańsk]]?". The allusion refers to the Polish [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity movement]] and Gdańsk's role as the birthplace of the movement that [[Collapse of Communism|ousted Communism in Eastern Europe]]. The phrase appeared in outlets such as the [[BBC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9362000/9362677.stm |title=Today – Is this the 'Arab world's Gdansk?' |publisher=BBC News |date=15 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as editorials by well known columnists [[Rami George Khouri|Rami Khouri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondoweiss.net/2011/01/khouri-tunisia-is-gdansk-shipyard-of-80-with-jazeera-as-megaphone-to-other-arab-countries.html |title=Khouri: Tunisia is Gdansk shipyard of ‘80 with Jazeera as megaphone to other Arab countries! |publisher=Mondoweiss.net |date=16 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roger Cohen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/opinion/18iht-edcohen18.html | title = The Arab Gdansk | accessdate=28 January 2011 | author=Cohen, Roger |work=The New York Times | date=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Larbi Sadiki]] suggested that although "conventional wisdom has it that 'terror' in the Arab world is monopolised by al-Qaeda in its various incarnations", there was also the fact that "regimes in countries like Tunisia and Algeria have been arming and training security apparatuses to fight Osama bin Laden [but] were [still] caught unawares by the 'bin Laden within': the terror of marginalisation for the millions of educated youth who make up a large portion of the region's population. The winds of uncertainty blowing in the Arab west – the [[Maghreb]] – threaten to blow eastwards towards the [[Levant]] as the marginalised issue the fatalistic scream of despair to be given freedom and bread or death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sadiki, Larbi |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/201111413424337867.html |title=The 'bin Laden' of marginalisation – Opinion |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar opinion by [[Lamis Ardoni]] carried by Al Jazeera said that the protests had "brought down the walls of fear, erected by repression and marginalisation, thus restoring the Arab peoples' faith in their ability to demand social justice and end tyranny." He also said that the protests that succeeded in toppling the leadership should serve as a "warning to all leaders, whether supported by international or regional powers, that they are no longer immune to popular outcries of fury" even though Tunisia's ostensible change "could still be contained or confiscated by the country's ruling elite, which is desperately clinging to power." He called the protests the "Tunisian [[wikt:intifada|intifada"]] which had "placed the Arab world at a crossroads." He further added that if the change was ultimately successful in Tunisia it could "push the door wide open to freedom in Arab word {{sic}}. If it suffers a setback we shall witness unprecedented repression by rulers struggling to maintain their absolute grip on power. Either way, a system that combined a starkly unequal distribution of wealth with the denial of freedoms has collapsed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andoni, Lamis|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/2011115135046129936.html |title=To the tyrants of the Arab world... |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=16 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Mark LeVine]] noted that the events in Tunisia could spiral into the rest of the [[Arab world]] as the movement was "inspiring people...to take to the streets and warn their own sclerotic and autocratic leaders that they could soon face a similar fate." He then cited solidarity protests in Egypt where protesters chanted "[[Kefaya]]" and "We are next, we are next, Ben Ali tell Mubarak he is next;" and that Arab bloggers were supporting the movement in Tunisia as "the African revolution commencing...the global anti-capitalist revolution." He pointed to an article in ''[[al-Nahar]]'' that talked of an "inhuman globalisation" that had been imposed on the Arab world, however a "human" nationalism had not taken place. LeVine then accused the Obama administration in the United States of double standards when Clinton was in the region meeting with political and civil society leaders; however, she responded to a question about the protests, saying "We can't take sides", which was read{{By whom|date=March 2015}} as a failure to seize the "[[rein]]s of history" and "usher in a new era" to "defeat the forces of extremism" without the violent conflict in the Afghanistan-Pakistan area. Pointing out Clinton's remarks about regimes whose "foundations are sinking into the sand" and needed "reform", LeVine argued that US foreign policy in the Middle East and the [[ummah|Muslim world]] was "equally in danger of sinking into the sands if the President and his senior officials are not willing to get ahead of history's suddenly accelerating curve." He added, "It is the US and Europe, as much as the leaders of the region, who in Clinton's words are in need of 'a real vision for that future.'" Finally he said there were two scenarios that could play out: "a greater democratic opening across the Arab world," or a similar situation to Algeria in the early 1990s when the [[Algerian legislative election, 1991|democratic election]] was annulled and Algeria went into a [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/20111167156465567.html|title=Tunisia: How the US got it wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Fisk]] asked if this was "The end of the age of dictators in the Arab world?" and partly answered the question in saying that Arab leaders would be "shaking in their boots". He also pointed out that the "despot" Ben Ali sought refuge in the same place as the ousted [[Idi Amin]] of [[Uganda]] and that "the French and the Germans and the Brits, dare we mention this, always praised the dictator for being a 'friend' of civilised Europe, keeping a firm hand on all those Islamists." He notably pointed at the "demographic explosion of youth" of the Maghreb, though he said that the change brought about in Tunisia may not last. He thinks "this is going to be the same old story. Yes, we would like a democracy in Tunisia – but not too much democracy. Remember how we wanted Algeria to have a democracy back in the early Nineties? Then when it looked like the Islamists might win the second round of voting, we supported its military-backed government in suspending elections and crushing the Islamists and initiating a civil war in which 150,000 died. No, in the Arab world, we want law and order and stability." He added that "If it can happen in the holiday destination Tunisia, it can happen anywhere, can't it?"&lt;ref name="britian"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/fisk/the-brutal-truth-about-tunisia-2186287.html|title=The brutal truth about Tunisia|work=The Independent | location=London|first=Robert|last=Fisk|date=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake Hounshell wrote on Foreign Policy.com that the Tunisian precedent raised the prospect of a "new trend. There is something horrifying and, in a way, moving about these suicide attempts. It's a shocking, desperate tactic that instantly attracts attention, revulsion, but also sympathy."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/world-12206551 Accessed 26/12/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of the Internet===
{{further|Internet#Politics and political revolutions}}

The use of communication technologies, and the Internet in particular, has been widely credited as contributor to the mobilisation of protests.&lt;ref&gt;Kravets, David. (22 August 2013) [https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/ Threat Level]. ''Wired''. Retrieved 9 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A blog associated with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' described the intricate efforts of the Tunisian authorities to control such online media as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/01/tunisia/|title=Tweeting Tyrants Out of Tunisia: Global Internet at Its Best|publisher=Threat Level / Wired | first1=Nate|last1=Anderson|first2=Ars|last2=Technica|date=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter and Facebook. Other regional regimes were also on higher alert to contain spillover effects that may ensue.

On 11 March 2011, [[Reporters Without Borders]] gave its annual award for online media freedom to the Tunisian blogging group [[Nawaat.org]]. Founded in 2004, it played an important role rallying anti-government protesters by reporting on the protests which the national media ignored.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110314155555/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jn6P6Y2M4esLbvifHY0Foqb2vQTA?docId=361d3296b81a471bbfffeccbe1202202 Tunisian bloggers win online media award], [[Associated Press|AP]], 11 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional instability==
{{main|Arab Spring}}
{{see also|Mohamed Bouazizi#Copycat incidents}}

Bouazizi's actions resonated across the region, with many others across the Arab world following suit.  In January 2011, the BBC reported: "Clearly the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi has resonated across the region...'There is great interest. The Egyptian people and the Egyptian public have been following the events in Tunisia with so much joy, since they can draw parallels between the Tunisian situation and their own.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Westcott |first=Kathryn |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12206551 |title=Why do people set themselves on fire? |publisher=BBC News |date=18 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the beginning of the uprising in Tunisia, similar protests took place in almost all Arab countries from [[Morocco]] to [[Iraq]], as well as in other states, ranging from [[Gabon]] to [[Albania]], Iran, [[Kazakhstan]], [[2011 United States public employee protests|United States]], [[2011 Indian anti-corruption movement|India]] and others. Following [[2011 Egyptian revolution|weeks of protests]], Egyptian president [[Hosni Mubarak]] resigned on 11 February. Major protests against longtime Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] broke out on 17 February and quickly deteriorated into [[2011 Libyan civil war|civil war]], ultimately resulting in the downfall of the Gaddafi regime later in the year. [[2011 Syrian uprising|Syria]] experienced a major uprising of people calling for the removal of President [[Bashar al-Assad]].  The Syrian uprising also deteriorated into a [[Syrian Civil War|civil war]], giving rise to the militant group, [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], and partly causing the current [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|refugee crisis]]. In addition, [[2011 Yemeni protests|Yemen]], [[2011 Bahraini protests|Bahrain]], and [[2011 Algerian protests|Algeria]] have seen major protests.

However, a financial analyst in [[Dubai]] suggested that "the spillover effect of the political turbulence to the large countries in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] is non-existent as there are no similar drivers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hankir |first=Zahra |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-30/dubai-shares-plunge-most-in-year-lead-gulf-drop-on-egypt-risk-protests.html |title=Dubai Shares Fall Most Since May on Egypt Unrest, Pacing Mideast Decline |publisher=Bloomberg |date=30 January 2011|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In mid-May 2013, Tunisia banned the Salafist [[Ansar al-Sharia (Tunisia)|Ansar al-Sharia]] from carrying out party congresses. The day after the congress was due to be carried out, clashes between security forces and party supporters in [[Kairouan]] resulted in one death amid attempts to disperse those who wanted to carry out the events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/05/20135198155650292.html Salafist group clashes with police in Tunisia – Africa]. ''Al Jazeera''. 20 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tunisian president, Beji Caid Essebsi, renewed the state of emergency in October 2015 for three months due to previous terror attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/10/why-is-the-state-of-emergency-renewed-three-times-tunisia.html|title=The real reason Tunisia renewed its state of emergency|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220140248/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/10/why-is-the-state-of-emergency-renewed-three-times-tunisia.html|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 550''', adopted on 11 May 1984, after hearing representations from the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]] and reaffirming resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 365|365]] (1974), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 367|367]] (1975), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 541|541]] (1983) and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 544|Resolution 544]] (1983), the Council condemned the illegal [[secession]]ist activities in the occupied part of the Republic of Cyprus from Turkey, in violation of the previous resolutions. 

The Council then called on other Member States not to recognise the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), condemning the exchange of ambassadors between [[Turkey]] and Northern Cyprus and considering all attempts to interfere with the [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus]] contrary to Security Council resolutions. Finally, the resolution also called for the [[Secretary-General]] to promote the implementation of the current resolution.

The resolution was adopted by 13 votes to one against ([[Pakistan]]) and one abstention from the United States.

Blasko,  Diana Januauskiene, p. 97]&lt;/ref&gt; was a pro-Moscow and anti-[[Sąjūdis]] movement in the [[Lithuanian SSR]] during the [[Perestroika]] era. The goals of the movement were similar to those of the [[International Front of the Working People of Latvia|Latvian]] and [[Intermovement|Estonian]] [[Interfront|Internationalist Movements]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UJMzpeUHkQcC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=lithuania+yedinstvo&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES Taming nationalism? by Dovile Budryte, p. 55]&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. opposition to [[disintegration of the Soviet Union]]. Yedinstvo was supported by the Soviet military and the [[KGB]].

In addition to ethic Russians, the organization had some success among the [[Polish minority in Lithuania]], many{{specify|date=September 2016}} of whom preferred Lithuania as a member of the Soviet Union. Yedinstvo went as far as to support forming a [[Polish National-Territorial Region|Polish autonomous region]] in southeastern Lithuania.&lt;ref name=mgb/&gt; Some commentators suggested that the organization was more popular with the Polish minority than the Russophone minority of Lithuania,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=CMDqCL_rEPgC&amp;pg=PA253&lt;/ref&gt; which might have surprised the Poles of Warsaw, then seeking a de-communization in Poland. At the election to the Soviet [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]], two Poles were elected to that body, both pro-Moscow.

The movement lost influence after the abortive [[August coup]] that its leaders had supported. Since 1991, the organization has been inactive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JtxHWKJOBN4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA238&amp;dq=lithuania+yedinstvo&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES Ethnicity and electoral politics by Jóhanna Kristín Birnir, p. 238]&lt;/ref&gt;
