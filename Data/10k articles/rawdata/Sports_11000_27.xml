'''Banner Island Ballpark''' is a [[baseball]] [[stadium]] located in [[Stockton, California]], which seats 5,200&amp;nbsp;people with 4,200&amp;nbsp;fixed seats.&lt;ref name="spbib"/&gt; It is the home field of the [[Stockton Ports]], a [[minor league baseball|minor league]] affiliate of the [[Oakland Athletics]] in the Class A [[California League]].

==History==
The $22 million Banner Island Ballpark opened with a baseball game on April 28, 2005, during which the Stockton Ports defeated the [[San Jose Giants]], 7–4, in front of a sellout crowd of 5,287&amp;nbsp;fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Time to Play Ball|first=Jagdip|last=Dhillon|url=http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050428/SPORTS/504280314|newspaper=[[The Record (Stockton)]]|date=April 28, 2005|accessdate=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Banner Ballpark|first=Ross|last=McKeon|url=http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/A-Banner-Ballpark-Stockton-s-cozy-new-stadium-2638147.php|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=April 30, 2005|accessdate=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ballpark is a part of a revitalization project for the Downtown Stockton waterfront. It was built concurrently with the [[Stockton Arena]] and will be integrated with a waterfront park.

The Banner Island area is also the purported home of a previous Stockton baseball team that played in the late 1800s. Local residents claim that the team was the inspiration for the Mudville Nine in "[[Casey at the Bat]]", a poem by [[Ernest Thayer]]. Before moving to the ballpark, the Stockton Ports were known as the Mudville Nine during the 2000 and 2001 seasons.

==Name==
[[File:BIBEntrance.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Ballpark Entrance; note the signage that says "Stockton Ballpark"]]
The name "Banner Island Ballpark" is actually an unofficial name that is used among fans and the administration of the Stockton Ports. The City of Stockton owns the naming rights of the ballpark and until the rights are sold the stadium is officially known as '''Stockton Ballpark'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Banner Island Ballpark |first=Joe |last=Mock |url=http://www.baseballparks.com/stockton.asp |work=Baseball Parks |accessdate=March 4, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116212238/http://www.baseballparks.com/Stockton.asp |archivedate=November 16, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ballpark gets its unofficial name from the area in which it is located, Banner Island. This was once an island in the [[San Joaquin River]] [[river delta|delta]], noted during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] for the huge "Stars and Stripes" posted by a Union supporter. In time the island was connected to the mainland through [[land reclamation|land fill]] and only the southern shore remains. Despite the fact the area is no longer an island, the Banner Island name has stuck.

The '''College World Series Most Outstanding Player''' is an award for the best individual performance during the [[College World Series]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. The recipient of the award is announced at the completion of the College World Series Championship Game. The award is similar to [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[World Series MVP|World Series Most Valuable Player]] award.

Since 1999, the winner of the award has received a miniature replica of "The Road to Omaha" sculpture, which is situated at [[TD Ameritrade Park Omaha]]. The award measures 16 inches high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwsomaha.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58583&amp;Itemid=252]&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been 10 recipients of this award who were on not on the winning team of the College World Series.  The College World Series started in 1947 but the award was not given out until 1949.

==Voting process==
The press attending the championship series vote on the Most Outstanding Player during the game. In the fifth inning, ballots are distributed. The voting is closed by the eighth inning. The Most Outstanding Player is announced following the awarding of trophies to the runner-up and championship teams. If a third game of the championship series is necessary, the ballots taken during the second game are discarded, and a new round of balloting is conducted during the third and deciding game.

The fixture between [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgårdens IF]] and [[Hammarby Fotboll|Hammarby IF]] is a [[local derby]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. This important football [[List of association football club rivalries by country|rivalry]] traces its origin back to the later half of the 1910s{{cn|date=August 2017}} but did not reach relevance until the 1950s and 60s.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

There is a certain social aspect in the Hammarby - Djurgården rivalry. Hammarby consider [[Södermalm]], the southern, originally working-class, district of [[Stockholm City Centre]] where the club was founded, as well as the [[Söderort|boroughs just south of said district]], their heartland. Djurgården counts the affluent [[Östermalm]], the district that forms the eastern part of the [[Stockholm City Centre|city centre]], and where their former home ground [[Stockholms Stadion|Stadion]] is situated, as their stronghold. (Both clubs also maintain a cross-town rivalry with [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]], whose stronghold is the northwestern [[Stockholm urban area]], where their home ground is situated.)

The two teams did not meet for five years (2010-2014) when Hammarby played in the second tier [[Superettan]] with Djurgården remaining in Allsvenskan. In 2013, both Djurgården and Hammarby moved into the newly built [[Tele2 Arena]] located in [[Johanneshov]], just south of the city centre. This increased tensions significantly between the two sets of fans. 

Since the return of Hammarby to the Swedish first tier, [[Allsvenskan]] in 2015, Djurgården has so far recorded six losses, two draws, but not a single win against Hammarby, in spite of an overall superior performance in the league. A similar dismal performance in the [[Tvillingderbyt | Djurgården – AIK Derby rivalry]] since 2011 was broken only in the [[Svenska cupen]] quarter final in March 2018. This has generated an infected debate among Djurgården fans about the team being affected by a Derby’s Curse (“Derbyspöket”, literally “The Derby ghost”).

'''Elle''' is a very popular Sri Lankan [[Bat-and-ball games|bat-and-ball game]], often played in rural villages and urban areas.involves a hitter, a pitcher and fielders. The hitter is given three chances to hit the ball pitched at him or her. Once the hitter hits the ball with the bat - often a sturdy [[bamboo]] stick, the hitter has to complete a round or run which includes about four possible "stoppings" spaced 55 meters apart. A strikeout happens if the hitter's ball is caught by the fielding side or if the fielding side is able to hit the hitter with the ball while he or she is in the course of completing a run. The hitter can stop only at one of the three stoppings in the round thereby paving the way for another member of his team to come and become the hitter. The side that gets the highest number of (complete) runs wins the match.

== History ==
Historians predict the game existed from around the 20th century and it is not clear by whom the Historigame of elle was introduced to Sri Lanka. Even though one cannot find definitive sources on the origin of the sport, there is evidence to suggest that the game predates the 20th century. The sport of elle in Sri Lanka goes back to more than two thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ellesrilanka.blogspot.com|title=Sri Lanka Elle එල්ලේ|website=ellesrilanka.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is played among villagers during their free time in the evenings after work and especially close to the new year season; it was an interesting and competitive sport for the average person.
[[File:Jude8.JPG|thumb|එල්ලේ පන්දුවට පහරදිම]]
Simple yet sturdy sticks made the early bat while the improvised ball was sometimes a dried fruit of wel kaduru (''[[Cerbera manghas]]''). After reaping the harvest from their hard worked paddy fields farmers would gather together with their families by the now barren fields and play elle to celebrate the joy of a well earned break.
[[File:Jude1.JPG|right|thumb|එල්ලේ පන්දුවට පහරදිම]]

An elle game was a communal activity enjoyed by the whole village, young and old, male and female alike. It was a time to enjoy, laugh and cheer on your loved ones and neighbors as the whole village would break into teams and play the game as a tournament. Elle would also be played as regional tournaments where teams representing adjacent villages or towns would battle to win the title of best elle team. This would gradually spread to national level championships played with good cheer.

== Play ==
In a match, the maximum number of players in a team is sixteen with the minimum being twelve. The team with the lesser number would not usually call for the excess number of players to be removed from the opposing team. Instead the additional players in the larger team could be included in the line up prior to the commencement of the third innings. Striking or fielding could be decided upon by the [[Coin flipping|toss of a coin]]

== Elle ground ==
The playing area should be without obstructions especially to the running area. It should have an identical distance to the front and the two sides. The playing area should be marked with a line of 3 centimeters in breadth leaving at least five meters to the back of the striking spot.

Note: For matches played by school children the running distance between the bases would be less. Accordingly, for school matches the distance would be 11&amp;nbsp;m whereas for other matches arranged at sports society levels the distance would be 12&amp;nbsp;m.

== Materials ==
Equipment used in the playing area:

Two posts ten meters in height similar to a bamboo tree, six posts two centimeters in breadth and one meter in height and eight flags to be tied to the end of the posts. (The height of posts from ground level should be 1 meter.)

=== Elle bat ===
[[File:Jude1e.JPG|thumb|ප්‍රථමයෙන් භාවිතා කරන ලද පොල්පිත්ත]]
The elle bat should be made out from well seasoned bamboo and the length and breadth of the bat can be in accordance with the requirements of the striker. Its circumference should not be changed under any circumstances. However, the elle bat could be bound with material without using any metal in order to protect it from breaking or being damaged.

=== Elle ball ===
Until such time as a special ball is specifically made for elle, [[tennis ball]]s are used. The fur on the ball could be removed/shaved before use but removing of fur to make the rubber visible is strictly prohibited. A rubber ball or another light ball could be used instead of a tennis ball, but it is of paramount importance that the ball used should be common to both teams.

The '''Estadio BBVA Bancomer''', nicknamed "El Gigante de Acero" (Spanish for "The Steel Giant"), is a stadium developed by [[FEMSA]] and [[C.F. Monterrey]] in [[Guadalupe, Nuevo León|Guadalupe]], [[Monterrey Metropolitan area|Greater Monterrey]]. The stadium replaced the [[Estadio Tecnológico]] as the home of Monterrey, ending 63 years of residency at that stadium. The project was met with much controversy, stemming from multiple accusations of the construction as an apparent impediment to wildlife growth on a local scale.{{Why|date=June 2018}} &lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/mexico/es/Noticias/2011/Octubre/No-acaben-con-el-ultimo-pulmon-de-Monterrey-ONG/&lt;/ref&gt; It was inaugurated on 2 August 2015 with the eighth edition of the [[Eusébio Cup]], where Monterrey defeated [[S.L.

The '''European Athlete of the Year Trophy''' is an [[Athlete of the Year|annual prize]] awarded to sportspeople participating in [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], including [[track and field]], [[road running]] and [[cross country running]] competitions. The election has been organised by the European governing body for the sport of athletics, the [[European Athletic Association]] (EAA), since [[1993 in sports|1993]].

Each year, a [[shortlist]] is created by selecting the top European athlete in each event, based upon performances at the year's major championships. Only in exceptional circumstances will more than one athlete be shortlisted per event. Athletes who have served a [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping ban]] of two years or more are ineligible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.european-athletics.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=7754&amp;Itemid=2 European Athlete of the Year Award nominations for 2009].

Retrieved on 2009-10-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Via the EAA website, fans, media and members of the EAA federations are allowed to vote for five male and five female athletes on the list, with athletes receiving one to five points based on their ranking. A panel of experts also cast their votes. The votes of each of the four groups comprises 25% of the athletes' total scores, and the male and female athletes with the highest combined points totals win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:siJDvGCB6LAJ:www.european-athletics.com/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26task%3Dview%26id%3D5561%26Itemid%3D2+European+Athletics+Rising+Star&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk&amp;client=firefox-a European Athletics Rising Star Awards nominations for 2009 ].

As the governing body of [[association football]], [[FIFA]] is responsible for maintaining and implementing the rules that determine whether an association football player is eligible to represent a particular country in officially recognised international [[Association football#International competitions|competitions]] and [[friendly match]]es. In the 20th century, FIFA allowed a player to represent any national team, as long as the player held citizenship of that country. In 2004, in reaction to the growing trend towards naturalisation of foreign players in some countries, FIFA implemented a significant new ruling that requires a player to demonstrate a "clear connection" to any country they wish to represent. FIFA has used its authority to overturn results of competitive international matches that feature ineligible players.

FIFA's eligibility rules also demand that in men's competitions, only men are eligible to play, and that in women's competitions, only women are eligible to play.

==History==
[[File:Puskasreal.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ferenc Puskás]] represented both [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] (85 caps) and [[Spain national football team|Spain]] (4 caps)]]
Historically, it was possible for players to play for different national teams. For example, [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]] played for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] (1947) and [[Spain national football team|Spain]] (1957–61).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/distefano-intl.html|title=Alfredo Di Stéfano Laulhé - International Matches|accessdate=2 September 2016|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Di Stefano's Real Madrid teammate [[Ferenc Puskás]] also played for Spain after amassing 85 [[Cap (sport)|cap]]s for [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] earlier in his career.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-383600/Mottys-50-World-Cup-greats-Ferenc-Puskas.html|title=Motty's 50 World Cup greats: Ferenc Puskas|date=25 April 2006|accessdate=27 July 2011|publisher=''[[The Daily Mail]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third high-profile instance of a player switching international football nationalities is [[Jose Altafini]], who played for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] and for [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the subsequent [[1962 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=

Other 20th-century examples of players representing two or three separate countries are:

* [[José Santamaría]] – ([[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] and Spain)&lt;ref name=rsssf1/&gt;
* [[Alberto Spencer]] – ([[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] and Uruguay)&lt;ref name=rsssf1/&gt;

This does not include the hundreds of players whose teams were affected by changes to geopolitical borders e.g. [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]]/[[Germany national football team|Germany]], [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]]/[[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]/[[Croatia national football team|Croatia]].

Furthermore, some international players have played for another FIFA-recognised country in unofficial international matches, i.e. fixtures not recognised by FIFA as full internationals. This category includes [[Daniel Brailovsky]] who played for [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] youth teams, was featured in camps for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and years later officially represented [[Israel national football team|Israel]]; [[England national football team|England]] international [[Gordon Hodgson]], who has an amateur cap for [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]],&lt;ref name=rsssf1/&gt; and the aforementioned di Stefano, who also has four caps for [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]]. These caps are not officially recognised due to a dispute between FIFA and the [[Colombian Football Federation]] at the time.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/apr/05/theknowledge.sport|title=Players who have been capped by more than one country|date=5 April 2006|accessdate=27 July 2011|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern changes==
[[File:Sone Aluko 1.png|thumb|left|[[Sone Aluko]] originally represented [[England national under-19 football team|England]] at youth international level, before going on to represent [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] at senior international level]]

In January 2004, a new ruling came into effect that permitted a player to represent one country at youth international level and another at senior international level, provided that the player applied before their 21st birthday.&lt;ref name=chassoc /&gt; The first player to do so was [[Antar Yahia]], who played for the [[France national under-18 football team|France under-18s]] before representing [[Algeria national under-23 football team|Algeria]] in qualifiers for the [[2004 Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/3365795.stm|title=French-born Algerian makes history|date=3 January 2004|accessdate=28 July 2011|publisher=''[[BBC Sport]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent examples include [[Sone Aluko]], who has caps for the [[England national under-19 football team|England under-19s]] and [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/8068814.stm|title=Kelvin Etuhu opts for Nigeria |date=26 May 2009|accessdate=27 July 2011|publisher=''[[BBC Sport]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andrew Driver]], a former [[England national under-21 team|England under-21]] representative who is committed to the Scotland national team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/more-scottish-football/craig-levein-convinces-hearts-winger-andrew-driver-to-commit-his-international-future-to-scotland-1.1003905|title=Craig Levein convinces Hearts winger Andrew Driver to commit his international future to Scotland|date=5 February 2010|accessdate=27 July 2011|publisher=''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2004, FIFA amended its wider policy on international eligibility. This was reported to be in response to a growing trend in some countries, such as [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]] and [[Togo national football team|Togo]], to naturalise players born and raised in Brazil (and elsewhere) that have no apparent ancestral links to their new country of citizenship.&lt;ref name="Fifa rules on eligibility"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/3523266.stm|title=Fifa rules on eligibility|date=18 March 2004|accessdate=12 February 2015|publisher=''[[BBC Sport]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An emergency FIFA committee ruling judged that players must be able to demonstrate a "clear connection" to a country that they had not been born in but wished to represent. This ruling explicitly stated that, in such scenarios, the player must have at least one parent or grandparent who was born in that country, or the player must have been resident in that country for at least two years.&lt;ref name="Fifa rules on eligibility"/&gt;

[[File:Togo-nationalmannschaft.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Togo national football team|Togo]]'s registration of [[Naturalization|naturalised]] players born and raised in Brazil reportedly influenced FIFA's decision to amend eligibility rules in 2004.]]
In November 2007, FIFA President [[Sepp Blatter]] told the BBC: "If we don't stop this farce, if we don't take care about the invaders from Brazil towards Europe, Asia and Africa then, in the 2014 or the 2018 World Cup, out of the 32 teams you will have 16 full of Brazilian players."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blatter wants EU to allow quotas|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7112767.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 December 2012|date=26 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The residency requirement for players lacking birth or ancestral connections with a specific country was extended from two to five years in May 2008 at FIFA's Congress as part of Blatter's efforts to preserve the integrity of competitions involving national teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://redsports.sg/2008/11/27/qiu-li-football/|title=National footballer Qiu Li gets tackled from behind by new FIFA law|date=27 November 2008|accessdate=4 May 2012|publisher=''redsports.sg''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevant current FIFA statute, ''Article 7: Acquisition of a new nationality'', states:&lt;ref name="statutes"&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA Statutes (April 2016)|url=http://resources.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/02/78/29/07/fifastatutsweben_neutral.pdf|publisher=[[FIFA.com]]|accessdate=13 November  2017|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Diego Costa 2014.jpg|thumb|left|[[Diego Costa]] played two friendlies for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in 2013, before switching allegiances to [[Spain national football team|Spain]]]]
Under the criteria generally, it is possible for a player to have a choice of representing several national teams. It is not uncommon for national team managers and scouts to attempt to persuade players to change their FIFA nationality; in June 2011, for example, Scotland manager [[Craig Levein]] confirmed that his colleagues had started a dialogue with [[United States men's national under-17 soccer team|United States under-17]] international [[Jack McBean]] in an attempt to persuade him to represent Scotland in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/scotland/2011/06/12/craig-levein-wants-us-hitkid-jack-mcbean-to-play-for-scotland-86908-23196390/ |title=Craig Levein wants US hitkid Jack McBean to play for Scotland |publisher=''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|The Sunday Mail]]'' |date=12 June 2011 |accessdate=4 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819022544/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/scotland/2011/06/12/craig-levein-wants-us-hitkid-jack-mcbean-to-play-for-scotland-86908-23196390/ |archivedate=19 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gareth Bale]] was asked about a possibility to play for [[England national football team|England]], being of English descent through his grandmother, but ultimately opted to represent [[Wales national football team|Wales]], his country of birth.&lt;ref name="england"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-472869/Bale-I-played-England-playing-Wales-honour.html|title=Bale: I could have played for England but playing for Wales is an honour|publisher=Associated Newspapers|work=Mail Online|date=3 August 2007|accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, FIFA Congress passed a motion that removed the age limit for players who had already played for a country's national team at youth level to change national associations. This ruling features in Article 18 of the ''Regulations Governing the Application of the FIFA Statutes''.&lt;ref name=chassoc&gt;{{cite news|title=Protect the game, protect the players, strengthen global football governance # Change of association

Friendly match appearances do not commit a player to one country; [[Jermaine Jones]] played several friendlies for Germany but made his debut for the United States in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/09/jermaine-jones-in-u-s-lineup-against-poland/|title=Jermaine Jones Starts for U.S. Against Poland|date=9 October 2010|accessdate= 15 August 2018|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thiago Motta]] has three caps for Brazil in matches deemed friendlies for Brazil (participation in the CONCACAF Gold Cup as a non-conference guest team) and now represents Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11860_6736994,00.html|title=Motta given green light: Fifa happy for Inter midfielder to make Azzurri bow|date=7 February 2011|accessdate=31 July 2011|publisher=''[[Sky Sports]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diego Costa]] represented [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in 2 friendlies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/match/105428/italy-vs-brazil/report|title=Italy 2–2 Brazil: Balotelli beauty ensures Swiss spectacular ends all-square|publisher=Goal.com|date=21 March 2013|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Webber|first1=Tom|title=Brazil 1–1 Russia|url=http://www.goal.com/brasilglobaltour/en/match/brazil-vs-russia/1436910/live-commentary|accessdate=22 August 2014|work=Goal.com|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; before switching his allegiances to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in 2013,&lt;ref name=negocia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2013/09/25/seleccion/1380129055_899810.html|title=La FEF ya negocia la llamada de Diego Costa a la Selección|trans-title=FEF in negotiations to call Diego Costa to national team|publisher=Diario AS|language=Spanish|date=25 September 2013|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24734450|title=Diego Costa: Brazil-born striker commits to Spain|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 October 2013|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; going on to represent the latter at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]s.

===Penalties for playing ineligible players===
[[File:George Mourad1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Syria national football team|Syria]] were expelled from the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] process by FIFA in 2011, for fielding [[George Mourad]] in a senior qualification match against [[Tajikistan national football team|Tajikistan]]]]
FIFA takes punitive action against teams that field ineligible players. In August 2011, FIFA expelled [[Syria national football team|Syria]] from the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] process following the appearance of [[George Mourad]] in a senior qualification match against [[Tajikistan national football team|Tajikistan]]. Mourad had made friendly match appearances for [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] earlier in his career, but had not requested permission from FIFA to change national associations before playing for Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/sports/2011/08/26/asian-soccer-struggles-with-off-field-controversy/|title=Asian soccer struggles with off-field controversy|date=26 August 2011|accessdate=26 August 2011|publisher=''[[Fox News]]''|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509201544/http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/sports/2011/08/26/asian-soccer-struggles-with-off-field-controversy/|archivedate=9 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Men's Football at the 2015 Pacific Games|the men's football tournament]] at the [[2015 Pacific Games]], which also determines the 2016 Oceania Olympic Football qualifier, [[Deklan Wynne]], who was born in South Africa and raised in New Zealand from early childhood, played in the semi-final for New Zealand, who won the match 3-0. After the game, a protest was lodged by their opponents Vanuatu, on the basis that Wynne was not an eligible player. As Wynne was 20 years old, it was impossible for him to have already lived in New Zealand for five years after the age of 18. This protest was upheld by the [[Oceania Football Confederation]], resulting in New Zealand being disqualified and Vanuatu taking their place in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/12/new-zealands-olympic-football-place-in-jeopardy|title=New Zealand thrown out of Olympic qualifying after fielding ineligible player|agency=Australian Associated Press|date=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|2018 World Cup qualifiers]] [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] fielded [[Paraguay|Paraguayan]] born [[Nelson David Cabrera]] (who had also played for Paraguay) in two matches - against Peru on 1 September 2016 (the match was won 2:0 by Bolivia) and against Chile on 6 September 2016 (the match finished in a scoreless draw). Cabrera was subsequently found to be ineligible by FIFA, which resulted in the awarding of 3:0 wins for Bolivia's opponents, affecting the final standings in the table and contributing to Peru's qualification for the World Cup at the expense of Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2016/m=11/news=bolivia-sanctioned-for-fielding-ineligible-player-2847422.html|title=Bolivia sanctioned for fielding ineligible player|last=FIFA.com|date=2016-11-01|newspaper=FIFA.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nations that share a common nationality==

There are 25 FIFA member associations that share a common nationality with at least one other FIFA member association.&lt;ref name="FIFA Transfer Commentary"&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA Transfer Commentary|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/51/56/07/transfer_commentary_06_en_1843.pdf|publisher=FIFA.com|accessdate=7 October 2013|format=pdf|date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In these instances, under Article 6.1 of the Regulations Governing the Applications of Statutes, FIFA Statutes, (Nationality entitling Players to represent more than one Association), if a player was not born in the member associations' territory and does not have a parental or grand-parental blood relative that were born in the territory, the player is able to represent another member association that shares the same common nationality after two years residency.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Home nations agreement==

Due to the [[United Kingdom]]'s position in world football as a sovereign state that has four national teams, there has been a series of additional agreements between national football associations of the United Kingdom; England ([[The Football Association|FA]]), Scotland ([[Scottish Football Association|SFA]]), Wales ([[Football Association of Wales|FAW]]) and Northern Ireland ([[Irish Football Association|IFA]]). The latest agreement came in 2010 and was ratified by [[FIFA]].&lt;ref name="sfa-2010-6-9"&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA approve eligibility rule change|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_fa_news.cfm?page=2986&amp;newsCategoryID=3&amp;newsID=5968|publisher=ScottishFA.co.uk|accessdate=19 February 2014|date=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, [[Nigel Spackman]] wanted to be called up by Scotland during his time at [[Rangers F.C.]] through his Scottish grandfather. However at the time, the four British Associations did not choose to accept players without parents pertaining to the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bruce wants to join the foreign legion|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/bruce-wants-to-join-the-foreign-legion-1.594386|publisher=Herald|accessdate=7 October 2013|date=19 January 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' reported that "until recently that would have been enough to give him qualification to play for Scotland. But under an agreement by the four home associations it is not enough any more."

===Foreign-born British nationals===

The agreement is often erroneously thought to be a response to cases similar to [[Maik Taylor]], who was born in Germany to an English father and chose to represent [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] at international level despite having no ties to the nation. Taylor was called up to Northern Ireland in 1998, five years after the 1993 (gentlemen's) agreement was in place. The agreement was not applied when Taylor was called up by the IFA, possibly because in his case, neither the FA, SFA nor FAW was interested in capping him, unlike eg David Johnson (below) and so raised no objection. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Taylor was eligible to play for Northern Ireland due to FIFA regulations allowing him to. The relevant statute of the time read: "Any player who is a naturalised citizen of a country in virtue of that country’s laws shall be eligible to play for a national or representative team of that country." As there is no United Kingdom national team, he was eligible to choose a "representative team of the country" and opted for Northern Ireland. Players in the same situation today would only be allowed to represent the territory of their (grand)parent's birthplace as the clause has been amended to refer to the Football Association's "territory" and not "country". {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===1993 agreement===

The four associations met on 27 February 1993 at [[Hanbury Manor]] in Hertfordshire. The [[Scottish Football Association]] (SFA) released minutes from the meeting to the press.

{{quotation|
On the occasion of the meeting of the International Football Association Board on February 27, 1993 the four British associations ratified the following agreement, which came into force on February 1, 1993, on the criteria which should determine the eligibility of the player to be selected for one of the national teams of the British associations:

# His country of birth.
# The country of birth of his natural mother or father.
# The country of birth of his natural grandmother or grandfather.
# Where the player, both natural parents, and both natural grandparents are born outside the UK, but the player is the holder of a current British passport, he may play for the country of his choice."&lt;ref name="scottish-no-go"&gt;{{cite web|title=Johnson devastated at Scottish no-go|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/scottish/johonson-devastated-at-scottish-nogo-742830.html|publisher= |work=The Independent|accessdate=7 October 2013 |date=4 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Scottish Football Association}}

[[David Johnson (footballer, born 1976)|David Johnson]] was a [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]]n international who had played four games for the Caribbean nation, his most recent games was a friendly against United States on 9 September 1999. He had previously played for the England B team and had been an unused substitute for the England under-21s. In late September 1999, the [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] forward was called up by Wales (and withdrew from the squad due to injury) and later Scotland. The Welsh and Scottish FAs believed he was eligible to play for them.&lt;ref name="scottish-no-go"/&gt; Johnson was a Jamaican immigrant who was raised by foster parents in England, and he believed he could choose which UK nation to represent, the (English) Football Association (FA) had advised the player's [[sports agent|agent]] that the international change of allegiance could go ahead.&lt;ref name="here-to-paternity"&gt;{{cite web|title=Not quite from here to paternity|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/not-quite-from-here-to-paternity-1.265864|publisher=Herald|accessdate=7 October 2013|date=25 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the SFA discovered that as he had an English mother, he was not able to represent any Home nation other than England as a result.&lt;ref name="scottish-no-go"/&gt; The SFA had chosen to abide by the agreement, unlike the Irish Football Association (IFA), who in addition to courting David Johnson had capped Germany-born [[Maik Taylor]] the previous year. Taylor was in the same situation as Johnson, he was born outside of the UK with one English parent. The Herald reported that: "It is important to highlight, that under the agreement signed by the four British associations, the UK passport clause is only operative in the event that the player, his natural mother and father and his natural grandparents, are all born outside the United Kingdom." &lt;ref name="here-to-paternity"/&gt;

A Football Association of Wales (FAW) spokesman Cerri Stennett said that they were "extremely puzzled by this development" and they thought "he was eligible to play for any of the four home countries and that's why Lawrie McMenemy wanted him for Northern Ireland as well." Stennett stated that FIFA gave clearance to Johnson switch allegiance to Wales' national squad and "he was on the substitute's bench for a match."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ipswich attack 'charade' as Johnson is ruled to be English; Coach faces up to the reality that he will be unable to name Jamaican in his squad|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23768868.html|publisher=The Herald {{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}}|accessdate=19 February 2014|date=5 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in January 2000, Craig Brown clarified issues
"I was told by FIFA that David Johnson was totally eligible and twice I called his club manager [[George Burley]] and he told me he was totally eligible. But I was assuming that FIFA were aware of our home countries agreement and apparently they weren't. I did not think I could get any higher authority than FIFA so if we play David Johnson tomorrow they would not complain and if we played him at Wembley, there would not have been a problem with FIFA. But there was the agreement with the four nations." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Gentlemen Became Rogues over Agreement|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-109641746.html|publisher=The Mail on Sunday|accessdate=19 February 2014|date=2 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Lawrie McMenemy]]'s stewardship, Northern Ireland went through a phase of trying to call-up players who had no links to a UK nation, Northern Ireland attempted to call up Germany-born Maik Taylor, Nigeria-born [[Dele Adebola]] and Jamaica-born David Johnson. McMenemy's successor [[Sammy McIlroy]] was not pleased with his predecessor's policy, upon being appointed as Northern Ireland manager he said: "It's farcical chasing players with absolutely no connection to our country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Bill |title=Mac the knife |publisher=Trinity Mirror |work=Sunday Mirror |date=9 January 2000 |accessdate=27 March 2014 |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FOOTBALL%3A+MAC+THE+KNIFE%3B+Sammy+slams+foreign+legion.-a060959897 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former FA executive [[David Davies (football administrator)|David Davies]] confirmed that England had once considered calling up Italian [[Carlo Cudicini]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carlo for England?|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/news/2003/38978 |publisher= |work=www.thefa.com |accessdate=14 November 2012|date=7 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian [[Edu Gaspar|Edu]] and Frenchmen [[Steed Malbranque]] and [[Louis Saha]] during [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]]'s time as England manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Davies: Sex, drugs and penalties in the Eriksson era |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1064481/EXCLUSIVE-David-Davies-sex-drugs-penalties-Eriksson-era.html |publisher= |work=Daily Mail |accessdate=14 November 2012|date=30 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2004, there was a lot of media speculation in Scotland about the possibility of Frenchman [[Didier Agathe]] and Italian [[Lorenzo Amoruso]] playing for Scotland. [[Berti Vogts]], the German head coach of Scotland, appeared to be in favour of fielding the players. Scotland's playing captain [[Christian Dailly]] felt differently, telling the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' newspaper that "I don't care if they call in [[Zinedine Zidane]]. I would rather lose with a team of Scots than win with a team of foreigners. This is not a club side we're talking about it's SCOTLAND...I know the players will definitely be against it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |last=Jackson |first=Keith |title=I don't care if we bring in Zidane...

Ahead of a meeting with the other home associations, SFA executive [[David Taylor (executive)|David Taylor]] urged caution ahead of calls to opt out of the agreement, he said: "We have to watch it does not become a free-for-all with the home countries trying to get the best players available," "It goes to the heart of why we exist as a separate country and could force people into asking why we do not have a UK football team." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |last=Broadfoot |first=Darryl |title=National side at mercy of FIFA proposals Eligibility issue to be decided by home nations pact |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/national-side-at-mercy-of-fifa-proposals-eligibility-issue-to-be-decided-by-home-nations-pact-1.93183 |publisher=Herald &amp; Times Group |work=The Herald |accessdate=9 October 2013|date=18 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 2004, the four British associations voted to retain the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Broadfoot |first=Darryl |title=Identity crisis not much of a drama |publisher=Herald &amp; Times Group |work=The Herald|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23561873.html|date=2 March 2004|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 agreement===
In January 2006, Northern Ireland manager [[Lawrie Sanchez]] had his hopes of bringing in players born outside Northern Ireland – but who held a British passport – dashed. Irish FA chiefs told Sanchez he could only select players who have a history with Northern Ireland. Sanchez spoke of his frustration with the rule: "I must stick by the British agreement which says that you shouldn't approach a player unless he has family ties with that particular country.

"It's frustrating but my job is to manage the Northern Ireland international team and theirs (the [[Irish FA]]) is to make policy.

"I must continue to work with the players I have and I'm very happy to do that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/imported/quick-on-the-draw-28253118.html|title=Quick on the draw
|first=Paul|last=Ferguson|newspaper=Belfast Telegraphy (Sunday Life)|date=22 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wording of the agreement was adjusted and published by FIFA in December 2006:&lt;ref name="FIFA Transfer Commentary"/&gt;
{{quotation|
'''3. British associations'''

# There is a specific agreement, stipulating the conditions to play for a national team, for the four British associations&lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;. Besides having British nationality, the player needs to fulfil at least one of the following conditions
#:a) he was born on the territory of the relevant association;
#:b) his biological mother or father was born on the territory of the relevant association;
#:c) his grandmother or grandfather was born on the territory of the relevant association.
# If a player has a British passport, but no territorial relationship as provided for in conditions a-c above, he can choose for which of the British associations he wants to play&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;small&gt;134 England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
&lt;br /&gt;135 e.g. a player who was born on the Cayman Islands and holds British nationality&lt;/small&gt;}}

In October 2008, Spanish striker [[Nacho Novo]] said that he would apply for a British passport if it meant he'd become eligible to play for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. The SFA stated that he would not be eligible as they would abide by the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7702704.stm |date = 31 October 2008|publisher=BBC |work=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=23 December 2013 |title=Deal ends Novo's Scotland hopes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 agreement===

The agreement was completely revised in 2009 following a rewrite of the FIFA statutes in 2008. The loophole regarding British players born abroad and selecting a national team had been closed and then reopened. The revised ruling also removed the possibility of ineligibility due to a foreign-born adopted player having no parental or grand-parental links to a nation, as it is based on where the player is educated before the age of 18. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

;Removal of residency clause

The home nations have agreed to remove a clause that enables players to gain eligibility for one of the eight national teams due to residency. The FIFA statutes state that "Associations sharing a common nationality may make an agreement under which item (d) of par. 1 of this article is deleted completely or amended to specify a longer time limit". The clause removed is:

{{quote|(d) He has lived continuously on the territory of the relevant Association for at least two years|sign=FIFA Statutes (April 2016 edition)&lt;ref name="statutes"/&gt;}}

If the home nations' associations had chosen not to remove or alter the 'd' clause and instead use the default FIFA statute clauses, players with a home nation nationality would be able to transfer to a club in another home nation and be eligible for that national team after a period of two years (providing they have not been capped or played in an ''official'' competition for a nation).

; The education clause

In February 2009, the Scottish FA's Gordon Smith put forward a proposal that would allow players educated in the FA's territory who otherwise had no blood connections to the nation to become eligible to represent the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jardine|first=Peter|title=Exclusive: Smith's blueprint will open door to non-Scots playing for national team|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1156743/Exclusive-Smiths-blueprint-open-door-non-Scots-playing-national-team.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=14 November 2012|date=26 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule was ratified by FIFA in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shuttleworth|first=Peter|title=Shawcross now eligible for Wales|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/8302195.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 November 2012|date=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, FIFA approved a minor rewording of the criteria.&lt;ref name="sfa-2010-6-9"/&gt; The introduction of the new clause allows a player to gain eligibility for a British national team if he receives 5 years of education in the territory of the relevant association:

{{quote|d) He has engaged in a minimum of five years education under the age of 18 within the territory of the relevant association.|Home nations agreement}}

As a direct result of the clause change, England-born [[Andrew Driver]] became eligible to play for the Scotland national team in June 2012. Driver was initially only eligible to represent England's national team despite living in Scotland since the age of 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrew Driver receives Scotland eligibility boost|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/8731562.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andy Dorman]], who had previously been ineligible for Wales despite living in [[Hawarden]] for most of life became eligible to represent Wales. He was called up in November 2009 and made his début for Wales on 23 May 2010 against Montenegro at the [[Stadion Gradski (Nikšić)|Stadion Gradski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_of_wales/8678876.stm |title=Croatia 2–0 Wales |date=23 May 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2010 |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criteria for eligibility to represent a home nation is:

{{quotation|
#A Player who, under the terms of art. 5, is eligible to represent more than one Association on account of his nationality, may play in an international match for one of these Associations only if, in addition to having the relevant nationality, he fulfils at least one of the following conditions:
#:a) He was born on the territory of the relevant Association;
#:b) His biological mother or biological father was born on the territory of the relevant Association;
#:c) One of his biological grandparents was born on the territory of the relevant Association;
#:d) He has engaged in a minimum of five years education under the age of 18 within the territory of the relevant association.|Home nations agreement}}

In July 2012, the Football Association of Wales confirmed that [[Swansea City F.C.]]'s Spanish defender [[Àngel Rangel]] is not eligible to represent Wales due to the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swansea City defender Angel Rangel ineligible for Wales|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18833190|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 November 2012|date=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Ireland ==

Players born in [[Northern Ireland]] have a right by birth to  [[Irish nationality law|Irish]] and [[British nationality law|British]] citizenship which entitles them to be selected for the representative teams of the [[Irish Football Association]] (IFA - Northern Ireland) as well as of the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI - Republic of Ireland). In contrast, players born in the [[Republic of Ireland]] do not have such dual nationality from birth and, as a consequence, are confined to playing for the teams of the FAI and cannot play for Northern Ireland unless they have a parent or grandparent who was born there. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Players otherwise eligible for Northern Ireland do not need a UK passport if they have an Irish passport.&lt;ref name="ie20060620" /&gt; A 2006 FIFA decision to require a UK passport was reversed after a month of IFA protests, with intervention from [[Peter Hain]], the [[Northern Ireland Secretary]], and [[Dermot Ahern]], the Republic's [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Ireland)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref name="ii26386503"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/red-card-for-fifa-on-north-players-passports-26386503.html|title=Red card for FIFA on North players' passports -|last=McDermott|first=Gerry|date=26 May 2006|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ie20060620"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2006/0620/sport/fifa-scraps-aposstupidapos-north-passports-rule-6404.html|title=FIFA scraps ‘stupid’ North passports rule |last=O’Hare|first=Paul|date=20 June 2006|work=[[Irish Examiner]]|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotebox|''3. REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE STATUS AND TRANSFER OF PLAYERS'' 

In this connection, two points were raised from the national associations of Belgium and Northern Ireland: (…)

''b) Irish Football Association (Northern Ireland)''

The Committee considered this association’s statement that almost any player can obtain a Republic of Ireland passport in order to secure eligibility to play for this country.

The Committee discussed this very serious matter at length and had to come to the unfortunate conclusion that FIFA cannot interfere with the decisions taken by any country in the question of granting passports.

The only way that the national associations could prevent their nationals from being systematically granted passports by another country to enable them to play for its national teams would be to field them in an official match for one of their national representative teams, which would bind them to this particular association”

[[File:Daniel Kearns 30-05-2009 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Daniel Kearns (footballer)|Daniel Kearns]], who originally represented [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] at youth international level, chose to represent the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], despite the fact he had not lived in the Republic of Ireland, and had no parents or grandparents from the Republic of Ireland, causing the [[Irish Football Association]] (IFA) to contest his decision.&lt;ref name="cas"/&gt;]]
In 2009, [[Daniel Kearns (footballer)|Daniel Kearns]], who had represented Northern Ireland at youth level, declared for the Republic of Ireland. He was born in Belfast and his parents and grandparents were all from Northern Ireland. The IFA complained to FIFA that Kearns should be ineligible to represent the Republic of Ireland. FIFA responded: "As the FIFA Legal Committee understands it, the situation in Northern Ireland is such that all Northern Irish footballers could opt to play for your association teams, given that they have a birthright to an Irish passport. Evidently, the same is not applicable to the footballers of the Republic of Ireland, who do not have such a claim to a UK passport. This means that the [IFA] is exposed to a one-way situation, where players can choose to play for your association teams but the vice versa is not possible. This circumstance is rather unique and the FIFA Statutes and regulations do not provide for a solution".&lt;ref name="cas"/&gt;

In 2007, the FIFA Legal Committee invited the FAI voluntarily to confine itself to selecting for its association teams Northern Irish players who meet one of the following requirements: a) the player was born in the Republic of Ireland, b) his biological mother or father was born in the Republic of Ireland, c) his grandmother or grandfather was born in the Republic of Ireland, or d) he has lived continuously, for at least two years, in the Republic of Ireland.

FIFA also proposed an agreement between the Irish FA and the Football Association of Ireland which read:&lt;ref name="cas"/&gt;
:(…) every player born on the territory of Northern Ireland, holding the UK nationality and being entitled to a passport of the Republic of Ireland or born on the territory of the Republic of Ireland and holding the Irish nationality could either play for the [FAI] or the [IFA], under the condition that all other relevant prerequisites pertaining to player’s eligibility for a specific Association team are fulfilled

FAI favoured the proposal, the IFA did not. Following the IFA's rejection, FIFA told the IFA that they had "concluded to adhere to the status quo".&lt;ref name="cas"/&gt;

In 2010, the IFA challenged the FAI in the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS).&lt;ref name="cas"/&gt; CAS concluded that the Irish FA "cannot reasonably claim that Mr Kearns’ situation is to be equated with shared nationality as provided under Article 16 or that he requests a changed of association from a starting point of a shared nationality. His situation, with respect to his Irish nationality, is not governed by Article 16, but by the general principle set forth by Article 15 par. 1 of the said Regulations.

==Career==
Hamid Reza Sadr movie reviews are published in many Iranian journals since 1981 including ''Zan-e Rooz, Soroush'', ''Film Magazine'', ''Film International'', and ''Haft'' or Seven magazine. He has explained his critical approach to films as "relative, not unconditional"; he analysis a film for what he feels will be its likely audience, yet he usually approaches movies emotionally, with a strongly touching writing style. He was especially cruel to some films that had been roasted by many critics, such as [[Bahram Beizai]] and [[Masoud Kimiai]] films. The originality of his opinions, as well as the vigorous way in which he spoken them, won his eager supporters as well as angry critics.&lt;ref name="Goal.com 2013"&gt;{{cite web | title=به قلم حميدرضا صدر: ماهی های خشمگین این ظرف - Goal.com | website=Goal.com | date=February 24, 2013 | url=http://www.goal.com/iran/news/1825/%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86/2009/09/26/1523970/%D8%A8%D9%87-%D9%82%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%AD%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B6%D8%A7-%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%87%DB%8C-%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%AE%D8%B4%D9%85%DA%AF%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%B8%D8%B1%D9%81 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224113635/http://www.goal.com/iran/news/1825/%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86/2009/09/26/1523970/%D8%A8%D9%87-%D9%82%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%AD%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B6%D8%A7-%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%87%DB%8C-%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%AE%D8%B4%D9%85%DA%AF%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%B8%D8%B1%D9%81 | archive-date=February 24, 2013 | dead-url=unfit | language=fa | access-date=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He translated '''[[From Reverence to Rape: The Treatment of Women in the Movies]]"'', the influential book by [[Molly Haskell]] which published in ''Zan-e Rooz'' magazine.

He has  written a book on politics and Iranian cinema, called ''Iranian Cinema: A Political History''.&lt;ref name="Burke2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Andrew|title=Iran|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gEca_4iSNCUC&amp;pg=PA77|accessdate=28 September 2010|year=2008|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-293-1|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comprehensive analysis provided in this book gives refreshing, up-to-date introduction to those interested in Iranian cinema and its socio-political dimensions and history, observing recurrent themes and genres as well as giving lights to lesser-known thematic concerns and figures. Sadr, while acknowledging the lack of imaginative expression in mainstream Iranian cinema: the weak scripts, the poor performances, the repetitive and conservative nature and content and poor performances, argues for and analysis the political contexts and its constant shifts embedded within the apparently least noteworthy of Iranian films.

Sadr was known for his monthly column called "''Shadow of Imagination''" {سایه خیال} appearing in ''Film  Magazine'' and his reports on international film festival particularly on [[London Film Festival]]. He interviewed many famous actors, directors and film critics including: [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Mike Leigh]], [[Jim Jarmusch]], [[Carlos Saura]], [[Andrei Konchalovsky]], [[Peter Wollen]], [[Laura Mulvey]], [[Jeffrey Noel Smith]], [[John Gillett]], [[Sohrab Shahid-Sales]] and [[Farokh Ghafari]].

He is a co-producer of ''Looking for Scheherazade'' movie, a documentary directed by [[Safi Yazdanian]] in 2003.

He is a football lover and has written several features on sociology, politics and football. His book   ''Once Upon a Time Football'' is about politics and football but it also tells the story of the Sadr's relationship with football and sometimes relates them to his own personal life. It has been years now that he appears on the Iranian national television to talk about football matches and thus has become famous among people.

'''Hara Arena''' was a 5,500-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] located in the [[Dayton, Ohio]] suburb of [[Trotwood, Ohio|Trotwood]]. The facility began as a ballroom in 1956, added an arena in 1964 and grew to a six-building complex which closed in August 2016.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

At one time, it hosted the [[Dayton Jets]] [[basketball]] team and Dayton Gems ([[Dayton Gems|1964–1977, 1979–1980]] and [[Dayton Gems (2009–12)|2009–2012]]), Dayton Blue Hawks, [[Dayton Owls]], [[Dayton Bombers]], [[Dayton Ice Bandits]], [[Dayton Demonz]], Megacity Hockey Club and [[Dayton Demolition]] [[ice hockey]] teams and [[the Marshals (NIFL)|the Marshals]] [[indoor American football|indoor football]] team.

== History ==
The site was originally the family-owned fruit orchard of Harold and Ralph Wampler. The name stems from HA from Harold and RA from Ralph. In 1956, the Wampler Ballroom was erected, which still stands today in the six-building complex. The arena itself opened in 1964.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |archivedate= 2016-05-27 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160527192207/http://www.haracomplex.com/history |url= http://www.haracomplex.com/history |website= HaraComplex.com |title= History |accessdate= May 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original plans did not include an ice rink, but were changed to accommodate the Dayton Gems who were looking for a home arena. As of 2016, the complex spanned {{convert|165000|sqft|m2}} which includes the main arena, four exhibition halls, a conference center, a [[pub]] and a [[golf course]]. The Arena regularly used the slogan in advertising "Nowhere Else But Hara."&lt;ref name="worstof"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.xeniagazette.com/opinion/14890/visiting-the-worst-of-2016|title=Visiting the worst of 2016|first=Jim|last=Bucher|date=January 9, 2017|accessdate=March 22, 2018|publisher=''[[Xenia Daily Gazette]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2016, it was announced that the facility would close after hosting a final event August 27, 2016 due to ongoing financial issues and a 20-year long legal fight over the unresolved estate of founder Harold Wampler. At the time of the closure announcement, the facility  was said to have a $36 million annual impact to the area.&lt;ref name=closure&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.whio.com/news/business/hara-arena-to-close/nr66C/ |title= Hara Arena to Close |publisher= WHIO |date= July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wdtn.com/2016/07/29/hara-arena-to-shut-down/|title=Hara Arena closing its doors after 60 years|last=Staff|first=WDTN|date=2016-07-29|website=WDTN|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closure forced events, like the annual [[Dayton Hamvention]], to search for an alternative venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.whio.com/news/business/hamvention-to-find-new-home-after-hara-arena-annou/nr7C2/ |title= Hara Arena closing forces Hamvention to find new home |publisher= WHIO |date= July 29, 2016 |first= Cornelius |last= Frolik }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also forced the [[Dayton Demolition]] ice hockey team to cease operations after only one season.

As of March 2018, the property had been abandoned for over a year-and-a-half, at times vandalized and broken into. In December 2017, [[PNC Financial Services|PNC Bank]] foreclosed on the property, seeking to collect on $350,000 owed to the bank. It was reported that many had called Trotwood's government with ideas for the property, which had a list price of $775,000, but anyone seeking to acquire the property would need a "specific plan for the complicated situation of 'well over $1 million' in taxes that are due, and the multiple parcels of land and arena."&lt;ref name="debtlingers"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.whio.com/news/nearly-two-years-later-debt-back-taxes-linger-for-hara-arena-property/MYlGPcgM22dMdrgpqkdV4K/|title=Nearly two years later: Debt, back taxes linger for Hara Arena property|publisher=WHIO|first=Kaitlin|last=Schroeder|date=March 21, 2018|accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, [[YouTube]] video from a self-described "local explorer" illicitly entering the arena showed disrepair and deteriorating conditions. The city of Trotwood had made attempts to secure the property, but with limited success, and it was reported to have hundreds of code violations.&lt;ref name="youtube video"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.whio.com/news/hara-arena-deterioration-shown-new-video/8RVqPezUAk9UNGRHf6yFpI/|title=Hara Arena deterioration shown in new video|publisher=WHIO-TV|date=April 4, 2018|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2018, it was revealed that the property was purchased by Michael Heitz, a developer based in Louisville, Kentucky. Heitz stated that he had bought the income tax liens from Montgomery County and hoped to close on further liens with the banks later in the week. Heitz stated that his first priority was to clean up the site and secure the property.

== Professional wrestling ==
Hara was the scene every other Monday night in the 1960s and 1970s for the "Original" Big Time Wrestling, featuring such stars as the Sheik, Bobo Brazil, Fred and Bull Curry, Igor, Mark Lewin, Ox Baker, and many other wrestling stars. The ring announcer for most of the events was Les Pomervlle. Hara also hosted Georgia Championship Wrestling in 1983 and 1984.
It also hosted a [[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]] TV taping in March, 1987, a WWF [[Wrestling Challenge]] taping in August, 1988, and the Pay-Per-View events as follows: the 1995 WCW [[The Great American Bash (1995)|Great American Bash]], [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]]/NWO [[Souled Out (1998)]], and [[ECW Heat Wave#1998|ECW Heatwave 1998]] and [[ECW Heat Wave#1999|ECW Heatwave 1999]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016|reason=entire section is not cited}}

== Other events ==
[[File:DaytonHamvention2003.jpg|thumb|Interior of the arena during the 2003 Hamvention.]]
The arena was also venue to many types of concerts, music festivals, trade shows and conventions, formerly including the annual [[Dayton Hamvention]] (which, starting in 2017, will be held at the [[Greene County Fairgrounds and Expo Center]]). The [[Miami Valley]] Home Improvement Show was also held annually here.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; According to the [[American Radio Relay League]], the 2016 Hamvention had been the 65th held in Dayton and the Hara complex hosted more than 25,000 visitors in that final year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arrl.org/news/good-bye-hara-arena-hamvention-to-relocate-in-2017 |title= Good-Bye, Hara Arena! Hamvention to Relocate in 2017! |website= ARRL |date= July 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a 60-year history, the facility hosted many musical performances from bands ranging from the Rolling Stones and the Grateful Dead&lt;ref name=closure /&gt; to [[Guy Lombardo]] And His Royal Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guy Lombardo – October, 1976 Itinerary|url=http://www.guylombardomusic.com/lombardoitinerary76.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy metal band Pantera performed at the facility numerous times between the years of 1990-2001, and were officially named the house band of the venue in 1998.
&lt;!-- 
Over the extensive history of the facility from 1964 to 2016 it is largely pointless to attempt to create a list of bands that performed there.

'''Indian Ball''' is a "[[Bat-and-ball games|bat-and-ball]]" game featuring a [[baseball bat]] and [[Baseball (ball)|ball]]. The sport originated in  the late 40's in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] so that if 18 players weren't available to play a regular [[baseball game]] or a full sized field wasn't available they could play an alternate game much like baseball but for fewer players.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stlmag.com/What-the-Is-Indian-Ball/&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Rules==
Indian Ball is played in any size area from a regular baseball field to a side yard or street. The game can be played with any number of players from normally 1 to ten. A ball may be put into play in one of three different ways. Pitched by a teammate, side tossed by a teammate or tossed by the batter themselves. If the ball is put in play and hits or is touched by the pitcher it is an automatic out. Only infielders can field balls in the infield and only outfielders are allowed to field balls in the outfield. If in any case an infielder plays a ball in the outfield or an outfielder plays a ball in the infield it is an automatic double (two points).

==Rules==
3 strikes equals an out and 4 balls equals an out so that pace is sped up and the batter cannot wait around for a perfect pitch.
A ball that is caught by a player in all locations (fair, foul or deadzone) without hitting the ground results in an out. If a ball is hit in play in the infield and an infielder (regardless if it was touched or deflected off them or someone else) before it comes to a complete stop results in an out. If a ball is hit into or lands in the infield before the infielders get to it (regardless if it was touched or deflected of a player) results in a single (one point). A ball that is hit into the outfield (regardless of whether it is a grounder, line drive, or pop fly) but does not get behind an outfielder and is picked up by an outfielder before it comes to a stop (regardless of whether they or someone else touched it) it results in a single (1 Point). A ground ball that makes it into the outfield and is kept in front of an outfielder but is not picked up by the outfielder before it comes to a complete stop is a Double (2 Points). A fly ball that lands in the outfieldin front of an outfielder and is not picked up by an outfielder before it comes to a stop (but does not get behind an outfielder) is a Double (2 Point). A ball that lands in front of an outfielder and then gets behind that outfielder (regardless of whether the outfielders touched it or not) and is not picked up before it comes to a stop equals a Triple (3 Points).  A fly ball that lands in front of an outfielder and gets behind the outfielder and is not picked up
by an outfielder before it comes to a stop is a Triple (3 Points). A fly ball that lands behind an outfielder (no matter the distance behind) without being touched by that outfielder and is not picked up before it comes to a stop is a Home Run (4 Points). Points that result in a negative result are when returning the ball back to the next batter, if the infielder who fielded the ball (when throwing from the spot where they fielded the ball) hits the bat with the ball the score of the
batting team is reduced by one point (-1 Points). Another is When returning the ball back to the next batter, if the outfielder (when throwing from the spot where they fielded the ball) hits the bat with the ball the score of the batting team is reduced by
two points (-2 Points).

[[File:Likya yolus.jpg|thumb|275px|Trail signs on the Lycian Way.]]
'''Lycian Way Ultramarathon''' ({{lang-tr|Likya Yolu Ultramaratonu}}, shortly LYUM) is an international [[multiday race|multiday]] [[trail running]] [[ultramarathon]] event that takes place across the ancient [[Lycia]]n region in southwestern [[Turkey]]. The event is run around {{convert|220|-|240|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the {{convert|509|km|mi|abbr=on}} long historical [[Lycian Way]] eastwards from [[Fethiye]] to [[Antalya]] in six days. The elevation of the route varies between sea level and {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.likyayoluultramaratonu.com/TR/?page=rota-100 |publisher=Likya Yolu Ultramaratonu |title=Rota |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lyumh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.likyayoluultramaratonu.com/TR/?page=hakkinda-97 |publisher=Likya Yolu Ultramaratonu |title=Hakkında |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lycian Way Ultramarathon was established in 2010 taking place on October 11–17.&lt;ref name="lyum10"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.likyayoluultramaratonu.com/TR/?page=lyum-2010-53 |publisher=Likya Yolu Ultramaratonu |title=LYUM 2010 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changing ground conditions such as sandy and rocky trails, [[dirt road]]s, slippery terrain in conifer forests and steep slopes make the ultramarathon extremely difficult.&lt;ref name="lyumh"/&gt;

[[File:Map of Lycian way.jpg|thumb|275px|Map of the Lycian Way.]]
The route starts at [[Ölüdeniz]] in Fethiye district of [[Muğla Province]]. Following the [[Turkish Riviera]] coastline, it passes through [[List of Lycian place names|Sidyma]] and then in [[Antalya Province]] the places [[Kaş]], [[Kaleköy, Kaş|Simena]], [[Finike]], [[Olympos (Lycia)|Olympos]] and [[Phaselis]]. The race ends in [[Antalya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.likyayoluultramaratonu.com/images/slider_images/4.jpg |publisher=Likya Yolu Ultramaratonu |title=Route map |accessdate=2013-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth edition of the event in 2013 was cancelled because many foreign ultra runners stayed away or annulled their entry due to perceived risks in connection with the [[2013 protests in Turkey]] and [[2012 Syrian–Turkish border clashes]]. The cancellation caused reaction by local athletes, who had already arranged their training, holiday and airline tickets in accordance with the race term.&lt;ref name="h1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/24650585.asp |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=Likya Maratonu neden iptal edildi |author=Ataer, Kazım |date=2013-09-05 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The National Sports Journalism Center''' is a [[sports journalism]] program run by [[Indiana University]] and a resource center for sports media professionals. The center, based at [[Indiana University-Bloomington]], is partnered with the Media School at Indiana University, through which students can take degree programs in sports journalism and other forms of sports media.

The center, founded in early 2009, has hosted events on the Bloomington and Indianapolis campuses. It held its first event, a forum on the effects of hype and evolving media pressures on sports reporting, in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Hype and Media Pressure in the Sports Industry http://journalism.indiana.edu/news/sports-journalists-debate-effects-of-hype-evolving-media-pressures/&lt;/ref&gt; It held a second panel discussion on diversity in the sports media industry in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;"From the Press Box to the Locker Room: The Diversity Divide." http://sportsjournalism.org/sports-media-news/panel-sports-coverage-hurting-from-lack-of-diversity-in-newsrooms/&lt;/ref&gt; Additional speakers have included Fox sports commentator [[Joe Buck]] and Pulitzer Prize winner and "[[Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream|Friday Night Lights]]" author [[H.G.

'''Professional sports''', as opposed to [[amateur sports]], are [[sport|sports]] in which [[athlete|athletes]] receive [[payment]] for their performance.  Professional athleticism has come to the fore through a combination of developments. [[Mass media]] and increased [[leisure]] have brought larger audiences, so that sports organizations or teams can command large incomes.&lt;ref name="Sport &amp; the Extreme"/&gt; As a result, more [[athlete|sportspeople]] can afford to make athleticism their primary career, devoting the training time necessary to increase skills, physical condition, and experience to modern levels of achievement.&lt;ref name="Sport &amp; the Extreme"/&gt;  This proficiency has also helped boost the popularity of sports.&lt;ref name="Sport &amp; the Extreme"&gt;Andy Miah ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20050801000000*/https://www.media.paisley.ac.uk/andymiah/Miah1998ExtremeSpectacle.pdf Sport &amp; the Extreme Spectacle: Technological Dependence and Human Limits]'' (PDF) Unpublished manuscript, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Most sports played professionally also have amateur players far outnumbering the professionals.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}

===Baseball===
[[Baseball]] originated before the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865). A humble game played on sandlots in particular, scoring and record-keeping gave baseball gravity. "Today," notes John Thorn in The Baseball Encyclopedia, "baseball without records is inconceivable."

In 1871 the first professional baseball league was created.&lt;ref name="Baseball in America" /&gt; By the beginning of the 20th century, most large cities in the eastern United States had a professional baseball team. The teams were divided into two leagues, the National and American leagues. During the regular season, a team played only against other teams within its league. The most victorious team in each league was said to have won the "pennant;" the two pennant winners met after the end of the regular season in the World Series. The winner of at least four games (out of a possible seven) was the champion for that year. This arrangement still holds today, although the leagues are now subdivided and pennants are decided in post-season playoff series between the winners of each division.&lt;ref name="Baseball in America"&gt;{{cite web |title= Baseball in America: A History |publisher= The U.S. Department of State via factmonster.com |accessdate= 14 December 2014 |url= http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0875086.html |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141217101150/http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0875086.html |archivedate= 17 December 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baseball became popular in the 1920s, when [[Babe Ruth]] led the [[New York Yankees]] to several [[World Series]] titles and became a national hero on the strength of his [[home run]]s (balls that cannot be played because they have been hit out of the field). One of the most noteworthy players was the Brooklyn Dodgers' [[Jackie Robinson]], who became the first African-American player in the major leagues in 1947. Prior to Robinson, black players [[Baseball color line|had been restricted]] to the [[Negro Leagues]].&lt;ref name="Baseball in America" /&gt;

Starting in the 1950s, major league baseball expanded its geographical range. Western cities got teams, either by luring them to move from eastern cities or by forming expansion teams with players made available by established teams. Until the 1970s, because of strict contracts, the owners of baseball teams also virtually owned the players; since then, the rules have changed so that players can become [[free agent]]s, within certain limits, to sell their services to any team. The results have been bidding wars and stars who are paid millions of dollars a year. Disputes between the players' union and the owners have at times halted baseball for months at a time.&lt;ref name="Baseball in America" /&gt;

Japan has also seen a prominent professional baseball circuit develop known as [[Nippon Professional Baseball]], which was founded in 1934 and emerged as an international force after World War II. NPB is considered to be the highest caliber of baseball outside the U.S. major leagues, and the best Japanese talent can emigrate to the U.S. by way of the [[posting system]]. Other prominent countries to play the game include South Korea (where their league has [[Posting system (KBO)|its own posting system]] with Major League Baseball), Mexico, Latin America, and the Caribbean states.

===American football===

The game of American football was professionalized in the 1890s as a slow, and initially covert, process; [[William Heffelfinger]] and [[Ben "Sport" Donnelly]] were the first to secretly accept payment for playing the game in 1892.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Regional leagues in Chicago, [[Western Pennsylvania Professional Football Circuit|Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio League|Ohio]] and [[New York Pro Football League|New York]] had coalesced in the 1900s and 1910s, most of which gave way to the first truly national football league, the [[National Football League|American Professional Football Association]], in 1920.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} By 1920, pro football remained overshadowed by the college game. The first game involving an APFA team took place on September 26, 1920, at Douglas Park in Rock Island, Illinois, as the hometown Independents flattened the St. Paul Ideals 48-0. The first head-to-head battles in the league occurred one week later as Dayton topped Columbus 14-0 and Rock Island pasted Muncie 45-0.

Forward passes were rare, coaching from the sidelines was prohibited and players competed on both offense and defense. Money was so tight that Hals carried equipment, wrote press releases, sold tickets, taped ankles, played and coached for the Decatur club. As opposed to today’s standard 16-game schedule, clubs in 1920 scheduled their own opponents and could play non league and even college squads that counted toward their records. With no established guidelines, the number of games played—and the quality of opponents scheduled—by APFA teams varied, and the league did not maintain official standings.&lt;ref&gt;
"The Birth of the National Football League." History.com. A&amp;E Television Networks, 14 December 2014. Web. December 15, 2014. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-the-national-football-league |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104170528/http://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-the-national-football-league |archivedate=4 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buffalo All-Americans, Chicago Tigers, Columbus Panhandles and Detroit Heralds joined the league before the end of the season, raising the total number of teams to 14, but the inaugural season was a struggle. Games received little attention from the fans—and even less from the press. According to Robert W. Peterson’s book "Pigskin: The Early Years of Pro Football," APFA games averaged crowds of 4,241. The association bylaws called for teams to pay a $100 entry fee, but no one ever did. Muncie played only one game before dropping out before the end of the season, which concluded on December 19.

At the conclusion of the season there were no playoffs (that innovation, although New York's regional league had used it, would not arrive until 1933) and it took more than four months before the league even bothered to crown a champion. Much as college football did for decades, the APFA determined its victor by ballot. On April 30, 1921, team representatives voted the Akron Pros, who completed the season undefeated with eight wins and three ties while yielding only a total of seven points, the champion in spite of protests by the one-loss teams in Decatur and Buffalo, who each had tied Akron and had more wins. The victors received a silver loving cup donated by sporting goods company Brunswick-Balke-Collender. While players were not given diamond-encrusted rings, they did receive golden fobs in the shape of a football inscribed with the words "World Champions."

Forgotten in the collective sports memory that the league’s official record books listed the 1920 championship as undecided until the 2013. The whereabouts of the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Cup, only given out that one time, are unknown. The legacy of two APFA franchises continues on, however. The Racine Cardinals now play in Arizona, and the Decatur Staleys moved to Chicago in 1921 and changed their name to the Bears the following year. Ten APFA players along with Carr are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which opened its doors in 1963 not far from the Canton automobile dealership that gave birth to the NFL in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-the-national-football-league |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104170528/http://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-the-national-football-league |archivedate=4 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}
"The Birth of the National Football League." History.com. A&amp;E Television Networks, December 14, 2014. Web. 15 December 2014. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-the-national-football-league |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104170528/http://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-the-national-football-league |archivedate=4 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The APFA, by 1922 known as the [[National Football League]], has remained the predominant professional football league in the United States, and, effectively, the entire world. The evolution from a haphazard collection of teams in big and small cities to the much more rigid structure it is in the present was gradual; the smaller markets were squeezed out in the late 1920s and early 1930s, a [[NFL Championship Game|championship game]] was established in 1933, a [[NFL Draft|draft]] was established in 1936, and schedules were standardized in the 1930s. A competing league has historically arisen to attempt to challenge the NFL's dominance every 10 to 15 years, but none managed to maintain long-term operations independent of the NFL and only two—the [[All-America Football Conference]] of the late 1940s and the [[American Football League]] of the 1960s—were strong enough to successfully compete against the league before the NFL subsumed their operations. [[Minor league]] football, although their leagues' memberships were unstable, began to arise in the late 1930s and remained viable as a business model up into the 1970s.

A major factor in the NFL's rise to dominance was its [[National Football League on television|embrace of television]] early in the sport's history. As college football heavily restricted the rights of its teams to broadcast games (a policy eventually [[NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma|ruled to be illegal]] in 1984), the NFL instead allowed games to be televised nationwide, [[National Football League television blackout policies|except in a team's home city]]; the restriction was softened in the early 1970s, by which point the NFL had secured broadcast deals with all of the [[Big Three television networks|major television networks]], another major factor in the inability of any competing league to gain traction since then.

The related sport of [[Canadian football]] was eventually professionalized by the 1950s, which saw the evolution of the [[Canadian Football League]]. The CFL, despite losing all games in a series of contests against the NFL, was considered to be at least comparable in talent to the American leagues of the 1960s (its lone game against an AFL squad was a victory). Because Canada has a tenth of the population of the United States, the ability to make money from television was much lower, and although some of the cities of Canada were comparable to the major markets of the U.S., teams in places such as Saskatchewan and Hamilton were in markets quite small compared to even the small markets of the NFL, thus the CFL now pays noticeably less than other major professional leagues, but still more than enough to be considered fully professional.

The rise of [[indoor American football]] beginning in the late 1980s has allowed for smaller-scale professional football to be viable.

===Ice hockey===
{{main|Professional ice hockey}}

[[Ice hockey]] was first professionalized in [[Pittsburgh]] in the early 1900s (decade). As Canadians made up the vast majority of hockey players, early American professional leagues imported almost all of their talent before Canadian leagues began to form in the wake of a mining boom, depriving the U.S. leagues and teams of talent. Two distinct circuits formed: the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] in western Canada and the northwestern U.S., and the [[National Hockey Association]] of central Canada, both of which competed for the then-independent [[Stanley Cup]]. The NHA's teams reorganized as the [[National Hockey League]] in 1917, and the West Coast circuit died out by the mid-1920s.

By 1926, the NHL expanded to 10 teams in Canada, and in the northeastern and midwestern United States. However, the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1930s, combined with Canada's entry into World War II (which greatly reduced the league's player pool), led to the league’s retrenchment to six markets: Boston, New York City, Chicago and Detroit in the U.S., and Toronto and Montreal in Canada. These [[Original Six]] cities would be the only cities with NHL franchises from 1935 to 1967. During this time, the NHL was both stagnant and restrictive in its policies, giving teams territorial advantages, having teams with multiple owners in the same family (thus allowing the best players to be stacked onto certain teams), and restricting its players' salaries through [[reserve clause]]s. This stagnation allowed other leagues to arise: the [[Western Hockey League (1952–74)|Western Hockey League]] soon became the ''de facto'' major league of the western states and provinces, and the second-tier [[American Hockey League]] emerged in a number of midwestern markets the NHL had neglected, in addition to a handful of small towns.

Amid pressure from television networks that were threatening to offer the WHL a contract, the NHL [[1967 NHL expansion|doubled in size in 1967]], beginning a period of expansion that lasted through much of the 1970s. The last major challenger to the NHL's dominance was the [[World Hockey Association]], which successfully broke the NHL's reserve clause in court, drove up professional hockey salaries, and continued to pressure the older league into expansion. The WHA merged four of its remaining teams into the NHL in 1979, but had to give up most of its players, as they were still under NHL contract and had to return to their original teams. The NHL made its last pronounced realignment in the 1990s, moving most of the WHA teams out of their markets and establishing a number of new teams in the southern United States.

In Europe, the introduction of professionalism varied widely, and the highest-caliber league on the continent, the [[Soviet Championship League]] (proven to be at least equal to or better than the NHL in the 1970s), was officially composed of [[semi-professional]] [[works team]]s paid for their association with industries or government agencies (the [[HC CSKA Moscow|Red Army squad]] employed members of the armed forces, and the Soviet Union often drafted the best hockey players in the country to serve on the squad). The modern-day descendant of the Soviet league, the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], is fully professional and has a number of teams outside Russia, to the point where it has the resources to sign NHL veterans. Other European countries such as Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, Finland, and Austria also have prominent professional leagues.

===Basketball===

{{see also|List of basketball leagues}}
[[Basketball]] was invented in 1891 and the first professional leagues emerged in the 1920s. The [[Basketball Association of America]] was established in 1946 and three years later became the modern [[National Basketball Association]]. The NBA was slower to establish dominance of the sport than other sports in the United States, as it would not do so until 1976, when it absorbed four teams from the [[American Basketball Association]].

Professional basketball has the advantages of much smaller rosters than other professional sports, allowing the sport to be viable in smaller cities than other sports. Professional basketball leagues of varying caliber can be found around the world, especially in Europe and South America.

===Resistance to professionalism===
Professional athleticism is seen as a contradiction of the central ethos of [[sport]], [[competition]] performed for its own sake and pure enjoyment, rather than as a means of earning a living.&lt;ref name="Sport &amp; the Extreme"/&gt; Consequently, many organisations and commentators have resisted the growth of professional athleticism, saying that it was so incredible that it has impeded the development of sport. For example, [[rugby union]] was for many years a part-time sport engaged in by amateurs, and English [[cricket]] has allegedly suffered in quality because of a "non-professional" approach.&lt;ref name="Sport &amp; the Extreme"/&gt; An important reason why professional sports has been resisted in history was that organisations for professional sports usually did not submit to the international sports federations, and could have their own rules.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} For example, the [[National Basketball Association]] was formerly not a member of the [[FIBA]].

On the other hand, amateur rules heavily favour those countries where all elite players are de facto professionals but are able to retain their amateur status by earning allowances instead of salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coubertin.org/docs/Winter%20Games%20Schantz.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919124001/http://coubertin.org/docs/Winter%20Games%20Schantz.pdf |archivedate=19 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, all [[Eastern bloc]] countries were populated with amateur players who were actually full-time athletes hired as regular workers of a company ([[Krylya Sovetov Moscow|aircraft industry]], [[HC Spartak Moscow|food workers]], [[Traktor Chelyabinsk|tractor industry]]) or organization ([[HC Dynamo Moscow|KGB]], [[HC CSKA Moscow|Red Army]], [[VVS Moscow|Soviet Air Force]]) that sponsored what would be presented as an after-hours [[sports club|social sports society]] [[works team|team for their workers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-17.html|title=PROTESTING AMATEUR RULES, CANADA LEAVES INTERNATIONAL HOCKEY|author=IIHF|date=2008|publisher=IIHF.com|accessdate=2017-08-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010205021/http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-17.html|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports salaries==
Men involved in professional sports can earn a great deal of money at the highest levels. For instance, the highest-paid team in professional baseball is [[New York Yankees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/teams/salaries?team=tam|title=Tampa Bay Rays 2015 Player Salaries and Team Payroll - ESPN|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=16 August 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405084930/http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/teams/salaries?team=tam|archivedate=5 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tiger Woods]] is the highest-paid athlete, totaling $127,902,706, including his [[Testimonial|endorsement]] income,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peoplestar.co.uk/index.html?celebs=3 « The World's Highest-Paid Athletes »] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726025224/http://www.peoplestar.co.uk/index.html?celebs=3 |date=26 July 2012 }}, ''peoplestar.co.uk'', Retrieved on 11 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; which massively exceeds what he earns from tournament golf. Woods recently became the world's first athlete to earn a billion dollars from prize money and endorsements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/54235,sport,news,tiger-woods-becomes-sports-first-billionaire |title=Tiger Woods becomes sport’s first billionaire |last=Underwood |first=Harry |date=1 October 2009 |work=TheWeek.co.uk |accessdate=21 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213035642/http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/54235,sport,news,tiger-woods-becomes-sports-first-billionaire |archivedate=13 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have taken the salary of two thousand 1980s professional golfers each making $58,500 to match up with Tiger Woods’ current salary. [[Samuel Eto'o]] is the world's second highest-earning athlete and the highest-paid [[Association football|footballer]] in the world, raking in £35.7 million (over $54 million) a year excluding off-field earnings.&lt;ref name="Samuel Eto'o to become world's highest earning footballer"/&gt; The top ten tennis players make about $3 million a year on average. Much of the growth in income for sports and athletes has come from [[Broadcasting of sports events|broadcasting rights]]; for example, the most recent [[NFL on television|television contract for the NFL]] is valued at nearly [[United States dollar|US$]]5 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NFL renews television deals |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7353238/nfl-re-ups-tv-pacts-expand-thursday-schedule |publisher=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=14 December 2011 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215163439/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7353238/nfl-re-ups-tv-pacts-expand-thursday-schedule |archivedate=15 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the U.S., on the other hand, make much less, for example as of 2014, the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] enforced a maximum salary of US$107,000 for star players (coaches could earn double that).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diana Taurasi's decision to sit out should spark WNBA salary changes|author=Fagan, Kate|date=Feb 4, 2015|publisher=ESPN|url=http://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/12272036/diana-taurasi-decision-sit-spark-wnba-salary-changes|accessdate=November 6, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107155126/http://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/12272036/diana-taurasi-decision-sit-spark-wnba-salary-changes|archivedate=7 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely driven by the fact that the American viewing audience has far less interest in women's professional sport compared to men's; average in-person attendance and television viewership are both far higher for the NBA compared to the WNBA. According to investopedia.com, a male star like [[Kobe Bryant]] or [[LeBron James]] can individually earn a salary larger than every player in the WNBA combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reference.com/sports-active-lifestyle/highest-paid-wnba-player-bcaf4e2c1e892b3d#|title=Who is the highest paid WNBA player?|publisher=Reference.com|accessdate=November 6, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107013612/https://www.reference.com/sports-active-lifestyle/highest-paid-wnba-player-bcaf4e2c1e892b3d|archivedate=7 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the highest leagues, however, the money professional athletes can earn drops dramatically, as fan bases are generally smaller and television revenues are nonexistent. For instance, while the [[National Football League]]'s teams can afford to pay their players millions of dollars each year and still maintain a significant profit, the second-highest American football league in the United States, the [[United Football League (2009–12)|United Football League]], consistently struggled to pay its bills and has continually lost money despite allotting its players only US$20,000 a year, and television networks made the league [[brokered programming|pay for television airtime]] instead of paying the league, making the league's business model unworkable.&lt;ref name=VirginianPilot10032012&gt;[http://hamptonroads.com/2012/10/agent-three-ufl-players-havent-been-paid-yet "Agent: Three UFL players haven't been paid yet,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729163210/http://hamptonroads.com/2012/10/agent-three-ufl-players-havent-been-paid-yet |date=29 July 2013 }} from ''The Virginian-Pilot'', 10 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Joe (10 October 2012).

''NFL.com''. Retrieved 2011-01-02.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and Canada, most lower-end professional leagues run themselves as affiliated [[farm team]]s, effectively agreeing to develop younger players for eventual play in the major leagues in exchange for subsidizing those players' salaries; this is known as the [[minor league]] system and is most prevalent in [[professional baseball]] and [[professional ice hockey]]. Otherwise, the league may be required to classify itself as [[semi-professional]], in other words, able to pay their players a small sum, but not enough to cover the player's basic costs of living.

Many professional athletes [[Personal finances of professional American athletes|experience financial difficulties]] soon after retiring, due to a combination of bad investments, careless spending, and a lack of non-athletic skills. The wear and tear of a career in professional sport, can cause physical and mental side effects (such as [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]], a condition that has seen a massive rise in public awareness in the 2010s) that can harm a former professional athlete's employability. In the United States, some of these problems are mitigated by the fact that the [[college sports]] system ensures most professional athletes receive a college education with no student debt, a legacy that provides them with a career path after their sports career ends.

'''Richmond Cricket Club''' was based in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] (historically part of Surrey and now in London) and was a leading club during the 18th century. Its home venue was at [[Richmond Green cricket ground|Richmond Green]]. It ceased to exist sometime after 1805. The [[Richmond Cricket Club (London)|current Richmond club]], which plays in the [[Middlesex County Cricket League]], was founded in 1862.

==Earliest mentions==
Richmond is first recorded as an [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important team]] in July 1720. In June 1736, two of its players challenged a [[London Cricket Club|London]] duo in a [[single wicket]] contest. The two Richmond players were unnamed in the newspaper report but were nevertheless "esteemed the best two in England" and so one of them is believed to have been [[William Sawyer (cricketer)|William Sawyer]].&lt;ref&gt;Waghorn, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153250/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1731.html#1736 From Lads to Lord's – 1736]. Retrieved 14 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1740s==
In 1740, a combined Richmond and [[Moulsey Hurst|Moulsey]] team played two matches against London. The first was incomplete due to rain and the second was won by London.&lt;ref&gt;Waghorn, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1742, Richmond played London at the [[Artillery Ground]] "for a considerable sum" but the result is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley-Cooper, 1742&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[James Love (poet)|James Love]], well known in cricket circles for his ''Cricket: An Heroic Poem'' (1744), was a playing member of the Richmond club but probably the greatest ever Richmond player was his teammate, the innkeeper William Sawyer. He had by this time established himself as "one of the best six players in England" and was a regular choice for big single wicket contests such as the one in 1743 between Three of Kent and Three of All-England.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153248/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1741.html#1743 From Lads to Lord's – 1743]. Retrieved 14 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, there were two more single wicket contests between Five of Richmond and Five of London, one game on Richmond Green and the return at the [[Artillery Ground]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashley-Cooper, 1743&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1743, Richmond twice played London in [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important matches]] and were beaten each time, but London needed to have the great Kent player [[Robert Colchin]] as a given man.

Richmond played London in an important match on [[Kennington Common]] in July 1744 but the result is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Richmond evidently declined in the latter half of the 1740s as there are no further references to the club apart from one match in 1749 when a Richmond &amp; Ripley XI played London at the Artillery Ground, but again the result is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley-Cooper, 1749&lt;/ref&gt; By 1751, Richmond was playing minor matches only.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153249/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1751.html#1751 From Lads to Lord's – 1751]. Retrieved 14 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turn of century revival==
The club continued to play inter-parish matches until the end of the 18th century and saw something of a revival between 1799 and 1805 when it had a team of near important standard that played matches against clubs like [[Montpelier Cricket Club]] and [[Homerton Cricket Club]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Haygarth]], ''Scores &amp; Biographies'', Volume 1 (1744–1826), Lillywhite, 1862&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Richmond club went out of existence sometime in the 19th century, possibly during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] as there is no record of it after 1805.

'''Roots Hall''' is a [[Soccer-specific stadium|football stadium]] located in [[Southend-on-Sea]], [[Essex]], [[England]]. The stadium is the home ground of the [[EFL League One|League One]] [[football club]] [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]]. With a capacity of 12,392&lt;ref name="footballgroundguide.com"&gt;http://www.footballgroundguide.com/southend_united/&lt;/ref&gt; Roots Hall is the largest football stadium in [[Essex]], and is the current venue for the final of the [[Essex Senior Cup]]. Plans are in place for a new 22,000 seat stadium at [[Fossetts Farm]], though work has yet to begin on the new development.

== History ==

=== Pre-Roots Hall (1900s–1940s) ===
The site now occupied by Roots Hall is where Southend United had originally played their home games on their formation in 1906. Upon the outbreak of the [[First World War]] the area was designated for storage and Southend were forced out. After the war the club elected to move to a new ground at the [[Kursaal (amusement park)|Kursaal]] and Roots Hall first became a quarry for sand then a tipping site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.football-stadiums.co.uk/grounds/england/roots-hall/|title=Roots Hall|work=Football Stadiums|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relocation to Roots Hall (1950s) ===
By the early 1950s Southend had moved to [[Southend Stadium]] off Sutton Road. The club did not own the ground and the dog track which encircled the pitch made it unsuitable for use as a football stadium. In 1952 the wasteland at the old Roots Hall site was purchased to build a new stadium for the club.&lt;ref name=sufcwebsite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southendunited.co.uk/page/RootsHall/0,,10444,00.html|title=ROOTS HALL|date=8 August 2008|publisher=www.southendunited.co.uk|accessdate=5 January 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212163637/http://www.southendunited.co.uk/page/RootsHall/0,,10444,00.html|archivedate=12 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the ground could not begin immediately owing to the large quantities of rubbish which had been dumped on the site in the club's absence, which took nearly a year to clear. On 20 August 1955 Roots Hall hosted its first match, against [[Norwich City Football Club|Norwich City]].&lt;ref name=sufcwebsite/&gt; The ground was declared open by the Secretary of [[the Football Association]], [[Stanley Rous|Sir Stanley Rous]]. The ground remained the youngest in the Football League until the opening of [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]]'s [[Glanford Park]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/southampton/news/6857/southend-awaydaze/on-this-day|title=Southend Awaydaze - Southampton News|work=The Ugly Inside|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roots Hall's construction had not been completed when the ground was opened, with some stands only running for a short distance along the touchline and others waiting to be concreted over.&lt;ref name=sufcwebsite/&gt; In addition to these problems, the pitch's drainage was unsuitable and by the end of the [[1955-56 in English football|1955–56]] season it had to be completely relaid.&lt;ref name=sufcwebsite/&gt;

=== Ground development (1960s) ===

With the pitch issue dealt with, Southend could concentrate on the matter at hand: completing the ground. The west bank roof, originally set back from the pitch, was extended forwards to the touchline creating a double-barrel effect, while work also commenced on finishing the terracing. The job was finally finished in 1964, after all 72 steps of the giant south bank had been concreted.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://100groundsclub.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/my-matchday-247-roots-hall.html|title=My Matchday - 247 Roots Hall|website=100groundsclub.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The east stand was extended in both directions so it ran the full length of the touchline in 1966, and around the same time the club installed floodlighting. Finally the ground was finished, and had its finest day in 1979, when a ground record 31,033 fans packed the Hall to watch [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in action in the FA Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stadiumguide.com/roots-hall/|title=Roots Hall Stadium - Southend - The Stadium Guide|website=www.stadiumguide.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent work (1980s–present) ===

By the mid-1980s, however, the club were struggling financially. In an effort to keep the club afloat, most of the south bank was sold off in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/southend-soap-opera-may-have-sad-ending-637463.html|title=Southend soap opera may have sad ending|date=2000-10-05|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually the remainder was replaced in 1994 by a small two tiered all-seater stand, designed by then club chairman Vic Jobson. All this came after the west and east stands saw work in 1992, when the west bank was turned into an all-seated stand and the paddocks in the east had seating attached. The final stage of development at the Hall came in 1995, when the west stand roof was extended at either end to meet the south and north stands, with seating being installed in the north-west corner of the ground.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Development since has been mainly concentrated on the ground's facilities, in recent years the club opened a new ticket office and club shop, replaced the old style turnstiles with modern electronic ones and extended executive accommodation at the rear of the east stand. A new digital scoreboard was also added to the north stand roof in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New scoreboard to be installed|url=http://www.southendunited.co.uk/news/article/051112-new-scoreboard-to-be-installed-468480.aspx|publisher=www.southendunited.co.uk|accessdate=23 January 2013|date=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relocation to Fossetts Farm ===
In the 1990s Southend United started planning to leave Roots Hall for a proposed new ground at [[Fossetts Farm Stadium|Fossetts Farm]].&lt;ref name=fossettsappr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/essex/content/articles/2008/03/06/southend_stadium_feature.shtml|title=New Southend United stadium receives government backing|publisher=BBC Essex|date=6 March 2008|accessdate=5 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, the club received planning permission from both [[Southend-on-Sea|Southend]] and [[Rochford (district)|Rochford]] councils for the stadium, retail outlets, a hotel and new training facilities but this was subject to rubber-stamping from the Secretary of State. The Department for Communities and Local Government gave broad approval to the plans in March 2008&lt;ref name=fossettsappr/&gt; and [[planning permission]] was granted later the same month for the [[HOK Sport Venue Event|HOK]]-designed new stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoksport.com/news/080310_SouthendUnited.html |title=Southend United Awarded Planning For New Stadium Development |publisher=www.hoksport.com |date=10 March 2008 |accessdate=5 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120020852/http://www.hoksport.com/news/080310_SouthendUnited.html |archivedate=20 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roots Hall has been sold to [[Sainsbury's]], which has received planning permission to build a new supermarket on the site. Building work on Fossetts Farm was due to start in 2014, however due to issues with the supermarket development, as Sainsbury's had yet to complete the purchase of the former Prospects College site, which was required for access to the new store, work failed to commence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://twohundredpercent.net/southend-united-fossetts-farm-f-words/|title=Southend United: Fossetts Farm &amp; Other F Words {{!}} Twohundredpercent|website=twohundredpercent.net|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 28 April 2017 new plans were submitted for the work which no longer involved Sainsbury's. The move to the new stadium was scheduled for December 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/15252750.Fresh_Southend_United_stadium_plans_for_Fossetts_Farm_set_to_be_revealed/|title=Fresh Southend United stadium plans for Fossetts Farm set to be revealed|website=Echo|language=en|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

=== Fairfield BMW East Stand ===
The east stand is the main stand at Roots Hall, running along one side of the pitch. Originally designed as a section of seating with paddocks of [[terrace (stadium)|terracing]] below, it was converted to an all seater stand in the 1990s. The stand also contains executive boxes and, in the back, the club offices. The [[Technical area|dugouts]] are cut into the stand, covered by the main roof. The stand was originally much smaller and evidence of its extension along the touchline can be seen in the density of [[moss]] on the roof. According to the club website this stand contains 2,878 seats,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.southendunited.co.uk/club/visiting-roots-hall/|title=Visiting Roots Hall|website=www.southendunited.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; but recently a small block of seats on the far right side was removed to house training goals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Hi-Tec South Stand ===
Originally a 72-step terrace, financial troubles in the mid-1990s saw the old terrace reduced dramatically before being replaced by a significantly smaller two-tier stand. The bottom tier forms part of the family enclosure, alongside part of the west stand. According to the club website this stand contains 2,029 seats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Paul Robinson West Stand ===
The west was also formerly a terrace, though it was converted into a stand by bolting seats (purchased second hand from [[Manchester City F.C.]]) onto the existing structure, reducing the total capacity to 3,337.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visiting Roots Hall Stadium|url=http://www.southendunited.co.uk/tickets/first-visit-roots-hall/|publisher=www.southendunited.co.uk|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the terrace only ran the length of the [[touch-line]] but when the ground was improved in the 1990s the north-west corner was filled-in. This section is sometimes used for away supporters, depending on demand. The roof has a unique double-barrelled construction; originally the stand's cover was set back from the pitch, and when the club constructed cover for the front section of the old terrace they built another identical span. A small section of the west stand has been designated as the family stand, and Block W (at the north end of the stand) houses "The Blue Voice" singing section which provides game atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebluevoice.co.uk/about-tbv|title=About TBV - The Blue Voice SUFC|website=www.thebluevoice.co.uk|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ADSI North Stand ===
The north stand, also known as the north bank, is another converted terrace. The roof has a semi-circular 'barrel' shape, similar to the west stand's original roof, with a [[scoreboard]] in the centre. Part of the north stand is designated for up to 1,200 away supporters,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://footballtripper.com/roots-hall-stadium-southend-united/|title=Roots Hall Stadium Guide - Southend Utd F.C {{!}} Football Tripper|date=2014-08-09|work=Football Tripper|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; but if necessary the whole stand can be allocated to bring the allocation up to around 2,000 which has been achieved at large matches such as those against [[Manchester United F.C.]] and [[Chelsea F.C]]. During 2010–2013, whenever there were small away crowds, Blues fans were allowed into the north stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.footballgroundguide.com/southend_united/|title=Football Ground Guide: Roots Hall, Southend United FC|date=2013-03-29|access-date=2017-06-01|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329213944/http://www.footballgroundguide.com/southend_united/|archivedate=29 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rødovre Mighty Bulls''' is a [[Denmark|Danish]] professional [[ice hockey]] team based in [[Rødovre]], Denmark, playing in the [[Metal Ligaen]], the top tier of Danish ice hockey. The club was founded in 1961 and play their home games in the [[Rødovre Skøjte Arena]] which has a capacity of 3,600 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohockey.com/club/349-rdovre-mighty-bulls.html|title=Rødovre Mighty Bulls|publisher=Eurohockey.com|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohockey.com/arena/759-rdovre-skjte-arena.html|title=Rødovre Skøjte Arena|publisher=Eurohockey.com|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohockey.com/arena/759-rdovre-skjte-arena.html|title=Rødovre Skøjte Arena|publisher=Eurohockey.com|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club has won the Danish championship 6 times in 1978, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1990 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mightybulls.dk/historien-fra-stov-til-guld/|title=History|publisher=mightybulls.dk|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1977-1979, the team was coached by [[Boris Kulagin]], the former coach of the [[Soviet national ice hockey team]]. Kulagin joined the Danish team after getting fired as head coach of the Soviet national team following a disappointing 3rd-place finish at the [[1977 World Ice Hockey Championships]]. Rødovre had used contacts at the Soviet Embassy in Copenhagen, asking them to find a suitable coach for the team. Much to their surprise, they received the famous World Championship winning coach. The fact that such a high level coach was sent to coach in the then lowly Danish league was seen by many as an additional form of punishment for the poor result at the 1977 World Championships. Under Kulagin's guidance, the team won their first Danish title in 1978.

'''''The Big Game''''' (German: '''''Das große Spiel''''') is a 1942 [[Cinema of Germany|German]] [[sports film]] directed by [[Robert A. Stemmle]] and starring [[René Deltgen]], [[Gustav Knuth]] and [[Heinz Engelmann]]. It featured famous German footballers of the era. National coach [[Sepp Herberger]] arranged for many German international footballers to be recalled from fighting in the [[Second World War]], ostensibly to improve the quality of the film, but actually to try to protect them from the horrors of war.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse-Lichtenbeger p.91-92&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sequences of the film are in [[Agfacolor]]. The sets were designed by [[art directors]] [[Gerbert Hochreiter]] and [[Walter Schlick]].

'''Shenzhen F.C. II''', known as '''[[Xiangxue Pharmaceutical|Xiangxue]] Eisiti''' for sponsorship reason, was a [[China|Chinese]] football team which played in [[Hong Kong First Division League]] in 2008–09 season. It was the [[reserve team]] of [[Shenzhen F.C.]], known as Shenzhen Xiangxue Eisiti (''Shenzhen Xiangxue Shangqingyin'') for sponsorship reasons at that time.

==Home ground==
Xiangxue Eisiti wanted to host its games at the sports ground of {{ill|Shenzhen Bogang F.C.|zh|深圳壆岗足球俱乐部}} in [[Shajing Subdistrict, Shenzhen|Shajing]], [[Bao'an District]], but after inspection by the HKFA, the ground was considered unsuitable to host any league games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.hkfa.com/includes_files/board_details.php?news_id=6083 |script-title=zh:2008/09年度香港足球總會快意空調甲組聯賽安排  |access-date=2008-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912233706/http://www.hkfa.com/includes_files/board_details.php?news_id=6083 |archive-date=2008-09-12 |dead-url=yes |df=|publisher=HKFA|language=zh-hk }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Xiangxue Eisiti had to play all their home games at [[Mongkok Stadium]] or [[Siu Sai Wan Sports Ground]].

''' The Yale Club of New York City''', commonly called ''' The Yale Club''', is a [[gentlemen's club|private club]] in [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] [[Manhattan]], in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]]. Its membership is restricted almost entirely to alumni and faculty of [[Yale University]]. With a clubhouse comprising 22 stories The Yale Club has a worldwide membership of over 11,000. Upon opening its doors in 1915, the building became the largest Clubhouse in the world and continues to be the largest college clubhouse in existence today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yaleclubnyc.org/history]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clubhouse==

Four other clubs affiliated with [[Ivy League]] universities have clubhouses in the surrounding neighborhood: the [[Harvard Club of New York]], the [[Princeton Club of New York]], the [[Penn Club of New York City]], and the [[Cornell Club]].&lt;ref name="oldyaleclub"&gt;"The Old Yale Club; Make Way for the Blue and Gold," ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 9, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood also includes similar clubs not affiliated with universities, like the [[New York Yacht Club]] and the [[University Club of New York]],&lt;ref name="oldyaleclub"/&gt; as well as the flagship stores of [[Brooks Brothers]], [[J. Press]], and [[Paul Stuart]], which traditionally catered to the club set.&lt;ref&gt;"The Season; Tickling the Ivy," ''The New York Times'', September 19, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The 22-story clubhouse contains three dining spaces (the "Tap Room," the "Grill Room," and the Roof Dining Room and Terrace), three bars (in the Tap Room, Grill Room, and Main Lounge), banquet rooms for up to 500 people, 138 Guest Rooms, a library, a Fitness and Squash Center with three international squash courts, and a barber shop, among other amenities. The heart of the clubhouse is the main lounge, a large room with a high, ornate ceiling and large columns and walls lined with fireplaces and portraits of the five Yale-educated United States [[List of United States Presidents by college education|presidents]], all of whom are or were members of the Yale Club: [[William Howard Taft]], [[Gerald R. Ford]], [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Bill Clinton]], and [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Painter And the President," ''The New York Times'', November 9, 2003,&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the lounge above the main staircase hangs a posthumous portrait of [[Elihu Yale]] by [[Francis Edwin Elwell]].

==History==

===Early history===
The roots of the club reach back to 1868 and the foundation of the Old Yale Alumni Association of New York. In response to the association's desire for a permanent clubhouse, it formally established the Yale Club in 1897. One of the incorporators was [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Chauncey Depew]], whose portrait by the Swiss-born American artist [[Adolfo Müller-Ury]] painted in 1890 hangs in the building. The first president of the Yale Club was attorney [[Thomas Thacher]], founder of [[Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett]]. The first clubhouse was a rented [[brownstone]] at 17 East 26th Street. Thereafter, in 1901, the club built and opened a new, twelve-story clubhouse at 30 West 44th Street, which today is home to the Penn Club of New York.&lt;ref name="oldyaleclub"/&gt;

The current clubhouse opened in June 1915, designed by architect and Yale alumnus [[James Gamble Rogers]].&lt;ref name="Citycyclopedia"/&gt;  It was largely paid for by money raised or contributed by President George C. Ide of Brooklyn (whose portrait by [[George Burroughs Torrey]] also hangs in the building). It purposely was situated on the very corner where Yale alumnus [[Nathan Hale]] was hanged by the [[British Army]] for [[espionage]] during the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref name="halearticle"&gt;"Yale Club Had but One Hale to Lose," ''The New York Times'', January 19, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the site of Hale's execution is disputed.&lt;ref name="halearticle"/&gt;

According to the [[Ken Burns]] documentary [[Prohibition (miniseries)|''Prohibition'']], the Yale Club was able to stock up enough liquor to see the club through the repeal of Prohibition in 1933.

===21st century===
[[File:Carsonpalmerheisman.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Heisman Trophy]] which was awarded to [[University of Southern California|USC]] [[USC Trojans football|Trojans]] quarterback [[Carson Palmer]] at the Yale Club in 2002.]]

In July 1999, the Yale Club became the first of New York's [[Ivy League]] university clubs to change its dress code to [[business casual]], a move which upset some members and was received with polite scorn from other clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eli Chic or Boola Boorish?; Moral Crisis: Yale Club Goes Casual on Fridays|newspaper=The New York Times|last=Collins|first=Glenn|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/20/nyregion/eli-chic-or-boola-boorish-moral-crisis-yale-club-goes-casual-on-fridays.html|date=August 20, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the dress code remains business casual, except in the athletic facilities. In the fall of 2012, the club began to allow [[denim]] to be worn in the library, the Grill Room, and on the rooftop terrace during the summer, but nowhere else, as long as it is "neat, clean, and in good repair."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/blog/?p=15771 Carole Bass, "At Yale Club of NYC, Yale blue now includes denim — sometimes," ''Yale Alumni Magazine'' (Aug. 27, 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the [[Heisman Trophy]], traditionally presented at the [[Downtown Athletic Club]], was presented at the Yale Club in 2002 and 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/collegeother/20021215heisman1215p5.asp 68th Heisman Trophy ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/news-article.aspx?storyid=12043 Okla. QB Jason White Wins Heisman Trophy]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 winner was quarterback [[Carson Palmer]] of the [[University of Southern California|USC]] [[USC Trojans football|Trojans]], and the 2003 winner was quarterback [[Jason White (American football)|Jason White]] of the [[University of Oklahoma]] [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Sooners]].

In June 2007, former [[United States Solicitor General]] and onetime [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] nominee [[Robert Bork]] sued the club in [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|federal court]]. Bork alleged that, while trying to reach the [[dais]] to speak at an event for ''[[The New Criterion]]'' magazine, he fell because the club negligently failed to provide steps or a handrail between the floor and the dais.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Membership==
To be eligible for election to membership, a candidate must be alumni, faculty member, or full-time graduate student of Yale University. The club also offers legacy memberships for any Yale-affiliated member's children. The club sends out a monthly newsletter to all members.

[[Yale College]] did not allow women to become members until 1969.&lt;ref&gt;"High and Dry At the Yale Club?" ''The New York Times'', November 5, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Wives of members even had to enter the club through a separate entrance (today the service entrance), and were not allowed to have access to much of the clubhouse.&lt;ref name="voteforwomen"&gt;"Vote of 35-to-15 Lets Women Join 6,000-Member Yale Club," ''The New York Times'', July 31, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Once Yale opened to women, however, the club quickly followed suit on July 30, 1969,&lt;ref name="voteforwomen"/&gt; although the club did not open its bar, dining room, or athletic facilities to women until 1974&lt;ref&gt;"Women's Privileges Widened at Yale Club," ''The New York Times'', June 15, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; and did not open its swimming pool (known as "the plunge") to women until 1987.&lt;ref&gt;"Yale Club Lets Women Take 'the Plunge,'" ''The New York Times'', October 7, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Now, though, women constitute a large percentage of the club's membership.

Three other, smaller clubs also are in residence at the Yale Club: the [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] Club, the [[University of Virginia|Virginia]] Club, and the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] Club.  Members of these other clubs have the same access to the clubhouse and its facilities as members of the Yale Club itself.

According to a book published for the club's 1997 centennial, members at that time included [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[Gerald Ford]], [[John Kerry]] and [[George Pataki]]. Among others were architect [[Cesar Pelli]] and author [[David McCullough]]. Today, the Yale Club has over 11,000 members worldwide.

They also have a nice-looking [[necktie]]."&lt;ref&gt;"My Turn," by John O'Hara, ''Newsday'', September 4, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; O'Hara lamented his lack of a Yale degree so often that his friend [[Ernest Hemingway]] joked that a collection should be taken up to send O'Hara to Yale.
