The '''2009 Brazil and Paraguay blackout''' was a [[power outage]] that occurred throughout much of [[Brazil]] and for a short time the entirety of [[Paraguay]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1938011,00.html?xid=rss-topstories], [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/10/brazil-blackout-largest-c_n_353217.html], [https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20091111/wl_afp/brazilenergyblackout], [https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091111/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_brazil_blackouts] and [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33844757/ns/world_news-americas]&lt;/ref&gt; on Tuesday, November 10, 2009, at approximately 22:15 [[Time in Brazil|BST]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN11339425 |title=ANALYSIS-Brazil blackout a glitch, but shows investment need |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2009-11-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091114104019/https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN11339425| archivedate= 14 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blackout affected an estimated 60 million people in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ET |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33844757/ns/world_news-americas/ |title=Lights flicker on after blackout in Brazil - Americas- msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2009-11-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091112173303/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33844757/ns/world_news-americas/| archivedate= 12 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The blackout ==
Thousands of passengers were stranded as [[rapid transit|metro]] trains came to a halt and buses failed to cope with the volume of passengers. There were widespread reports of road accidents as street lighting and traffic lights failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/eaef7304-cea9-11de-8812-00144feabdc0.html |title=/ Americas - Inquiry ordered after Brazilian blackout |publisher=Ft.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blackout began about 22:15 on Tuesday and lasted until about 02:45 on Wednesday in São Paulo, although power was restored gradually in some places from before midnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-11/12/content_12437443.htm |title=Brazilian President says massive blackout isolated incident_English_Xinhua|publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2007-05-22 |accessdate=2009-11-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091115155737/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-11/12/content_12437443.htm| archivedate= 15 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/11/11/brazil.blackout/index.html |title=Power restored in Brazil after blackouts - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com|date= 2009-11-11|accessdate=2009-11-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091112024820/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/11/11/brazil.blackout/index.html| archivedate= 12 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Causes ===
Heavy rains and strong winds caused three [[transformer]]s on a key high-voltage transmission line to [[short circuit]], cutting the line and automatically causing the complete loss of 14 GW of power and the  shutdown of the [[Itaipu Dam]] for the first time in its 25-year history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bradley Brooks |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gvYTfvBdDutkp67sdM0KKETo0JpQD9BTKV701 |title=Bad weather blamed in blackout for 60M in Brazil |agency=AP |date= |accessdate=2009-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,574246,00.html |title=Official: Brazil Blackout Caused by Bad Weather |publisher=Fox News |date= 2009-11-11|accessdate=2009-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power cut, which Brazilian officials said affected 18 of the country's 26 [[States of Brazil|states]], brought chaos to cities including [[São Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Campo Grande]] and [[Vitória, Brazil|Vitória]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/11/10/brazil.blackout/index.html |title=Dam failure triggers huge blackout in Brazil – CNN.com|publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=2009-11-11|accessdate=2009-11-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112024851/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/11/10/brazil.blackout/index.html |archivedate=12 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media such as Slashdot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://it.slashdot.org/story/09/11/09/0012226/Massive-Power-Outages-In-Brazil-Caused-By-Hackers |title=Massive Power Outages In Brazil Caused By Hackers – Slashdot |publisher=It.slashdot.org |date=|accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[60 Minutes]]'' reported&lt;ref name=wired /&gt; that the outage was the work of hackers.  However, in December, 2010, [[WikiLeaks]] released a US diplomatic cable which suggested otherwise. The cable also reported that it

&lt;blockquote&gt;
represented a loss of 28,000 megawatts – or 45 percent of total Brazilian consumption at that instant – of electricity and left an estimated 87 million residents without power. Scrutiny has been intense and speculation rife over the cause of the incident, in large part due to the recent announcement of Rio as the host of the 2016 summer Olympics.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and indicated that the longest outage was 6 hours, in São Paulo, and details interim reports on what failures caused the outage, and responses under consideration.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/brazil-blackout/|title=WikiLeaked Cable Says 2009 Brazilian Blackout Wasn’t Hackers, Either|work=[[Wired News]]|accessdate=16 December 2010|first=Marcelo|last=Soares|date=2010-12-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209051931/http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/brazil-blackout/ |archivedate=9 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://213.251.145.96/cable/2009/12/09BRASILIA1383.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-12-16 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20101206143746/http://213.251.145.96/cable/2009/12/09BRASILIA1383.html |archive-date=2010-12-06 |dead-url=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paraguay ===

The Itaipu Dam is shared with Paraguay. In the immediate aftermath of its failure, interconnecting lines to Paraguay's other large powerplant, the [[Yacyreta Dam]] (in the border with Argentina), also failed. All of the country's territory was affected by the blackout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.com.py/abc/nota/45053-Gigantesco-apag%C3%B3n-en-el-Brasil-deja-a-oscuras-a-todo-Paraguay/ |title=ABC Digital - Gigantesco apagón en el Brasil deja a oscuras a todo Paraguay |publisher=Abc.com.py |date=2009-07-03 |accessdate=2009-11-12|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Redacción VOA 11.11.09 |url=http://www1.voanews.com/spanish/news/latin-america/Paraguay-senala-Brasil-por-apagon-69785472.html |title=Paraguay señala a Brasil por apagón &amp;#124; América Latina &amp;#124; Spanish |publisher=.voanews.com |date=2009-08-20 |accessdate=2009-11-12|language=Spanish| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091114064952/http://www1.voanews.com/spanish/news/latin-america/Paraguay-senala-Brasil-por-apagon-69785472.html| archivedate= 14 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2011 Khuzestan protests''', known among protesters as the '''Ahvaz Day of Rage''', relates to violent protests, which erupted on 15 April 2011 in [[Khuzestan Province]], to mark an anniversary of the [[2005 Ahvaz unrest]], and as a response to the regional [[Arab Spring]]. The protests lasted for 4 days and resulted in 12 to 15 protesters killed and many wounded and arrested. 1 security officer was killed as well, and another wounded.&lt;ref name=aa1506&gt;[http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/06/15/220811.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Crackdown on Arab political opposition in the area continued since with arrests and executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2012/jun/13/five-ahwazi-arab-risk-execution-iran-amnesty | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Iran Arab prisoners at risk of execution, Amnesty warns | date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|2005 Ahvaz unrest}}
{{further|Khaz'al ibn Jabir al-kaabi}}
The [[Iranian Embassy Siege]] of 1980 in London was initiated by an Arab separatist group as an aftermath response to the regional crackdown in Khuzestan, after the [[1979 Khuzestan uprising|1979 uprising]]. Initially it emerged the terrorists wanted autonomy for Khuzestan; later they demanded the release of 91 of their comrades held in Iranian jails.&lt;ref&gt;See:

The latest developments of this conflict erupted in the recent decade, when a large scale [[2005 Ahvaz unrest|violent unrest]] took place in April 2005 and consequently a series of [[Ahvaz bombings|bombings]] was carried out in Ahvaz and other cities in Iran, blamed upon Sunni Arab separatist groups of Ahvaz.

==History==
It is believed that initial calls for the protest were prompted by "a leaked secret government strategy to try to change the demographic chart of Ahwaz and make ethnic Arab residents a minority", when they are currently the majority [[ethnic group]] in the [[Khuzestan province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=One dead in Ahwaz clash |author=Mustapha Ajbaili |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/04/16/145638.html |newspaper=[[Al Arabiya]] |date=16 April 2011 |accessdate=2 March 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HtqeTvpW?url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/04/16/145638.html |archivedate=6 July 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests by [[Iranian Arabs]] erupted on 15 April 2011, the sixth anniversary of the [[2005 Ahvaz unrest]] in the city of [[Ahvaz]], capital of the Iranian Khuzestan province. The protesters were "demanding more rights and humanitarian benefits". Al Arabiya reported that when the protests began, the city was blockaded by Iranian security forces, who "broke up demonstrations by force" and that 15 people from Ahwaz have been killed and dozens have been wounded.&lt;ref name=ahwaz&gt;{{cite news |title=Fifteen dead in Iran’s Ahwaz |author=Ammar Benaziz and Abeer Tayel |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/04/18/145845.html |newspaper=[[Al Arabiya]] |date=18 April 2011 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The security forces were reported to have been using various weapons, such as [[AK-47|Kalashnikovs]] and [[tear gas canister]]s. During the night on 15 April, it was reported that "nighttime raids" were conducted against persons believed to have been involved in the protests.&lt;ref name="EUReview"&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran: Calls To Investigate Reported Killings Of Demonstrators |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/29042011-iran-calls-to-investigate-reported-killings-of-demonstrators/ |newspaper=[[Eurasia Review]] |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanon-based journalist Roula Hajjar wrote on the [[Los Angeles Times]]'s blog that the protests on 15 April had also occurred in the cities Abadan, Khorramshahr, Mahshahr and Shadegan. She noted that the events had "largely escaped international attention primarily due to the efforts of Iranian officials."  She also stated that the state news agencies in Iran had reported the killing of at least three people, "including one officer", by "armed insurgents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=IRAN: Outside the spotlight, Arab uprising smolders in country's southwest |author=Roula Hajjar |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2011/04/iran-ahvaz-protests-violence-human-rights-arab-separatism.html |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=30 April 2011 |accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of the protest was attributed to the use of [[social networking]] sites [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name="EUReview"/&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Arrests in late 2011===
Iranian security forces arrested more than 65 Arab residents during security sweeps in Iran’s Arab-majority Khuzestan province since late 2011 according to local activists, Human Rights Watch said.&lt;ref name=unhcr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,IRN,,4f34de412,0.html |title=Iran: Arrest Sweeps Target Arab Minority |date=7 February 2012 |publisher=[[UNHCR]] |accessdate=2 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120183330/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CIRN%2C%2C4f34de412%2C0.html |archivedate=20 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports by local activists indicated security sweeps in the towns of Hamidiyeh, Shush and Ahvaz.&lt;ref name=unhcr/&gt; At least some of the arrests were carried in response to anti-government slogans and graffiti spray-painted on public property expressing sympathy for the Arab Spring and calling for a boycott of Iran’s parliamentary elections of March 2012.&lt;ref name=unhcr/&gt;

===Death verdicts to 5 Arab Iranians===
Five Arab Iranian men from Ahvaz were arrested in 2011 during the demonstrations and were charged of killing a security and intelligence officer and wounding another. They were sentenced to death on 15 March 2012.&lt;ref name=aa1506/&gt;

==Responses==
* [[Human Rights Watch]] released a statement, saying that the Iranian government should allow international media into the area. Joe Stork, the Middle East director of HRW, stated, "Iran has made it impossible to confirm the scale of the deadly violence against protesters in Khuzestan province, making transparent and independent investigations into alleged killings and arrests there absolutely essential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran: Investigate Reported Killings of Demonstrators |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/29/iran-investigate-reported-killings-demonstrators |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Amnesty International]] demanded in a news report that the Iranian government "investigate clashes between security forces and protesters" and "called for all those detained to be protected from torture or other ill-treatment and to be granted access to their families, lawyers and adequate medical treatment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran Arab minority protest deaths must be investigated |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/iran-arab-minority-protest-deaths-must-be-investigated-2011-04-19 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |date=19 April 2011 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] and [[The Guardian]], Nobel Laureate [[Shirin Ebadi]] sent "a letter to UN human rights chief Navi Pillay in which she describes a deadly crackdown by Iranian security forces last week on a peaceful protest in Khuzestan's capital, Ahvaz." Human rights activists told RFE/RL they have received reports that "there were more than 150 arrests, including a number of intellectuals, artists, and women's rights activists." and that "the rest of the activists were told to not speak to any media organization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran's Nobel Laureate Ebadi Warns Of Unrest Among Ethnic Arabs In Iran |author=Esfandiari, Golnaz |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/iran_nobel_ebadi_warns_unrest_ethnic_arabs_in_iran/9498400.html |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |date=19 April 2011 |accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dehghan&gt;{{cite news |title=Iranian Sunni protesters killed in clashes with security forces |author=Saeed Kamali Dehghan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/18/iranian-sunni-protesters-killed |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=18 April 2011 |accessdate=3 June 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On June 2012, [[European Union]] condemned the Iranian authorities, following the pending execution of five members of Iran’s Ahvaz Arab minority, over “current disrespect of minority rights” and urged the authorities in Tehran to allow minorities “to exercise all rights granted by the Iranian Constitution and international law.”&lt;ref name=aa1506/&gt;

==Casualties==
According to Al-Arabiya, 15 Arab protesters were killed in Khuzestan between  15–18 April 2011.&lt;ref name=ahwaz/&gt; Nobel Laureate [[Shirin Ebadi]] stated that "at least 12 people were killed" in the protests, "20 injured", and "dozens were arrested".&lt;ref name=dehghan/&gt;

According to Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, security operations in Khuzestan province since protests there in April 2011, have resulted in the largest number of deaths and injuries since the crackdown that followed the disputed 2009 presidential election.&lt;ref name=unhcr/&gt;

The '''2011–12 Strait of Hormuz dispute''' is an ongoing dispute between a coalition of countries and Iran. The dispute arose on 27 December 2011, when an Iranian Vice President [[Mohammad-Reza Rahimi]] threatened to close the [[Strait of Hormuz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Iran threatens to block Strait of Hormuz oil route |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16344102 |publisher=BBC News |date=28 December 2011 |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, a number of naval drills and missile tests were carried out by Iran. A coalition of countries responded by sending a flotilla of warships to deter any Iranian attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz and warned Iran publicly and through letters not to close the Strait.

The dispute was interjected by a [[European Union]] sanction banning oil exports from Iran to Europe on 23 January 2012 in an attempt to deter Iran from continuing with their [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear program]]. Oil exports contribute to about 80% of Iranian public revenue,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Iran threatens new war games in the oil lanes of the Gulf |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/8996819/Iran-threatens-new-war-games-in-the-oil-lanes-of-the-Gulf.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=6 January 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with roughly 20% being exported to Europe. Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea, which both account for 26% of Iran's oil exports have expressed a willingness to reduce oil exports from Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Q&amp;A: Iran sanctions |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15983302 |publisher=BBC News |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Strait is situated off the coast of Iran and is a recognised international trade route. The strait is narrowest at {{convert|21|nmi|km}} and is recognised as a naval [[choke point]].&lt;ref name=eia-20120104&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=4430 |title=The Strait of Hormuz is the world's most important oil transit chokepoint |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |date=4 January 2012 |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil is a key commodity with approximately 20% of seaborne oil in the world transported via the Strait of Hormuz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=What is the Strait of Hormuz? Can Iran shut off access to oil? |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/01/what-is-the-strait-of-hormuz-and-why-are-people-worried-about-it.html |work=Los Angeles Times |date=24 January 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Strait of Hormuz has been the scene of a stand-off between Iran and the United States before. On 18 April 1988, the U.S. Navy waged a one-day battle against Iranian forces in and around the strait. The battle, dubbed [[Operation Praying Mantis]] by the U.S. side, was launched in retaliation for the mining of the {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|FFG-58|6}} on 14 April by Iran. U.S. forces sank one [[Islamic Republic of Iran Navy]] frigate, one gunboat, and as many as six armed speedboats in the engagement and seriously damaged a second frigate.

On 26 January 2012, the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' wrote:
{{quote|Iran's strategy of asymmetric warfare recognizes that, since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has little chance of winning any face-to-face military contest with powerful enemies like the United States.

Instead, Iran aims to "exploit enemy vulnerabilities through the used of 'swarming' tactics by well-armed small boats and fast-attack craft, to mount surprise attacks at unexpected times and places" which will "ultimately destroy technologically superior enemy forces," writes Iranian military expert Fariborz Haghshenass in a 2008 study based on published doctrines of the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] (IRGC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Teheran can accomplish its objectives simply by clogging the strait, adds the ''Monitor''. The ''Monitor'' also makes reference to [[Millennium Challenge 2002]], a major war game exercise conducted by the United States armed forces in mid-2002, in which Red forces, commanded by retired Marine Corps Lt. General [[Paul K. Van Riper]], used old methods to evade Blue's sophisticated electronic surveillance network, and a significant portion of Blue's navy was "sunk".

==Dispute==
On 27 December 2011, Iranian [[Vice President of Iran|Vice President]] [[Mohammad-Reza Rahimi]] threatened to cut off oil supply from the Strait of Hormuz should economic sanctions limit, or cut off, Iranian oil exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/12/27/markets/oil_iran/index.htm?hpt=hp_t2 |title=Oil jumps over 2% as Iran threatens supplies|publisher=CNN|date=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on that same date, the U.S. aircraft carrier {{USS|John C. Stennis|CVN-74}} concluded a four-day port visit to [[Jebel Ali|Jebel Ali, United Arab Emirates]], and returned to the [[North Arabian Sea]] in support of coalition ground operations in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] via the Strait of Hormuz.&lt;ref name=CVN74USCarrier2011&gt;{{cite web | title= History – 2011 | url= http://www.uscarriers.net/cvn74history.htm | work= USS ''John C.

To coincide with this threat, Iran carried out Velayat 90, a 10-day military exercise in international waters near the Strait of Hormuz.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;{{Cite news |title=US aircraft carrier filmed by Iran in Strait of Hormuz standoff |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/8984448/US-aircraft-carrier-filmed-by-Iran-in-Strait-of-Hormuz-standoff.html |work=The Telegraph |date=30 December 2011 |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States countered this exercise with an increased naval presence in and around the Persian Gulf, with the aircraft carrier ''John C. Stennis'' pictured by Iranian reconnaissance in the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt; A [[United States Fifth Fleet|U.S. Fifth Fleet]] spokeswoman said in response that the Fleet was "always ready to counter malevolent actions", whilst Admiral Habibollah Sayari of the Iranian navy claimed that cutting off oil shipments would be "easy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US warns Iran over threat to block oil route |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16348633 |publisher=BBC News |date=28 December 2011 |accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security analysts in the West were largely unconcerned by Iran's capabilities to disrupt trade in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dan|first=Shingleton|title=Just How Big a Threat to the Shipping Industry Would an Iranian Blockade of Hormuz Be?|url=http://www.handyshippingguide.com/shipping-news/just-how-big-a-threat-to-the-shipping-industry-would-an-iranian-blockade-of-hormuz-be_3344|publisher=Handy Shipping Guide|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 January 2012, following the end of Velayat 90, the [[Iranian Army]] chief of staff, General [[Ataollah Salehi]], was quoted by the state news agency [[IRNA]] as warning the United States to not deploy the ''Stennis'' back to the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name=Hafezi/&gt; Iranian Army chief Ataollah Salehi said the United States had moved an aircraft carrier out of the Gulf because of Iran's naval exercises, and Iran would take action if the ship returned.  "Iran will not repeat its warning...the enemy's carrier has been moved to the [[Gulf of Oman]] because of our drill.  I recommend and emphasize to the American carrier not to return to the Persian Gulf", he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran threatens U.S. Navy as sanctions hit economy |first=Parisa |last=Hafezi |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/03/us-iran-usa-idUSTRE80208P20120103 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=3 January 2012 |accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Joby Warrick and Steven Mufson | title= Iran threatens U.S. ships, alarms oil markets | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-in-new-provocation-threatens-us-ships/2012/01/03/gIQAzEiGZP_story.html | work= National Security | date= 3 January 2012 | accessdate= 4 January 2012 }} and {{cite web | author= Nasser Karimi | title= Iran warns US carrier: Don't come back to Gulf | url= http://ap.stripes.com/dynamic/stories/M/ML_IRAN_NAVY_DRILL?SITE=DCSAS&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-01-03-06-28-51 | agency= [[Associated Press]] | work= [[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]] | date= 3 January 2012 | accessdate= 4 January 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 January 2012, [[Fars News Agency]] reported that a bill was being prepared for the [[Iranian Parliament]] to bar foreign naval vessels from entering the Persian Gulf unless they receive permission from the Iranian navy, with Iranian lawmaker Nader Qazipour noting: "If the military vessels and warships of any country want to pass via the Strait of Hormuz without coordination and permission of Iran’s navy forces, they should be stopped by the Iranian armed forces."&lt;ref name=Erdbrink&gt;{{cite web | author= Thomas Erdbrink | title= Iran prepares bill to bar foreign warships from Persian Gulf | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iran-prepares-bill-to-bar-foreign-warships-from-persian-gulf/2012/01/04/gIQAhlWYaP_story.html | work= Middle East | date= 4 January 2012 | accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Iranian Defense Minister [[Ahmad Vahidi]] reiterated that "transnational forces" have no place in the Persian Gulf region.&lt;ref name=Erdbrink/&gt;

The U.S. Navy spokesman Commander Bill Speaks quickly responded that deployment of U.S. military assets would continue as has been the custom stating: "The U.S. Navy operates under international maritime conventions to maintain a constant state of high vigilance in order to ensure the continued, safe flow of maritime traffic in waterways critical to global commerce."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran nuclear crisis: Sanctions 'beginning to bite' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16396345 |publisher=BBC News |date=3 January 2012 |accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January 2012, the United Kingdom announced that it would be sending the [[Type 45 destroyer]] {{HMS|Daring|D32|6}} to the Persian Gulf. ''Daring'', which is the lead ship of her class is claimed to be one of the "most advanced warships" in the world, and will undertake its first mission in the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Royal Navy sends its mightiest ship to take on the Iranian show of force in the Gulf |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/8997956/Royal-Navy-sends-its-mightiest-ship-to-take-on-the-Iranian-show-of-force-in-the-Gulf.html |last=Harding |first=Thomas |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=6 January 2012 |accessdate=8 January 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Government however have said that this move has been long-planned, as ''Daring'' will replace another [[Armilla patrol]] frigate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=HMS Daring to head for the Gulf |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5i7M_kVZAIV-1CSF6rnljPJ6eHnyg?docId=N0842061325887459210A |agency=[[Press Association]] |date=7 January 2012 |accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this maiden deployment, ''Daring'' operated with [[Carrier Strike Group One]] in the Persian Gulf and Carrier Strike Group Nine in the North Arabian Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daring enjoys 'truly amazing' experience working with American carriers |url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/News-and-Events/Latest-News/2012/March/20/120320-Daring-Carriers |work=News &amp; Events |publisher=[[Royal Navy]] |date=20 March 2012 |accessdate=23 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322235837/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/News-and-Events/Latest-News/2012/March/20/120320-Daring-Carriers |archivedate=22 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Christopher S.

On 9 January 2012, Iranian Defense Minister [[Ahmad Vahidi]] denied that Iran had ever claimed that it would close the Strait of Hormuz, saying that "the Islamic Republic of Iran is the most important provider of security in the strait...if one threatens the security of the Persian Gulf, then all are threatened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran and the Strait of Hormuz |url=http://subyraman.com/iran-and-the-strait-of-hormuz/ |work=Tabeer |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729233754/http://subyraman.com/iran-and-the-strait-of-hormuz/ |archivedate=29 July 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vahidi did reiterate that "transnational forces" have no place in the Persian Gulf region.&lt;ref name=Erdbrink/&gt; Also, on 9 January 2012, [[Carrier Strike Group One]], led by the carrier {{USS|Carl Vinson|CVN-70|2}}, joined [[Carrier Strike Group Three]], led by the ''Stennis'', in the North Arabian Sea.

The Iranian Foreign Ministry confirmed on 16 January 2012 that it has received a letter from the United States concerning the Strait of Hormuz, "via three different channels." Authorities were considering whether to reply, although the contents of the letter were not divulged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/46010868 |title=News Headlines |publisher=CNBC |date=16 January 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US had previously announced its intention to warn Iran that closing the Strait of Hormuz is a "red line" that would provoke an American response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/13/world/middleeast/us-warns-top-iran-leader-not-to-shut-strait-of-hormuz.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Elisabeth | last1=Bumiller | first2=Eric | last2=Schmitt | first3=Thom | last3=Shanker | title=U.S. Warns Top Iran Leader Not to Shut Strait of Hormuz | date=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gen. [[Martin E. Dempsey]], the chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], said this past weekend that the United States would "take action and reopen the strait," which could be accomplished only by military means, including minesweepers, warship escorts and potentially airstrikes. Defense Secretary [[Leon E. Panetta]] told troops in Texas on Thursday that the United States would not tolerate Iran's closing of the strait. Nevertheless, Iran continued to discuss the impact of shutting the Strait on world oil markets, saying that any disruption of supply would cause a shock to markets that "no country" could manage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-16/oil-climbs-from-four-week-low-as-iran-warns-of-hormuz-supply-disruption.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Grant | last=Smith | title=Oil Climbs From Four-Week Low as Iran Warns of Hormuz Supply Disruption | date=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January tensions rose further after the [[European Union]] imposed sanctions on Iranian oil. A senior member of Iran's parliament said that the Islamic Republic would close the entry point to the Gulf if new sanctions block its oil exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran threatens to close Strait of Hormuz over EU oil sanctions |first=David |last=Blair |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/9032948/Iran-threatens-to-close-Strait-of-Hormuz-over-EU-oil-sanctions.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "If any disruption happens regarding the sale of Iranian oil, the Strait of Hormuz will definitely be closed," [[Mohammad Kossari]], deputy head of parliament's foreign affairs and national security committee, told the semi-official [[Fars News Agency]].

The International Mine Countermeasures Exercise 2012, (IMCMEX 12) or IMCMEX 2012, was held 16–27 September 2012 in multiple locations in the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT) area of operations (''pictured'').  This multi-national mine warfare exercise was the largest ever held in the region, and it involved navies from more than 30 nations.  The purpose of IMCMEX 12 was protecting three critical [[Border checkpoint|maritime chokepoints]] at the [[Strait of Hormuz]], the [[Suez Canal]], and the [[Bab-el-Mandeb|Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb]] (''see map'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= IMCMEX 12, Largest Mine Countermeasure Exercise in Middle East Begins | url= http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=69610 | work= NNS120916-02 | publisher= [[NAVCENT|U.S. Naval Forces Central Command Public Affairs]] | date= 26 June 2012 | accessdate=29 January 2013|quote=Registration required.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= An Unprecedented Minesweeping Exercise in the Strait of Hormuz | url= http://www.stratfor.com/sample/analysis/unprecedented-minesweeping-exercise-strait-hormuz | publisher= [[STRATFOR]] | date= 20 September 2012 | accessdate=29 January 2013|quote=Registration required.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
[[File:Strait of Hormuz.jpg|thumb|right|Blue arrows illustrate the Traffic Separation Scheme for the Strait of Hormuz.]]
Despite an initial 2% rise in oil prices, oil markets ultimately did not react significantly to the Iranian threat, with oil analyst Thorbjoern Bak Jensen of Global Risk Management concluding that "they cannot stop the flow for a longer period due to the amount of U.S. hardware in the area".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oil falls on dollar's rise, Wall Street pullback |first=Robert |last=Gibbons |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/28/us-markets-oil-idUSTRE7AD06820111228 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=28 December 2011 |accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While earlier statements from Iran had little effect on global oil markets, coupled with the new sanctions, these terse comments from Iran are driving crude futures higher, up over 4%.&lt;ref name="Anti-Mine Presence"/&gt; Pressure on prices reflect a combination of uncertainty driven further by China's recent response – reducing oil January 2012 purchases from Iran by 50% compared to those made in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UPDATE 1-China extends Iran oil import cut as sanctions mount |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/05/iran-oil-china-idUSL3E8C5EFP20120105 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=5 January 2012 |accessdate=31 January 2013 | quote=China, which buys around 10 percent of Iran's crude exports, cut its January purchases by about 285,000 barrels per day, just over half of the total average daily amount it imported in 2011.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warships==
A number of countries dispatched warships to the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea in an effort to ward off any Iranian closure of the Hormuz Strait.

__NOTOC__
Year '''456 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Lactuca and Caeliomontanus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 298 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 456 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

'''Abraham Lincoln''' (February 12, 1809&amp;nbsp;– April 15, 1865) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 16th [[President of the United States]] from 1861 until [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|his assassination]] in April 1865. Lincoln led the nation through the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William A. Pencak|title=Encyclopedia of the Veteran in America|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yyvmcMsNnB4C&amp;pg=PA222|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=222|isbn=978-0-313-08759-2|access-date=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Finkelman|author1-first=Paul|author2-last=Gottlieb|author2-first=Stephen E.|title=Toward a Usable Past: Liberty Under State Constitutions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJuXT1sVhFcC&amp;pg=PA388|year=2009|publisher=U of Georgia Press|page=388|}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, he preserved the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|abolished slavery]], strengthened the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], and modernized [[Economy of the United States|the economy]].

Born in  Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the [[American frontier|western frontier]] in a poor family. Self-educated, he became a lawyer in Illinois.  As a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, he served eight years in the legislature and two in Congress, then resumed his law practice. Angered by the success of Democrats in opening the western prairie lands to slavery,  he reentered politics in 1854. He was a leader in building in the West the new [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] from Whigs and anti-slavery Democrats.  He gained national attention in 1858 [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|debating]] a top national Democratic leader [[Stephen A. Douglas]]. Although he lost that race he became the western candidate for the 1860 presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state.  He swept the [[Northern United States|North]] and was [[United States presidential election, 1860|elected president in 1860]].  Southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the North was rejecting the Constitutional rights of Southern states to promote slavery. They began the process of seceding from the union and forming a new country. But nationalism was a powerful force in the North, which refused to tolerate secession.  When the new [[Confederate States of America]] fired on [[Fort Sumter]], one of the few U.S. forts left in the South, Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].  As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted [[Radical Republican]]s, who demanded harsher treatment of the South; [[War Democrats]], who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. 

Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other, by carefully distributed political patronage and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory.&lt;ref&gt;Randall (1947), pp. 65–87.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Gettysburg Address]] became an iconic endorsement of [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of generals, including his most successful general, [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. He made major decisions on Union war strategy, including a [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] that shut down the South's trade. As the war progressed, his complex moves toward ending slavery included the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of 1863; Lincoln used the U.S. Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraged the [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and pushed through Congress the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which permanently outlawed slavery.

An astute politician, knowledgeable concerning factional feuds in each state, Lincoln reached out to the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]]. Anticipating the war's conclusion, Lincoln pushed a moderate view of [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]], seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness.  A few days after victory was complete he was assassinated, and ever since Lincoln has been remembered  as the martyr hero of the reunited nation. Lincoln has been consistently [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States#Scholar survey results|ranked]] both by scholars&lt;ref name="Ranking Our Presidents"&gt;[http://history-world.org/pres.pdf "Ranking Our Presidents"] for dealing with the American Civil War, and slavery. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131101450/http://history-world.org/pres.pdf |date=January 31, 2012}}.

===Early life===
{{Main|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln}}
Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, as the second child of [[Thomas Lincoln|Thomas]] and [[Nancy Lincoln|Nancy Hanks Lincoln]], in a one-room log cabin on the [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park|Sinking Spring Farm]] near [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a descendant of [[Samuel Lincoln]], an Englishman who migrated from [[Hingham, Norfolk]], to its namesake of [[Hingham, Massachusetts]], in 1638. Samuel's grandson and great-grandson began the family's western migration, which passed through [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis A.

Lincoln's mother, Nancy, is widely assumed to have been the daughter of Lucy Hanks, although no record of Nancy Hanks' birth has ever been found.&lt;ref name=Bartelt79&gt;{{cite book|author=William E.

Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks were married on June 12, 1806, in Washington County, and moved to [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]], following their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; They became the parents of three children: Sarah, born on February 10, 1807; Abraham, on February 12, 1809; and another son, Thomas, who died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thomas Lincoln bought or leased several farms in Kentucky, including the Sinking Spring farm, where Abraham was born; however, a land title dispute soon forced the Lincolns to move.&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Warren12"&gt;Warren, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1811, the family moved {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} north, to [[Knob Creek Farm]], where Thomas acquired title to {{convert|230|acre|ha}} of land. In 1815 a claimant in another land dispute sought to eject the family from the farm.&lt;ref name="Warren12" /&gt; 

Of the {{convert|816.5|acre|ha}} that Thomas held in Kentucky, he lost all but {{convert|200|acre|ha}} of his land in court disputes over property titles.&lt;ref name="sandberg-20" /&gt; Frustrated over the lack of security provided by the Kentucky title survey system in the courts, Thomas sold the remaining land he held in Kentucky in 1814, and began planning a move to [[Indiana]], where the land survey process was more reliable and the ability for an individual to retain land titles was more secure.&lt;ref name="Warren13"&gt;Warren, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816, the family moved north across the [[Ohio River]] to [[Indiana]], a free, non-slaveholding territory, where they settled in an "unbroken forest"&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; in Hurricane Township, [[Perry County, Indiana#History|Perry County]]. (Their land in southern Indiana became part of [[Spencer County, Indiana]], when the county was established in 1818.)&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p. 16 and 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 3, 5, and 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The farm is preserved as part of the [[Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial]]. In 1860, Lincoln noted that the family's move to Indiana was "partly on account of slavery"; but mainly due to land title difficulties in Kentucky.&lt;ref name="sandberg-20"&gt;Sandburg (1926), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the family's years in Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas Lincoln worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter.&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 34 and 156.&lt;/ref&gt; He owned farms, several town lots and livestock, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners. Thomas and Nancy Lincoln were also members of a [[Separate Baptists]] church, which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Within a year of the family's arrival in Indiana, Thomas claimed title to {{convert|160|acre|ha}} of Indiana land. Despite some financial challenges he eventually obtained clear title to {{convert|80|acre|ha}} of land in what became known as the [[Little Pigeon Creek Community]] in Spencer County.&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 24 and 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the family's move to Illinois in 1830, Thomas had acquired an additional twenty acres of land adjacent to his property.&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 25 and 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several significant family events took place during Lincoln's youth in Indiana. On October 5, 1818, Nancy Lincoln died of [[milk sickness]], leaving 11-year-old [[Sarah Lincoln Grigsby|Sarah]] in charge of a household that included her father, 9-year-old Abraham, and Dennis Hanks, Nancy's 19-year-old orphaned cousin.&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 22–23, and 77.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On December 2, 1819, Lincoln's father married [[Sarah Bush Lincoln|Sarah "Sally" Bush Johnston]], a widow from Elizabethtown, Kentucky, with three children of her own.&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 23 and 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham became very close to his stepmother, whom he referred to as "Mother".&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who knew Lincoln as a teenager later recalled him being very distraught over his sister Sarah's death on January 20, 1828, while giving birth to a [[stillborn]] son.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 20, 30–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a youth, Lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with frontier life. Some of his neighbors and family members thought for a time that he was lazy for all his "reading, scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing Poetry, etc.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Lee Miller |title= Lincoln's Virtues: An Ethical Biography |publisher= Random House/Vintage Books |series= |volume= |edition= Vintage Books |year= 2002 |location= New York |page= 31 |url= |isbn= 978-0-375-40158-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 25, 31, and 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and must have done it to avoid manual labor. His stepmother also acknowledged he did not enjoy "physical labor", but loved to read.&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lincoln was largely self-educated. His formal schooling from several itinerant teachers was intermittent, the aggregate of which may have amounted to less than a year; however, he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning.&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 10 and 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=James H.

As he grew into his teens, Lincoln took responsibility for the chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household. He also complied with the customary obligation of a son giving his father all earnings from work done outside the home until the age of 21.&lt;ref name="donald-1996-p30-33"&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 30–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham became adept at using an axe. Tall for his age, Lincoln was also strong and athletic.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p. 134–35.&lt;/ref&gt; He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as "the Clary's Grove boys".&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early March 1830, partly out of fear of a milk sickness outbreak along the Ohio River, several members of the extended Lincoln family moved west to Illinois, a non-slaveholding state, and settled in [[Macon County, Illinois|Macon County]], {{convert|10|mi|km}} west of [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 41 and 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians disagree on who initiated the move; Thomas Lincoln had no obvious reason to leave Indiana, and one possibility is that other members of the family, including Dennis Hanks, might not have attained the stability and steady income that Thomas Lincoln had.&lt;ref&gt;Bartelt, p. 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the family relocated to Illinois, Abraham became increasingly distant from his father,&lt;ref name="Bartelt71"&gt;Bartelt, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; in part because of his father's lack of education, but occasionally lent him money.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 28 and 152.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1831, as Thomas and other members of the family prepared to move to a [[Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site|new homestead]] in [[Coles County, Illinois]], Abraham was old enough to make his own decisions and struck out on his own.&lt;ref name="Oates15-17"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stephen B.

According to some sources, Lincoln's first romantic interest was [[Ann Rutledge]], whom he met when he first moved to New Salem; these sources indicate that by 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Gannett |first=Lewis |date=Winter 2005 |title="Overwhelming Evidence" of a Lincoln-Ann Rutledge Romance?: Reexamining Rutledge Family Reminiscences |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0026.104/--overwhelming-evidence-of-a-lincoln-ann-rutledge-romance?rgn=main;view=fulltext |magazine=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association |location=Springfield, IL |publisher=The Abraham Lincoln Association |pages=28–41 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403014805/https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0026.104/--overwhelming-evidence-of-a-lincoln-ann-rutledge-romance?rgn=main;view=fulltext |archivedate=April 3, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died at the age of 22 on August 25, 1835, most likely of [[typhoid fever]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 55–58.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister.&lt;ref name="Donald 1996 pp. 67"&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 67–69; Thomas (2008), pp. 56–57, 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem. Mary did return in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts about their relationship. On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship. She never replied and the courtship ended.&lt;ref name="Donald 1996 pp. 67"/&gt;

In 1840, Lincoln became engaged to [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]], who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; They met in [[Springfield, Illinois]] in December 1839&lt;ref name="Sandburg4648"&gt;Sandburg (1926), pp. 46–48.&lt;/ref&gt; and were engaged the following December.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; A wedding set for January 1, 1841, was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincoln's initiative.&lt;ref name="Sandburg4648"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; They later met again at a party and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's married sister.&lt;ref&gt;Sandburg (1926), pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; While preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again, Lincoln, when asked where he was going, replied, "To hell, I suppose."&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1844, the couple bought [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site|a house]] in Springfield near Lincoln's law office. Mary Todd Lincoln kept house, often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an affectionate, though often absent, husband and father of four children. [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] was born in 1843 and [[Edward Baker Lincoln]] (Eddie) in 1846. Edward died on February 1, 1850, in Springfield, probably of tuberculosis. [[William Wallace Lincoln|"Willie" Lincoln]] was born on December 21, 1850, and died of a fever on February 20, 1862. The Lincolns' fourth son, [[Tad Lincoln|Thomas "Tad" Lincoln]], was born on April 4, 1853, and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16, 1871.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 179–181, 476.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children. The Lincolns' last descendant, great-grandson [[Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith]], died in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jason Emerson|title=Giant in the Shadows: The Life of Robert T. Lincoln|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tPqgC3RS-7sC&amp;pg=PA420|year=2012|publisher=SIU Press|page=420|isbn=978-0-8093-3055-3|access-date=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln "was remarkably fond of children",&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents. Abraham Lincoln suffered from "[[history of depression|melancholy]]", a condition which now is referred to as [[major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref name="Atlanticoct2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200510/lincolns-clinical-depression |title=Lincoln's Great Depression |first=Joshua Wolf |last=Shenk |date=October 2005 |work=The Atlantic |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62a4fProj?url=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/10/lincoln-apos-s-great-depression/4247/ |archivedate=October 20, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy |access-date=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and Robert Lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Steers, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;
 		 	
Lincoln's father-in-law and others of the Todd family were either slave owners or slave traders. Lincoln was close to the Todds, and he and his family occasionally visited the Todd estate in Lexington.&lt;ref&gt;Foner (1995), pp. 440–447.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his term as president of the United States, Mary was known to cook for Lincoln often. Since she was raised by a wealthy family, her cooking abilities were simple, but satisfied Lincoln's tastes, which included, particularly, imported oysters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Food Timeline—Presidents food favorites |url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/presidents.html#lincoln |publisher=foodtimeline.org |access-date=February 12, 2016 |first=Lynne |last=Olver |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204202442/http://www.foodtimeline.org/presidents.html |archive-date=February 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lincoln protecting Potawatomi.jpg|thumb|upright|Lincoln depicted protecting a Native American from his own men in a scene often related about Lincoln's service during the [[Black Hawk War]].]]

In 1832, at age 23, Lincoln and a partner ([[Denton Offutt]]) bought a small general store on credit in [[Lincoln's New Salem|New Salem]], Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth J. Winkle|title=The Young Eagle: The Rise of Abraham Lincoln|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JcEVAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77|year=2001|publisher=Taylor |pages=72–79|isbn=978-1-4617-3436-9|access-date=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the economy was booming in the region, the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share. That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the [[Illinois General Assembly]]. He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural [[raconteur]] in New Salem, though he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money, which may be why he lost. He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], [https://books.google.com/?id=fuTY3mxs9awC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=%22New%20Salem%20debating%20club%22 pp. 40–42].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Lincoln (1832) [[s:Life and Works of Abraham Lincoln/Volume 3/The Improvement of Sangamon River|"The Improvement of Sangamon River"]] in Marion Mills Miller (ed.) ''Life and Works of Abraham Lincoln'', Volume 3 – via Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the election, Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the [[Black Hawk War]].&lt;ref&gt;Winkle, pp. 86–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his return, Lincoln continued his campaign for the August 6 election for the Illinois General Assembly. At {{convert|6|ft|4|in|cm|0}},&lt;ref&gt;Sandburg (2002), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; he was tall and "strong enough to intimidate any rival". At his first speech, when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked, Lincoln grabbed the assailant by his "neck and the seat of his trousers" and threw him.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.&lt;ref&gt;Winkle, pp. 114–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor, all the while reading voraciously. He then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' and other law books. Of his learning method, Lincoln stated: "I studied with nobody".&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt; His second campaign in 1834 was successful. He won election to the state legislature; though he ran as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]], many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Admission to the bar in the United States|Admitted]] to the Illinois bar in 1836,&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; he moved to Springfield, Illinois, and began to practice law under [[John T. Stuart]], Mary Todd's cousin.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 71, 79, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments. He partnered with [[Stephen T. Logan]] from 1841 until 1844. Then Lincoln began [[Lincoln-Herndon Law Offices State Historic Site|his practice]] with [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], whom Lincoln thought "a studious young man".&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1948), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful on his second run for office, Lincoln served four successive terms in the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] as a Whig representative from Sangamon County.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the construction of the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]], which he remained involved with later as a Canal Commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abrahamlincolnsclassroom.org/abraham-lincoln-in-depth/abraham-lincoln-and-internal-improvements/#imc|title=Abraham Lincoln and Internal Improvements|first=Jesse William|last=Weik|work=Abraham Lincoln's Classroom|access-date=February 12, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212045823/http://abrahamlincolnsclassroom.org/abraham-lincoln-in-depth/abraham-lincoln-and-internal-improvements/#imc|archivedate=February 12, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1835–36 legislative session, he voted to expand suffrage to white males, whether landowners or not.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for his "free soil" stance of opposing both slavery and [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]. He first articulated this in 1837, saying, "[The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils."&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; His stance closely followed [[Henry Clay]] in supporting the [[American Colonization Society]] program of making the abolition of slavery practical by its advocation and helping the freed slaves to settle in [[Liberia]] in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Foner (2010), pp. 17–19, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early 1830s, Lincoln was a steadfast Whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be "an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay".&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The party, including Lincoln, favored economic modernization in banking, protective tariffs to fund [[internal improvements]] including railroads, and espoused urbanization as well.&lt;ref&gt;Boritt (1994), pp. 137–153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln ran for the Whig nomination for Illinois's 7th district of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1843, but was defeated by [[John J. Hardin]]. However, Lincoln won support for the principle of rotation, whereby Hardin would retire after only one term to allow for the nomination of another candidate. Lincoln hoped that this arrangement would lead to his nomination in 1846.&lt;ref name="white-123_124"&gt;White, pp. 123–124.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln was indeed elected to the House of Representatives in 1846, where he served one two-year term. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman [[Joshua R. Giddings]], wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the [[Washington, District of Columbia|District of Columbia]] with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 54; Foner (2010), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke out against the [[Mexican–American War]], which he attributed to [[James K. Polk|President Polk]]'s desire for "military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood".&lt;ref&gt;Heidler (2006), pp. 181–183.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln also supported the [[Wilmot Proviso]], which, if it had been adopted, would have banned slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Holzer, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Lincoln, Spot Resolutions in the United States House of Representatives, December 22, 1847, National Archives Building, RG 233, Entry 362: Thirtieth Congress, 1847–1849, Records of Legislative Proceedings, Bills and Resolutions Originating in the House, 1847–1849&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his [[Spot Resolutions]]. The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the U.S. Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had "invaded ''our territory'' and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our ''own soil''".&lt;ref&gt;Oates, pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Basler1pp199—202"&gt;Basler (1946), pp. 199–202.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil.&lt;ref name="Basler1pp199—202"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerleman, (2017) "Representative Lincoln at Work," 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it, the national papers ignored it, and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him "spotty Lincoln".&lt;ref name="McGovern, p. 33"&gt;McGovern, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basler (1946), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MuellerSchamel"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/lincoln-resolutions/ |title=Lincoln's Spot Resolutions |publisher=National Archives |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62a5gtE9P?url=http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/lincoln-resolutions/ |archivedate=October 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy |access-date=March 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on the presidential war-making powers.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, Lincoln, who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House, supported General [[Zachary Taylor]] for the Whig nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 1848|1848 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 124–126.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the [[General Land Office]], but that lucrative patronage job went to an Illinois rival, [[Justin Butterfield]], considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer, but in Lincoln's view, an "old fossil".&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the [[Oregon Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=Isaac Newton |date=1885 |title=The Life of Abraham Lincoln |volume=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zgDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA81 |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=Janses, McClurg, &amp; Company |page=81 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403025741/https://books.google.com/books?id=3zgDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA81 |archivedate=April 3, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pp. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield, handling "every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer".&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks at a time, he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 105–106, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a [[Hurd v. Rock Island Bridge Company|landmark case]] involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2004/summer/bridge.html Bridging the Mississippi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923204642/http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2004/summer/bridge.html |date=September 23, 2008}}.

In 1851, he represented the [[Alton Railroad|Alton &amp; Sangamon Railroad]] in a dispute with one of its shareholders, James A. Barret, who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route.&lt;ref name="Donald p. 155"&gt;Donald (1996), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dirck (2007), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter extant at the time of Barret's pledge; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer, superior, and less expensive route, and the corporation retained the right to demand Barret's payment. The decision by the [[Supreme Court of Illinois|Illinois Supreme Court]] has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation.&lt;ref name="Donald p. 155"/&gt; Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases, in 51 as sole counsel, of which 31 were decided in his favor.&lt;ref&gt;Handy, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1853 to 1860, another of Lincoln's largest clients was the [[Illinois Central Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 155–156, 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's reputation with clients gave rise to his nickname "Honest Abe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Philosophical Library |title= The Wisdom of Abraham Lincoln |publisher= Open Road Media |year= 2010 |page= 1828 |isbn= 978-1-4532-0281-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended [[William "Duff" Armstrong]], who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker.&lt;ref name="Donald150151"&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 150–151.&lt;/ref&gt; The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by [[judicial notice]] in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'' showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Based on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.&lt;ref name="Donald150151"/&gt;

Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom; but in an 1859 case, where he defended a cousin, Peachy Harrison, who was accused of stabbing another to death, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.&lt;ref name="Donald150151"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (1935), p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Republican politics 1854–60==

===Emergence as Republican leader===
{{Further|Slave and free states|Abraham Lincoln and slavery}}
[[File:Abraham Lincoln by Byers, 1858 - crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Lincoln in 1858, the year of [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|his debates]] with [[Stephen A. Douglas|Stephen Douglas]] over slavery]]

The debate over the status of slavery in the territories exacerbated sectional tensions between the slave-holding South and the North, and the [[Compromise of 1850]] failed to defuse the issue.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1850s, Lincoln supported efforts for sectional mediation, and his 1852 eulogy for Henry Clay focused on the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to "both extremes" on the slavery issue.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 182–185.&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1850s progressed, the debate over slavery in the [[Nebraska Territory]] and [[Kansas Territory]] became particularly acrimonious, and Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] of Illinois proposed [[Popular sovereignty in the United States#Emergence of the term "popular sovereignty" and its pejorative connotation|popular sovereignty]] as a compromise measure; the proposal would take the issue of slavery out of the hands of Congress by allowing the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery themselves. The proposal alarmed many Northerners, who hoped to stop the spread of slavery into the territories. Despite this Northern opposition, Douglas's [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] narrowly passed Congress in May 1854.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 188–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

For months after its passage, Lincoln did not publicly comment on the Kansas–Nebraska Act, but he came to strongly oppose it.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 16, 1854, in his "[[Abraham Lincoln's Peoria speech|Peoria Speech]]", Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), pp. 148–152.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a very powerful voice,&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; he said the Kansas Act had a "''declared'' indifference, but as I must think, a covert ''real'' zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Basler (1953), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's attacks on the Kansas–Nebraska Act marked his return to political life.&lt;ref name=white203204&gt;White, pp. 203–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nationally, the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. Reflecting the demise of his party, Lincoln would write in 1855, "I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist [...] I do no more than oppose the ''extension'' of slavery."&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 215–216.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the antislavery portion of the Whig Party, and combining [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]], [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty]], and antislavery [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] members, the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery.&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln resisted early attempts to recruit him to the new party, fearing that it would serve as a platform for extreme abolitionists.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 203–204.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln also still hoped to rejuvenate the ailing Whig Party, though he bemoaned his party's growing closeness with the nativist [[Know Nothing]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 191–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1854 elections, Lincoln was elected to the Illinois legislature but declined to take his seat.&lt;ref name=white203204/&gt; In the aftermath of the elections, which showed the power and popularity of the movement opposed to the Kansas–Nebraska Act, Lincoln instead sought election to the United States Senate.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 204–205.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; After leading in the first six rounds of voting, but unable to obtain a majority, Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for [[Lyman Trumbull]]. Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery Democrats, had vowed not to support any Whig. Lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull's antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate, [[Joel Aldrich Matteson]].&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 205–208.&lt;/ref&gt;

In part due to the ongoing [[Bleeding Kansas|violent political confrontations in the Kansas]], opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act remained strong in Illinois and throughout the North. As the [[United States elections, 1856|1856 elections]] approached, Lincoln abandoned the defunct Whig Party in favor of the Republicans. He attended the May 1856 [[Bloomington Convention]], which formally established the [[Illinois Republican Party]]. The convention platform asserted that Congress had the right to regulate slavery in the territories and called for the immediate admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the [[Lincoln's Lost Speech|final speech]] of the convention, in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 216–221.&lt;/ref&gt; At the June [[1856 Republican National Convention]], Lincoln received significant support on the vice presidential ballot, though the party nominated a ticket of [[John C. Frémont]] and [[William Dayton]]. Lincoln strongly supported the Republican ticket, campaigning for the party throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated former Ambassador [[James Buchanan]], who had been out of the country since 1853 and thus had avoided the debate over slavery in the territories, while the Know Nothings nominated former Whig President [[Millard Fillmore]].&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 224–228.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1856 elections, Buchanan defeated both his challengers, but Frémont won several Northern states and Republican [[William Henry Bissell]] won election as Governor of Illinois. Though Lincoln did not himself win office, his vigorous campaigning had made him the leading Republican in Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 229–230.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DredScott.jpg|alt=Painting|thumb|upright|A portrait of [[Dred Scott]]. Lincoln denounced the Supreme Court decision in ''Dred Scott v. Sandford'' as part of a conspiracy to extend slavery.]]

[[Eric Foner]] (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the [[republicanism in the United States|republicanism principles]] of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Foner (2010), pp. 84–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1857, the Supreme Court issued its decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]''. The opinion by Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] held that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution. While many Democrats hoped that ''Dred Scott'' would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the North.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 236–238.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln denounced the decision, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the [[Slave Power]].&lt;ref&gt;Zarefsky, pp. 69–110.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln argued, "The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity', but they 'did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'."&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, pp. 299–300.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lincoln–Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech===
{{Further|Lincoln–Douglas debates|Cooper Union speech}}

Douglas was up for re-election in 1858, and Lincoln hoped to defeat the powerful Illinois Democrat. With the former Democrat Trumbull now serving as a Republican Senator, many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and willingness to support Trumbull in 1854 had earned him favor in the party.&lt;ref name="White, pp. 247–248"&gt;White, pp. 247–248.&lt;/ref&gt; Some eastern Republicans favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the [[Lecompton Constitution]], which would have admitted Kansas as a [[slave state]].&lt;ref&gt;Oates, pp. 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt; But many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference. For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the party's Senate nomination with little opposition.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 247–250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accepting the nomination, Lincoln delivered his [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|House Divided Speech]], drawing on Mark 3:25, "A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other."&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the North.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S. senator.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; On being informed of Lincoln's nomination, Douglas stated, "[Lincoln] is the strong man of the party&amp;nbsp;... and if I beat him, my victory will be hardly won."&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 257–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate campaign featured the seven [[Lincoln–Douglas debates]] of 1858, the most famous political debates in American history.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (1993), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that "[[The Slave Power]]" was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that [[all men are created equal]], while Douglas emphasized his [[Freeport Doctrine]], that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 214–224.&lt;/ref&gt; The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the ''Dred Scott'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (2003), pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the ''Illinois Staats-Anzeiger'', a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 242, 412.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate in 1860, with [[William H. Seward]], [[Salmon P. Chase]], [[Edward Bates]], and [[Simon Cameron]] looming as rivals for the nomination. While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast, and was unsure as to whether he should seek the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 291–293.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the 1860 presidential nomination if offered, and in the following months several local papers endorsed Lincoln for president.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 307–308.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 1860, New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a [[Cooper Union speech|speech at Cooper Union]] to a group of powerful Republicans. Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery, and rejected any "groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong".&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his inelegant appearance—many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly&lt;ref&gt;Holzer, pp. 108–111.&lt;/ref&gt;—Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination. Journalist [[Noah Brooks]] reported, "No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience."&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (2003), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holzer, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[David Herbert Donald|Donald]] described the speech as a "superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival's (Seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's (Chase) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery".&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions, Lincoln said, "The taste ''is'' in my mouth a little."&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], [[Norman B. Judd|Norman Judd]], [[Leonard Swett]], and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; Exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father (clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax), Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of "The Rail Candidate".&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860 Lincoln described himself: "I am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter |first=Abraham |last=Lincoln |recipient=Jesse W.

On May 18, at the [[1860 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in Chicago, Lincoln became the Republican candidate on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, [[Hannibal Hamlin]] of Maine, was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff.&lt;ref&gt;Luthin, pp. 609–629.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the third ballot Pennsylvania put him over the top. Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, pp. 50–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others, while following Lincoln's strong dictate to "Make no contracts that bind me".&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 247–250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party, as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government with the ''Dred Scott'' decision and the presidency of James Buchanan. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession.&lt;ref&gt;Boritt (1994), pp. 10, 13, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats. Delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the [[1860 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention]], disagreeing with Douglas' position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected incumbent Vice President [[John C. Breckinridge]] as their candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; A group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] and nominated [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of Tennessee. Lincoln and Douglas would compete for votes in the North,
while Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South.&lt;ref name="White, pp. 247–248"/&gt;

Lincoln had a highly effective campaign team who carefully projected his image as an ideal candidate. As Michael Martinez says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lincoln and his political advisers manipulated his image and background....Sometimes he appeared as a straight-shooting, plain-talking, common-sense-wielding man of the people. His image as the "Rail Splitter" dates from this era. His supporters also portrayed him as "Honest Abe," the country fellow who was simply dressed and not especially polished or formal in his manner but who was as honest and trustworthy as his legs were long. Even Lincoln's tall, gangly frame was used to good advantage during the campaign as many drawings and posters show the candidates sprinting past his vertically challenged rivals. At other times, Lincoln appeared as a sophisticated, thoughtful, articulate, "presidential" candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the [[Wide Awakes]], which it used to generate popular support for Lincoln throughout the country to spearhead large voter registration drives, knowing that new voters and young voters tend to embrace new and young parties.&lt;ref name=Audacious&gt;{{cite book|title=Lincoln for President: An Unlikely Candidate, An Audacious Strategy, and the Victory No One Saw Coming|last=Chadwick|first=Bruce|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2PQqZzyw4uAC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;q=Wide%20Awake%20Parade|pages=147–149|publisher=Sourcebooks|location=Naperville, Illinois|date=2009|accessdate=April 1, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402091121/https://books.google.com/books?id=2PQqZzyw4uAC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;q=Wide%20Awake%20Parade|archivedate=April 2, 2017|df=mdy-all|isbn=9781402247569}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Lincoln's ideas of abolishing [[slavery]] grew, so did his supporters. People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln because of his ideas of anti-slavery and took action to rally supporters for Lincoln.&lt;ref name="murrin"&gt;Murrin, John. ''Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People''. Belmont: Clark Baxter, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns, Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches. Instead, he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of "free labor", whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 254–256.&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a ''Chicago Tribune'' writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life, and sold 100,000 to 200,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1860 election and secession===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1860|Baltimore Plot}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege1860.svg|thumb|alt=Map of the U.S. showing Lincoln winning the North-east and West, Breckinridge winning the South, Douglas winning Missouri, and Bell winning Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky.|In 1860, northern and western [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral]] votes (shown in red) put Lincoln into the White House.]]

On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States, beating Douglas, Breckinridge, and Bell. He was the first president from the Republican Party. His victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the North and West; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states.&lt;ref&gt;Mansch, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, Douglas 1,376,957 votes, Breckinridge 849,781 votes, and Bell 588,789 votes. Turnout was 82.2&amp;nbsp;percent, with Lincoln winning the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon. Douglas won Missouri, and split New Jersey with Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell won Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, and Breckinridge won the rest of the South.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote, his victory in the [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]] was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were [[Electoral fusion|fusion tickets]] in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union'' vol 4. p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abraham Lincoln O-55, 1861-crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The first photographic portrait of the new president]]

As Lincoln's election became evident, secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar, p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed.&lt;ref name="Donald, p. 267"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the [[Confederate States of America]].&lt;ref name="Donald, p. 267"&gt;Donald (1996), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pp. 520, 569–570.&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederacy selected [[Jefferson Davis]] as its provisional President on February 9, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were attempts at compromise. The [[Crittenden Compromise]] would have extended the [[Missouri Compromise]] line of 1820, dividing the territories into slave and free, contrary to the Republican Party's free-soil platform.&lt;ref name=White360-361&gt;White, pp. 360–361.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln rejected the idea, saying, "I will suffer death before I consent&amp;nbsp;... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right."&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln, however, did tacitly support the proposed [[Corwin Amendment]] to the Constitution, which passed Congress before Lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states. That proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that Congress would not interfere with slavery without Southern consent.&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vile_pp280&gt;Vile (2003), ''Encyclopedia of Constitutional Amendments: Proposed Amendments, and Amending Issues 1789–2002'' pp.&amp;nbsp;280–281&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks before the war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution.&lt;ref name=Lupton_2006&gt;Lupton (2006), [http://www.lib.niu.edu/2006/ih060934.html Abraham Lincoln and the Corwin Amendment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824072958/http://www.lib.niu.edu/2006/ih060934.html |date=August 24, 2016}}.

En route to his inauguration by train, Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 273–277.&lt;/ref&gt; The president-elect then [[Baltimore Plot|evaded possible assassins]] in Baltimore, who were uncovered by Lincoln's head of security, [[Allan Pinkerton]]. On February 23, 1861, he arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military guard.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 277–279.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln directed [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|his inaugural address]] to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no intention, or inclination, to abolish slavery in the Southern states:
{{quote|Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican Administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that "I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so."|[[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|First inaugural address]], 4 March 1861&lt;ref&gt;Sandburg (2002), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: "We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies&amp;nbsp;... The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the [[Peace Conference of 1861]] signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 268, 279.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln said as the war was ending:&lt;ref&gt;March 4, 1865, [[Lincoln's second inaugural address]].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.}}

===The Civil War===
{{Main|American Civil War|Battle of Fort Sumter}}
[[File:Major Robert Anderson.jpg|alt=portrait|thumb|upright|[[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Major Anderson]], Ft. Sumter commander]]

The commander of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Major Robert Anderson]], sent a request for provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], forcing them to surrender, beginning the war. Historian [[Allan Nevins]] argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union'' (1959) vol 5 p 29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Tecumseh Sherman]] talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was "sadly disappointed" at his failure to realize that "the country was sleeping on a volcano" and that the South was preparing for war.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[David Herbert Donald]] concludes that, "His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that."&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and "preserve the Union", which, in his view, still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. This call forced the states to choose sides. Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital, despite the exposed position of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] so close to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky tried to be neutral.&lt;ref name="Oates, p. 226"&gt;Oates, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederate attack on Fort Sumter rallied Americans north of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] to the defense of the American nation. Historian Allan Nevins says:&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, ''The War for the Union: The Improvised War 1861–1862'' (1959) pp.&amp;nbsp;74–75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell McClintock (2008).

{{quote|The thunderclap of Sumter produced a startling crystallization of Northern sentiment&amp;nbsp;... Anger swept the land. From every side came news of mass meetings, speeches, resolutions, tenders of business support, the muster of companies and regiments, the determined action of governors and legislatures.}}

States sent Union regiments south in response to Lincoln's call to save the capital and confront the rebellion. On April 19, mobs in Baltimore, which controlled the rail links, [[Baltimore riot of 1861|attacked Union troops]] who were changing trains, and local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital. The Army responded by arresting [[Maryland in the American Civil War#Imposition of martial law|local Maryland]] officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of ''[[Habeas corpus in the United States#Suspension during the Civil War|habeas corpus]]'' in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Heidler (2000), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Merryman]], a Maryland official involved in hindering the U.S. troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice and Marylander, [[Roger B. Taney]], author of the controversial pro-slavery ''Dred Scott'' opinion, to issue a writ of ''habeas corpus'', and in June Taney, acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the Supreme Court, issued the writ, because in his opinion only Congress could suspend the writ. Lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the [[Ex parte Merryman]] ruling.&lt;ref&gt;William C. Harris, ''Lincoln and the Border States: Preserving the Union'' (University Press of Kansas, 2011) pp.&amp;nbsp;59–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Mark E. Neely Jr.|last=Neely |first=Mark E. |title=The Fate of Liberty: Abraham Lincoln and Civil Liberties |year=1992|pages=3–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenbacks currency===
{{Main|Greenback (1860s money)}}

Before the Civil War, the only money issued by the United States was [[gold]] and [[silver]] coins, and only such coins ("specie") were [[legal tender]]; that is, payment in that form had to be accepted. Paper currency in the form of [[banknote]]s was issued by privately owned banks.

[[Greenback (1860s money)|Greenbacks]] were paper currency (printed in [[green]] on the [[obverse and reverse|back]]) issued by the [[Union (American Civil War)|United States]] during the [[American Civil War]], they were in two forms:

[[Demand Note]]s, issued In July 1861, Congress authorized $50,000,000 in Demand Notes. They bore no interest, but could be redeemed for specie "on demand". They were not legal tender (before March 1862), but like Treasury Notes could be used to pay customs duties. Unlike private and state banknotes, Demand Notes were printed on both sides. The [[Obverse and reverse|reverse side]] was printed in green ink, and so the Demand Notes were dubbed "greenbacks". Initially they were discounted relative to gold, but being fully redeemable in gold were soon at par. In December 1861, the government had to suspend redemption, and they declined. Chase authorized paying interest on Demand Notes, which sustained their value. Importers therefore continued to use Demand Notes in place of gold. In March 1862, Demand Notes were made legal tender. As Demand Notes were used to pay duties, they were taken out of circulation. By mid-1863, about 95% of them were gone.

The other form of greenbacks where the [[United States Note]]s issued in 1862–1865. They were [[legal tender]] by law, but were not backed by [[gold]] or [[silver]], only the credibility of the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brands|Brands, 2011]], p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Could ''not'' be used to pay customs duties or interest on the public debt.

===Union military strategy===
After the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]], Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and forming an overall [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] military strategy to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as [[commander-in-chief]], using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending ''habeas corpus'', arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 303–304; Carwardine (2003), pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seward|William Seward]], [[Gideon Welles]], Lincoln, and others]]

The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 315, 331–333, 338–339, 417.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861|Confiscation Act]] that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 314; Carwardine (2003), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 1861, General [[John C. Frémont]], the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, issued, without consulting his superiors in Washington, a proclamation of [[martial law]] in Missouri. He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be [[court-martial]]ed and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the [[Department of the West]] compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln overruled Frémont's proclamation. Lincoln believed that Fremont's emancipation was political, neither militarily necessary nor legal.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 314–317.&lt;/ref&gt; After Lincoln acted, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (2003), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

In foreign policy, Lincoln's main goal was to stop military aid from countries abroad to the Confederacy.{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=213–214}} Lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward.{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=213–214}} At times Seward was too bellicose, so for balance Lincoln maintained a close working relationship with Senator [[Charles Sumner]], the chairman of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trent Affair]] of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain. The U.S. Navy had illegally intercepted a British mail ship, the ''Trent'', on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. Biographer [[James G. Randall]] has dissected Lincoln's successful techniques:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Garfield Randall|title=Lincoln the President: Springfield to Gettysburg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vi8aAQAAIAAJ|year=1946|page=50|access-date=May 16, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122025358/https://books.google.com/books?id=Vi8aAQAAIAAJ|archivedate=November 22, 2016|df=mdy-all|isbn=9780306807541}} quoted in Kevin Peraino, ''Lincoln in the World: The Making of a Statesman and the Dawn of American Power'' (2013) pp 160–61.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|his restraint, his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence, his early softening of State Department's attitude toward Britain, his deference toward Seward and Sumner, his withholding of his own paper prepared for the occasion, his readiness to arbitrate, his golden silence in addressing Congress, his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted, and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for America's true position at the same time that full satisfaction was given to a friendly country.}}

Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the [[United States War Department|War Department]] headquarters. He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their past success (as well as their state and party). In January 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced [[Simon Cameron]] with [[Edwin Stanton]] as [[United States Secretary of War|War Secretary]]. Stanton centralized the War Department's activities, auditing and cancelling contracts, saving the federal government $17,000,000.{{sfn|Oates|1974|p=115}} Stanton was a staunchly Unionist pro-business conservative Democrat who moved toward the Radical Republican faction. Nevertheless, he worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official. "Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together," say Thomas and Hyman.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin P. Thomas and Harold M. Hyman, ''Stanton, the Life and Times of Lincoln's Secretary of War'' (1962) pp. 71, 87, 229–30, 385 (quote)&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of war strategy, Lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 295–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 391–392.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff General Henry Halleck, a disciple of the European strategist [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Jomini]]; he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, pp. 7, 66, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln saw the importance of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 432–436.&lt;/ref&gt;

===General McClellan===
After the Union rout at [[First Battle of Bull Run|Bull Run]], the first major battle of the Civil War, and the retirement of the aged [[Winfield Scott]] in late 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General [[George B. McClellan]] general-in-chief of all the Union armies.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 318–319.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|p=213}} McClellan, a young West Point graduate, railroad executive, and Pennsylvania Democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his [[Peninsula Campaign]], longer than Lincoln wanted. The campaign's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the [[Army of the Potomac]] by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops in defense of the capital; McClellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops, blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 349–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lincoln and McClellan 1862-10-03.jpg|alt=Photograph of Lincoln and McClellan sitting at a table in a field tent|thumb|Lincoln and [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]] after the [[Battle of Antietam]] in 1862]]

Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief in March 1862, after McClellan's "Harrison's Landing Letter", in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 360–361.&lt;/ref&gt; The office remained empty until July, when [[Henry Halleck]] was selected for it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/biographies/henry-w-halleck Henry W. Halleck]&lt;/ref&gt; McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], a Republican, as head of the new [[Army of Virginia]]. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack.&lt;ref name="Nevins 1960, pp. 2:159–162"&gt;Nevins (1960), pp. 2:159–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan, now commanding the Army of the Potomac, Pope was soundly defeated at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time.&lt;ref name="Nevins 1960, pp. 2:159–162"/&gt; The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']], formerly the USS ''Merrimack'', damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']]. Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 339–340.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, pp. 478–479.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after McClellan's return to command, General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s forces crossed the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland, leading to the [[Battle of Antietam]] in September 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, pp. 478–480.&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt;

McClellan then resisted the President's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army, while his counterpart General [[Don Carlos Buell]] likewise refused orders to move the [[Army of the Ohio]] against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with [[William Rosecrans]]; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 389–390.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Union soldiers entrenched along the west bank of the Rappahannock River at Fredericksburg, Virginia (111-B-157).jpg|thumb|Union soldiers before Marye's Heights, just prior to the [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg]] on May 3, 1863]]

Burnside, against the advice of the president, prematurely launched an offensive across the [[Rappahannock River]] and was stunningly [[Battle of Fredericksburg|defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg]] in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 429–431.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln brought in [[Joseph Hooker]], despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins 6:433–44&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1862|mid-term elections]] in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of ''habeas corpus'', [[Conscription|the military draft law]], and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Nevins vol 6 pp. 318–322, quote on p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York. The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states, except New York. The Cincinnati ''Gazette'' contended that the voters were "depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included attacks by Hooker on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans on Chattanooga, Grant on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 422–423.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooker was routed by Lee at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May,&lt;ref&gt;Nevins 6:432–450.&lt;/ref&gt; but continued to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee to do the same in [[Harper's Ferry]], and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by [[George Meade]], who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the [[Gettysburg Campaign]], which was a victory for the Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 444–447.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. Even so, he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emancipation Proclamation===
{{Main|Abraham Lincoln and slavery|Emancipation Proclamation}}

[[File:Emancipation proclamation.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''[[First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln]]'' by [[Francis Bicknell Carpenter]] (1864)|alt=A dark-haired, bearded, middle-aged man holding documents is seated among seven other men.]]

Lincoln understood that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At the beginning of the war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept [[compensated emancipation]] in return for their prohibition of slavery. Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it, as envisioned by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], under the constitution.&lt;ref name="Mackubin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp |title=The Liberator |first=Thomas Owens |last=Mackubin |date=March 25, 2004 |work=National Review |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62a7fJ9hj?url=http://old.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp |archivedate=October 20, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy |access-date=December 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C. Frémont in August 1861 and by Major General [[David Hunter]] in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Guelzo (1999), pp. 290–291.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 1862, endorsed by Lincoln, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. In July, the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]] was passed, which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion. Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress's power to free the slaves within the states, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander-in-Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution, and Lincoln was planning to take that action. In that month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet. In it, he stated that "as a fit and necessary military measure, on January 1, 1863, all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free".&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 364–365.&lt;/ref&gt;

Privately, Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated. However, Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. Republican editor [[Horace Greeley]] of the highly influential ''New York Tribune'' fell for the ploy,&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (1992), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22, 1862. Although he said he personally wished all men could be free, Lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as the U.S. president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his "official duty") was that of preserving the Union:&lt;ref&gt;Guelzo (2004), pp. 147–153.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union&amp;nbsp;... [¶] I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.&lt;ref&gt;Basler (1953), p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, and put into effect on January 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 364, 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.&lt;ref&gt;Louis P. Masur, ''Lincoln's Hundred Days: The Emancipation Proclamation and the War for the Union'' (Harvard University Press; 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: "I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper."&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up [[Abraham Lincoln on slavery#Colonization|colonies]] for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the [[War Governors' Conference]]; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins (1960), pp. 2:239–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to [[Andrew Johnson]], the military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, "The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once".&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 430–431.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General [[Lorenzo Thomas]] had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Douglass]] once observed of Lincoln: "In his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color".&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, pp. 259–260.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gettysburg Address (1863)===
{{Main|Gettysburg Address}}
[[File:Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, Gettysburg.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The only confirmed photo of Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg, some three hours before [[Gettysburg Address|the speech]]]]
With the great Union victory at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in July 1863, and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort, despite the [[New York City draft riots]]. The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 453–460.&lt;/ref&gt; Defying Lincoln's prediction that "the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here", the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.&lt;ref name="Bulla"&gt;Bulla (2010), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal". He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy in the world would be assured, that "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth". Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 460–466.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wills, pp. 20, 27, 105, 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Grant===
[[File:The Peacemakers 1868.jpg|alt=Painting of four men conferring in a ship's cabin, entitled "The Peacemakers".|thumb|upright=1.25|President Lincoln (center right) with, from left, Generals [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]] and [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] and Admiral [[David Dixon Porter|Porter]] in ''[[The Peacemakers]]'', an 1868 painting of events aboard the ''[[River Queen (steamboat)|River Queen]]'' in March 1865]]

Meade's failure to capture Lee's army as it retreated from Gettysburg, and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac, persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed. General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s victories at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and in the [[Vicksburg campaign]] impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, "I can't spare this man. He fights."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters, and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union'' (Vol. IV), pp. 6–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864, as McClellan was. Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant's political intentions, and being assured that he had none, submitted to the Senate Grant's promotion to commander of the Union Army. He obtained Congress's consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General, which no officer had held since George Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 490–492.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant waged his bloody [[Overland Campaign]] in 1864. This is often characterized as a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]], given high Union losses at battles such as the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]. Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive, the Confederate forces had "almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces".&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (2009), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army, and Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, to which the general replied, "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer."&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lee's army shrank with every costly battle. Grant's army moved south, crossed the [[James River]], forcing a [[Siege of Petersburg|siege]] and trench warfare outside [[Petersburg, Virginia]]. Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina.&lt;ref name="whitehousehistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html |title=The Peacemakers |publisher=The White House Historical Association |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62a8J9jOa?url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html |archivedate=October 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy |access-date=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North, and replaced the Union losses.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), pp. 422–424.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure—such as plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. Grant's move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South. This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and [[Philip Sheridan]] to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia's [[Shenandoah Valley]]. The damage caused by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a {{convert|60|mi|km|adj=on}} swath, but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal, but rather defeat of the Confederate armies. [[Mark E. Neely Jr.]] has argued that there was no effort to engage in "[[total war]]" against civilians which he believed did take place during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Neely (2004), pp. 434–458.&lt;/ref&gt;{{vague|date=December 2014}}

Confederate general [[Jubal Early]] began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital. During Early's [[Battle of Fort Stevens|raid on Washington, D.C.]] in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; Captain [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] shouted at him, "Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington, Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 516–518.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Grant continued to wear down Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President [[Alexander H. Stephens|Stephens]] led a group to meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at [[Hampton Roads Conference|Hampton Roads]]. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 565.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the [[Battle of Five Forks]] and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as he walked through the city, white Southerners were stone-faced, but [[freedmen]] greeted him as a hero. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]] and the war was effectively over.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1864 re-election===
{{Main|Electoral history of Abraham Lincoln|United States presidential election, 1864}}
[[File:1864 Electoral Map.png|thumb|alt=Map of the U.S. showing Lincoln winning all the Union states except for Kentucky, New Jersey, and Delaware. The Southern states are not included.|An [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral]] landslide for Lincoln (in red) in the 1864 election; southern states (brown) and territories (light brown) not in play]]

While the war was still being waged, Lincoln faced reelection in 1864. Lincoln was a master politician, bringing together—and holding together—all the main factions of the Republican Party, and bringing in [[War Democrats]] such as [[Edwin M. Stanton]] and Andrew Johnson as well. Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket.&lt;ref&gt;Fish, pp. 53–69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tegeder, pp. 77–90.&lt;/ref&gt; At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new [[National Union Party (United States)|Union Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 494–507.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Grant's 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted, the lack of military success wore heavily on the President's re-election prospects, and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Sharing this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:&lt;ref name="Grimsley, p. 80"&gt;Grimsley, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Basler (1953), p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.

While the Democratic platform followed the "Peace wing" of the party and called the war a "failure", their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of Grant in the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and [[David Farragut]]'s capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. By contrast, the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue, and state Republican parties stressed the [[perfidy]] of the Copperheads.&lt;ref&gt;Randall &amp; Current (1955), p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, Lincoln was re-elected in a landslide, carrying all but three states, and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers' vote.&lt;ref name="Grimsley, p. 80"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paludan, pp. 274–293.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abraham Lincoln second inaugural address.jpg|thumb|alt=A large crowd in front of a large building with many pillars.|Lincoln's second inaugural address in 1865 at the almost completed Capitol building]]

On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]]. In it, he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God's will. Historian [[Mark Noll]] concludes it ranks "among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Noll, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln said:

{{quote|Fondly do we hope—fervently do we pray—that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the [[wikt:bondman|bond-man's]] 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said 3,000 years ago, so still it must be said, "the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether". With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Lincoln, ''Abraham Lincoln: Selected Speeches and Writings'' (Library of America edition, 2009) p 450&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Reconstruction===
{{Main|Reconstruction Era}}
Reconstruction began during the war, as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states, and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. Shortly after Lee's surrender, a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, and Lincoln replied, "Let 'em up easy."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), pp. 509–512.&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with that sentiment, Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Rep. [[Thaddeus Stevens]], Sen. [[Charles Sumner]] and Sen. [[Benjamin Wade]], political allies of the president on other issues. Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war. His [[Ten percent plan|Amnesty Proclamation]] of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 471–472.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|alt=Cartoon of Lincoln and Johnson attempting to stitch up the broken Union|thumb|A political cartoon of Vice President Andrew Johnson (a former tailor) and Lincoln, 1865, entitled ''The 'Rail Splitter' At Work Repairing the Union''. The caption reads (Johnson): "Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever." (Lincoln): "A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended."]]

As Southern states were subdued, critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and [[Frederick Steele]] as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the [[Wade-Davis Bill]], in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 485–486.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness. To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the choice of the Radicals, Salmon P. Chase, who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union'', Vol IV., p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, which did not apply to every state, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment. Lincoln declared that such an amendment would "clinch the whole matter".&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; By December 1863, a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to Congress for passage. This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15, 1864, in the House of Representatives. Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864. After a long debate in the House, a second attempt passed Congress on January 31, 1865, and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 562–563.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/house-passes-the-13th-amendment |title=House passes the 13th Amendment – History.com This Day in History – 1/31/1865 |publisher=History.com |accessdate=November 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110065228/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/house-passes-the-13th-amendment |archive-date=November 10, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon ratification, it became the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] on December 6, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Primary Documents in American History: 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/13thamendment.html |publisher=Library of Congress |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62a9BIwNw?url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/13thamendment.html |archivedate=October 20, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy |access-date=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the war drew to a close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's [[Freedmen's Bureau]] bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (2003), pp. 242–243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what Lincoln would have done about Reconstruction if he had lived, but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen. Lincoln biographers [[James G. Randall]] and [[Richard Current]], according to David Lincove, argue that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lincove|first=David A.|title=Reconstruction in the United States: An Annotated Bibliography|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3EQcT7-Dpi0C&amp;pg=PA80|year= 2000|publisher=Greenwood|page=80|access-date=June 27, 2015|isbn=9780313291999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It is likely that had he lived, Lincoln would have followed a policy similar to Johnson's, that he would have clashed with congressional Radicals, that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred, and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnson's mistakes.}}

[[Eric Foner]] argues that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4b8m7cv3wTIC&amp;pg=PA335|year=2010|publisher=W. W. Norton|pages=334–36|access-date=June 27, 2015|isbn=9780393340662}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Unlike Sumner and other Radicals, Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. He believed, as most Republicans did in April 1865, that the voting requirements should be determined by the states. He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former Confederates. But time and again during the war, Lincoln, after initial opposition, had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and Radical Republicans.&amp;nbsp;... Lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves&amp;nbsp;... It is entirely plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing on a Reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage, along the lines Lincoln proposed just before his death.}}

===Redefining the republic and republicanism===

The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country. The term "the United States" has historically been used, sometimes in the plural ("these United States"), and other times in the singular, without any particular grammatical consistency. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Presidential Proclamation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/12/presidential-proclamation-civil-war-sesquicentennial |title=Presidential Proclamation-Civil War Sesquicentennial |publisher=The White House |date=April 12, 2011 |quote=...&amp;nbsp;a new meaning was conferred on our country's name&amp;nbsp;... |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62aAPoA6B?url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/12/presidential-proclamation-civil-war-sesquicentennial |archivedate=October 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy |access-date=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, historians such as Harry Jaffa, Herman Belz, John Diggins, Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln's redefinition of ''republican values''. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the "sheet anchor" of republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, in contrast to the Constitution's tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, "Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself."&lt;ref&gt;Diggins, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.&lt;ref&gt;Foner (2010), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Burton (2008) argues that Lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated.&lt;ref&gt;Orville Vernon Burton, ''The Age of Lincoln'' (2008) p 243&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1861, in Lincoln's [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|first inaugural address]], he explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system. He said "A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people."&lt;ref&gt;Belz (1998), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other enactments===
Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (2001), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; He signed the [[Homestead Act]] in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The [[Pacific Railway Acts]] of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which was completed in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Paludan, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (1993), pp. 450–452.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a new Federal income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third [[Morrill Tariff]], the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the [[Revenue Act of 1861]], creating the first U.S. income tax.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|800|1861|r=-2}}}} in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the [[Revenue Act of 1862]] to a progressive rate structure.&lt;ref&gt;Paludan, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in several other areas. The creation of the system of national banks by the [[National Banking Act]] provided a strong financial network in the country. It also established a national currency. In 1862, Congress created, with Lincoln's approval, the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]].&lt;ref name="Donald 2001 p. 424"&gt;Donald (2001), p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the "[[Dakota War of 1862|Sioux Uprising]]" in Minnesota. Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted [[Sioux#Santee (Isáŋyathi or Eastern Dakota)|Santee Dakota]] who were accused of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved).&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, pp. 210–232.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of Grant's casualties in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, but it was never issued. In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the ''[[New York World]]'' and the ''[[The Journal of Commerce|Journal of Commerce]]'' published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 501–502.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving holiday]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="Donald 1996, p. 471"&gt;Donald (1996), p. 471.&lt;/ref&gt; Before Lincoln's presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates. The last such proclamation had been during [[James Madison]]'s presidency 50 years before. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving.&lt;ref name="Donald 1996, p. 471"/&gt; In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as [[Yosemite National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schaffer|first=Jeffrey P.|title=Yosemite National Park: A Natural History Guide to Yosemite and Its Trails|publisher=Wilderness Press|page=48|location=Berkeley|year=1999|isbn=978-0-89997-244-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial appointments===
{{Main|List of federal judges appointed by Abraham Lincoln}}

====Supreme Court appointments====
[[File:Mathew Brady, Portrait of Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, officer of the United States government (1860–1865, full version).jpg|thumb|upright|Salmon Portland Chase was Lincoln's choice to be [[Chief Justice of the United States]].]]

* [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]] – 1862
* [[Stephen Johnson Field]] – 1863
* [[Salmon P. Chase|Salmon Portland Chase]] – 1864 (Chief Justice)

Lincoln's declared philosophy on court nominations was that "we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known."&lt;ref name="Donald 1996, p. 471"/&gt; Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court. [[Noah Haynes Swayne]], nominated January 21, 1862, and appointed January 24, 1862, was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. [[Samuel Freeman Miller]], nominated and appointed on July 16, 1862, supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis, Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860, nominated December 1, 1862, and appointed December 8, 1862, had also served as a judge in Lincoln's Illinois court circuit. [[Stephen Johnson Field]], a previous California Supreme Court justice, was nominated March 6, 1863, and appointed March 10, 1863, and provided geographic balance, as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;Blue, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other judicial appointments====
Lincoln appointed 32 federal judges, including four Associate Justices and one Chief Justice to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], and 27 judges to the [[United States district courts]]. Lincoln appointed no judges to the [[United States circuit court]]s during his time in office.&lt;ref name="FJCdotGOV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biographical Directory of Federal Judges|url=http://www.fjc.gov/public/home.nsf/hisj|website=Federal Judicial Center|accessdate=August 11, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730115701/http://www.fjc.gov/public/home.nsf/hisj|archivedate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FedJudgeListLincoln"&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal judges nominated by Abraham Lincoln|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Federal_judges_nominated_by_Abraham_Lincoln|website=BallotPedia|accessdate=August 11, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909092944/http://ballotpedia.org/Federal_judges_nominated_by_Abraham_Lincoln|archivedate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===States admitted to the Union===
[[West Virginia]], admitted to the Union June 20, 1863, contained the former north-westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union. As a condition for its admission, West Virginia's constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery. [[Nevada]], which became the third State in the far-west of the continent, was admitted as a free state on October 31, 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 300, 539.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination and funeral==

[[File:Lincoln assassination slide c1900.png|thumb|left|alt=Image of Lincoln being shot by Booth while sitting in a theater booth.|Shown in the presidential booth of Ford's Theatre, from left to right, are assassin [[John Wilkes Booth]], Abraham Lincoln, [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], [[Clara Harris]], and [[Henry Rathbone]]]]
Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by [[John Wilkes Booth]] on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending a play at [[Ford's Theatre]] as the American Civil War was drawing to a close. The assassination occurred five days after the surrender of Robert E. Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 586–587.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy)&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt; to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (2000), pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Learning that the President and Grant would be attending Ford's Theatre, Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at the theater, as well as Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their homes. Without his main bodyguard, [[Ward Hill Lamon]], Lincoln left to attend the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' on April 14. At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 594–597.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's bodyguard, John Parker, left Ford's Theater during intermission to drink at the saloon next door. The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony. Seizing the opportunity, Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13&amp;nbsp;pm, aimed at the back of Lincoln's head and fired at point-blank range, mortally wounding the President. Major [[Henry Rathbone]] momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Lincolns-Missing-Bodyguard.html |title=Lincoln's Missing Bodyguard |first=Paul |last=Martin |date=April 8, 2010 |work=Smithsonian Magazine |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62aAqLOzq?url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Lincolns-Missing-Bodyguard.html |archivedate=October 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy |access-date=October 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being on the run for 12 days, Booth was tracked down and found on a farm in Virginia, some {{convert|70|mi|km}} south of Washington. After refusing to surrender to Union troops, Booth was killed by Sergeant [[Boston Corbett]] on April 26.&lt;ref&gt;Steers, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 599.&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctor [[Charles Leale]], an Army surgeon, found the President unresponsive, barely breathing and with no detectable pulse. Having determined that the President had been shot in the head, and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought, he made an attempt to clear the blood clot, after which the President began to breathe more naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/report-first-doctor-reach-shot-lincoln-found-175353998.html |title=Report of first doctor to reach shot Lincoln found |access-date=June 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606173005/http://news.yahoo.com/report-first-doctor-reach-shot-lincoln-found-175353998.html |archive-date=June 6, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dying President was taken across the street to [[Petersen House]].

Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00&amp;nbsp;am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death. The late President lay in state in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21.

Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark A.

In the 1840s, Lincoln subscribed to the [[Doctrine of Necessity]], a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s, Lincoln believed in "providence" in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence.&lt;ref&gt;Grant R.

He wrote at this time that God "could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun, He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref&gt;Guelzo (1999), p. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
{{Main|Health of Abraham Lincoln}}
Several claims abound that Lincoln's health was declining before the assassination. These are often based on [[list of photographs of Abraham Lincoln|photographs]] appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting. One such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder, [[multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b|MEN2b]],&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Abraham|last=Verghese|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2009/05/was-lincoln-dying-before-he-was-shot/17955/ |title=Was Lincoln Dying Before He Was Shot? |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |publisher=[[Emerson Collective]]|location=Palo Alto, California|date=May 20, 2009|accessdate=October 8, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413145051/http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2009/05/was-lincoln-dying-before-he-was-shot/17955/ |archive-date=April 13, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; which manifests with a [[medullary thyroid carcinoma]], [[mucosal neuromata with endocrine tumors|mucosal neuromas]] and a [[marfanoid|Marfanoid appearance]]. Others simply claim he had [[Marfan syndrome]], based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers, and the association of possible [[aortic regurgitation]], which can cause bobbing of the head ([[De Musset's sign|DeMusset's sign]])&amp;nbsp;– based on blurring of Lincoln's head in photographs, which back then had a long exposure time. Confirmation of this and other diseases could possibly be obtained via DNA analysis of a pillow case stained with Lincoln's blood, currently in possession of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] Museum &amp; Library in Philadelphia, but {{As of|2009}}, the museum has refused to provide a sample for testing.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt;{{update inline|date=June 2018}}

In [[historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|surveys of U.S. scholars ranking presidents]]&lt;!--Lincoln is first in 9 of 17 on that page--&gt; conducted since the 1940s, Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three, often as number one.&lt;ref name="Ranking Our Presidents"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gallup"/&gt; A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name="Taranto"&gt;Taranto, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; In presidential ranking polls conducted in the United States since 1948, Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls.

President Lincoln's assassination increased his status to the point of making him a national martyr. Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability.&lt;ref&gt;Chesebrough, pp. 76, 79, 106, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have said he was "a [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]]" in the 19th century sense.

Lincoln became a favorite exemplar for liberal intellectuals across Europe and Latin America and even in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Richard|editor1-last=Carwardine|editor2-first=Jay|editor2-last=Sexton|title=The Global Lincoln|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gs_1lpJvF34C&amp;pg=PA54|year=2011|publisher=Oxford UP|location=Oxford, England|ISBN=9780195379112|pages=7, 9–10, 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwartz argues that Lincoln's American reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the [[Progressive Era]] (1900–1920s) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz (2000), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Deal]] era, liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they believed would have supported the [[welfare state]]. In the [[Cold War]] years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by [[Communist]] regimes.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz (2009), pp. 23, 91–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to [[Conservatism in the United States|political conservatives]]&lt;ref&gt;Havers, p. 96. Apart from neo-Confederates such as [[Mel Bradford]] who denounced his treatment of the white South.&lt;/ref&gt; for his intense nationalism, support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage, his acting in terms of [[John Locke|Lockean]] and [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Belz (2006), pp. 514–518.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graebner, pp. 67–94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 43–45.&lt;/ref&gt; As a Whig activist, Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, internal improvements, and railroads in opposition to the [[Jacksonian Democracy|agrarian Democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;Boritt (1994), pp. 196, 198, 228, 301.&lt;/ref&gt; William C. Harris found that Lincoln's "reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism".&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation "in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform". Randall concludes that, "he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders."&lt;ref&gt;Randall (1947), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s, some African American intellectuals, led by [[Lerone Bennett Jr.]], rejected Lincoln's role as the Great Emancipator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Arthur|last=Zilversmit|title=Lincoln and the Problem of Race: A Decade of Interpretations|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0002.104/--lincoln-and-the-problem-of-race-a-decade-of-interpretations?rgn=main;view=fulltext|journal=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Association|location=Springfield, Illinois|volume=2|issue=1|date=1980|pages=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=John M.|last=Barr|title=Holding Up a Flawed Mirror to the American Soul: Abraham Lincoln in the Writings of Lerone Bennett Jr.|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0035.105/--holding-up-a-flawed-mirror-to-the-american-soul-abraham?keywords=rgn...;rgn=main;view=fulltext|journal=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Association|location=Springfield, Illinois|volume=35|issue=1|date=Winter 2014|pages=43–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, pp. 35–42.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks. Bennett argued that Lincoln opposed social equality, and proposed [[American Colonization Society|sending freed slaves]] to another country. Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day;&lt;ref&gt;Dirck (2008), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and that he was a "moral visionary" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible.&lt;ref&gt;Striner, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Cashin, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelley &amp; Lewis, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln's image suffered "erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule" in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz (2009), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of [[negative capability]], defined by the poet [[John Keats]] and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were "content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason".&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, President [[Barack Obama]] named Lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using Lincoln's Bible for his swearing in to office at both his inaugurations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hirschkorn|first=Phil|title=The Obama-Lincoln Parallel: A Closer Look|website=[[CBS News]]|publisher=[[CBS Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=January 17, 2009|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-obama-lincoln-parallel-a-closer-look/|accessdate=January 26, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822114242/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-obama-lincoln-parallel-a-closer-look/|archivedate=August 22, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Jackson|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2013/01/10/obama-inaugural-bible-kennedy-king/1821363/ |title=Obama to be sworn in with Lincoln, King Bibles  |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Mclean, Virginia|date=January 10, 2013 |accessdate=March 2, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324044349/http://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2013/01/10/obama-inaugural-bible-kennedy-king/1821363/ |archive-date=March 24, 2015 |deadurl=no |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ed|last=Hornick|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/17/lincoln.obsession/index.html/|title=For Obama, Lincoln was model president|website=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|date=January 18, 2009|accessdate=August 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry Schwartz, a sociologist who has examined America's cultural memory, argues that in the 1930s and 1940s, the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with "a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life". During the [[Great Depression]], he argues, Lincoln served "as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful". Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, "What would Lincoln do?"&lt;ref&gt;Barry Schwartz, ''Abraham Lincoln in the Post-Heroic Era: History and Memory in Late Twentieth-Century America'' (2009) pp. xi, 9, 24&lt;/ref&gt; However, Schwartz also finds that since World War II, Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this "fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness". He suggested that [[postmodernism]] and [[multiculturalism]] have diluted greatness as a concept.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Schwartz, ''Abraham Lincoln in the Post-Heroic Era: History and Memory in Late Twentieth-Century America'' (2009) p. xi, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Navy]] {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|1}} {{USS|Abraham Lincoln|CVN-72}} is named after Lincoln, the second Navy ship to bear his name.

In [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]], '''assets''' are persons within organizations or countries being spied upon who provide information for an outside spy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Appel|first1=Edward|title=Recruiting and Operating Counterintelligence "Assets"|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/spy/counter/recruiting.html|website=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INTelligence: Human Intelligence|url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2010-featured-story-archive/intelligence-human-intelligence.html|website=www.cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ekpe|first1=Bassey|title=The Intelligence Assets of the United Nations: Sources, Methods, and Implications|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08850600701249709|website=tandfonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=S|first1=Ben|title=Intelligence Assets: What is an intelligence asset?|url=http://www.intelligence101.com/intelligence-assets-what-is-an-intelligence-asset/|website=intelligence101.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are sometimes referred to as agents, and in law enforcement parlance, as confidential informants, or "CIs" for short.

There are different categories of assets, including people who:

* Willingly work for a foreign government for ideological reasons such as being against their government, but live in a country that doesn't allow political opposition. They may elect to work with a foreign power to change their own country because there are few other ways available.
* Work for monetary gain. Intelligence services often pay good wages to people in important positions that are willing to betray secrets.
* Have been blackmailed and are forced into their role.
* Do not even know they are being used. Assets can be loyal to their country, but may still provide a foreign agent with information through failures in information safety, such as using insecure computers or not following proper [[Operations security (OPSEC)|OPSEC]] procedures during day-to-day chatting.

An '''authoritarian leadership style''' is exemplified when a [[leader]] dictates policies and procedures, decides what [[goal]]s are to be achieved, and directs and controls all activities without any meaningful participation by the subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;
Business Dictionary. (n.d). authoritarian leadership. Retrieved 2017-04-01, from  http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/authoritarian-leadership.html - "A leadership style in which the leader dictates policies and procedures, decides what goals are to be achieved, and directs and controls all activities without any meaningful participation by the subordinates."
&lt;/ref&gt;
Such a leader has full control of the [[team]], leaving low autonomy within the [[groups of people | group]].
The leader has a [[Foresight (psychology) | vision]] in mind and must be able to effectively motivate their group to finish the task.{{cn|date=April 2017}} The group is expected to complete the tasks under [[micromanagement | very close supervision]], while unlimited authority is self-bestowed by the leader. Subordinates' responses to the orders given are either punished or rewarded.

==Background==
Authoritarian leaders are commonly referred to as autocratic leaders. They sometimes, but not always, provide clear expectations for what needs to be done, when it should be done, and how it should be done. There is also a clear divide between the leader and the followers.&lt;ref name=Cherry&gt;Cherry, Kendra. "Lewin's Leadership Styles." About.com Psychology. Web. 14 Mar. 2012. &lt;http://psychology.about.com/od/leadership/a/leadstyles.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Altemeyer]] conducted research on what he labeled ''right-wing authoritarianism'' (RWA), and presented an analysis of the personality types of both the authoritarian leaders and the authoritarian followers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065260108603822 The Other “Authoritarian Personality”] by Bob Altemeyer Advances in Experimental Social PsychologyVolume 30, 1998, Pages 47-92&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarian leaders make decisions independently with little or no input from the rest of the group. Authoritarian leaders uphold stringent control over their followers by directly regulating rules, methodologies, and actions.  Authoritarian leaders construct gaps and build distance between themselves and their followers with the intention of stressing role distinctions.&lt;ref name=Hackman&gt;Hackman, M. Z., &amp; Johnson, C. E. (2009). Leadership: A Communication Perspective (5th ed.). Long Grove, IL, Waveland Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of leadership dates back to the earliest tribes and empires. It is often used in present-day when there is little room for error, such as construction jobs or manufacturing jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Leadership-Toolbox. (2008). Leadership Styles: Authoritarian Leadership. Retrieved November 15, 2013, from http://www.leadership-toolbox.com/autocratic-leadership.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarian leadership  typically fosters little creativity in decision-making. Lewin also found that it is more difficult to move from an authoritarian style to a democratic style than from a democratic form to an authoritarian form of leadership. Abuse of this style is usually viewed as controlling, bossy  and dictatorial. Authoritarian leadership is best applied to situations where there is little time for group discussion.&lt;ref name="Cherry" /&gt;

==Views of authoritarian leaders==
A common belief of many authoritarian leaders is that followers require direct supervision at all times, or else they would not operate effectively.&lt;ref name="Hackman" /&gt; This belief is in accordance with one of [[Douglas McGregor]]'s philosophical views of humankind, [[Theory X]].  This theory proposes that it is a leaders role to coerce and control followers, because people have an inherent aversion for work and will abstain from it whenever possible. Theory X also postulates that people must be compelled through force, intimidation or authority, and controlled, directed, or threatened with punishment in order to get them to accomplish the organizational needs.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, D. (2010). Theory x and theory y. Big Dog &amp; Little Dog’s Performance Juxtapostion. Retrieved March 26, 2012, from http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/history/xy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the minds of authoritarian leaders, people who are left to work autonomously will ultimately be unproductive.  “Examples of authoritarian communicative behavior include a police officer directing traffic, a teacher ordering a student to do his or her assignment, and a supervisor instructing a subordinate to clean a workstation.” &lt;ref name="Hackman" /&gt;

Communication Patterns of Authoritarian Leadership:&lt;ref name="Hackman" /&gt;

*Downward, one-way communication (i.e. leaders to followers, or supervisors to subordinates)
*Controls discussion with followers
*Dominates interaction
*Independently/unilaterally sets policy and procedures
*Individually directs the completion of tasks
*Does not offer constant feedback
*Rewards acquiescent obedient behavior and punishes erroneous actions
*Poor listener
*Uses conflict for individual gain

Ways to Properly Incorporate Authoritarian Leadership:

*Always explain rules- it allows your subordinates to complete the task you want done efficiently.
*Be consistent- if you are to enforce rules and regulations, make sure to do so regularly so your subordinates take you seriously. This will form a stronger level of trust.
*Respect your subordinates - always recognize your subordinates' efforts and achievements.
*Educate your subordinates before enforcing rules - do not present them with any surprises. This can lead to problems in the future due to false communication.
*Listen to suggestions from your subordinates, even if you do not incorporate them.

Effects of Authoritarian Leadership Communication Styles:&lt;ref name="Hackman" /&gt;

*Increase in productivity when leader is present &lt;ref&gt;Shaw, M. E. (1955). A comparison of two types of leadership in various communication nets. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 50,  127-134.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Produces more accurate solutions when leader is knowledgeable &lt;ref&gt;Cammalleri, J. A., Hendrick, H. W., Pittmen, W. C., Jr., Blout, H. D., &amp; Prather, D. C. (1973). Effects of different leadership styles on group accuracy.  Journal of Applied Psychology, 57, 32-37.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Is more positively accepted in larger groups &lt;ref&gt;Vroom, V. H., &amp; Mann, F. C. (1960).  Leader authorization and employee attitudes.  Personal Psychology, 13, 125-140.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Enhances performance on simple tasks and decreases performance on complex tasks &lt;ref&gt;Rudin, S. A. (1964).  Leadership as psychophysiological activation of group members: A case experimental study. Psychological Reports, 15, 577-578.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increases aggression levels among followers &lt;ref&gt;Day, R. C., &amp; Hamblin, R. L. (1964). Some effects of close and punitive styles of supervision. American Journal of Sociology, 69, 499-510.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increases turnover rates &lt;ref&gt;Ley, R. (1966), Labor turnover a function of worker differences, work environment, and  authoritarianism of foremen. Journal of Applied Psychology, 50, 497-500.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Successful when there is a time urgency for completion of projects
*Improves the future work of those subordinates whose skills are not very applicable or helpful without the demands of another &lt;ref&gt;Authoritarian Leadership: Use Sparingly! (n.d.). Retrieved November 15, 2013, from http://www.educational-business-articles.com/authoritarian-leadership.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Downfalls of Authoritarian Leadership:
*Long term use can cause resentment from subordinates. Use this form of leadership sparingly and when absolutely necessary
*It has been found by researchers that these type of leaders lack creative problem solving skills
*Without proper instruction and understanding from subordinates, confusion may arise

==Examples of Authoritarian Leaders==

[[Engelbert Dollfuss]], chancellor of Austria from 1932 to 1934, destroyed the [[Austrian Republic]] and established an authoritarian regime based on conservative Roman Catholic and Italian Fascist principles. In May 1932 when he became chancellor, Dollfuss headed a conservative coalition led by the Christian Social Party. When faced with a severe economic crisis caused by the Great Depression, Dollfuss decided against joining Germany in a customs union, a course advocated by many Austrians. Severely criticized by Social Democrats, Pan-German nationalists, and Austrian Nazis, he countered by drifting toward an increasingly authoritarian regime.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;Britannica. (n.d). Engelbert Dollfuss. Retrieved March 21, 2012 from, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/168274/Engelbert-Dollfuss&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] became Dollfuss' principal foreign ally. Italy guaranteed Austrian independence at Riccione (August 1933), but in return Austria had to abolish all political parties and reform its constitution on the Fascist model. In March 1933, Dollfuss’ attacks on Parliament culminated that September in the permanent abolition of the legislature and the formation of a corporate state based on his Vaterländische Front (“Fatherland Front”); with which he expected to replace Austria’s political parties. In foreign affairs he steered a course that converted Austria virtually into an Italian satellite state. Hoping therewith to prevent Austria’s incorporation into Nazi Germany, he fought his domestic political opponents along fascist-authoritarian lines.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

In February 1934 paramilitary formations loyal to the chancellor crushed Austria’s Social Democrats. With a new constitution of May 1934, his regime became completely dictatorial. In June, however, Germany incited the Austrian Nazis to civil war. Dollfuss was assassinated by the Nazis in a raid on the chancellery.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

One must be careful drawing similarities between political dictators and the authoritarian styles of non-politicians.  For example, one might argue--controversially--that [[Martha Stewart]] had an authoritarian style.  She constructed her empire through her own special attention to every detail.  She was meticulous, demanding, thorough and scrupulous. She flourished in her ventures and in using her authoritarian leadership style.&lt;ref&gt;Autocratic Leadership. (2010). Money-Zine.com. Retrieved March 23, 2012, from http://www.money-zine.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Autocratic leadership style works well if the leader is competent and knowledgeable enough to decide about each and everything. Authoritative is considered one of the most effective leadership styles in case there is some emergency and quick decisions need to be taken. [[Bill Gates]] adopted this style and has steered Microsoft toward great success. According to Bill Gates, he had a vision when he took reins of the company and then used all the resources available to make that vision a reality.In the personal computer workplace, many operating conditions call for urgent action, making this style of leadership effective. While Gates does not exhibit this style consistently, his success can be judged by his decision making process and the growth of the computer industry in the world.&lt;ref name=Gates&gt;{{cite web|last=Dogra|first=Aastha|title=Leadership Styles and Examples|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/leadership-styles-and-examples.html|publisher=Buzzle.com|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bush aznar Crawford 2003.jpg|thumb|Bush and Aznar at a public press conference in Crawford on February 22, 2003, the same day as the conversation documented in the memo]]
The '''Bush–Aznar memo''' is reportedly a documentation of a February 22, 2003 conversation in [[Crawford, Texas]] between [[US president]] [[George W. Bush]], [[Prime Minister of Spain]] [[José María Aznar]], [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[Daniel Fried]], [[Alberto Carnero]], and [[Javier Rupérez]], the Spanish ambassador to the U.S. [[British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] and [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]] [[Berlusconi]] participated by telephone. Rupérez transcribed the meeting's details which ''[[El País]]'', a Madrid daily newspaper, published on September 26, 2007.&lt;ref name="gomez"&gt;{{cite news|author=Edward M. Gomez|title=Secret memo revealed: Bush fixed on war, but could Saddam have been bought off?|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=15&amp;entry_id=20648|publisher=SFGate|accessdate=2007-09-28 | date=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversation focuses on the efforts of the US, UK, and Spain [[The UN Security Council and the Iraq war|to get a second resolution passed]] by the [[United Nations Security Council]].  This "second resolution" would have followed [[Resolution 1441]].  Supporters of the resolution also referred to it as the "eighteenth resolution" in reference to the 17 UN resolutions that [[Iraq]] had failed to comply with.

The memo provided insight into the run-up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. It revealed that [[Saddam Hussein]] had offered to step down and leave Iraq if he were allowed to keep $1 billion. Some have suggested that this indicates that the war was avoidable. The memo also possible motivations for members of the [[United Nations Security Council]] to support US policy: he tells Aznar that failures to support the resolution could endanger [[Angola]]'s [[foreign aid]] from the [[Millennium Challenge Account]] and the pending [[free trade agreement]] with [[Chile]] (awaiting ratification in the United States Senate at the time). Another portion of the transcript shows Bush's confidence in Iraq's stability after the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew War|title=New light cast on Bush's plans for Iraq war|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21017707/|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2007-09-28}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of the transcript==
The transcript begins with Bush saying he wants to pursue a second resolution quickly, two or three days after the meeting. Aznar prefers three days later so the [[General Affairs and External Relations Council]] can meet beforehand. Bush envisions a resolution similar to one passed during the Kosovo conflict, and "he wants it written so that it does not contain obligatory elements, that does not mention the use of force, and that states that Saddam Hussein has been unable to fulfill his obligations."

Aznar then asks if there will be another, parallel declaration. Condoleezza Rice responds that there will not.  Rice reiterates the desire for a simple resolution that would not include stages Hussein could use to stall. She also mentions that they are meeting with Hans Blix in an attempt to get information that could be used in the resolution.

Bush says that "Saddam Hussein won't change and he'll continue to play games. The time has come to get rid of him."  Bush says that they will proceed with the invasion even if the resolution is vetoed, but he believes they will be able to get the second resolution passed. Bush mentions that the coalition forces will be ready to invade in two weeks (second week of March 2003), and they expect to be in Baghdad by the end of March.

Bush goes on to discuss various possibilities of what will happen to Hussein.  He gives an estimated 15% chance that Hussein will be dead or gone by the time Baghdad falls. Bush reveals that Hussein seems to prefer exile over standing his ground, and that Hussein has told the Egyptians that he will leave Iraq if he can take $1 billion and information on weapons of mass destruction.

Bush continues to talk and moves to discussing post-invasion Iraq. He says that he expects Hussein's generals to put up resistances by blowing up infrastructure, especially oil wells. Bush says that invading forces will seize the oil wells very early on to prevent this. Meanwhile, he says Saudi Arabia will produce extra oil to cover any disruption in the oil market. Bush thinks they can "win without destruction," and that Iraq has good foundations including a strong bureaucracy and civil society. Bush envisions Iraq government by a federation.

Aznar returns the conversation to the resolution. Aznar wants the resolution to mention that Hussein has lost his chance.  Bush replies that he cares little about the content of the message, and Aznar responds that the Spanish will send the Americans some text for the resolution. Bush says they do not have a set text—only the requirement that Saddam be disarmed. Aznar says that his text will be written to draw more international support, and Bush consents. Aznar then discusses his upcoming meeting with President of France [[Jacques Chirac]] on February 26, shortly after the resolution is announced.  Bush says that Chirac thinks of himself as "Mr Arab," and that the two have a rivalry over the Arab world.

Aznar then returns to the subject of the UN inspectors' report. Rice answers that they do not expect to get much out of the report, and the Iraqis can be expected to show some minor steps of compliance to coincide with the report. Bush compares this waiting game to "[[Chinese water torture]]," and that he will not wait past the middle of March.

Bush says he will put pressure on countries to get their support. He says that failure to support the resolution could endanger foreign aid to Angola the ratification of a free trade agreement with Chile in the senate.

Aznar asks if there is a chance that Hussein will go into exile. Bush responds that it is a possibility, and another that Hussein may even be assassinated. Bush says Hussein expects to be able to not be prosecuted in exile but that it is expected that more of Hussein's hidden crimes will be discovered, and he would then be judged in international court in [[The Hague]].

Aznar says that the best outcome would be a bloodless victory. Bush, acknowledging the death and destruction of war, agrees. "Moreover, it would save $50 billion."

Aznar then asks Bush for help with boosting public (presumably Spanish) opinion. Bush responds that he will help by making a speech outlining his goals and putting the issue in a "higher context."  Aznar relates his concern that he is breaking with historical Spanish policy. Bush responds that he too is guided by history, and that he does not want history to judge him and say that he did not do his duty.  Also, he went to the Security Council when some in his administration sought to avoid the UN entirely.  Aznar tells Bush "Only your optimism worries me." Bush replies, "I am optimistic because I believe that I am in the right. I am at peace with myself. We have the job of confronting a serious threat to peace." Bush then implies that Europeans are shirking their duties because of racist attitudes. He then says he has a good relationship with Kofi Annan.

The transcript ends with Bush saying, "The more the Europeans attack me, the stronger I am in the United States." Aznar replies, "We must make your strength compatible with the esteem of the Europeans."

==Text&lt;ref&gt;http://www.juancole.com/2007/09/bush-aznar-transcript-war-crime-of.html&lt;/ref&gt;==
President Bush: We are in favor of getting a second resolution in the Security Council and would want to do it quickly. We would want to announce it Monday or Tuesday [24 or 25 of February 2003].

Prime minister Aznar: Better Tuesday, after the meeting of the Council of General Affairs of the European Union. It is important to maintain the momentum gained by the resolution at the summit of the European Union [in Brussels, Monday 17 of February]. We would prefer to wait until Tuesday.

Bush: It could be in the evening Monday, considering the time difference. In any case, the next week. We will see that the resolution is written so that it does not contain obligatory steps [for Iraq], that it does not mention the use of force, and that it states that Saddam Hussein has been unable to fulfill his obligations. That type of resolution can be voted for by many people. It would be something similar to the one passed regarding Kosovo [the 10th of June 1999].
Aznar: Would it be presented to the Security Council before, and independently of, a parallel declaration?

Condoleezza Rice: In fact there would not be parallel declaration. We are thinking about as simple a resolution as possible, without many details regarding [Iraq's] obligations–such that Saddam Hussein could use them as stages and consequently could neglect to fulfill them. We are speaking with Blix [head of the inspectors of the UN] and others of his team to get ideas that can serve to introduce the resolution.

Bush: Saddam Hussein will not change and will continue playing games. The moment has come to be rid of him. That's the way it is. As for me, from now on I will try to tone down the rhetoric as much as possible, while we seek approval of the resolution. If somebody uses a veto, we will go. [Russia, China and France have, along with the U.S.A. and the United Kingdom the right to a veto in the Security Council by virtue of being permanent members]
Saddam Hussein is not disarming. We have to take him right now. We have shown an incredible degree of patience so far. There are two weeks left. In two weeks we will be militarily ready. I believe that we will get the second resolution. In the Security Council we have the three African members [Cameroun, Angola and Guinea], the Chileans, and the Mexicans. I will speak with all of them, also with Putin, naturally. We will be in Baghdad at the end of March. There is a 15% possibility that Saddam Hussein will die or flee. But that possibility will not exist until we have demonstrated our resolve. The Egyptians are talking to Saddam Hussein. It seems that he has indicated that he is willing to go into exile if he can take a billion dollars with him and all the information that he wants on weapons of mass destruction. [Muammar] Gaddafi told Berlusconi that Saddam Hussein wants to go away. Mubarak tells us that in these circumstances it is entirely possible that he will be assassinated.
We would like to act with the mandate of the United Nations. If we act militarily we will do it with great precision, tightly focusing on our objectives. We will decimate the troops loyal to him, and the regular army quickly will recognize what is going on. We have sent a very clear message to Saddam's generals: we will treat them like war criminals. We know that they have accumulated an enormous amount of dynamite to demolish bridges and other infrastructure and to blow up the oil wells. We foresee occupying those wells very quickly. Also, the Saudis will help us by putting on the market all the petroleum that is necessary. We are developing a package of very extensive humanitarian aid. We can win without destruction. We are already planning for a post-Saddam Iraq, and I believe that there are good bases for a better future. Iraq has a relatively good bureaucracy and a civil society. It can be organized as a federal system. Meanwhile, we are doing everything possible to take care of the political needs of our friends and allies.

Aznar: It is very important to have a resolution. It is not the same to act with it as without it. It would be very advisable to have a majority in the Security Council that supported that resolution. In fact, it is important to have it passed by a majority, even if someone exercises a veto. Let us consider that the text of the resolution would have among other things to state that Saddam Hussein has lost his opportunity.

Bush: Yes, by all means. It would be better to have a reference to "necessary means" [a reference to the type of UN resolution that authorizes the use of "all necessary means"].
Aznar: Saddam Hussein has not cooperated, has not been disarmed; we would have to summarize his breaches and to send a more detailed message. That would allow, for example, Mexico to move [a reference to a change in its negative position on the second resolution, the extent of which Aznar could have known about from the lips of president Vicente Fox on Friday, February 21, in Mexico City].

Bush: The resolution will be custom-made in such a way that it will help you. I don't care much about the content.

Aznar: We will send you some sample texts.

Bush: We do not have any text. Only a criterion: that Saddam Hussein disarm. We cannot allow Saddam Hussein to drag things out until the summer. After all, this last stage has already lasted four months, and this is more than enough time to disarm.

Aznar: Having a text would allow us to sponsor it and to be its coauthors, and to arrange for many others to sponsor it.

Bush: Perfect.

Aznar: The next Wednesday [(2)6 of February] I will meet with Chirac. The resolution will already have begun to circulate.

Bush: It seems to me all very good. Chirac knows the reality perfectly. Their intelligence services have explained it to him. The Arabs are transmitting a very clear message to Chirac: Saddam Hussein must go. The problem is that Chirac thinks he is Mister Arab, but in fact he is making their lives impossible. But I do not want to have any rivalry with Chirac. We have different points of view, but I would like that to be all. Give him my best regards. Really! The less rivalry he feels exists between us, the better it will be for everyone.

Aznar: How to combine the resolution with the report of the inspectors?

Condoleezza Rice: Actually there will not be a report on February 28, but the inspectors will present a report written on March 1. We don't have high hopes for that report. As with the previous ones, it will be a mixed picture. I have the impression that Blix will now be more negative than he was before, with regard to the Iraqis' intentions. After the appearance of the inspectors before the Council, we must anticipate a vote on the resolution one week later. The Iraqis, meanwhile, will try to explain that they are fulfilling their obligations. It isn't true, and it won't be sufficient, though they may announce the destruction of some missiles.

Bush: This is like Chinese water torture. We must put an end to it.

Aznar. I agree, but it would be good to have the maximum possible number of people. Have a little patience.

Bush: My patience is exhausted. I don't intend to wait longer than the middle of March.

Aznar: I do not request that you have infinite patience. Simply that you do everything possible so that it all works out.

Bush: Countries like Mexico, Chile, Angola, and Cameroon must realize that what's at stake is the security of the United States, and they should act with a sense of friendship toward us. [Chilean President Ricardo] Lagos should know that the Free Trade Accord with Chile is awaiting Senate confirmation and a negative attitude about this could put ratification in danger. Angola is receiving Millennium Account funds [to help alleviate poverty] and that could be jeopardized also if he's not supportive. And Putin must know that his attitude is putting in danger the relations of Russia with the United States.

Aznar: Tony [Blair] would like to wait until the 14th of March.

Bush: I prefer the 10th. This is like a game of bad cop, good cop. I don't mind being the bad cop, and Blair can be the good one.

Aznar: Is it certain that any possibility exists that Saddam Hussein will go into exile?

Bush: The possibility exists, including that he will be assassinated.

Aznar: Exile with a guarantee?

Bush: No guarantee. He is a thief, a terrorist, a war criminal. Compared with Saddam, Milosevic would be a Mother Teresa. When we go in, we are going to discover many more crimes and we will take him to the Court the International Justice. Saddam Hussein thinks that he has already escaped. He thinks that France and Germany have ceased fulfilling their responsibilities. He also thinks that the demonstrations of the last week [Saturday, February 15] will protect him. And he thinks that I very am weak. But the people around him know that the things are otherwise. They know that his future is in exile or a coffin. For that reason it is very important to maintain the pressure on him. Gaddafi tells us through back channels that that is the only thing that can finish him off. Saddam Hussein's only strategy is to delay, to delay and to delay.

Aznar: In fact the biggest success would be to win the game without firing a single shot and entering Baghdad.

Bush: For me it would be the perfect solution. I do not want war. I know what wars are. I know the destruction and the death that they bring with them. I am the one who has to console the mothers and the widows of the dead. By all means, for us that would be the best solution. In addition, it would save $50 billion.

Aznar: We need you to help us with our public opinion.

Bush: We will do everything we can. Wednesday I am going to speak on the situation in the Middle East, proposing the new peace plan with which you are familiar, and on weapons of mass destruction, on the benefits of a free society, and I will locate the history of Iraq in a wider context. Perhaps it will serve you.

Aznar: What we are doing is a very deep change for Spain and the Spaniards. We are changing the policy that the country had followed for the past two hundred years.
Bush: A historical sense of responsibility guides me just as it does you. When within a few years History judges us, I do not want people to ask themselves why Bush, or Aznar, or Blair did not face their responsibilities. In the end, what people want is to enjoy freedom. Recently, in Romania they reminded me of the example of Ceausescu: it was enough for a woman to call him a liar, for the entire repressive edifice to come down. It is the uncontrollable power of freedom. I am convinced that I will get the resolution.

Aznar: All to the good.

Bush: I made the decision to go to the Security Council. In spite of the disagreements in my Administration, I said to my people that we had to work with our friends. It will be wonderful to get a second resolution.

Aznar: The only thing that worries me about you is your optimism.

Bush: I am optimistic because I believe that I am in the right. I am at peace with myself. It has been up to us to face a serious threat to the peace. It irritates me a great deal to consider the indifference of the Europeans to the sufferings that Saddam Hussein inflicts on Iraqis. Perhaps because he is brown-skinned, far away, and Muslim, many Europeans think that everything is all right in his regard. I will not forget what Solana once said to me: why do we Americans think that the Europeans are anti-Semitic and unable to confront their responsibilities? That defensive attitude is terrible. I have to acknowledge I have just great relations with Kofi Annan.

Aznar: He shares your ethical preoccupations.

Bush: The more the Europeans attack me, the stronger I am in the United States.

Aznar: We would like to make your strength compatible with the esteem of the Europeans.

'''Crosskart''' or '''off-road kart''' is a type of [[kart racing]] that takes place on [[FIA Autocross|autocross]], [[rallycross]], [[Dirt track racing|dirt oval]] or [[ice racing]] tracks instead of on paved tracks.

Competitions take place in classes that are based on cylinder volume (125 cc, 250 cc, or 650 cc).  The 125 cc class is a junior class, open to those 12 years of age and older, but one can begin training at age 10.  The 250 cc, and 650 cc classes are open to people above 16 years of age.

Erland Andersson of Sweden is said to have invented the Crosskart in the early 1980s.  The idea was to create something that is safe, cheap, and easy to maintain, but still fun to ride. The Crosskart is basically a simplified version of [[Sprint car racing|Sprint car]], [[Midget car racing|Midget Car]] and [[Mini sprint]]

Crosskarting is probably most popular in the Nordic countries, although in southern Europe a similar motorsport with more powerful engines, Kartcross, exists.

According to their website, the events were initially created for friends who were too intimidated to attend Mihalko's informal massage workshops.  Upon publication of the Cuddle Party website, the events were opened to the general public, and, thanks to a swarm of media attention, became a phenomenon in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20145571,00.html |title=People |publisher=People |date=2004-09-27 |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klonick |first=Kate |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=2690511&amp;page=1 |title=ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2006-11-30 |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.observer.com/node/49525 New York Observer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011110421/http://www.observer.com/node/49525 |date=October 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2002025448_cuddleside05.html |title=Seattle Times |publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=2004-09-05 |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diamond''' was, according to legend, Sir [[Isaac Newton]]'s favourite dog, which, by upsetting a candle, set fire to manuscripts containing his notes on experiments conducted over the course of twenty years. According to one account, Newton is said to have exclaimed: "O Diamond, Diamond, thou little knowest the mischief thou hast done."&lt;ref name = Hall&gt;Alfred Rupert Hall, ''Isaac Newton: Eighteenth Century Perspectives'', Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 175. {{ISBN|0-19-850364-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The story is largely apocryphal: according to another account, Newton simply left a window open when he went to church, and the candle was knocked over by a gust of wind.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Socrates Bardi, ''The Calculus Wars: Newton, Leibniz, and the Greatest Mathematical Clash of All Times''. Thunder's Mouth Press, 2006, p. 159. {{ISBN|1-56025-706-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some historians claim that Newton never owned pets.&lt;ref name = Hall /&gt;

The story of "Newton's Mischief" has been reproduced over the centuries as early as 1833 in "The Life of Sir Isaac Newton"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9fQ4AAAAMAAJ The Life of Sir Isaac Newton]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[David Brewster]] and later in ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15331/15331-h/15331-h.htm St. Nicholas Magazine, Vol. 5, No. 4, (February 1878)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816 [[Walter Scott]] used the story in the third of his ''[[Waverley Novels]]'', ''[[The Antiquary]]'' (volume 2, chapter 1).

This pet of Newton's was also mentioned in [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s book ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]'', employed in discussing the deathbed of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. Carlyle writes "To the eye of History many things, in that sick room of Louis, are now visible, which to the [[courtiers]] there present were invisible. For indeed it as been well said, 'in every object there is inexhaustible meaning; the eye sees in it what the eye brings means of seeing.' To Newton and to Newton's dog Diamond, what a different pair of Universes; while the painting on the optical retina of both was, most likely, the same!"

Nevertheless, Diamond is the subject of several [[anecdote]]s concerning Newton. In another tale, Newton is said to have claimed that the dog discovered two theorems in a single morning. He added, however, that "one had a mistake and the other had a [[Pathological (mathematics)|pathological exception]]."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://sheppardsoftware.com/content/animals/animals/breeds/dogtopics/dog_history.htm Historical Canines]," Shepherd Software.

'''Drunk driving''' is the act of operating a [[motor vehicle]] with the operator's ability to do so impaired as a result of [[alcohol intoxication|alcohol consumption]], or with a blood alcohol level in excess of the legal limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Driving While Impaired - Alcohol and Drugs|url=https://www.ncadd.org/about-addiction/driving-while-impaired-alcohol-and-drugs|website=NCADD|publisher=National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, Inc.|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For drivers 21 years or older, driving with a [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) of 0.08% or higher is illegal. For drivers under 21 years old, the legal limit is lower, with state limits ranging from 0.00 to 0.02.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DUI Under 21 Laws by State|url=http://dui.findlaw.com/dui-laws-resources/dui-under-21-laws-by-state.html|website=FindLaw|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower BAC limits apply when operating boats, airplanes, or commercial vehicles. Among other names, the criminal offense of drunk driving may be called [[driving under the influence]] ('''DUI'''), driving while intoxicated or impaired ('''DWI'''), or operating while impaired ('''OWI''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Drunk Driving Terminology|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/drunk_driving/Drunk_Terminology.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
According to the [[United States Bureau of Justice Statistics|Bureau of Justice Statistics]], approximately 1.5 million drunk driving arrests were made nationwide in 1996. In 2012, 29.1 million people admitted to driving under the influence of alcohol.&lt;ref name="samhsa.gov"&gt;[http://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUHresults2012/NSDUHresults2012.pdf Results from the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Summary of National Findings].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 an estimated 513,200 DUI offenders were under correctional supervision, down from 593,000 in 1990 and up from 270,100 in 1986.&lt;ref name="usdoj2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/dwiocs.pdf|title=DWI Offenders under Correctional Supervision |date=June 1999 |website=United States Bureau of Justice Statistics |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609071051/http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/dwiocs.pdf |archive-date=2010-06-09 |first=Laura M. |last=Maruschak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Bureau of Justice Statistics|Bureau of Justice Statistics]] estimated that in 1996 local law enforcement agencies made 1,467,300 arrests nationwide for driving under the influence of alcohol, 1 out of every 10 arrests for all crimes in the U.S., compared to 1.9 million such arrests during the peak year in 1983, accounting for 1 out of every 80 licensed drivers in the U.S.&lt;ref name="usdoj1998"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/press/AC.PR |title=Four in Ten Criminal Offenders Report Alcohol as a Factor in Violence: But Alcohol-Related Deaths and Consumption in Decline |date=April 5, 1998 |website=United States Bureau of Justice Statistics |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528052705/http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/press/AC.PR |archive-date=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="problems"&gt;{{cite book | title= Alcohol Problems in the United States: Twenty Years of Treatment Perspective | first1= Thomas F. | last1= McGovern | first2= William L. | last2= White | year= 2003 | publisher= Routledge | isbn= 978-0-7890-2049-9 | page= 86 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3gRwmYohuooC&amp;pg=PA86}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represented a 220% increase in DUI arrests from 1970 to 1986, while the number of licensed drivers increased by just 42% in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Drunken-driving arrests up 220 percent since 1970 | first= Pete | last= Yost | work= [[Christian Science Monitor]] | agency= Associated Press | date= March 1, 1988 | url= http://www.csmonitor.com/1988/0301/afill01a.html | accessdate= 10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrest rate for alcohol-related offenses among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] was more than double that for the total population during 1996, and almost 4 in 10 Native Americans held in local jails had been charged with a public order offense, most commonly driving while intoxicated.&lt;ref name="usdoj1999"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/press/AIC.PR|title=American Indians are Violent Crime Victims at Double the Rate of General Population |date=February 19, 1999 |website=United States Bureau of Justice Statistics |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509042647/http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/press/AIC.PR |archive-date=2011-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, 29.1 million people admitted to driving under the influence of alcohol.&lt;ref name="samhsa.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Traffic Safety Facts 2004"&gt;[http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/TSF2004.PDF Traffic Safety Facts 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721035217/http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/TSF2004.PDF |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent analysis have shown cities in which ride sharing services operate show mixed results as to whether the availability of those services affects rates of impaired driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fortin|first1=Jacey|title=Does Uber Really Prevent Drunken Driving?

The [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]] estimates that about 18,000 people died in 2006 from [[Alcohol-related traffic crashes in the United States|"alcohol-related"]] collisions, representing 40% of total [[traffic]] [[death]]s in the US. Over the decade 2001-2010, this rate showed only a 3% variation, and no trend.&lt;ref name="rita-ddbtn"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chambers|first1=Matthew|last2=Lieu|first2=Mindy|last3=Moore|first3=Chip|title=Drunk Driving by the Numbers|url=https://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/by_the_numbers/drunk_driving/index.html|website=Bureau of Transportation Statistics|publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drivers with a BAC of 0.10% are 6 to 12 times more likely to get into a fatal crash or injury than drivers without positive blood alcohol.&lt;ref name="grandrapids"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NTHSA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.nhtsa.gov/"&gt;[http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/nti/pdf/811456.pdf NHTSA Digest of Impaired Driving and Select Beverage Control Laws]&lt;/ref&gt;  The NHTSA states 275,000 were injured in [[Alcohol-related traffic crashes in the United States|alcohol-related]] accidents in 2003.&lt;ref name="dot809775"/&gt; Approximately 60% of the BAC values for motor vehicle accidents are missing or unknown. To analyze what they believe is the complete data, statisticians estimate BAC information.&lt;ref name="www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Transitioning to Multiple Imputation – A New  Method to Impute Missing Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) values in FARS|url=https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/809403|website=NHTSA|publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NHTSA defines fatal collisions as "alcohol-related" if they believe the driver, a passenger, or non-motorist (such as a pedestrian or pedal cyclist) had a [[blood alcohol content]] (BAC) of 0.01% or greater. The NHTSA defines nonfatal collisions as alcohol-related if the accident report indicates evidence of alcohol present, even if no driver or occupant was tested for alcohol.&lt;ref name="Traffic Safety Facts 2004"/&gt; The NHTSA specifically notes that alcohol-related does not necessarily mean a driver or non-occupant was tested for alcohol and that the term does not indicate a collision or fatality was caused by the presence of alcohol.&lt;ref name="Traffic Safety Facts 2004"/&gt; If anyone involved in the accident (even a passenger) has a BAC of 0.01% of greater, then the NTHSA classifies the accident as alcohol-related.&lt;ref name="Traffic Safety Facts 2004"/&gt; Alcohol-related injuries were estimated at 275,000 in 2003.&lt;ref name="dot809775"&gt;DOT HS 809775, a.k.a. Traffic Safety Facts 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws and regulations==
For the most part, DUI or DWI are synonymous terms that represent the criminal offense of operating (or in some jurisdictions merely being in physical control of) a motor vehicle while being under the influence of alcohol or drugs or a combination of both. The key inquiry focuses on whether the driver's faculties were impaired by the substance that was consumed. The detection and successful prosecution of drivers impaired by prescription medication or illegal drugs can therefore be difficult. [[Breathalyzer]]s have been developed for the purpose of administering roadside or laboratory tests that can detect the actual level of a controlled substance in an individual's body.

===History===
[[File:Don't Mix 'Em 1937.jpg|thumb|left|1937 [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] drunk driving poster]]
New Jersey enacted the first law that specifically criminalized driving an automobile while intoxicated, in 1906. The New Jersey statute provided that "[n]o intoxicated person shall drive a motor vehicle." Violation of this provision was punishable by a fine of up to $500, or a term of up to 60 days in county jail.&lt;ref&gt;An Act Defining Motor Vehicles and Providing for the Registration of Same, 1906 N.J. Laws ch. 113, §§ 19, 35, p. 177, 186 (April 12, 1906)&lt;/ref&gt;

Early laws, such as that enacted in New Jersey, required proof of a state of intoxication with no specific definition of what level of inebriation qualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=H. Laurence Ross |author2=Joseph R. Gusfield |title=Confronting Drunk Driving |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7YIkcUqVdF8C |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1994 |ISBN=0-300-05865-9 |accessdate=2009-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first generally accepted legal BAC limit was 0.15%. New York, for example, which had enacted a prohibition on driving while intoxicated in 1910,&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Stats 1910, ch. 374, p. 673, 683 § 290 (May 31, 1910)&lt;/ref&gt; amended this law in 1941 to provide that it would constitute prima facie evidence of intoxication when an arrested person was found to have a BAC of .15 percent or higher, as ascertained through a test administered within two hours of arrest.&lt;ref&gt;An Act to Amend  the Vehicle and Traffic Law, 1941 N.Y. Laws ch. 726, § 1, p. 1623 (Apr. 25, 1941)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, the American Medical Association created a "Committee to Study Problems of Motor Vehicle Accidents". At the same time, the [[National Safety Council]] set up a "Committee on Tests for Intoxication".

In the US, most of the laws and penalties were greatly enhanced starting in the late 1970s, and through the 1990s, largely due to pressure from groups like [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD) and [[Students Against Destructive Decisions]] (SADD) and leaders like [[Candy Lightner]]. Significantly, [[zero tolerance]] laws were enacted which criminalized driving a vehicle with 0.01% or 0.02% BAC for drivers under 21. This is true even in Puerto Rico, despite maintaining a legal drinking age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inform.com/article/Puerto%20Rico%20OKs%20one%20lowest%20drunk-driving%20limits Puerto Rico OKs one lowest drunk-driving limits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029224040/http://inform.com/article/Puerto%20Rico%20OKs%20one%20lowest%20drunk-driving%20limits |date=2015-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2013, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] recommended that all 50 states lower the [[benchmarking|benchmark]] for determining when a driver is legally drunk from 0.08 blood-alcohol content to 0.05. The idea is part of an initiative to eliminate drunk driving, which accounts for about a third of all road deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Make DUI limit 0.05% blood-alcohol level, NTSB says|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/14/national-transportation-safety-board-drunken-driving/2158107/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=14 May 2013|first1=Bart|last1=Jansen|date=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of this push by the NTSB, and in addition to numerous media reports, many bloggers/authors have posted content addressing the Debate Surrounding Lowering the Legal Limit from 0.08% to 0.05%.

===Federal law===
After the passage of federal legislation, the legal limit for commercial drivers is now set at 0.04%. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulation prohibits those who hold a commercial driver's license from driving with an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater. A commercial driver with an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04, must be removed from duty for 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===State law===

In construing the terms DUI, DWI, OWI and OVI, some states make it illegal to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence or driving while intoxicated while others indicate that it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle. There is a split of authority across the country regarding this issue. Some states permit enforcement of DUI, DWI, and OWI/OVI statutes based on "operation and control" of a vehicle, while others require actual "driving". "The distinction between these terms is material, for it is generally held that the word 'drive,' as used in statutes of this kind, usually denotes movement of the vehicle in some direction, whereas the word 'operate' has a broader meaning so as to include not only the motion of the vehicle, but also acts which engage the machinery of the vehicle that, alone or in sequence, will set in motion the motive power of the vehicle." (''State v. Graves'' (1977) 269 S.C. 356 [237 S.E.2d 584, 586-588, 586. fn. 8]

Every state in the U.S. designates a "''per se"'' [[blood]] or [[breath]] alcohol level as the threshold point for an independent criminal offense. This is often referred to as the "legal limit". It is a permissive presumption of guilt where the person's BAC is 0.08% or greater (units of milligrams per deciliter, representing 8 g of alcohol in 10 liters of blood).&lt;ref name="NY DWI law"&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [[New York Penal Law]] section 1192, found at [http://www.assembly.state.ny.us New York State Assembly web site], go to "Bill Search and Legislative Materials", then "New York State Laws". Accessed April 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some states (e.g., Colorado) include a lesser charge, sometimes referred to as "driving while ability impaired" that may apply to individuals with a 0.05% or above, but less than the 0.08% per se limit for the more serious charge.&lt;ref name="NY DWI law"/&gt;

Every state has a "catch-all" provision designed to cover those circumstances where the person is below 0.08%, but the person still appears impaired by definition of law. These types of "catch-all" statutes cover situations involving a person under the influence of drugs or under the combined influence of alcohol and drugs. With the advent of the legalization of marijuana, these catch-all provisions cover those prosecutions pursuing those charged with driving under the influence of drugs or even drugs and alcohol.

All [[U.S. state|US states]] have [[implied consent]] laws which state that a licensed driver has given their consent to an evidential [[Breathalyzer]] or similar manner of determining [[blood alcohol concentration]];&lt;ref name="nolo_ref-long"&gt;[https://dui.drivinglaws.org/resources/dui-refusal-blood-breath-urine-test.htm DUI: Refusal to Take a Field Test, or Blood, Breath or Urine Test], NOLO Press ("As a general rule (and unlike chemical testing), there is no legal penalty for refusing to take these tests although the arresting officer can typically testify as to your refusal in court.")&lt;/ref&gt; however, in order to sustain a conviction based on evidence from a chemical test, [[Probable cause|probable cause for arrest]] must be demonstrated.

In 2016, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in [[Birchfield v. North Dakota]] held that both breath tests and blood tests constitute a search under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], concluding that requiring breath tests is constitutional without a search warrant; however, requiring more intrusive blood tests involving piercing the skin is not, as the goal of traffic safety can be obtained by less invasive means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marimow|first1=Ann E.|title=Supreme Court requires warrants for some, but not all drunken-driving tests|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/supreme-court-requires-warrants-for-some-but-not-all-drunk-driving-tests/2016/06/23/fa1033dc-395f-11e6-a254-2b336e293a3c_story.html|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=1 September 2017|date=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every state has enhanced penalties for refusing to submit to an Implied Consent Test pursuant to the State's Implied Consent Laws. In California, refusing to submit to a test of one's breath or blood upon being arrested for driving under the influence carries an additional punishment of a one-year license suspension pursuant to California Vehicle Code Section 13558(c)(1).&lt;ref&gt;http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=13558&amp;lawCode=VEH&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arizona====
[[Arizona]] has a 0.08% BAC limit for standard DUI, but drivers can also face more severe DUI charges like an Extreme DUI (§ 28-1382(A)(1)) for having a BAC over 0.15% or Super Extreme DUI (§ 28-1382(A)(2)) for a BAC over 0.20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azgohs.gov/programs/default.asp?ID=14|title=Arizona DUI Laws|website=Arizona Governor's Office of Highway Safety|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
{{main|DUI laws in California}}
Like every other state, [[California]] has a "per se" BAC limit of 0.08% pursuant to California Vehicle Code Section 23152(b); and based on the aforementioned federal legislation, a lower limit of 0.04% for drivers holding commercial drivers licenses ([[Commercial driver's license|CDL]]), along with rideshare drivers having a limit of 0.04%.&lt;ref&gt;http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB2687&lt;/ref&gt; California also has a limit of 0.01% for drivers who are under 21 or on probation for previous DUI offenses pursuant to California Vehicle Code Sections 23136 and 23140. California also makes it illegal for persons who are on probation for a DUI conviction to drive with a blood or breath alcohol concentration of 0.01% or greater pursuant to Vehicle Code Section 23154. While the existence of a BAC of 0.01% or greater may not always result in prosecution for driving under the influence, it will expose such drivers to a one or two-year suspension through an administrative action by the California Department of Motor Vehicles. If that same person has a BAC of 0.08% or greater, it will prompt what is referred to as a "dual action", meaning a suspension for driving with a BAC of 0.08% or greater and a suspension for driving with a BAC of 0.01% or greater while on DUI Probation.

In California, in ''Mercer v. DMV'' (1991) 53 Cal.3d 753,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/mercer-v-department-motor-vehicles-31352|title=Mercer v. Department of Motor Vehicles - 53 Cal.3d 753 S017249 - Mon, 05/06/1991 {{!}} California Supreme Court Resources|website=scocal.stanford.edu|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the California State Supreme Court contrasted the term "drive," commonly understood to require volitional movement of the vehicle, with the term "driver," defined in California Vehicle Code § 305 as one who is either driving or in actual physical control. The court pointed out that the phrase "actual physical control" does not appear anywhere in the drunk driving offense statutes. Further, the court noted that since "driver" is defined as one who drives or is in actual physical control, the two terms (drive vs. actual physical control) must have different meanings. Construing these penal statutes strictly, rather than broadly, as is required by ''Keeler v. Superior Court of Amador County'' (1970) 2 Cal.3d 619, 631, the court held that mere actual physical control is not enough to constitute driving. Therefore, the term: "drive", at least for purposes of the drunk driving statutes, requires volitional movement of the vehicle. In coming to this conclusion, the California Supreme Court held that in everyday usage the phrase, "to drive a vehicle," is understood as requiring evidence of volitional movement of a vehicle. Numerous dictionary definitions-including Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1981), cited by the Court of Appeal in the case that led to the California Supreme Court's review of this case, support a definition of "drive" that includes movement. (See, e.g., ''Id''., at p.&amp;nbsp;692.) fn. 5. The ''Mercer'' Court held that it believed that these definitions are consistent with the usual and ordinary understanding of that term, and suggest the sense in which the word was intended by the Legislature in the present context.

California's "catch-all" provision was previously found in California Vehicle Code Section 23152(a); however new statutes that were made effective on January 1, 2014, two new sections were created to make sections specifically addressing those charged with driving under the influence of drugs, (which includes prescription medications if it can be shown that those medications impaired the driver), and driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. 
* CVC 23152(a):  It is unlawful for any person who is under the influence of any alcoholic beverage or drug, or under the combined influence of any alcoholic beverage and drug, to drive a vehicle
* CVC 23152(b):  It is unlawful for any person who has 0.08 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a vehicle.
* CVC 23152(e):  It is unlawful for a person who is under the influence of any drug to drive a vehicle
* CVC 23152(f):  It is unlawful for a person who is under the combined influence of any alcoholic beverage and drug to drive a vehicle.

====Ohio====
First offenders in Ohio have their driver's licenses suspended for one year. They may begin driving again only halfway through this period if they use an [[ignition interlock device]] that tests their blood alcohol before it will allow the car to start. Judges may look at up to ten years of driving records during sentencing. These enhancements took effect in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rotuno-Johnson |first1=Michelle |title=New Ohio law designed to stop repeat drunk drivers goes into effect |url=http://www.nbc4i.com/local-news/new-ohio-law-designed-to-stop-repeat-drunk-drivers-goes-into-effect/1064708304 |accessdate=11 June 2018 |agency=WCMH-TV Columbus |publisher=NBC4i.com |date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nevada====
[[Nevada]] has an implied consent law, an agreement every motor vehicle license recipient must accept, that makes breath or blood testing mandatory if an officer has reasonable suspicion of impairment. Refusal is grounds for arrest and law enforcement may use reasonable force to obtain blood samples&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shaw |first1=Brandon |title=Nevada DUI Laws |url=http://abcdriveronline.com/dui-laws-of-nevada/ |website=ABC DUI |publisher=Shaw Education Developments |accessdate=21 February 2015 |ref=DUI Implied Consent Law |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221100901/http://abcdriveronline.com/dui-laws-of-nevada/ |archivedate=21 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wisconsin====
Wisconsin regards first offense drunk driving as a [[municipal offense]], and New Jersey treats all drunk driving cases without serious injury or death as traffic violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:MGc4MN8Zf3IJ:www.ncsl.org/print/transportation/drunkdrivecriminal.pdf+new+jersey+wisconsin+drunk+driving+%22not+a+crime%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShQuAqpiha94s1XME_DhE5vm9ecBgosdeozIFW6LyP7LQ0cRM_63NrFuAXw6hUmmGmZIyQiyBs6R069QLeRoO4abRTryIbQ4HhMeUtevBdILJFVwmzTlyg0qb_gyHIEkGNafrFe&amp;sig=AHIEtbR7Mj82NN49h2lDdIZw1xpNKi4DWA|title=Criminal Status of State Drunk Driving Laws|publisher=[[National Conference of State Legislatures]]|accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The amount of alcohol intake to reach a BAC of 0.08% may vary with the individual's body composition and state of health.  Prior to increased emphasis on drinking and driving in the 1980s, standards of 0.10%-0.15% were in place.

====New Jersey====
[[New Jersey]] has a general 0.08% BAC limit, but people can be convicted of drunk driving even when the BAC is under that limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=North Brunswick cops will be on the lookout for drunk drivers |url=http://www.nj.com/middlesex/index.ssf/2014/07/north_brunswick_dwi_enforcement.html |quote=Drivers in New Jersey are guilty of driving while intoxicated if their blood alcohol content is 0.08 percent or more, but people can also be convicted of drunk while under the influence of alcohol even when the BAC is under that limit, the township said. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 17, 2014  |accessdate=2013-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bicycle DUI===
Approximately 20-30 states criminalized impaired riding a bicycle, whereas others have no sanctions relevant to cycling.&lt;ref name="bikeleague"&gt;[http://bikeleague.org/sites/default/files/bui_full_chart.pdf ''Bicycling under the influence'' chart], League of American Bicyclists ('''.pdf''')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Avvobike"&gt;[https://www.avvo.com/legal-guides/ugc/a-state-by-state-guide-to-biking-under-the-influence A state-by-state guide to biking under the influence], Avvo&lt;/ref&gt;  Most such laws extend driving laws to all vehicles ("all vehicles" as opposed to "motor vehicles"), but a few address impaired bike riding separately.  In some states, enhanced penalties are automobile-specific.  Some states, notably Oregon, do not extend the [[implied consent|implied consent law]] to cyclists.&lt;ref name="bikeleague" /&gt;  While police activities targeting impaired cyclists are rare, a cyclist could encounter police in a circumstance where the cyclist would otherwise be ticketed.
{{refn|group=nb|It should be noted that cycling while impaired significantly increases the risk of injury and fatal accidents.

===Physician reporting===
Six states require physicians to report patients who drive while impaired.&lt;ref name=pmid19554818&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Jacob M. Appel]] |title=Must physicians report impaired driving? Rethinking a duty on a collision course with itself |journal=The Journal of Clinical Ethics |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=136–40 |year=2009 |pmid=19554818}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 25 states permit physicians to violate [[doctor-patient confidentiality]] to report impaired drivers, if they so choose.&lt;ref name=pmid19554818/&gt; The [[American Medical Association]] endorsed physician reporting in 1999, but deferred to the states on whether such notification should be mandatory or permissive.&lt;ref name=pmid19554818/&gt; [[Bioethics|Medical bioethicist]] [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]] of [[New York University]] says physician reporting may deter some patients from seeking care, writing "Reporting may remove some dangerous drivers from the roads, but if in doing so it actually creates other dangerous drivers, by scaring them away from treatment, then society has sacrificed confidentiality for no tangible return in lives saved."&lt;ref name=pmid19554818/&gt;

==Penalties==
The consequences of an impaired driving charge include both criminal and administrative penalties. Criminal penalties are imposed as a result of criminal prosecution. Administrative penalties are imposed by a state agency, and in some cases may apply even if a person stopped for impaired driving is not convicted of the offense.

===Criminal penalties===
The penalties for drunk driving vary among states and jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for the penalties to be different from county to county within any given state depending on the practices of the individual jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions require [[Prison|jail]] time and larger fines, even on a first offense. For instance, Ohio requires a mandatory 72-hour jail sentence for a first offense conviction; however, the jail time component is satisfied by attendance of the Ohio A.W.A.R.E. Program, which is a 72-hour alcohol-education program. Compared to many other countries, such as Sweden, penalties for drunk driving in the United States are considered less severe unless alcohol is involved in an incident causing injury or death of another, such DUI, DWI or OWI with Great Bodily Injury (GBI) or Vehicular Manslaughter.

====Diversion programs====
The State of Washington used to permit those charged with a first offense drunk driving to complete a diversion program that resulted in the charges being dismissed upon the completion of a Diversion Program. In 1975, under the revised code of Washington or RCW Section 10.05, the Washington State Legislature established a deferred prosecution option for offenders arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or impairing drugs (DUI). It was intended to encourage individuals to seek appropriate treatment and, under this option, defendants with a significant alcohol or drug dependence problem could petition a court to defer disposition of their charge until they have completed intensive substance dependence treatment and met other conditions required by the court. If the defendant successfully completed the terms of the program, the charge was dismissed; for those who failed, the deferred status was revoked and the defendant was prosecuted for the original DUI charge. (RCW 10.05.010 and 10.05.020) In 1992, the University of Washington Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute evaluated DUI deferred prosecution and concluded the program reduced DUI recidivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = Washington State Institute for Public Policy
| date =

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1998, the legislature modified the DUI statutes. Among other things, the length of deferred prosecution supervision was increased from two to five years and defendants were restricted to one deferred prosecution per lifetime.

====Driving While Impaired court====
{{main|DWI court}}
These innovative courts use substance abuse intervention with repeat offenders who plead guilty to driving while intoxicated. Those accepted into the diversionary program are required to abstain from alcohol. Some are required to wear a device that monitors and records any levels of alcohol detected in their bloodstreams.

===Administrative penalties===
The federal [[Assimilative Crimes Act]], which makes [[State law (United States)|state law]] applicable on lands reserved or acquired by the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] when the act or omission is not made punishable by an enactment of [[United States Congress|Congress]], recognizes collateral actions related to DUI convictions as punishments. According to {{UnitedStatesCode|18|13}}:

{{quote|… that which may or shall be imposed through judicial or administrative action under the law of a State, territory, possession, or district, for a conviction for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of a drug or alcohol, shall be considered to be a punishment provided by that law …}}

====SR-22 - Proof of Financial Responsibility====
An [[SR-22 (insurance)|SR-22]] is an addendum to an insurance policy. It is an administrative form that attests to an insurance company's coverage, or the posting of a personal public bond in the amount of the state's minimum liability coverage for the licensed driver or vehicle registration. The SR in SR-22 stands for Safety Responsibility, and it is needed to reinstate a suspended driver's license after a DUI conviction in 49 states and the District of Columbia. It is submitted to the State's DMV by an auto insurance company to serve as proof that a driver has the minimum liability insurance that the states requires. They are essentially an agreement between a driver's insurance company and the respective State's DMV that requires the driver's insurance company to notify the respective State's DMV that the driver's insurance has either been terminated or lapsed; thus instituting a suspension of the driver's driving privileges until proof of insurance is re-filed with the State's DMV.

While SR-22s are typically filed with the respective State's DMV, some States require the driver to carry proof of the SR-22 or to carry it in the registered vehicle, (particularly if the driver has been cited for coverage lapses or other administrative infractions). SR-22s may attest coverage for a vehicle regardless of operator (owner liability coverage), or cover a specific person regardless of the specific vehicle operated (operator liability coverage).

As stated, the form is required in 49 states and the US District of Columbia in order to register a vehicle for usage on public roads. It is also required to redeem a license which has been suspended due to coverage lapse in these required states. These states also, generally, require that the issuing insurance company provide the relevant state's DMV with timely updates as to the status of such coverage. If the policy with the SR22 cancels, a form called an SR26 is issued and sent to the state DMV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV/driverid/sr22.shtml Oregon DMV SR-22 Information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408113313/http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV/driverid/sr22.shtml |date=April 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon notice that there has been a lapse in coverage, the state will suspend the driver's license again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Delbridge|first1=Emily|title=What Happens If I Let My SR22 Car Insurance Cancel?|url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-happens-if-i-let-my-sr22-car-insurance-cancel-527270|website=The Balance|publisher=Dotdash|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another SR-22 filing will need to be submitted to regain driving privileges.

====Alcohol education programs====
Every jurisdiction imposes the completion of alcohol education programs, commonly known as DUI programs, subsequent to a DUI/DWI/OWI conviction. Additionally, some states impose an additional requirement that a person attend a Victim Impact Panel (VIP) administered by [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD), which was established in 1982. Both DUI classes and Victim Impact Panels are available in some states for first offense DUIs dependent on the judge's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victim Impact Panels|url=http://duijusticelink.aaa.com/issues/sanctions/victim-impact-panels/|website=AAA DUI Justice Link|publisher=AAA|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====DUI Plates====

In 1967, [[Ohio]] began to issue special [[vehicle registration plate|license plates]] to DUI offenders who are granted limited driving privileges such as work-related driving until a court can rule that they can have full privileges back. In 2004, the plates became mandated by state law to all DUI offenders.&lt;ref name=Party&gt;{{cite news |author=Bob Dyer |title=DUI plates are another Ohio flop |url=http://www.ohio.com/news/48584482.html |work=Akron Beacon Journal |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=2009-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Ohio's standard-issue plates (which as of 2008 have a picture of the Ohio country side), the DUI plates are yellow with red writing with no registration stickers or graphics. They are commonly referred to as "party plates".&lt;ref name=Party/&gt;

Minnesota has a similar program, where the plates are white with either blue or black text. The plate number is a "W", followed by a letter and four numbers. These plates may be issued to drivers with at least 2 offenses in a five-year period; three offenses in a ten-year period; having a BAC twice the legal limit; or having a child in the car at the time of arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bonnie|first1=Amistadi|title="Ask a Trooper" discusses Whiskey plates|url=http://kfgo.com/blogs/ask-a-trooper/944/ask-a-trooper-discusses-whiskey-plates/|accessdate=30 June 2017|agency=KFGO|date=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Minnesota, DUI plates are referred to as "whiskey plates",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Karen Youso |title=Fixit: 'Whiskey plates' indicate a DUI |url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/homegarden/11310931.html |work=Minneapolis Star Tribune |date=2007-03-23 |accessdate=2009-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129113805/http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/homegarden/11310931.html |archivedate=2009-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whiskey being the name of the letter W in the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]].

====Ignition interlock devices====
{{main|Ignition interlock device}}
Most states impose the installation of [[ignition interlock]] devices (IID), with varying thresholds for installation requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MADD Report: 2.3 Million Drunk Drivers Stopped by Interlocks |url=https://guardianinterlock.com/blog/new-madd-report-on-ignition-interlock-use/ |website=guardianinterlock.com |publisher=Guardian Interlock (20-Mar-2017)|ref=guardian_madd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Task Force Backs Ignition Interlocks as Drunk Driving Deterrent |url=https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2018/03/08/task-force-backs-ignition-interlocks-as-drunk-driving-deterrent/ |website=www.northcarolinahealthnews.org |publisher=North Carolina Health News |accessdate=24 June 2018 |ref=NC_interlocks_deterrent}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Criminal process thresholds for installation requirements vary between minimum BAC levels (e.g., 0.20%, or 0.15%) or repeat offense, with about half of the states requiring installation on first offense.

These [[ignition interlock]] sanctions are meant as punishment, but also as a deterrence.   When required under a high BAC level or multiple offense threshold, [[ignition interlock|ignition interlock requirements]] address a strong tendency of repeat offense by drivers with [[Alcoholism|alcoholic use disorder]] (AUD or alcoholism).

[[Ignition interlock]] requirements are also imposed in some instances after positive [[#chemical_test|chemical blood alcohol tests]], as a physical deterrent for drivers with [[Alcoholism|alcoholic use disorder]], or as a [[Civil penalty|pseudo-civil punishment]].  [[Ignition interlock]] requirements are also imposed in some instances after an [[implied consent|implied consent refusal]] under similar forensic procedures.

=====Operation of IIDs=====
In most US implementations, [[ignition interlock|IIDs]] are set to a "[[Zero tolerance#Driving|zero tolerance]]" level (set to either levels consistent with culinary alcohol or measurement errors).  Violations can occur from a driver exceeding the "[[Zero tolerance#Driving|zero tolerance]]" level, but can also occur from use by other drivers within legal limits, or from test anomalies.  In some states, anomalies are routinely discounted, for example as not consistent with patterns of BAC levels or at levels incompatible with life (e.g., significant mouth alcohol - which as BAC would be fatal).  In some states, "fail" readings not consistent with actual alcohol use can be cleared by a routine process, but other states automatically deem these "fail" readings as violations.

In operation, the driver blows into the [[ignition interlock|IIDs]] to enable the car's starter.  After a variable time period of approximately 20–40 minutes, the driver is required to re-certify (blow again) within a time period consistent with safely pulling off the roadway.  If the driver fails to re-certify within the time period, the car will alarm in a manner similar to setting off the car's immobilzer (but mechanically independent of the [[immobilizer]]).

Various US states have different penalties for disabling IIDs.  In some cases, the driver may be penalized if a family member or mechanic disables the IID when not in use by the sanctioned individual, or temporarily for servicing the vehicle.  In some implementations, disabling by mechanics and others is either permitted or authorisation easily obtained, but some jurisdictions restrict or deny authorisation.  (Such restrictions on mechanics can be problematic, for example, if limited to designated "licensed mechanics" or as applied to routine repair procedures requiring operation of the ignition and starter systems.)   Some jurisdictions criminalize such temporary bypass of IIDs.

=====Universal IID installation=====
Proposals (none official) have been made to install [[ignition interlock|IIDs]] on all new vehicles, set to the legal limit for the driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What If Every Car Had An Ignition Interlock? |url=https://guardianinterlock.com/blog/every-car-ignition-interlock/ |website=guardianinterlock.com |publisher=Guardian Interlock (31-Mar-2015)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Issues to be solved, besides consumer and voter acceptance, include difficulty in obtaining accurate measurements without inconvenience, and a need to achieve [[Six Sigma|Six&amp;nbsp;Sigma (6σ)]] reliability,&lt;ref&gt;6σ refers to long-term defect levels below 3.4 [[defects per million opportunities]] (DPMO)&lt;/ref&gt; in order to not interfere with vehicle usability.

There are no present plans to introduce universal IID installation in the US.

====Vehicle impoundment and forfeiture====
Some states, such as California, allow for the [[Vehicle impoundment|impoundment]] and [[asset forfeiture|forfeiture]] of vehicles under certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;California Vehicle Code §§ 14600 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;California Vehicle Code §§ 23592 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation and arrest==
A drunk driving charge is a type of police arrest process, so a basic understanding of the process of police engagement is essential to understanding how that process applies to that process as applied to a drunk driving charge.

===Legal Stages===
Following are common procedures when a law enforcement officer has reason to suspect a driver is intoxicated.  While local procedures vary under the 10s of thousands of courts in the US having traffic jurisdiction, the basic procedure is:
:'''1. reasonable suspicion'''
:'''2. probable cause'''
:'''3. arrest''' (including invoking the [[Implied consent#Driving while intoxicated|implied consent]] law)
:'''4. criminal charge and [[Civil penalty|"civil law" sanctions]]'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Civil penalty|Civil penalties]] in this context are in most instances criminal in nature, but intentionally circumvent criminal due process under the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal stages are relevant because of the degree of evidence required at each stage.   (For example, the police need not demonstrate guilt "beyond a reasonable doubt" in order to execute a traffic stop.)

===Investigation "Phases" (NHTSA)===
&lt;!-- POSSIBLY WILL CHANGE TO "INVESTIGATION PHASES" --&gt; 
The investigation and NHTSA "phases" are distinct from the legal stages of the police arrest process.  Instead, the investigation has, as its purpose, to take the process from initial contact through all of the evidence stages, through to prosecution.  The primary goals are to:
:- identify impaired drivers;
:- establish clear ''[[probable cause]] for arrest'', which is necessary to sustain the use of [[breathalyzer|chemical test results]] in court.  Without ''probable cause'', the [[breathalyzer|chemical test results]] are subject to the [[exclusionary rule]];
:- proceed to obtain proof of intoxication, typically using [[breathalyzer|chemical test results]].

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, police officers should conduct DUI Investigations according to a specific protocol called phases. According to the NHTSA training, DUI Investigations are categorized by these phases:
* Phase 1 - "Vehicle in Motion"
* Phase 2 - "Personal Contact"
* Phase 3 - "Pre-Arrest Screening"
The "Vehicle in Motion" Phase deals with the law enforcement officers observations of the suspect's driving maneuvers. The "Personal Contact" Phase is where the officer actually comes into contact with the DUI suspect. The "Pre-Arrest Screening" Phase is portion of the DUI Investigation that encompasses the Pre-Field Sobriety Test Questioning and the Field Sobriety Testing, including a Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test where applicable. This Phase also includes the post-arrest evidentiary chemical test despite that it occurs subsequent to a DUI arrest, not prior to a DUI arrest.

The officer will typically approach the driver's window and ask some preliminary questions. During this phase of the stop the officer will note if they detect any of the following indicators of intoxication:
*Odor of an alcoholic beverage on the driver's breath or in the car generally
*Slurred speech in response to the questioning
*Watery, blood shot, or reddish eyes
*Flushed face
*Droopy eyelids
*Difficulty in understanding and responding intelligently to question
*Fumbling with his or her driver's license and registration
*The plain-view presence of containers of alcoholic beverages in the vehicle
*Admission of consumption of alcoholic beverage

If the officer observes enough to have a reasonable suspicion to legally justify a further detention and investigation, they will ask the driver to step out of the vehicle, and request that the driver submit to voluntary [[Field sobriety testing|field sobriety tests]].

===Overall Stop and Arrest Process===
''Note:  Local terminology will vary, but these general classifications fall under [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] guidelines.''

Each stage has different requirements for establishing a basis for police or prosecutorial  action.   Without establishing that basis, the process is illegal and can cause a prosecution to fail under the [[exclusionary rule]].

====1. Reasonable suspicion and traffic stop====
{{main|Reasonable suspicion}}
The police must have a reason to engage in a traffic stop.  This typically involves either observing a traffic violation or observing behavior, such as weaving or lane departure, that would raise a "reasonable suspicion" of driving while impaired.  The police must have an articulable reason for the stop, but does not need probable cause for an arrest.

One exception is a roadblock (where legal).  Roadblocks do not involve reasonable suspicion but must meet particular legal standards to avoid arbitrariness but still assure randomness.

During the traffic stop, the police will attempt to obtain sufficient evidence to support "probable cause".  This includes asking questions, and requesting further evidence or confession.

There are several situations in which the officer will come into contact with a driver, some examples are:
*The officer on patrol has observed erratic, suspicious driving, or a series of traffic infractions indicating the possibility that the driver may be impaired. This is by far the most common reason for stopping a suspect.
*A police officer has stopped a vehicle for a lesser traffic offense, notices the signs of intoxication, and begins the DUI investigation.
*The driver has been involved in an automobile accident; the officer has responded to the scene and is conducting an investigation.
*The driver has been stopped at a [[random checkpoint|sobriety checkpoint]] (also known as roadblocks).
*The police have received a report, possibly from an anonymous citizen, that a described car has been driving erratically. The officer should verify the erratic driving before pulling the driver over. In some cases, the driver will no longer be in the vehicle.

The following list of DUI symptoms, from a publication issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (DOT HS-805-711),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guide for detecting drunk drivers at night|date=1985|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is widely used in training officers to detect drunk drivers. After each symptom is a percentage figure which, according to NHTSA, indicates the statistical chances through research that a driver is over the legal limit.

| Turning with wide radius                      || over 50%

|}

If the officer observes enough evidence to have a "[[Reasonable suspicion|Reasonable Suspicion]]" to legally justify a further detention and investigation, they will ask the driver to step out of the vehicle.

====2. Probable cause====
"Probable cause" is established by obtaining evidence from the police encounter sufficient to meet the "probable cause" standard for arrest.   "Probable cause" is not necessarily sufficient to obtain a conviction, but is a prerequisite for arrest.  Examples of "probable cause" for a drunk driving arrest includes:

:1. Observation
:2. [[Confession (law)|Confession]] of having consumed alcohol in the recent past.  '''Relevant examples of confessions:'''
:::- "I had a glass of wine."
:::- "I was at a friend's party."
:::- "I was at the Stone Balloon."
::The confession is the easiest way to establish "probable cause", and police know that social convention encourages people to respond to police questions.  ''While it is inadvisable to lie to police, the suspect has the option to "respectfully decline" to answer questions.''&lt;ref name="riskology"&gt;[https://www.riskology.co/traffic-stop/ Pulled Over? Here’s the Right Way to Handle a Traffic Stop], ''Riskology''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="findlaw_stop"&gt;[https://blogs.findlaw.com/blotter/2013/07/civil-rights-during-a-traffic-stop-5-reminders.html Civil Rights During a Traffic Stop: 5&amp;nbsp;Reminders], findlaw.com&lt;/ref&gt;
::The suspect is typically not given [[Miranda warnings]] at this time because the encounter legally has not gone from "investigatory" to "accusatory", and because the police want the suspect to believe the questions are not being made to gather "probable cause" evidence.   At this point, the suspect is not required to provide more than identification and vehicle information.
:3. Documented test results, such as
::- Preliminary breath test evidence
::- Pseudo-scientific test results from [[field sobriety testing|field sobriety tests]]

====Field sobriety tests====
{{main|Field sobriety testing}}
[[File:Fieldsobrietytest usa ct.jpg|right|thumb|Police administer a one-leg-stand test after a crash.]]
&lt;!-- NOTE:  THESE DETAILS ARE BEING MOVED TO THE "FIELD SOBRIETY TESTING" SECTION --&gt;

One of the most controversial aspects of a DUI stop is the [[field sobriety test]] (FSTs). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has developed a model system for managing Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) training.

=====Issues with FSTs=====
They have published numerous training manuals associated with FSTs. As a result of the NHTSA studies, the walk-and-turn test was determined to be 68% accurate, and the one-leg stand test is only 65% accurate when administered to people within the study parameters. The tests were not validated for people with medical conditions, injuries, 65 years or older, and 50 pounds or greater overweight. The officer will administer one or more field sobriety tests. FSTs are considered "divided attention tests" that test the suspect's ability to perform the type of mental and physical multitasking that is required to operate an automobile. However, these tests can be problematic for people with non-obvious disabilities affecting proprioception, such as [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]].

The three validated tests by NHTSA are:
#The Horizontal Gaze [[Physiologic nystagmus|Nystagmus]] Test, which involves following an object with the eyes (such as a pen) to determine characteristic eye movement reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus: The Science and the Law|url=https://ntl.bts.gov/lib/25000/25900/25975/DOT-HS-808-938.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=American Prosecutors Research Institute|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The Walk-and-Turn Test ([[Tandem gait|heel-to-toe]] in a straight line). This test is designed to measure a person's ability to follow directions and remember a series of steps while dividing attention between physical and mental tasks.
#The One-Leg-Stand Test

According to NHTSA, these tests were not designed to measure impairment, but rather to give a probability that a driver is at or above a 0.08% BAC. However, studies have shown that there are reasons to doubt the tests' usefulness in helping an officer to make such a determination. In 1991, Dr. Spurgeon Cole of Clemson University conducted a study of the accuracy of FSTs. His staff videotaped people performing six common field sobriety tests, then showed the tapes to 14 police officers and asked them to decide whether the suspects had "had too much to drink and drive" (''sic''). The blood-alcohol concentration of each of the 21 DUI subjects was 0.00, unknown to the officers. The result: the officers gave their opinion that 46% of these innocent people were too drunk to be able to drive. This study showed the possible inaccuracy of FSTs.&lt;ref&gt;Cole and Nowaczyk, "Field Sobriety Tests: Are they Designed for Failure?", 79 Perceptual and Motor Skills Journal 99 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative tests, which have not been scientifically validated, include:
*[[Romberg test]], or the Modified-Position-of-Attention Test, (feet together, head back, eyes closed for thirty seconds).
*The Finger-to-Nose Test (tip head back, eyes closed, touch the tip of nose with tip of index finger).
*The Alphabet Test (recite all or part of the alphabet).
*The Finger Count Test (touch each finger of hand to thumb counting with each touch (1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1)).
*The Counting Test (counting backwards from a number ending in a number other than 5 or 0 and stopping at a number ending other than 5 or 0. The series of numbers should be more than 15).
*The Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test, PAS Test or PBT, (breathe into a "portable or preliminary breath tester", PAS Test or PBT).

=====Purpose=====
FSTs and SFSTs are promoted as, "used to determine whether a subject is impaired",&lt;ref name="NHTSA_refresher"&gt;[https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/sfst_ig_refresher_manual.pdf Instructor Guide - DWI Detection and SFST Refresher], NHTSA (rev. 10/2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;[https://duijusticelink.aaa.com/issues/detection/standard-field-sobriety-test-sfst-and-admissibility/ Standardized Field Sobriety Test], AAA (US) "DUI Justice Link"&lt;/ref&gt; but FST tests are widely regarded having, as their primary purpose, establishing tangible evidence of "[[probable cause|probable cause for arrest]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cga.ct.gov/2000/rpt/2000-R-0873.htm Connecticut OLR report, ''The use of field sobriety tests in drunk driving enforcement''], 2000-R-0873 (9-Nov-2000); ''see "Phase III—Pre-arrest Screening and Administration of Field Sobriety Tests"''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="findlawFST"&gt;[https://dui.findlaw.com/dui-arrests/field-sobriety-tests.html Field Sobriety Tests], findlaw.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idahoman"&gt;''accord, p. 29'' [http://www.nlelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SFST_Handout.pdf Field Sobriety Tests Review], Idaho Prosecuting Attorneys Association (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaa" /&gt;  [[Probable cause]] is necessary under US law ([[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th Amendment]]) to sustain an arrest and (significantly) to invoke the [[Implied consent|implied consent law]].

A secondary purpose is to provide supporting corroborative tangible evidence for use against the suspect for use at trial in jurisdictions that permit such evidence.&lt;ref name="HGN_APRI"&gt;[https://www.ndaa.org/pdf/admissibility%20of%20hgn_april_2003.pdf Admissibility of Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Evidence], American Prosecutors Research Institute (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Field Sobriety Test Refusals =====
&lt;!-- NOTE:  FST refusals also in "Field sobriety testing" section.  This could be made a "transclusion" ("Labeled section transclusion"?), since it is directly relevant here.  i.e., someone who only wants to read about the DUI process would want to know about FST refusals without being interested with FSTs *per se*. --&gt;

{{further|Field sobriety testing#Field sobriety test refusals}}
In all US jurisdictions, participation in a [[Field sobriety testing|Field Sobriety Test]] is voluntary, and not required under [[implied consent]] laws.&lt;ref name="nolo_ref-long" /&gt;  (Police are not obliged to advise the suspect that participation in a FST or other pre-arrest procedures is voluntary.  In contrast, formal evidentiary tests given under [[Implied consent#Driving while intoxicated|implied consent]] requirements are considered mandatory.)&lt;ref name="nolo_ref" /&gt;

A suspect requested to participate in a [[Field sobriety testing|Field Sobriety Test]] is likely to be told that the purpose is to determine whether the suspect is impaired;&lt;ref name="NHTSA_refresher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aaa"/&gt; however, FST tests are widely regarded having, as their primary purpose, gaining tangible evidence for use against the suspect in the establishment of [[probable cause|probable cause for arrest]].&lt;ref name="findlawFST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="idahoman"/&gt;

====Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) or Preliminary Alcohol Screening test (PAS)====
An increasingly used field sobriety test involves having the suspect breathe into a small, handheld breath testing device. These are often referred to as PAS Tests, or "Preliminary Alcohol Screening" Tests", or a PBT, "Preliminary Breath Test" and precede the actual arrest and subsequent requirement to submit to an evidentiary chemical test of the suspect's breath or blood. These breath testing devices used are smaller, inexpensive versions of the larger, more sophisticated instruments at the police stations, commonly known as an Evidentiary Breath Test using an EBT device, or Evidentiary Breath Test device. An increasing number jurisdictions began using Portable Evidentiary Breath Test devices, or PEBT devices, that are more sophisticated versions of the smaller, inexpensive versions of the larger, larger instruments at the police stations. Another distinction is that, while the larger EBTs usually employ [[infrared spectroscopy]], the PEBT and PAS devices use a relatively simple electrochemical ([[fuel cell]]) technology. When used for purposes of a Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test, or PAS Test, their purpose, along with the other FSTs, is to assist the officer in determining whether he/she has [[probable cause]] for arrest.

The Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) or Preliminary Alcohol Screening test (PAS) is sometimes categorised as part of ''field sobriety testing'', although it is not part of the series of performance tests.  The PBT (or PAS) uses a portable breath tester.   While the tester provides numerical blood alcohol content (BAC) readings, its primary use is for screening and establishing [[probable cause|probable cause for arrest]], to invoke the [[Implied consent#Driving while intoxicated|implied consent]] requirements.  In US law, this is necessary to sustain a conviction based on evidential testing (or implied consent refusal).&lt;ref name="nolo_ref"&gt;[https://dui.drivinglaws.org/resources/dui-refusal-blood-breath-urine-test.htm DUI: Refusal to Take a Field Test, or Blood, Breath or Urine Test], NOLO Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless of the terminology, in order to sustain a conviction based on evidential tests, ''probable cause'' must be shown (or the suspect must volunteer to take the evidential test without [[Implied consent#Driving while intoxicated|implied consent]] requirements being invoked).&lt;ref name="nolo_ref" /&gt;

Police are not obliged to advise the suspect that participation in a FST or other pre-arrest procedures is voluntary.  In contrast, formal evidentiary tests given under [[Implied consent#Driving while intoxicated|implied consent]] requirements are considered mandatory.&lt;ref name="nolo_ref" /&gt;

Refusal to take a preliminary breath test (PBT) in Michigan subjects a non-commercial driver to a "civil infraction" penalty, with no violation "points",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1627_8665-24488--,00.html|title=SOS - Substance Abuse and Driving|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is not considered to be a refusal under the general "implied consent" law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/813.136|title=ORS 813.136 (2015) - Consequence of refusal or failure to submit to field sobriety tests|first=Oregon Legislative Counsel|last=Committee|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some states, the state may present evidence of refusal to take a field sobriety test in court, although this is of questionable probative value in a drunk driving prosecution.

Different requirements apply in many states to drivers under DUI probation, in which case participation in a preliminary breath test (PBT) may be a condition of probation, and for commercial drivers under "drug screening" requirements.  Some US states, notably California, have statutes on the books penalizing PBT refusal for drivers under 21; however the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Constitutionality]] of those statutes has not been tested.  (As a practical matter, most criminal lawyers advise not engaging in discussion or "justifying" a refusal with the police.)

====3. Arrest (including invoking the [[Implied consent#Driving while intoxicated|implied consent]] law)====

=====Probable cause for arrest=====
{{main|Probable cause}}
If the officer has sufficient probable cause that the suspect has been driving under the influence of alcohol, they will make the arrest, [[handcuff]] the suspect and transport them to the police station. En route, the officer may advise them of their legal [[implied consent]] obligation to submit to an evidentiary chemical test of blood, breath or possibly urine depending on the jurisdiction.

Laws relating to what exactly constitutes probable cause vary from state to state. In California it is a refutable presumption that a person with a BAC of 0.08% or higher is driving under the influence. However, section 23610(a)(2) of the [[California Vehicle Code]] states that driving with a BAC between 0.05% and 0.08% "shall not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of an alcoholic beverage".

====Chemical test====
An arrestee will be offered a [[Chemistry|chemical]] test of breath, blood or, much less frequently, urine. Breath test results are usually available immediately; urine and blood samples are sent to a [[Laboratory|lab]] for later analysis to determine the BAC or possible presence of drugs. Some states sought to impose criminal punishment for a refusal to submit to a chemical test of his/her breath or blood; however, in ''[[Birchfield v. North Dakota]]'', the [[United States Supreme Court]] visited the issue of whether states can criminalize a refusal to submit to a chemical test. The United States Supreme Court decided that states may criminalize a refusal to submit to a breath test; but not a refusal to submit to a blood test absent a McNeely warrant, named after ''[[Missouri v. McNeely]]'' (2013), which was a case decided by United States Supreme Court, on appeal from the Supreme Court of Missouri, regarding exceptions to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution under exigent circumstances.[1] The United States Supreme Court ruled that police must generally obtain a warrant before subjecting a drunken-driving suspect to a blood test, and that the natural metabolism of blood alcohol does not establish a per se exigency that would justify a blood draw without consent.

Regarding blood tests, some commentators, such as Brown University's Jacob Appel, have criticized the role of medical personnel in this process. According to Appel, "If physicians acquiesce today in the removal of a resistant patient's blood, soon they may be called upon to pump the contents of an unwilling patient's stomach or even to perform involuntary surgery to retrieve an evidential bullet".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob M. Appel]]. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB108120605066174867 A Tragic Injustice to the Hippocratic Oath?], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', April 6, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

While chemical tests are used to determine the driver's BAC, they do not determine the driver's level of impairment. However, state laws usually provide for a rebuttable legal presumption of intoxication at a BAC of 0.08% or higher (see [[blood alcohol test assumptions]]).

====4. Criminal charge, and "civil law" sanctions====

=====Booking and charging=====
{{further|Arrest#United States}}

If it is determined after arrest that the person's BAC is not at or above the legal limit of 0.08%, they will probably be released without any charges. One may, however, still be charged with driving under the influence of alcohol on the basis of driving symptoms, observed impairment, admissions or performance on the field sobriety tests. And if there is suspicion of drug usage, a blood or urine test is likely, or at least the testimony of a specially trained officer called a [[Drug Recognition Expert]] (DRE). Assuming sufficient evidence of impaired driving from drugs, the arrested may face charges of driving under the influence of drugs or the combined influence of alcohol and drugs.

Most of the time, the driver will either be kept in a holding cell (sometimes referred to as the "[[drunk tank]]") until they are deemed sober enough to be released on [[bail]] or on his "own [[recognizance]]" (OR). A date to appear in court for an [[arraignment]] will be given to them. If they cannot make bail or is not granted OR, they will be kept in jail to wait for the arraignment on [[remand (detention)|remand]].

==Cost of an impaired driving charge==
In the United States, paying the DUI ticket, court costs, and attorney fees is just the start of a person's financial obligations after a DUI conviction. Additional costs of a DUI conviction will often involve the installation and maintenance fees of a vehicle Ignition Interlock Device, which serves the same function as a Breathalyzer to enable the vehicle to start. A person convicted of a driving under the influence charge, can also expect to pay higher insurance rates and premiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Decotis|first1=Mark|title=The Real Cost of a DUI|url=http://spacecoast.floridaweekly.com/news/2012-05-17/Top_News/THE_REAL_COST_of_a_DUI.html|accessdate=4 December 2017|agency=Florida Weekly|publisher=Florida Media Group LLC|date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost of a DUI|url=http://www2.courtinfo.ca.gov/stopteendui/parents/cost/how-much-does-a-dui-cost.cfm|website=California Judicial Council|publisher=State of California|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DUI: The $10,000 Toast|url=https://dbhdd.georgia.gov/press-releases/2009-12-29/dui-10000-toast|website=Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities|publisher=State of Georgia|accessdate=4 December 2017|date=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, DUI records prevent entry into Canada without proper documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the new policy on criminal inadmissibility?|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=143&amp;top=8|website=Immigration and Citizenship|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flying and boating under the influence==
Federal Aviation Regulation 91.17 ({{CodeFedReg|14|91|17}}) prohibits pilots from flying aircraft with an alcohol level of 0.04% or more, or within eight hours of consuming alcohol (''"eight hours, bottle to throttle"''), or while under the impairing influence of any drug. The same prohibition applies to any other crew members on duty aboard the aircraft (flight attendants, etc.). Some airlines impose additional restrictions, and many pilots also impose stricter standards upon themselves. Commercial pilots found to be in violation of regulations are typically fired or resign voluntarily, and they may lose their pilot certificates and be subject to criminal prosecution under Federal or State laws, effectively ending their careers.

Similar laws apply to other activities involving transportation; [[Michigan]] prohibits intoxicated bicycling, horseback riding, buggy driving, use of motorized farm implements, or boating, the latter whether a pilot or passenger, with much the same threshold of intoxication. In the case of boating, the laws extend to include kayaks, canoes, sailboats—any flotation device that needs to be steered in water. Different states have different laws and classifications on the level of transgression attached to a citation for boating under the influence. For example, [[Virginia]] has very similar penalties for a BUI as it does for a DUI. Those convicted of boating while intoxicated face penalties including, fines of up to $2,500, jail time of up to one year, loss of your operator's license for up to three years and mandatory enrollment and completion of a Virginia Alcohol Safety Action Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penalties for Boating While Intoxicated|url=https://www.boat-ed.com/virginia/studyGuide/Penalties-for-Boating-While-Intoxicated/10104701_700061987/|website=Boat Virginia Course|publisher=Kalkomey Enterprises, LLC.|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcohol use was the number one contributing factor in U.S. recreational boating deaths between 2003 and 2012, accounting for 15 percent of the fatalities in 2003, and 17 percent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accident Statistics |publisher=U.S. Coast Guard |url=http://www.uscgboating.org/statistics/accident_statistics.aspx |accessdate=Sep 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814121613/http://www.uscgboating.org/statistics/accident_statistics.aspx |archivedate=2013-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Canadian study published in 2011 examined 18 years of data on recreational boating, and concluded that a "true figure" of alcohol-related deaths in that country "may lie between 46% and 56%".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Barss | first = Peter | title = Boating Immersion and Trauma Deaths in Canada: 18 Years of Research | publisher = Transport Canada and The Canadian Red Cross Society | year = 2011 | url = http://www.redcross.ca/cmslib/general/2011_boating_fnl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}

==International comparisons==
{{see also|Driving under the influence}}

In countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia drunk driving and deaths caused by drunk driving are considerably lower than in the USA. Drunk driving deaths in the UK (population 61 million, 31 million cars) were 380 in 2010 (21% of all fatal accidents).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/annual-road-fatalities|title=Annual road fatalities|author=|date=|website=GOV.UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/837234-uk-drink-driving-related-deaths-at-all-time-low|title=UK drink driving related deaths at all time low|publisher=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/7563297/Number-of-cars-declines-for-the-first-time-since-Second-World-War.html|title=Number of cars declines for the first time since Second World War|author=David Millward|publisher=Telegraph|location=London|date=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[California]] (population 36 million, 32 million cars) there were 950 deaths from traffic accidents involving drivers with a Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) of 0.08 or greater) in 2009 (31% of all fatal accidents).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ots.ca.gov/OTS_and_Traffic_Safety/Report_Card_2011.asp|title=California Office of Traffic Safety (OTS)|first=California Office of Traffic Safety|last=(OTS)|date=|website=www.ots.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/print_release.php?id=1512 |title=News &amp; Alerts - California Dept. of Justice - Office of the Attorney General |publisher=Ag.ca.gov |date=2007-12-19 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol consumption per capita in the UK and Australia is higher than in the USA and the [[legal drinking age|legal age for drinking]] lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1357892/U-S-drinks-lowest-alcohol-developed-world-figures-reveal.html |title=Publications - DailyMail.CO |publisher=DailyMail.CO |accessdate=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in the United Kingdom has shown that the danger group for drunk driving is young men in their early 20s rather than teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/archive/1998/comdd/combatingdrinkdrivingnextsteps |title=Publications - GOV.UK |publisher=Dft.gov.uk |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not uncommon for police forces in Australia to randomly stop motorists and submit them to a [[random breath test]]. This test involves speaking or blowing into a hand held device to give a reading. Refusing a roadside test is an offense, and is subject to the same penalty as high range drunk driving. This detection method is not employed in the UK, and it is not an offence in England or Wales for a fully licensed driver to drive with a BAC of less than 0.08% (Australia and Scotland have limits of 0.05%). Also in Australia it is an offence for any person driving on Learner or probationary ('P1 or P2') plates (aged under 20 years) to drive with any alcohol at all in their system. The BAC must be 0.00% and still remains under 0.05% for an "instructing a learner".

Unlike the USA, these countries do not see restricting access to alcohol as having any useful role to play in reducing drunk driving. Their experience is that random breath tests, severe penalties, including imprisonment for a first offense (in UK), combined with blanket public service broadcasting are a more effective strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0847/is_n1_v14/ai_9356459/?tag=content;col1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708002242/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0847/is_n1_v14/ai_9356459/?tag=content;col1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-08 |work=Alcohol Health &amp; Research World |title=Random breath testing the Australian way: a model for the United States? |first=Ross J. |last=Homel |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, Australian and British law do not recognize the crime of DUI manslaughter, and sentences for causing death by drunk driving are much lower than the USA. In the UK, a judge makes a sentencing decision based on the amount of alcohol present. This can lead to imprisonment for a first offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drinkdrivinglaw.co.uk/drink_driving_penalties_punishments.htm |title=Drink Driving Penalties and Maximum Punishments |publisher=Drinkdrivinglaw.co.uk |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/4738709.stm | work=BBC News | title=Drink-driving dinner lady jailed | date=2005-08-02 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, a legal limit of 0.05% lowers to 0.03% if a driver is found to be at fault in a traffic accident. 0.00% is the standard for those who are under 21 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safetravel.co.uk/EuropeDrinkDrivingLimits.html |title=Drink Driving Limits in Europe |publisher=Safetravel.co.uk |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A long series of events triggered the '''[[Sino-Indian War]]''' in 1962. According to John W.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; were important in [[China]]'s decision to fight a war with [[India]].

==Friendly relations==
Numerous changes occurred in the late 1940s, with the independence of the [[Republic of India]] and the [[Islamic Republic of Pakistan]] in 1947, and the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in 1949. One of the most basic policies for the [[Indian government]] was that of maintaining cordial relations with China.&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt; The Indian government wished to revive its ancient friendly ties with China.&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt; When the PRC was declared, India was among the first countries to give it diplomatic recognition.&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt;

After coming to power, the PRC announced that its army would be occupying Tibet.  India sent a letter of protest to China proposing negotiations on the Tibet issue.&lt;ref name="Guruswamy"&gt;Mohan Guruswamy, Mohan, [http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/jun/20spec.htm "The Great India-China Game"], Rediff, 23 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The newly formed PRC was more active in posting troops to the [[Aksai Chin]] border than the newly formed Indian republic was. India decided to take moves to ensure a stable Indo-Chinese border.&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt; In August 1950, China expressed its gratitude to India's attempts to "stabilize the Indo-Chinese border".&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt; To clear any doubts or ambiguities, [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] stated in [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] in 1950 that "Our maps show that the [[McMahon Line]] is our boundary and that is our boundary...we stand by that boundary and we will not let anyone else come across that boundary". China expressed no concerns at these statements.&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt;

By 1951, China had extended numerous posts in Aksai Chin.&lt;ref name="Guruswamy"/&gt; The Indian government, on the other hand, concentrated its military efforts on stopping [[Ladakh]] from being taken by [[Pakistan|Pakistani troops]] and did not establish itself in Aksai Chin.&lt;ref name="VKSingh"&gt;[http://www.india-seminar.com/2006/562/562-vk-singh.htm VK Singh] resolving the boundary dispute&lt;/ref&gt; On various occasions in 1951 and 1952, however, the government of China expressed the idea that there were no frontier issues between India and Chinese Tibet to be worried about.&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt;

Later, in September 1951, India declined to attend a conference in San Francisco for the conclusion of a peace treaty with [[Japan]] because China, which India viewed as an important factor in this treaty, was not invited because of its status as an international pariah.&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt; In the coming years India strove to become China's representative in world matters, as China had been isolated from many issues. India vigorously pressed, since the start of the 1950s, for the PRC to be included within the UN.&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt;

The [[People's Liberation Army]] defeated the Tibetan army in a battle at [[Chamdo]] in 1950 and [[Lhasa]] recognized Chinese sovereignty over Tibet in 1951. The Indian army asserted control of Tawang at this time, overcoming some armed resistance and expelling its Tibetan administrators.&lt;ref name="Neville Maxwell"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maxwell |first=Neville |title=Settlements and Disputes: China's Approach to Territorial Issues |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=41 |issue=36 |pages=3876 |date=9 September 2006 |url=http://www.epw.org.in/articles/2006/09/10532.pdf |accessdate=2006-09-29 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001145204/http://www.epw.org.in/articles/2006/09/10532.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, China and India concluded the [[Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence]] under which India acknowledged Chinese sovereignty in Tibet. Indian negotiators presented a frontier map to the Chinese that included the McMahon Line and the Chinese side did not object. At this time, the Indian government under Prime Minister Nehru promoted the slogan ''Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai'' (India and China are brothers).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

On 1 July 1954 Nehru wrote a memo directing that the maps of India be revised to show definite boundaries on all frontiers, where they were previously indicated as undemarcated.&lt;ref name="Noorani"&gt;A.G. Noorani, [http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2018/stories/20030912002104800.htm "Fact of History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013172913/http://hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2018/stories/20030912002104800.htm |date=13 October 2007 }}, ''India's National Magazine'', 30 September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The new maps also revised the boundary in the east to show the Himalayan hill crest as the boundary. In some places, this line is a few kilometres north of the McMahon Line.&lt;ref name="Noorani2"&gt;A.G. Noorani, [http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2017/stories/20030829001604900.htm "Perseverance in peace process"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050326174852/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2017/stories/20030829001604900.htm |date=26 March 2005 }}, ''India's National Magazine'', 29 August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; These new maps were also revised to show the countries of [[Bhutan]] and [[Sikkim]] as part of India.&lt;ref name="Neville Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;!--Footnotes not included in online version of Maxwell, but is on pg. 83 of paper copy--&gt;

Beginning in 1956, the CIA used Indian territory to recruit Tibetan guerrillas to fight Chinese troops, with a base in [[Kalimpong]], India.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Conboy and James Morrison, "The CIA's Secret War in Tibet", ''University Press of Kansas'', 2002, pp. 96-97&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian public was outraged when it learned in 1958 that China had built a road between Xinjiang and Tibet through Indian territory in Aksai Chin (historically a part of Indian state of Ladakh).

In 1956, Nehru expressed concern to Zhou Enlai that Chinese maps showed some 120,000 square kilometres of Indian territory as Chinese.&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt; Zhou responded that there were errors in the maps and that they were of little meaning.&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt; He stated that the maps needed revising from previous years where such ideas were considered to be true.&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt; In November 1956, Zhou again repeated his assurances that he had no claims based on the maps.&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt;

==Tibet disagreements==
According to John W. Garver, Nehru's policy on Tibet was to create a strong Sino-Indian partnership which would be catalyzed through agreement and compromise on Tibet.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt; Garver believes that Nehru's previous actions (befriending China on such issues as war in Korea, the PRC's U.N. admission, the peace treaty with Japan and transfer of Taiwan to the PRC, Indochina, and decolonization and the Afro-Asian movement) had given Nehru a confidence that China would be ready to form an "Asian Axis" with India.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt; Much misunderstanding between the two nations led to diplomatic spats over Tibet, with Nehru's move to accommodate the [[Dalai Lama]] overshadowing his other actions and opinions on Tibet, including the opinion that an armed resistance movement in Tibet would be suicidal and counterproductive.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt; While China treated India's concerns with Tibet as expansionist, Some in India claim that its concerns were in fact sentimental and culturally-linked, as [[Buddhism|Buddhist Tibet]] had been under influence of Indian culture for many years.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt;

Top PRC leader [[Mao Zedong]] was humiliated by the reception the [[Dalai Lama]] obtained in India when he fled there in March 1959.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt; The Tibet disagreements heightened in the Chinese media, with Mao himself asking [[Xinhua News Agency]] on 19 April to produce commentary on unknown Indian expansionists operating in Tibet.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt; Mao decided on 25 April to openly criticize Nehru for his Tibet policy:

{{quote|Be sharp, don't fear to irritate him [Nehru], don't fear to cause him trouble. Nehru miscalculated the situation believing that China could not suppress the rebellion in Tibet and would have to beg India's help.|[[Mao Zedong]] addressing a Politburo Standing Committee&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt;}}

Tensions steadily increased between the two nations when Mao implied that the Lhasa rebellion in Tibet was caused by Indians. On 6 May 1959, Mao published "The Revolution in Tibet and Nehru's Philosophy" where he accused Nehru of openly encouraging Tibetan rebels.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt; This publication was evident of China's perception of India as a threat to its rule of Tibet, which became an underlying reason for triggering the Sino-Indian War. India had become the imperialist enemy, with Nehru and his "big [[bourgeoisie]]" striving to "prevent China from exercising full sovereignty over its territory of Tibet" to form of a [[buffer zone]]. On the same day, [[Zhou Enlai]] lashed out at Nehru's "class nature".&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt;

{{quote|Nehru and people from the Indian upper class oppose reform in Tibet, even to the extent of saying that reform is impossible...[They want] Tibet to remain for a long time in a backward state, becoming a 'buffer state' between China and India. This is their guiding mentality, and also the center of the Sino-Indian conflict.|[[Zhou Enlai]]&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt;}}

India continued negotiations about Tibet. According to the Indian official history, India wished to express goodwill to China and stop the claims of it having a hostile design in Tibet.&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt;

In August 1959, the Chinese army took an Indian patrol prisoner at Longju, which falls north of the McMahon Line coordinates drawn on the [[Simla Accord (1914)|Simla Treaty]], signed in 1914, map (27°44'30''N), but claimed by India to lie directly on the McMahon Line.&lt;ref name="Guruswamy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Noorani2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Noorani3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt; There was another bloody clash in October at [[Kongka Pass]]&lt;ref name="Vivek"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Aksai Chin in which 9 Indian frontier policemen were killed.&lt;ref name="Guruswamy"/&gt; Recognizing that it was not ready for war, the Indian Army assumed responsibility for the border and pulled back patrols from disputed areas.

On 2 October, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] defended Nehru in a meeting with Mao. The Soviet Union's siding with Nehru, as well as the United States' influence in the region, gave China the belief that it was surrounded by enemy forces. On 16 October, General Lei Yingfu reported on Indian expansionism on the [[Thag La Ridge]]. On 18 October, the Chinese government approved the PLA's plan of a "self-defensive counterattack" against India because of its actions in Tibet.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt;

However, Mao decided against further escalation because he feared that India would retaliate by permitting the U.S. to station [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] surveillance aircraft on its territory.&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;Chang, Jung and Jon Halliday, ''Mao: The Unknown Story'' (2006), pp. 568, 579.&lt;/ref&gt; This would allow the CIA to photograph China's nuclear test site at [[Lop Nor]] in Xinjiang.&lt;ref name="Chang"/&gt; A few days after Kongka Pass, Chinese Prime Minister [[Zhou Enlai]] proposed that each side withdraw 20 kilometres from a "[[Line of Actual Control]]". He defined this line as "the so-called McMahon Line in the east and the line up to which each side exercises actual control in the west".&lt;ref name="Noorani"/&gt; Nehru responded with a proposal to turn the disputed area into a no man's land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894328-8,00.html "The Shade of the Big Banyan"] ''Time'', 14 Dec. 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese studies of the 1990s still maintain that India was planning aggression in Tibet.  Most Chinese scholars believe that the root cause of the war was India's plan to seize Tibet and turn it into a protectorate or colony of India.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt; The official Chinese history of the war states that Nehru was planning to create a "great Indian empire". It was also insisted that there were [[right wing]] nationalist forces that influenced Nehru to pursue the goal of controlling Tibet. Zhao Weiwen, of the Chinese Ministry of State and Security, places emphasis on Nehru's "dark mentality".&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt;

China's policy on Tibet did much to heighten the conflict and tensions between the two nations. The perceptions of India as a capitalist expansionist body intent on the independence of Tibet to create a buffer zone between India proper and China were fundamentally erroneous. The negative rhetoric led to what Zhou himself called the Sino-Indian conflict.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt; Because of these false fears, China treated the Indian Forward Policy of the 1960s, which India admits as a fundamental mistake,&lt;ref name="VKSingh"/&gt; as the beginning of Indian expansionism into Tibet.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt;

==Border negotiations==
China's 1958 maps showed the large strip of [[Northeastern part of Jammu and Kashmir]] (the Aksai Chin) as Chinese.&lt;ref name="VKSingh"/&gt; In 1960, Zhou Enlai proposed that India drop its claim to [[Aksai Chin]] and China would withdraw its claims from NEFA.  According to John W. Garver, Zhou's propositions were unofficial and subtle. Zhou consistently refused to accept the legitimacy of India's territorial claims; he proposed that any negotiations had to take into account the [[facts on the ground]].&lt;ref name="Calvin"&gt;{{cite web |last=Calvin |first =James Barnard |date=April 1984 |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/CJB.htm |title=The China-India Border War |publisher=Marine Corps Command and Staff College |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zhou tried many times to get Nehru to accept conceding Aksai Chin, he visited India four times in 1960.  However, Nehru believed that China did not have a legitimate claim over both of those territories and was not ready to give away any one of them. However, they had different opinions as to the legality of the Simla agreement which eventually led to the inability to reach a decision. Nehru's adamance was seen within China as Indian opposition to Chinese rule in Tibet, as China needed the highway through Aksai Chin to maintain an effective control over the Tibetan plateau.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt;

According to Neville Maxwell, Nehru wasn't ready to simply concede the territory and leave negotiations at that.&lt;ref name="Neville Maxwell"/&gt; He was open to continued negotiations, but did not accept the idea of Indian troops withdrawing from their claimed regions. Nehru stated "''We will negotiate and negotiate and negotiate to the bitter end. I absolutely reject the approach of stopping negotiations at any state.''"&lt;ref name="Neville Maxwell"/&gt; He remained firm that there would be no boundary negotiations until Chinese troops withdrew from Aksai Chin and areas south of the British McMahon Line. This was unacceptable to the Chinese, which never recognized the legal validity of the McMahon Line.&lt;ref name = "Neville Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt; Nehru stated "''We will never compromise on our boundaries, but we are prepared to consider minor adjustments to them and to talk to the other side about them.''" In light of these comments, the international community rallied behind Nehru in claiming that China was at fault in failing to conduct proper negotiations. Maxwell argues that Nehru's words were ambiguous.&lt;ref name="Neville Maxwell"/&gt;

According to the official Indian history:

{{quote|Nehru did not agree to barter away the Aksai Chin area, under illegal occupation of China, in return for China giving up its unreasonable claim to Indian territory south of the McMahon Line.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt;}}

After the talks, India produced its official reports on the talks and translated the Chinese report into English. India believed it would improve a feeling of understanding between the nations. China saw it as an unreasonable attempt by India to secure its claim lines. Nehru's adamance that China withdraw from Aksai Chin and thus abandon the highway was seen as further Indian attempts to undermine China's presence in Tibet. According to John W. Garver, China reached the incorrect conclusion that Nehru was continuing his "grand plans in Tibet".&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt;

==Forward policy==
At the beginning of 1961, Nehru appointed General [[B.M. Kaul]] QMG but he was influential in all army decisions.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaul reorganized the general staff and removed the officers who had resisted the idea of patrolling in disputed areas, although Nehru still refused to increase military spending or otherwise prepare for war.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt; In the summer of 1961, China began patrolling along the McMahon Line. They entered parts of Indian-administered regions and much angered the Indians in doing so. After May 1961 Chinese troops occupied [[Dehra Compass]] and established a post on the [[Chip Chap River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wirzhu5EaqAC|title=India's Ad Hoc Arsenal|last1=Smith|first1=Chris|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnAD5RIZtF4C|title=India's Quest for Security|last1=Kavic|first1=Lorne J.|year=1967|publisher=University of California Press|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese, however, did not believe they were intruding upon Indian territory. In response the Indians launched a policy of creating outposts behind the Chinese troops so as to cut off their supplies and force their return to China.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt; According to the Home Minister in Delhi on 4 February 1962:

{{quote|If the Chinese will not vacate the areas occupied by her, India will have to repeat [[1961 Indian annexation of Goa|what she did in Goa]]. She will certainly drive out the Chinese forces.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt;}}

This has been referred to as the "Forward Policy".&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neville Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Noorani3"&gt;India's Forward Policy, Review author[s]: A. G. Noorani, The China Quarterly © 1970 School of Oriental and African Studies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Gregory Clark, "Remembering a War - The 1962 India-China Conflict", Rediff, [http://www.gregoryclark.net/redif.html] [http://in.rediff.com/news/2002/oct/24chin.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.in/news/181_284247,001300370003.htm Hindustan Times]&lt;/ref&gt; There were eventually 60 such outposts, including 43 north of the McMahon Line.&lt;ref name="Noorani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt;

Kaul was confident through previous diplomacy that the Chinese would not react with force.&lt;ref name="Neville Maxwell"/&gt; According to the Indian Official History, Indian posts and Chinese posts were separated by a narrow stretch of land. China had been steadily spreading into those lands and India reacted with the Forward Policy to demonstrate that those lands were not unoccupied.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt; India, of course, did not believe she was intruding on Chinese territory.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt; British author Neville Maxwell traces this confidence to Mullik, who was in regular contact with the CIA station chief in New Delhi.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt; Mullik may therefore have been aware of Mao's sensitivity concerning U-2 flights.

The initial reaction of the Chinese forces was to withdraw when Indian outposts advanced towards them. However, this appeared to encourage the Indian forces to accelerate their Forward Policy even further. In response, the Central Military Commission adopted a policy of "armed coexistence". In response to Indian outposts encircling Chinese positions, Chinese forces would build more outposts to counter-encircle these Indian positions.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt; This pattern of encirclement and counter-encirclement resulted in an interlocking, chessboard-like deployment of Chinese and Indian forces. Despite the leapfrogging encirclements by both sides, no hostile fire occurred from either side as troops from both sides were under orders to fire only in defense.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt; On the situation, [[Mao Zedong]] commented,

{{quote|Nehru wants to move forward and we won't let him. Originally, we tried to guard against this, but now it seems we cannot prevent it. If he wants to  advance, we might as well adopt armed coexistence. You wave a gun, and I'll wave a gun. We'll stand face to face and can each practice our courage.&lt;ref name = "Garver" /&gt;}}

==Other developments==
At a Communist Party conference in Beijing in January 1962, Chinese President [[Liu Shaoqi]] denounced the [[Great Leap Forward]] as responsible for widespread famine.&lt;ref name="Chang"/&gt; The overwhelming majority of delegates expressed agreement, but Defense Minister [[Lin Biao]] staunchly defended Mao.&lt;ref name="Chang"/&gt; A brief period of liberalization followed while Mao and Lin plotted a comeback.&lt;ref name="Chang"/&gt; Jung Chang writes that China was prepared for war with India after the border clashes in May and June, but were concerned about the [[Republic of China|Nationalists]], which had been making active preparations for invasion from [[Taiwan]], and had moved large forces to the south-east coast.&lt;ref name="Chang"/&gt;

Transcripts from the decision for war was not made by China's leaders until early 6 October 1962, and only then were war plans drawn by China's Central Military Commission.&lt;ref name = "Garver" /&gt; Roderik McFarquhar states, "In May–June 1962, the main concern in Beijing was over the threat of an [[Chinese Civil War|invasion from Taiwan]]... Chinese leaders would have been reluctant to provoke hostilities in the Himalayas, which might have meant diverting military resources from the main danger point along the [[Fujian]] coast."&lt;ref&gt;Noorani, A.G., Fresh Insights into the 1962 War. Frontline. 5–18 December 1998, quoted from Roderick, McFarquhar, The Origins of the Cultural Revolution. Vol. 3, The Coming of the Cataclysm 1961-1966. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian military was not ready for full-scale combat. India had just [[Invasion of Goa|annexed the Portuguese State of India or, Goa]] and was facing border disputes with Pakistan in [[Kashmir]]. The [[Indian National Congress]] proposed non-violent means to solving India's problems, and Indian military leaders, who proposed that India should prepare for a full-scale attack, were ignored or dismissed.

==Early incidents==
Various border conflicts and "military incidents" between India and China flared up throughout the summer and fall of 1962. According to Chinese sources, in June 1962, a minor [[skirmish]] broke out between the two sides, and dozens of members of the [[People's Liberation Army]] killed and wounded. Units of the Indian and Chinese militaries maintained close contact throughout September 1962; however, hostile fire occurred only infrequently.

On 2 May 1962 the Directorate of Military Operations in India had suggested that the air force should be readied for use in NEFA and [[Ladakh]].&lt;ref name="Sukumaran"&gt;[http://www.ciaonet.org/olj/sa/sa_jul03/sa_jul03sur01.html#txt1 CIA Journals] ''1962 India-China War and Kargil 1999: Restrictions on Air Power'' by R. Sukumaran&lt;/ref&gt; The Air Force was considered a feasible way to repel the unbalanced ratio of Chinese troops to Indian troops and the Chinese air force was assessed as only capable of limited strategic raids which could be countered by the Indian air force.&lt;ref name="Sukumaran"/&gt; Indian Air Force soon started reconnaissance flights over the NEFA border. On 7 May 1962 Chinese troops shot down an Indian Dakota plane in which young  officer B. P. Tiwari was lost. Following this incident, the Indian Air Force was told not to plan for close air support.&lt;ref name="Sukumaran"/&gt;

In June, 1962, the Indian Intelligence Bureau said it received information about a Chinese military buildup along the border which could result in a war.&lt;ref name="Sukumaran"/&gt; Information was also received that [[Pakistan]] was considering to attack simultaneously in the west.&lt;ref name="Sukumaran"/&gt; Chinese airfields in Tibet and Yunnan were addressed as a threat to Indian cities, as the PLAAF could conduct heavy bombings through their use of Soviet aeroplanes.&lt;ref name="Sukumaran"/&gt;

On 8 July, the Chinese initiated another diplomatic communication, to protest against an alleged Indian incursion into the [[Galwan River|Galwan Valley]].  According to China Quarterly, the Government of India released press reports to the public indicating that Indian had gained 2,000&amp;nbsp;mi² of territory from the Chinese. However, in their diplomatic reply to the Chinese, India denied that any incident had taken place.&lt;ref name="ChinaQuarterly1962"&gt;{{cite journal

On 10 July 1962, 350 Chinese troops surrounded an Indian post at [[Chushul]], in the Galwan Valley, north of the MacMahon Line.&lt;ref name="Chushul"&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/MONITOR/ISSUE3-3/lns.html Battle of Chushul] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010209084245/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/MONITOR/ISSUE3-3/lns.html |date=9 February 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They used loudspeakers to obtain contact with the [[Gurkha]] forces stationed there.&lt;ref name="Chushul"/&gt; The Chinese troops attempted to convince the Gurkhas that they should not be fighting for India, to cause an abandonment of the post.&lt;ref name="Chushul"/&gt; After a fiery argument the 350 Chinese withdrew from the area.&lt;ref name="Chushul"/&gt;

22 July 1962 saw a change in the Forward Policy, according to the official Indian history of the war. While the Forward Policy was initially intended to prevent the Chinese from advancing into empty areas (by occupying them first), "it was now decided to push back the Chinese from posts they already occupied."&lt;ref name ="officialhistory"&gt;History of the Conflict with China, 1962. P.B. Sinha, A.A. Athale, with S.N. Prasad, chief editor, History Division, Ministry of Defence, Government of India, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Indian troops were previously ordered to fire only in self-defense, all post commanders were now given discretion to open fire upon Chinese forces if threatened.&lt;ref name ="officialhistory"/&gt;

In August, 1962, the Chinese military improved its combat readiness along the McMahon Line, particularly in the [[North East Frontier Agency]], [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]]. In Tibet, there were constructions of ammunition dumps and stockpiling of ammunition, weapons and gasoline, though there were no indications of a manpower buildup. China's preparedness for war strongly contrasted with India's, which had largely neglected its military throughout the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt; Nehru believed that the Himalayas were a large enough defense against China, however, the Korean war had provided China with practice in mountain combat. This neglect on behalf of India would decide numerous pivotal battles where logistical inadequacy and lack of leadership led to defeat after strong starts.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt;

==Confrontation at Thag La==
In June 1962, Indian forces had established an outpost at [[Dhola, Tibet|Dhola]], in the Namkha Chu valley bordering the southern slopes of [[Thag La Ridge]], overlooking the village of [[Le, Tibet|Le]] in Tibet.&lt;ref name="Neville Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt; Based on the treaty map of the 1914 Simla Convention, the McMahon Line lay at 27°45'40''N.&lt;ref name="Neville Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Noorani2"/&gt; However, Dhola post lay about 3.5 mile (6 km) north of the McMahon Line&lt;ref name="Neville Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Joshi"&gt;"Line of Defense", by Manoj Joshi, Times of India, 21 October 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian government maintained that the ''intention'' of the McMahon Line was to set the border along the highest ridges, and that the international border fell on the highest ridges of Thag La, about {{convert|3|to|4|mi}} north of the line drawn by [[Henry McMahon (diplomat)|Henry McMahon]] on the treaty map.&lt;ref name="Neville Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Noorani2"/&gt; Brigadier John Dalvi would later write of this claim: "The Chinese had raised a dispute about the exact alignment of the McMahon Line in the Thag La Ridge area. Therefore the Thag La-Dhola area was not strictly territory that 'we should have been convinced was ours' as directed by the Prime Minister, Mr. Nehru, and someone is guilty of exceeding the limits prescribed by him."&lt;ref name="Noorani3"/&gt;

In August, China issued diplomatic protests which accused India of violating even the McMahon Line,&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt; and Chinese soldiers began occupying positions at the top of Thag La, north of Indian positions.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt;

On 8 September 1962, a 60-strong PLA unit&lt;ref name="Neville Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt; descended from the heights and occupied positions which dominated one of the Indian posts at Dhola. Neither side opened fire for 12 days.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt; Nehru had gone to [[London]] to attend a [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]] and, when told of the act, said to the media that the Indian Army had instructions to "free our territory".

According to the official Indian history, a decision was made on 9 September to evict the Chinese from the southern part of the Thag La Ridge, by force, if necessary.&lt;ref name ="officialhistory"/&gt; Two days later, it was decided that "all forward posts and patrols were given permission to fire on any armed Chinese who entered Indian territory".&lt;ref name ="officialhistory"/&gt;

According to author [[Neville Maxwell]], officers at the Indian Defense Ministry had expressed the concern that even Indian maps showed the entire Namkha Chu valley and Dhola Post-Thag La area as Chinese territory; they were told to ignore the maps.&lt;ref name="Neville Maxwell"/&gt;  However, Nehru's directives to Defense Minister [[V.K. Krishna Menon]] were unclear, and the response, code named Operation LEGHORN, got underway only slowly. As the Chinese numbers were exaggerated to 600 instead of about 50 or 60,&lt;ref name = "Neville Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt; the 9 Punjab battalion, numbering 400 riflemen, was sent to Dhola.&lt;ref name = "officialhistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neville Maxwell"/&gt;

By the time the Indian battalion reached the Thag La Ridge area in the [[Chedong]] region on 16 September, north of the McMahon Line,&lt;ref name="Calvin" /&gt; Chinese units controlled both banks of the Namkha Chu valley. The day after, India's Chief of the Army Staff Gen P N Thapar ordered his men to re-take the Thag La Ridge. According to the official Indian history, on 20 September, Indian eastern command ordered all Indian posts and patrols to engage any Chinese patrols within range of their weapons.&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt;  On 20 September, at one of the bridges on the river a firefight developed, killing nine Chinese and Indian soldiers. Skirmishes continued throughout September.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt;

On 3 October, [[Zhou Enlai]] visited Nehru in [[New Delhi]], promising there would be no war between the nations and reiterating his wishes to solve the dispute diplomatically.

On 4 October, a new corp was created 4 corp, under Lt. Gen. B.M. Kaul,&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt; tasked with evicting the Chinese from Dhola-Thag La&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt; 10 October was the planned date for Operation Leghorn.&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt; Because of the difficulties involved in directly assaulting and taking Thag La, Kaul made the decision instead to occupy nearby Yumtso La to the west, to position his troops behind and dominate the Chinese positions.&lt;ref name = "officialhistory"/&gt;

Brigadier John Dalvi, tasked with taking Yumtso La, argued that he lacked necessary supplies and resources to take the pass.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt; On 9 October, Kaul and Brigadier Dalvi agreed to send a patrol of 50 soldiers to Tseng Jong, the approach to Yumtso La, to occupy the position and provide cover before the rest of the battalion would move forward for the occupation of Yumtso La.&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neville Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt;

On 10 October, these 50 Indian troops were met by an emplaced Chinese position of some 1,000 soldiers. The Chinese troops opened fire on the Indians believing that the Indians had intruded upon Chinese land. The Indians were surrounded by a Chinese positions which used mortar fire. However, they managed to hold off the first Chinese assault, inflicting heavy casualties.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt; In the second assault, the Indians began their retreat, realising the situation was hopeless. The Indian patrol suffered 25 casualties, with the Chinese suffering 33. The Chinese troops held their fire as the Indians retreated, and then buried the Indian dead with military honors, as witnessed by the retreating soldiers. This was the first occurrence of heavy fighting in the war.&lt;ref name="Calvin" /&gt;

This attack had grave implications for India and Nehru tried to solve the issue, but by 18 October it was clear that the Chinese were preparing for an attack on India, with massive troop buildups on the border.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt;

A '''famine''' is a widespread scarcity of [[food]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=James |jstor=30008004 |title=Scarcity and Poor Relief in Eighteenth-Century Ireland: The Subsistence Crisis of 1782–4 |journal=Irish Historical Studiesvolume=28 |date=May 1992 |pages=38–62 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused by several factors including war, inflation, [[crop failure]], [[Demographic trap|population imbalance]], or government policies. This phenomenon is usually accompanied or followed by regional [[malnutrition]], [[starvation]], [[epidemic]], and increased [[death|mortality]]. Every inhabited continent in the world has experienced a period of famine throughout history. In the 19th and 20th century, it was generally Southeast and South Asia, as well as Eastern and Central Europe that suffered the most deaths from famine. The numbers dying from famine began to fall sharply from the 2000s.

Some countries, particularly in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], continue to have extreme cases of famine. Since 2010, Africa has been the most affected continent in the world. As of 2017, the [[United Nations]] has warned some 20 million are at risk in South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria and [[Famine in Yemen|Yemen]]. Agricultural conditions have been fluctuating more and more due to variations in weather, and the distribution of food has been affected by conflict. Most programmes now direct their aid towards Africa.

==Definitions==
According to the [[United Nations]] humanitarian criteria, even if there are food shortages with large numbers of people lacking nutrition, a famine is declared only when certain measures of mortality, malnutrition and hunger are met. The criteria are:
*At least 20% of households in an area face extreme food shortages with a limited ability to cope
*The prevalence of acute malnutrition in children exceeds 30%
*The death rate exceeds two persons per 10,000 persons per day
The declaration of a famine carries no binding obligations on the UN or member states, but serves to focus global attention on the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39025927|title=South Sudan declares famine in Unity State|date=20 February 2017|accessdate=20 February 2017|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|List of famines}}
The cyclical occurrence of famine has been a mainstay of societies engaged in [[subsistence agriculture]] since the dawn of agriculture itself. The frequency and intensity of famine has fluctuated throughout history, depending on changes in food demand, such as  [[population growth]], and supply-side shifts caused by changing [[climate|climatic]] conditions. Famine was first eliminated in Holland and England during the 17th century, due to the [[commercialization]] of agriculture and the implementation of improved techniques to increase [[crop yield]]s.

===Decline of famine===
In the 16th and 17th century, the feudal system began to break down, and more prosperous farmers began to [[enclosure|enclose]] their own land and improve their yields to sell the surplus crops for a profit. These [[capitalism|capitalist]] landowners paid their labourers with [[wage labour|money]], thereby increasing the commercialization of rural society. In the emerging competitive labour market, better techniques for the improvement of labour productivity were increasingly valued and rewarded. It was in the farmer's interest to produce as much as possible on their land in order to sell it to areas that demanded that product. They produced guaranteed [[surplus value|surpluses]] of their crop every year if they could.

Subsistence peasants were also increasingly forced to commercialize their activities because of increasing [[tax]]es. Taxes that had to be paid to central governments in money forced the peasants to produce crops to sell. Sometimes they produced [[industrial crop]]s, but they would find ways to increase their production in order to meet both their subsistence requirements as well as their tax obligations. Peasants also used the new money to purchase manufactured goods. The agricultural and social developments encouraging increased food production were gradually taking place throughout the 16th century, but took off in the early 17th century.

By the 1590s, these trends were sufficiently developed in the rich and commercialized province of [[Holland]] to allow its population to withstand a general outbreak of famine in Western Europe at that time. By that time, the [[Netherlands]] had one of the most commercialized agricultural systems in Europe. They grew many industrial crops such as [[flax]], [[hemp]] and [[hops]]. Agriculture became increasingly specialized and efficient. The efficiency of Dutch agriculture allowed for much more rapid urbanization in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries than anywhere else in Europe. As a result, productivity and wealth increased, allowing the Netherlands to maintain a steady food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bieleman |first=Jan |url=http://www.neha.nl/publications/eshn-4/08-bieleman.pdf |title=Dutch Agriculture in the Golden Age, 1570–1660 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401022510/http://www.neha.nl/publications/eshn-4/08-bieleman.pdf |archivedate=1 April 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1650, English agriculture had also become commercialized on a much wider scale. The last peace-time famine in England was in 1623–24. There were still periods of hunger, as in the Netherlands, but no more famines ever occurred. Common areas for pasture were [[enclosure|enclosed]] for private use and large scale, efficient farms were consolidated. Other technical developments included the draining of marshes, more efficient field use patterns, and the wider introduction of industrial crops. These agricultural developments led to wider prosperity in England and increasing urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curtler |first=W.H.R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yomy8cKVOtkC |title=A Short History of English Agriculture |publisher=Etusevi Company |chapter=ch. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 17th century, English agriculture was the most productive in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burns |first=William E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=59ITUOLbVkoC |title=The Scientific Revolution: An Encyclopedia |year=2001 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both England and the Netherlands, the population stabilized between 1650 and 1750, the same time period in which the sweeping changes to agriculture occurred. Famine still occurred in other parts of [[Europe]], however. In [[East Europe]], famines occurred as late as the twentieth century.

===Attempts at famine alleviation===
[[File:Skibbereen by James Mahony, 1847.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Skibbereen]], Ireland, during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]], 1847 illustration by [[James Mahony]] for the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'']]

Because of the severity of famine, it was a chief concern for governments and other authorities. In pre-industrial Europe, preventing famine, and ensuring timely food supplies, was one of the chief concerns of many governments, although they were severely limited in their options due to limited levels of external trade and an infrastructure and bureaucracy generally too rudimentary to effect real relief. Most governments were concerned by famine because it could lead to [[revolt]] and other forms of social disruption.

By the mid-19th century and the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], it became possible for governments to alleviate the effects of famine through [[price controls]], large scale importation of food products from foreign markets, stockpiling, [[rationing]], regulation of production and [[charity (practice)|charity]]. The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine of 1845]] in Ireland was one of the first famines to feature such intervention, although the government response was often lacklustre. The initial response of the British government to the early phase of the famine was "prompt and relatively successful," according to [[F. S. L. Lyons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Ireland since the famine |first=Francis Stewart Leland |last=Lyons |publisher=Fontana |year=1973 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confronted by widespread crop failure in the autumn of 1845, Prime Minister [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] purchased £100,000 worth of maize and [[cornmeal]] secretly from America. [[Barings Bank|Baring Brothers &amp; Co]] initially acted as purchasing agents for the Prime Minister. The government hoped that they would not "stifle private enterprise" and that their actions would not act as a disincentive to local relief efforts. Due to weather conditions, the first shipment did not arrive in Ireland until the beginning of February 1846.{{sfn|Kinealy|1995|p=38}} The maize corn was then re-sold for a penny a pound.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Disraeli |last=Blake |first=Robert |lccn=67011837 |series=University paperbacks |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QpRnAAAAMAAJ |year=1967 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, Peel moved to repeal the [[Corn Laws]], [[tariff]]s on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high. The famine situation worsened during 1846 and the repeal of the Corn Laws in that year did little to help the starving Irish; the measure split the Conservative Party, leading to the fall of Peel's ministry.{{sfn|Blake|1967|pp=221–41}} In March, Peel set up a programme of public works in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Great Hunger |first=Cecil |last=Woodham-Smith |year=1962 |pages=78–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this promising start, the measures undertaken by Peel's successor, [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], proved comparatively "inadequate" as the crisis deepened. Russell's ministry introduced public works projects, which by December 1846 employed some half million Irish and proved impossible to administer. The government was influenced by a [[laissez-faire]] belief that the market would provide the food needed. It halted government food and relief works, and turned to a mixture of "indoor" and "outdoor" direct relief; the former administered in [[workhouse]]s through the [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]], the latter through [[soup kitchen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Ireland: History of a Nation |first=David |last=Ross |year=2002 |publisher=New Lanark: Geddes &amp; Grosset |isbn=1-84205-164-4 |pages=224, 311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A systematic attempt at creating the necessary regulatory framework for dealing with famine was developed by the [[British Raj]] in the 1880s. In order to comprehensively address the issue of famine, the British created an Indian Famine commission to recommend steps that the government would be required to take in the event of a famine.&lt;ref name="L.

The famine code was also one of the first attempts to scientifically predict famine in order to mitigate its effects. These were finally passed into law in 1883 under [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon|Lord Ripon]].

The [[Indian Famine Codes|Code]] introduced the first [[famine scale]]: three levels of [[food insecurity]] were defined: near-scarcity, scarcity, and famine.  "Scarcity" was defined as three successive years of [[crop failure]], [[crop yield]]s of one-third or one-half normal, and large populations in distress. "Famine" further included a rise in food prices above 140% of "normal", the movement of people in search of food, and widespread mortality.&lt;ref name="L.

During the 20th century, an estimated 70 million people died from [[List of famines|famines across the world]], of whom an estimated 30 million died during the [[Three Years of Natural Disasters|famine of 1958–61]] in [[China]].&lt;ref name=IDSWorkingPaper&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ids.ac.uk/files/dmfile/wp105.pdf|

[[File:Feed The World Logo.GIF|thumb|Feed The World logo designed for [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]].]]
A few of the great famines of the late 20th century were: the [[Biafra|Biafran famine]] in the 1960s, the [[Khmer Rouge]]-caused famine in [[Cambodia]] in the 1970s, the [[North Korea]]n [[North Korean famine|famine of the 1990s]] and the [[Ethiopia]]n [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia|famine of 1983–85]].

The latter event was reported on television reports around the world, carrying footage of starving [[Ethiopia]]ns whose plight was centered around a feeding station near the town of [[Korem]]. This stimulated the first mass movements to end famine across the world.

[[BBC]] newsreader [[Michael Buerk]] gave moving commentary of the tragedy on 23 October 1984, which he described as a "biblical famine". This prompted the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] single, which was organized by [[Bob Geldof]] and featured more than 20 pop stars. The [[Live Aid]] concerts in [[London]] and [[Philadelphia]] raised even more funds for the cause. Hundreds of thousands of people died within one year as a result of the famine, but the publicity Live Aid generated encouraged Western nations to make available enough surplus grain to end the immediate hunger crisis in Africa.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/live-aid-concert|title=Live Aid concert - Jul 13, 1985 - HISTORY.com|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
Until 2017, worldwide deaths from famine had been falling dramatically. The [[World Peace Foundation]] reported that from the 1870s to the 1970s, great famines killed an average of 928,000 people a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.tufts.edu/wpf/famine/|title=Famine Trends Dataset, Tables and Graphs – World Peace Foundation|website=sites.tufts.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, annual deaths had dropped to an average of 75,000, less than 10% of what they had been until the 1970s. That reduction was achieved despite the approximately 150,000 lives lost in the [[2011 East Africa drought|2011 Somalia famine]]. Yet in 2017, the [[UN]] officially declared famine had returned to Africa, with about 20 million people at risk of death from starvation in Nigeria, in [[2017 South Sudan famine|South Sudan]], in [[Famine in Yemen|Yemen]], and in [[2017 Somalian drought|Somalia]].&lt;ref name = "democracyFT"/&gt;

{{category see also|Famines in Africa}}
;Early history
In the mid-22nd century BC, a sudden and short-lived climatic change that caused reduced rainfall resulted in several decades of drought in [[Upper Egypt]]. The resulting famine and civil strife is believed to have been a major cause of the collapse of the [[Old Kingdom]].
An account from the [[First Intermediate Period]] states, "All of Upper Egypt was dying of hunger and people were eating their children." In 1680s, famine extended across the entire [[Sahel]], and in 1738 half the population of [[Timbuktu]] died of famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/~lmilich/desclim.html |title=Len Milich: Anthropogenic Desertification vs 'Natural' Climate Trends |website=Ag.arizona.edu |date=10 August 1997 |accessdate=1 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211081648/http://ag.arizona.edu/~lmilich/desclim.html |archivedate=11 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Egypt]], between 1687 and 1731, there were six famines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Quataert |first=Donald |title=The Ottoman Empire, 1700–1922 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-521-83910-6 |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famine that afflicted Egypt in 1784 cost it roughly one-sixth of its population.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061121232204.htm Icelandic Volcano Caused Historic Famine In Egypt, Study Shows]".

According to John Iliffe, "Portuguese records of [[Angola]] from the 16th century show that a great famine occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys."&lt;ref&gt;John Iliffe (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bNGN2URP_rUC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Africans: the history of a continent''].

The first documentation of weather in West-Central Africa occurs around the mid-16th to 17th centuries in areas such as Luanda Kongo, however, not much data was recorded on the issues of weather and disease except for a few notable documents. The only records obtained are of violence between Portuguese and Africans during the [[Battle of Mbilwa]] in 1665. In these documents the Portuguese wrote of African raids on Portuguese merchants solely for food, giving clear signs of famine. Additionally, instances of [[cannibalism]] by the African Jaga were also more prevalent during this time frame, indicating an extreme deprivation of a primary food source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Joseph C. |title=The Significance of Drought, Disease and Famine in the Agriculturally Marginal Zones of West-Central Africa |journal=Journal of African History |date=January 1982 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=17–61 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=3243140&amp;jid=AFH&amp;volumeId=23&amp;issueId=01&amp;aid=3243132 |accessdate=11 November 2011 |doi=10.1017/S0021853700020235 |pmid=11632226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable period of famine occurred around the turn of the 20th century in the [[Congo Free State]]. In forming this state, Leopold used mass labor camps to finance his empire.&lt;ref name="Masci 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Masci |first=David |title=Famine in Africa |journal=CQ Researcher |date=8 November 2002 |volume=12 |issue=39 |url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre2002110800#top |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period resulted in the death of up to 10 million Congolese from brutality, disease and famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dummett |first=Mark |title=King Leopold's Legacy of DR Congo Violence |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3516965.stm |accessdate=27 November 2011 |date=24 February 2004 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some colonial "pacification" efforts often caused severe famine, notably with the repression of the Maji Maji revolt in [[Tanganyika]] in 1906. The introduction of cash crops such as [[cotton]], and forcible measures to impel farmers to grow these crops, sometimes impoverished the peasantry in many areas, such as northern Nigeria, contributing to greater vulnerability to famine when severe drought struck in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Papaioannou |first=Kostadis J. |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629815000578 |title=Climate shocks and conflict: Evidence from colonial Nigeria |journal=Political Geography |volume=50 |date=January 2016 |pages=33–47 |publisher=Elsevier |doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2015.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large-scale famine occurred in [[Ethiopia]] in 1888 and succeeding years, as the [[1890s African rinderpest epizootic|rinderpest epizootic]], introduced into [[Eritrea]] by infected cattle, spread southwards reaching ultimately as far as [[South Africa]]. In Ethiopia it was estimated that as much as 90 percent of the national herd died, rendering rich farmers and herders destitute overnight. This coincided with [[drought]] associated with an el Nino oscillation, human epidemics of [[smallpox]], and in several countries, intense [[war]]. The [[Famines in Ethiopia|Ethiopian Great famine]] that afflicted Ethiopia from 1888 to 1892 cost it roughly one-third of its population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccb.ucar.edu/ijas/ijasno2/georgis.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911102037/http://www.ccb.ucar.edu/ijas/ijasno2/georgis.html |date=11 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sudan]] the year 1888 is remembered as the worst famine in history, on account of these factors and also the exactions imposed by the [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdist state]].

Records compiled for the [[Himba people|Himba]] recall two droughts from 1910 to 1917. They were recorded by the Himba through a method of [[oral tradition]]. From 1910 to 1911 the Himba described the drought as "drought of the omutati seed" also called ''omangowi'', which means the fruit of an unidentified vine that people ate during the time period. From 1914 to 1916 droughts brought ''katur' ombanda'' or ''kari' ombanda'' which means "the time of eating clothing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Joseph C. |title=The Significance of Drought, Disease and Famine in the Agriculturally Marginal Zones of West-Central Africa |journal=Journal of African History |date=January 1982 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=17–61 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=3243140&amp;jid=AFH&amp;volumeId=23&amp;issueId=01&amp;aid=3243132 |accessdate=27 November 2011 |doi=10.1017/S0021853700020235 |pmid=11632226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the middle part of the 20th century, agriculturalists, economists and geographers did not consider Africa to be especially famine prone. From 1870 to 2010, 87 per cent of deaths from famine occurred in Asia and Eastern Europe, with only 9.2 per cent in Africa.&lt;ref name = "democracyFT"&gt;{{Cite news

Although the drought was brief the main cause of death in Rwanda was due to Belgian prerogatives to acquisition grain from their colony (Rwanda). The increased grain acquisition was related to WW2. This and the drought caused 300,000 Rwandans to perish.&lt;ref name="Masci 2002"/&gt;

From 1967 to 1969 large scale famine occurred in Biafra and Nigeria due to a [[Nigerian Civil War|government blockade of the Breakaway territory]]. It is estimated that 1.5 million people died of starvation due to this famine. Additionally, drought and other government interference with the food supply caused 500 thousand Africans to perish in Central and West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Iliffe |first=John |title=Africans: The History of a Continent |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famine recurred in the early 1970s, when [[Ethiopia]] and the west African [[Sahel]] suffered [[Sahel drought|drought and famine]]. The Ethiopian famine of that time was closely linked to the crisis of feudalism in that country, and in due course helped to bring about the downfall of the Emperor [[Haile Selassie]]. The Sahelian famine was associated with the slowly growing crisis of pastoralism in Africa, which has seen livestock herding decline as a viable way of life over the last two generations.

[[File:Starved girl.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A girl during the [[Nigerian Civil War]] of the late 1960s. Pictures of the famine caused by Nigerian blockade garnered sympathy for the Biafrans worldwide.]]
Famines occurred in [[Sudan]] in the late-1970s and again in 1990 and 1998. The 1980 famine in [[Karamoja]], [[Uganda]] was, in terms of mortality rates, one of the worst in history. 21% of the population died, including 60% of the infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unu.edu/unupress/food/8F091e/8F091E05.htm|title=Food and bulletin volume 9, number 1, march 1987|website=www.unu.edu|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, large scale multilayer drought occurred in the Sudan and Sahelian regions of Africa. This caused famine because even though the Sudanese Government believed there was a surplus of grain, there were local deficits across the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=BE |first=Spiers |title=Famine in Africa |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=9110094&amp;q=Famine+in+Africa&amp;uid=791203203&amp;setcookie=yes |accessdate=27 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823070354/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=9110094&amp;q=Famine+in+Africa&amp;uid=791203203&amp;setcookie=yes |archivedate=23 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1984, television reports describing the Ethiopian famine as "biblical", prompted the [[Live Aid]] concerts in [[London]] and [[Philadelphia]], which raised large sums to alleviate the suffering. A primary cause of the famine (one of the largest seen in the country) is that Ethiopia (and the surrounding Horn) was still recovering from the droughts which occurred in the mid-late 1970s. Compounding this problem was the intermittent fighting due to [[Ethiopian civil war|civil war]], the [[Derg|government]]'s lack of organization in providing relief, and hoarding of supplies to control the population. Ultimately, over 1 million Ethiopians died and over 22 million people suffered due to the prolonged drought, which lasted roughly 2 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopia in Crisis: Famine and Its Aftermath 1984–1988|url=http://countrystudies.us/ethiopia/35.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Somalia became a war zone with no effective government, police, or basic services after the collapse of the dictatorship led by [[Siad Barre]] and the split of power between warlords. This coincided with a massive drought, causing over 300,000 Somalis to perish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Masci |first=David |title=Famine In Africa |journal=CQ Researcher |date=8 November 2002 |volume=12 |issue=39 |url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre2002110800#top}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the start of the 21st century, more effective early warning and humanitarian response actions have reduced the number of deaths by famine markedly. That said, many African countries are not self-sufficient in food production, relying on income from [[cash crop]]s to import food. [[Agriculture]] in Africa is susceptible to [[climate|climatic]] fluctuations, especially [[drought]]s which can reduce the amount of food produced locally. Other agricultural problems include [[Soil fertility|soil infertility]], [[land degradation]] and [[erosion]], swarms of [[desert locust]]s, which can destroy whole crops, and livestock diseases. [[Desertification]] is increasingly problematic: the [[Sahara]] reportedly spreads up to {{convert|30|mi|km|0|order=flip}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0801/p01s02-woaf.html |title=Hunger is spreading in Africa |website=CSMonitor.com |date=1 August 2005 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most serious famines have been caused by a combination of drought, misguided economic policies, and conflict. The 1983–85 famine in Ethiopia, for example, was the outcome of all these three factors, made worse by the Communist government's censorship of the emerging crisis. In Sudan at the same date, drought and economic crisis combined with denials of any food shortage by the then-government of President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], to create a crisis that killed perhaps 250,000 people—and helped bring about a popular uprising that overthrew Nimeiry.

Numerous factors make the [[food security]] situation in Africa tenuous, including political instability, armed conflict and [[civil war]], [[political corruption|corruption]] and mismanagement in handling food supplies, and trade policies that harm African agriculture. An example of a famine created by human rights abuses is the [[1998 Sudan famine]]. [[AIDS]] is also having long-term economic effects on agriculture by reducing the available workforce, and is creating new vulnerabilities to famine by overburdening poor households. On the other hand, in the modern history of Africa on quite a few occasions famines acted as a major source of acute political instability.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Andrey Korotayev]] and [[Daria Khaltourina]] ''[http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=165&amp;Itemid=70 Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends in Africa]''. Moscow: Russia, 2006.  {{ISBN|5-484-00560-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Africa]], if current trends of [[population growth]] and [[soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]] continue, the continent might

Today, famine is most widespread in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], but with exhaustion of food resources, overdrafting of [[groundwater]], wars, internal struggles, and economic failure, famine continues to be a worldwide problem with hundreds of millions of people suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Christian Science Monitor  |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0724/p01s01-wogi.html |title=Rising food prices curb aid to global poor |date=24 July 2007 |work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; These famines cause widespread malnutrition and impoverishment. The [[1984–1985 famine in Ethiopia|famine in Ethiopia]] in the 1980s had an immense death toll, although Asian famines of the 20th century have also produced extensive death tolls. Modern African famines are characterized by widespread destitution and malnutrition, with heightened mortality confined to young children.

;Current initiatives
Against a backdrop of conventional interventions through the state or markets, alternative initiatives have been pioneered to address the problem of food security. One pan-African example is the [[Great Green Wall]]. Another example is the "Community Area-Based Development Approach" to agricultural development ("CABDA"), an NGO programme with the objective of providing an alternative approach to increasing food security in Africa. CABDA proceeds through specific areas of intervention such as the introduction of drought-resistant crops and new methods of food production such as agro-forestry. Piloted in [[Ethiopia]] in the 1990s it has spread to [[Malawi]], [[Uganda]], [[Eritrea]] and [[Kenya]]. In an analysis of the programme by the [[Overseas Development Institute]], CABDA's focus on individual and community capacity-building is highlighted. This enables farmers to influence and drive their own development through community-run institutions, bringing food security to their household and region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===The role of African Unity organization===
The organization of African unity and its role in the African crisis has been interested in the political aspects of the continent, especially the liberation of the occupied parts of it and the elimination of racism. The organization has succeeded in this area but the economic field and development has not succeeded in these fields. African leaders have agreed to waive the role of their organization in the development to the United Nations through the Economic Commission for Africa "ECA".&lt;ref&gt;Al-Kout, Bashir.

These events are comparable, though somewhat smaller in scale, to the ecological trigger events of China's vast 19th-century famines.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Etienne Will, ''Bureaucracy and Famine''&lt;/ref&gt; Qing China carried out its relief efforts, which included vast shipments of food, a requirement that the rich open their storehouses to the poor, and price regulation, as part of a state guarantee of subsistence to the peasantry (known as ''ming-sheng'').

When a stressed monarchy shifted from state management and direct shipments of grain to monetary charity in the mid-19th century, the system broke down. Thus the 1867–68 famine under the [[Tongzhi Restoration]] was successfully relieved but the [[Northern Chinese Famine of 1876–1879|Great North China Famine]] of 1877–78, caused by drought across northern China, was a catastrophe. The province of [[Shanxi]] was substantially depopulated as grains ran out, and desperately starving people stripped forests, fields, and their very houses for food. Estimated mortality is 9.5 to 13 million people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/U8480E/U8480E05.htm Dimensions of need&amp;nbsp;– People and populations at risk].

;Great Leap Forward
The [[Great Chinese Famine|largest famine of the 20th century]], and almost certainly of all time, was the 1958–61 [[Great Leap Forward]] famine in China. The immediate causes of this famine lay in Mao Zedong's ill-fated attempt to transform China from an agricultural nation to an industrial power in one huge leap. Communist Party cadres across China insisted that peasants abandon their farms for collective farms, and begin to produce steel in small foundries, often melting down their farm instruments in the process. Collectivisation undermined incentives for the investment of labor and resources in agriculture; unrealistic plans for decentralized metal production sapped needed labor; unfavorable weather conditions; and communal dining halls encouraged overconsumption of available food.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, G, and Wen, G (1997), "[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Communal%20dining%20and%20the%20Chinese%20Famine%201958-1961&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search Communal dining and the Chinese Famine 1958–1961]"&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the centralized control of information and the intense pressure on party cadres to report only good news—such as [[production quota]]s met or exceeded—that information about the escalating disaster was effectively suppressed. When the leadership did become aware of the scale of the famine, it did little to respond, and continued to ban any discussion of the cataclysm. This blanket suppression of news was so effective that very few Chinese citizens were aware of the scale of the famine, and the greatest peacetime demographic disaster of the 20th century only became widely known twenty years later, when the veil of censorship began to lift.

The exact number of famine deaths during 1958–61 is difficult to determine, and estimates range from 18&lt;ref name=grada9&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gráda |first=Cormac Ó |title=Great Leap into Famine |series=UCD Centre For Economic Research Working Paper Series |year=2011 |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to at least 42 million&lt;ref name=dikotterxii&gt;Dikötter, Frank.

;Khmer Rouge
[[File:Choeungek2.JPG|thumb|Skulls of [[Khmer Rouge]] murder victims at [[Choeung Ek]]]]
In 1975, the [[Khmer Rouge]] took control of [[Cambodia]]. The new government was led by [[Pol Pot]], who desired to turn Cambodia into a communist, agrarian utopia. His regime emptied the cities, abolished currency and private property, and forced Cambodia's population into slavery on communal farms. In less than four years, the Khmer Rouge had executed nearly 1.4 million people, mostly those believed to be a threat to the new ideology.

Due to the failure of the Khmer Rouge's agrarian reform policies, Cambodia experienced widespread famine. As many as one million more died from starvation, disease, and exhaustion resulting from these policies.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, William, ''The Quality of Mercy: Cambodia, Holocaust and Modern Conscience'', Touchstone, 1985, pp. 115–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kaplan"&gt;Kaplan, Robert D., ''The Ends of the Earth'', Vintage, 1996, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 [[Vietnam]] invaded Cambodia and removed the Khmer Rouge from power. By that time about one quarter of Cambodia's population had been killed.

;North Korean famine in the 1990s
[[North Korean famine|Famine struck North Korea in the mid-1990s]], set off by unprecedented floods. This [[Autarky|autarkic]] [[Urban area|urban]], industrial state depended on massive inputs of subsidised goods, including fossil fuels, primarily from the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[People's Republic of China]]. When the Soviet collapse and China's marketization switched trade to a hard currency, full-price basis, North Korea's economy collapsed. The vulnerable agricultural sector experienced a massive failure in 1995–96, expanding to full-fledged famine by 1996–99.

Estimates based on the North Korean census suggest that 240,000 to 420,000 people died as a result of the famine and that there were 600,000 to 850,000 unnatural deaths in North Korea from 1993 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spoorenberg |first1=Thomas |last2=Schwekendiek |first2=Daniel |title=Demographic Changes in North Korea: 1993–2008 |journal=Population and Development Review |volume=38 |issue=1 |date=March 2012 |pages=133–58 |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2012.00475.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea has not yet regained food self-sufficiency and relies on external [[food aid]] from [[China]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Russia]] and the [[United States]].

===India===
{{Main|Famine in India}}
{{See also|Timeline of major famines in India during British rule}}
Owing to its almost entire dependence upon the [[monsoon]] rains, [[India]] is vulnerable to crop failures, which upon occasion deepen into famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Famine |display=Famine § Famines in India |volume=10 |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 14 famines in [[History of India|India]] between the 11th and 17th centuries (Bhatia, 1985). For example, during the 1022–1033 Great famines in India entire provinces were depopulated. Famine in [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] killed at least two million people in 1702–1704. B.M. Bhatia believes that the earlier famines were localised, and it was only after 1860, during the [[British Raj|British rule]], that famine came to signify general shortage of foodgrains in the country. There were approximately 25 major famines spread through states such as [[Tamil Nadu]] in the south, and [[Bihar]] and [[Bengal]] in the east during the latter half of the 19th century.

[[File:India-famine-family-crop-420.jpg|thumb|Victims of the Great Famine of 1876–78 in India during British rule, pictured in 1877.]]
[[Romesh Chunder Dutt]] argued as early as 1900, and present-day scholars such as [[Amartya Sen]] agree, that some historic famines were a product of both uneven rainfall and British economic and administrative policies, which since 1857 had led to the seizure and conversion of local farmland to foreign-owned plantations, restrictions on internal trade, heavy taxation of Indian citizens to support British expeditions in [[Afghanistan]] (see [[European influence in Afghanistan#Second Anglo-Afghan War|The Second Anglo-Afghan War]]), inflationary measures that increased the price of food, and substantial exports of staple crops from India to Britain. (Dutt, 1900 and 1902; Srivastava, 1968; Sen, 1982; Bhatia, 1985.)

Some British citizens, such as [[William Digby (writer)|William Digby]], agitated for policy reforms and famine relief, but [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], the governing British viceroy in India, opposed such changes in the belief that they would stimulate shirking by Indian workers. The first, the [[Bengal famine of 1770]], is estimated to have taken around 10 million lives—one-third of Bengal's population at the time. Other notable famines include the [[Great Famine of 1876–78]], in which 6.1 million to 10.3 million people died&lt;ref name=mikedavis7&gt;Davis, Mike. ''[[Late Victorian Holocausts]]''. 1.

The observations of the Famine Commission of 1880 support the notion that food distribution is more to blame for famines than food scarcity. They observed that each province in British India, including [[Burma]], had a surplus of foodgrains, and the annual surplus was 5.16 million tons (Bhatia, 1970). At that time, annual export of rice and other grains from India was approximately one million tons.

{{cquote|Population growth worsened the plight of the peasantry. As a result of peace and improved sanitation and health, the Indian population rose from perhaps 100 million in 1700 to 300 million by 1920. While encouraging agricultural productivity, the British also provided economic incentives to have more children to help in the fields. Although a similar population increase occurred in Europe at the same time, the growing numbers could be absorbed by industrialization or emigration to the Americas and Australia. India enjoyed neither an industrial revolution nor an increase in food growing. Moreover, Indian landlords had a stake in the cash crop system and discouraged innovation. As a result, population numbers far outstripped the amount of available food and land, creating dire poverty and widespread hunger.|20x|20x|-Craig A.

The [[Great Famine of 1315–1317]] (or to 1322) was the first major food crisis to strike Europe in the 14th century.

Most nobles, cities, and states were slow to respond to the crisis and when they realized its severity, they had little success in securing food for their people. In 1315, in Norfolk England, the price of grain soared from 5 shillings/quarter to 20 shillings/quarter.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=o8ea33eCFQgC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=great+wave+great+famine+inflation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQsO3RzPbWAhWT3oMKHXv-Bb4Q6AEIJTAA#v=snippet&amp;q=1315&amp;f=false] David Hackett Fisher The Great Wave p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famine was a very destabilizing and devastating occurrence. The prospect of [[starvation]] led people to take desperate measures. When scarcity of food became apparent to peasants, they would sacrifice long-term prosperity for short-term survival. They would kill their [[draught animal]]s, leading to lowered production in subsequent years. They would eat their [[seed]] corn, sacrificing next year's crop in the hope that more seed could be found. Once those means had been exhausted, they would take to the road in search of food. They migrated to the cities where merchants from other areas would be more likely to sell their food, as cities had a stronger purchasing power than did rural areas. Cities also administered relief programs and bought grain for their populations so that they could keep order. With the confusion and desperation of the migrants, [[crime]] would often follow them. Many peasants resorted to [[bandit]]ry in order to acquire enough to eat.

One famine would often lead to difficulties in the following years because of lack of seed stock or disruption of routine, or perhaps because of less-available labour. Famines were often interpreted as signs of [[God]]'s displeasure. They were seen as the removal, by God, of His gifts to the people of the Earth. Elaborate religious processions and rituals were made to prevent God's wrath in the form of famine.

;16th century
[[File:Goya-Guerra (59).jpg|thumb|An engraving from [[Francisco Goya|Goya]]'s ''[[Disasters of War]]'', showing starving women, doubtless inspired by the terrible famine that struck [[Madrid]] in 1811–1812.]]
During the 15th century to the 18th century, famines in Europe became more frequent due to the [[Little Ice Age]]. The colder climate resulted in harvest failures and shortfalls that led to a rise in [[conspiracy theories]] concerning the causes behind these famines, such as the [[Pacte de Famine]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Steven. ''The Famine Plot Persuasion in Eighteenth-Century France''. Pennsylvania: Diane Publishing Co, 1982. {{ISBN|0-87169-723-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1590s saw the worst famines in centuries across all of Europe. Famine had been relatively rare during the 16th century. The economy and population had grown steadily as subsistence populations tend to when there is an extended period of relative peace (most of the time). Although peasants in areas of high population density, such as northern Italy, had learned to increase the yields of their lands through techniques such as promiscuous culture, they were still quite vulnerable to famines, forcing them to work their land even more intensively.

The great famine of the 1590s began a period of famine and decline in the 17th century. The price of grain, all over Europe was high, as was the population. Various types of people were vulnerable to the succession of bad harvests that occurred throughout the 1590s in different regions. The increasing number of wage labourers in the countryside were vulnerable because they had no food of their own, and their meager living was not enough to purchase the expensive grain of a bad-crop year. Town labourers were also at risk because their wages would be insufficient to cover the cost of grain, and, to make matters worse, they often received less money in bad-crop years since the disposable income of the wealthy was spent on grain. Often, unemployment would be the result of the increase in grain prices, leading to ever-increasing numbers of urban poor.

All areas of Europe were badly affected by the famine in these periods, especially rural areas. The Netherlands was able to escape most of the damaging effects of the famine, though the 1590s were still difficult years there. [[Amsterdam]]'s grain trade with the [[Baltic region|Baltic]], guaranteed a food supply.

;17th century
The years around 1620 saw another period of famine sweep across Europe. These famines were generally less severe than the famines of twenty-five years earlier, but they were nonetheless quite serious in many areas. Perhaps the worst famine since 1600, the great famine in [[Finland]] in 1696, killed one-third of the population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euro.who.int/document/peh-ehp/nehapfin.pdf {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009053403/http://www.euro.who.int/document/peh-ehp/nehapfin.pdf |date=9 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devastating harvest failures afflicted the northern [[Italy|Italian]] economy from 1618 to 1621, and it did not recover fully for centuries. There were serious famines in the late-1640s and less severe ones in the 1670s throughout northern Italy.

Over two million people died in two famines in [[France]] between 1693 and 1710. Both famines were made worse by ongoing wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ó Gráda |first=Cormac |last2=Chevet |first2=Jean-Michel |year=2002 |title=Famine And Market In ''Ancient Régime'' France |journal=The Journal of Economic History |pmid=17494233 |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=706–33 |doi=10.1017/S0022050702001055 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=122547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other areas of Europe have known famines much more recently. [[France]] saw famines as recently as the 19th century. The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in [[Ireland]], 1846–1851, caused by the failure of the potato crop over a few years, resulted in 1,000,000 dead and another 2,000,000 [[refugees]] fleeing to Britain, Australia and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rubinstein |first=W.

Famine still occurred in [[Eastern Europe]] during the 20th century. Droughts and famines in [[Imperial Russia]] are known to have happened every 10 to 13 years, with average droughts happening every 5 to 7 years. Russia experienced eleven major famines between 1845 and 1922, one of the worst being the [[Russian famine of 1891-2|famine of 1891–92]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.alanmacfarlane.com/savage/A-FAM.PDF The Dimension of Famine]" (PDF).

The [[Hunger Plan]], i.e. the Nazi plan to starve large sections of the Soviet population, caused the deaths of many. The Russian Academy of Sciences in 1995 reported civilian victims in the USSR at German hands, including Jews, totalled 13.7 million dead, 20% of the 68 million persons in the occupied USSR. This included 4.1 million famine and disease deaths in occupied territory. There were an additional estimated 3 million famine deaths in areas of the USSR not under German occupation.&lt;ref&gt;The Russian Academy of Science Rossiiskaia Akademiia nauk.

The 872 days of the [[Siege of Leningrad]] (1941–1944) caused unparalleled famine in the Leningrad region through disruption of utilities, water, energy and food supplies. This resulted in the deaths of about one million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=24841 |title=The Moscow Times&amp;nbsp;— News, Business, Culture &amp; Multimedia from Russia |website=Sptimes.ru |date= |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famine even struck in Western Europe during the [[Second World War]]. In the [[Netherlands]], the ''[[Dutch famine of 1944|Hongerwinter]]'' of 1944 killed approximately 30,000 people. Some other areas of Europe also experienced famine at the same time.

Beginning in the 20th century, nitrogen [[fertilizer]]s, new [[pesticide]]s, [[desert farming]], and other agricultural technologies began to be used to increase food production, in part to combat famine. Between 1950 and 1984, as the [[Green Revolution]] influenced [[agriculture]], world grain production increased by 250%.  Developed nations have shared these technologies with developing nations with a famine problem. However, as early as 1995, there were signs that these new developments may contribute to the decline of arable land (e.g. persistence of pesticides leading to [[soil contamination]], [[Soil salinity|salt accumulation due to irrigation]], [[erosion]]).

In 1994, David Pimentel, professor of ecology and [[agriculture]] at [[Cornell University]], and Mario Giampietro, senior researcher at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN), estimated the maximum [[U.S. population]] for a [[sustainability|sustainable economy]] at 200 million.&lt;ref&gt;David Pimentel, Mario Giampietro 1994.

Other countries affected include [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], and [[Mexico]]. This will eventually lead to [[water scarcity]] and cutbacks in grain harvest. Even while overexploiting its [[aquifers]], China has developed a [[grain]] deficit, contributing to the upward pressure on grain prices. Most of the three billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing [[water shortages]].

After [[China]] and [[India]], there is a second tier of smaller countries with large water deficits&amp;nbsp;– [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Mexico]], and [[Pakistan]].

Evan Fraser, a geographer at the [[University of Guelph]] in [[Ontario]], Canada, explores the ways in which [[climate change]] may affect future famines.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, E. 2007a. Travelling in antique lands: Studying past famines to understand present vulnerabilities to climate change. Climate Change 83:495–514.&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, he draws on a range of historic cases where relatively small environmental problems triggered famines as a way of creating theoretical links between climate and famine in the future.  Drawing on situations as diverse as the [[Great Irish Potato Famine]],&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, E. 2003. Social vulnerability and ecological fragility: building bridges between social and natural sciences using the Irish Potato Famine as a case study. Conservation Ecology 7:9 (online).&lt;/ref&gt; a series of weather induced famines in [[Asia]] during the late 19th century, and famines in Ethiopia during the 1980s, he concludes there are three "lines of defense" that protect a community's [[food security]] from [[environmental change]]. The first line of defense is the [[Agroecosystem|agro-ecosystem]] on which food is produced: diverse ecosystems with well managed soils high in [[organic matter]] tend to be more resilient. The second line of defense is the wealth and skills of individual households: If those households affected by bad weather such as [[drought]] have savings or skills they may be able to do all right despite the bad weather.  The final line of defense is created by the formal institutions present in a society.  Governments, churches, or NGOs must be willing and able to mount effective relief efforts. Pulling this together, Evan Fraser argues that if an [[ecosystem]] is resilient enough, it may be able to withstand weather-related shocks. But if these shocks overwhelm the ecosystem's line of defense, it is necessary for the household to adapt using its skills and savings. If a problem is too big for the family or household, then people must rely on the third line of defense, which is whether or not the formal institutions present in a society are able to provide help. Evan Fraser concludes that in almost every situation where an environmental problem triggered a famine you see a failure in each of these three lines of defense.&lt;ref name="Fraser2006"&gt;Fraser, E.

Definitions of famines are based on three different categories—these include food supply-based, food consumption-based and mortality-based definitions. Some definitions of famines are:
* Blix&amp;nbsp;– Widespread food shortage leading to significant rise in regional death rates.{{sfn|Blix|Svensk näringsforskning|1971|p=}}
* Brown and Eckholm&amp;nbsp;– Sudden, sharp reduction in food supply resulting in widespread hunger.{{sfn|Brown|Eckholm|1974|p=}}
* Scrimshaw&amp;nbsp;– Sudden collapse in level of food consumption of large numbers of people.{{sfn|Scrimshaw|1987|p=}}
* Ravallion&amp;nbsp;– Unusually high mortality with unusually severe threat to food intake of some segments of a population.{{sfn|Ravallion|1996|p=2}}
* Cuny&amp;nbsp;– A set of conditions that occurs when large numbers of people in a region cannot obtain sufficient food, resulting in widespread, acute malnutrition.{{sfn|Cuny|1999|p=}}

Food shortages in a population are caused either by a lack of food or by difficulties in food distribution; it may be worsened by natural climate fluctuations and by extreme political conditions related to oppressive government or warfare. The conventional explanation until 1981 for the cause of famines was the Food availability decline (FAD) hypothesis. The assumption was that the central cause of all famines was a decline in food availability.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2010|p=}} However, FAD could not explain why only a certain section of the population such as the agricultural laborer was affected by famines while others were insulated from famines.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} Based on the studies of some recent famines, the decisive role of FAD has been questioned and it has been suggested that the causal mechanism for precipitating starvation includes many variables other than just decline of food availability. According to this view, famines are a result of entitlements,  the theory being proposed is called the "failure of exchange entitlements" or FEE.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} A person may own various commodities that can be exchanged in a market economy for the other commodities he or she needs. The exchange can happen via trading or production or through a combination of the two. These entitlements are called trade-based or production-based entitlements. Per this proposed view, famines are precipitated due to a breakdown in the ability of the person to exchange his entitlements.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} An example of famines due to FEE is the inability of an agricultural laborer to exchange his primary entitlement, i.e., labor for rice when his employment became erratic or was completely eliminated.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}}

According to the Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), global [[climate change]] is additionally challenging the Earth's ability to produce food, potentially leading to famine.&lt;ref name="Psrccaf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and Famine|url=http://www.psr.org/resources/climate-change-and-famine.html|publisher=Physicians for Social Responsibility|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some elements make a particular region more vulnerable to famine. These include poverty, [[population growth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14291581 |title='Top 10 culprits' for Horn of Africa hunger |publisher=BBC News |date=26 July 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an inappropriate social infrastructure, a suppressive political regime, and a weak or under-prepared government.{{sfn|Ravallion|1996|p=1}}

According to a FEWSNET report, "Famines are not natural phenomena, they are catastrophic political failures."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/reactions/fewsnet-report-260000-people-died-somalia-famine&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate and population pressure===
[[File:Starved child.jpg|thumb|upright|A child suffering extreme starvation in [[India]], 1972]]
Many famines are caused by imbalance of food production compared to the large populations of countries whose [[Human overpopulation|population exceeds the regional carrying capacity]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Historically, famines have occurred from agricultural problems such as [[drought]], crop failure, or [[infectious disease|pestilence]]. Changing weather patterns, the ineffectiveness of medieval governments in dealing with crises, wars, and [[List of epidemics|epidemic diseases]] such as the [[Black Death]] helped to cause hundreds of famines in [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]], including 95 in Britain and 75 in France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3609390/Poor-studies-will-always-be-with-us.html "Poor studies will always be with us"], ''The Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the [[Hundred Years' War]], crop failures and epidemics reduced the population by two-thirds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3031536.html Don O'Reilly, "Hundred Years' War: Joan of Arc and the Siege of Orléans] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109043743/http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3031536.html |date=9 November 2006 }}", ''TheHistoryNet.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure of a harvest or change in conditions, such as [[drought]], can create a situation whereby large numbers of people continue to live where the [[carrying capacity]] of the land has temporarily dropped radically. Famine is often associated with [[subsistence]] agriculture. The total absence of agriculture in an economically strong area does not cause famine; [[Arizona]] and other wealthy regions import the vast majority of their food, since such regions produce sufficient economic goods for trade.

Famines have also been caused by volcanism. The 1815 eruption of the [[Mount Tambora]] volcano in Indonesia caused crop failures and famines worldwide and caused the worst famine of the 19th century. The current consensus of the scientific community is that the aerosols and dust released into the upper atmosphere causes cooler temperatures by preventing the sun's energy from reaching the ground. The same mechanism is theorized to be caused by very large meteorite impacts to the extent of causing mass extinctions.

===State-sponsored famines===
In certain cases, such as the [[Great Leap Forward]] in China (which produced the [[Great Chinese Famine|largest famine in absolute numbers]]), [[North Korean famine|North Korea in the mid-1990s]], or [[Zimbabwe]] in the early-2000s, famine can occur because of government policy.

[[File:GolodomorKharkiv.jpg|thumb|The government's [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization]] of agriculture was one of the main causes of the [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933]].]]
In 1932, under the rule of the USSR, [[Ukraine]] experienced one of its largest famines when between 2.4 and 7.5 million peasants died as a result of a state sponsored famine. It was termed the [[Holodomor]], suggesting that it was a deliberate campaign of repression designed to eliminate resistance to collectivization. Forced grain quotas imposed upon the rural peasants and a brutal reign of terror contributed to the widespread famine. The Soviet government continued to deny the problem and it did not provide aid to the victims nor did it accept foreign aid. Several contemporary scholars dispute the notion that the famine was deliberately inflicted by the Soviet government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Robert|authorlink1=Robert William Davies|last2=Wheatcroft|first2=Stephen|authorlink2=Stephen G.

In 1958 in China, [[Mao Zedong]]'s Communist Government launched the [[Great Leap Forward]] campaign, aimed at rapidly industrializing the country.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/02/16/reviews/970216.16ebersta.html|

Barely enough grain was left for the peasants, and starvation occurred in many rural areas. Exportation of grain continued despite the famine and the government attempted to conceal it. While the famine is attributed to unintended consequences, it is believed that the government refused to acknowledge the problem, thereby further contributing to the deaths. In many instances, peasants were persecuted. Between 20 and 45 million people perished in this famine, making it one of the deadliest famines to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html |title=Mao's Great Leap Forward 'killed 45 million in four years' |last=Akbar |first=Arifa |date=17 September 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2010 |location=London |work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malawi ended its famine by subsidizing farmers despite the strictures imposed by the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name=newyorktimes /&gt; During the 1973 [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia#Wollo famine|Wollo Famine]] in [[Ethiopia]], food was shipped out of Wollo to the capital city of [[Addis Ababa]], where it could command higher prices. In the late-1970s and early-1980s, residents of the [[dictatorship]]s of Ethiopia and [[Sudan]] suffered massive famines, but the [[democracy]] of [[Botswana]] avoided them, despite also suffering a severe drop in national food production. In [[Somalia]], famine occurred because of a [[failed state]].

The [[famine in Yemen]] was a direct result of the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]] and the [[Blockade of Yemen|blockade]] imposed by Saudi Arabia and its allies, including the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Julian Borger]] |title=Saudi-led naval blockade leaves 20m Yemenis facing humanitarian disaster |date=4 June 2016 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/05/saudi-led-naval-blockade-worsens-yemen-humanitarian-disaster}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://theintercept.com/2017/11/14/congress-yemen-war-unauthorized/ Congress Votes to Say It Hasn’t Authorized War in Yemen, Yet War in Yemen Goes On]".

According to Amartya Sen (1999)  “there has never been a famine in a functioning multiparty democracy”. Hasell and Roser have demonstrated that while there have been a few minor exceptions, famines rarely occur in democratic systems but are strongly correlated with [[Autocracy|autocratic]] and [[Colonialism|colonial]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ourworldindata.org/famines/|title=Famines|work=Our World in Data|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famine prevention==
[[File:Famine in Algeria 1869.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A starving child during the 1869 famine in [[Algeria]].]]
Relief technologies, including [[immunization]], improved [[public health]] infrastructure, general food rations and supplementary feeding for vulnerable children, has provided temporary mitigation to the mortality impact of famines, while leaving their economic consequences unchanged, and not solving the underlying issue of too large a regional population relative to food production capability. Humanitarian crises may also arise from [[genocide]] campaigns, [[civil war]]s, [[refugee]] flows and episodes of extreme violence and state collapse, creating famine conditions among the affected populations.

Despite repeated stated intentions by the world's leaders to end hunger and famine, famine remains a chronic threat in much of Africa, Eastern Europe, the Southeast, South Asia, and the Middle East. In July 2005, the [[Famine Early Warning Systems Network]] labelled [[Niger]] with emergency status, as well as [[Chad]], [[Ethiopia]], [[South Sudan]], [[Somalia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. In January 2006, the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] warned that 11 million people in Somalia, [[Kenya]], [[Djibouti]] and Ethiopia were in danger of starvation due to the combination of severe drought and military conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000206/index.html|title=Millions of people are on the brink of starvation in the Horn of Africa|website=Fao.org|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the most serious humanitarian crisis in Africa was in [[Sudan]]'s region [[Darfur]].

[[Frances Moore Lappé]], later co-founder of the [[Institute for Food and Development Policy]] (Food First) argued in ''[[Diet for a Small Planet]]'' (1971) that [[vegetarian]] diets can provide food for larger populations, with the same resources, compared to omnivorous diets.

Noting that modern famines are sometimes aggravated by misguided economic policies, political design to impoverish or marginalize certain populations, or acts of war, political economists have investigated the political conditions under which famine is prevented. Economist [[Amartya Sen]]{{refn|Sen is known for his assertion that famines do not occur in democracies in much the same way that [[Adam Smith]] is associated with the "[[invisible hand]]" and [[Joseph Schumpeter]] with "[[creative destruction]]".{{sfn|Massing|2003|p=1}}|group=note}} states that the liberal institutions that exist in India, including competitive elections and a free press, have played a major role in preventing famine in that country since independence. [[Alex de Waal]] has developed this theory to focus on the "political contract" between rulers and people that ensures famine prevention, noting the rarity of such political contracts in Africa, and the danger that international relief agencies will undermine such contracts through removing the locus of accountability for famines from national governments.

[[File:Russia Famine Saratov 1921.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A woman, a man and a child, all three dead from starvation. [[Russia]], 1921.]]
The demographic impacts of famine are sharp. Mortality is concentrated among children and the elderly. A consistent demographic fact is that in all recorded famines, male mortality exceeds female, even in those populations (such as northern India and Pakistan) where there is a male longevity advantage during normal times. Reasons for this may include greater female resilience under the pressure of malnutrition, and possibly female's naturally higher percentage of body fat. Famine is also accompanied by lower fertility. Famines therefore leave the reproductive core of a population—adult women—lesser affected compared to other population categories, and post-famine periods are often characterized a "rebound" with increased births.

Even though the theories of [[Thomas Malthus]] would predict that famines reduce the size of the population commensurate with available food resources, in fact even the most severe famines have rarely dented population growth for more than a few years. The mortality in China in 1958–61, Bengal in 1943, and Ethiopia in 1983–85 was all made up by a growing population over just a few years. Of greater long-term demographic impact is emigration: Ireland was chiefly depopulated after the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|1840s famines]] by waves of emigration.

===Food security===
{{Main|food security}}
Long term measures to improve food security, include investment in modern [[agriculture]] techniques, such as [[fertilizers]] and [[irrigation]],&lt;ref name=obama&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/world/europe/09food.html "Obama enlists major powers to aid poor farmers with $15 billion"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but can also include strategic national [[food storage]].

[[World Bank]] strictures restrict government subsidies for farmers, and increasing use of fertilizers is opposed by some environmental groups because of its unintended consequences: adverse effects on water supplies and habitat.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 "Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jan/borlaug/borlaug.htm |title=Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity |publisher=The Atlantic |date=5 January 2016 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Norman Borlaug.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Norman Borlaug]], father of the [[Green Revolution]], is often credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation.]]
The effort to bring modern agricultural techniques found in the [[Western world]], such as [[nitrogen]] [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticides]], to the [[Indian Sub-continent]], called the [[Green Revolution]], resulted in decreases in malnutrition similar to those seen earlier in Western nations. This was possible because of existing [[infrastructure]] and institutions that are in short supply in [[Africa]], such as a system of roads or public [[seed]] companies that made seeds available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/world/africa/10rice.html|title=In Africa, Prosperity From Seeds Falls Short|date=10 October 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting [[farmer]]s in areas of food insecurity, through such measures as free or subsidized [[fertilizer]]s and [[seed]]s, increases food harvest and reduces food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Christian Science Monitor  |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0618/p07s01-woaf.html |title=How a Kenyan village tripled its corn harvest |date=18 June 2008 |work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] and some rich nations press nations that depend on them for aid to cut back or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, in the name of [[privatization]] even as the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] extensively subsidized their own farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4678592.stm|title=BBC NEWS&amp;nbsp;— Africa&amp;nbsp;— Zambia: Fertile but hungry|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relief===
{{Main|Famine relief}}
There is a growing realization among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers instead of food is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry, particularly in areas where food is available but unaffordable.&lt;ref name=csmonitor&gt;{{cite web |author=The Christian Science Monitor |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0604/p01s02-woaf.html |title=UN aid debate: Give cash, not food? |date=4 June 2008 |work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]]' [[World Food Program]] (WFP), the biggest non-governmental distributor of food, announced that it will begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas, which Josette Sheeran, the WFP's executive director, described as a "revolution" in food aid.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;&lt;ref name=wfp&gt;http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212124012/http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899 |date=12 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aid agency [[Concern Worldwide]] is piloting a method through a [[mobile phone]] operator, Safaricom, which runs a money transfer program that allows cash to be sent from one part of the country to another.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;

However, for people in a [[drought]] living a long way from and with limited access to [[markets]], delivering food may be the most appropriate way to help.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt; [[Fred Cuny]] stated that "the chances of saving lives at the outset of a [[relief]] operation are greatly reduced when food is imported.

[[Ethiopia]] has been pioneering a program that has now become part of the World Bank's prescribed recipe for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author =The Christian Science Monitor |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0506/p01s06-woaf.html?page=2 |title=Ethiopia: A model of African food aid is now in trouble |date=6 May 2008 |work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Green Revolution]] was widely viewed as an answer to famine in the 1970s and 1980s. Between 1950 and 1984, hybrid strains of high-yielding crops transformed agriculture around the globe and world grain production increased by 250%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6496585.stm|title=Special Reports&amp;nbsp;– The limits of a Green Revolution?|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who|date=August 2013}} criticize the process, stating that these new high-yielding crops require more chemical [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s, which can harm the environment.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Although these high-yielding crops make it technically possible to feed more people, there are indications that regional food production has peaked in many world sectors, due to certain strategies associated with intensive agriculture such as [[groundwater]] [[overdrafting]] and overuse of [[pesticide]]s and other agricultural chemicals.

===Levels of food insecurity===
{{Main|Famine scales}}
In modern times, local and political governments and [[non-governmental organization]]s that deliver famine relief have limited resources with which to address the multiple situations of food insecurity that are occurring simultaneously.  Various methods of categorizing the gradations of food security have thus been used in order to most efficiently allocate food relief.  One of the earliest were the [[Indian Famine Codes]] devised by the British in the 1880s. The Codes listed three stages of food insecurity: near-scarcity, scarcity and famine, and were highly influential in the creation of subsequent famine warning or measurement systems.  The early warning system developed to monitor the region inhabited by the [[Turkana people]] in northern [[Kenya]] also has three levels, but links each stage to a pre-planned response to mitigate the crisis and prevent its deterioration

The experiences of famine relief organizations throughout the world over the 1980s and 1990s resulted in at least two major developments: the "livelihoods approach" and the increased use of nutrition indicators to determine the severity of a crisis. Individuals and groups in food stressful situations will attempt to cope by rationing consumption, finding alternative means to supplement [[income]], etc., before taking desperate measures, such as selling off plots of [[agriculture|agricultural]] land. When all means of self-support are exhausted, the affected population begins to migrate in search of food or fall victim to outright mass [[starvation]]. Famine may thus be viewed partially as a social phenomenon, involving [[Market (economics)|market]]s, the price of food, and social support structures. A second lesson drawn was the increased use of rapid nutrition assessments, in particular of children, to give a quantitative measure of the famine's severity.

Since 2003, many of the most important organizations in famine relief, such as the [[World Food Programme]] and the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]], have adopted a five-level scale measuring intensity and magnitude. The intensity scale uses both livelihoods' measures and measurements of mortality and child malnutrition to categorize a situation as food secure, food insecure, food crisis, famine, severe famine, and extreme famine. The number of deaths determines the magnitude designation, with under 1000 fatalities defining a "minor famine" and a "catastrophic famine" resulting in over 1,000,000 deaths.

==Society and culture==
Famine personified as an [[allegory]] is found in some cultures, e.g. one of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] in Christian tradition,  the [[fear gorta]] of Irish folklore, or the [[Wendigo]] of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tradition.

[[File:FestaJunina.jpg|thumb|250px|A typical Brazilian festa junina]]

'''''Festa Junina''''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈfɛstɐ ʒuˈninɐ}}, ''June Festival''), also known as the '''''festa de São João''''' for their part in celebrating the [[nativity of St. John the Baptist]] (June 24), are the annual [[Brazil]]ian celebrations adapted from European [[Midsummer]] that take place in the southern midwinter. These festivities, which were introduced by the Portuguese during [[Colonial Brazil|the colonial period]] (1500-1822), are celebrated during the month of June nationwide. The festival is mainly celebrated on the eves of the [[Catholic]] solemnities of [[Anthony of Padua|Saint Anthony]], [[Saint John the Baptist]], and [[Saint Peter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.suapesquisa.com/musicacultura/historia_festa_junina.htm|title=História da Festa Junina e tradiçõe|last=Various Authors|first=|date=1999|website=Sua Pesquisa|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Northeastern Brazil]] is largely arid or semi-arid these festivals not only coincide with the [[Climate of Brazil|end of the rainy seasons]] of most states in the northeast but they also provide the people with an opportunity to give thanks to [[John the Baptist|Saint John]] for the rain. They also celebrate [[rural]] life and feature typical clothing, food, dance (particularly [[quadrille|quadrilha]], which is similar to [[square dancing]]).

[[File:Riobranco gameleira.jpg|thumb|200px|An arraial in [[Rio Branco, Acre|Rio Branco]], [[Acre (state)|Acre]]]]
 
== Origins and history ==
Various aspects of the festival originate from the European Midsummer celebrations, such as the creation of a large bonfire. Many of these celebrations now occur with influence from Brazilian rural society. The festivities usually take place in an ''arraial'', a huge tent made of raw material (with a [[Thatching|thatched roof]]) that was reserved for important parties in older Brazilian rural areas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Festas juninas, festas de São João: origens, tradições e história|last=Rangel|first=Lúcia Helena Vitalli|publisher=Publishing Solutions|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Brazilian climate differs greatly from Europe, Brazilian participants would often use the festival as a way to show gratitude for rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.evesly.com/life-style/festa-junina-the-winter-fest-of-brazil/|title=Festa junina – the Winter Fest of Brazil|last=Bholi|first=Shelly|date=June 28, 2017|website=Evesly|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of a large fire, known as a fogueira, is lit during the festival. This originates from a Catholic story of a fire being lit to warn [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] about the birth of St. John the Baptist, and thus to have her assistance after childbirth, [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]] would have to light a fire on a hill.

Most festivals occurred away from the coast line, closer to the interior where many larger plantations were.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While still ruled by Portugal, coastline cities, in [[Pernambuco]] especially, became industrialized and saw much greater economic prosperity. Hoping to further this growth, [[John IV of Portugal|King Dom João]] modified his economic policy to favor cities such as [[Recife]] rather than rural interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14068000|title=The mansions and the shanties : the making of modern Brazil|last=1900-1987.|first=Freyre, Gilberto,|date=1986|publisher=University of California Press|others=De Onís, Harriet, 1899-1969.|isbn=9780520056817|edition= 1st complete paperback|location=Berkeley|oclc=14068000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Festa Junina continued, its practice in modern cities became much larger. Today, the sizes of the celebrations have surpassed that of Europe. Although they are primarily practiced and hosted by schools, many cities host their own major celebration. In [[Caruaru|Caruaru, Pernambuco]], a celebration of the festival in 2011 saw approximately 1.5 million attendees, earning a Guinness Book World Record for having the largest celebration of the festival in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Nc10VML6|title=Na maior festa de São João do mundo, público chega a 1,5 milhão de pessoas|last=Bastos|first=Ângela|date=June 24, 2011|website=Diário Catarinense|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditions ==
In Brazil, the festival is primarily practiced by rural farmers, known as [[caipira]]s.  Men dress up as farm boys with large straw hats and women wear pigtails, freckles, painted gap teeth and red-checkered dresses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dances throughout the festival surround "quadrilha". Most of these dances emerge from 19th century Europe, which were brought by the Portuguese. The "''quadrilha''" features couple formations around a mock wedding whose bride and groom are the central focus of the dance. This reflects the fertility of the land. There are various types of dance within the category of quadrilha, all including a heterosexual couple as the primary characters. Cana-Verde, a subcategory of [[fandango]] dance styles, are more popular in the south and are primarily improvised. Dances involving [[Bumba Meu Boi]] are also present during this festival. Here, the dance revolves around a women desiring to eat the tongue of an ox. Her husband kills the ox, to the dismay of the ox's owner. A healer enters and resuscitates the ox, and all participants celebrate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Accompanying these dances is a genre of music known as [[Forró]]. This traditional genre primarily uses [[accordion]]s and triangles, and focuses on the life and struggle of caiprias. The music greatly focuses on [[saudade]], a feeling of nostalgia or forlorn, for rural farm life. More modern versions of the music can include [[guitar]]s, [[fiddle]]s, and [[Drum kit|drums]].

Many games targeted at children are present at Festa Juninas, especially at festivals hosted in schools serving as a fundrasier.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CAMPOS|first=JUDAS TADEU DE|date=2007|title=FESTAS JUNINAS NAS ESCOLAS: LIÇÕES DE PRECONCEITOS|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/es/v28n99/a15v2899.pdf|journal=Campinas|volume=28|pages=589–606|via=scielo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Pescaria: Children use a fishing rod to pick up cans or paper designed to look like fish from a box. 
* Corrida do saci: Children hop on one leg to the end of a line in a race, mimicking the movement of the [[Saci (Brazilian folklore)|saci perere]]. 
* Corrida de três pés: A three-legged race, where 2 participants tie one of their legs to their partner's leg, and race others. 
* Jogo de argolas: [[Ring toss|Ring Toss]]. Rings are thrown onto bottles in an attempt to land around the neck. 
* Tiro ao Alvo: [[Darts|Dart]] toss. Darts are thrown in an attempt to gain the most points.

Winners of these games are often given miscellaneous prizes.

== Modern criticisms ==
Today, São João festivities are extremely popular in Brazil's largest cities. The presence of a festival celebrating rural life in an urban setting has revealed modern stereotypes of caipiras. Those residing in larger cities believe rural farmers to be less educated and unable to properly socialize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://journals.openedition.org/terrabrasilis/341|title=O Sertão: Um ‘Outro’ Geográfico|last=Moraes|first=Antonio Carlos Robert|date=|website=Terra Brasilis|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often reflected in caricatures of caipiras taught to children in Brazilian schools, who are told to use incorrect grammar and act foolish during the festival.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Anxieties over the changing meaning of the festival also reflect a growing "carnavalization" of the tradition. Rather than an emphasis on religion, the festival is presented as a massive gathering for both Brazilians and tourists with large concerts in major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Packman|first=Jeff|date=Fall 2014|title=The Other Other Festa: June Samba and the Alternative Spaces of Bahia, Brazil’s São João Festival and Industries|jstor=10.5406/blacmusiresej.34.2.0255|journal=Black Music Research Journal|volume=34|pages=255–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Festival of the Bluegrass''', located in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], is the oldest [[bluegrass music]] festival in the [[bluegrass region]] of [[Kentucky]].  The festival takes place the first full weekend of June each year.  The Festival of the Bluegrass helped shape the early bluegrass festival culture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ibma.org/press/archives/festival-bluegrass-celebrates-40-years "Festival of the Bluegrass Celebrates 40 Years"]. ''International Bluegrass Music Association''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cornett family of [[Georgetown, Kentucky]], began the festival in 1974&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kentucky.com/2014/06/06/3278858_festival-of-the-bluegrass-finds.html?rh=1 "Festival of the Bluegrass finds a new friend, partner in BoB"]. By Walter Tunis Contributing Music Writer", ''Kentucky.com'' June 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; with The Festival of the Bluegrass, which was named by [[Raymond McLain, Sr]]. The first festival stage was a farm wagon with a tarp for shelter. The fans also used a tarp as shelter from the terrible thunderstorms the first day of the festival.  This first festival was held on [[Walnut Hall Farm]], part of which is now the [[Kentucky Horse Park]] just on the north side of Lexington.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluegrasstoday.com/festival-of-the-bluegrass-2013/ "Festival of the Bluegrass 2013".] James Gabehart  ''Bluegrass Today'', June 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Later the festival was moved to [[Masterson Station Park]], a Lexington city park, for initially two years. However, the festival did not move back to the Horse Park until the seventeenth year, by which time the Horse Park was fully developed with a suitable campground.  The annual event is a [[traditional bluegrass]] festival dedicated to preserving bluegrass music.

Since 1998, the festival consists of three stages of music and incorporates a music camp designed to teach bluegrass music to school-age children.  In 2007 the festival received the [[International Bluegrass Music Association]]'s Event of the Year award.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 2013, the weekend Festival of the Bluegrass will be following up a weeklong celebration in Lexington, "Best of Bluegrass".&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluegrasstoday.com/festival-of-the-bluegrass-unites-with-bob/ "Festival of the Bluegrass unites with BOB"].

The '''Florida Azalea Festival''' is a two-day event held annually in [[Palatka, Florida]], USA, on the first weekend of March. The festival celebrates the seasonal arrival of the [[azalea]] blossom to the northeast Florida region.

==History==
The first official Florida Azalea Festival was held in 1938. Originating as Jaycees Day, the local chapter of the Jaycees organization transformed the event into the festival celebrated today. In the early years the festival was centered at the [[Ravine Gardens State Park|Ravine Gardens]]. As its popularity grew, most of the activities were moved to the riverfront in [[downtown Palatka]].

The modern event is conducted by the Palatka [[Main Street Programs in the United States|Main Street program]]. The Ravine Gardens still joins in the celebration with what it calls Azalea Days. Its diverse collection and high concentration of the flower makes it a staple for those who want to get a good look at the celebrated annual blooms.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Frederick Emerson Peters''' (September 28, 1885 – July 25, 1959) was an [[United States|American]] [[impostor]] who wrote bad [[cheque|check]]s masquerading as scholars and famous people. In an age before mass communication, few store owners bothered to ID check writers. He was born in [[West Salem, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/41779990/&lt;/ref&gt;

Peters began his career of passing phony checks around 1902 when he presented himself as [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.|Theodore Roosevelt II]], the son of the US president. He used fraudulent checks for his purchases, writing them to round numbers just a couple of dollars above the price of the purchase. Many of the fooled businesses were still impressed and even framed the checks as mementos.

Peters was eventually arrested in 1915 and sentenced to ten years in prison. He took charge of the [[prison library]] and used it to study various subjects to further his plans.

When he was released he took a role of antique expert "R.A. Coleman" of the [[American Peace Society]]. He visited [[antique]] shops ostensibly to buy items for museum collections and again rounded off checks for his "commission". As "J.J. Morton", he bought books for universities.

Over the following years he impersonated real people like [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Booth Tarkington]] and [[Gifford Pinchot II]]. He was also jailed many times but always returned to his old activities later. Further research would be needed to clarify if he was the same Frederick Emerson Peters who on July 2, 1951 became the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives by year, 1951|22nd Ten Most Wanted Fugitive]] listed by the FBI, and who was then arrested by two FBI agents when they recognized him in a Washington, D.C. hotel lobby on January 15, 1952.

When asked why he kept returning to crime, Peters gave a classic response: "It would require the rock-like will of the [[Sphynx]] to resist such temptation." When he was found dead in 1959, he had five checks on his pockets - all of them written for different names. Peters died on July 25, 1959 at a hotel in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] of a cerebral hemorrhage.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/10552598/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gamma Normids (GNO)''' are a weak [[meteor shower]], active from March 7 to 23, peaking on March 15. The [[Radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] is located near the star [[Gamma2 Normae]] in the constellation [[Norma (constellation)|Norma]].

==History==

The first observations were made by R A McIntosh from [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] in 1929, with confirmation coming from observations made by M. Geddes in 1932.&lt;ref name=Kronk /&gt; The shower was virtually ignored until [[radar]] equipment used by A A Weiss in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] detected activity 15–16 March 1953.&lt;ref name=Kronk /&gt; An attempt to observe the shower with radar in 1956 was unsuccessful, however the shower was observed again with radar in 1969.&lt;ref name=Kronk /&gt;

Members of the Western Australia Meteor Section made extensive observations in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1983 the average magnitude of the 63 meteors was 2.68 and 9.5% had trains with the highest [[Zenithal Hourly Rate]] (ZHR) of 9.6±2.3 recorded on the night of March 13/14 . In 1986 273 meteors were observed, and the highest ZHR (3.49) was recorded on March 14/15. Nearly 20% of the meteors left trains.&lt;ref name=Kronk /&gt;

In 2005 the Liga IberoAmericana De Astronomía noted meteors from this stream every night during the observation period of March 8–17. The highest number of meteors seen was 5, on the night of March 10/11 with a ZHR of 14 ± 6.&lt;ref name=Kronk /&gt;

[[Image:Aalborg Kloster, 29 april 2008, billede 9.jpg|thumb|upright|''Aalborg Kloster'']]
The '''Hospital of the Holy Ghost, Aalborg''' ({{lang-da|Helligåndsklostret i Aalborg}}), the buildings of which, although now without any religious function, are still known as '''''Aalborg Kloster''''' (lit. ''Aalborg Monastery''), is a former establishment of the [[Order of the Holy Ghost]] in [[Aalborg]], [[Denmark]]. It was the hospital of Aalborg from 1431 to 1953 and is one of Denmark's best preserved medieval establishments. These are the oldest buildings in north [[Jutland]], and the former hospital is also the oldest social institution in Denmark.

==History==
===Foundation===
The hospital was founded in 1431 by the wealthy Lady Maren Hemmingsdatter with the gift of a large house, adjoining land and an endowment as a "House of the Holy Ghost" ({{lang-da|Helligåndshus}}), common in Denmark at that period, a charitable institution of a religious nature for the care of the sick, old and poor. In 1434 the house burnt down and the present buildings were built to replace it.

===Order of the Holy Ghost===
On 20 August 1451 it formally became a part of the [[Order of the Holy Ghost]], a hospitaller order which had originated in [[Montpellier]], [[France]], with the aim of caring for the sick, the old and orphans. The Aalborg hospital specialised in the care of [[leper]]s. It was a double house, with provision for both male and female religious. It gained high status within the order, the prior in Aalborg being the [[Grand Master (order)|grand master's]] deputy in Scandinavia.

The monastic complex when completed in 1500 consisted of four ranges round a quadrangular garden  with the magnificent church on the south side, and separate wings for the male and female religious. It was constructed in late [[Brick Gothic]] style.

The work of the hospital was paid for with income-producing farms, mills and fishing rights scattered throughout northern Jutland. It even owned its own brick works. The hospital was also authorized to send out "gatherers" who solicited donations of food, cloth, money or goods for the benefit of the sick poor.

===Dissolution and after===
During the [[Reformation in Denmark|Reformation]] in 1536, the Hospital of the Holy Ghost was dissolved. Its important function as a city hospital was still needed, however, and the city just secularized it: most of the religious simply gave up their religious status and continued doing the same work for the poor. Also, the Order of the Holy Ghost made extensive use of lay people in its hospitals, whose status was unaffected. The hospital continued to operate here until 1953.

The church was another matter. After the Reformation, Aalborg had three large churches without religious organisations to provide for their upkeep, and the townspeople did not want the cost of their maintenance. It was therefore decided to demolish the hospital church and the Vor Frue Church, leaving [[St. Budolfi Church]] as the city church. (The tower of the hospital church remained standing until 1880).

For 300 years the [[grammar school]] of Aalborg was also located in the buildings.

During the [[Second World War]], Denmark's first [[resistance group]], the [[Churchill Club]], was established here.

==Present day==
Today the buildings contain a [[retirement]] home with independent apartments for the elderly, as well as meeting and exhibition rooms. There is also a chapel where services are held by clergy from the Budolfi Church, now the cathedral of Aalborg. The present ''Aalborg Kloster'' is directed in its social care functions by a board consisting of the [[Bishop of Aalborg]], a representative of the [[North Jutland Region]], the mayor of Aalborg, the Chief of Police and two other church representatives.

Since Trump's inauguration, Conway has been embroiled in a series of controversies: using the phrase "[[alternative facts]]", making reference to a "[[Bowling Green massacre]]" that never occurred, and claiming that [[Michael Flynn]] had the full confidence of the president hours before he was dismissed. Members of Congress from both parties called for an investigation of an apparent ethics violation after she publicly endorsed commercial products associated with the president's daughter, [[Ivanka Trump]].&lt;ref name=oversight /&gt;

====Ted Cruz support and endorsement====
Despite being acquainted with [[Donald Trump]] for years, stemming from the fact that she lived in [[Trump World Tower]] from 2001 to 2008 and sat on the condo board,&lt;ref name="Lizza"/&gt; Conway initially endorsed [[Ted Cruz]] in the 2016 Republican presidential primary and chaired a pro-Cruz political action committee known as Keep the Promise I, which was almost entirely funded by businessman [[Robert Mercer (businessman)|Robert Mercer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/01/trump-hires-ex-cruz-super-pac-strategist-kellyanne-conway/ "Trump hires ex-Cruz super PAC strategist Kellyanne Conway," by Sean Sullivan, Washington Post, July 1, 2016], retrieved January 12, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/23/politics/donald-trump-super-pac-fundraising/ "Yet another Donald Trump super PAC launches, this one with a link to Ted Cruz," by Theodore Schleifer, CNN, June 23, 2016], retrieved January 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Conway's organization criticized Republican presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] as "extreme" and "not a conservative".&lt;ref name="Trump's campaign manager cashes in"/&gt;&lt;ref name="campbell1"/&gt;  On January 25, 2016, Conway criticized Trump as "a man who seems to be offending his way to the nomination."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollcall.com/news/The-Only-Republicans-Man-Enough-to-Stop-Trump-Are-Women-245582-1.html "The only Republicans man enough to stop Trump are women," by Patricia Murphy, Roll Call, January 25, 2016], retrieved November 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 26, Conway criticized Trump's use of [[eminent domain]], saying "Donald Trump has literally bulldozed over the little guy to get his way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehill.com/homenews/news/267059-republican-rivals-launch-effort-to-villainize-donald-trump "Republican rivals launch effort to villainize Donald Trump,"] ''The Hill'', January 26, 2016.

===Presidential transition===
{{Main|Presidential transition of Donald Trump}}
On November 10, 2016, Conway tweeted publicly that Trump had offered her a [[White House]] job.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/796757702995308548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Kellyanne Conway tweet, November 10, 2016], Retrieved November 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; "I can have any job I want", she said on November 28.&lt;ref name="cnbc.com"&gt;CNBC Staff, [https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/28/trump-furious-over-kellyanne-conway-comments-on-sunday-shows-about-romney-sources.html "Trump furious over Kellyanne Conway comments on Sunday shows about Romney: Sources," CNBC, November 28, 2016], Retrieved November 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 24, Conway tweeted that she was "Receiving deluge of social media &amp; private comms re: [[Mitt Romney|Romney]]. Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state" with a link to an article on Trump loyalists' discontent for the 2012 nominee. Conway told CNN she was only tweeting what she has shared with President-elect [[Donald Trump]] and Vice President-elect [[Mike Pence]] in private.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/politics/kellyanne-conway-romney-tweets/index.html|title=Conway tweets about Trump base anger over Romney|last=LoBionco|first=Tom|date=November 24, 2016|publisher=CNN|access-date=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 28, two top sources at the Trump transition team told media outlets that Trump "was furious" at Conway for media comments she made on Trump administration cabinet appointments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/28/trump-furious-over-kellyanne-conway-comments-on-sunday-shows-about-romney-sources.html "Trump furious over Kellyanne Conway comments on Sunday shows," CNBC, November 28, 2016], Retrieved November 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, however, Trump released a written statement stating that the campaign sources were wrong and that he had expressed disappointment at her critical comments on Romney.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/us/politics/kellyanne-conway-donald-trump.html "Challenging the Boss in Public?

On December 1, Conway appeared with senior aides of the Trump campaign, at [[Harvard]]'s [[Kennedy School of Government]], for a forum on the 2016 presidential race; the quadrennial post-presidential election forum has been held at the School of Government since 1972. Sitting across from Conway were senior Clinton campaign aides, including Clinton's campaign manager [[Robby Mook]]. As tempers began to flare, the forum escalated into a "shouting match"; during one exchange, Clinton senior strategist [[Joel Benenson]] said "The fact of the matter is that more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump." Conway replied to Benenson while looking at the Trump aides: "Hey, guys, we won. You don't have to respond. He was the better candidate. That's why he won."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/shouting-match-erupts-between-clinton-and-trump-aides/2016/12/01/7ac4398e-b7ea-11e6-b8df-600bd9d38a02_story.html|title=Shouting match erupts between Clinton and Trump aides|last=Tumulty|first=Karen|date=December 1, 2016|publisher=Washington Post|access-date=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

=== Inauguration fight ===

According to eyewitnesses, Conway allegedly punched a tuxedo-clad man at an exclusive inauguration ball just hours after [[Donald Trump]] was sworn in as President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2017/01/24/report-kellyanne-conway-punched-man-at-ball-inauguration|title=Witnesses: Kellyanne Conway Punched Man at Inaugural Ball|date=2017-01-24|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/01/trump_adviser_kellyanne_conway_threw_mean_punches.html|title=Kellyanne Conway threw 'mean punches' at Trump inaugural ball, witness says|work=NJ.com|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to break up a scuffle, Conway stepped between two men, but they would not break up the fight, and Conway apparently punched one of them in the face with closed fists at least three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/kellyanne-conway-punch-man-donald-trump-us-presidential-inauguration-ball-witness-president-adviser-a7543061.html|title=Kellyanne Conway 'punched a man at Trump's inauguration ball'|date=2017-01-24|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4150558/Kellyanne-Conway-punched-man-inauguration-ball.html|title=Top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway 'punched a man at inauguration ball'|work=Mail Online|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative facts===

A week later, the conservative daily magazine ''[[American Thinker]]'' argued that the "tidal wave of derision hoisted upon President Trump's senior adviser" had been rather shocking to observe because the derision had been "so spectacularly off base". The magazine asserted that the phrase "alternative facts" was in common use in law and that it was known to most lawyers, including Conway, with her George Washington University Law School degree, adding that, "it seems eminently possible that Ms. Conway knew exactly what it was she was saying." After giving examples of legal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |publisher=Mondaq Business Briefing |date=May 2003 |title=Statements of Truth - Alternative Facts.(Clarke v Marlborough Fine Art (London) Limited and Marlborough International Fine Art Establishment) |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-102965188.html}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-legal uses of the phrase "alternative facts", the article contended that when Chuck Todd upbraided Kellyanne Conway with the claim that "alternative facts are not facts; they're falsehoods", he was not only wrong, but "propagating an ignorance born out of lazy and shallow thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allison|first1=David|title='Alternative facts': A common legal term|url=http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2017/02/alternative_facts_a_common_legal_term.html|website=American Thinker|accessdate=February 12, 2017|date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2017, Conway appeared in a [[News program|television news show]] interview on ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]''. In order to justify [[January 2017 immigration ban|President Trump's immigration ban]], she referenced an event allegedly perpetrated by Iraqi terrorists she termed the "[[Bowling Green massacre]]".

On February 5, 2017, [[New York University]] journalism professor [[Jay Rosen]] argued that, given repeated misstatements of fact, Conway should cease being booked as a guest on television news shows. [[CNN]] opted not to book Conway as a guest that day because of what the network said were "serious questions about her credibility."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/business/the-massacre-that-wasnt-and-a-turning-point-for-fake-news.html "The massacre that wasn't, and a turning point for 'fake news',"] ''The New York Times'', February 5, 2017, retrieved February 7, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engel, Pamela, [http://www.businessinsider.com/cnn-sean-spicer-kellyanne-conway-credibility-2017-2 "CNN fires back at Sean Spicer: We have not 'walked back' comments on Kellyanne Conway's credibility,] ''Business Insider'', February 7, 2017, retrieved February 7, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics violation allegations and investigation===

On February 9, 2017, during an appearance on ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]]'', Conway discussed department store [[Nordstrom]]'s decision to drop products supplied by [[Ivanka Trump]]'s business. "Go buy Ivanka's stuff is what I would tell you", said Conway; she elaborated "It's a wonderful line. I own some of it. I'm going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody.

===Ban from ''Morning Joe''===

On February 15, 2017, one national news show, ''[[Morning Joe]]'' on [[MSNBC]], banned her from future appearances. "We know for a fact that she tries to book herself on this show. I won't do it. Because I don't believe in fake news, or information that is not true... every time I've ever seen her on television, something's askew, off or incorrect", the show's co-host [[Mika Brzezinski]] said.&lt;ref name=morningjoe&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/morning-joe-bans-trump-aide-kellyanne-conway-article-1.2973225 "'Morning Joe' bans Trump aide Kellyanne Conway: She's not credible anymore",] ''New York Daily News'', February 15, 2017, retrieved February 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The show's primary host [[Joe Scarborough]] said the decision to ban Conway from future appearances was based on her being "out of the loop" and "in none of the key meetings". "She's not briefed. She's just saying things just to get in front of the TV to prove her relevance", he said.&lt;ref name=morningjoe/&gt;

On February 15, 2017, ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' columnist [[Jennifer Rubin (journalist)|Jennifer Rubin]] agreed that Conway should be banned from future television appearances. "In recent days, [[George Stephanopoulos]] and [[Matt Lauer]] blasted her directly, essentially calling her a [[fable|fabulist]]. Given all that, it would be irresponsible for any news show to put her out there, suggesting she really does not know what is going on at any given moment", Rubin wrote.&lt;ref name=ignoringconway&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/02/15/can-we-start-ignoring-whatever-conway-and-spicer-say/ "Can we start ignoring whatever Conway and Spicer say?"] by Jennifer Rubin, ''The Washington Post'', February 15, 2017, retrieved February 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55800">Many '''legal assessments of the [[Gaza flotilla raid]]''' were published subsequent to the event. International law experts (and non-lawyers) differed over the legality of the action by Israel. Most agree that Israel is entitled to impose and enforce a naval blockade, that Israel can intercept a ship in international waters headed for a belligerent territory, that Israel may use force when intercepting such ships, and that there must be a proportional relationship between the threat and response.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The force necessary to respond to violent resistance and whether the force that was used was proportionate were disputed.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/01/AR2010060102934.html |title=Israel's flotilla raid revives questions of international law|author=Colum Lynch|publisher=The Washington Post |date=June 1, 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |quote=scholars on both sides of the debate agree that Israel is required by law to respond with the proportional use of force in the face of violent resistance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/afua-hirsch-law-blog/2010/jun/01/gaza-freedom-flotilla-international-law |title=Was the Gaza Flotilla Raid Illegal? |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media |accessdate=June 2, 2010 | location=London | date=June 1, 2010 | first=Afua | last=Hirsch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately one year after the event, the UN investigative committee for the 2010 Flotilla to Gaza concluded that (1) the blockade was legal, based on the principle of [[Right of self-defense|self-defense]], (2) Israel was "justified in stopping vessels even outside its territorial waters," (3) Israel's decision to board the vessels with such force was "excessive," (4) Israeli forces "faced significant, organized and violent resistance from a group of passengers" that required them to use force for their [[self-defense|own protection]], and (5) the loss of nine lives was "unacceptable."&lt;ref name=telegraph-20110707&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/8623491/Israel-sea-blockade-of-Gaza-legal-but-attack-on-Mavi-Marmara-was-excessive.html |title=Israel sea blockade of Gaza legal, but attack on Mavi Marmara was 'excessive' |author=Mark Weiss |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/middle-east/israel-and-palestine/110901/israel-excessive-force-gaza-flotilla]&lt;/ref&gt; It recommended that Israel immediately report its use of force to the United Nations Security Council for resolution as specified in [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]].

Some, such as law experts Harvard Law School Professor [[Alan Dershowitz]], Chicago Law School Professor [[Eric Posner]], and Johns Hopkins International Law and Diplomacy Professor [[Ruth Wedgwood]], said that the naval [[blockade]], the boarding in international waters, and the use of force were in accord with long-standing international law.&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Dershowitz compared the blockade with the U.S. blockade of Cuba during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and Posner with the Coalition blockade of Iraq during the first [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], the [[National Lawyers Guild]]'s International Committee, [[Istanbul Bilgi University]]'s Law Department Dean Turgut Tarhanlı and other experts have concluded that the blockade was itself illegal, or agreed with [[University of Dundee]] international law professor Robin Churchill that the boarding on the [[high seas]] was illegal even if the blockade were lawful, or agreed with international law professor Said Mahmoudi that the use of force was disproportionate and the raid was therefore illegal even if the blockade and the boarding in international waters were lawful.&lt;ref name="NLGIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlginternational.org/news/article.php?nid=313|title=Israel's Security Cannot Come at Any Price - Legal Analysis of Flotilla Attack|author=[[Ben Saul]]|accessdate=June 10, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727124854/http://www.nlginternational.org/news/article.php?nid=313|archivedate=July 27, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adrcenter1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adrcenter.com/international/Conference_Program-EN.pdf |title=Conference Program |format=PDF |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="teibel1"&gt;{{cite news

The issue of possible violation of international law was discussed at the [[UN Security Council]]. The United States blocked a draft resolution [[criticism of Israel|criticizing Israel]] proposed by Turkey, the Palestinians, and Arab nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/01/israel-investigation-attack-gaza-flotilla-us |title=Israel should lead investigation into attack on Gaza flotilla, says US |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media |accessdate=June 2, 2010 | location=London | date=June 1, 2010 | first=Chris | last=McGreal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality of blockade==

===Arguments opposing legality of blockade===
The [[United Nations Charter]] requires that nations avoid the use of force when settling external conflicts, and that human rights be respected with regards to internal conflicts. Nations which use force in self-defense are required to immediately report these measures to the United Nations Security Council so that it can fulfill its role of ensuring peace. 

The [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], [[Navanethem Pillay]], has condemned Israel's blockade of Gaza on numerous occasions, calling it "a direct contravention of international human rights and humanitarian law. It must end now”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps//news/story.asp?NewsID=28983&amp;Cr=palestin&amp;Cr1= |title=UN human rights chief calls for end to Israeli blockade of Gaza Strip |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Ynet news|title=UN's Pillay: Gaza blockade illegal, must be lifted|date=June 5, 2010|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3899265,00.html|accessdate=June 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict" in its [[Goldstone Report]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1733. The Mission ... considers that the series of acts that deprive Palestinians in the Gaza Strip of their means of subsistence, employment, housing and water, that deny their freedom of movement and their right to leave and enter their own country, that limit their rights to access a court of law and an effective remedy, could lead a competent court to find that the crime of persecution, a crime against humanity, has been committed.&lt;ref&gt;OHCHR: [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/FactFindingMission.htm Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607053232/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/FactFindingMission.htm |date=2009-06-07 }} (Paragraph 1733)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Hamburg.IntSeegerichtshof.Elbseite.wmt.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The International Tribunal for the Sea in Hamburg, Germany|The [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]], in Hamburg, Germany, was established by the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]]]]

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] said that Israel's blockade violated the [[Geneva Conventions]] and stated that it constituted a collective punishment imposed in clear violation of Israel's obligations under international humanitarian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kershner|first1=Isabel|last2=Akram|first2=Fares|journal=New York Times|title=Israel Backs Panel to Examine Raid|date=June 13, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/14/world/middleeast/14mideast.html|accessdate=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OHCHR: [http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/palestine-update-140610 Gaza closure: not another year! ICRC 14-06-2010 News release 10/103]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Turgut Tarhanlı, dean of the [[Istanbul Bilgi University]]'s Law Department,&lt;ref name="adrcenter1"/&gt; cited the concept of [[innocent passage]], under which vessels are granted safe passage through territorial waters in a manner which is not "prejudicial to the peace, good order or the security" of the state. He said that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-211726-jurists-israeli-flotilla-assault-violation-of-international-law.html|title=Jurists: Israeli flotilla assault violation of international law|date=June 1, 2010|work=[[Today's Zaman]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604001812/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-211726-jurists-israeli-flotilla-assault-violation-of-international-law.html|archivedate=June 4, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;the Convention on the Law of the Sea stipulates that a coastal state may consider intervention if a ship is engaged in arms and drug smuggling, the slave trade or terrorist activities. However, the case with the aid boats is totally different. They set sail in accordance with the Customs Act and are known to be carrying humanitarian aid, not weapons or ammunition. According to the Convention on the Law of the Sea, Israel was not entitled to launch a military operation against the boats and activists.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With regard to the [[Gaza–Jericho Agreement]], [[Diana Buttu]], a Palestinian-Canadian lawyer and former spokesperson for the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], said that Israel declared the [[Oslo Accords]] dead in 2001, and actually breached the agreements, so that a call to the applicability of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement is not plausible.&lt;ref name="gaza-jericho" /&gt;

Douglas Guilfoyle, a lecturer at University College of London since 2007 who authored Shipping Interdiction and the Law of the Sea in 2009, told [[Aljazeera]] that, while a blockade is a recognized tool of warfare, a close look should be taken as to whether there was proper notification of the Gaza blockade, and whether it inflicted "excessive damage to the civilian population in relation to the concrete military advantage expected".&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2010/06/201063114723151689.html |title=Is Israel's blockade legal? - Focus |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=June 3, 2010 |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amnesty International]], in a report dated June 1, 2010, included the opinion that "As a form of collective punishment, Israel’s continuing blockade of Gaza is a flagrant violation of international law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/suffocating-gaza-israeli-blockades-effects-palestinians-2010-06-01 |title=Suffocating Gaza - the Israeli blockade's effects on Palestinians, Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Parliament, in a June 14, 2010 resolution, called the Gaza blockade "collective punishment in contravention of international humanitarian law" and demanded its immediate cessation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/focus_page/008-75601-158-06-24-901-20100607FCS75591-07-06-2010-2010/default_p001c017_en.htm |title=Plenary Session 14–17 June |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=MOTION&amp;reference=B7-2010-0389&amp;language=EN |title=Motion for a resolution on Israeli military operation against the humanitarian flotilla and the Gaza blockade - B7-0389/2010 |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments supporting legality of blockade===
[[File:Soviet b-59 submarine.jpg|thumb|left|190px|alt=Soviet submarine and U.S. Navy - Blockade Cuban Missile Crisis|Soviet submarine forced to surface by U.S. Navy, in Caribbean near Cuba, during [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] blockade]]
[[Alan Dershowitz]], professor of Law at [[Harvard Law School]], wrote that the legality of blockades as a response to acts of war “is not subject to serious doubt.”&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dershowitz |first=Alan |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/06/02/2010-06-02_israel_obeyed_international_law_legally_the_gaza_flotilla_conflict_is_an_openand.html |title=Israel obeyed international law: Legally, the Gaza flotilla conflict is an open-and-shut case |publisher=[[New York Daily News]]|date= June 1, 2010|accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He likened Israel’s maritime blockade of Gaza to U.S. naval actions in Cuba during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], which the U.S. had deemed lawful though not part of an armed conflict.&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"/&gt;

Similarly, [[Allen Weiner]], former [[U.S. State Department]] attorney and legal counselor at the American Embassy in [[The Hague]], and now a [[Stanford Law School]] professor, said "the Israeli blockade itself against Gaza itself is not illegal".&lt;ref name="washingtonpost2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/01/AR2010060102934.html?hpid=topnews |title=Israel's flotilla raid revives questions of international law |publisher=The Washington Post|date= June 1, 2010|accessdate=June 2, 2010 | first=Colum | last=Lynch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ruth Wedgwood]], a professor of International Law and Diplomacy at the [[School of Advanced International Studies]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]], said that under the [[law of armed conflict]], which would be in effect given Hamas's rocket attacks on Israel and Israel's responses, Israel has "a right to prevent even neutrals from shipping arms to [Hamas]".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

[[File:Scott-anaconda.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Blockade in American Civil War|Cartoon map of [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] blockade of [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during [[U.S. Civil War]]]]
[[Eric Posner]], international law professor at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], noting that the raid had "led to wild accusations of illegality", wrote that blockades are lawful during times of armed conflict (such as the [[Coalition of Gulf War|Coalition]] blockade of Iraq during the first [[Gulf War]]), and that "war-like conditions certainly exist between Israel and Hamas".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Posner |first=Eric |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704025304575284210429984110|title= The Gaza Blockade and International Law: Israel's position is reasonable and backed by precedent|work=Opinion|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|subscription=yes |date= June 4, 2010|accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He compared Israel's blockade to the [[Union blockade]] by the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] against the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] (a non-state) during the [[U.S. Civil War]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] later affirmed the legitimacy of that blockade.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Philip Roche, a partner in the shipping disputes and risk management team with the London-headquartered international law firm [[Norton Rose]], also said: "On the basis that Hamas is the ruling entity of Gaza, and Israel is in the midst of an armed struggle against that ruling entity, the blockade is legal."&lt;ref name="is-blockade-legal"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65133D20100602|title=Q&amp;A: Is Israel's naval blockade of Gaza legal?|publisher=Reuters|date={{date|2010-06-02}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The basis for that is the law of blockade, derived from international law that was codified in the 1909 [[London Declaration concerning the Laws of Naval War]], and which was then updated in 1994 in the [[San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea]]--"a legally recognized document".&lt;ref name="is-blockade-legal" /&gt;  He addressed the charge by Human Rights Watch that the blockade of a terrorist organization constitutes a collective penalty against civilians, ostensibly violating Article 33 of the fourth Geneva Convention, by saying "This argument won't stand up. Blockades and other forms of economic sanctions are permitted in international law, which necessarily means that civilians will suffer through no fault of their own."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

International law Professor [[Ed Morgan (professor)|Ed Morgan]] of the [[University of Toronto]], likewise, noting that it is clear that Israel and Hamas are in a state of armed conflict, which has been noted by the General Assembly to the Human Rights Council in its Goldstone Report, wrote that a blockade of an enemy’s coast is an established military tactic.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Canada |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/israels-naval-blockade-pitches-and-rolls-with-the-law-of-the-sea/article1589981/ |title=Israel’s naval blockade pitches and rolls with the Law of the Sea |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=May 31, 2010 |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He pointed out that it is recognized as a means at the [[Security Council]]’s disposal under Article 42 of the UN Charter, and is similarly set forth in Article 539 of the Canadian Forces manual Counter-Insurgency Operations.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"/&gt; [[Image:Bill Clinton, Yitzhak Rabin, Yasser Arafat at the White House 1993-09-13.jpg|left|190px|thumb|alt=Oslo Accords 1993, hands shaking|[[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[Bill Clinton]], and [[Yasser Arafat]] at the [[Oslo Accords]] signing ceremony in 1993]] He wrote:  &lt;blockquote&gt;Having announced its blockade, Israel had no obligation to take the ships’ crew at their word as to the nature of the cargo.  The blockading party has the right to fashion the arrangements, including search at a nearby port, under which passage of humanitarian goods is permitted.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

U.S. Vice President [[Joe Biden]] said "Israel has a right to know – they're at war with Hamas – has a right to know whether or not arms are being smuggled in.  It's legitimate for Israel to say, 'I don't know what's on that ship. These guys are dropping ... 3,000 rockets on my people.'"&lt;ref name="sfgate1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/06/04/MNCB1DP01I.DTL |title=Israel's Gaza blockade legal, many scholars say |publisher=Sfgate.com |date= June 5, 2010|accessdate=June 6, 2010 | first=Bob | last=Egelko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbas Al Lawati, a Dubai-based ''[[Gulf News]]'' journalist on board the flotilla, opined that Israel is likely to cite the [[Gaza–Jericho Agreement]] (Annex I, Article XI) which vests Israel with the responsibility for security along the coastline and the Sea of Gaza.&lt;ref name="gaza-jericho"&gt;{{cite news|last=Al Lawati|first=Abbas|publisher= [[Gulf News]]|title=Q&amp;A: Freedom Flotilla project in aid of Gaza|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/region/palestinian-territories/q-a-freedom-flotilla-project-in-aid-of-gaza-1.631381|accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement stipulates that Israel may take any measures necessary against vessels suspected of being used for terrorist activities or for smuggling arms, ammunition, drugs, goods, or for any other illegal activity.&lt;ref name=Gaza-Jericho&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/peace/guide/pages/gaza-jericho%20agremeent%20annex%20i.aspx |title=Gaza-Jericho Agreement Annex I |accessdate={{date|2015-03-27}}|publisher=Israeli Foreign Ministry|date={{date|1994-05-04}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Wedgwood opined that the goal of the flotilla was to:  "denude Israel of what it thinks it was guaranteed in the 1993 [[Oslo Accords]] which preceded the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, which is the control of the external borders of Gaza and West Bank....  The problem ... is that you could easily have a rearming of Hamas, which caused a terrible conflict."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

José María Ruiz Soroa, a Spanish maritime law scholar and co-author of the legal commentary ''Manual de derecho de la navegación marítima'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFnfAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=manual+de+derecho+de+la+navegaci%C3%B3n+mar%C3%ADtima&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TfR5Ur-5FciSkQeI3YDQCw&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Manual de derecho de la navegación marítima (3ª ed.)|language=Spanish |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that Israel is not entitled according to international law to constrain the freedom of navigation of any ship on the high seas, except in a number of situations that do not apply to the Gaza flotilla case.  He said blockade is not a valid reason, as it is a concept only applicable to war situations. He also said that Israel's action is a breach of the UN [[International Maritime Organization]] [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation]] (SUA),&lt;ref name=admiraltylawguide&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/suppression1988.html |title=Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation |publisher=admiraltylawguide.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which entered into force for Israel in April 2009. He said that according to the article 6.1 of the SUA, the jurisdiction over the offences that a ship might have committed lies in the state whose flag the ship is flying.&lt;ref group="text"&gt;{{cite news |title=Un ilícito internacional|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/ilicito/internacional/elpepuint/20100602elpepiint_8/Tes|accessdate=June 2, 2010|newspaper=[[El País]]|language=Spanish |quote=La actuación de las Fuerzas Armadas israelíes al tomar por la fuerza el control de buques mercantes de otra bandera en alta mar [..] y al causar la muerte violenta a varios de sus tripulantes, viola patentemente el Derecho Internacional [..].

In 1988 it was agreed ... the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA) that ... typifies as a crime taking control of a ship by force, or exerting violence over shipped persons, for whatever private or public reason, for whatever economic or terrorist interests....

According to [[George Bisharat]], a professor at [[Hastings College of the Law]], Israel's blockade of Gaza was illegal, and enforcing the blockade in international waters was similarly illegal. Bisharat wrote that "flotilla passengers were entitled to defend themselves against Israel's forcible boarding of the Mavi Marmara, whether or not Israeli commandos fired immediately on landing on the ship's deck".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=George Bisharat |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/06/03/EDGF1DPDK9.DTL#ixzz0puW6Bdk9 |title=Gaza occupation and siege are illegal |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle - Sfgate.com |date=2010-06-04 |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey's foreign minister [[Ahmet Davutoğlu]] said: &lt;blockquote&gt;High-seas freedom, freedom of navigation, was one of the oldest forms of international law; no vessel could be stopped or boarded without the consent of the captain or flag State.  Any suspected violation of the law did not absolve the intervening State under international law.  To treat humanitarian delivery as a hostile act and to treat aid workers as combatants could not be deemed legal or legitimate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Canadian scholar [[Michael Byers (Canadian author)|Michael Byers]] said that the event would only be legal if the Israeli boarding were necessary and proportionate for the country's self-defence. Byers believed that "the action does not appear to have been necessary in that the threat was not imminent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In a legal analysis published by the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', a staff expert on international law said that countries are not allowed to extend their sovereignty on areas outside their coastal waters.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|author=Von Reinhard Müller |url=http://www.faz.net/s/RubB30ABD11B91F41C0BF2722C308D40318/Doc~E5237CD1680B143708A8E91DACB267CF5~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html |title=Israels Militäraktion: Auf Hoher See darf kein Zwang ausgeübt werden |publisher=''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]' |language=German |date=June 1, 2010 |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In international waters, if there is reasonable suspicion of piracy or human trafficking, a country has the right to access foreign ships. If the suspicion remains, it can search the ship.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

[[File:Zonmar-en.svg|thumb|left|165px|alt=International waters zones|[[International waters]]]]
[[Richard Falk]], former professor of international law at [[Princeton University]] and U.N. human rights investigator in the Palestinian territories said that the “ships that were situated in the high seas where freedom of navigation exists, according to the law of the seas” and called for those responsible to "be held criminally accountable for their wrongful acts".&lt;ref name="sfgate1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34863&amp;Cr=gaza&amp;Cr1 |title=United Nations: Secretary-General 'shocked' by deadly raid on Gaza aid flotilla |publisher=Un.org |date=May 31, 2010 |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Original Geneva Conventions.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The 1864 First Geneva Convention|The 1864 [[First Geneva Convention]]]]
Jason Alderwick, a maritime analyst at the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] of London, said that the Israeli raid did not appear to have been conducted lawfully under the convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article7141520.ece How the flotilla bound for Gaza Strip sailed into death at sea]. ''[[The Times]]'', UK. June 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Anthony D'Amato, international law professor at [[Northwestern University School of Law]], argued that the San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea applies to a situation in which the laws of war between states are in force. He said the laws of war do not apply in the conflict between Israel and Hamas, which isn't even a state. He said the law of the [[Geneva Conventions]] would apply.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;

Linda Brayer, an Israeli human rights lawyer who specialized in the laws of war and international law, concludes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It follows, therefore, that Israel was first of all not allowed to attack these vessels militarily, and then not to board these vessels by force, capture these vessels, attack the passengers, imprison them on the vessels, forcibly remove them from the vessels, and steal their private property in the form of cameras, computers, clothes, etc.&lt;ref name="lindabrayer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washington-report.org/component/content/article/9667.html |title=WRMEA – Why Israel’s flotilla attack was illegal, Linda Brayer |publisher=Washington-report.org |date=2010-05-31 |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Arguments supporting legality of high seas enforcement===
The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israeli Foreign Ministry]] argued that the flotilla's interception was lawful, as Israel had publicly declared its blockade, and had given the ships prior notification, and that activists had made it clear by written and oral statements that they intended to violate the blockade. It further argued that international law allowed a state to enforce a naval blockade in international waters, so long as the blockade did not impede access to the ports or coasts of neutral states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Law/Legal+Issues+and+Rulings/Gaza_flotilla_maritime_blockade_Gaza-Legal_background_31-May-2010.htm The Gaza flotilla and the maritime blockade of Gaza - Legal background 31-May-2010&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several legal experts{{Who|date=August 2010}} say, under the law of a blockade, intercepting a vessel could apply globally so long as a ship is bound for a "belligerent" territory.&lt;ref name="is-blockade-legal"/&gt;

[[Alan Dershowitz]] said that action taken in international waters is permissible if a legal blockade is in effect, and if there is no doubt that the offending ships have made a firm determination to break the blockade.&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"/&gt;  "It's okay for Israeli ships to operate in international waters to enforce [the blockade]," said [[Allen Weiner]].&lt;ref name="sfgate1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost2"/&gt; Guilfoyle told Aljazeera that if the blockade was legal, "then yes, a ship could have been intercepted on the high seas, if there was a suspicion it was attempting to breach the blockade."&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"/&gt;

[[File:Nato Ships.jpg|thumb|left|alt=NATO and U.S. ships enforcing the [[Operation Sharp Guard]] blockade|NATO and U.S. ships enforcing the [[Operation Sharp Guard]] blockade]]
[[Ruth Wedgwood]], similarly, said that "the right of visit and search under the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|law of the sea]], or under the law of armed conflict, can be conducted on the high seas".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/jan-june10/gaza2_06-02.html |title=As Flotilla Inquiry Calls Grow Louder, Legality of Gaza Blockade Examined |publisher=[[PBS NewsHour]]|date=June 2, 2010 |accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She pointed out that the U.S. itself, as a neutral throughout most of the 1800s, submitted its ships to inspections on the high seas to allow belligerents to make sure that its cargoes weren't actually fueling any of the European wars.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  She also noted that the U.S. itself blockaded Cuba during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and also commented that in the wars in Yugoslavia, the U.N. itself, and NATO, through [[Operation Sharp Guard]], imposed a blockade on shipments to Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  Roche also indicated that under the law of a blockade, a ship can be intercepted on the high seas as long as it is bound for the blockaded territory.&lt;ref name="is-blockade-legal" /&gt;  Professor Posner, as well, wrote that "longstanding customary international law permits states to enforce publicly announced blockades on the high seas".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  Professor Morgan also said that under the San Remo law, a blockade is often enforced in what would otherwise be international waters.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"/&gt;

[[Mark Regev]], spokesman for the [[Prime Minister of Israel]], referring to the [[San Remo Manual]] on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea, said:&lt;blockquote&gt;The San Remo memorandum states, specifically 67A, that if you have a boat that is charging a blockaded area you are allowed to intercept even prior to it reaching the blockaded area if you've warned them in advance, and that we did a number of times, and they had a stated goal which they openly expressed, of breaking the blockade. That blockade is in place to protect our people.&lt;ref name=sanremoicrc&gt;''The 1994 San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea'', by Louise Doswald-Beck, can be found here [http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JMST] and also in the ''[[International Review of the Red Cross]]'', no. 309, pp.583–594&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC-Lateline&gt;{{cite web

==Use of force==

===Positions that use of force was illegal===

A [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] fact-finding mission was charged by the UN to undertake an investigation of the IDF raid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=10369&amp;LangID=E|publisher=OHCHR Media Centre|title=UN Fact-finding Mission report on Gaza flotilla - Press Conference}}, 23 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In its September 2010 report the UN panel found that the IDF broke international law, and that there was evidence sufficient to initiate prosecutions for breaches of the [[Geneva Convention]]. In particular, the panel, after interviewing more than 100 witnesses, found clear evidence for prosecution for the war crimes of "wilful killing; torture or inhuman treatment; wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health" under Article 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11393836|title=Israeli raid on Gaza aid flotilla broke law - UN probe|date=22 September 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report stated that:
:"The conduct of the Israeli military and other personnel towards the flotilla passengers was not only disproportionate to the occasion but demonstrated levels of totally unnecessary and incredible violence.”&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

The UNHRC fact-finding mission also determined based on both "forensic and firearm evidence" that [[Furkan Dogan]], a 19-year-old [[American citizen]] of Turkish descent, and five Turkish citizens were killed execution-style on May 31 on the [[MV Mavi Marmara|MV ''Mavi Marmara'']] by the Israeli commandos. The report of the fact-finding mission stated that the killing of Dogan and the five Turks by the Israeli commandos "can be characterized as extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions."&lt;ref&gt;Truthout, 2010 Sept. 27, "UN Fact-Finding Mission Says Israelis "Executed" US Citizen Furkan Dogan," http://www.truth-out.org/un-fact-finding-mission-says-israelis-executed-us-citizen-furkan-dogan63609 citing: Human Rights Council, Fifteenth session, "Report of the international fact-finding mission to investigate violations of international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law, resulting from the Israeli attacks on the flotilla of ships carrying humanitarian assistance," http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/15session/A.HRC.15.21_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A legal analysis published by the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'' said that Israeli soldiers had the right to defend themselves,&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; but if Israel used force against the ships without legal justification, the crew members had the right to defend themselves.&lt;ref name="FAZ Auf Hoher See" group="text"&gt;{{cite news|last=Müller|first=Reinhard|journal=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|title=Auf Hoher See darf kein Zwang ausgeübt werden|date=June 2, 2010|url=http://www.faz.net/s/RubB30ABD11B91F41C0BF2722C308D40318/Doc~E5237CD1680B143708A8E91DACB267CF5~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html|accessdate=June 2, 2010|quote=Den Staaten ist es völkerrechtlich nicht erlaubt, die Hohe See ihrer Souveränität zu unterstellen....

Es gibt auch ein Recht, fremde Schiffe zu betreten. Das setzt aber etwa voraus, dass ein begründeter Verdacht der Seeräuberei oder des Sklavenhandels besteht – oder dass vermutet werden muss, dass das fremde Schiff keine Staatszugehörigkeit besitzt. ... Nicht in Zweifel steht, dass sich israelische Soldaten gegen Angriffe zur Wehr setzen dürfen. Hat Israel allerdings ohne rechtlichen Grund Gewalt gegen die Schiffe eingesetzt, so durften sich deren Besatzungsmitglieder zur Wehr setzen.}} Translation: "Countries are not allowed by international laws to extend their sovereignty on international waters. ... In an area that is called the contiguous zone, which extends {{convert|24|nmi|km}} from the coast of the country, states have the right to inspection – especially to ensure the application of immigration and public health laws and regulations.... There also exists a right to access foreign ships. This, however, presupposes that there is a well-founded suspicion of piracy or human trafficking – or that it must be suspected that the foreign ship is not registered in any country.... There is no doubt that Israeli soldiers have the right to defend themselves against attacks. If Israel has used force against the ships without legal justification, however, the members of the crew had the right to defend themselves."&lt;/ref&gt;  Said Mahmoudi, an international law professor, said that boarding a ship on international waters, killing and capturing civilians is not in line with the law.&lt;ref name="Karoline Hoppe"/&gt;

Minister Davutoğlu called the raid "a grave breach of international law and constituted banditry and piracy - it was "murder" conducted by a State, without justification."  Prominent Turkish jurists characterized Israel's actions as a violation of international law and a "war crime."  Turkey's deputy parliament speaker, [[Uğur Mumcu#Family|Guldal Mumcu]], said in a declaration that "[t]his attack was an open violation of United Nations rules and international law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=June 2, 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/02/israel-deport-gaza-flotilla-activists |title=Israel to deport remaining Gaza flotilla activists |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=June 2, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positions that use of force was lawful===
As to the use of force when boarding a ship in such circumstances, it is legal but must be proportionate, according to Commander James Kraska, professor of international law at the [[U.S. Naval War College]], and Professor Morgan.&lt;ref name="is-blockade-legal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"/&gt;  Proportional force does not mean that guns cannot be used by forces when being attacked with knives, but "there has got to be a relationship between the threat and response," said Kraska.&lt;ref name="is-blockade-legal" /&gt; According to J. Peter Pham, a strategic adviser to U.S. and European governments, "from what is known now, it appears that Israel acted within its legal rights."&lt;ref name="is-blockade-legal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"/&gt;

Professor Posner noted that the "1990 UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force &amp; Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials" is not international law, but rather akin to vague  "best practices" for advising countries with poorly trained police forces, and does not apply to a military operation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  He wrote further:  &lt;blockquote&gt;Military operations must respect the principle of proportionality, which is a fuzzy, "know-it-when-you-see-it" test. But one thing is clear. Ships that run blockades may be attacked and sunk under international law. If Israel had exercised that right, far more than nine people would have been killed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Israeli authorities said marines who boarded the vessel opened fire in self-defense after activists clubbed and stabbed them and snatched some of their weapons.&lt;ref name="is-blockade-legal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfgate1"/&gt;

==Seizure of vessels and crew==

===Positions that the seizure of vessels and crew was illegal===

The [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law]], cited in a United Nations report on the raid which concluded that the blockade had been a legitimate and legally implemented response to an act of aggression, states that "The neutral flag covers enemy's goods, with the exception of contraband of war". As ships of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla were using neutral flags, the internationally accepted restrictions on a blockade did not allow for the seizure of the humanitarian aid on the ships, the ships themselves, or their crew, regardless of the legality of the blockade itself. These rules were conceived in an age where inspection for contraband necessarily had to take place at sea, and do not stipulate that ships must alter their course to visit a port of a blockading nation.

While the [[Gaza–Jericho Agreement]] grants the Israel Navy the authority to take action against "vessels suspected of being used for terrorist activities or for smuggling arms, ammunition, drugs, goods, or for any other illegal activity", there is no evidence the Gaza Freedom Flotilla was violating any laws.&lt;ref name="Gaza-Jericho" /&gt; An agreement between Palestine and Israel does not affect the rights of neutral vessels on the high seas under international law.

As Israel is not a party to the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], there are no international agreements restricting the ability for Palestine to unilaterally exit from the Gaza-Jericho Agreement. While Palestine has acceded to the convention, it does not govern treaties that came into force prior to accession or ratification of the convention itself. Treaties that were entered into due to the threat or use of force, or by rogue government elements, are not bound by the terms of the convention. The Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories at the time the Gaza-Jericho Agreement was made, as a result of previous wars, along with the restrictions on civilians in those territories, suggests that both parties did not have equal status during its negotiation. The support of the governing authority in the Gaza Strip for the captured crew of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla shows that it does not view the restrictions on fishing and commerce to be to its benefit.

===Positions that the seizure of vessels and crew was legal===

==Piracy==
Under international law, the Israeli raid was considered state action and not piracy. Commander James Kraska said, "Whether what Israel did is right or wrong, it is not an act of piracy. Piracy deals with private conduct particularly with a pecuniary or financial interest."&lt;ref name="is-blockade-legal"/&gt;

Professor Morgan says that to describe Israeli actions in this case as "piracy" is "inapt since, under both customary law and Article 101 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, that applies only to acts done for private gain."&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"/&gt; Nevertheless, some have used the word to denounce the incident.

==Israeli Supreme Court decisions==
[[File:Dorit Beinisch.JPG|thumb|right|170px|alt=Israel Supreme Court President Dorit Beinisch|[[Israel Supreme Court]] President [[Dorit Beinisch]]]]
The [[Israeli Supreme Court]] rejected six petitions, from both leftist groups and rightist groups, against the IDF and Israel in regard to the raid "in the absence of just cause to intervene in the decision of the attorney general."&lt;ref name="jpost1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=177365 |title=Court dismisses flotilla petitions |publisher=Jpost.com |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ynetnews2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3898429,00.html |title=High Court rejects flotilla suits: Soldiers defended their lives - Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=June 20, 1995 |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supreme Court President [[Dorit Beinish]] wrote in the Court's decision that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The soldiers were forced to respond in order to defend their lives. Unfortunately, the action ended, as was not to be expected, with the loss of lives.  Nine people were killed, and soldiers and flotilla participants were wounded.... the soldiers encountered a harsh and violent response.... The soldiers were attacked with knives, clubs, and metal rods. Attempts were made to snatch their personal weapons and to violently injure them. One of the soldiers was even dropped over the side of the ship.&lt;ref name="jpost1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ynetnews2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court defended the decision to prevent the ships from reaching Gaza:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In light of Hamas' control of the Gaza Strip, Israel has take various steps meant to prevent direct access to the Gaza Strip, including the imposition of a naval blockade on the Strip, which, according to the State's declaration, is meant to block the infiltration of weapons and ammunition into Hamas ranks which have carried out shooting and terrorist attacks in Israeli territory for years with the goal of harming civilians.... Among other things, the State offered the flotilla's organizers to unload the cargo carried on the ship and to transfer the shipment ... via Israel. This offer was rejected.&lt;ref name="ynetnews2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court rejected petitions by right wingers (the Shurat HaDin Israel Law Center and the Almagor Terrorist Victims Association) to prevent the release and deportation of activists who attacked the IDF soldiers pending an investigation.&lt;ref name="ynetnews1"/&gt;  The Court supported the attorney general's decision to release the activists, noting that:  &lt;blockquote&gt;After considering the fact that nine of the flotilla's participants were killed and dozens were injured, he reached the conclusion that the public, political, and security interests in this case trump law enforcement. We did not find any ground for intervening in this decision or in the considerations at its foundation.&lt;ref name="ynetnews2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court also rejected three petitions demanding information on the whereabouts of some of the passengers brought to Ashdod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmaxworld.com/headline_story/Israel_court_flotilla/2010/06/03/316838.html |title=Breaking News, Politics, Commentary from around the world |publisher=Newsmaxworld.com |date=May 31, 2010 |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one leftist suit, the petitioners initially ascribed "illegal actions" to the State of Israel, calling its actions "massacre, murder, and ... piracy." But the petitioners revoked their petition after receiving the State Prosecutor's response and the Court's comments.&lt;ref name="ynetnews2"/&gt;  The Court observed:  "It is clear that the suit was filed in haste.  Even though the petitioners knew nothing of what had occurred, they did not hesitate to hurriedly place the gravest possible stain on the IDF forces' actions".&lt;ref name="ynetnews2"/&gt;

A petition submitted to the Israeli Supreme Court by the al-Jazeera television network, on behalf of journalists working for the network who had been arrested on the ship, requesting their release, was deemed moot as the journalists had already been released.&lt;ref name="ynetnews2"/&gt;

Lawyers representing the Turkish victims and the Turkish NGO [[IHH (Turkish NGO)|IHH]] wrote to [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]], [[prosecutor]] at the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) asking that the Israelis involved be criminally prosecuted before the ICC.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;The Guardian (UK), 2010 Oct. 8, "Gaza Flotilla Attack: Calls for International Criminal Court to Step in Turkish Victims Ask International Criminal Court to Pursue Israeli Gunmen over Raid on Ship," http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/08/israel-aid-flotilla-raid-calls&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICC has jurisdiction over the incident in international waters because the Mavi Marmara was sailing under flag of the [[Comoros]] and the Comoros is a state party to the ICC.

On 5 July 2013, the Presidency of the International Criminal Court (ICC) assigned “the Situation on Registered Vessels of the Union of the Comoros, the Hellenic Republic and the Kingdom of Cambodia” to Pre-Trial Chamber I.&lt;ref name=ICC-01-13&gt;Situation ICC-01-13 http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation-ICC-01-13/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICC-01/13 List of all Court records http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation-ICC-01-13/Court-Records/pages/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2014, the Office of the Prosecutor announced that it was concluding the preliminary examination of the situation referred by the Union of Comoros because legal requirements of the Rome Statute had not been met.

On 29 January 2015, the Representatives of the Government of the Union of the Comoros filed an Application for Review of the Prosecutor's Decision of 6 November 2014 not to initiate an investigation in the Situation.

On 24 April 2015, Pre-Trial Chamber I issued a decision on Victims’ Participation. It appointed the Principal Counsel of the Office of
Public Counsel for Victims as the Legal Representative for unrepresented victims and invited victims who had communicated with the Court to submit any observations deemed relevant to the Chamber’s review of the Prosecutor’s Decision.

On 22 June 2015, the Legal Representative submitted observations on behalf of 109 victims.

On 16 July 2015, Pre-Trial Chamber I of the International Criminal Court (ICC), composed of Judges Joyce Aluoch, Cuno Tarfusser and Péter Kovàcs, by majority, Judge Péter Kovács dissenting, granted the request of the Union of Comoros to review the decision of the ICC Prosecutor not to investigate the attack against a Humanitarian Aid Flotilla by the Israeli Armed Forces on 31 May 2010 and requested the Prosecutor to reconsider such decision.&lt;ref name=ICC-01-13/&gt;

On 27 July 2015, the Office of the Prosecutor appealed the decision of Pre-Trial Chamber I to the Appeals Chamber.&lt;ref&gt;ICC-01/13-35 Appeal Office of the Prosecutor http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc2024328.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2015, the Appeals Chamber decided by a majority that the appeal of the Prosecutor is inadmissible ''[[Motion in limine|in limine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;ICC-01/13-51 Appeals Chamber dismisses the appeal of the Prosecutor https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc2152672.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:lilmiss.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Cover of book documenting the case]] --&gt;

'''The Lil' Miss murder''' is the name given to the murder case of Lisa Marie Kimmell (July 18, 1969 – April 2, 1988), who disappeared while on a trip home from [[Colorado]] to [[Billings, Montana|Billings]], [[Montana]]. Her murder would remain a [[Cold case (criminology)|cold case]], until [[DNA profiling]] eventually linked a prison inmate to her kidnapping, rape and murder some 14 years later, which led investigators to the most vital piece of evidence in the case: Kimmell's missing car, which bore the distinctive personalized license plate that gave the case its name, "LIL MISS".

==Case history==
Kimmell was working in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] at an [[Arby's]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://billingsgazette.com/news/features/magazine/the-murder-of-lil-miss-former-billings-woman-writes-book/article_711309c0-38f9-5ee6-91e4-2689476c4772.html|title=The Murder of Lil Miss: Former Billings woman writes book about daughter's death|last=Tuttle|first=Greg|date=2005-07-02|work=The Billings Gazette|access-date=2017-07-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left on March 25, 1988, for her parents' home in [[Billings, Montana]]. She planned to stop in [[Cody, Wyoming]], along the way to pick up her boyfriend. [[Wyoming Highway Patrol]] records showed that she was stopped for speeding in [[Douglas, Wyoming]], just before she disappeared. Though unverified, some witnesses reported seeing her later that evening near Casper.

Eight days later her body was found floating in the North Platte River near [[Casper, Wyoming]], by a local fisherman. An [[autopsy]] determined that she had been bound, beaten and raped, for at least six days. Evidence showed that she was then taken to the Old Government Bridge ({{Coord|42.63824|-106.61748|type:event_region:US-WY|format=dms|display=inline,title}}), where she was hit on the head with a blunt object, stabbed six times in the chest and abdomen, before being thrown into the river. The autopsy showed that the head wound would have killed her in a matter of minutes even if she had not been stabbed.

Kimmell's case was profiled on the television program ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' within weeks, and [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]]'s ''[[Cold Case Files]]'' in the years since, with each case concentrating on locating witnesses who might have seen her black 1988 [[Honda CR-X]] automobile with a Montana plate bearing the unforgettable "LIL MISS" license plate. Investigators knew recovering the car was extremely important as it would be a direct link to the killer.

==Breakthrough==
In the summer of 2002, investigators researching cold cases came across Kimmell's rape kit, and a [[DNA profile]] was developed from the [[semen|seminal]] evidence. The [[CODIS]] database matched the DNA to Dale Wayne Eaton, 57, of [[Moneta, Wyoming]], who was then serving time in [[Federal Correctional Institution, Englewood|Englewood federal prison]] at [[Littleton, Colorado]] on an unrelated weapons charge. Eaton's DNA profile was placed in the [[CODIS]] database in 1997 after he was arrested on a separate charge: He had stopped to offer assistance to the Breeden family, whose car had broken down, but then he kidnapped the family at gunpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://trib.com/news/local/article_c2ec5d5f-ca01-5d76-bb33-d3031a6c6bf5.html|title='He tried to kill us'|last=Tuttle|first=Greg|date=2004-03-18|work=Casper Star-Tribune Online|access-date=2017-07-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his arrest for this kidnapping, Eaton escaped, but was later recaptured in [[Shoshone National Forest]]. At that time he possessed a weapon, elevating his crime to the federal level. He was then incarcerated in federal prison, where he was obliged to submit a DNA sample.

Eaton's next door neighbors reported to investigators that they had seen him digging a large hole on his property, which was located about an hour's drive from where Kimmell was last seen alive. The site was excavated and Kimmell's Honda CRX was unearthed, still bearing her distinctive "LIL MISS" license plate. Eaton was subsequently charged with eight crimes connected to the Kimmell case, including first-degree premeditated [[murder]], aggravated [[kidnapping]], aggravated [[robbery]], first-degree [[sexual assault]], and second-degree sexual assault.

A fellow inmate, Joseph Francis Dax, testified Eaton confessed to him as follows: Kimmell offered to give Eaton a ride, and Eaton accepted. He made sexual advances during the ride which Kimmel did not appreciate, so she pulled over to let him out of the car. The situation then escalated to kidnapping, rape, and murder.{{CN|date=November 2015}}

Eaton was found guilty of all charges and sentenced to death on March 20, 2004. He appealed this conviction and lost. Scheduled to be put to death in February 2010, he sought and received a stay of execution in December 2009. It was overturned in 2014. The state is again seeking the death penalty. He is currently awaiting a new sentencing hearing on death row. Eaton is currently the only inmate on Wyoming's [[death row]].

==Civil lawsuit==
Eaton's property was awarded to the Kimmell family after a [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death lawsuit]], and the buildings were burned to the ground on July 18, 2005, on what would have been Lisa Kimmell's 36th birthday.

==Related murders==
Kimmell 's murder may have been part of a pattern of serial murders, known as the Great Basin Murders, which took place between 1983 and 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/1599736/detail.html|title=Break In Great Basin Murders?|date=2002-08-07|work=7NEWS|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the victims were young women who initially disappeared, only to be later found murdered. Because her body was located in a popular fishing spot (creating a public spectacle) and that her car was buried on his property (kept as a trophy) it is believed that Eaton exhibited some of the tell-tale signs of being a serial killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/2180576/detail.html|title=Profilers: Denver Woman's Murder Points To Serial Killer|date=2003-05-05|work=7NEWS|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Disappearance of Amy Wroe Bechtel|Amy Wroe Bechtel]] is among the Great Basin killer's potential victims. On the morning of July 24, 1997, the 24-year-old left her [[Lander, Wyoming]] apartment to run errands. At 2:30 that afternoon, Bechtel was seen at a photo shop. This was the last confirmed sighting of Bechtel. It is believed she left the photo shop and drove into the Shoshone National Forest to check the course of a 10k race her gym was planning. When her husband returned home at 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., she was not home. By nightfall he alerted neighbors and the sheriff's department. Bechtel's white Toyota station wagon was found parked off a dirt road in the Shoshone Forest. No trace of Bechtel has been found but subsequent investigation placed Eaton on business in the area around the time of the disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/long-gone-girl|title=Long Gone Girl|last=Billman|first=Jon|date=2016-08-18|access-date=2017-02-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en|newspaper=Runner's World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
Both Kimmell's and Bechtel's cases were profiled on ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' and ''[[Nightmare Next Door]]''. To this day, Eaton remains silent about these or any other crimes he may be responsible for. True crime author [[Robert Scott (author)|Robert Scott]] wrote a book called ''Rivers of Blood'' that detail Eaton's life and crimes, including the disappearance and murder of Lisa Kimmell. The case was also profiled in an episode of ''[[On the Case with Paula Zahn|On The Case with Paula Zahn]]''.

The '''Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series''' is a short course [[off-road racing]] series in the United States. The series features events on the West Coast of the United States. The title sponsor for the series is [[Lucas Oil]].  It effectively replaced the [[Championship Off-Road Racing|CORR]] series.

==History==
There were two large sanctioning bodies in short course off-road racing for 2008: [[Championship Off-Road Racing|CORR]] and [[World Series of Off-Road Racing|WSORR]].  CORR had been sanctioning events on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and WSORR had sanctioned [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] events.  CORR closed before the end of the 2008 season and canceled its final two racing weekends. LOORRS took over the sanctioning of most of the West Coast events; and TORC, [[The Off Road Championship]], took over most of the Midwestern events.

The LOORRS series was founded for the 2009 season by [[Lucas Oil]] and its head Forrest Lucas.&lt;ref name="RacingWest20090728"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racingwest.com/news/articles/21365-leduc-brothers-dominate-at-rockstar-energy.html|title=Leduc Brothers Dominate at Rockstar Energy Drink's Lucas Oil Off Road Race in Lake Elsinore|date=2009-07-28|publisher=Racing West|accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Renezeder]] made short course off-road racing history in 2009 when he won the Unlimited 2 and Unlimited 4 class to become the first driver to win seven national championships.&lt;ref name="The AutoChannelNovember162009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2009/11/16/485164.html|title=Team General Tire's Carl Renezeder Makes History With U2 and U4 Championships|date=November 16, 2009|publisher=The Auto Channel|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, LOORRS announced that Ritchie Lewis would be taking over as the series' director.&lt;ref name="2012 New Schedule New Tracks New Management"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucas Oil Announces New Schedule, New Tracks, and New Management for Lucas Off Road Racing Series|url=http://www.lucasoiloffroad.com/series-news/283-lucas-oil-announces-new-schedule,-new-tracks-and-new-management-for-lucas-oil-off-road-racing-series|publisher=Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced the 2013 series schedule; it would continue racing at most of the same tracks.&lt;ref name="2012 New Schedule New Tracks New Management" /&gt; He also announced that Lucas would be building tracks at [[San Angelo, Texas]] and [[Lucas Oil Speedway]] to be used in 2014.&lt;ref name="2012 New Schedule New Tracks New Management" /&gt;

The '''Marshes Fire''' was a 2016 [[wildfire]] that burned just north of the [[Don Pedro Reservoir]] in [[Tuolumne County]], [[California]].&lt;ref name=cdf/&gt; The fire, which started on September 26, burned {{Convert| 1,080 |acre|km2|0}} of land from before being contained on October 4. Approximately 30 homes were evacuated and two minor injuries were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marshes Fire in Sonoma County Fully Contained: Cal Fire|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Marshes-Fire-in-Sonoma-County-Fully-Contained-Cal-Fire-395374341.html|accessdate=11 October 2016|work=NBC Bay Area|agency=[[NBC Bay Area]]|date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a dozen homes were evacuated in the Moccasin Ranch Estates subdivision during the first hours of the fire.&lt;ref name=evacs&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCarthy|first1=Guy|title=Marshes Fire cost $2.5 million so far|url=http://www.uniondemocrat.com/localnews/4699911-151/marshes-fire-cost-25-million-so-far|accessdate=11 October 2016|agency=[[The Union Democrat]]|date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pacific Gas and Electric]] also reported a number of power outages due to the fire.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7073">'''Mel's Hole''' is, according to an [[urban legend]], an allegedly "bottomless pit" near [[Ellensburg, Washington]]. Claims about it were first made on the radio show ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' by a guest calling himself "Mel Waters." Later investigation revealed no such person was listed as residing in that area and no credible evidence that the hole exists.&lt;ref name=uwtv1&gt;University of Washington (2004-08-01) "[http://www.uwtv.org/programs/displayevent.aspx?rID=5160&amp;fID=1474 Mel's Hole] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928074042/http://www.uwtv.org/programs/displayevent.aspx?rID=5160&amp;fID=1474 |date=2007-09-28 }}", University of Washington television (2007-05-28)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DR" /&gt;

== Description ==
The legend of the bottomless hole started on February 21, 1997, when a man identified as Mel Waters appeared as a guest on ''Coast to Coast AM'' with [[Art Bell]]. Waters claimed that he owned rural property nine miles west of [[Ellensburg, Washington|Ellensburg]] in [[Kittitas County, Washington|Kittitas County]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] that contained a mysterious hole. According to Bell's interviews with Waters, the hole had infinite depth and the ability to restore dead animals to life. Waters claimed to have measured the hole's depth to be more than 80,000 feet by using fishing line and a weight. According to Waters, the hole's magical properties prompted US "federal agents" to seize the land and fund his relocation to [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="DR" /&gt;

Waters made guest appearances on Bell's show in 1997, 2000, and 2002. Rebroadcasts of those appearances have helped create what's been described as a "modern, rural myth". The exact location of the hole was unspecified, yet several people claimed to have seen it,&lt;ref name=uwtv1/&gt;&lt;ref name=seateltimes1&gt;Zebrowski, John (2002-04-14) "[http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=melshole14m&amp;date=20020414 Expedition seeks paranormal pit]", The Seattle Times (2007-06-10)&lt;/ref&gt; such as Gerald R. Osborne, who used the ceremonial name Red Elk, who described himself as an "intertribal medicine man...half-breed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] / white",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/elk-red/5687&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://redelk.50webs.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and who told reporters in 2012 he visited the hole many times since 1961 and claimed the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] maintained a top secret base there where "[[extraterrestrial life|alien activity]]" occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=[[KOMO-TV]] News|title=Eastern Washington hole is shrouded in mystery|author=Denise Whitaker|date=February 8, 2012|url=http://komonews.com/news/local/eastern-washington-hole-is-shrouded-in-mystery-11-21-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DR" /&gt; But in 2002, Osborne was unable to find the hole on an expedition of 30 people he was leading.&lt;ref&gt;http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020414&amp;slug=melshole14m&lt;/ref&gt;

Local news reporters who investigated the claims found no public records of anyone named Mel Waters ever residing in, or owning property in Kittitas County. According to [[Washington State Department of Natural Resources|State Department of Natural Resources]] geologist Jack Powell, the hole does not exist and is geologically impossible. A hole of the depth claimed "would collapse into itself under the tremendous pressure and heat from the surrounding strata," said Powell. Powell said an ordinary old mine shaft on private property was probably the inspiration for the stories, and commented that Mel's Hole had established itself as a legend "based on no evidence at all".&lt;ref name="DR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnston|first1=Mike|title=Getting to the bottom of Mel's Hole|url=http://www.dailyrecordnews.com/news/getting-to-the-bottom-of-mel-s-hole/article_d72b6a68-7ac2-11e1-b3ce-001a4bcf887a.html|website=Daily Record|publisher=Washington Daily Record|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Aspects of Mel's Hole" art exhibit ==
An art exhibition, "Aspects of Mel's Hole: Artists Respond to a Paranormal Land Event Occurring in Radiospace," curated by ''[[LA Weekly]]'' art critic Doug Harvey, was presented at the Grand Central Art Center in [[Santa Ana, California]] in 2008. The show featured works by 41 artists and collectives, many created specifically for the exhibition, including works by Albert Cuellar, Charles Schneider, [[Marnie Weber]], [[Jim Shaw (artist)|Jim Shaw]], [[Jeffrey Vallance]], Georganne Deen, [[Paul Laffoley]], [[The Firesign Theater]], [[Gary Panter]], [[The Center for Land Use Interpretation]], James Hayward, Cathy Ward, Eric Wright and [[Craig Stecyk]]. The GCAC published a hardbound 146-page catalog in conjunction with the exhibit, containing contributions from all the artists, plus essays by Harvey, psychoanalyst Judy Spence, science author [[Margaret Wertheim]], Hannah Miller, Brian Tucker, Christine Wertheim, Mike Mcgee and the Rev. Ethan Acres.&lt;ref name=OCWeekly&gt;{{cite web|last=Stacy|first=Greg|title=Getting to the Bottom of Mel's Hole at the Grand Central Art Center|url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2008-10-02/culture/mels-hole-grand-central-art-center/full/|work=Thursday, Oct 2 2008|publisher=OCWeekly|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Monument-National''' is a historic Canadian theatre located at 1182 [[Saint Laurent Boulevard]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. Erected between 1891 and 1894, it was originally the cultural centre of the [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society]].

The building was designed by [[Maurice Perrault]], [[Albert Mesnard]] and [[Joseph Venne]] in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival style]] and utilizes a steel frame—a building technique that was innovative for its time.&lt;ref name=CRHP1&gt;{{CRHP|7154|Le Monument-National|August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yiddish theatre==
The first performance of a [[Yiddish]] play was held there in what is now the theatre's Ludger-Duvernay room in the winter of 1896. The Monument-National was a key cultural landmark in [[Historic Jewish Quarter, Montreal|Montreal's historic Jewish quarter]], and it continued to host productions from touring and local Yiddish theatre companies until the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Parks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/culture/proj/main/corridor1/corridor2.aspx|title=Boulevard Saint-Laurent: Corridor for Immigration, Business and Development|date=2009-04-15|work=Parks Canada Web site|accessdate=2009-05-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605115540/http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/culture/proj/main/corridor1/corridor2.aspx|archivedate=2011-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NTS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent-nts.ca/journal/j25p04_looking.htm|title=Looking Back : Monumental|date=Spring 2004|work=National Theatre School of Canada Web site|accessdate=2009-05-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925004343/http://ent-nts.ca/journal/j25p04_looking.htm|archivedate=2009-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://imjm.ca/location/1364 | title=Interactive Museum of Jewish Montreal |accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renovations and current status==
The theatre was declared a historic monument by the [[Ministère des Affaires culturelles du Québec]] in 1976,&lt;ref name=CRHP1/&gt; and a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{CRHP|14663|Monument National National Historic Site of Canada|August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major restoration project of the theatre was completed in June 1993, in time for the theatre's centennial celebration. The 1,620-seat theatre has been owned by the [[National Theatre School of Canada]] since 1971, and it is the venue used for its productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0002439|title=Monument national|work=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|author=[[Gilles Potvin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''No.&amp;nbsp;1 Long Range Flight''' was a temporary [[Royal Australian Air Force]] unit formed to participate in the [[1953 London to Christchurch air race|1953 London-to-Christchurch air race]] (also known as the Christchurch Centenary air race). The flight was established in February 1953 and was equipped with three  [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] bombers, specially modified between June and August. Following extensive training, two Canberras departed for the UK in mid-September. The race began on 9 October, and one of the flight's aircraft placed second, with a total flying time of 22&amp;nbsp;hours and 29&amp;nbsp;minutes. The other aircraft was forced out of the race when one of its tyres burst while landing at [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos Island]] to refuel, but completed its flight to Christchurch after being repaired. After a brief period in New Zealand both aircraft returned to Australia to be modified back to a standard configuration, and the flight was disbanded in November.

==History==
===Training===
No.&amp;nbsp;1 Long Range Flight was formed at [[RAAF Williams|RAAF Base Laverton]] on 16&amp;nbsp;February 1953 to begin preparations for the RAAF's participation in the London-to-Christchurch air race. Squadron Leader [[Peter Raw]] became the unit's initial commanding officer 23&amp;nbsp;February, and held this position until May when the more senior Wing Commander [[Derek Cuming|Derek R. Cuming]] assumed command.&lt;ref name="RAAF_HS_148"&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Cuming had been the first man to fly a jet aircraft in Australia (a [[Gloster Meteor]] in 1946), and had previously commanded the RAAF's [[Aircraft Research and Development Unit RAAF|Aircraft Research and Development Unit]] (ARDU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=P03702.001|url=http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/P03702.001|work=Collection|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aviation Services|url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/fam/0967.html|work=Federation and Meteorology|publisher=Australian Science and Technology Heritage Centre|accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In announcing his appointment to command No.&amp;nbsp;1 Long Range Flight, Minister for Air [[William McMahon]] described Cuming as the "RAAF's outstanding test pilot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55795917 |title=Air Face Flight Gets C.O.|newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=8 April 1953 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flight received its first aircraft, the Canberra bomber A84-307, on 15&amp;nbsp;June 1953.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_148 /&gt; This aircraft had been built in Britain as the RAAF's first Canberra, and was flown to Australia by Wing Commander Cuming in July 1951. The journey had been completed in 21&amp;nbsp;hours and 41&amp;nbsp;minutes, setting an unofficial record for the route.&lt;ref name=adf-serials&gt;{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Martin|title=RAAF Canberra A84 GAF Canberra Mk.20 &amp; Mk.21, EE Canberra B.2, T.4 &amp; U.10.|url=http://www.adf-serials.com/2a84.shtml|publisher=adf-serials.com|accessdate=28 May 2011|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flight's second aircraft, A84-201, arrived on 1&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_148 /&gt; This was the first Australian-built Canberra and was assigned to No.&amp;nbsp;1 Long Range Flight shortly after being completed.

These modifications included fitting distance-measuring equipment in each of the aircraft and three fuel tanks in their [[bomb bay]]s.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_148 /&gt;&lt;ref name=adf-serials /&gt; Wing Commander Cuming told journalists in August that the Australian-made Canberras were preferred to the British models on the grounds of national prestige and because the aircraft were fitted with superior navigation equipment.&lt;ref name=Rivalry /&gt;  A84-307 was retained by the flight, however, as the reserve aircraft to be used if modifications to A84-202 were not completed in time for the race.&lt;ref name=adf-serials /&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;1 Long Range Flight undertook intensive training in the lead-up to the race. This involved making regular long range return flights between Laverton and [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], [[Singapore]] and Christchurch via various air bases in Australia. These exercises were used to establish fuel consumption rates and practice the refuelling and navigation practices that would be used in the race.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_148 /&gt; As part of this training the flight broke many Australian and New Zealand air speed records, setting the fastest time for crossing the [[Tasman Sea]] during a flight between [[RAAF Base Amberley]] and Christchurch on 16&amp;nbsp;August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article57265125 |title=New Trans-Tasman Air Record. |newspaper=[[The Morning Bulletin]] |location=Rockhampton, Qld. |date=17 August 1953 |accessdate=28 May 2011 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aeronautical engineer was attached to No.&amp;nbsp;1 Long Range Flight from the [[Department of Air (Australia)|Department of Air]] to calculate the optimum route for the Canberras to take.&lt;ref name=Rivalry /&gt; On 2&amp;nbsp;September Cuming and Raw visited the [[Government Aircraft Factories]] facility at [[Port Melbourne, Victoria|Fishermans Bend]] in Melbourne to thank the workers who were building Canberra bombers for the RAAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article23319448 |title=Thanks a million far the Canberras. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=3 September 1953 |accessdate=11 June 2011 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race and aftermath===
Selected as Australia's entries in the London-to-Christchurch air race, A84-201 and A84-202 departed Laverton bound for the UK on 10&amp;nbsp;September 1953, and arrived at [[RAF Lyneham]] on the 16th of the month. Detachments of No. 1 Long Range Flight ground crew were stationed in the UK, [[Bahrain]], [[Ratmalana Airport]] in Ceylon, [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos Island]] in the Indian Ocean and Christchurch.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_148 /&gt; The first of these detachments departed Australia for the UK on 9&amp;nbsp;September.&lt;ref name="Rivalry"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27525071 |title=R.A.A.F.-R.A.F.

The RAAF also supported its entrants and the aircraft from other countries by deploying an air traffic control team and specialised radar equipment to Christchurch, as well as stationing [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|P-2 Neptune]] long-range patrol aircraft at Cocos Island, [[Perth]] and [[RAAF Base East Sale]] for search-and-rescue coverage.&lt;ref name="longest"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article62498239 |title=World's Longest &amp; Fastest Air Race|newspaper=[[Townsville Daily Bulletin]] |location=Qld. |date=15 September 1953 |accessdate=28 May 2011 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Australian Navy]] aircraft carrier [[HMS Vengeance (R71)|HMAS ''Vengeance'']] and destroyer {{HMAS|Bataan|I91|6}} were stationed in the Tasman Sea to provide weather reports for the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52936822|title=Two Warships At Fremantle.|newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=27 October 1953 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51067945 |title=Open for 2 days: Can Inspect Vengeance|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=3 October 1953 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The London-to-Christchurch air race began on 9&amp;nbsp;October. A84-202, which was piloted by Wing Commander Cuming, took off from [[London Heathrow Airport|London Airport]] at 3:50&amp;nbsp;am. A84-201, piloted by Squadron Leader Raw, followed five minutes later.&lt;ref name="RAAF_HS_148-149"&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the Canberras was also manned by a co-pilot and a navigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46455763 |title=Air race hopes:Ace fliers man local jets. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|date=30 September 1953 |accessdate=28 May 2011 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft flew separately to Bahrain, where they made a brief refuelling stop, then continued to Ratmalana Airport and Cocos Island where they refuelled again. One of A84-202's tyres burst while landing at Cocos Island, putting it out of the race.&lt;ref name=RAAF_HS_148-149 /&gt; At this time A84-202 was two minutes ahead of A84-201 and 15 minutes ahead of any of the entrants from the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).&lt;ref name="Repaired Canberra"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18392868 |title=Repaired Canberra Finishes Course. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=13 October 1953 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A84-201 continued and next landed at [[RAAF Woomera Airfield]] in South Australia to refuel. Its nose wheel locked up while landing due to ice accretion, but this was able to be repaired and the aircraft took off at 0:19&amp;nbsp;am, local time.&lt;ref name="RAAF_HS_149"&gt;RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; The repairs delayed the aircraft by 83 minutes, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50068300 |title=Records Broken in U.K. – N.Z.

The aircraft were transferred to No.&amp;nbsp;1 Aircraft Depot on 2&amp;nbsp;November to be returned to standard configuration, and No. 1&amp;nbsp; Long Range Flight's overseas detachments had all returned to Australia by 6&amp;nbsp;November.

The '''Rhode Island banking crisis''' took place in the early 1990s, when approximately a third of the state of [[Rhode Island]]'s population lost access to funds in their [[bank]] accounts. When a [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] bank failed due to long-term [[embezzlement]] by its manager, Joseph Mollicone, Jr., it triggered the collapse of the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation (RISDIC) and the subsequent closure of the 45 [[credit union]]s and banks it insured. 300,000 depositors lost access to their money. Though some of the institutions reopened relatively quickly after obtaining Federal insurance, many could not and remained closed for an extended period of time. Though everyone was eventually repaid, most had to wait months or years for compensation.

The shutdown sparked demonstrations and protests. Corruption hearings added to public frustration, when several executives and public officials were called to testify about their last minute withdrawals from banks just before their closure. The manhunt for Mollicone, who had fled to Utah, took nearly 18 months before he turned himself in. He was convicted, and given what at that time was the state's most severe sentence for a "[[white collar crime|white collar]]" offense.

==Heritage Loan &amp; Investment failure==

Heritage Loan &amp; Investment was a bank in the [[Federal Hill, Providence, Rhode Island|Federal Hill]] neighborhood of [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. In 1990, examiners with the state's Department of Business Regulation (DBR) discovered $13 million of fraudulent loans in the bank's records that had purportedly been made to 128 people and businesses that never asked for or received a loan.&lt;ref name=nytimes4january1991/&gt; The loans had been fabricated by bank manager, Joseph Mollicone Jr., who began taking money from the bank in 1986 and had set up more than 90 businesses to funnel the money through.&lt;ref name=wpri9may2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=projo30december2017/&gt; The ''Providence Journal'' reported that "he became legendary for dodging questions about missing bank records, once suggesting to a bank examiner: 'Let's have a muffin'."&lt;ref name=projo30december2017/&gt;

When Mollicone realized authorities had caught on, he fled the state. By the time he left on November 8, 1990, Mollicone had taken more than 80% of the money people deposited at the bank, according to prosecutor Kevin Bristow.&lt;ref name=nytimes13april1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=wpri9may2016/&gt; The state attorney general's office estimated that he stole $15.2 million overall.&lt;ref name=projo30december2017/&gt; In November 1990, Heritage Loan &amp; Investment closed.&lt;ref name=controllingthecrisis/&gt;

==Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation failure==
The Heritage Loan &amp; Investment bank was insured by the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation (RISDIC), a state-chartered private enterprise which backed 45 of the state's credit unions and banks. When Heritage customers learned of Mollicone's crimes, there was a [[bank run]] in which they withdrew $13 million of the bank's $22 million, using up a large part of RISDIC's $25 million reserve.&lt;ref name=nytimes4january1991/&gt; The state ordered the bank to close temporarily, but it reopened in December and customers started to take out all that was left, leaving RISDIC with almost nothing, [[insolvency|insolvent]].&lt;ref name=nytimes2january1991/&gt;

The nonprofit insurance enterprise got its start in 1971, but although it was intended to insure only small institutions, it increased from $134 million insured in 1972 to $761 million in 1980.&lt;ref name=lessons/&gt; It continued to expand through the 1980s, enabled by more lax state and federal laws. When it was founded, the per-account maximum to be insured was $40,000, but that number had increased to $500,000 in 1985, with no limit on some accounts.&lt;ref name=lessons/&gt;

The 1980s saw a trend of banks and credit unions shifting to federal ([[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|FDIC]] or [[National Credit Union Association|NCUA]]), rather than state and private insurers. The trend became particularly pronounced after Ohio and Maryland ran into bank crises of their own in 1985, similarly due to the collapse of private insurance entities. Banks that qualified for federal insurance would no longer take the risk of being insured by a strictly local, private insurer. Instead of learning from the mistakes of the other states, RISDIC responded to the loss of its most stable banks by increasing maximums and insuring more weak institutions. By the late 1980s, RISDIC was riddled with problems, insuring primarily those institutions that were unable to secure federal insurance, insuring large sums of money at weak banks.&lt;ref name=lessons/&gt;
[[File:Bruce Sundlun.jpg|thumb|upright|Rhode Island Governor [[Bruce Sundlun]] closed 45 banks and credit unions on the day of his inauguration.]]

Another risk concerned lack of oversight. Members of its board of trustees were primarily managers of the institutions it insured, and had no formal rules requiring any outside members, resulting in conflicts of interest. In the late 1980s, government budget cuts moved the responsibility for conducting examinations of the insurer from the Department of Business Regulation (DBR) to RISDIC itself, further reducing outside or independent oversight.&lt;ref name=lessons/&gt; In addition to being poorly regulated, it failed to abide by standard industry practices and although it formally adopted the standards of the National Association of Share Insurance Corporation, it did not actually implement them effectively.&lt;ref name=lessons/&gt;

Concerns had been raised about RISDIC for years before the Heritage scandal.&lt;ref name=nytimes4january1991/&gt; According to Pulkkinen and Rosengren, "Rhode Island Attorney General, federal banking regulators, and others privately counseled Rhode Island government officials on the perils of RISDIC as early as 1985 and 1986. [...] That RISDIC did not fail earlier was attributable to its political clout and its ability to mask severe financial difficulties within its underlying membership."&lt;ref name=lessons/&gt;

The Heritage collapse came just a year after Jefferson Loan and Investment Company, another RISDIC-insured bank, folded because of fraudulent leases.&lt;ref name=lessons/&gt; Jefferson used up a great deal of RISDIC's resources, leaving them in particularly bad shape when the even more costly Heritage collapse came about.

The day before [[Bruce Sundlun]] was to be inaugurated as [[Governor of Rhode Island]], replacing [[Edward D. DiPrete]], he was notified that RISDIC would fail.&lt;ref name=controllingthecrisis/&gt;

==Bank closures and aftermath==
[[File:Sheldon Whitehouse 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sheldon Whitehouse]], now a U.S. Senator, oversaw much of the banking crisis while working in Sundlun's administration.]]
By state law, banks and credit unions cannot legally operate without insurance. Sundlun posted state troopers at RISDIC-insured banks and, hours after his January 1, 1991, inauguration, ordered the indefinite closure of the 45 RISDIC-insured financial institutions, about three quarters of which were credit unions.&lt;ref name=controllingthecrisis/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes2january1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes2january1991/&gt;

Over 300,000 people, about a third of the state's population, lost access to their money, totaling about $1.7 billion.&lt;ref name=controllingthecrisis/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes2january1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=lessons/&gt; 

Some of the banks reopened relatively quickly, after obtaining federal insurance.&lt;ref name=nytimes2january1991/&gt; The [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) declined to provide insurance to some of the institutions that did not meet its standards and, shortly after the announcement of the closure, its chairman stated that it would not burden itself by providing extra help for the crisis or by repaying depositors if their accounts are salvageable.&lt;ref name=nytimes2january1991/&gt; But the events worried some in the federal government, who sent millions of dollars in cash to help protect against the consequences of bank runs on the larger national and regional banks that had not closed.&lt;ref name=controllingthecrisis/&gt;

According to a Sundlun spokesperson, although the state neither owned nor backed RISDIC, "it was decided that the state had a moral obligation to protect depositors".&lt;ref name=nytimes28may1992/&gt; Sundlun's administration set up the Depositors Economic Protection Corporation (DEPCO), which sold bonds in order to repay those whose money had been lost.&lt;ref name=nytimes28may1992/&gt; State [[sales tax]] was increased from 6% to 7% to help pay for the hundreds of millions of dollars in bonds.&lt;ref name=lastinglegacy/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes28may1992/&gt; The state's troubles were exacerbated by a weak economy and a significant budget deficit at the time of the closure&amp;mdash;$162 million on a $1.5 billion budget&amp;mdash;legally obligating lawmakers to close the budget gap at the same time as it looked for funds to compensate depositors.&lt;ref name=courant6september1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes2january1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes28may1992/&gt; 

Though the state persisted in taking measures to ensure people recouped their losses, progress was slow. The Governor announced a plan to allow depositors to withdraw up to half of the funds in their accounts up to a certain amount, but repayments to clients of still-closed banks did not begin until six months after the initial closure.&lt;ref name=lessons/&gt;&lt;ref name=csm10january1991/&gt; Eight months in, 200,000 customers at 13 institutions still could not access their deposits worth about $1.2 billion.&lt;ref name=courant6september1991/&gt; After a year, only 36 of the 45 institutions had reopened, and most of the biggest remained closed, including Rhode Island Central, the state's second largest credit union.&lt;ref name=nytimes2january1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=lessons/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap1september1991/&gt; By that time, depositors with small accounts of $2,500 or less had been repaid in full, but others with money at the nine still-closed institutions had only received about 10% of their funds.&lt;ref name=nytimes2january1992/&gt; Two and a half years after the closure, a small number of depositors still did not have access to their money.&lt;ref name=nytimes29july1993/&gt;

==Hearings and public reaction==
Local newspapers regularly printed lists of banks that had been opened or remained closed. Some depositors had houses foreclosed or other property repossessed; some businesses failed, while others had to lay off workers.&lt;ref name=nytimes2january1992/&gt; The number of bankruptcies in the state increased by 62% between 1990 and 1991.&lt;ref name=nytimes2january1992/&gt; Some businesses tried to adapt with an eye towards the crisis' resolution. Grocery chains Almacs and Stop &amp; Shop arranged to continue taking checks from closed banks, to be cashed later.&lt;ref name=csm10january1991/&gt; The Rhode Island Community Food Bank nonetheless had to distribute 30% more food than it did in 1990, totaling 4 million pounds.&lt;ref name=wapo2january1992/&gt;

The state Legislature formed a nine-person panel to look into the collapse of RISDIC and, in particular, how certain insiders managed to withdraw hundreds of thousands of dollars just before the announcement of the crisis, exacerbating the problem.&lt;ref name=ap1september1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes22july1991/&gt; The hearings began in July 1991, and were televised. According to ''The New York Times'', the hearings "transfixed the state" and, although the last minute withdrawals was not itself the cause of the closures, it gave "Rhode Islanders a focus for their frustration."&lt;ref name=nytimes22july1991/&gt; Among those questioned about their suspiciously timed withdrawals were the Mayor of [[North Providence, Rhode Island|North Providence]], a state senator, credit union executives, RISDIC's former president, the former president's family, and a State Representative who also helped to kill a bill which would have forced credit unions to be federally insured.&lt;ref name=nytimes22july1991/&gt;

Affected citizens held regular protests and demonstrations from the beginning of the crisis, but several noteworthy events occurred in the weeks following the hearings.&lt;ref name="controllingthecrisis" /&gt; In August 1991, about 250 angry depositors left a meeting and converged on an [[Interstate 95]] on-ramp, blocking traffic in protest.&lt;ref name=wapo2january1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap1september1991/&gt; Seven people were arrested, including husband and wife Donald and Raymonde Wolstenholme, recent retirees whose savings were frozen at a credit union in [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island|Woonsocket]]. The Wolstenholmes were profiled by local and national media following their arrest as a symbol of unrest and the crisis' continued effect of regular citizens.&lt;ref name=ap1september1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=wapo2january1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=courant6september1991/&gt; Two days later, 200 staged a march from the Statehouse to DEPCO offices.&lt;ref name=ap1september1991/&gt; In one event in September 1991, more than 500 chanting protesters gathered at the Statehouse and dumped [[teabag]]s in front of the Governor's office, symbolizing being on the verge of a revolt by referencing the [[Boston Tea Party]].&lt;ref name="nytimes2january1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="courant6september1991" /&gt; Another protest the following month, staged in response to an announcement revealing the next phase of the administration's repayment strategy, which focused on a small number of institutions and included financial actions that did not directly repay depositors.&lt;ref name="upi21october1991" /&gt; Demonstrators hanged an [[effigy]] of Sundlun a lamp post outside the capitol.&lt;ref name="upi21october1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name=courant6september1991/&gt; Dedicated activist organizations formed, such as the [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]]-based Citizens for Depositors' Rights Organization.&lt;ref name="courant6september1991" /&gt; Speaking of the unrest, U.S. Senator [[Sheldon Whitehouse]], who at the time worked in the Sundlun administration, handling the crisis as Director of Policy, said "My car was keyed. My tires were slashed. People came through the State House literally smearing excrement on the walls."&lt;ref name="controllingthecrisis" /&gt;

According to ''The New York Times'', the banking crisis was the major catalyst in an "ethics movement" or even "citizen revolt" against corruption in Rhode Island. Sundlun, reflecting on the events of 1991, said it was the year when "the dishonesty, greed and corruption that rotted our system was exposed for all to see."&lt;ref name=nytimes23february1992/&gt; Several non-profits and [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]s formed to advocate for citizens rights, demand accountability, or otherwise fight corruption.&lt;ref name=nytimes23february1992/&gt;

==Resolution==
In total, 25 of the institutions obtained federal insurance and retained their status as independent banks or credit unions. Two [[Depository institution|nondepository institutions]] became inactive. Of the other depository institutions, customers at six were repaid by the end of 1991, six were acquired by other businesses (one by Coventry Credit Union, one by First Bank and Trust, and four by Northeast Savings), and six remained closed with at least some customers still unpaid.&lt;ref name=lessons/&gt;

Eventually, according to Sundlun, all of the money was returned with interest.&lt;ref name=controllingthecrisis/&gt; Though he received criticism at the time from affected depositors and other segments of the public, some of whom called for his [[impeachment]], Sundlun continued to stand by his decisions years later. Likewise, Whitehouse said it "without a doubt" could not have gone better.&lt;ref name=controllingthecrisis/&gt;&lt;ref name=courant6september1991/&gt;

Following the crisis, Rhode Island banks are now insured by federal entities, not just local institutions.&lt;ref name=lastinglegacy/&gt; The sales tax increase which was intended to be temporary was never repealed.&lt;ref name=lastinglegacy/&gt;

==Possible connections to organized crime and corruption==

There had been questions about RISDIC's stability for some time, but nothing was done. In an interview with ''The New York Times'', Lee Blais, former director of investigations for the state Attorney General, said that in 1985 he told then-Governor DiPrete (who, years later, would guilty to 18 counts of [[racketeering]], extortion, and bribery unrelated to the bank crisis) about connections between Heritage and organized crime, and gave to him a report detailing problems with RISDIC, but nothing was done.&lt;ref name=nytimes4january1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=projo15february2016/&gt;

According to Jim O'Neil, then the state's attorney general, [[cronyism]], corruption, and connections between RISDIC and politicians were major concerns in the time before RISDIC's collapse: "The paramount problem ... was the inside game and inside people getting loans. They were scratching each others' backs."&lt;ref name=lastinglegacy/&gt; Audits had not been carried out at Heritage on the schedule required by RISDIC; the insurer did not notify the Attorney General of problems it found at Heritage when it did conduct an audit; Mollicone himself had been vice chairman of RISDIC; Mollicone as well as others at RISDIC were well-connected to politicians; Heritage's board comprised Mollicone's friends and family; board members did not attend regular meetings; Mollicone even had a family connection, through his father, to [[Raymond L. S. Patriarca]], head of the [[Patriarca crime family]].&lt;ref name=nytimes4january1991/&gt;

Police Captain Brian Andrews told the ''New York Times'' that the previous year, Mollicone had reported that vandals had entered the bank illegally, but that he would "take care of it myself," citing his connection to [[Luigi Manocchio|Luigi "Baby Shacks" Manocchio]], a major figure in the Patriarca network.&lt;ref name=nytimes4january1991/&gt; Manocchio had been seen entering the bank on multiple occasions.&lt;ref name=nytimes4january1991/&gt;

Throughout the Heritage investigations, law enforcement tried to connect Mollicone and the bank to organized crime. One anonymous official told ''The New York Times'' that the bank may have been used to [[money laundering|launder money]] for members of organized crime, obscuring the true identities of the people who owned the money.&lt;ref name=nytimes4january1991/&gt; Among the people's names Mollicone used for the fake loans were members of his family, golfing partners, and [[Buddy Cianci]].&lt;ref name=nytimes4january1991/&gt; Cianci was Mayor of Providence until convicted of felony assault, then re-elected years later, only to be sent to prison on racketeering charges. He and Mollicone had several dealings regarding real estate, permits, and banking.&lt;ref name=nytimes4january1991/&gt;

==Mollicone trial and repayment==
===Search for Mollicone===
Joseph Mollicone, Jr.'s name became synonymous with the banking crisis after he set off the chain of events with his theft of between $12 million and $15.2 million from Heritage Loan &amp; Investment.&lt;ref name=lastinglegacy/&gt;&lt;ref name=projo30december2017/&gt; The "state's most wanted fugitive" according to ''[[WJAR-TV]]'', law enforcement looked for him for nearly a year and a half without success. There were rumors his alleged Mafia connections led him to Italy, but later revealed he had been hiding in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], chosen only because he had traveled there in the past.&lt;ref name=lastinglegacy/&gt;&lt;ref name=wpri9may2016/&gt; He took the name of an acquaintance who died just before he fled, John Fazzioli, and according to the ''Providence Journal'' "lived under the persona of a Boston jewelry manufacturer who had come to Utah to ski and relax."&lt;ref name=projo30december2017/&gt;

In 1992, Mollicone's wife and four children in Rhode Island had their home foreclosed and had to file for bankruptcy. At that point, in April 1992, after nearly 18 months in hiding, he turned himself in.&lt;ref name=nytimes29july1993/&gt; He had met and lived with a girlfriend in Utah who did not know his real identity. In what the state prosecutor found to be a salient demonstration of character, he also left her in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy when he returned to RI.&lt;ref name=projo30december2017/&gt;

===Trial===
Rhode Island attorney general Jeff Pine took office in January 1993, just a few months before the trial, inheriting the case from his predecessor. He appointed Kevin Bristow as new lead prosecutor and the trial began in March 1993, after a 60-day [[continuance]].&lt;ref name=turnto1019february2015/&gt; Mollicone admitted to and apologized for his crimes, and his lawyer characterized him as "a sucker."&lt;ref name=nytimes29july1993/&gt; The Superior Court Judge, Dominic Cresto, responded by saying that Mollicone had "considerable talents and persuasive manipulative abilities through the use of charm and guile," and said he had "a conscious, systematic scheme of plundering bank assets entrusted to him."&lt;ref name=nytimes29july1993/&gt;

Witnesses for the prosecution included the former vice president of Heritage Loan &amp; Investment, someone with knowledge of Mollicone's purchase of a [[Ferrari (car)|Ferrari]], Mollicone's girlfriend in Salt Lake City, and another friend from Utah. Although they did not know his true identity, his Utah-based connections testified about his life and lifestyle while on the run.&lt;ref name=turnto1019february2015/&gt; The prosecution also had surveillance footage from the bank.&lt;ref name=turnto1019february2015/&gt;

On April 23, 1993, he was convicted on 26 counts, including [[embezzlement]], [[bank fraud]], and conspiring to create false bank documents.&lt;ref name=nytimes29july1993/&gt; He was sentenced to 30 years in prison and ordered to pay $420,000 in fines and $12 million in restitution. The latter figure was the amount the judge determined had been proven stolen, though it was less than the amount the prosecution alleged.&lt;ref name=nytimes29july1993/&gt; At the time, it was the state's most severe sentence for a [[white collar crime|"white collar"]] offense.&lt;ref name=nytimes29july1993/&gt;

===Release and repayment===
Mollicone was released on [[parole]] in 2003, after serving 10 years of his sentence. Upon release, he told a reporter that, with regard to the money he stole, "people who are supposed to know, know it's gone."&lt;ref name=turnto1019february2015/&gt;

He will be on parole until 2023, and probation until 2025.&lt;ref name=projo30december2017/&gt; Upon release he was ordered to begin repaying the fines and restitution. Though first drawn from his wages, he then retired, making payments out of his [[social security]] income.&lt;ref name=lastinglegacy/&gt;&lt;ref name=wpri9may2016/&gt; Another condition of his release was a requirement that he talk about business ethics with students.&lt;ref name=turnto1019february2015/&gt;

In 2009 a judge granted the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) permission to take legal action against Mollicone and to seize any assets he has in order to pay $33 million in taxes and associated penalties and interest from the time he was still working at Heritage Loan &amp; Investment.&lt;ref name=projo30december2017/&gt; The IRS has not confirmed whether they have taken those measures.&lt;ref name=projo30december2017/&gt;

{{as of|2017|12}}, the 74-year-old Mollicone was still living in Rhode Island and was working two jobs. He was paying between $217-$300 each month towards the debt, totaling $33,947.50 since his release, a rate at which it would take thousands of years to pay back.&lt;ref name=projo30december2017/&gt;

{{Censorship by country}}'''Sedition''' is overt conduct, such as [[Speech communication|speech]] and [[organization]], that tends toward [[insurrection]] against the established order. Sedition often includes [[subversion]] of a [[constitution]] and [[incitement]] of discontent towards, or [[rebellion|resistance]] against established authority. Sedition may include any commotion, though not aimed at direct and open violence against the laws. Seditious words in writing are [[seditious libel]]. A '''seditionist''' is one who engages in or promotes the interest of sedition.

Typically, sedition is considered a subversive act, and the [[overt act]]s that may be prosecutable under sedition laws vary from one legal code to another. Where the history of these legal codes has been traced, there is also a record of the change in the definition of the elements constituting sedition at certain points in history. This overview has served to develop a [[sociology|sociological]] definition of sedition as well, within the study of state [[persecution]].

==History in common law jurisdictions==
The term ''sedition'' in its modern meaning first appeared in the [[Elizabethan Era]] (c. 1590) as the "notion of inciting by words or writings disaffection towards the state or constituted authority". "Sedition complements treason and martial law: while treason controls primarily the privileged, ecclesiastical opponents, priests, and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], as well as certain commoners; and martial law frightens commoners, sedition frightens intellectuals."&lt;ref name="Breight1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. Breight|title=Surveillance, Militarism and Drama in the Elizabethan Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_RZCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90|date=7 November 1996|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-37302-0|pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{main|Australian sedition law}}
[[Australia]]'s sedition laws were amended in [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005|anti-terrorism legislation]] passed on 6 December 2005, updating definitions and increasing penalties.

In late 2006, the Commonwealth Government, under the Prime-Ministership of John [[John Howard|Howard]] proposed plans to amend Australia's [[Australian criminal law|Crimes Act 1914]], introducing laws that mean artists and writers may be jailed for up to seven years if their work was considered seditious or inspired sedition either deliberately or accidentally.&lt;ref name="Gaol"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2006/s1772767.htm Satire used to counter new sedition laws], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s ''[[Lateline]]'' transcript, 24 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of these laws have suggested that they could be used against legitimate dissent.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 2006, the then Australian attorney-general Philip Ruddock had rejected calls by two reports — from a [[Australian Senate|Senate]] committee and the [[Australian Law Reform Commission]] — to limit the sedition provisions in the [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005|Anti-Terrorism Act 2005]] by requiring proof of intention to cause disaffection or violence. He had also brushed aside recommendations to curtail new clauses outlawing “urging conduct” that “assists” an “organisation or country engaged in armed hostilities” against the [[Australian military]].

The new laws, inserted into the legislation December 2005, allow for the criminalization of basic expressions of political opposition, including supporting resistance to Australian military interventions, such as those in [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and the [[Asia-Pacific]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2006/oct2006/sedi-o27.shtml Australia’s new Sedition Laws], Mike Head, ''World Socialist Web Site'', 27 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These laws were amended in Australia on 19 September 2011. The ‘sedition’ clauses were repealed and replaced with ‘urging violence’. [http://www.visualarts.net.au/newsdesk/2011/09/sedition-deleted-in-national-security-legislation-amendment-act]

===Canada===
In Canada, sedition, which includes speaking seditious words, publishing a seditious libel, and being party to a seditious conspiracy, is an indictable offense, for which the maximum punishment is of fourteen years' imprisonment.

During [[World War II]] former [[Mayor]] of [[Montreal]] [[Camillien Houde]] campaigned against [[conscription]] in [[Canada]]. On 2 August 1940, Houde publicly urged the men of [[Quebec]] to ignore the National Registration Act. Three days later, he was placed under [[arrest]] by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] on charges of sedition. After being found guilty, he was confined in [[internment camps]] in [[Petawawa]], [[Ontario]], and [[Gagetown, New Brunswick|Gagetown]], [[New Brunswick]], until 1944. Upon his release on 18 August 1944, he was greeted by a cheering crowd of 50,000 Montrealers and won back his position as the Mayor of Montreal in the election in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/camillien-houde/|title=Camillien Houde|last=McKenna|first=Brian|date=March 4, 2015|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 2012, [[Aseem Trivedi]], a [[political cartoonist]], was sent to judicial custody till 24 September 2012 on charges of sedition over a series of cartoons against [[Corruption in India|corruption]]. Trivedi was accused of uploading "ugly and obscene" content to his website, also accused of insulting the Constitution during an [[2011 Indian anti-corruption movement|anti-corruption protest]] in Mumbai in 2011. Trivedi's arrest under sedition has been heavily criticised in India.

In February 2016, JNU student union president Kanhaiya Kumar was arrested on charges of Sedition under section 124-A of Indian Penal Code (which was part of the sedition laws implemented by the British Rule).

Sedition charges were not uncommon in [[New Zealand]] early in the 20th century. For instance, the future [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Peter Fraser]] had been convicted of sedition in his youth for arguing against conscription during World War I, and was imprisoned for a year. Perhaps ironically, Fraser re-introduced the [[conscription]] of troops as the Prime Minister during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/timeline&amp;new_date=22/12 Today in History: 22 December 1916 – Future PM Fraser charged with sedition], nzhistory.net.nz, History Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sedition was a [[common law offence]] in the UK. [[James Fitzjames Stephen]]'s "Digest of the Criminal Law" stated that: 
{{quote|…a seditious intention is an intention to bring into hatred or contempt, or to exite disaffection against the person of His Majesty, his heirs or successors, or the government and [[constitution of the United Kingdom]], as by law established, or either House of Parliament, or the administration of justice, or to excite His Majesty's subjects to attempt otherwise than by lawful means, the alteration of any matter in Church or State by law established, or to incite any person to commit any crime in disturbance of the peace, or to raise discontent or disaffection amongst His Majesty's subjects, or to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of such subjects.

An intention to show that His Majesty has been misled or mistaken in his measures, or to point out errors or defects in the government or constitution as by law established, with a view to their reformation, or to excite His Majesty's subjects to attempt by lawful means the alteration of any matter in Church or State by law established, or to point out, in order to secure their removal, matters which are producing, or have a tendency to produce, feelings of hatred and ill-will between classes of His Majesty's subjects, is not a seditious intention.}}

Stephen in his "History of the Criminal Law of England" accepted the view that a [[seditious libel]] was nothing short of a direct incitement to disorder and violence. He stated that the modern view of the law was plainly and fully set out by Littledale J. in ''Collins''. In that case the jury were instructed that they could convict of seditious libel only if they were satisfied that the defendant "meant that the people should make use of physical
force as their own resource to obtain justice, and meant to excite the people to take the power in to their own hands, and meant to excite them to tumult and disorder."

The last prosecution for sedition in the [[United Kingdom]] was in 1972, when three people were charged with seditious conspiracy and uttering seditious words for attempting to recruit people to travel to [[Northern Ireland]] to fight in support of Republicans. The seditious conspiracy charge was dropped, but the men received suspended sentences for uttering seditious words and for offences against the [[Public Order Act]].&lt;ref name="LC72"&gt;The Law Commission, Treason, Sedition and Allied Offences (Working Paper No.72), paragraphs 78 and 96(6) [http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1977/c72.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[1977]&lt;/nowiki&gt; EWLC C72, BAILII]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, a [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] [[working paper]] recommended that the common law offence of sedition in England and Wales be abolished. They said that they thought that this offence was redundant and that it was not necessary to have any offence of sedition.&lt;ref name="LC72" /&gt; However this proposal was not implemented until 2009, when sedition and seditious libel (as common law offences) were abolished by section 73 of the [[Coroners and Justice Act 2009]] (with effect on 12 January 2010).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2009/ukpga_20090025_en_6 Coroners and Justice Act 2009].

In 1798, President [[John Adams]] signed into law the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], the fourth of which, the ''Sedition Act'' or "An Act for the Punishment of Certain Crimes against the United States" set out punishments of up to two years of imprisonment for "opposing or resisting any law of the United States" or writing or publishing "false, scandalous, and malicious writing" about the [[President of the United States|President]] or the [[U.S. Congress]] (though not the office of the [[Vice-President of the United States|Vice-President]], then occupied by Adams' political opponent [[Thomas Jefferson]]). This Act of Congress was allowed to expire in 1801 after Jefferson's election to the Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.house.gov/HistoricalHighlight/Detail/36271?ret=True|title=The Sedition Act of 1798|last=|first=|date=|website=History, Art &amp; Archives, U.S. House of Representatives|access-date=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jesus wanted poster.jpg|alt=|thumb|Political cartoon by [[Art Young]], ''[[The Masses]]'', 1917.]]
In the [[Espionage Act of 1917]], Section 3 made it a federal crime, punishable by up to 20 years of imprisonment and a fine of up to $10,000, to willfully spread false news of the American army or navy with an intent to disrupt its operations, to foment mutiny in their ranks, or to obstruct recruiting. This Act of Congress was amended by the [[Sedition Act of 1918]], which expanded the scope of the Espionage Act to any statement criticizing the [[Government of the United States]]. These Acts were upheld in 1919 in the case of ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'', but they were largely repealed in 1921, leaving laws forbidding foreign espionage in the United States and allowing military [[censorship]] of sensitive material.

In 1940, the Alien Registration Act, or "[[Smith Act]]", was passed, which made it a federal crime to advocate or to teach the desirability of overthrowing the [[United States Government]], or to be a member of any organization which does the same. It was often used against [[Communist Party]] organizations. This Act was invoked in three major cases, one of which against the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Worker's Party]] in [[Minneapolis]] in 1941, resulting in 23 convictions, and again in what became known as the [[Great Sedition Trial of 1944]] in which a number of pro-[[Nazi]] figures were indicted but released when the prosecution ended in a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]]. Also, a series of trials of 140 leaders of the [[Communist Party USA]] also relied upon the terms of the "Smith Act"—beginning in 1949—and lasting until 1957. Although the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld the convictions of 11 CPUSA leaders in 1951 in [[Dennis v. United States]], that same Court reversed itself in 1957 in the case of ''[[Yates v. United States]]'', by ruling that teaching an ideal, no matter how harmful it may seem, does not equal advocating or planning its implementation. Although unused since at least 1961, the "Smith Act" remains a Federal law.

There was, however, a brief attempt to use the sedition laws against protesters of the Vietnam War. On 17 October 1967, two demonstrators, including then Marin County resident Al Wasserman, while engaged in a "sit-in" at the Army Induction Center in [[Oakland, California]], were arrested and charged with sedition by deputy US. Marshall Richard St. Germain. U.S. Attorney Cecil Poole changed the charge to trespassing. Poole said, "three guys (according to Mr. Wasserman there were only 2) reaching up and touching the leg of an inductee, and that's conspiracy to commit sedition? That's ridiculous!" The inductees were in the process of physically stepping on the demonstrators as they attempted to enter the building, and the demonstrators were trying to protect themselves from the inductees' feet. Attorney Poole later added, "We'll decide what to prosecute, not marshals."&lt;ref&gt;''San Francisco Chronicle'', 21 October 1967, p. 7, ''UPI – Independent Journal of Marin'', 21 October 1967, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Oscar López Rivera]], a Puerto Rican Nationalist and Vietnam war veteran, was convicted and sentenced to 70 years in prison for seditious conspiracy and various other offenses. He was among the 16 Puerto Rican nationalists offered conditional clemency by U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1999, but he rejected the offer. His sister, Zenaida López, said he refused the offer because on parole, he would be in "prison outside prison".

In 1987, fourteen white supremacists were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice against a seditious conspiracy between July 1983 and March 1985. Some alleged conspirators were serving time for overt acts, such as the crimes committed by [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]]. Others such as [[Louis Beam]] and [[Richard Girnt Butler|Richard Butler]] were charged for their speech seen as spurring on the overt acts by the others. In April 1988, a federal jury in Arkansas acquitted all the accused of charges of seditious conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/beam.asp "Louis Beam" at Anti-Defamation League (ADL) website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219220144/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/beam.asp |date=19 December 2011 }}.

[[File:Abbé pratiquant la simonie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Abbot practising simony (France, 12th century)]]
'''Simony''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|m|ə|n|i}} is the act of selling church offices and roles. It is named after [[Simon Magus]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Reader's Encyclopedia'' (1965), New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company, vol.2, ''p.''932, "Simon."&lt;/ref&gt; who is described in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] 8:9–24 as having offered two disciples of [[Jesus]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], payment in exchange for their empowering him to impart the power of the [[Holy Spirit]] to anyone on whom he would [[Laying on of hands|place his hands]].  The term extends to other forms of trafficking for money in "spiritual things."&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1880)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="halsbury832"&gt;''Halsbury'' '''832'''&lt;/ref&gt; Simony was one of the important issues during the [[Investiture Controversy]].

==History==
===Catholic Church===
Although an offense against [[canon law]], Simony became widespread in the [[Catholic Church]] in the 9th and 10th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions, edited by Wendy Doniger, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In the canon law, the word bears a more extended meaning than in [[English law]]. ''Simony according to the canonists'', says [[John Ayliffe]] in his ''[[John Ayliffe#Works|Parergon]]'',
{{quote|"...is defined to be a deliberate act or a premeditated will and desire of selling such things as are spiritual, or of anything annexed unto spirituals, by giving something of a temporal nature for the purchase thereof; or in other terms it is defined to be a commutation of a thing spiritual or annexed unto spirituals by giving something that is temporal."}}

[[File:Tizian 109.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Girolamo and cardinal Marco Corner investing Marco, abbot of Carrara, with his benefice, [[Titian]], ca 1520&lt;/center&gt;]]

In the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]'' the Decretum&lt;ref&gt;Pt. ii. cause i. quest. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and the Decretals&lt;ref&gt;Bk. v. tit. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; deal with the subject. The offender whether ''simoniacus'' (the perpetrator of a simoniacal transaction) or ''simoniace promotus'' (the beneficiary of a simoniacal transaction), was liable to deprivation of his benefice and deposition from orders if a [[Secular clergy|secular priest]], or to confinement in a stricter [[monastery]] if a [[Regular clergy|regular]]. No distinction seems to have been drawn between the sale of an immediate and of a reversionary interest. The innocent ''simoniace promotus'' was, apart from dispensation, liable to the same penalties as though he were guilty.{{clarify|date=August 2013}}

Certain matters were simoniacal by the [[canon law]] but would not be regarded as such in English law.{{efn|For example, the sale of [[tithes]], the taking of a fee for [[Confession (religion)|confession]], absolution, marriage or burial, the concealment of one in [[mortal sin]] or the reconcilement of an impenitent for the sake of gain, and the doing of [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for spiritualities.}} So grave was the crime of simony considered that even infamous persons (deprived of citizens' rights due to conviction) could accuse another of it. English provincial and [[legatine]] constitutions continually assailed simony.

===Church of England===
The [[Church of England]] struggled with the practice after its separation from Rome. For the purposes of [[English law]], simony is defined by [[William Blackstone]] as "obtain[ing] orders, or a licence to preach, by money or corrupt practices"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackstone|first=William|title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] vol I|date=1765|pages=376–7|place=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, more narrowly, "the corrupt presentation of any one to an ecclesiastical [[benefice]] for gift or reward".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackstone|first=William|title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] vol IV|date=1769|page=62|place=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While [[English and Welsh law|English law]] recognized simony as an offence,&lt;ref&gt;'''3''' ''[[Edward Coke|Coke's Institutes]]'' 153–156&lt;/ref&gt; it treated it as merely an ecclesiastical matter, rather than a crime, for which the punishment was forfeiture of the office or any advantage from the offence and severance of any patronage relationship with the person who bestowed the office. Both [[Edward VI of England]] and [[Elizabeth I]] promulgated statutes against simony, in the latter case through the [[Simony Act 1588]].  The cases of [[Bishop of St. David's]] [[Thomas Watson (Bishop of St David's)|Thomas Watson]] in 1699&lt;ref&gt;Handley, S. (2004) "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28868 Watson, Thomas (1637–1717)]", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press. Retrieved 21 August 2007 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Dean of York]] [[Sir William Cockburn, 11th Baronet|William Cockburn]] in 1841 were particularly notable.&lt;ref name="times410410"&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 10 April 1841, p.6 col.b, reprinted from the ''Cambridge Advertiser''&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Benefice]]s Act 1892, a person guilty of simony is guilty of an offence for which he may be proceeded against under the Clergy Discipline Act 1892. An innocent clerk is under no disability, as he might be by the canon law. Simony may be committed in three ways – in promotion to orders, in presentation to a [[benefice]], and in resignation of a [[benefice]]. The [[common law]] (with which the canon law is incorporated, as far as it is not contrary to the common or statute law or the prerogative of [[the Crown]]) has been considerably modified by statute. Where no statute applies to the case, the doctrines of the canon law may still be of authority.

{{As of|2011}}, simony remains an offence.&lt;ref name="halsbury832"&gt;''Halsbury'' '''832'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="halsbury1359"&gt;''Halsbury'' '''1359'''&lt;/ref&gt; An unlawfully bestowed office can be declared void by [[the Crown]], and the offender can be disabled from making future appointments and fined up to £1000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simony Act 1588]], s.4&lt;/ref&gt; Clergy are no longer required to make a declaration as to simony on [[ordination]], but offences are now likely to be dealt with under the [[Clergy Discipline Measure 2003]],&lt;ref&gt;2003 No.3&lt;/ref&gt; r.8.&lt;ref name="halsbury1359"/&gt;

'''Soulé Steam Feed Works''' is a historic business founded in [[Meridian, Mississippi]] in 1891 by George Soulé. The complex was listed as a contributing property to [[Union Station Historic District]], which was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979 under the Meridian [[Multiple Property Submission|Multiple Resource Area (MRA)]]. It was listed as a [[Mississippi Landmark]] in 2003. The business, known for its many patented innovations in [[steam engine]] technology, reached its height around the turn of the century, producing products that were sold around the world.{{clarify|reason=which century?|date=June 2012}}

In 2003, the '''Mississippi [[Industrial heritage|Industrial Heritage]] Museum''' obtained the lease to the complex and has operated there since. The city holds an annual '''Soulé Live Steam Festival''' at the complex attracting thousands of people from around the nation.

==George Soulé==
George Wilberforce Soulé, founder of Soulé Steam Feed Works, was born in [[Buffalo, New York]] in 1849. He was a descendant of another [[George Soule (Mayflower passenger)|George Soule]] who came to America on the [[Mayflower]].&lt;ref name=Soulequote&gt;{{cite book|title=Meridian: The Queen with a Past|author=Jack Shank|publisher=Southeastern Printing Company|location=Meridian, Mississippi|year=1986|isbn=0-9616123-2-0|volume=Volume II|page=56|quote=Born in Buffalo, New York, in 1849, G. W. Soulé was a descendant of another George Soulé that came over on the Mayflower.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of one, he and his father, Isaac, moved to [[Wisconsin]]. When young George was 20 years old, his father died, and he decided to leave the family farm and pursue his own livelihood. Despite having obtained less than one year of formal education, he served as a school teacher for one three-month term before heading south to end up in [[Morton, Mississippi]], in 1875.&lt;ref name=queenpast&gt;{{cite book|title=Meridian: The Queen with a Past|author=Jack Shank|publisher=Southeastern Printing Company|location=Meridian, Mississippi|year=1986|isbn=0-9616123-2-0|volume=Volume II|pages=56–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had originally missed a ship to [[Cuba]], but stayed at several businesses in Morton and [[Shubuta, Mississippi]], before moving his operations to Meridian in 1879. Businesses operated by Soulé upon entering Meridian included a [[turpentine]] company, a lumber company, a [[cotton gin]], and a manufacturer's representative.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt; Before he moved to Meridian, he was involved in a railroad accident in March 1876 in which he lost his left leg and four toes of his right foot.&lt;ref name=queenpast/&gt;

Soulé founded two other companies before Steam Feed Works, the Southern Standard Cotton Press Company and the Progress Manufacturing Company.&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soulelivesteam.com/photosandfacts.html|title=Fact Sheet|publisher=Mississippi Industrial Heritage Museum|accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short of money after his railroad accident, he decided to build his own cotton press for his fledgling cotton gin. The invention was simpler and less expensive than those on the market and attracted wide attention. Soulé called his invention the Southern Standard Cotton Press and founded the company around this machine. In 1881, two years after he moved the business to Meridian, the company sold 750 cotton presses all over the South.&lt;ref name=queenpast/&gt;

In 1886, Soulé sold the Southern Standard Press after founding Progress Manufacturing in 1894, and invented the Ideal Hay-Press for use in the new company.&lt;ref name=mra/&gt; This new business was located on 5th Street between 26th and 27th Avenues and grew to include a [[foundry]] and machine shop. Looking to invent more, he turned over active management to Progress Manufacturing in 1888 and began working on a small rotary engine.&lt;ref name=queenpast/&gt; He sold Progress Manufacturing in 1891 and established Steam Feed Works. The business was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in 1893.&lt;ref name=mra/&gt; In total, Soulé patented over 40 items during his lifetime,&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt; including the Success Cotton Seed Huller and an improved version of the [[sugar mill]].&lt;ref name=mra/&gt;

In 1902, when the new Steam Feed Works had become well-established, Soulé found a country home in [[Santa Rosa County, Florida]]. He began to turn much of the company over to his son, Clyde, and spent more of his time in Florida, before returning to Meridian in 1917, where he stayed until his death on December 21, 1922. During his life he had two wives – Olivia Sherman Warren in 1873 and Constance Gara in 1907, two years after his former wife's death – and nine children.&lt;ref name=queenpast/&gt; One of his grand children, also named [[George Soulé (musician)|George Soulé]], was an influential [[R&amp;B]] songwriter in the 1960s and 70s.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Steam Feed Works==

===Complex===
Soulé Steam Feed Works was originally located at the corner of 25th Avenue and 5th Street.&lt;ref name=queenpast/&gt; The first building built on the company's present lot was built between 1890 and 1892 was formerly the Meridian Candy Factory. After the building was devastated by fire, George Soulé bought it and turned it into a machine shop, assembly area, and office for the up-and-coming business, which would later relocate there. The two-story building's facade was originally brick, but a layer of lime cement [[stucco]] was added in the 1930s, and a second layer was added in the late 1960s. Inside the building is an {{convert|8|ft|adj=on}} x {{convert|12|ft|adj=on}} fireproof vault, which holds the original company records. Above the vault, the company is written in gold. The vault was added after an 1895 fire destroyed George Soulé's office and the records in it.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

[[File:Soulé Machine Shop Annex.JPG|thumb|left|1907 annex, which contained an assembly room upstairs and a blacksmith shop downstairs]]
A second building was added on to the side of the original building in 1907, and the downstairs of the original building was converted into a mill supply store. Belt-driven machines are operated by a {{convert|100|ft|adj=on}} line drive shaft that stretches almost the entire length of the building.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The drive shaft, now the longest operating drive in the country,&lt;ref name=homepage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soulelivesteam.com/home.html|title=Mississippi Industrial Heritage Museum at Soulé Steam Feed Works|publisher=Mississippi Industrial Heritage Museum|accessdate=2010-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; was powered by an electric motor dating from the early 1920s. There is also a [[blacksmith]] shop and two [[forge]]s in the building, both of which are powered by the drive shaft. A belt-driven wooden freight elevator was used to take finished castings to the assembly room upstairs and lower the finished products back downstairs. A system of rails and cranes allowed this heavy machinery and other items to be transported easily to the elevator and throughout the building. The crane system could also move items to the [[foundry]] (built in 1917) and the machine shop, as well as out to the street. There is a steam engine factory on the second floor of the building which contains another {{convert|25|ft|adj=on}} shaft that was driven by the main downstairs shaft. Fans were attached to this smaller shaft to keep the area cool during the summer.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

[[File:Soulé drive belt.jpg|thumb|upright|The drive shaft, which is the longest operating one in the country]]
In October 1907 when the second building was built, Soulé employed 23 people in the foundry department and 23 machinists, making 46 total employees. By May 1917, the total number had dropped to 31 due to the shortage of manpower during [[World War I]], but employee totals increased again after the war, averaging 50 people between 1922 and 1945. Employees were paid an average of 50 to 70 cents per hour – the highest paying jobs in Meridian at the time – and the [[Construction foreman|foreman]] and supervisors would receive a weekly cash [[stipend]] of $7–9. Workers would be on duty six days a week for an average of nine hours per day.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

A third building, the foundry, was added to the complex in 1917, and additions were made from 1923-25. A [[cupola furnace]] that pre-dates the building itself was installed near the western end of the building and used to melt iron until a modern electric furnace was added in the 1970s. Both furnaces still exist in the building, and both can be used at the same time. In 1977 a Vulcan Engineering NoBake System was added. A fourth and fifth building were also added in the 1920s, although they were only used as storage and added no extra manufacturing ability to the complex.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Though during its peak the company produced and shipped many of its products around the world, after [[World War II]], the company focused on the local and regional market. The upstairs of the original 1892 building was converted into storage in the 1950s. Other changes were also made in the latter half of the 20th century, including dividing the office space in the original building into [[cubicle]]s, covering walls with [[Masonite]] board, and covering the floors with sheet [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]]. The Mississippi Industrial Heritage Museum received the title to the building in December 2003 and restored the building largely to its 1920s appearance.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

===Products===
The company is most widely known for serving the lumber industry that boomed from about 1885 to the 1930s. At the turn of the century, steam was the only portable and dependable source of power, and the Soulé Rotary Steam Engine was patented in 1896. The engine was used from 1892 to 1922 to drive [[sawmill]] carriages, which would help feed lumber into a spinning saw blade. The engine could also power [[winch]]es to load and unload logs to and from railroad cars and wagons. A total of 2,300 engines were built at the plant and sold around the world; a few are still in operation in [[Australia]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Other countries in which the engine was sold include [[South Africa]], [[Cuba]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], the [[Philippines]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Peru]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Colombia]].&lt;ref name=queenpast/&gt; Though the engines were touted as "the most durable and easily controlled" engines of the time, they were sometimes referred to as "steam hogs" because lots of steam was required to make them run. Soulé patented an improvement to the rotary engine in 1902, but more improvements were needed to keep up with competition.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soulelivesteam.com/history.html|title=Soulé Steam Feed Works Company History|publisher=Mississippi Industrial Heritage Museum|accessdate=2010-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soulé Spee-D-Twin, a two-cylinder reciprocating steam engine, was designed in 1922 and patented in 1923. Being much more efficient than its predecessor, the Spee-D-Twin became the favorite among sawmill operators. The engine featured a [[valve]] that allowed the engine to operate in both forward and reverse, and its small size allowed it to be retrofitted onto an existing carriage.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; When in full operation, the factory could produce one Spee-D-Twin per day.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt; The company built and sold 4,301 Spee-D-Twins between 1923 and 1984 to people in all fifty states and internationally as well.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Soulé Steam Feed Works also patented the Simplex Automatic Lumber Edge Stacker in 1897, which would automate the process of stacking lumber. The first Edge Stacker was instaled in the mill of Camp &amp; Hinton Company in [[Lumberton, Mississippi]] in July 1895, and more than 100 were installed around the nation. Some notable mills in which Soulé Stackers were instaled include the [[Great Southern Lumber Company]] in [[Bogalusa, Louisiana]]; [[Grays Harbor Commercial Company]] in [[Cosmopolis, Washington]]; and [[Potlatch Lumber Company]] in [[Elk River, Idaho]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Other products manufactured and sold by Soulé Steam Feed Works include the St. Bernard Saw Mill Dog, which would allow mills to extract lumber not only from large logs but from smaller ones as well. A.D. Hunter, an employee of Steam Feed Works, invented a plane-to-plane air refueling device while at work, which was used during [[The Flying Keys|Fred and Al Key]]'s record-breaking endurance flight in 1935. Another employee, David Stephenson, fabricated the aluminum catwalk used during the flight to perform maintenance on the plane.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The 2008 festival attracted nearly 2,000 people from 10 states to downtown Meridian.&lt;ref name=festival2009/&gt; A Watts-Campbell [[Corliss steam engine]], built in 1905, had been offered to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], but they already had one, so it was given to the Mississippi Industrial Heritage Museum and installed during that year.&lt;ref name=festival2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=explore/&gt; The museum also owns the last steam engine ever built by the company.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;

The seventh annual festival in 2009 attracted several thousand visitors from 15 states and one foreign country. The event was also expanded to two days. During the event, the Watts-Campbell Corliss engine acquired in 2008 was demonstrated as well as an 1870 Manchester engine. Other steam engines were also brought in by the public and put on display. A portable sawmill was demonstrated as well.&lt;ref name=homepage/&gt;

Other demonstrations that regularly appear at the festival include blacksmith, broom-making, and pottery wheel demonstrations,&lt;ref name=explore&gt;{{cite news|url=http://meridianstar.com/local/x681139967/Explore-Meridian-s-steamy-past|title=Explore Meridian's 'steamy' past|date=November 1, 2008|author=Ben Lockridge|newspaper=[[The Meridian Star]]|accessdate=2010-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the operation of an antique print shop.&lt;ref name=festival2009/&gt; Most of the displays at the festival have working examples that blow whistles, emit steam, and cut logs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://meridianstar.com/local/x681140527/When-steam-was-king|title=When steam was king|date=November 2, 2008|author=Brian Livingston|newspaper=[[The Meridian Star]]|accessdate=2010-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alabama Art Casting has held annual molten iron pours at Soule until recent years.&lt;ref name=festival2009/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2432">The '''Southern Norway Exhibition''' ({{lang-no|Sørlandsutstillingen}}) is an annual traveling exhibition of [[Norway|Norwegian]] contemporary art. It is open to visual artists from [[Southern Norway]] ([[Vest-Agder]] and [[Aust-Agder]] counties) plus [[Telemark]] county.&lt;ref name="SNL"&gt;[https://snl.no/S%C3%B8rlandsutstillingen ''Store norske leksikon'': Sørlandsutstillingen.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Southern Norway Exhibition opened on January 4, 1969.&lt;ref name="SNL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kristiansen, Alv. 1977. ''Agder''. Oslo: Gyldendal, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was set up at the initiative of the painters [[Bjørn Krogstad]] and [[Øyvind Brune]] in 1968. After making thorough preparations, they contacted the [[Kristiansand Art Association]] ({{lang-no|Christianssands  Kunstforening}}) and by May 1968 had arranged the rules&lt;ref&gt;Reglement for Sørlandsutstillingen. 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; for how the exhibition should be organized and carried out the following year. Among other accomplishments, Krogstad and Brune established an economic foundation for the exhibition by having it included in the budget of the [[Arts Council Norway|Norway Arts Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Ovva (pseudonym). 1969. "Merkedag for sørlandsk kunstliv." ''Fedrelandsvennen'' (January 3).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the statute of the Southern Norway Exhibition, the exhibition's founders are the following:

* The Telemark Visual Artists Association (''Billedkunstnere i Telemark'', BiT) 
* The Agder Norwegian Visual Artists Association (''Norske Billedkunstnere Agder'', NBK-A) 
* The [[Skien Art Association]] (''Skiens Kunstforening'')
* The Arendal Art Association (''Arendal Kunstforening'')
* The Kristiansand Art Association (''Christianssands Kunstforening'')

Other regional exhibitions are the [[Eastern Norway Exhibition]] (''Østlandsutstillingen''), the [[Central Norway Exhibition]] (''Den midtnorske kunstutstilling''), the [[Western Norway Exhibition]] (''Vestlandsutstillingen''), and the [[Northern Norway Exhibition]] (''Den Nord-Norske Kunstutstilling''). These play a strong role in Norway's artistic milieu alongside the annual nationwide [[Høstutstillingen|Autumn Exhibition]] in Oslo.

The '''Spring-Summer 2004 [[Christian Dior S.A.|Christian Dior]] [[haute couture]] collection''' was designed by [[John Galliano]] and presented on January 19, 2004 in [[Paris]]. It was inspired by Galliano's then recent travels to [[Egypt]]. (Ethnic influences are often prominent in Galliano's work.) 
The collection was one of Galliano's most celebrated collections for Dior.&lt;ref&gt;http://travel.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/style/tmagazine/03tgalliano.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection included [[leopard-print]] [[Stole (shawl)|fur stole]]s with [[Collar (clothing)|collar]]s that "soar like [[obelisk]]s", billowing gowns of shadow-dyed [[organza]], with hems twisted and folded into [[lotus flower]] shapes, and pyramid-shaped gowns made of dozens of golden mirrors, and printed with hieroglyphics, or the glamorous [[mummies]] paraded in bandages of black [[Tulle netting|silk tulle]] flashing with rainbow [[sequin]]s. Many wore [[Nefertiti]]-like crowns, or long Egyptian "goatees". The models wore [[Breastplate|breast-plates]] of turquoise, coral, silver and gold, and earrings the size of "eagles' eggs". All models were outfitted in [[corset]]s. The models wore carved and polished wood masks, of [[Tutenkhamun]], or gods like [[Horus]], a falcon, [[Bast (goddess)|Bast]], a cat, or [[Anubis]], a jackal. The masks were made by London milliner [[Stephen Jones (milliner)|Stephen Jones]].

Models in the show included Britain's [[Erin O'Connor]], who opened the collection, Brazil's [[Raquel Zimmermann]] and [[Caroline Trentini]], Sudan-born [[Alek Wek]], the Dutch [[Yfke Sturm]] and the Czech [[Karolína Kurková]], who closed the collection.

"'''The Inquisition'''" is the 32nd and final episode of ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'', a 1960s British [[Supermarionation]] television series created by [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]] and produced by their company [[AP Films#Century 21|Century 21 Productions]]. Written by [[Tony Barwick]] and directed by [[Ken Turner (director)|Ken Turner]], it was first broadcast on 12 May 1968 on [[ATV London]].&lt;ref name="Bentley2008"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bentley|first1=Chris|title=The Complete Gerry Anderson: The Authorised Episode Guide|edition=4th|year=2008|origyear=2001|publisher=Reynolds &amp; Hearn|location=London, UK|isbn=978-1-905287-74-1|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this [[clip show]] episode, [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Blue]] disappears during a night out after unwittingly drinking drugged coffee. Having fallen unconscious, he wakes up on [[Cloudbase]] in front of a Spectrum Intelligence agent, who orders him to prove his identity by revealing classified information. Suspicious of his interrogator's motives, Blue tries to satisfy his demands by describing some of Spectrum's operations against the [[Mysteron]]s, which are then presented as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]].

The episode, which leaves the war between humanity and the Mysterons unresolved,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/anderson/scarlet/intro.shtml|title=''Captain Scarlet'': Introduction|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=16 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120909151638/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/anderson/scarlet/intro.shtml|archivedate=9 September 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; has received a negative response from commentators.&lt;ref name="SangsterCondon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffery"/&gt;

==Plot==
After dining with [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] (voiced by [[Francis Matthews (actor)|Francis Matthews]]) at the Markham Arms restaurant, [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Blue]] (voiced by [[Ed Bishop]]) is served drugged coffee by the [[maitre d']], who unknown to Scarlet and Blue is a [[Mysteron]] agent.&lt;ref name="Bentley2017,202-203"/&gt; After finishing the coffee, Blue falls unconscious and then disappears. Transmitting to Earth, the Mysterons warn Spectrum that a member of the organisation will betray them all.

Blue regains consciousness in what appears to be the [[Cloudbase]] control room facing a man who introduces himself as Colgan, a Spectrum Intelligence agent. Colgan tells Blue that he has been missing for three months and must prove his identity by giving details of Spectrum's top-secret [[Cryptography|cipher codes]]. Reluctant to give away classified information, Blue tries to satisfy Colgan by describing some of Spectrum's operations against the Mysterons. However, his efforts are in vain: his overview of the Mysterons' attempt to destroy London ("[[Big Ben Strikes Again]]") is judged useless and his first-person account of the destruction of their base on the Moon ("[[Crater 101]]") is discounted due to the extensive media coverage of the event. His third example – the attempted assassination of Earth's air force leaders ("[[The Trap (Captain Scarlet)|The Trap]]") – is also rejected even though it was never reported in the press.

Increasingly suspicious of Colgan's interest in the codes, as well as the absence of other Spectrum personnel, Blue attempts to leave the control room but finds his way blocked by a man holding a gun and a hypodermic syringe containing a [[truth serum]]. Realising that Colgan and his associate are Mysteron agents, Blue hurls himself through an observation window and lands on a painted-sky canvas, revealing "Cloudbase" to be a replica built inside an empty [[warehouse]]. Scarlet arrives in a [[Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle]], orders Blue to get clear and destroys the warehouse with the SPV's rocket launcher. Scarlet informs Blue that he went missing only a few hours earlier and suggests that he tell his story "back on the real Cloudbase".

==Production==
''Captain Scarlet'' is one of a number of Supermarionation productions to feature a clip-show [[series finale]], the first of which was ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]]''{{'}}s "Aquanaut of the Year". This practice continued in the Andersons' next three puppet series, ending with ''[[Joe 90]]''{{'}}s "The Birthday".&lt;ref name="Cater"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://networkonair.com/features/2018/06/15/captain-scarlet-and-the-mysterons-how-to-end-a-series/|title=''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons'': How to End a Series ...|last1=Cater|first1=Martin|date=15 June 2018|work=www.networkonair.com|publisher=[[Network Distributing]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729181915/https://networkonair.com/features/2018/06/15/captain-scarlet-and-the-mysterons-how-to-end-a-series/|archivedate=29 July 2018|deadurl=no|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Inquisition" was long planned.&lt;ref name="Cater"/&gt; It was specifically written to exclude scenes from "[[The Mysterons]]", to which there are flashbacks in "[[Winged Assassin]]", "[[Dangerous Rendezvous]]" and "[[Traitor (Captain Scarlet)|Traitor]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2017, p.&amp;nbsp;123.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Frame story|framing scenes]] were shot on Century 21 Studios' Stage 3 between 22 and 25 November 1967 alongside the filming of "[[The Most Special Agent]]", the first episode of ''Joe 90'', on Stage 4.&lt;ref name="Bentley2017,202-203"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2017, p.&amp;nbsp;183.&lt;/ref&gt; The finished episode contains only eight minutes of original footage, with the flashback to "Crater 101" making up another eight minutes of the running time.&lt;ref name="Bentley2017,202-203"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DrakeBassett"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Drake|first1=Chris|last2=Bassett|first2=Graeme|title=Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons|year=1993|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Boxtree]]|location=London, UK|isbn=978-1-852834-03-6|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Markham Arms scene features 20 "revamp" (guest) puppets appearing as background characters.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2017, p.&amp;nbsp;57.&lt;/ref&gt; Blue's escape from the control room was accomplished by throwing the puppet through a sheet of glass onto the backdrop of the control room set;&lt;ref name="DrakeBassett"/&gt; though filmed at high speed, when played in [[slow motion]] a gloved hand can be seen launching the puppet.&lt;ref name="Bentley2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley2001"/&gt; The puppet that plays Colgan was a newly-made copy of revamp puppet 19, which had appeared in various supporting roles in ''Captain Scarlet'' and was making its debut as Sam Loover in ''Joe 90'' while "The Inquisition" was being filmed.&lt;ref name="Bentley2017,202-203"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley2001"/&gt; The copy would also appear in the later series.&lt;ref name="Bentley2017,202-203"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley2001"/&gt;

The exterior of the Markham Arms was designed as a [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]]-style pub by [[Mike Trim]] and built as a [[cardboard]] and [[Perspex]] scale model by [[Alan Shubrook]]. To give the model an aged look, Shubrook used [[sandpaper]] to wear down the walls and applied strokes of dark paint around the windows to give the impression of rain stains. He has described making the Markham Arms as a "typical day's work" in the model-making department during his "early years" at Century 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Century 21 FX: Unseen Untold|last1=Shubrook|first1=Alan|author1-link=Alan Shubrook|year=2007|publisher=Shubrook Bros Publications|isbn=978-0-9556101-0-3|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Music specially recorded for "The Inquisition" includes a [[piano piece]], performed by series composer [[Barry Gray]], which plays during the Markham Arms scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r676346|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Captain Scarlet [Original TV Soundtrack]'' Review|first=Bruce|last=Eder|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|accessdate=16 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529042759/http:/www.allmusic.com/album/captain-scarlet-original-tv-soundtrack-mw0000325049|archivedate=29 May 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Inquisition" is the only episode of ''Captain Scarlet'' in which [[Colonel White]] and Cloudbase (excluding the Mysterons' simulation) do not appear.&lt;ref name="Bentley2001"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bentley|first1=Chris|title=The Complete Book of Captain Scarlet|year=2001|publisher=[[Carlton Books]]|location=London, UK|isbn=978-1-842224-05-2|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast==
After being omitted from the BBC's [[Television network|network]] runs of ''Captain Scarlet'' that began in 1993, "The Inquisition" had its first UK network broadcast on [[BBC 2]] on 9 September 1994.&lt;ref name="Bentley2001"/&gt;

==Reception==
"The Inquisition" has been negatively received by commentators. Anthony Clark of ''sci-fi-online.com'' calls it a "cheap flashback episode".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sci-fi-online.com/2006_Reviews/dvd/06-09-18_CaptainScarlet2Boxset.htm|title=DVD ''Captain Scarlet'' (New) Series 2 Box Set Review|last1=Clark|first1=Anthony|work=sci-fi-online.com|accessdate=16 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216034031/http://www.sci-fi-online.com/2006_Reviews/dvd/06-09-18_CaptainScarlet2Boxset.htm|archivedate=16 February 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan Jeffery of [[Digital Spy]] describes it as a "glorified clip show" that "[provides] no resolution to the series", comparing it negatively to the "thrilling" previous instalment, "[[Attack on Cloudbase]]".&lt;ref name="Jeffery"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/tubetalk/a351455/captain-scarlet-and-the-mysterons-tube-talk-gold.html|title=''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons'': Tube Talk Gold|last1=Jeffery|first1=Morgan|date=19 November 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Communications|Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=16 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120073531/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/tubetalk/a351455/captain-scarlet-and-the-mysterons-tube-talk-gold.html|archivedate=20 November 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Thomas of ''[[Dreamwatch]]'' magazine argues that ''Captain Scarlet''{{'}}s "occasional lack of ideas" leads to an "over-use" of recycled footage, and views "The Inquisition" as the worst case of this. Thomas also criticises Colgan's false interrogation of Blue for being "rather unconvincing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last1=Thomas|first1=Andrew|editor1-last=Leigh|editor1-first=Gary|magazine=[[Dreamwatch]]|title=Captain Indestructible!|volume=1|issue=4 (Winter Special)|year=1994|publisher=Dreamwatch Publishing|location=Brighton, UK|pages=24- 26|issn=1356-482X|oclc=225907941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Drake and Graeme Bassett write that the episode's dependence on flashbacks makes it an "unusual" series finale.&lt;ref name="DrakeBassett"/&gt; Martin Cater of [[Network Distributing]] describes "The Inquisition" as "decidedly downbeat" but considers the episodes re-visited in flashback to be "arguably the three best examples from the series after the [[The Mysterons|pilot]]".&lt;ref name="Cater"/&gt;

Chris Bentley notes that two guest puppets make more than one appearance in the episode. The puppet that plays Shroeder in the flashback to "Crater 101" and the puppet that plays one of the police officers in the flashback to "Big Ben Strikes Again" also have non-speaking roles in both the Markham Arms scene (as the pianist and a patron, respectively) and the extract from "The Trap" (as two of the conference delegates).&lt;ref name="Bentley2017,202-203"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley2001"/&gt; A similar observation is made by Jim Sangster and Paul Condon, authors of ''Collins Telly Guide'', who compare the appearance of the Shroeder puppet to that of actor [[Robert Mitchum]]. Sangster and Condon regard the episode's use of flashbacks as unexciting, noting that they are also used in "Winged Assassin", "Dangerous Rendezvous" and "Traitor".&lt;ref name="SangsterCondon"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collins Telly Guide|last1=Sangster|first1=Jim |last2=Condon|first2=Paul|year=2005|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-007190-99-7|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bentley also points out that the flashback to "Crater 101" alters the established [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of that episode: inside the Mysteron base, Scarlet casts his mind back to a conversation that he had with Controller Linda Nolan at Lunarville 6, prompting the conversation to be replayed as a "[[Story within a story|flashback within a flashback]]".&lt;ref name="Bentley2008"/&gt; Bentley states that this was done to ensure "narrative clarity".&lt;ref name="Bentley2017,202-203"/&gt;

In his review of the CD release of the ''Captain Scarlet'' soundtrack, Andrew Pixley of ''[[TV Zone]]'' magazine names the "sombre" piano piece from "The Inquisition" as one of two standout tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=The ''TV Zone'' Reviews: Merchandise: ''Captain Scarlet: Original Television Soundtrack''|magazine=[[TV Zone]]|last1=Pixley|first1=Andrew|issue=173|date=March 2004|publication-date=February 2004|publisher=[[Visual Imagination]]|location=London, UK|issn=0957-3844|oclc=226121852|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Pellegrina titula.jpg|thumb|280px|First Edition 1589]]
'''''The Pilgrim Woman''''' (''La pellegrina'') is a 1579 play written by [[Girolamo Bargagli]] of [[Siena]] that had been performed for the first time on 2 May 1589 in [[Florence]], after the author's death in 1586, on the occasion of the marriage of [[Ferdinand I de' Medici]], Grand-Duke of Tuscany, with Christine de Lorraine, grand-daughter of the former queen-mother of France, [[Catherine de' Medici]]. This was enhanced with six musical interludes, the {{ill|Intermedi for La pellegrina|de|Intermedien für La pellegrina|lt=''intermedi'' for ''La pellegrina''}}, with designs by [[Bernardo Buontalenti]], known as the master of Florentine spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 545).&lt;/ref&gt; Six then-famous composers from Florence contributed music, including some of the most virtuosic vocal writing of the period, early examples of [[monody]]. The opening aria, ''Dalle piu alte sfere'', is believed to be by [[Emilio de' Cavalieri]] (Palisca, Norton Anthology of Music), although it is sometimes attributed to Antonio Archilei, whose wife Vittoria had sung it in the role of Armonia in the 1589 production. 

The ''intermedi'' have been played by the [[Huelgas Ensemble]], in 1998; by the [http://www.hollandsvocaalensemble.nl/ Hollands Vocaal Ensemble], in 2003; by the Capriccio Stravagante Renaissance Orchestra, in 2007; and, in selections, by Consort Astræa, in 2009. A staged version was mounted in 1989 in [[Minneapolis]] by the Ex Machina Baroque Opera Ensemble. In 2014 the [https://www.early-music.org/ Texas Early Music Project], in Austin, gave the first U.S. performance of the 21st century.

The '''Turks and Caicos Weekly News''', also known as the TC Weekly News, is a weekly [[newspaper]] serving the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]].  It was first published by editor and publisher W Blythe Duncanson in July 1982.

==History==
Turks and Caicos-born Duncanson had previously worked for [[Bahamas|Bahamian]] publications the [[Nassau Tribune]] and the [[Bahamian Review Magazine]] before returning to the T&amp;C Islands in 1981.  Arriving back, he saw the need for a magazine that would promote the unspoilt beauty of the Islands. He decided to set up the Turks and Caicos Current magazine, the first national publication of its kind in the Turks and Caicos.  However, within a year Duncanson was confronted with a number of major [[news]] stories and realised that the Islands had an even greater need for a news publication.

In July 1982, Duncanson released the first edition of the Turks and Caicos Weekly News and shelved his magazine to be re-established at a later date.  In 2007, the Turks and Caicos Weekly News celebrated its 25th [[anniversary]] and remains the "oldest, most reliable and most trustworthy newspaper in the TCI."

The Turks and Caicos Weekly News has published an [[news site|online version]] since August 2007.

'''USS ''George Washington'' (SSBN-598)''' was the United States's first operational [[ballistic missile submarine]].  It was the [[lead ship]] of [[George Washington class submarine|her class]] of nuclear ballistic missile submarines, was the third&lt;ref&gt;Several other U.S. Navy ships have been named {{USS|Washington}} in his honor.&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Navy]] ship of the name, in honor of [[George Washington]] (1732–1799), first President of the United States, and the first of that name to be purpose-built as a warship.

== Construction and launching ==
[[File:USS George Washington (SSBN 589).jpg|thumb|left|''George Washington'' during her launching ceremony in Groton.]]

''George Washington'''s keel was laid down at [[Electric Boat]] Division of [[General Dynamics]], [[Groton, Connecticut]] on 1 November 1958. The first of [[George Washington class submarine|her class]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|year=1959|title=Connecticut, 1959/06/11 (1959)|url=https://archive.org/details/1959-06-11_Connecticut|publisher=[[Universal Newsreel]]|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 9 June 1959 sponsored by Mrs. Ollie Mae Anderson (née Rawlins), wife of US Treasury Secretary Robert B. Anderson, and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 30 December 1959 as SSBN-598&lt;ref name="Adcock, p.12"/&gt; with [[Commander]] James B. Osborn in command of the Blue crew and Commander John L. From, Jr. in command of the Gold crew.

''George Washington'' was originally laid down as the [[attack submarine]] {{USS|Scorpion|SSN-589}}. During construction, she was lengthened by the insertion of a {{convert|130|ft|m|abbr=on}}-long ballistic missile section and renamed '''''George Washington'''''; another submarine under construction at the time received the original name and [[Hull number#United States military|hull number]]. Inside ''George Washington'''s forward escape hatch, a plaque remained bearing her original name. Because the ballistic missile compartment design of ''George Washington'' was intended to be reused in later ship classes, the section inserted into ''George Washington'' was designed with a deeper [[test depth]] rating than the rest of the submarine.

==Initial operations==
[[File:1960-07-21 First Polaris Firing By Submerged U-Boat.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=57|left|Universal International Newsreel of first submerged Polaris firing on 20 July 1960]]

''George Washington'' left Groton on 28 June 1960 for [[Cape Canaveral, Florida]], where she loaded two [[Polaris missile]]s. Standing out into the [[Eastern Range|Atlantic Missile Test Range]] with [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[William Raborn]], head of the Polaris submarine development program, on board as an observer, she successfully conducted the first Polaris missile launch from a submerged submarine on 20 July 1960. At 12:39, ''George Washington'''s commanding officer sent President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] the message:
&lt;tt&gt;POLARIS - FROM OUT OF THE DEEP TO TARGET. PERFECT.&lt;/tt&gt; 
Less than two hours later a second missile from the submarine also struck the impact area {{convert|1100|nmi|mi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} downrange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/history/chrono.html |work=[[Chief of Naval Operations]] |publisher=Submarine Warfare Division |title=Submarine Chronology |date=3 March 2001 |accessdate=22 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006174141/http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/history/chrono.html |archivedate=6 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''George Washington'' then embarked her Gold crew, and on 30 July 1960 she launched two more missiles while submerged. Shakedown for the Gold crew ended at Groton on 30 August and the boat got underway from that port on 28 October for [[Charleston, South Carolina|Naval Weapons Station Charleston]], to load her full complement of 16&amp;nbsp;Polaris missiles. There she was awarded the [[Navy Unit Commendation]], after which her Blue crew took over and embarked on her first deterrent patrol.

The submarine completed her first patrol after 66&amp;nbsp;days of submerged running on 21 January 1961, and put in at [[Naval Submarine Base New London]] at [[New London, Connecticut]]. The Gold crew took over and departed on her next patrol on 14 February 1961. After the patrol, she entered [[Holy Loch]], [[Scotland]], on 25 April 1961.

In 1970 ten years after her initial departure from Groton, ''George Washington'' put in to refuel in Charleston SC, having cruised some {{convert|100000|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}}.

''George Washington'' shifted to the [[United States Pacific Fleet]] and a new [[home port]] at [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii after the refueling.

==Collision with ''Nissho Maru''==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
On 9 April 1981, ''George Washington'' was at periscope depth and was broadsided by the {{convert|2350|LT|t|lk=on|abbr=on}} Japanese commercial [[cargo ship]] ''Nissho Maru'' in the [[East China Sea]] about {{convert|110|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} south-southwest of [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]], Japan. ''George Washington'' immediately surfaced and searched for the other vessel. Owing to the heavy fog conditions at the time, they did see the Nissho Maru heading off into the fog, but it appeared undamaged. After calling out for a P-3 Orion to search for the freighter, they headed into port for repairs; the crew was later flown back to Pearl Harbor from Guam. Unbeknownst to the crew of the George Washington, ''Nissho Maru'' sank in about 15&amp;nbsp;minutes. Two Japanese crewmen were lost; 13 were rescued by [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] ''AkiGumo[[:ja:あきぐも|(ja)]]'' and ''Aogumo[[:ja:あおぐも|(ja)]].'' The submarine suffered minor damage to her [[Sail (submarine)|sail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Connell|first=John F.|title=For Want of a Timely Call ...|journal=Naval Warfare College Review|date=Winter 2013|volume=66|issue=1|pages=101–109|url=http://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/9a2f8642-a752-4a2a-906f-58c8f5f5fe3c/For-Want-of-a-Timely-Call--Commentary-essay-.aspx|accessdate=14 November 2013|publisher=Naval Warfare College|location=Newport, RI|format=PDF|issn=0028-1484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accident strained U.S.–Japanese relations a month before a meeting between [[Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Zenko Suzuki]] and President of the United States [[Ronald Reagan]]. Japan criticized the U.S. for taking more than 24&amp;nbsp;hours to notify Japanese authorities, and demanded to know what the boat was doing surfacing only about {{convert|20|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} outside Japan's territorial waters. 

The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] initially stated that ''George Washington'' executed a crash dive during the collision, and then immediately surfaced, but could not see the Japanese ship due to fog and rain (according to a  U.S. Navy report). A preliminary report released a few days later stated the submarine and aircraft crews both had detected ''Nissho Maru'' nearby, but neither the submarine nor the aircraft realized ''Nissho Maru'' was in distress.

On 11 April, President Reagan and other U.S. officials formally expressed regret over the accident, made offers of compensation, and reassured the Japanese there was no cause for worry about radioactive contamination. As is its standard policy, the U.S. Government refused to reveal what the submarine was doing close to Japan, or whether she was armed with nuclear missiles. (It is government and navy policy to neither confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons on board.) The Navy accepted responsibility for the incident, and relieved and reprimanded the ''George Washington''{{'}}s [[commanding officer]] and [[officer of the deck]].

On 31 August, the U.S. Navy released its final report, concluding the accident resulted from a set of coincidences, compounded by errors on the part of two members of the submarine crew. 

After the collision with the Nissho Maru, the damaged sail was repaired with parts from the sail from the {{USS|Abraham Lincoln|SSBN-602|6}} which was waiting for disposal at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.

==Final patrol as ballistic missile submarine==
In 1982, ''George Washington'' returned to [[Pearl Harbor]] from her last missile patrol. In 1983, her missiles were unloaded at [[Naval Base Kitsap|Bangor, Washington]] to comply with the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks#SALT I|SALT I]] treaty.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

''George Washington'' made 55 deterrent patrols in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in her 25-year career.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Service as an attack submarine==
''George Washington''  continued service as an attack submarine (SSN), returning briefly to Pearl Harbor. In 1983, she departed Pearl Harbor for the last time and transited the [[Panama Canal]] back to the Atlantic and to New London.

==Decommissioning==
''George Washington'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] on 24 January 1985, stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Registry]] on 30 April 1986, and scheduled for disposal through the [[Ship-Submarine Recycling Program]] at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]]. Recycling of the ship was completed on 30 September 1998.

==Commemoration==
''George Washington'''s [[Sail (submarine)|sail]] was removed prior to disposal and now rests at the [[Submarine Force Library and Museum]] at [[Groton, Connecticut]].

The summit hosts more than 150 participants presenting invited and submitted talks, poster sessions and scientific-outreach talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/512468|title=Successful Inauguration of the World Summit on Evolution 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called "The Woodstock of Evolution"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shermer |first=Michael |date=27 June 2005 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-woodstock-of-evolutio&amp;page=1|title=The Woodstock of Evolution|work=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing together experts and students from widely different areas of evolutionary biology that rarely meet. It has attracted researchers working on [[evolution]] from over 15 different countries, including [[Peter and Rosemary Grant]], [[Niles Eldredge]], [[Antonio Lazcano]], [[Douglas Futuyma]], [[Lynn Margulis]], [[Ada Yonath]], [[William H. Calvin]] and [[Daniel Dennett]].

[[File:Tree of life with genome size.svg|thumb|right|Tree of Life]]
* Join experts from different branches of evolutionary biology to discuss on the impacts of recent discoveries in order to integrate them inside the basic concepts of evolution.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Through a series of presentations and discussions the participants ask the big questions: What is the evidence for the theory of evolution? How has each field and their respective approaches deepened our understating? And where are the future horizons? Bringing together international experts and students for debate helps to answer these questions and hopefully lead to decisions that will shape the direction of evolutionary science in the foreseeable future.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Remind the scientific community of the importance of the Galapagos Islands and the discoveries produced thanks to their particular natural resources. Present the islands as a living and dynamic laboratory of evolution.
* Promote [[Ecuador]], its research community and its academic institutions.

The World Summit on Evolution takes place at Galapagos Academic Institute for the Arts and Sciences (GAIAS), part of the [[Universidad San Francisco de Quito]]. GAIAS was established in 2002 at the capital town of the Galapagos province, Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, on the island of San Cristobal, one of the largest of the [[Galapagos Islands]].

Its 4.5 hectare campus is the only one located on the historically significant Galapagos islands. GAIAS was founded on the principle that would become a first-rate institution for international students and researchers.

The Galapagos Islands inspired [[Charles Darwin]] to define his evolutionary theory, which revolutionized human understanding in relation to the diversity of species, including humans. His ideas were presented in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.

The Galapagos Islands, are important for the scientific studies that have been developed over the centuries after his visit.

=== 9–12 June 2005 - First World Summit on Evolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usfq.edu.ec/evo/new1.htm |accessdate=August 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820044338/http://www.usfq.edu.ec/evo/new1.htm |archivedate=August 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

=== 22–26 August 2009 - Second World Summit on Evolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wse2.usfq.edu.ec/ |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620000510/http://wse2.usfq.edu.ec/ |archivedate=June 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
The Second World Summit on Evolution was launched to celebrate Charles Darwin's 200th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darwinday.org/events/listing.php?id=12512 Darwin Day Celebration Events]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 summit included the first meeting of the Sociedad Iberoamericana de Biologia Evolutiva (SIBE). SIBE led to the establishment of academic and intellectual bonds between the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking specialists in evolutionary biology.

=== 1–5 June 2013 - Third World Summit on Evolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usfq.edu.ec/eventos/evosummit/Paginas/default.aspx|title=III World Summit on Evolution                        - Universidad San Francisco de Quito|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/natureevents/science/events/17949-The_III_World_Summit_on_Evolution|title=Natureevents Directory: Science Events - The III World Summit on Evolution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
The summit adopted the theme ‘Why Does Evolution Matter’. 200-attendees met, to listen to 12 keynote speakers, 20 oral presentations and 31 posters by faculty, postdocs and graduate and undergraduate students. The Summit encompassed five sessions: evolution and society, pre-cellular evolution and the RNA world, behavior and environment, genome, and microbes and diseases. USFQ and GAIAS launched officially the Lynn Margulis Center for Evolutionary Biology and showcased the Galapagos Science Center, developed in partnership with the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].&lt;ref name="GWESIII"&gt;{{cite web|title=Galapagos III world evolution summit: why evolution matters|url=http://www.evolution-outreach.com/content/pdf/1936-6434-6-28.pdf|publisher=Evolution: Education and Outreach| author= Paz-y-Miño-C G. &amp; Espinosa  A. 2013.|pages=6:28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
