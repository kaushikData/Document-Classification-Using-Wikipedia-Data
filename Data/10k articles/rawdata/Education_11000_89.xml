==History==
The original format of 23 Things required participants to take part in an eight-and-a-half-week course where they kept up with coursework via a series of weekly blog posts that described Web 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hemment|first1=Drew|last2=Thompson|first2=Bill|last3=de Vincente|first3=Jose Luis|last4=Cooper|first4=Rachel|title=Digital Public Spaces|date=2013|publisher=Future Everything|isbn=9780956895851|pages=20–21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o3ULz7m1f3UC&amp;pg=RA1-PA2000&amp;dq=%2223+Things%22+blowers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V_MIVfC8LYuigwSMjoPgBw&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%2223%20Things%22%20blowers&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time participants were given 23 assignments (23 things) and were encouraged to work with other learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bozarth|first1=Jane|title=Techniques for Enhancing and Extending Learning|date=2010|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-87766-1|pages=84–85, 91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xiWi4fuOOl0C&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%2223+Things%22+blowers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V_MIVfC8LYuigwSMjoPgBw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%2223%20Things%22%20blowers&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the project was non-mandatory, participants took part in the coursework by posting their own blog entries for each week's coursework. The project was so successful that Blower held a 23 Things summit in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergmann|first1=Julia|last2=Danowski|first2=Patrick|title=Handbuch Bibliothek 2.0|date=2010|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=9783110232103|page=357|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SpD-kVaDVSwC&amp;pg=PA357&amp;dq=%2223+Things%22+blowers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V_MIVfC8LYuigwSMjoPgBw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%2223%20Things%22%20blowers&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception 23 Things has had over 500 iterations and the concept has broadened over time to include learning programs for other professionals and students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilkinson|first1=L|last2=Cragg|first2=E|title=23 Things Oxford|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/38632|publisher=SCONUL Focus|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gwyer|first1=Roisin|last2=Stubbings|first2=Ruth|last3=Walton|first3=Graham|title=The Road to Information Literacy: Librarians as facilitators of learning|date=2012|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=3110281015|page=235|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arrQAVi0SzoC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=%2223+Things%22+blowers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V_MIVfC8LYuigwSMjoPgBw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%2223%20Things%22%20blowers&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also expanded to include more than 23 topics. 23 Things has also expanded beyond the United States and is currently used in multiple countries including [[Australia]] and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IFLA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stephens|first1=Michael|title="23 Things" as Transformative Learning|url=http://conference.ifla.org/past-wlic/2012/150-stephens-en.pdf|publisher=IFLA|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, "23 Things"is a term used to describe a Web immersion experience for participants primarily supported by the participants themselves, where they are actively involved in a network of peers and colleagues, using digital communication tools, and using a blog to post reflections as they learn.&lt;ref name=cp /&gt;

==Research==
In 2012 [[San Jose State University]] assistant professor Michael Stephens performed a research study of 23 Things programs in Australia. He found that even if people did not successfully complete the program, that the program still had the potential to positively impact library staff as the participants would still be likely to use what they did learn and/or to return to the program at a later date.&lt;ref name=IFLA /&gt; Stephens also noted that a strong majority of those who completed said they felt confident exploring and using new technologies: confidence and curiosity were identified as particularly notable outcomes.&lt;ref name=IFLA /&gt;

ABC-CLIO provides service to fifteen different online databases which contain over one million online textbooks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.eschoolnews.com/2015/04/02/free-resources-april-186/|title = Database Offers 1 Million Free Resources and Images in April|last = |first = |date = 2 April 2015|work = eSchool News|access-date = 8 May 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company consults academic leaders in the fields they cover in order to provide authority for their reference titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.booklistonline.com/Encyclopedia-Update-Reboot-2012-Rebecca-Vnuk/pid=5671157|title = Encyclopedia Update: Reboot, 2012|last = Vnuk|first = Rebecca|date = 15 September 2012|journal = Booklist|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 8 May 2015|issue = 2|volume = 109|issn = 0006-7385|pages = 52–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters are located in [[Santa Barbara, California]].

==History==
&lt;!-- Company's formation --&gt;
ABC-CLIO was founded in 1953 as a privately held corporation by Eric Boehm with its first publication, ''[[Historical Abstracts]]''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20010423/40175-e-books-a-natural-for-abc-clio.html|title = E-books a natural for ABC-CLIO|last = Costello|first = Megan|date = 2 April 2001|journal = Publishers Weekly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 26 November 2016|volume = 248|issue = 14|pages = 28–29|issn = 0000-0019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name represents the company's two original divisions when it incorporated in 1969: ABC stands for American Bibliographical Center and CLIO Press is named after [[Clio]], the muse of history from ancient Greek mythology. According to Boehm, he had always been interested in history so when he noticed that there were not many good historical abstracting services available, he started publishing the ''Historical Abstracts''.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-68875009.html|title = ABC-CLIO Stresses Customer-Based Products|last = Hane|first = Paula J.|date = January 2001|journal = Information Today|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 8 May 2015|subscription = yes|volume = 18|issue = 1|issn = 8755-6286|page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Product timeline --&gt;
During the 1960s, a sister bibliographic and abstract publication on American history was added, ''America: History and Life'', which was considered an award-winning title. The company entered into digital publishing with electronic data in the 1960s and in 1975, it published its first online database&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; called ''DIALOG''. During the 1980s, ABC-CLIO expanded into providing primary reference books such as encyclopedias and dictionaries and stopped publishing bibliographic books.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In the 1990s, ABC-CLIO began to provide access to its humanities database on CD-ROM. The ''Exegy Current Events'' CD-ROM was named "Best Disc of the Year" by Library Journal.&lt;ref name=abc-clio&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/About.aspx|title = History and Mission|accessdate = 26 November 2016|publisher = ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, ABC-CLIO provided electronic access to ''America: History and Life''. By the 2000s, one of the company's most popular products had become online databases for researching many topics in the field of the humanities. In 2001, ABC-CLIO began to publish eBooks, initially providing 150 different titles to schools and libraries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The company's reference books had won numerous awards, and the company started a series of subject-related online databases for secondary school use. In 2004, the company acquired the quarterly historical journal, ''[[Journal of the West]]'', which has been published since 1962.&lt;ref name=abc-clio/&gt;

'''Ace Centre''' (previously  '''ACE Centre''' (Aiding Communication in Education), ACE Centre North) provides support for people with complex communications difficulties. Ace Centre offer assessment, training and information services across England, with a focus on Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) and Assistive Technology (AT). AThe ACE Centre have two offices are based in [[Oldham]] and Abingdon, and provide assessment services to [[England and Wales]] and are non-profit making independent organisation with charitable status.

== Brief outline ==
Ace Centre is a registered charity (No. 1089313) providing support for people with complex communications difficulties. 

== Foundation ==

The first ACE Centre was started in 1984 through UK government funding as part of the new initiative to introduce information technology into schools in England and Wales following the end of the Micro-Electronics Project MEP.  During MEP four [[Special education|Special Education]] Micro-technology Resource Centres (SEMERCs) were set up in London (Redbridge), Manchester, Bristol and Newcastle. A special education [[Software engineering|software development]] centre was also established in Manchester.  It was felt that those pupils with severe language or physical disabilities required more specialist support.

This idea for the first ACE centre to support these students came from Tim Southgate (Head of Ormerod Special School) and Prue Fuller, a teacher at the school. They were inspired by the computer research of Patrick Poon at the school. The original staff at the opening of the Centre in May 1984 were Prue Fuller (Director), Andrew Lysley (SEN Teacher), David Colven (Technical Officer) and Pauline Paine (Administrator).  The Centre was managed by Mary Hope at MESU, a post that was later taken over by Tina Detheridge now of Wigit Software.

It was essentially a project under the management of MESU (Micro Electronics Support Unit) a government quango which later merged with CET (Centre for [[Educational technology|Educational Technology]]) to become NCET (the National Centre for Educational Technology). This eventually became Becta (British Educational Communications and Technology Agency) in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;ACE Centre: [http://www.ace-centre.org.uk/index.cfm?pageid=12D0CFAF-3048-7290-FE61D857018897C3 History of the ACE Centre]. (Source for part of the "Founcation" section.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 a second Centre was opened in [[Oldham]]  at Park Dean School It was managed by the head teacher Rhys Williams, who later became principal of Hereward College, and Roger Bates (now of Inclusive Technology).  The first Director proper of ACE Oldham as it was then was Steve Broadbent.  The two Centres in Oldham and Oxford service the north and south of England and Wales respectively.

== History ==

'''Location'''
The ACE Center was housed in a spare classroom at Ormerod special school in [[Headington|Headington, Oxford]] .  Later it moved to temporary buildings on the same site and remained there until the new 'Wooden Spoon' building was erected on [[Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre]] site in 1998.  The new 'Wooden Spoon' building was largely funded by the Wooden Spoon Society&lt;ref&gt;Wooden Spoon: [http://www.woodenspoon.com/projects/project_history.php?sortd=wspoon_commitment&amp;includeref=dynamic Project History].&lt;/ref&gt; and was officially opened by [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] in April 1999. The new building has custom build facilities for assessment and training.

'''Staff'''
It has occupational therapists, speech and language Therapists, special needs and mainstream teachers, assistive technology specialists and support staff.  Early members of staff were Caroline Gray ([[occupational therapist]]), Gillian Hazell (the Nelms, Speech and Language Therapist) and Mark Saville (web page and publications creator).

Prue Fuller retired as director in 1999 and was later awarded an MBE for her services to Assistive and Alternative Communication.  She was also bi-annual president of ISAAC 1998 - 2000.  Caroline Grey became director of the ACE Centre following Prue's retirement until she retired in 2007.  Liz Tapper took over as temporary director until September 2008 and Dr Ben Janubi has been in post since January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;ACE Centre: [http://www.ace-centre.org.uk/index.cfm?pageid=CC3AA672-3048-7290-FE03DC64593E3CD8 Staff Profiles] (incomplete source).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The CAP Project''' This was a government initiative to boost the support and provision of communication aids to school students.&lt;ref&gt;Teach Training Resource Bank: [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100605151523/http://www.ttrb.ac.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?anchorId=17790&amp;selectedId=18229&amp;menu=17837&amp;ContentId=13930 Evaluation of the Communication Aids Project].&lt;/ref&gt;  The ACE Centres were two of the organisations involved with assessment for this project.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  It initially had a two-year timetable and a £10M budget but was extended for a further two years on the same funding basis. During this time the staffing in the centre increased considerably to cope with the assessment demand.

== Software developments ==
The first software developments at the ace centre was to re-write Sentence Scan and Start-Write for the increasingly popular [[BBC Micro]].  Sentence scan was a switch or keyboard accessible sentence builder with speech support.  Sentences could be built up from sets of stored words or phrases.  Start-Write was a letter/keyboard based program with speech support and sophisticated user support configurations.  Staff from the Centre also contributed to the design of the programs such as 'Prompt Writer' and 'Concept', being created by the Special Needs Software Centre based at the Manchester SEMERC managed by Dave King.

The advent of the [[IBM PC compatible|IBM compatible]] computer lead to more graphics based programs being developed for switch users such as 'Plocka' (Swedish for 'pick up').  Plocka has facilities for creating sorting and matching scenarios for switch users and has a built in [[graphics library]].

* AccessMaths is a program developed for students that need to create geometric drawings but cannot manipulate a mouse. Users can use a laptop keyboard only to produce accurate and detailed mathematical constructions and drawings. Switch users can also manipulate the program via programs like 'The Grid 2' and 'SAW' (see below). It was originally developed on the BBC Master computer but later versions were created for use in [[Microsoft Windows|Windows 3]] and later.  The current version is version 4 which is available in English, Swedish and French.  Number Navigator is also a maths based utility which enables students to do 'sums' within a formatted grid.
* SAW (Special Access to Windows) is a program that was created from a grant from the then [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] to enable switch users to manipulate mathematical equations on screen.  It was quickly realised that creating a programmable scanning on-screen keyboard for Windows (version 3 at the time,) the full functionality of what they were hoping to create - and much more - could be realised by using other programs such as 'MathType'.  These programmable on-screen keyboards (selection sets) are now available for a number of very different applications.  SAw 5 is now an [[Open-source software|open source]] program available from the [[OATS|Oatsoft web site]].
* Hotspots - This program has similar user characteristics to SAW, but is designed for [[Point-and-click|point and click]] environments.  In addition to scanning user defined spots on the screen it can annotate these with sounds, images and text.  It is easy to make simple software switch accessible.

== Publications ==
The Ace Centre has published a number of reviews, guides, and 'how to' documents over the years. as well as contributing articles to conferences and [[peer review]]ed journals.  The main forum for disseminating out work is increasingly through the web site but they regularly give papers at conferences including the ISAAC conference,  Communication Matters, AAATE and others.

== Research and projects ==
Ace Centre works with companies, universities and other charities to:
* Investigate health and education issues for children and adults with complex disabilities
* Support companies to trial new products and develop progressive technology
* Find solutions for an individual or a sector
Research and development projects enhance achievement and good practice in the field; directly, through the development of AT &amp;  AAC, and indirectly through awareness raising, skills building and informing government policy. Service-users with communication disabilities are involved throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://acecentre.org.uk/services/research/|title=Research {{!}} Ace Centre|work=Ace Centre|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18577">'''Academic achievement''' or '''(academic) performance''' is the extent to which a student, teacher or institution has achieved their short or long-term educational goals. Cumulative [[GPA]] and completion of educational benchmarks such as secondary school diplomas and bachelor's degrees represent academic achievement.

Academic achievement is commonly measured through [[Test (assessment)|examinations]] or [[continuous assessment]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s but there is no general agreement on how it is best evaluated or which aspects are most important—[[procedural knowledge]] such as [[skill]]s or [[declarative knowledge]] such as [[fact]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Educational Measurement |author1=Annie Ward |author2=Howard W. Stoker |author3=Mildred Murray-Ward |chapter=Achievement and Ability Tests - Definition of the Domain |pages=2–5 |volume=2 |publisher=University Press of America |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-7618-0385-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are inconclusive results over which individual factors successfully predict academic performance, elements such as test anxiety, environment, motivation, and emotions require consideration when developing models of school achievement. Now, schools are receiving money based on its students academic achievements. A school with more academic achievements would receive more money than a school with less achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/757106093|title=Test anxiety: The state of the art|last=Ziedner|first=Mosche|publisher=Plenum Press|year=1998|isbn=9780306471452|location=New York: New York|pages=259|oclc=757106093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, the achievement of schools is measured by the [[Academic Performance Index (California public schools)|Academic Performance Index]].

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students with higher mental ability as demonstrated by [[IQ tests]] and those who are higher in [[conscientiousness]] (linked to effort and achievement motivation) tend to achieve highly in academic settings. A recent meta-analysis suggested that mental curiosity (as measured by [[typical intellectual engagement]]) has an important influence on academic achievement in addition to intelligence and conscientiousness.&lt;ref name="3rdpillar" /&gt;

Children's semi-structured home learning environment transitions into a more structured learning environment when children start first grade.

Highly educated parents tend to have more stimulating learning environments.&lt;ref name="Magnuson 1497–1512"/&gt; Further, recent research indicates that the relationship quality with parents will influence the development of academic self-efficacy among adolescent-aged children, which will in turn affect their academic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fam|first1=J.

Children's first few years of life are crucial to the development of language and social skills. School preparedness in these areas help students adjust to academic expectancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lassiter|first=Kerry|title=The Relationship Between Young Children's Academic Achievement and Measures of Intelligence|journal=Psychology in the Schools|date=July 1995|volume=32|pages=170–177|doi=10.1002/1520-6807(199507)32:3&lt;170::aid-pits2310320303&gt;3.0.co;2-k}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect evidence suggests that physical activity could affect academic achievement. Studies have shown that physical activity can increase neural activity in the brain.&lt;ref name="Tomporowski 2008 111–131"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tomporowski|first=Phillip|author2=Catherin Davis|author3=Patricia Miller|author4=Jack Naglieri|title=Exercise and Children's Intelligence, Cognition and Academic Achievement|journal=Educational Psychology|year=2008|volume=20|issue=2|pages=111–131|doi=10.1007/s10648-007-9057-0|pmc=2748863}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exercise specifically increases [[executive brain]] functions such as [[attention span]] and [[working memory]].&lt;ref name="Tomporowski 2008 111–131"/&gt;

=== Non-cognitive factors ===
Non-cognitive factors or skills, are a set of "attitudes, behaviors, and strategies" that promotes academic and professional success,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutman|first=Leslie|last2=Schoon|first2=Ingrid|date=2013|title=The Impact of non-cognitive skills on outcomes for young people|url=https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/EEF_Lit_Review_Non-CognitiveSkills.pdf|journal=Education Endowment Foundation|volume=|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as academic self-efficacy, self-control,  motivation, expectancy and goal setting theories, emotional intelligence, and determination. To create attention on factors other than those measured by cognitive test scores sociologists Bowles and Gintis coined the term in the 1970s. The term serves as a distinction of cognitive factors, which are measured by teachers through tests and quizzes. Non-cognitive skills are increasingly gaining popularity because they provide a better explanation for academic and professional outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heckman|first=James|last2=Stixrud|first2=Jora|last3=Urzua|first3=Sergio|title=The Effects of Cognitive and Noncognitive Abilities on Labor Market Outcomes and Social Behavior |journal=[[Journal of Labor Economics]] |year=2006 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=411–482 |doi=10.1086/504455 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Self-efficacy ====
Self-efficacy is one of the best predictors of academic success&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stajković |first1=Alexander |last2=Bandura |first2=Albert |last3=Locke |first3=Edwin |last4=Lee |first4=Dongseop |last5=Sergent |first5=Kayla |title=Test of three conceptual models of influence of the big five personality traits and self-efficacy on academic performance: A meta-analytic path-analysis |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=January 2018 |volume=120 |pages=238-245}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Self-efficacy is the belief you can do something. Stajković et others looked at the Big Five traits on academic success as well and saw that conscientiousness and emotional stability were predictors of self-efficacy in over half of their analyses. However, self-efficacy was more indicative of academic performance than personality in all of the analyses. This suggests that parents who want their children to have academic achievement can look to increase their child's sense of self-efficacy at school.

==== Motivation ====
[[Motivation]]&amp;nbsp;is the reasoning behind an individual's actions. Research has found that students with higher academic performance, motivation and persistence use intrinsic goals rather than extrinsic ones.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, students who are motivated to improve upon their previous or upcoming performance tend to perform better academically than peers with lower motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Barry A.|last2=Mandel|first2=Rhonda G.|date=2011-08-12|title=Motivation Predictors of College Student Academic Performance and Retention|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2190/CS.13.1.a|journal=Journal of College Student Retention: Research, Theory &amp; Practice|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.2190/cs.13.1.a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, students with higher need for achievement have greater academic performance.Bad dietary habits can create the disadvantage of a lack of motivation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Downes |first=Loureen |date= |title=Physical Activity and Dietary Habits of College Students |journal=Journal for Nurse Practitioners |volume= 11| issue =2 |year=2015 |pages=192–198 |doi=10.1016/j.nurpra.2014.11.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Self-control ====
[[Self-control]], in the academic setting, is related self-discipline, self-regulation, delay of gratification and impulse control. Baumeister, Vohs, and Tice defined self-control as "the capacity for altering one's own responses, especially to bring them into line with standards such as ideals, values, morals, and social expectations, and to support the attainment of long-term goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baumeister|first=Roy F.|last2=Vohs|first2=Kathleen D.|last3=Tice|first3=Dianne M.|date=December 1, 2007|title=The Strength Model of Self-Control|url=|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=16| issue =  6|pages=351–355}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, self-control is the ability to prioritize long-term goals over the temptation of short-term impulses. Self-control is usually measured through self completed questionnaires. Researchers often use the Self-Control Scale developed by Tangney, Baumeister, &amp; Boone in 2004.

Through a longitudinal study of the [[Stanford marshmallow experiment|marshmallow test]], researchers found a relationship between the time spent waiting for the second marshmallow and higher academic achievement. However, this finding only applied for participants who had the marshmallow in plain site and were placed without any distraction tactics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

High locus of control, where an individual attributes success to personal decision making and positive behaviors such as discipline, is a ramification of self-control. High locus of control has been found to have a positive predictive relationship with high collegiate GPA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hannon|first=Brenda Ann Marie|date=2014-08-18|title=Predicting College Success: The Relative Contributions of Five Social/Personality Factors, Five Cognitive/Learning Factors, and SAT Scores|url=http://redfame.com/journal/index.php/jets/article/view/451|journal=Journal of Education and Training Studies|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=46–58|doi=10.11114/jets.v2i4.451|issn=2324-8068|pmc=4283774|pmid=25568884}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

=== Extracurricular activities ===
Organized [[Extracurricular activity|extracurricular activities]] have yielded a positive relationship with high academic performance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abruzzi|first=Kristen J.|last2=Lenis|first2=Cristina|last3=Romero|first3=Yansi V.|last4=Maser|first4=Kevin J.|last5=Morote|first5=Elsa-Sofia|date=Spring 2016|title=Does Participation in Extracurricular Activities Impact Student Achievement?|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1097547|journal=Journal for Leadership and Instruction|volume=15 n1|pages=21–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; including increasing attendance rates, school engagement, GPA, postsecondary education, as well as a decrease in drop out rates and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Darling|first=Nancy|date=2005-10-01|title=Participation in Extracurricular Activities and Adolescent Adjustment: Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Findings|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-005-7266-8|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|language=en|volume=34|issue=5|pages=493–505|doi=10.1007/s10964-005-7266-8|issn=0047-2891}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, positive developmental outcomes have been found in youth that engage in organized extracurricular activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mahoney|first=Caroline R.|last2=Taylor|first2=Holly A.|last3=Kanarek|first3=Robin B.|last4=Samuel|first4=Priscilla|date=2005-08-07|title=Effect of breakfast composition on cognitive processes in elementary school children|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938405002283|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=85|issue=5|pages=635–645|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2005.06.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; High school athletics have been linked with strong academic performance, particularly among urban youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yeung|first=Ryan|date=2013-07-23|title=Athletics, Athletic Leadership, and Academic Achievement|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0013124513495277|journal=Education and Urban Society|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=361–387|doi=10.1177/0013124513495277}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, involvement in athletics has been linked to increased alcohol consumption and abuse for high school students along with increased truancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eccles|first=Jacquelynne S.|last2=Templeton|first2=Janice|date=2002|title=Extracurricular and Other After-School Activities for Youth|jstor=3568144|journal=Review of Research in Education|volume=26|pages=113–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While research suggests that there is a positive link between academic performance and participation in extracurricular activities, the practice behind this relationship is not always clear. Moreover, there are many unrelated factors that influence the relationship between academic achievement and participation in extracurricular activities (Mahoney et al., 2005). These variables include: civic engagement, identity development, positive social relationships and behaviors, and mental health (Mahoney et al., 2005). In other research on youth, it was reported that positive social support and development, which can be acquired through organized after school activities is beneficial for achieving academic success (Eccles &amp; Templeton, 2002). In terms of academic performance there are a whole other group of variables to consider. Some of these variables include: demographic and familial influences, individual characteristics, and program resources and content (Mahoney et al., 2005). For example, socio-economic status has been found to plays a role in the number of students participating in extracurricular activities (Covay &amp; Carbonaro, 2010). Furthermore, it is suggested that the peer relationships and support that develop in extracurricular activities often affect how individuals perform in school (Eccles &amp; Templeton, 2002). With all these variables to consider it is important to create a better understanding how academic achievement can be seen in both a negative and positive light.

In conclusion, most research suggests that extracurricular activities are positively correlated to academic achievement (Mahoney et al., 2005). It has been mentioned that more research could be conducted to better understand the direction of this relationship (Eccles &amp; Templeton, 2002). Together this information can give us a better understand the exact aspects to consider when considering the impact that participation in extracurricular activities can have on academic achievement.

=== Successful educational actions ===
There are experiences analysed by research projects that show how the incorporation of Successful Educational Actions (SEAs) in schools with high absenteeism are contributing to the improvement of academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00406/siinfo.html|title=Increase in school performance(performance rates)[Social Impact].

'''Accra High School''' is a High school located in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]] in West Africa.

==History==
Accra High School was founded by the late Rev. [[James Thomas Roberts]] on 17 August 1923.&lt;ref name="modernghana"/&gt; The school, was located at beach avenue in [[Aayalolo]], a suburb of Accra, Ghana. The school celebrated its first anniversary in August 1924 with a church service at the [[Holy Trinity Cathedral (Accra)|Holy Trinity Cathedral]], Accra and the sermon was delivered by the Anglican Bishop of Accra, the late Dr. [[John Aglionby (bishop)|John Aglionby]]. Thus, there was a tie between the school and the [[Church of England]]. In 1924, the school entered its first candidates for the college of preceptors as well as for the [[Cambridge University]], the royal society of Arts and Pitman`s Shorthand Examinations in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1926, most of the pupils sat and passed the junior Cambridge Examination. In that year, Mr. Frank Roberts, the eldest son of Rev. Roberts, joined the staff after graduating in Bachelor of Arts from the [[United Kingdom]]. He worked hard to enhance the Academic and Disciplinary standard of the school in Accra. In 1927, the late J.O. Ansah Johnson became the first student to pass the [[Cambridge School Certificate Examination]].&lt;ref name="modernghana"&gt;{{cite web|title=Accra High School: 90 Years and still going|url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/498687/1/accra-high-school-90-years-and-still-going.html|publisher=modernghana.com|accessdate=14 February 2014|date=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accra High Secondary School tops tourism quiz|url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/239549/1/accra-high-secondary-school-tops-tourism-quiz.html|publisher=modernghana.com|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ghanaschoolsnet&gt;{{cite web|title=Accra High School|url=http://www.ghanaschoolsnet.com/group/accrahighschool|publisher=ghanaschoolsnet.com|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=omgghana&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Senior High Schools In Accra|url=http://omgghana.com/top-10-senior-high-schools-accra/2/|publisher=omgghana.com|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, members of staff and students performed Shakespeare's ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' with tremendous success and this was followed in 1932 with further excellent performances. Before the founding of Accra High School, the only Secondary Grammar School in Accra, the Accra grammar school, had closed down. However Rev. Roberts had massive support of some men of the highest intellectual and moral calibre. Most of these scholars were Lawyers, Doctors, Civil servants and merchants who had their University education in the United Kingdom. Rev Roberts was ably assisted by Barristers J.A. Glover-Addo, Harry Riberio, E.O. Quist and G. Akilakpa Sawyer, Dr.E.V. Nanka-Bruce and Messrs J.A. Vanderpuye, John Backman, S.O. Akiwumi, A. J. Ocansey, J. P. Garshong and Charles Kojo Bruce. So the school continued to excel and achieve successes in its educational effort. 1952 Accra High School was granted official recognition by the Government and became a Government Public School.

In the year (1952), Rev. Roberts retired at the age of 81. The mantle of headship then fell on Mr. W.S. Conton who ran the school from 1952 to 1956. Mr. Conton was succeeded by Mr. P.O. Sanful, Snr. who ran the school from 1956 to 1966. It was during the headship of Mr. Sanful that Rev. Roberts, the founder and retired Headmaster, died on 5 September 1964, at the age of 94. Accra High school grew from strength to strength and by 1964, the school had expanded from a two-stream to a three-stream school and the enrolment had doubled from 300 to 600 with a teaching staff of 27.
A 9 hectare plot of land had been acquired by Government of Ghana for a new Building at North Ridge near the [[West African Examinations Council]] and the German Embassy in Accra.

By September 1967 the school was relocated when a fifteen-unit classroom block was completed together with a two-storey science block. 1967, Mr. A.N.B Andrews, had then taken over from Mr. Sanful Snr. as headmaster. Mr. Andrews leadership saw further developments in infrastructure such as a ten-unit classroom block, a home science block, a technical block and an administration block, a library and a staff common room, a cafeteria and a students  hostel to house the six form student preparing for their [[A-level]] examinations. All these were in place by the end of the 1976 academic year.

In October 1976, Mr. Andrews left the school on promotion to Ghana Education Service Headquarters as director for schools and colleges. His departure coincided with the grant of sixth form status to the school which he worked hard for. Mr. D.R. Essah who was the assistant headmaster acted for a year during the 1976-77 Academic year before handing over to Mr. P.O. Sanful, Jnr. As the substantive Head in September, 1977. Mr. Sanful ran the school until September, 1986. Mr Sanful did the pioneering work in Sixth Form Education and a Boarding School System at Accra High School. In January, 1987, Mr. E.B. Dogbe became the new Headmaster. He was a person full of discipline and Principles and kept his words. Punctuality was the order of the day. He retired in November 1996 and handed over to Mr. Ben. Nikoi koteye as the substantive Headmaster, in whose term the school celebrated its 75th (Diamond Jubilee) with great pomp and gaiety. A monument was raised by the old students to commemorate the occasion.

Under his headship, the School achieved very remarkable academic results. There was cordiality among the staff and moral was also high among teacher and students. His period saw parents changing their attitude towards the welfare of their children, leading to a vibrant Parent Teacher Association which led subsequent Development in the school. He also saw the landscaping of the compound.

In April 1999 upon the retirement of Mr. Ben Koteye, the mantle fell on Mrs. Sylvia Asempa, the first female to head the school. She continued the good works that her predecessors had set in motion. It was during her time that Accra Ring Road central with support from the Rotary foundation of [[Rotary International]] constructed a multi-purpose playing court on the reclaimed waterlogged triangle of the school. She was also the first bilingual Headteacher of Accra High School. She spoke fluent French hence the further development of the French as a foreign Language in the School.
The P.T.A. Converted the basement of the existing school flat into two, two bedroom unit for staff occupation as well as the establishment of a 150 million computer laboratory for the school. It is worthy of note that some old students also contributed some of the facilities used in the computer lab.
Mrs. Asempa was later transferred to Aburi Girls Secondary School to continue her excellent work.

Under the administration, the bust of the founder was erected on the fore court of the administration block. In March 2002, Accra High School was blessed with yet another dynamic headmaster in the person of Mr. E.A. Kissiedu. Although he has been head for a brief period, he has re-equipped the chemistry and the physics labs, paved the alley in front of the classroom complex, upgraded office equipment sourced new computers for the internet security and constructed of kerbs along the road from the gate to the quadrangle to prevent the perennial erosion. His interest in the promotion of sports has boosted the moral of sports in Boys and Girls in the school. He handed over to Mr. Isaac Ohimeng Gyebi who served from 2006 to 2011. The school is currently headed by Mrs Betty Aduhene-Chinbuah who took over in 2011. Under her leadership, the school is pursuing a redevelopment agenda, with the active support of the alumni (AHISCOSA), to offer the school a facelift and ensure that AHISCO regains its past glory.

Presently, the school runs five programmes, namely: general arts, general science, technical, business,visual art and home economics.The school also houses a science resource centre, French centre bureau de co-ordination nationale des cref and  a completed office complex for the Ghana Education Service Council.
AHISCO, the first secondary school in Accra, is noted for academic excellence, student discipline, sporting talents and excellent marching skills at independence parades.

The program doesn't use prepared lessons, but instead aims to motivate students with enjoyable [[project-based learning]], encouraging them to solve authentic problems which require them to work as a team to arrive at solutions. The program uses [[social media]] such as  [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[Snapchat]], [[Facebook]] and [[YouTube]] to allow students to communicate their ideas, and to display their resulting products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |title=Welcome to Al-Bairaq World |publisher=Qu.edu.qa |date=2014-03-06 |accessdate=2014-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220638/http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |archivedate=2014-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/aboutus.php |title=About us |publisher=Qu.edu.qa |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov.qa/En/Media/News/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=3405 |title=Supreme Education Council - News Details |publisher=Sec.gov.qa |date=2013-12-01 |accessdate=2014-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630045928/http://www.sec.gov.qa/En/Media/News/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=3405 |archivedate=2017-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program tracks==
AL-Bairaq includes four tracks: I am a Researcher, I am Discovering Materials, Science in Sport, and Solving Problems. In each track's semi-final and final events, students compete for several prizes and competitions. The competing candidates are evaluated by a selected panel of judges from different scientific, business, and industrial organizations.

=== I am a Researcher ===
This track is designed to stimulate students' curiosity about science through experimenting with different materials in laboratory setting under professional supervision and guidance. "I am a researcher" offers high school students in Qatar a unique opportunity to get involved in real research conducted at the CAM and other departments in Qatar University, working with the university professors and professional researchers in portions of their current research so that students are able to manage their own hands-on research projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/i_am_researcher.php |title=I am a Researcher |publisher=Qu.edu.qa |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/news/qatar/283245/al-bairaq-holds-workshop-for-high-school-students |title=Al Bairaq holds workshop for high school students |publisher=The Peninsula Qatar |date=2014-05-11 |accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/albiraq_news/alj_honoring_al_biraq_students.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-sharq.com/news/details/213902#.U6gBI_mSxqU |title=الشرق - انطلاق برنامج "أنا باحث" في جامعة قطر |publisher=Al-sharq.com |date=2014-02-24 |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raya.com/news/pages/21406b16-0283-4d73-ad9e-e22cd902d2a0 |title=جريدة الراية - جامعة قطر تكرم الفائزين بالدورة السابعة من "أنا باحث" |publisher=Raya.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students demonstrate their understanding of the scientific concepts as well as their ideas and thoughts via [[PowerPoint]] and other presentation tools. They present in a public forum and their learning and work are evaluated by a jury from business and industrial organizations. In addition to research activities, and as complement to them, “I am a Researcher” track include many science and art competitions where participants in their groups will be candidates for winning one of our multiple and various prizes. Winners will be selected, based on pre-defined criteria, by a panel of experts formed from sponsor companies and from business and industrial organizations in Qatar. 


=== I am Discovering Materials ===
This track aims to introduce the students to variety of topics in [[materials science]]. These modules are all built around a common structure, where four or more related activities introduce an important topic in contemporary materials science.  Through these activities, students learn about the topic by investigating key features of the materials that are the focus of the module. Then students use what they have learned from the activities to participate in a design project. This project aims to inspire students to design, test, and build their own product that uses the materials which are the focus of the module.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/i_am_discovering_materials.php |title=I am discovering Materials |publisher=Qu.edu.qa |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/albiraq_news/alj_qatari_program_for_young_researchers.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
One example of students' projects is the conversion of [[carbon dioxide]] into [[methanol]].

Students are encouraged to discover the interconnections between the STEM fields and society, and make a direct connection between what they are learning in class and their everyday lives.

=== Science in Sport ===
"Science in Sport" is involved in all areas of sport from timing, distance measurement, materials [[technology]], and performance monitoring. The inspiration of science is found in every aspect of sport materials, and the technology is frequently working on better production for sports materials. Bringing the interest of the students in sports through technical aspects of science themes, may include design, materials, mechanics, dynamics, math, and engineering, to create sports materials using different simple materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/science_in_sport_media.php |title=Science in Sport Media |publisher=Qu.edu.qa |date= |accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/documents/Alarab.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solving Problems ===
Through this track, students learn how to solve a problem through a simulation of a problem. They have the freedom to solve it under the supervision of the AL-Bairaq team.

== Results ==
The effects of AL-Bairaq on the secondary school students are supported by the results of a research carried out in Qatar, which concluded that the advanced learning environment resulted in the improvement of the students’ ability to acquire and retain new knowledge. Furthermore, the advanced learning environment had a direct positive impact on students’ attitude towards research, and students gained positive attitudes towards work as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://ejes.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1-2-23.pdf Al-Ghanim, K.A; Al-Maadeed, M.A and Al-Thani, N.J (Sept. 2014) : Impact of Innovative Learning Environment Based on Research Activities on Secondary School Students' Attitude Towards Research and Their Self-Efficacy, EJES, 1(3), 39-57&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''almanac''' (also spelled ''almanack'' and ''almanach'') is an [[annual publication]] listing a set of events forthcoming in the next year.

It includes information like [[weather forecasting|weather forecasts]], farmers' [[planting]] dates, [[tide table]]s, and other [[table (information)|tabular]] [[data]] often arranged according to the [[calendar]]. [[celestial event|Celestial]] figures and various statistics are found in almanacs, such as the [[sunrise|rising]] and [[sunset|setting]] times of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], dates of [[eclipse]]s, hours of high and low [[tide]]s, and [[religious festival]]s.

A calendar, which is a system for time keeping, in written form is usually produced as a most simple almanac: it includes additional information about the day of the week on which a particular day falls, major holidays, the phases of the moon, earthquake hazard levels etc. The set of events noted in an almanac are selected in view of a more or less specific group of readers e.g. farmers, sailors, astronomers or others.

== Etymology ==

The etymology of the word is unclear. It is suggested{{by whom|date=June 2018}} the word ''almanac'' derives from a Greek word meaning ''calendar''.  However, that word appears only once in antiquity, by Eusebius who quotes Porphyry as to the Coptic Egyptian use of astrological charts (''almenichiaká''). The earliest almanacs were calendars that included agricultural, astronomical, or meteorological data. But it is highly unlikely [[Roger Bacon]] received the word from this etymology: "Notwithstanding the suggestive sound and use of this word (of which however the real form is very uncertain), the difficulties of connecting it historically either with the [[Spanish Arabic]] manākh, or with [[Medieval Latin]] almanach without Arabic intermediation, seem insurmountable."&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest documented use of the word in any language is in Latin in 1267 by [[Roger Bacon]], where it meant a set of tables detailing movements of heavenly bodies including the moon.

One etymology report says "The ultimate source of the word is obscure. Its first syllable, al-, and its general relevance to medieval science and technology, strongly suggest an Arabic origin, but no convincing candidate has been found".&lt;ref&gt;"Word Origins" by John Ayto (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Another report similarly says of ''almanac'': "First seen in Roger Bacon. Apparently from Spanish Arabic, ''al-manakh'', but this is not an Arabic word....The word remains a puzzle."&lt;ref&gt;Quote from [https://archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00weekuoft/ ''An Etymological Dictionary of Modern English'', by Ernest Weekley (1921)]. Similarly, [https://archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00skeauoft ''An Etymological Dictionary'' by Walter W. Skeat (1888)] concludes that the construction of an Arabic source for almanac "is not satisfactory".&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New English Dictionary on Historical Principles|Oxford English Dictionary]]'' similarly says "the word has no etymon in Arabic" but indirect circumstantial evidence "points to a Spanish Arabic ''al-manākh''".&lt;ref&gt;"Almanac" in [https://archive.org/stream/oed01arch#page/244/mode/1up ''New English Dictionary on Historical Principles''] (which has an extra "note as to the origin and history of the word ''almanac''").&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason why the proposed Arabic word is speculatively spelled ''al-manākh'' is that the spelling occurred as "almanach", as well as almanac (and Roger Bacon used both spellings). The earliest use of the word was in the context of astronomy calendars.

The prestige of the [[Tables of Toledo]] and other [[astronomy in medieval Islam|medieval Arabic astronomy works]] at the time of the word's emergence in the West, together with the absence of the word in Arabic, suggest it may have been invented in the West and is pseudo-Arabic. At that time in the West, it would have been prestigious to attach an Arabic appellation to a set of astronomical tables. Also around that time, prompted by that motive, the Latin writer [[Pseudo-Geber]] wrote under an Arabic pseudonym. (The later alchemical word ''[[alkahest]]'' is known to be pseudo-Arabic.)

== History ==

=== Hemerologies and parapegmata ===

The earlier texts considered to be almanacs have been found in the [[Near East]], dating back to the middle of the second millennium BC. They have been called generally hemerologies, from the Greek ''hēmerā'', meaning "day". Among them is the so-called [[Babylonian Almanac]], which lists favorable and unfavorable days with advice on what to do on each of them. Successive variants and versions aimed at different readership have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, A. (1998) "The use of magic in the Assyrian and Babylonian hemerologies and menolgies." Studi epigrafici e linguistici sul Vicino Oriente antico 15 (1998) 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian lists of good and bad moments, three times each day, have also been found. Many of these prognostics were connected with celestial events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Porceddu, S., Jetsu, L., Lyytinen, J., Kajatkari, P., Lehtinen, J., Markkanen, T, Toivari-Viitala, J.|title=Evidence of Periodicity in Ancient Egyptian Calendars of Lucky and Unlucky Days|journal = Cambridge Archaeological Journal|volume =18|issue=3|year = 2008|pages = 327–339|doi=10.1017/S0959774308000395|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2374180|bibcode=2008CArcJ..18..327P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Jetsu, L., Porceddu, S., Lyytinen, J., Kajatkari, P., Lehtinen, J., Markkanen, T, Toivari-Viitala, J.|title=Did the Ancient Egyptians Record the Period of the Eclipsing Binary Algol&amp;nbsp;— The Raging One? |journal = The Astrophysical Journal|volume =773|issue=1|year = 2013|pages = A1 (14pp)|doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/773/1/1|bibcode=2013ApJ...773....1J|arxiv = 1204.6206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author=Jetsu, L. | author2=Porceddu, S. | title=Shifting Milestones of Natural Sciences: The Ancient Egyptian Discovery of Algol's Period Confirmed | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 10 |issue = 12 | date = 2015 | pages = e.0144140 (23pp) | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0144140 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The flooding of the Nile valley, a most important event in ancient Egypt, was expected to occur at the summer solstice but as the civil calendar had exactly 365 days, over the centuries  the date was drifting in the calendar.&lt;ref&gt;The new year coincides with the summer solstice once in 1441 years, which is known as the [[sothic period]].&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[heliacal rising]] of Sirius was used for its prediction and this practice, the observation of some star and its connecting to some event apparently spread.

The Greek almanac, known as parapegma, has existed in the form an inscribed stone on which the days of the month were indicated by movable pegs inserted into bored holes, hence the name. There were also written texts and according to [[Diogenes Laërtius]], ''Parapegma'' was the title of a book by [[Democritus]].&lt;ref&gt;Lehoux D., ''Parapegmata, Astrology, Weather, and Calendars in the Ancient World'', (thesis), National Library of Canada, 2000; includes a list of surviving parapegmata (plural of 'parapegma') and bibliography&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy]], the [[Alexandria]]n astronomer (2nd century) wrote a treatise, ''Phaseis''—"phases of fixed stars and collection of weather-changes" is the translation of its full title—the core of which is a ''parapegma'', a list of dates of seasonally regular weather changes, first appearances and last appearances of [[star]]s or [[constellation]]s at sunrise or sunset, and solar events such as [[solstice]]s, all organized according to the solar year. With the astronomical computations were expected weather phenomena, composed as a digest of observations made by various authorities of the past. ''Parapegmata'' had been composed for centuries.

Ptolemy believed that astronomical phenomena caused the changes in seasonal weather; his explanation of why there was not an exact correlation of these events was that the physical influences of other heavenly bodies also came into play. Hence for him, weather prediction was a special division of [[astrology]].&lt;ref name="ptolemy"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ajones/ptolgeog/astroworks.html |title=Ptolemy's Astronomical Works (other than the Almagest) |accessdate=2007-04-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208073111/http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ajones/ptolgeog/astroworks.html |archivedate=2007-02-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ephemerides, zijs and tables ===

The origins of the almanac can be connected to ancient [[Babylonian astronomy]], when tables of planetary periods were produced in order to predict lunar and planetary phenomena.&lt;ref name=Glick&gt;{{Harvnb|Glick|Livesey|Wallis|2005|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar treatises called [[Zij]] were later composed in medieval [[Islamic astronomy]].

The modern almanac differs from Babylonian, Ptolemaic and Zij tables in the sense that "the entries found in the almanacs give directly the positions of the celestial bodies and need no further computation", in contrast to the more common "auxiliary astronomical tables" based on Ptolemy's ''Almagest''. The earliest known almanac in this modern sense is the ''Almanac of Azarqueil'' written in 1088 by [[Abū Ishāq Ibrāhīm al-Zarqālī]] (Latinized as Arzachel) in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[al-Andalus]]. The work provided the true daily positions of the sun, moon and planets for four years from 1088 to 1092, as well as many other related tables. A [[Latin]] translation and adaptation of the work appeared as the ''[[Tables of Toledo]]'' in the 12th century and the ''[[Alfonsine tables]]'' in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glick|Livesey|Wallis|2005|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=January 2012}}

After almanacs were devised, people still saw little difference between predicting the movements of the stars and tides, and predicting the future in the [[divination]] sense. Early almanacs therefore contained general [[horoscope]]s, as well as the more concrete information. In 1150 [[Solomon Jarchus]] created such an almanac considered to be among the first modern almanacs. Copies of 12th century almanacs are found in the British Museum, and in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. In 1300, [[Petrus de Dacia (mathematician)|Petrus de Dacia]] created an almanac (Savilian Library, Oxford). This was the same year Roger Bacon, OFM, produced his as well. In 1327 [[Walter de Elvendene]] created an almanac and later on [[John Somers, 1st Baron Somers|John Somers]] of Oxford, in 1380. In 1386 Nicholas de Lynne, Oxford produced an almanac. In 1457 the first printed almanac was published at Mainz, by Gutenberg (eight years before the famous Bible). Regio-Montanus produced an almanac in 1472 (Nuremberg, 1472), which was continued in print for several centuries in many editions. In 1497 the ''[[Sheapheard’s Kalendar]]'', translated from French ([[Richard Pynson]]) became the first English printed almanac.

=== Early modern era ===
[[File:Book of incantations f. 25r - Prophetic Almanack.png|thumb|left|An English Prophetic Almanack, 1825]]

By the second half of the 16th century, yearly almanacs were being produced in England by men such as Anthony Askham, Thomas Buckminster, John Dade and Gabriel Frende. In the 17th century, English almanacs were bestsellers, second only to the Bible; by the middle of the century, 400,000 almanacs were being produced annually (a complete listing can be found in the [http://estc.bl.uk/F/?func=file&amp;file_name=login-bl-estc English Short Title Catalogue]). Until its deregulation in 1775, the Stationers' Company maintained a lucrative monopoly over almanac publication in England.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. (2011). Books: A living history. Los Angeles, CA: Getty Publications. pp. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Allestree (who is not the same as this [[Richard Allestree]]) wrote one of the more popular English almanacs, producing yearly volumes from 1617 to 1643, but his is by no means the earliest or the longest-running almanac.

In British America, William Pierce of Harvard College published the first [[American almanac]] entitled, ''An Almanac for New England for the year 1639'' Cambridge, Massachusetts. Harvard became the first center for the annual publication of almanacs with various editors including [[Samuel Danforth]], Oakes, Cheever, Chauncey, Dudley, Foster, et alia. An almanac maker going under the pseudonym of Poor Richard, Knight of the Burnt Island began to publish ''[[Poor Robin's Almanack]]'' one of the first comic almanacs that parodied these horoscopes in its 1664 issue, saying "This month we may expect to hear of the Death of some Man, Woman, or Child, either in Kent or Christendom." Other noteworthy comic almanacs include those published from 1687-1702 by John Tully of Saybrook, Connecticut.

The most important early American almanacs were made from 1726-1775 by [[Nathaniel Ames]] of Dedham, Massachusetts. A few years later [[James Franklin (printer)|James Franklin]] began publishing the [[Rhode-Island Almanack]] beginning in 1728. Five years later his brother [[Benjamin Franklin]] began publishing ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'' from 1733-1758. [[Benjamin Banneker]], a free African American, composed a series of almanacs from 1792-1797.

=== Contemporary use ===

Currently published almanacs such as ''[[Whitaker's Almanack]]'' have expanded their scope and contents beyond that of their historical counterparts. Modern almanacs include a comprehensive presentation of statistical and descriptive data covering the entire world. Contents also include discussions of topical developments and a summary of recent historical events. Other currently published almanacs (ca. 2006) include ''[[TIME Almanac with Information Please]]'', ''[[World Almanac|World Almanac and Book of Facts]]'', ''[[Farmers' Almanac|The Farmer's Almanac]]'' and ''[[Old Farmer's Almanac|The Old Farmer's Almanac]]'' and The Almanac for Farmers &amp; City Folk. The ''Inverness Almanac'' [http://www.invernessalmanac.com]," an almanac/literary journal, was published in West Marin, California, from 2015 to 2016. In 2007, Harrowsmith Country Life Magazine launched a Canadian Almanac, written in Canada, with all-Canadian content. The nonprofit agrarian organization the Greenhorns [http://www.thegreenhorns.net/] currently publishes ''The New Farmer's Almanac'' as a resource for young farmers.

Major topics covered by almanacs (reflected by their tables of contents) include: [[geography]], [[government]], [[demographics]], [[agriculture]], [[economics]] and [[business]], [[health]] and [[medicine]], [[religion]], [[mass media]], [[transportation]], [[science]] and [[technology]], [[sport]], and [[award]]s/[[prize]]s.

Other examples include ''[[The Almanac of American Politics]]'' published by [[Columbia Books &amp; Information Services]], ''The Almanac of American Literature'', and ''The [[Almanac of British Politics]]''.

From 1985 to 1990, approximately 53 per cent of all almanac sales sold in the United States were sold through the "Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1985)" computer game pack that included a complimentary ''[[World Almanac|World Almanac and Book of Facts]].''

The [[GPS almanac]], as part of the data transmitted by each GPS satellite, contains coarse orbit and status information for all satellites in the constellation, an ionospheric model, and information to relate GPS derived time to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Hence the GPS almanac provide a similar goal as the ancient Babylonian almanac, to find celestial bodies.

'''Azerbaijan University of Languages''' ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Dillər Universiteti}}) is a [[public university]] in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]. The student body consists of approximately 4000 undergraduates and 900 graduate ([[master's degree]]) students. The university has a combined faculty of more than 700 teachers.

==History==
The beginnings of the university can be traced to 1937, with Azerbaijan Pedagogical Institute's opening of the School of Foreign Languages. In 1940, the Azerbaijan Communist Party decreed that a separate Institute of Foreign Languages be formed, but the outbreak of [[World War II]] caused the new Institute to quickly fold back into Azerbaijan Pedagogical Institute.  After the war, the government of [[Azerbaijan SSR]] created the Azerbaijan Institute of Foreign Languages in 1948, but it was folded into the Azerbaijan Institute of Russian Language and Literature in 1959. Finally, in 1973, the Azerbaijan Pedagogical Institute of Foreign Languages was established as an independent institution. In 1996 the school was renamed the Azerbaijan State Institute of Languages. In 2000 the institute was given university status and renamed as the Azerbaijan University of Languages.

The University maintains close relations with [[UNESCO]], operating a UNESCO Translation Department as well as hosting a UNESCO-sponsored faculty chair.
There are 7 schools, 25 departments at the university, a lot of scientific centers, laboratories activate at present.

As a result of the educational reforms, Azerbaijan University of Languages has been the first university which transmitted the whole system to credit system. The university has cooperation with higher educational institutions of Turkey, the U.S, the United Kingdom, France and other European institutions. Student exchanges have been intensive thanks to those cooperation.

Afgan Ali Abdullayev is current acting rector of the university. He was born in Yevlakh region, where he graduated from high school. Upon receipt of the Azerbaijan Pedagogical University of Foreign Languages, students majoring in English and Azerbaijan Languages of Azerbaijan University of Languages (AUL), where he subsequently worked as a dean, and now – a vice-rector. After graduation, he continued his education in graduate of the Azerbaijan State University of Foreign Languages with a degree in Germanic languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adu.edu.az/en/2016/11/vice-rector-for-academic-affairs/|title=AUL|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brian Leiter''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|aɪ|t|ər}}; born 1963) is an American philosopher and legal scholar who is [[Karl N. Llewellyn]] Professor of Jurisprudence at the [[University of Chicago Law School]] and founder and Director of Chicago's Center for Law, Philosophy &amp; Human Values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.uchicago.edu/centers/lawphilosophyandhumanvalues|title=Center for Law, Philosophy, and Human Values - University of Chicago Law School|work=uchicago.edu|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A review in ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'' described Leiter as "one of the most influential legal philosophers of our time",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24103-naturalizing-jurisprudence-essays-on-american-legal-realism-and-naturalism-in-legal-philosophy/|title=Review of Naturalizing Jurisprudence: Essays on American Legal Realism and Naturalism in Legal Philosophy|first=Robin Bradley|last=Kar|date=31 July 2009|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2016|via=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a review in ''[[The Journal of Nietzsche Studies]]'' described Leiter's book ''Nietzsche on Morality'' (2002) as "arguably the most important book on Nietzsche's philosophy in the past twenty years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/jns/reviews/ken-gemes-and-simon-may-eds.-nietzsche-on-freedom-and-autonomy|title=Ken Gemes and Simon May, eds., Nietzsche on Freedom and Autonomy — Hunter College|work=cuny.edu|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leiter taught from 1995 to 2008 at the [[University of Texas School of Law]], where he was founder and Director of the Law and Philosophy Program.  He joined the University of Chicago faculty in 2008. His scholarly writings have been primarily in legal philosophy and Continental philosophy, especially [[Nietzsche]] and [[Marx]]. He has also been a visiting professor at universities in the United States and Europe, including [[Yale University]] and [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/leiter/|title=Brian Leiter - University of Chicago Law School|work=uchicago.edu|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He is founding editor of a book series entitled ''Routledge Philosophers'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/series/SE0831/|title=Book Series - Routledge|work=routledge.com|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (with [[Leslie Green (philosopher)|Leslie Green]]) of ''Oxford Studies in Philosophy of Law.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199606443.001.0001/acprof-9780199606443|title=Oxford Studies in Philosophy of LawVolume 1 - Oxford Scholarship|work=oxfordscholarship.com|accessdate=1 November 2016|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199606443.001.0001/acprof-9780199606443}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a prolific blogger.  Leiter was also the founder and for 25 years the editor of the [[Philosophical Gourmet Report]] ("PGR"), an influential but also controversial ranking of philosophy PhD programs in the English-speaking world.  After repeated protests, one in 2002 and one in 2014, Leiter retired and turned over editorship of the PGR to [[Berit Brogaard]], a philosopher at the [[University of Miami]], and Christopher Pynes, a philosopher at [[Western Illinois University]].

==Education and career==
Born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/04/mondoweiss-is-a-hate-site/ Washington Post: ""Mondoweiss" is a hate site (Update)" by  David Bernstein] May 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Leiter earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in philosophy from [[Princeton University]] (1984), and his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] (1987) and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] (in philosophy; 1995) from the [[University of Michigan]], where his dissertation was supervised by [[Peter Railton]].&lt;ref name="UChicago"/&gt;

Leiter taught for two years at the [[University of San Diego School of Law]], and was a visiting assistant professor of philosophy at the [[University of California, San Diego]].,&lt;ref name="UChicago"/&gt; before joining the faculty at the [[University of Texas School of Law]] in 1995, where he taught until 2008.&lt;ref name="UChicago"/&gt;  At Texas, Leiter was founder and Director of the Law and Philosophy Program.  In 2008, Leiter moved to the [[University of Chicago]], where he is now Karl N. Llewellyn Professor of Jurisprudence at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], and founder of Chicago's Center for Law, Philosophy &amp; Human Values.&lt;ref name="UChicago"/&gt;

Leiter has been a visiting professor of law or philosophy at [[Yale Law School]], [[University College London]], University of Chicago Law School, [[University of Paris X-Nanterre]], University of California, San Diego, and [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name="UChicago"&gt;{{cite web|title=Brian Leiter|url=http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/leiter/|publisher=The University of Chicago Law School|accessdate=December 14, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016044935/http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/leiter/|archivedate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He edited the journal ''[[Legal Theory (journal)|Legal Theory]]'' from 2000 to 2008, and is editor of the ''Routledge Philosophers'', a series of introductions to major philosophers, and (with [[Leslie Green (philosopher)|Leslie Green]]) of ''Oxford Studies in the Philosophy of Law''.&lt;ref name="UChicago"/&gt;

Author [[Walter K. Olson]] described Leiter as "[[left-leaning]]" in his book ''Schools for Misrule: Legal Academia and an Overlawyered America'' (Encounter Books, 2011).&lt;ref name=misrule&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhS_Cesn1-wC&amp;dq=%22brian+leiter%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title= Schools for Misrule: Legal Academia and an Overlawyered America|author=Walter K. Olson|publisher=Encounter Books|year= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Leiter himself has professed sympathy for Marx, stating in an interview that, "On two central issues, Marx was far more right than any of his critics: first, that the long-term tendency of capitalist societies is towards immiseration of the majority (the post-WWII illusion of upward mobility for the "middle classes" will soon be revealed for the anomaly it was); and second, that capitalist societies produce moral and political ideologies that serve to justify the dominance of the capitalist class."&lt;ref name="3ammagazine.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/leiter-reports/|title=Leiter Reports -|date=19 December 2011|work=3ammagazine.com|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical work ==

Leiter's scholarly writings have been in two main areas--legal philosophy and Continental philosophy--although he has also written about metaethics, religious liberty, and other topics. [[Philosophical naturalism]] has been a major theme in both contexts.&lt;ref name="3ammagazine.com"/&gt;

===Legal philosophy===

In legal philosophy, Leiter has offered a reinterpretation of American [[Legal Realism]] as embodying a prescient philosophical naturalism and a defense of what he called "naturalized jurisprudence" in his book ''Naturalizing Jurisprudence: Essays on American Legal Realism and Naturalism in Legal Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 2007).  Upon publication, [[Jeremy Horder]] wrote that the "book will confirm Brian Leiter 's place in the front rank of legal theorists in the world today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/naturalizing-jurisprudence-9780199206490?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;#|title=Naturalizing Jurisprudence|work=oup.com|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leiter also wrote the entry on "Naturalism in Legal Philosophy" for the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/lawphil-naturalism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Brian|last=Leiter|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2014|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2016|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On his view, "philosophers generally should aim to unpack the 'concepts that have been vindicated by their role in successful explanation and prediction of empirical phenomena'" and thus should "'take seriously the…social scientific literature on law…to see what concept of law figures in the most powerful explanatory and predictive models of legal phenomena such as judicial behavior.' This methodological view, however, raises questions about why the legal philosopher should study only judicial behavior and not something else. More generally, the naturalist owes an account of what features of law are most in need of explication and why."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/lawphil-nature/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Andrei|last1=Marmor|first2=Alexander|last2=Sarch|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2016|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continental philosophy===

Leiter is also a scholar of [[Continental philosophy]], and is co-editor with [[Michael E. Rosen]] of ''The Oxford Handbook of Continental Philosophy''. He has written a considerable amount on the philosophical work of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], including an article for the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Brian|last=Leiter|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2016|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Leiter defended a reading of Nietzsche as a philosophical naturalist in his ''Nietzsche on Morality'' (London: Routledge, 2002) and in later papers, including one with [[Joshua Knobe]] on "The Case for Nietzschean Moral Psychology" in ''Nietzsche and Morality'' (Oxford University Press, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23289-nietzsche-and-morality/|title=Review of Nietzsche and Morality|first=Scott|last=Jenkins|date=3 January 2008|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2016|via=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, when student members of the [[University College London]] Union Council informed the "Nietzsche Club" that it could no longer declare an affiliation with the school, because the club was promoting "far-right" and "fascist" ideologies, Leiter first defended the club, saying Nietzsche was not a fascist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-leiter/nietzsche-and-fascism_b_5458843.html | work=Huffington Post | title=The Recurring Myth About Nietzsche and Fascism | date=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later noted that if the club is a front for a fascist group, then it's a shame that Nietzsche was smeared as a fascist in the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2014/06/bigmouth-law-professor-flubs-research-defends-racists/|title=Bigmouth Law Professor Flubs Research, Defends Racists|work=Above the Law|author=Joe Patrice|date=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===

Leiter's most recent book, ''Why Tolerate Religion?'', published by [[Princeton University Press]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9839.html|title=Leiter, B.: Why Tolerate Religion?|author=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; has proved controversial.  The political philosopher [[John Gray (philosopher)|John Gray]] wrote, "A model of clarity and rigour and at points strikingly original, this is a book that anyone who thinks seriously about religion, ethics and politics will benefit from reading."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/culture/2012/11/giant-leaps-mankind|title=Giant leaps for mankind|work=newstatesman.com|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Christopher L. Eisgruber]], the President of [[Princeton University]], said. "Every reader will learn something from this remarkable book, and, beginning now, every serious scholar of religious toleration will have to contend with Leiter's bold claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/quotes/q9839.html|title=Additional Reviews and/or Endorsements for Leiter, B.: Why Tolerate Religion?|work=princeton.edu|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, the website of the conservative [[Family Research Council]] said the book was "one of the most troubling and intellectually discreditable books by a serious American scholar in some time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frcblog.com/2013/05/response-why-tolerate-religion/|title=A Response to "Why Tolerate Religion?"|first=Rob|last=Schwarzwalder|work=frcblog.com|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was named an "Outstanding Academic Title" by ''Choice'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cro3.org/content/51/05/759.extract&lt;/ref&gt;

Leiter has also published work on [[meta-ethics]], [[social epistemology]], the law of evidence, and on philosophers [[Karl Marx]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Ronald Dworkin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.uchicago.edu/node/572/publications|title=Brian Leiter : Publications - University of Chicago Law School|work=uchicago.edu|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical Gourmet Report and other academic rankings ==

In 1989, while he was a graduate student Leiter made a list of what he believed to be the top 25 graduate philosophy programs in the United States.&lt;ref name=chron1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=Peter|title=The Man Who Ranks Philosophy Departments Now Rankles Them, Too|url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Man-Who-Ranks-Philosophy/149007/|website=Chronicle.com|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=September 30, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926193400/http://chronicle.com/article/The-Man-Who-Ranks-Philosophy/149007/|archivedate=September 26, 2014|deadurl=no|date=September 26, 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Called the [[Philosophical Gourmet Report]], this list came to be known as "the Leiter Report" and has been internationally recognized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mlAAkak_vYwC&amp;q=%22brian+leiter%22&amp;dq=%22brian+leiter%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bSRpVfP0EMvFsAXKjYOQBA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBzjIAQ|title=The Real Guide to Grad School: The humanities|author=Edward Batchelder, John Palattella|publisher=

The PGR was described by [[David L. Kirp]] in a 2003 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' op-ed as "the bible for prospective [philosophy] graduate students."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirp|first1=David|title=How Much for That Professor?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/27/opinion/27KIRP.html|accessdate=May 28, 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 27, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  George Yancy, in ''Reframing the Practice of Philosophy: Bodies of Color, Bodies of Knowledge'' ([[SUNY Press]], 2012), opined that Philosophical Gourmet Report ranking: "is, of course, very controversial. However, as is often pointed out, there is no real alternative."&lt;ref name=reframe/&gt; [[Carlin Romano]], in ''America the Philosophical'' ([[Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group]], 2013), referred to the PGR rankings as "often-criticized" and "biased towards mainstream analytic departments" although it covers [[Continental philosophy]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uUAc6z2uSnAC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Philosophy+gourmet+report+controversy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B3ZmVYrTIYursAX7pIDIDg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Philosophy%20gourmet%20report%20controversy&amp;f=false|title=America the Philosophical|author=[[Carlin Romano]]|publisher=
Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year= 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, 175 philosophers signed an open letter calling on Leiter to stop producing the PGR.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/175-Philosophy-Professors/34484/|title=175 Philosophy Professors Blast Ranking of Graduate Programs|first=Katherine S.|last=Mangan|date=18 January 2002|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2016|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 2014, over 600 philosophers signed a petition to boycott the PGR organized by some philosophers at [[University of British Columbia]] to protest what they called a "derogatory and intimidating" e-mail sent by Leiter to one of their colleagues, who Leiter claimed had threatened him.&lt;ref name="chronicle.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Man-Who-Ranks-Philosophy/149007/|title=The Man Who Ranks Philosophy Departments Now Rankles Them, Too|first=Peter|last=Schmidt|date=26 September 2014|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2016|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; 24 of the 56 members of the Advisory Board of the PGR thought it best that he relinquish control over the Report's management.&lt;ref name="chronicle.com"/&gt;

In response, Leiter appointed a co-editor for the 2014 report [[Berit Brogaard]], a philosophy professor at the [[University of Miami]] and agreed to step down as editor after its publication.&lt;ref name="chronicle.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/controversial-philosopher-will-step-down-as-editor-of-influential-rankings/87797|title=Controversial Philosopher Will Step Down as Editor of Influential Rankings|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=October 10, 2014|author=Andy Thomason}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leiter dismissed the criticisms as coming from people whose organizations had received a poor ranking, or from feminists upset with his stance in favor of due process for men accused of sexual harassment.&lt;ref name="chronicle.com"/&gt;  He subsequently retained a lawyer to sue the organizers of the 2014 protest for defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2014/12/carrie-jenkins-boycott-statement-september-falsehoods.html|title=The boycott statement from September contained falsehoods (plus the actual lawyer letter to Jenkins and Ichikawa)|work=typepad.com|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Australian]]'' reported that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Professor Leiter ... said there had never been any impropriety in his administration of the report but "if someone feels editing the PGR means forfeiting certain expressive rights, then I accept that they have a reason not to participate while I remain as one of the editors. And since I value my expressive rights (including my right to express myself in ways some others may find offensive), that gives me an additional reason to dissociate from the PGR so that those philosophers will, I hope, participate in the future." At least, unlike Socrates, Professor Leiter isn't being forced to drink hemlock for saying it as he sees it.&lt;ref name="theaustralian.com.au"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/high-wired/high-wired-update-hear-no-evil/story-fnizwcu6-1227088447477 | work=The Australian | title=Hear no evil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leiter has also edited a ranking of U.S. [[Law school in the United States|law schools]], which ''The Washington Post'' describes as "well-known,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/09/26/the-professor-who-ranks-and-rankles/|title=The professor who ranks and rankles|work=The Washington Post |author=Jonathan H. Adler |date=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was hired by ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine in Canada to produce a ranking of [[List of law schools in Canada|Canadian law schools]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macleans.ca/education/universities/article.jsp?content=20070912_144046_5680 Law Schools Ranked] ''Maclean's'', September 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blogging and other public activities==

Leiter is a prolific blogger, running three blogs, one on philosophy (and political commentary), one on law, and one on Nietzsche.  Leiter's philosophy blog includes both professional news and polemics, for example, critiques of proponents of [[intelligent design]],&lt;ref name="drum_wm"&gt;[http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_03/003541.php Political Animal, Intelligent Design] [[Kevin Drum]].

'''Cleveland Scholarship Programs'''(now '''College Now Greater Cleveland''') was established in 1966 by Robert Coplan, one of the founders of the Benesch, Friedlander, Coplan, and Aronoff law firm. Since then, it has grown into one of the nation’s leading college access program. They have received national recognition and are recognized as being one of the first organizations of its type, and a precursor to other similar organizations located in [[Baltimore]], [[Boston]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Miami]], [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Washington, D.C.]] and numerous other cities.

College Now helps families and children by providing access to postsecondary education. Since they began 43 years ago, College Now(then CSP) has helped more than 200,000 students go through the college and financial aid application process and has awarded more than $42 million in scholarships. College Now provides college access services to Cuyahoga County residents interested in enrolling in four-year universities, community colleges and vocational and technical programs.  College Now offers:

* Academic planning for higher education
* Financial aid advising and resources
* Scholarships
* College advising and resources
* Career advising and opportunities
* Encouragement

College Now serves students from kindergarten through high school in [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga]] and [[Lorain County, Ohio|Lorain]] counties, and adult learners who want to return to college in 11 Northeast Ohio Counties: Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Mahoning, Medina, Portage, Stark, Summit, and Trumbull.

College Now's college advisors are present at many North-East Ohio public high schools to assist students through one-on-one advising and group sessions. Many advisors are present throughout the majority of the academic year and may be in each school one or more days per week.

College Now's programs help thousands of students in North East Ohio. These programs include, but are not limited to, the Early Awareness, Educational Talent Search, GEAR UP and Learn-to-Work programs.

Many scholarships average $1,300 per student and are renewable for four years, if the students continue to meet specified requirements. During fiscal year 2007-2008, College Now paid a total $2,865,715 in scholarships to more than 2,000 individuals. This represents a 6 percent increase in the number of students awarded scholarships from the previous academic year.

College Now also administers scholarships for companies and organizations for a fee. For fiscal year 2007-2008, College Now administered $584,833 for over twenty scholarship programs.

== CMSD Top 50 Program ==

One of College Now's newest programs is the Top 50 Program throughout the [[Cleveland Metropolitan School District]](CMSD). in the Top 50 program, 50 students(or more, depending on circumstances) in the CMSD are chosen for extra one-on-one advising with a selected College Now advisor. Some of the benefits of participating in the CMSD Top 50 Program are:

* Specialized attention with one-on-one advising.
* Free college visits and overnight trips.
* FAFSA and college application assistance.
* College application assistance.
* Additional scholarship opportunities.
* Networking with like-minded individuals.

The criteria (as of the 2011-2012 academic year) for being chosen and/or accepted into the program depends mainly on a student's standardized test scores and grade point average, but can also depend on other additional factors as well.

Students in the Top 50 program are encouraged to apply to prestigious and ivy league schools/universities that otherwise may be thought of as out of reach for Cleveland high school seniors. A few individuals in the Top 50 Program (as of the 2011-2012 school year) have been accepted to such universities as [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Stanford University|Stanford]], showing the success of the program.

EQUIS' directors as of 2018 are Ulrich Hommel and David Asch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS)|url=http://www.efmd.org/what-is-efmd/whos-who|journal=http://www.efmd.org/what-is-efmd/whos-who}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past 20 years of existence{{When|date=February 2018}} the organization has accredited 172 institutions in 41 countries.&lt;ref name=members/&gt;

== Object of the accreditation ==
The accreditation is awarded to business schools based on general quality. The process also takes into account the business school's level of internationalization, which is not a strict requirement for accreditation by the other two major international accreditation bodies: [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business|AACSB]] and [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools | doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 | volume=32 | journal=European Management Journal | pages=529–534}}&lt;/ref&gt; So far,{{When|date=February 2018}} all fully accredited EQUIS business schools applying for AACSB accreditation have succeeded, which has not been the case the other way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=???|url=http://mba-news.net/2014/02/05/mba-accreditation/|journal=http://mba-news.net|date=5 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140711064708/http://mba-news.net/2014/02/05/mba-accreditation/|archivedate=11 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EQUIS accreditation can be granted for three years (with annual progress reports on the areas of improvement required) or for five years (with a mid-term progress report on development objectives required).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS)|url=https://www.efmd.org/images/stories/efmd/EQUIS/2014/EQUIS_Process_Manual.pdf|date = 18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Early College High School Initiative''' in the United States allows students to receive a [[high school diploma]] and an [[associate degree]], or up to two years of [[college credit]], by taking a mixture of [[high school]] and [[college]] classes. This differs from [[dual enrollment]], where students are enrolled in a traditional high school and take college classes, whereas early college students take high school classes in preparation for full college workloads. At early colleges, students also have fewer high school classes because some of their college classes replace their high school classes. Early colleges differ from closely related middle colleges. ECHS students spend their school day at college, and go to their home school occasionally for events such as football games, homecoming, and prom. 

The ECHS Initiative began in 2002 with funding from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], among others. The first early college in the United States, Bard College at Simon's Rock, was founded in 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.k12academics.com/national-directories/gifted-school/bard-college-simons-rock|title=Bard College at Simon's Rock {{!}} K12 Academics|date=2018-02-24|website=www.k12academics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Today, more than 230 early colleges across 28 states serve 50,000+ students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview &amp; FAQ|url=http://www.earlycolleges.org/overview.html|publisher=Early College High School Initiative|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eleanor Ruth Duckworth''' (born 1935) is a teacher, teacher educator, and educational theorist.

Duckworth earned her Ph.D. (Docteur en sciences de l'éducation) at the Université de Genève in 1977. She grounds her work in Jean Piaget and Bärbel Inhelder's insights into the nature and development of understanding and intelligence and in their clinical interview method. Duckworth also has been an elementary school teacher. Her participation in the 1960s curriculum development projects Elementary Science Study and African Primary Science Program was germinal for her insights and practices in exploratory methods in teaching and learning. She has conducted teacher education, curriculum development, and program evaluation in the United States, Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia and her native Canada. Duckworth is also a coordinator of Cambridge United for Justice with Peace and a performing modern dancer.

==Short biography==
Duckworth is the daughter of Jack and [[Muriel Duckworth]], Canadian peace workers and social and community activists. She is named after [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. Jack Duckworth, born in 1897, was a highly regarded leader in the national [[YMCA]] movement and an outspoken pacifist from the 1930s until his death in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;See https://www.oxfam.ca/donate/jack-and-murial-duckworth-fund-for-active-global-citizenship&lt;/ref&gt; Muriel Duckworth, born in 1908 (maiden name Ball), who celebrated her hundredth birthday on October 31, 2008, was renowned as a crusader for social justice, women's rights, de-militarization, educational development and fighting poverty. She was one of the 1000 women worldwide nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005.

Duckworth studied ballet in Halifax, Nova Scotia, as a student of Irene Apinee and Jury Gotshalks, and danced in the Gotshalks Halifax Ballet.  She stopped her dance studies at the age of 15, and started again at the age of 58.

She is the sister of Montreal filmmaker [[Martin Duckworth]],&lt;ref name="Cinema Canada"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://povmagazine.com/articles/view/moving-with-the-life|title=Moving with the Life|last=Maurie Alioff and Susan Schouten Levine|date=June 1987|work=[[Cinema Canada]]|publisher=Reprinted in POV Magazine|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nova Scotia businessman and musician John Duckworth.

== (Re-)discovering Piaget ==
Piaget first influenced the child study and [[progressive education]] movement in Europe with publications such as ''{{lang|fr|Le langage et la pensée chez l'enfant}}'' (1923) and ''{{lang|fr|Le jugement et le raisonnement chez l'enfant}}'' (1924), translated into English in the 1920s, and his experiments showing how young children understand size and volume were exhibited in the London [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] in the 1950s. However, Piaget's work was little known in the North American educational community after World War II until Eleanor Duckworth, a student of Piaget at that time, introduced his methods and analysis into the classroom and the US educational research community.

Eleanor Duckworth first met [[Jean Piaget]] in 1957 in Paris at the Sorbonne where she was a graduate student. For the next two years Duckworth studied with [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Bärbel Inhelder]] at the Institut des Sciences de l'Education in Geneva, Switzerland. She served as a research and teaching assistant for the second of those years. She subsequently entered a doctoral program in cognitive psychology at Harvard University, and dropped out. For the years to come, the work with Piaget and Inhelder would have an important impact on her thinking and further development.  She returned to Geneva to finish her doctorate.

At Inhelder's recommendation, Duckworth began to participate in the Elementary Science Study (ESS) in 1962, a curriculum development and science education reform project that grew out of MIT and became the foundation of the organization now known as [[Education Development Center]]. The project was initiated by Jerrold Zacharias and participating scientists and teachers included, among others, David Hawkins, Mike Savage, [[Philip Morrison]], Phylis Morrison, Ben Nichols, Claryce Evans, Lynn Margulis, Marion Walter, David Webster, Ed Prenowitz, Mike Rice, Cap Weston, Elsa Dorfman, and Edith Churchill. The project involved "[putting] physical materials into children's hands from the start and help[ing] each child investigate through these materials the nature of the world around him [stet]" (ESS, 1970, p.&amp;nbsp;7). Teachers and students experimented with natural materials like bulbs, batteries, pendulums or butterflies, ice cubes and earthworms. During her four years as a staff member at the ESS, Duckworth struggled to incorporate the theory and clinical method of Piaget into the work she and her colleagues did in classrooms (Duckworth, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth states: "My colleagues did not seem to be any the worse for not taking Piaget seriously. Nor, I had to admit, did I seem to be any the better. Schools were such complicated places compared with psychology labs that I couldn't find a way to be of any special help. Not only did Piaget seem irrelevant, I was no longer sure that he was right. For a couple of years, I scarcely mentioned him and simply went about the business of trying to be helpful, with no single instance, as I recall, of drawing directly on any of his specific findings" (2006, p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

A breakthrough for communicating Piaget's work to a broader educational community occurred in 1964, when Duckworth acted as the English translator and interpreter of Piaget during a bi-coastal conference at Cornell University and University of California, Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;Verne N. Rockcastle, the conference director of the bi-coastal conference in 1964, wrote in the conference report of the Jean Piaget conferences: "Piaget, when looking over the list of participants at the Cornell conference, noticed with pleasure that Eleanor Duckworth of Educational Services, Inc., was going to attend. She had studied with Piaget and knew both him and his theories well. With little urging she agreed to translate Piaget's lectures for the conference. It soon was apparent that Eleanor Duckworth was a real key to the success of the Cornell conference. She was outstanding not only in her interpretation of Piaget's complex phraseology, but in her fielding and translating of the questions directed at Piaget at the close of each of his lectures. There was not any question but that she should translate at Berkeley as well. Again, the success of the conference was due in large measure to her superb translations" (1964, p. xi).&lt;/ref&gt; Duckworth reported to her colleagues at the ESS about the conference by writing a short paper, "Piaget Rediscovered". This paper gave its name to the book that came out of the conference, a collection of papers on developmental psychology and curriculum development. The book was instrumental in re-awakening interest in Piaget's work among educators.

Deciding to devote herself to education, she sought work as elementary school teacher in Montreal. In 1970 she took a job at the Atlantic Institute of Education, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, as director of "The Lighthouse Project", a curriculum development and teacher education program for the four Atlantic provinces of Canada.

Collaborating with Jeanne Bamberger at the Division for Study and Research in Education at MIT, they initiated "The Teacher Project". During this project Duckworth and Bamberger worked to facilitate research experiences among teachers who worked in elementary schools in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1978. Duckworth continued to work with a smaller group of these same teachers for seven more years. This group, the Moon Group, explored the behaviour of the moon as a practice of learning and teaching.

Duckworth wrote essays based on some of these experiences with Piaget, the Cambridge Teacher Project, the Moon Group, and her own teaching in her landmark book ''The Having of Wonderful Ideas'' (1987|2006).

== The developmentalist tradition ==
Within teacher education in the United States in the twentieth century, Duckworth's contributions relate to a progressive or developmentalist approach. The idea of a teacher acting as a researcher is embraced by the following four traditions of reflective teaching practice: academic, social efficiency, developmentalist and social reconstructivist. The developmentalist tradition considers that the teacher is both a practitioner and a researcher: "The teacher as researcher strand of this tradition has emphasized the need to foster the teacher's experimental attitude toward practice and to help teachers initiate and sustain ongoing inquiries in their own classroom" (Zeichner, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;165).

Duckworth (2006, p. xiii) wrote in her book ''The Having of Wonderful Ideas'' that she built her developmental approach on two foundations very powerful to her: 
#The work of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Bärbel Inhelder]]. Duckworth was a student and colleague in the late 1950s and she acted as the English translator and interpreter of Piaget during his American lectures, until his death in 1980. Two aspects in the work of Piaget and Inhelder were especially important for Duckworth (2005b, pp.&amp;nbsp;258–259): First, the basic idea of ''assimilation'', that is, every person creates meaning on her own, while taking any experience into her own schemes, structures, previous understanding. Second, the clinical interviewing or ''clinical method'', that is, engaging children in talking about their ideas with a researcher.
#Her experience with the Elementary Science Study (ESS) curriculum development program. This program is consistent with the work of Piaget and Inhelder in psychology and it is considered to be a milestone in the history of science education. The Elementary Science Study tackled the following main question: "So how do we present material 'from without' so that the activity that 'the mind itself undergoes' is valuable?" (Duckworth, 2005a, p.&amp;nbsp;142)

As a constructivist who defines teaching as helping people learn, Duckworth emphasizes the importance of engaging learners with phenomena, understanding students' current understandings and trying to facilitate students' own thinking. The central question of Duckworth's (2006: xiv) research over five decades continues to be: "How do people learn and what can anyone do to help?" In the process of investigating this question, she has developed a research method which she has called expanded clinical interviewing, teaching/learning research and critical exploration. These three phrases emerged in the course of her research and are used interchangeably (Duckworth, 2006, p. xv).

== Critical Exploration ==
Bärbel Inhelder first applied the name critical exploration to Piaget's clinical interviewing which included observing children as well as interviewing and interacting with a child who is experimenting and investigating a problem set by the researcher. Inhelder introduced this method to pedagogical contexts (Inhelder, Sinclair &amp; Bovet, 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;18–20). Duckworth (2005b, p.&amp;nbsp;258–259) describes critical exploration as having two facets: curriculum development and pedagogy. In the context of critical exploration, curriculum development means: the teacher is planning how to engage students' minds in exploring the subject matter. Pedagogy constitutes the practice by which teachers invite students to express their thoughts:
{{quote|Critical exploration as a research method requires just as much resourcefulness in finding appropriate materials, questions, and activities as any good curriculum development does. Whether it be poems, mathematical situations, historical documents, liquids, or music, our offerings must provide some accessible entry points, must present the subject matter from different angles, elicit different responses from different learners, open a variety of paths for exploration, engender conflicts, and provide surprises; we must encourage learners to open out beyond themselves, and help them realize that here are other points of view yet to be uncovered – that they have not yet exhausted the thoughts they might have about this matter.|(Duckworth, 2006, p. 140).}}

During critical exploration, exploring goes on in two modes: In one mode, the child explores the subject matter and in the other mode, the researcher-teacher explores the child's thinking. Hence, for the teacher, critical exploration finds itself at the nexus of research and teaching where teacher and learner support each other (Shorr, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;369–370):

{{quote|Critical exploration, then, as a research method, has two aspects: 1) developing a good project for the child to work on; and 2) succeeding in inviting the child to talk about her ideas: putting her at ease, being receptive to all answers; being neutral to the substance of the answer while being encouraging about the fact that the child is thinking and talking; getting the child to keep thinking about the problem, beyond the first thought that comes to her; getting her to take her thinking seriously.|(Duckworth, 2005b, p. 259)}}
Consequently, Duckworth (2008b) suggests that a classroom teacher can take on the role of a researcher. The teacher explores too, by interacting with students' learning. It is the teacher's work to present engaging problems, and attend to students' ways of figuring them out helping them to notice what's interesting. For example, the teacher listens to students explain their ideas and asks them questions that seek to take students' thinking further (Duckworth, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;173–174).

=== The main ideas of the teaching/learning research ===
Outlining her approach, Duckworth (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;173) states: "As a student of Piaget, I was convinced that people must construct their own knowledge and must assimilate new experiences in ways that make sense to them. I knew that, more often than not, simply telling students what we want them to know leaves them cold". Considering learning and teaching, critical exploration stresses the following aspects:
* ''Students bring their prior expectations, interests and knowledge to the learning experience:'' The students' experience and insights are of high value as the development of their personal intelligence emerges through actions and the having of wonderful ideas. To reach deep understanding, students need to start from their own sets of ideas, be engaged in the subject matter and make a connection from the actual problem or subject matter to what they already understand. Consequently, the students do the talking as they explain the sense they are making, while the teacher listens. However, this requires a learning culture that accommodates students in feeling free and safe to say what their emerging ideas are, and that what they say is valued (Duckworth in Meek, 1991). "[B]y opening up to children the many fascinating aspects of the ordinary world and by enabling them to feel that their ideas are worthwhile having and following through, their tendency to have wonderful ideas can be affected in significant ways" (Duckworth, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;12).&lt;ref&gt;"Exploring ideas can only be to the good, even if it takes time. Wrong ideas, moreover, can only be productive. Any wrong idea that is corrected provides far more depth than if one never had a wrong idea to begin with. You master the idea much more thoroughly if you have considered alternatives, tried to work it out in cases where it didn't work, and figured out why it was that it didn't work, all of which takes time" (Duckworth, 2006, p. 70).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Students need something complex that challenges them to explore:'' Students need to engage with the phenomena of study, not schematic substitutes. It is in struggling with complex problems that every learner undergoes the process of constructing their own knowledge. As learners experience internal cognitive conflicts in what they believe about the subject matter, their minds become more deeply engaged with the problem at hand. Learners' efforts in figuring out questions and puzzles are more productive than knowing the right answer because higher order thinking processes are involved. Therefore, teachers of critical exploration value the diverse efforts that students make during their explorations even where these efforts do not arrive at expected answers. In facilitating this investigative work, the questions that are asked over and over again by students and teachers alike are, for example: "What do you notice?" What do you mean?" "How are you thinking about it?" "Why do you think that?" "Is that the same as what (someone else) thought they saw?" "How did you figure that?" "How did you do that?" "How does that fit with what she just said?" "Could you give an example?" The responses that teachers and students give to each other might have the form of: "I don't quite get it." "It doesn't make sense (to me)." "I don't really get that; could you explain it another way?" Hence, most important: It is the students who make sense and understand by trying out their ideas, explaining them to others, and seeing how this holds up in other people's and their own eyes and in the light of the phenomena itself (Duckworth, 2002).
* ''Teacher as facilitator with a researcher mind-set:'' The teacher creates situations and selects environmental resources that get students excited and engaged in learning that is meaningful to them.&lt;ref&gt;A good learning situation "[m]ust permit the child to establish plans to reach a distant goal, while leaving him wide freedom to follow his own routing" (Blanchet, 1977, p. 37 cited in Duckworth, 2006, p. 42). "If we can create situations like this, then differences among children are by definition taken into account – without our having to diagnose in advance each child's level in a dozen domains. We can also be sure that children will take their own individual notions further as they strive to make sense of any situation [...]" (Duckworth, 2006, p. 48).&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher is sensitive to the thoughts and feelings of learners, puts students at ease, engages learners, invites them to talk about their ideas, waits for learners to think and listens and then, reacts to the substance of their answers without judging them. The teacher takes a neutral researcher's stance. Instead of lecturing, the teacher creates situations that put learners into confronting their thinking processes, where they are responsible for their own learning.&lt;ref&gt;There are two aspects to providing occasions for wonderful ideas. One is being willing to accept children's ideas. The other is providing a setting that suggests wonderful ideas to children - different ideas to different children - as they are caught up in intellectual problems that are real to them (Duckworth, 2006, p. 7).&lt;/ref&gt; The teachers' role then, is asking questions like "When you say x, what do you mean by it?" "How would that work if applied to this situation?" "Am I right in understanding your idea, if I say it this way?" to reveal students' thinking and take their own thoughts further. That way, the teacher refrains from signaling to the students what he might expect them to say. Instead, the teacher provides opportunities for learners to reveal their own understanding. The thoughts that learners have become visible through the responses they make including: actions, drawings, gestures, constructions, dialogues and sound, for example. Guiding questions for the teacher himself might be as follows (Duckworth, 2005b, p.&amp;nbsp;261): "What lies behind this response? How may the other children be responding to it? What question shall I ask next, or what experience to offer next, or where to direct their attention next?" The students' work is to make sense of the phenomena of study. The teachers' work is to ensure safe and supportive conditions in the classroom so that the students can take intellectual risks and do their work investigatively.

=== Teacher education ===
If teachers are to teach their students exploratively, they must have experienced learning as explorers themselves (Duckworth, 2006). In the teacher education work that Duckworth does at Harvard University and elsewhere, she provides teachers with the opportunity to live through and think about the phenomena of teaching and learning. She involves teacher education students in the effort to understand somebody else's understanding. She considers it important for teachers to know what their students are understanding, that is: what sense the students are making of the subject matter (Duckworth in Meek, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;32).

In her courses at Harvard University she applies her teaching approach by using critical exploration to teach critical exploration. Her famous T-440 course titled ''Teaching and Learning: "The Having of Wonderful Ideas"'' is usually conducted with two parallel groups, each having up to 50 teacher education students. Duckworth states on her course website: "The course starts from the premise that there are endless numbers of adequate pathways for people to come to understand subject matters. Curriculum and assessment must build on this diversity. A second premise is that every person can get involved with and enjoy and get good at every subject matter."&lt;ref&gt;[https://courses.my.harvard.edu/psp/courses/EMPLOYEE/EMPL/h/?tab=HU_CLASS_SEARCH&amp;SearchReqJSON=%7B%22PageNumber%22%3A1%2C%22PageSize%22%3A%22%22%2C%22SortOrder%22%3A%5B%22IS_SCL_SUBJ_CAT%22%2C%22IS_SCL_DESCR100%22%5D%2C%22Facets%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22Category%22%3A%22HU_SCL_SCHEDULED_BRACKETED_COURSES%22%2C%22SearchPropertiesInResults%22%3Atrue%2C%22FacetsInResults%22%3Atrue%2C%22SaveRecent%22%3Afalse%2C%22TopN%22%3A%22%22%2C%22SearchText%22%3A%22having%20of%20wonderful%22%2C%22DeepLink%22%3Afalse%7D See]&lt;/ref&gt;

In her university teaching Duckworth (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;9 and 173–192) tries to engage teacher education students with three major kinds of teaching and learning phenomena:
# Films and/or (life) demonstrations with one or two children or adolescents. In this way teacher education students can observe children/adults learning while instructors are teaching by engaging those learners and by listening and understanding the explanations of those learners;
# Teacher education students carry out a similar inquiry outside of classtime, where they meet with one or two people who are their practice learners. In this way, each teacher education student creates, on his own, a trial critical exploration for learners and then reflects on it in writing;
# Teacher education students learn as a group about a particular subject other than teaching and learning. Through this exploratory study by the group, the teacher education students are learning in the same way that the children in their classes will be learning. This subject could be from any area of study such as: pendulums, mathematical permutations, history, arts and poems.

In the summer of 2013 Professor Duckworth went to the south of England as the guest of honor of the holistic [[Brockwood Park School]] for the education conference taking place there entitled "When is Teaching? Getting in or out of the way at the right time".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9971">'''Faith de Villiers''' (21 October 1920 – October 2001) was a South African dancer, producer, choreographer, teacher, company director, and adjudicator. Active primarily in the northern province of the Transvaal (since divided into Gauteng, Mpumalanga, and Limpopo), she is recognized as one of the most influential pioneers of ballet in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Marina Grut, "De Villiers, Faith," in ''The History of Ballet in South Africa'' (Cape Town: Human &amp; Rousseau, 1982), p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and training==
Faith de Villiers was born in Johannesburg, the largest city in the Transvaal and the center of gold mining and industry in South Africa. Her father was a descendant of French Hugenots who had come to the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] in the days of early settlement. Most such families learned Afrikaans and were assimilated into Afrikaner culture, because of similarities in their Protestant religious beliefs, and most had stayed in the Cape Province. Faith's ancestors had moved north to Johannesburg, however, and had become resolutely Anglophonic and Anglophilic, speakers of English and lovers of all things British. She began her dance training at an early age, with Delphine Thompson, a pupil of one of the founders of the Cecchetti Society in South Africa. At age 12, she entered the Johannesburg Cambrian Society National Eisteddfod and was judged best all-around dancer in the 11- to 13-year-old category. The gold medal, presented to her by [[Dulcie Howes]], the adjudicator and a national celebrity, was accompanied by a bursary that started her off on her career in dance.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Glasstone, ''Dulcie Howes: Pioneer of Ballet in South Africa'' (Cape Town: Human &amp; Rousseau, 1996), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 18, de Villiers got a temporary dancing job with the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] when it toured South Africa for three months in 1938. Her earnings allowed her to travel to London, where she studied under [[Margaret Craske]], a teacher of the [[Cecchetti method]] of ballet training, and Igor Schwezoff, a Russian who had trained at the Leningrad Choreographic School. At the time, war clouds were gathering over continental Europe, and it did not seem prudent for her to remain much longer in England.

==Professional career==
De Villiers returned to Johannesburg in 1939 and became ballet mistress, choreographer, and ensemble director for African Consolidated Theatres. After some years, she formed her own performing group, Ballet Theatre, with Joyce van Geems, in 1947. It was the first of several such troupes that she would initiate. The next year, she married and moved to Cape Town, where she began teaching at the school of the South African National Ballet, producing ballets, and touring the group to nearby Stellenbosch and Paarl. She returned frequently to Johannesburg, despite the great distance, to continue her work with African Consolidated Theatres. With her husband and child, she moved back to her home city in 1952 and continued producing ballets for performances in cities and towns throughout the Transvaal and in neighboring Mozambique. When [[Yvonne Mounsey]] returned to South Africa from New York in 1959, de Villiers joined her in founding the Johannesburg City Ballet, of which she became artistic director in 1961. The company was renamed Ballet Transvaal and then, in 1963, PACT Ballet, so called for the Performing Arts Council of the Transvaal and known in Afrikaans as TRUK Ballet, for the Transvaalse Raad vir die Uitvoerende Kunste.&lt;ref&gt;David Poole, "The South African Way: Four Professional Ballet Companies Subsidized by the Government," ''Dance and Dancers'' (London), May 1969, pp. 18ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a government subsidy, PACT Ballet became a fully professional, bilingual company, guided by de Villiers as artistic manager from 1964 until 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Eve Borland, "CAPAB and PACT Ballet, South Africa," ''Dance Gazette'' (London), no. 188 (March 1985), 29-32. Traces the development of the two companies from 1964 to 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; During her five-year tenure in this position, she was responsible for bringing the great French ballerina [[Yvette Chauviré]] to dance ''Giselle'' in theaters in Johannesburg and nearby Pretoria.&lt;ref&gt;Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell, "PACT Ballet," in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Dance'' (Oxford University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; She hired [[Alexander Bennett (dancer)|Alexander Bennett]], a former Royal Ballet principal, to be ballet master and to produce ''Coppélia, Aurora's Wedding'' (''Aurora se Huwelik''), and [[Frederick Ashton]]'s ''Les Patineurs''. In 1965, Yvonne Mounsey staged a version of the ''pas de deux'' from [[Jerome Robbins]]'s ''Interplay'' (''Heen-en-weer-spel''); Peter Clegg recreated Ashton's ''Façade''; and de Villiers herself mounted [[Walter Gore]]'s production of ''Casse Noisette'' (''The Nutcracker, Die Neutkraker'') for the Christmas season at the splendid, new Civic Theatre.&lt;ref&gt; Marina Grut and Jonathan Horwitz, "South Africa: Ballet," in ''International Encyclopedia of Dance'', edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 5, p. 654.&lt;/ref&gt; She brought [[Roland Petit]] and Zizi Jeanmaire to Johannesburg to stage ''Carmen'' and [[Francoise Adret|Françoise Adret]] to choreograph a new ''Cinderella'', with [[Galina Samsova]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Conyers, "I Shall Remember Her Running," ''Ballet Review'' (Brooklyn, N.Y.), 1.5 (1966), pp. 13-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ballets, mounted with striking sets and sumptuous costumes, were popular successes.&lt;ref&gt;Performing Arts Council of the Transvaal, ''Decade: A Pictorial Review'' (Johannesburg: PACT, 1973). Covers the period 1963-1972).&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Frank Staff]] arrived as resident choreographer, he mounted his charming ''Peter and the Wolf,'' originally created for Ballet Rambert in London, and created seven new works for the company, including ''Five Faces of Euridice'' (''Vyf Fasette van Euridice'', 1965), ''Czernyana III'' (1966), and ''Raka'' (1967).&lt;ref&gt;Theater programs and playbills, PACT/TRUK Ballet, Civic Theatre, Johannesburg, and Aula Theatre, Pretoria, 1965-1967. Archives, Joburg Ballet, Biccard Street, Johannesburg; Jerome Robbins Dance Division, New York Public Library for the Performing Arts; and other major collections of dance materials in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under de Villiers's aegis, PACT Ballet performed in many major cities of South Africa, including Pretoria, Bloemfontein, Kimberley, Durban, and Cape Town. It also traveled across the Limpopo River to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where it was presented by the Rhodesian National Ballet in performances in Salisbury (now Harare), Bulawayo, and Gwelo (now Gweru). Concurrent with administering such activity, de Villiers began a major outreach to Transvaal schools and the general public. A grant from the provincial Department of Arts and Sciences allowed her to tour two groups of company members ("the Midgets" and "the Giants") to perform programs of ''divertissements'' and short ballets on stages in school auditoriums and town halls in ''dorpies'' on the Highveld and the Bushveld of the vast Transvaal.&lt;ref&gt;Grut, "De Villiers, Faith," in ''The History of Ballet in South Africa'' (1982), p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works presented was ''Allegro di Concierto'' (1965), a work evocative of a storm at sea, set by de Villiers to the piano music of Enrique Granados. Besides acting as choreographer, administrator, and impresario, de Villiers was a cheerful "mother hen" of her company, mindful of the welfare of her dancers and their futures. She was mentor to several South African ballerinas, including Sandra Lipman and Noleen Nicol, who went on to international careers in European companies, and Dawn Weller, who had a decades-long career in PACT Ballet as dancer, artistic director, and prima ballerina.&lt;ref&gt;Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell, "Weller, Dawn," in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Dance'' (Oxford University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related activities and awards==
As chair of the Cecchetti Society of Southern Africa for twenty-five years, and as a senior major examiner on both the national and international circuits, de Villiers was devoted to supporting the Cecchetti method of teaching ballet. Recipient of the Enrico Cecchetti Medal in 1971, she was also honored with the Imperial Medal by the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, London, in recognition of her service to its Cecchetti Branch. She received the Southern African Cecchetti dedication award in 1996 and continued to promote ballet during her close involvement with the Val Whyte Bursary.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Myburgh, "Faith de Villiers," Cecchetti International Classical Ballet, Pioneers, website, http://www.cicb.org/pioneers. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, she acted as adjudicator, with Dulcie Howes, of the Choreographic Award sponsored by the South African government,&lt;ref&gt;Grut, "De Villiers, Faith," in ''The History of Ballet in South Africa'' (1982), p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1948, de Villiers married Thomas Renwick, an executive with the Otis Elevator Company, with whom she had one child. After both he and she retired, they moved from Johannesburg to Umhlanga Rocks, a seaside community north of Durban (now eThukwini) in KwaZulu-Natal. An avid gardener, a quixotic bridge player, and a steadfast friend to many, she was a woman of optimism, good will, and apparently boundless energy.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Fouché, "Faith de Villiers," Cecchetti International Classical Ballet, Pioneers, website, http://www.cicb.org/pioneers. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Her passionate enthusiasm for ballet was undiminished until the end of her life in 2001.

==History==

===Early schools and the Varkey Group===
GEMS Education has its roots in a family tutoring business in [[Dubai]] started by Indian-born teachers K.S. and Mariama Varkey in 1959.&lt;ref name=bhatia&gt;Bhatia, Asha.

''[[Gulf News]]''. 9 March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of oil in Dubai in 1966 brought in many foreign workers to the undeveloped emirate, including many from the [[Indian subcontinent]]. With the increased demand for an English-language education for the children of Indian expatriates, the Varkeys founded [[Our Own English High School]] in Dubai in 1968.&lt;ref name=education&gt;[http://www.nriinternet.com/MIDDLE%20EAST/Dubai/Sunny_Varkey/4_Education_profit%20.htm "Education for profit in the Arab world"].

''[[New York Times]]''. 26 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

When in 1980 local authorities insisted that Our Own English High School be housed in a purpose-built facility, the Varkeys' son [[Sunny Varkey]] took over the operation of the school, which taught less than 400 students at the time.&lt;ref name=hamdan&gt;Hamdan, Sara.

==Structure and philosophy==
GEMS schools are established in various price brackets, to serve all markets and income levels.&lt;ref name=hamdan /&gt;&lt;ref name=woodward /&gt; The more expensive schools have more spacious grounds and amenities such as golf and tennis facilities, and smaller class sizes.&lt;ref name=guttenplan /&gt;&lt;ref name=chalk&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/2628740 "Chalk, talk and customer service"]. ''[[The Economist]]''. 29 April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Educational quality is maintained in the budget-range schools by using excellent teachers, by efficiency and economisation on time and space, and by capitalising on its broad experience: the huge network of GEMS schools shares resources and information and provides training to teachers across the whole system.&lt;ref name=lewis /&gt;&lt;ref name=woodward /&gt;&lt;ref name=chalk /&gt; When entering into new markets GEMS schools also benefit from local partners who understand local conditions; the partners provide local knowledge that may not be obvious through standard market research.&lt;ref name=kerr /&gt;

GEMS schools aim to instill students with universal values, and are geared to form graduates who are global citizens with leadership qualities.&lt;ref name=hamdan /&gt;&lt;ref name=hui /&gt;&lt;ref name=woodward /&gt; GEMS aims to equip children to live in a multicultural environment, and stresses the importance of giving back to others both locally and globally.&lt;ref name=hamdan /&gt;&lt;ref name=peschardt&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT5_ppglB90 ''Peschardt's Business People'' – Segment: Sunny Varkey].

Following its initial years catering mainly to immigrant Indian workers, GEMS grew rapidly in Dubai. As the emirate developed into an international hub, the expat demographics shifted from short-term workers from a few countries to longterm expat residents with their entire families from countries around the world. GEMS adapted with schools for each demographic, varying and adding new curricula and price ranges for each income level and nationality.&lt;ref name="guttenplan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=block/&gt;&lt;ref name=six/&gt;&lt;ref name=wharton&gt;[http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/gemss-sunny-varkey-we-offer-different-curricula-at-varying-price-points "GEMS’s Sunny Varkey: 'We Offer Different Curricula at Varying Price Points'"].

[[File:Gravity Discovery Centre (logo).jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Gravity Discovery Centre logo]]

The '''Gravity Discovery Centre and Observatory''' is a "hands-on" Science education, astronomy, Aboriginal culture and tourist centre, situated on the site of the Gravity precinct, near [[Gingin]], north of [[Perth, Western Australia]].

The centre is operated by The Gravity Discovery Centre Foundation Board Inc and provides information and displays regarding [[physics]], [[astronomy]] and Australian Aboriginal Culture specialising in [[gravity]] and [[cosmology]]. The site of the public centre is located in pristine Western Australian bushland. 

The Department of Biodiversity Conservation and Attractions manages the bushland surrounding the Discovery Centre and the observatory, and strives to keep the area untouched (from weeds, litter, etc.). The surrounding area is abundant in seasonal wildflowers.

In 2005 the Gravity Discovery Centre was awarded the [[Eureka Prize]] for "promoting [the] understanding of science."&lt;ref&gt;http://eureka.australianmuseum.net.au/7537F9BD-EB56-2006-84C9841C04AA1401&lt;/ref&gt; The GDC is a significant Western Australian asset.

==The Leaning Tower of Gingin==

[[File:Leaning tower of gingin.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Leaning Tower of Gingin]]

The Leaning Tower of Gingin is a purpose built {{convert|45|m|ft|}} tall steel [[inclined tower]], designed so that visitors can recreate the experiments of [[Galileo Galilei]]. There are 222&amp;nbsp;steps to the top from where balloons filled with water can be dropped through chutes. The tower leans at an angle of 15&amp;nbsp;degrees and held in place by 180&amp;nbsp;tons of [[concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gravitycentre.com.au/leaning-tower/|title=Leaning Tower of Gingin - Gravity Discovery Centre|work=Gravity Discovery Centre|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drop tower is also used by the [[YouTube]] channel "How Ridiculous" for various drop tests.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/user/whoisjimmy/featured&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brett Christensen==
Brett M. Christensen, a resident of [[Bundaberg]], [[Australia]], worked as a [[caravan park]] cleaner before he founded Hoax-Slayer.com in August 2003. He was inspired to do so after being convinced that the "Budweiser Frogs virus" really existed, only to discover later that it did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/hoax-slayer-puts-the-bite-on-vampires-of-the-cyber-world-20091125-jrwz.html | title=Hoax slayer puts the bite on vampires of the cyber world | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=26 November 2009 | accessdate=18 May 2014 | author=Elliott, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes most of the site's articles, but two of his three sons, according to him, "help maintain the website and do invaluable work behind the scenes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoax-slayer.com/about.html About Hoax Slayer]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to debunking hoaxes, Christensen has noted that many of them are "loosely derived" from real events. "For example, in Australia in 1999 a woman claimed to have been assaulted by criminals who used a chemical disguised as perfume to disable her. Warnings about that incident, which may not have been true to begin with, soon spread to the internet and have circulated ever since," he told the Guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jun/11/women.ukcrime | title=Beware of the hoax | work=The Guardian | date=10 June 2008 | accessdate=18 May 2014 | author=Groskop, Viv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Gonzaga McKenna''', [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|CFC]] (1922 – 28 July 1973) was an [[United States|American]] educator and member of the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers]], a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[religious institute]]. He served as the fifth President of [[Iona College (New York)|Iona College]] in [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

== Early life and education ==
McKenna was born in 1922 in New York City, where he was raised with a sister, Mary.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/30/archives/joseph-g-mkenna-iona-expresident.html|title=JOSEPH G. M'KENNA, IONA EX‐PRESIDENT|last=Times|first=Special To The New York|date=1973-07-30|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers]] in 1936 at the age of 14.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1951 he graduated from [[Fordham University]] with a [[master's degree]], and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in 1955 from [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He additionally earned a bachelor's degree and a second master's.

== Academic career ==
After graduating college, [[Brother (Christian)|Brother]] McKenna began teaching at [[All Hallows High School|All Hallows Institute]] in 1942, and later taught at [[Rice High School (Manhattan, New York)|Rice High School]], [[Iona Preparatory School]], and [[Power Memorial Academy]] over the next eight years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1950, he became a mathematics professor at Iona College, and two years later was appointed [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the college.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He served in that capacity until 1957, when he left New York to found [[Catholic Memorial School|Catholic Memorial High School]] in [[West Roxbury]], [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], the first Christian Brothers school in [[New England]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He served as principal there until 1963.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== President of Iona College ===
McKenna returned to Iona College in 1963, and served there as vice president until 1965, when he became the college's 5th president.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iona.edu/About/Office-of-the-President/Past-Presidents.aspx|title=Iona College – About: Office of the President|website=www.iona.edu|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his leadership, the college notably changed from an [[Men's colleges in the United States|all-male institution]] to a [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]] college.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.hrvh.org/veridian/cgi-bin/senylrc?a=d&amp;d=bronxvillereviewpressreporterBRONXVILLE19681128.1.5#|title=The Feminine Touch To Be Added At Iona|last=|first=|date=28 November 1968|work=The Bronxville Review Press Reporter|access-date=13 November 2016|via=HRHV Historical Newspapers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision, made by the college's board of trustees, was announced by McKenna in November 1968.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The change in policy, which would take effect with the first female students entering Iona as freshmen in September 1969, was explained by McKenna in a press release:&lt;blockquote&gt;The change is not as drastic as one may assume. The entrance of women into the other divisions of Iona that took place during the past four years was preparing the college, whether we realized it or not, for the recent decision of the board."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The decision for Iona to adopt coeducation was part of a national trend, with 62 single-sex colleges going coed in 1968 alone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Within the Iona and regional communities, the change was met with mixed but mostly positive reactions. The mayor of New Rochelle, where the college is located, expressed his approval, as did several Iona professors, and students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; McKenna's predecessor as President of Iona College, Br. Richard B. Power, said, "While I do not like to see Iona become a coeducational institution, I can understand the decision of the board of trustees and I look forward with interest to this latest development in the history of the college."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, the representative of the junior class express student acceptance of the decision, while noting the possible lack of sufficient space to house female boarders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1971, McKenna resigned as president due to ill health, but continued to teach graduate students in the school of business.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to his work at Iona College, he also served as assistant to the superior of the Eastern American Province of the Congregation of Christian Brothers.

== Death and legacy ==

'''Linda Susanne Gottfredson''' (née '''Howarth'''; born June 24, 1947) is an American psychologist and writer. She is professor emeritus of [[educational psychology]] at the [[University of Delaware]] and co-director of the Delaware-[[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] Project for the Study of Intelligence and Society. Gottfredson's work has been influential in shaping U.S. public and private policies regarding [[affirmative action]], hiring quotas, and "[[race-norming]]" on aptitude tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/19/weekinreview/the-nation-race-norming-tests-becomes-a-fiery-issue.html |title=The Nation; 'Race Norming' Tests Becomes a Fiery Issue |last=Kilborn |first=Peter T. |website=The New York Times |publication-date=19 May 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is on the boards of the [[International Society for the Study of Individual Differences]] (ISSID), the [[International Society for Intelligence Research]] (ISIR), and the editorial boards of the scientific journals ''[[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]]'', ''[[Learning and Individual Differences]]'', and ''[[Society (journal)|Society]]''. Gottfredson has received research grants worth $267,000 from the [[Pioneer Fund]], an organization which has been described as "racist" and "white supremacist".&lt;ref&gt;Avner Falk.

Gottfredson was born in [[San Francisco]] on June 24th, 1947. She is a third generation university faculty member. Her father, Jack A. Howarth (died 2006), was a faculty at [[University of California, Davis|U.C. Davis]] School of Veterinary Medicine, as was his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/inmemoriam/html/jackhowrath.html|title=Jack Howrath|website=senate.universityofcalifornia.edu|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wainer|first=Howard|last2=Robinson|first2=Daniel H.|date=September 2009|title=Linda S.

They received bachelor's degrees in psychology in 1969 from [[University of California, Berkeley]], then worked in the [[Peace Corps]] in [[Malaysia]] until 1972. She also taught in schools for the disadvantaged for a time when she was young.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0765804972&amp;id=VLtTKixjfYQC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;]{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They both went to graduate school at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where she received a Ph.D. in sociology in 1977.

Gottfredson took a position at Hopkins' Center for Social Organization of Schools and investigated issues of occupational segregation and typology based on skill sets and intellectual capacity. She married [[Robert A. Gordon]], who worked in a related area at Hopkins, and they divorced by the mid-90s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jhu.edu/~gazette/1994/nov2894/gordon.html]{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Gottfredson participated in a conference called "The [[General intelligence factor|g Factor]] in Employment Testing". The papers presented were published in the December 1986 issue of the ''[[Journal of Vocational Behavior]]'', which she edited. In 1986, Gottfredson was appointed Associate Professor of Educational Studies at the [[University of Delaware]], Newark. 

In 1989, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that one of Gottfredson's presentations was cited favorably by an article in the [[National Association for the Advancement of White People]]'s magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1989/11/16/pioneer-funds-controversial-projects/0f05cde6-6586-462d-acfa-cfd3ae65567e/ |title=PIONEER FUND'S CONTROVERSIAL PROJECTS |last=ANDERSON |first=JACK |date=1989-11-16 |work=Washington Post |access-date=2017-12-24 |last2=ATTA |first2=DALE VAN |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That year, she presented a series of papers on general [[intelligence]] factor and employment. Gottfredson has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We now have out there what I call the egalitarian fiction that all groups are equal in intelligence. We have social policy based on that fiction. For example, the [[1991 Civil Rights Act]] codified ''Griggs vs. Duke Power'', which said that if you have disproportionate hiring by race, you are prima facie -- that's prima facie evidence of racial discrimination. ...Differences in intelligence have real world effects, whether we think they're there or not, whether we want to wish them away or not. And we don't do anybody any good, certainly not the low-IQ people, by denying that those problems exist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110525184528/http://aad.english.ucsb.edu/docs/PBS-oct94.htm "Race, IQ, Success and Charles Murray"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She was promoted to full professor at the University of Delaware in 1990. 

In 1992, after two and a half years of debate and protest, the University of Delaware's administration reached a settlement that once again allowed Gottfredson and [[Jan Blits]] to continue receiving research funding from the Pioneer Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/12397/title/U--Delaware-Reaches-Accord-On-Race-Studies/ |title=U. Delaware Reaches Accord On Race Studies |last=Kaufman |first=Ron |website=The Scientist |publication-date=6 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gottfredson's research and views have stirred considerable controversy, especially her testimony on public affirmative action policy and her defense of ''[[The Bell Curve]],'' in particular a statement she wrote, ''[[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]]'', which was signed by 51 colleagues and published in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]].''&lt;ref name="gottfredson"&gt;Gottfredson, Linda (December 13, 1994). [[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]]. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', p. A18.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, she has written a number of articles on [[race and intelligence]], especially as it applies to occupational qualification.

Gottfredson has been very critical of psychologist [[Robert Sternberg]], arguing against his position that there is a "[[practical intelligence]]" that is separate from the "analytical intelligence" measured by [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/03/science/scientist-at-work-robert-sternberg-his-goal-making-intelligence-tests-smarter.html |title=His Goal: Making Intelligence Tests Smarter |last=Goode |first=Erica |website=The New York Times |publication-date=3 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Museum of Sex by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|New York City's [[Museum of Sex]]]]
A '''sex museum''' is a [[museum]] that displays [[erotic art]], historical [[sexual aid]]s, and documents on the history of [[erotica]]. They were popular in Europe at the end of the 1960s and during the 1970s, the era of the [[sexual revolution]].
Since the 1990s, these museums are often called '''erotic museums''' or '''erotic art museums''' instead of sex museums.

== Notable sex museums ==

=== North America ===

'''Maria Kristina Franck''' (2 February 1771 – 17 April 1847) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[actress]] and drama teacher.  She was a member of the pioneer generation of the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]], and belonged to the first stars of the theater.  She has been referred to as her country's first native dramatic [[tragedienne]].  She was the principal of the theatre school ''[[Dramatens elevskola]]'' in 1819-23.  During her last years on stage, she was known under her name as married, Ruckman.

== Life ==

Maria Franck was the daughter of a bricklayer journeyman, Johan Franck, and Brita Lundström.

In 1784, she was enrolled as a student of the [[Royal Swedish Opera]].  Her mentors where [[Marie Louise Marcadet]] and [[Jacques Marie Boutet|Monvel]], members of the [[French Theater of Gustav III|French theatre]]. Monvel where reportedly impressed by her talent and she was trained as an actress exclusively for speaking drama and not as a singer of opera.

===Career===

In 1788, Maria Franck was contracted as a "First actress" of the Royal Dramatic Theatre, which was founded that year.  She was as such also a member of the actors board of directors, which managed the theater until 1803.&lt;ref&gt;Henrikson, Alf, Fram till Nybroplan: om Kungliga Dramatiska teatern, Wiken, Höganäs, 1988 {{ISBN|91-7024-445-6}} (in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Franck achieved great success foremost as a tragedienne, and as such, she has been referred to as the most important link between her mentor, the tragedinne Marie Louise Marcadet, and the famous tragedienne of the 19th-century Swedish theater, [[Sara Torsslow]].&lt;ref&gt;M Christina Ruckman, urn:sbl:6972, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Ingeborg Nordin Hennel), hämtad 2018-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt;  She did occasionally play comedy as well, and one of her most acclaimed roles was as Mrs Dorsan in Den svartsjuka hustrun ('Jealous Wife') by [[Desforges]].  She also performed an occasional minor singing part at the opera, as the staff of the Royal theaters (the Royal Swedish Opera and the Royal Dramatic Theatre) was formally available for both stages.  She is known to have made occasional tours in the country.    During the regency government years of Gustav IV Adolf (1792–96), she had rose to become one of the most valuable members of the Royal Dramatic Theatre, which is illustrated by the fact that her income from the theater belonged to the elite of the actresses there.&lt;ref&gt;M Christina Ruckman, urn:sbl:6972, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Ingeborg Nordin Hennel), hämtad 2018-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Franck enjoyed great respect as an artist, and the theater director G F Åkerhjelm respectfully noted her "enlightened and experienced judgement" as well as her "excellent ability and her well deserved fame".&lt;ref&gt;M Christina Ruckman, urn:sbl:6972, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Ingeborg Nordin Hennel), hämtad 2018-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt;  She reportedly acted with a deep feeling and intensity, and a control over her [[mimic]], which was never melodramatic.

Her career lasted longer than most actors of her generation: most of her generation of actors retired after the 1809-10 season, while she remained until 1818. During her last years on the stage, she was criticized for being to melodramatic in her way of acting; she acted in accordance with the French school, which had by then became unfashionable.  In 1818, she retired with a full pension.

Maria Franck had, in parallel with her acting career, given lessons in [[declamation]], and in 1819, the year following her retirement from the stage, she was engaged as the principal of the acting school ''[[Dramatens elevskola]]'', a position she kept until 1823.  She is known as the mentor of [[Sara Torsslow]] and [[Charlotta Eriksson]].

In 1808, at the age of thirty-nine, Maria Franck married the eleven years younger [[engraver]] [[Johan Gustav Ruckman]] (1783–1862).  Some encyclopedias therefore list her as Kristina Ruckman, as this was her name during the last ten years of her career.  She became the mother of the painter [[Maria Ruckman]] (1810–1896).  In contrast to most actors of her generation, which often had financial problems, Maria Franck was reportedly well off during her retirement, although this may have been in part because of her husband, who was a successful engraver.

===Roles===

Among her parts were "One of the pleasures" in ''Armide'' by Gluck (season 1786–87), Maria in ''Gustaf Adolf och Ebba Brahe'' (Gustaf Adolf and Ebba Brahe) by Gustav III (1787–88), Flattery in ''Alcides inträde i världen'' (The arrival of Alcide in to the world) by [[Johann Christian Friedrich Hæffner|Haeffner]] (1793–94), Theodora in ''De gamla friarna'' (The old suitors) by Dalayrac (1795–96), Antiope in ''Renaud'' by Haeffner (1800–01), Sabina in ''Den förmente prinsen'' (The supposed Prince) (1807–08), Madame de Veronne in ''Ambroise'' (1812–13), Gertrud in ''Den Schweiziska familjen'' (The Swiss family) (1815–16) and the abbess in ''Nunnorna'' (The [[nun]]s).

Her most noted performances was Thilda in ''Oden'', Celestina and the [[Abess]] in ''Korsfararne'' (Crusaders) by Kotzebue, and the leading parts in ''Virginia'' by Paykull, ''Johanna af Montfaucon'' by Kotzebue and Mrs Dorsan in ''Den svartsjuka hustrun'' (The jealous wife); the latest one (1808) was considered to be her greatest triumph.

The center was directed by [[F. David Peat]], who co-authored the book ''[[Science, Order, and Creativity]]'' with theoretical physicist [[David Bohm]].&lt;ref&gt;David Bohm, F. David Peat: ''Science, Order and Creativity'', 1987, Routledge, 2nd ed. 2000: {{ISBN|0-415-17182-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center has hosted, with the support of its renowned ''fellows'' from [[academia]] and the arts, the academy ''Accademia dei Pari''. It hosts international conferences on the role of trust and ethics in the world of economics and business, and conferences on the relationship between religion and science.

== Origin and aims ==
It was created by F. David Peat and Maureen Doolan in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paricenter.com/biographies/doolan.php Maureen Doolan], biography, Pari Center&lt;/ref&gt; with the support and assistance of external advisors, of the people of Pari, of Pari's village association Sette Colli and of the ''comune di Civitella-Paganico''.

The center is dedicated to education, learning and research and fosters an [[interdisciplinary]] approach linking science, the arts, ethics and spirituality. Above all, the Pari Center for New Learning is dedicated to the principle of "the [[spirit of place]]".&lt;ref name="aboutpari"&gt;[http://www.paricenter.com/programs/courses/about%20Pari.php The Pari Center for New Learning] (downloaded 17 March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Its location in a [[medieval]] village provides a setting for visitors of the center to pause and think about the future and the values, meaning and direction of [[contemporary society]]. The founders intend the wooded countryside and traditional farming methods in the surroundings of the center to draw attention to the importance of [[ecology|ecological]] considerations in comparison to progress and [[consumerism]].&lt;ref name="aboutpari"/&gt;

The Pari Center takes a "gentle" approach to learning, emphasizing human interaction in simple, pleasant surroundings without the intrusion of unnecessary technology. The underlying philosophy and approach is that of ''[[F. David Peat#Gentle Action|Gentle Action]]'' laid out in the book by David Peat of the same title.&lt;ref&gt;F.

The center's activities include residential courses and conferences that reflect the Center's philosophy, opportunities for scholars and researchers to spend extended periods in Pari as well as [[mentoring]] given by David Peat and other members of the Center's faculty.

The center hosts several courses or seminars every year. 

It has hosted the ''Accademia dei Pari'', the name of which has a double meaning in Italian language, signifying both the ''academy of the people of Pari'' and ''the academy of equals''. The fellows of the academy include theoretical physicist [[Basil Hiley]] who collaborated over decades with David Bohm, art historian [[Deborah Klimburg-Salter]] who has studied the impact of the [[Sanghata Sutra]], theoretical physicist [[Ignazio Licata]], astronomer and space scientist [[Roger Malina]], physicist [[Roy McWeeny]] and [[Paavo Pylkkänen]] who has published articles on [[consciousness]] with Basil Hiley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paricenter.com/accademia/fellows/index.php Fellows of the Accademia dei Pari], Pari Center&lt;/ref&gt;

It has run international conferences on the role of trust and ethics in the world of economics and business&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethics.paricenter.com/en/conference/papers/papers02 Ethical choices in society, the economy, and the environment], May 5–6, Siena, Italy. ''Etica, Finanza ad Ambiente'' and ''Pari Center for New Learning'' (downloaded 17 March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as conferences on the [[relationship between religion and science]]; one of these is documented in the book ''The Pari Dialogues: Essays in Science, Religion, Society and the Arts'' of 2008 by F. David Peat.&lt;ref&gt;F. David peat: ''The Pari Dialogues: Essays in Science, Religion, Society and the Arts'', 2008, {{ISBN|978-88-901960-5-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, the Pari Center for New Learning hosted a conference on ''The Legacy of David Bohm'', which included many collaborators and early students of Bohm as participants.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the characterization of their work together by Joseph Jaworski in chapter "Journey to Pari" of his book ''Source: The Inner Path of Knowledge Creation'', Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with organisations in Berlin, London, Stockholm, Tromso and Lisbon, the Pari Center for New Learning is partner in the project ''UniGrowCity'', for which it hosted a members' meeting in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paricenter.com/library/papers/unigrowcityreport.php ''Unigrowcity: experience  based learning for a more sustainable city of the future''], Report, Pari Center for New Learning&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unigrowcity.org/pari-meeting/ Pari Meeting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514093228/http://www.unigrowcity.org/pari-meeting/ |date=2013-05-14 }}, November 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The project, intended to address experienced-based learning for a more [[sustainable city]] of the future, was initiated by six organisations in six European countries and is part of the [[Grundtvig programme]] on [[adult education]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.programmallp.it/lkmw_file/LLP///Esiti%202011/GRU_esiti_partenariati_%202011_agosto.pdf GRUNDTVIG partenariatidi apprendimento 2011], Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) (in Italian language)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/education/lifelong-learning-programme/doc86_en.htm Grundtvig: practical learning for adults], European Commission&lt;/ref&gt;

The center is associated with ''Pari Publishing'', a small [[publishing house]] specialized in science, religion, society, psychology, linguistics and the arts, managed by Eleanor Peat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shantena.com/en/paricenter/ Shantena: Pari Center for New Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paripublishing.com/en/home Pari Publishing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715044235/http://www.paripublishing.com/en/home |date=2011-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paripublishing.com/en/about/who Who we are] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715044611/http://www.paripublishing.com/en/about/who |date=2011-07-15 }}, Pari Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
Three times in 2003, 2004 and 2006, the Pari Dialogues hosted by the Pari Center for New Learning were awarded the ''Local Societies Initiative Supplemental Grant Award'' by the [[Metanexus Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metanexus.net/resources/networks/europe?page=2 Pari Dialogues on Religion and Science, Pari Center for New Learning, Pari, Grosseto], [[Metanexus Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The project assembles digital collections of [[humanities]] resources. It is hosted by the department of [[Classics]]. The project is [[mirror website|mirrored]] by the [[Max Planck Society]] in [[Berlin]], Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ Berlin Perseus mirror] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127080511/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ |date=2010-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/ Chicago Perseus mirror]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The project was founded in 1987 to collect and present materials for the study of [[ancient Greece]]. It has published two [[CD-ROM]]s and established the Perseus Digital Library on the [[World Wide Web]] in 1995. The project has expanded its original scope; current collections cover Greco-Roman classics and the [[English Renaissance]]. Other materials, such as the papers of [[Edwin Bolles]] and the history of Tufts University, have been moved into the [[Tufts Digital Library]].

The editor-in-chief of the project is [[Gregory Crane]], the Tufts Winnick Family Chair in Technology and Entrepreneurship. He has held that position since the founding of the Perseus Project.

== Text format ==
Ancient Greek works in Perseus are stored as [[beta code]], although they may be reformatted for display into a variety of transcription systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Help/fonthelp.html Greek Font Display Help]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Postgraduate Training in Education (disambiguation)}}
The '''Postgraduate Diploma in Education''' ('''PGDE'''), also known as a '''Graduate Diploma of Education''' ('''GradDipEd'''), is a one-year postgraduate course in several countries including [[Australia]], [[Ghana]], [[New Zealand]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]] and [[Zimbabwe]] for existing [[bachelor's degree]] holders leading to become a qualified teacher.

The [[professional certification|qualification]] is normally taught at a [[university]] or other [[higher education]] institution, though much of the course time is spent on placements in local schools. For example, in the Hong Kong programmes, most schools will have lesson time for about 20 weeks, and another 14 weeks (usually taken in 6 weeks for the first semester and 8 weeks for the second semester) for placements.

In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the former ''Higher Diploma in Education'' (H.Dip.Ed.) was renamed as the PGDE from 2007 onwards.

The [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education]] (PGCE) is the equivalent of the PGDE in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] and historically in [[Scotland]]. Some universities, for instance [[Durham University]] award PGDE on successful completion of 120 University Credit Units (UCU) of a Master of Arts Education course (i.e., completing two years). The PGCE is awarded after 60UCUs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1582">A '''preschool teacher''' is a type of [[early childhood educator]] who instructs children from 2 to age 4, which stands as the youngest stretch of [[early childhood education]].  Early Childhood Education teachers need to span the continuum of children from birth to age 8.

Preschool teachers are encouraged to hold credentials in Early Childhood Education in the form of a Child Development Accreditation (CDA) or formal college education in Early Childhood or a related subject.

The term "preschool" refers to instruction in non-public arenas such as licensed [[preschool]]s, [[childcare]] centers, [[family day care]] centers, [[home day care]] centers, center-based programs, federal programs like [[Head Start Program|Head Start]], and full or part-day private child centers or day care centers sponsored by religious bodies.  The term "[[pre-kindergarten]]" refers to those lead teachers who offer instruction in a program for four-year-olds funded as part of the state public school system.

Preschool teachers must be able to work well and interact with young children, sometimes as young as 2 years 9 months. Preschool children have a short [[attention span]] and their worries are usually fairly simple. Most preschoolers are loving, affectionate, and playful, and like to play games, be read to, or play with toys.

[[Image:Virtual magnifying glass screenshot.jpg|thumb|Login to Wikipedia using a screen magnifier.]]
A '''screen magnifier''' is software that interfaces with a computer's graphical output to present enlarged screen content. By enlarging part (or all) of a screen, people with visual impairments can better see words and images. This type of [[assistive technology]] is useful for people with some functional vision; people with [[visual impairment|visual impairments]] and little or no functional vision usually use a [[screen reader]]. 

==Use==
The simplest form of magnification presents an enlarged portion of the original screen content, the '''focus''', so that it covers some or all of the full screen. This enlarged portion should include the content of interest to the user and the pointer or cursor, also suitably enlarged. As the user moves the pointer or cursor the screen magnifier should track with it and show the new enlarged portion. If this tracking is jerky or [[flickers]] it is likely to disturb the user. Also, the pointer or cursor may not be the content of interest: for example, if the user presses a [[keyboard shortcut]]s that opens a menu, the magnified portion should jump to that menu. Pop-up windows and changes in system status can also trigger this rapid shifting.

Screen magnifiers can be especially helpful for people suffering from low vision, including elderly users. However, in a 2001 paper, [http://staff.computing.dundee.ac.uk/vlh/ Vicki Hanson] noted that people with low vision often also suffer from additional disabilities such as tremors.&lt;ref&gt;

| access-date    = 2017-02-14
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Ranges of 1- to 16-times magnification are common.  The greater the magnification the smaller the proportion of the original screen content that can be viewed, so users will tend to use the lowest magnification they can manage.

Screen magnifiers commonly provide several other features for people with particular sight difficulties:
* '''Color inversion'''.  Many people with visual impairments prefer to invert the colors, typically turning text from black-on-white to white-on-black. This can reduce screen glare and is useful for elderly people suffering from [[Macular degeneration|age-related macular degeneration]].
* '''Smoothing''' Text can become blocky and harder to recognise when enlarged. Some screen magnifiers use [[interpolation]] to smooth the text to compensate.
* '''Cursor customisation'''.  The mouse and text cursors can often be modified in several ways, such as circling it to help the user locate it on the screen.
* '''Different magnification modes''' Screen magnifiers can alter how they present the enlarged portion: covering the full screen, providing a lens that is moved around the un-magnified screen, or using a fixed magnified portion.
* '''Crosshairs'''.  Even with magnification, some users can find the mouse pointer hard to see. Crosshairs — especially when their size, color and opacity are customizable — can make the use of a pointing device easier.
* '''Screen reader'''.  Some magnifiers come packaged with a basic [[screen reader]], allowing whatever the user is pointing at to be read out.

==Screen magnifiers bundled with an operating system==
* [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]] includes an application called Magnify&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haiku User Guide - Magnify|url=http://www.haiku-os.org/docs/userguide/en/applications/magnify.html | accessdate = 2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** [[KDE]] has KMagnifier (KMag)
* The [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system has included the [[Magnifier (Windows)| "Magnifier"]] application since [[Windows 98]] (released in 1998). It can integrate with a mouse-button toggle.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''senior secondary years''' are the years of later [[adolescence]] corresponding to the later part of [[secondary education]].  Although definitions vary, the senior secondary years are sometimes defined as being from approximately age 15 to age 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1N3XtGTfyfMC&amp;pg=PA125|title=Education for the Student Teacher|first=Pieter Andries |last=Duminy|year=1995|isbn=9780636013148|page=125|publisher=Pearson South Africa|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term generally includes [[eleventh grade]] and [[twelfth grade]], and may sometimes also include [[tenth grade]].&lt;ref name="mfac"/&gt;

The senior secondary years often involve a difficult transition from the world of the child to that of the adult.{{sfn|Duminy|1995|p=125}}  In many countries, school attendance is no longer [[compulsory schooling|compulsory]] in the senior secondary years. 

The term "senior secondary" may also be used to refer to any institution that covers the upper part of secondary education, such as a [[high school]].

==Australia==

In Australian education, the senior secondary years are the last two years of [[secondary education]], years 11 and 12. The [[Senior Secondary Certificate of Education]] (SSCE) is the graduation certificate awarded to most students in Australian high schools. The name and the curriculum of the certificate varies between each state and territory. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Senior Secondary Years 11-12|url=http://www.gpcc.nsw.edu.au/education-k-12/senior-9-12/|publisher=Green Point Christian College|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some institutions have also traditionally included year 10.&lt;ref name="mfac"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mfac.edu.au/learning-life/academic/secondary/senior-secondary-yrs-10-11-12|title=Senior Secondary Academic Program |publisher=Matthew Flinders Anglican College|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Australian Curriculum]] implemented in the early 2010s, the senior secondary years have a separate [[curriculum]] from the curriculum that runs from through year 10.&lt;ref name="auscur"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/|title=Australian Curriculum|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social intelligence''' is the capacity to know oneself and to know others.&lt;ref&gt;''The Man Problem: destructive masculinity in Western culture'', Palgrave Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social scientist]] [[Ross Honeywill]] believes social intelligence is an aggregated measure of self- and social-awareness, evolved social beliefs and attitudes, and a capacity and appetite to manage complex social change.&lt;ref name="jofamericanscience.org"&gt;http://www.jofamericanscience.org/journals/am-sci/am110315/004_28107am110315_23_27.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychologist]], [[Nicholas Humphrey]] believes that it is social intelligence, rather than quantitative intelligence, that defines who we are as humans. 

The original definition by [[Edward Thorndike]] in 1920 is "the ability to understand and manage men and women and boys and girls, to act wisely in human relations".&lt;ref&gt;Thorndike, E.L. (1920). Intelligence and its use. Harper's Magazine, 140, 227–235.,&lt;/ref&gt; It is equivalent to [[interpersonal intelligence]], one of the types of intelligence identified in [[Howard Gardner]]'s [[theory of multiple intelligences]], and closely related to [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ganaie, MY &amp; Mudasir, Hafiz, 'A Study of Social Intelligence &amp; Academic Achievement of College Students of District Srinagar', Journal of American Science 2015; 11(3)&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have restricted the definition to deal only with knowledge of social situations, perhaps more properly called [[social cognition]] or [[social marketing intelligence]], as it pertains to trending socio-psychological advertising and marketing strategies and tactics. According to Sean Foleno, social intelligence is a person’s competence to optimally understand one's environment and react appropriately for socially successful conduct.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It is important to note the multiple definitions listed above, as there is yet to be a complete consensus on the operational definition of social intelligence. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grieve|first=Rachel|last2=Mahar|first2=Doug|date=2013-03-01|title=Can social intelligence be measured? Psychometric properties of the Tromsø Social Intelligence Scale – English Version|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03033910.2012.737758|journal=The Irish Journal of Psychology|volume=34|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.1080/03033910.2012.737758|issn=0303-3910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypothesis==
The social intelligence hypothesis states that social intelligence, that is, complex socialization such as politics, romance, family relationships, quarrels, collaboration, reciprocity, and altruism, (1) was the driving force in developing the size of human brains and (2) today provides our ability to use those large brains in complex social circumstances.&lt;ref name="socialeconomics.com.au"&gt;http://www.socialeconomics.com.au&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis claims that the demands of living together is what drives our need for intelligence. social intelligence is also a evolutionary advancement to deal with highly complex social situations, and maintain power or gain it, control people. 
Archaeologist [[Steve Mithen]] believes that there are two key periods of human brain growth that contextualize the social intelligence hypothesis. The first was about two million years ago, when the brain more than doubled in size. Mithen believes that this growth was because people were living in larger, more complex groups, and had to keep track of more people and relationships. These changes required a greater mental capacity and, in turn, a larger brain size.&lt;ref name="shes"&gt;Steven Mithen Professor in Archaeology, School of Archaeology, Geography and Environmental Science, University of Reading – http://www.reading.ac.uk/archaeology/about/staff/s-j-mithen.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The second key growth period in human brain size occurred between 600,000 and 200,000 years ago, when the brain reached its modern size. This growth is still not fully explained. Mithen’s believes that it is related to the evolution of language. Language may be the most complex cognitive task we undertake. It is directly related to social intelligence because we mainly use language to mediate our social relationships.&lt;ref name="shes" /&gt;

Social intelligence was a critical factor in brain growth. Social and cognitive complexity co-evolve.&lt;ref&gt;Benoit Hardy-Vallée, ''The Philosophy of Social Cognition''. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
The social intelligence quotient (SQ) is a statistical abstraction, similar to the ‘standard score’ approach used in [[IQ tests]], with a mean of 100.   Scores of 140 or above are considered to be very high. Unlike the standard IQ test, it is not a fixed model.&lt;ref name="socialintelligencelab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialintelligencelab.com|title=Social Intelligence Lab|date=|publisher=Social Intelligence Lab|accessdate=2012-09-29}}{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2013}}&lt;!--present source is a blog that uses terms in a sloppy way, for instance "quantitative intelligence" - without definition of what that is supposed to be.--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; It leans more to [[Jean Piaget]]’s theory that intelligence is not a fixed attribute, but a complex hierarchy of information-processing skills underlying an adaptive equilibrium between the individual and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/piaget.htm |title=Piaget's developmental theory |publisher=Learningandteaching.info |date=2010-02-10 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, an individual can change their SQ by altering their attitudes and behaviour in response to their complex social environment.&lt;ref name="socialintelligencelab" /&gt;

SQ has until recently been measured by techniques such as question and answer sessions. These sessions assess the person's [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] abilities to test eligibility in certain special education courses; however, some tests have been developed to measure social intelligence. This test can be used when diagnosing [[autism spectrum disorder]]s, including [[autism]] and [[Asperger syndrome]]. This test can also be used to check for some non-autistic or semi-autistic conditions such as [[semantic pragmatic disorder]] or SPD, [[schizophrenia]], [[dyssemia]] and [[ADHD]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some social intelligence measures exist which are self-report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Can social intelligence be measured? Psychometric properties of the Tromsø Social Intelligence Scale – English Version|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03033910.2012.737758|journal = The Irish Journal of Psychology|date = 2013-03-01|issn = 0303-3910|pages = 1–12|volume = 34|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/03033910.2012.737758|first = Rachel|last = Grieve|first2 = Doug|last2 = Mahar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although easy to administer, there is some question as to whether self-report social intelligence measures would better be interpreted in terms of social self-efficacy (that is, one's confidence in one's ability to deal with social information).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Development and validation of a measure of cognitive and behavioural social self-efficacy|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886913013664|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|date = 2014-03-01|pages = 71–76|volume = 59|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2013.11.008|first = Rachel|last = Grieve|first2 = Kate|last2 = Witteveen|first3 = G. Anne|last3 = Tolan|first4 = Brett|last4 = Jacobson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with low SQ are more suited to work with low customer contact, as well as in smaller groups or teams, or independently,  because they may not have the required interpersonal communication and social skills for success on with customers and other co-workers.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2011}} People with SQs over 120 are considered socially skilled, and may work exceptionally well with jobs that involve direct contact and communication with other people.&lt;ref name="socialeconomics.com.au"/&gt;

'''George Washington University Social Intelligence Test''' : Is one of the only ability measure available for assessing social intelligence and was created in June 1928 by Dr.Thelma Hunt a psychologist from George Washington University.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = THE MEASUREMENT OF SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE|url = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/24560179/measurement-social-intelligence|website = connection.ebscohost.com|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally proposed as a measurement of a person's capacity to deal with people and social relationships.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = George Washington University Social Intelligence Test – Revised Form, 2nd Edition (GWSIT) {{!}} Psychology Resource Centre – Hebblab|url = http://psycentre.apps01.yorku.ca/drpl/commercial-test/george-washington-university-social-intelligence-test-revised-form-2nd-edition-gwsit|website = psycentre.apps01.yorku.ca|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test is designed to assess various social abilities which consisted of observing human behavior, social situation judgement, name &amp; face memory and [[theory of mind]] from facial expressions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The George Washington University Social Intelligence Test revised second edition consists of items as quoted:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Observation of human behavior&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Recognition of the mental state of the speaker&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Memory for names &amp; faces&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Judgement in social situations&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Sense of humor&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Differences from intelligence==
Nicholas Humphrey points to a difference between intelligence being measured by [[IQ test]]s and social intelligence. Some autistic children are extremely intelligent because they have well developed skills of observing and memorizing information, however they have low social intelligence. Similarly, chimpanzees are very adept at observation and memorization, but according to Humphrey, inept at handling interpersonal relationships. What they lack is a theory of others' minds. For a long time, the field was dominated by [[behaviorism]], that is, the theory that one could understand animals including humans, just by observing their behavior and finding [[correlation]]s. But recent theories indicate that one must consider the inner structure behavior.&lt;ref name="Honeywill 2015"&gt;Honeywill, Ross 2015, Social intelligence is also being able to make important social decisions which can change your life
 ''The Man Problem: destructive masculinity in Western culture'', Palgrave Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Nicholas Humphrey]] and [[Ross Honeywill]] believe that it is social intelligence, or the richness of our qualitative life, rather than our quantitative intelligence, that makes humans what they are. For example, what it is like to be a human being living at the centre of the conscious present, surrounded by smells, tastes, feels and the sense of being an extraordinary metaphysical entity with properties which hardly seem to belong to the physical world. This is social intelligence.&lt;ref name="jofamericanscience.org"/&gt;

==Additional views==
Social intelligence is closely related to [[cognition]] and [[emotional intelligence]].{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2011}}
Research psychologists studying social cognition and social [[neuroscience]] have discovered many principles in which human social intelligence operates. In early work on this topic, psychologists [[Nancy Cantor]] and [[John Kihlstrom]] outlined the kinds of concepts people use to make sense of their social relations (e.g., “What situation am I in?, What kind of person is this?, Who is talking to me?”), the rules they use to draw inferences (“What did he mean by that?”) and plan actions (“What am I going to do about it?”).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Social Intelligence|url = http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~kihlstrm/social_intelligence.htm|website = ist-socrates.berkeley.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sameer M Babu is a professor who wrote an article about classroom climate and social intelligence. Babu defines social intelligence as, "the ability to deal efficiently and thoughtfully, keeping one’s own identity, employing apposite social inputs with a wider understanding of social environment; considering empathetic co-operation as a base of social acquaintance."&lt;ref&gt;Babu M, Sameer. (2013). Social Intelligence and Aggressive Behaviour in relation to Classroom Climate in relation to Classroom Climate among Upper Primary School Students of Delhi and Kerala. Unpublished Ph D Thesis. Faculty of Education, Jamia Millia Islamia, India&lt;/ref&gt; 

More recently, popular science writer [[Daniel Goleman]] has drawn on [[social neuroscience]] research to propose that social intelligence is made up of social awareness (including [[empathy]], attunement, [[empathic accuracy]], and [[social cognition]]) and social facility (including synchrony, [[self-presentation]], [[Social influence|influence]], and concern).&lt;ref name="Goleman2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goleman|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Goleman|title=Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships|publisher=Bantam Books|year=2006|isbn=0-553-80352-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Goleman’s research indicates that our social relationships have a direct effect on our physical health, and the deeper the relationship the deeper the impact.  Effects include blood flow, breathing, mood such as fatigue and depression, and weakening of the immune system.&lt;ref name="Goleman2006" /&gt;

Educational researcher Raymond H. Hartjen asserts that expanded opportunities for social interaction enhances intelligence.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2011}} This suggests that children require continuous opportunities for interpersonal experiences in order to develop a keen 'inter-personal psychology'.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2011}} Traditional classrooms do not permit the interaction of complex social behavior. Instead, students in traditional settings are treated as learners who must be infused with more and more complex forms of information. The structure of schools today allows very few of these skills, critical for survival in the world, to develop. Because we so limit the development of the skills of "natural psychologist" in traditional schools, graduates enter the job market handicapped to the point of being incapable of surviving on their own.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2011}} In contrast, students who have had an opportunity to develop their skills in multi-age classrooms and at democratic settings rise above their less socially skilled peers. They have a good sense of self, know what they want in life and have the skills to begin their quest.&lt;ref&gt;Hartjen H., Raymond. [http://www.educationfutures.org/Social_IQ.htm The Preeminent Intelligence – Social IQ]. Retrieved March 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue here is psychology versus social intelligence—as a separate and distinct perspective, seldom articulated.{{clarify|date=August 2013}} An appropriate introduction contains certain hypothetical assumptions about social structure and function, as it relates to intelligence defined and expressed by groups, constrained by cultural expectations that assert potential realities, but make no claims that there is an "exterior" social truth to be defined. This perspective pursues the view that social structures can be defined with the warning that what is mapped into the structure and how that information is stored, retrieved, and decided upon are variable, but can be contained in an abstract and formal grammar—a sort of game of definitions and rules that permit and project an evolving intelligence. Two halves of the coin: one half psychology; the other half social. Unfortunately, most references to social intelligence relate to an individual's social skills. Not mentioned, and more important, is how social intelligence (speaking of a group or assembly of groups) processes information about the world and shares it with participants in the group(s). Are there social structures or can they be designed to accumulate and reveal information to the individual or to other groups. The bigger question is how groups and societies map the environment (ecological, social and personal) into a social structure. How is that structure able to contain a worldview and to reveal that view to the participants? How are decisions made?

===Math Learning Games===
Sokikom's online math games are rooted in the nationally recognized standards of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Curriculum Focal Points for Grades PreK-8&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nctm.org/standards/content.aspx?id=270|title=NCTM Curriculum Focal Points for Grades PreK-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and align to the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core Standards]] for grades k-5. Sokikom is designed as an [[adaptive learning]] experience: students progress through math content at their own pace based on performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQuFBGjITLs|title=Video: Getting Students Started in Sokikom Learning Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learning games can be played alone in single player mode, or online in social, multiplayer games.
*Fractions – A [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] learning game
*Measurement &amp; Data – A game of money, measurements, time, patterns and early [[Algebra]]
*Operations – A numeric operations and early Algebra game
*Geometry – A game of shapes and Geometry

===Classroom Management===
Sokikom's classroom management system allows teachers to reinforce positive behaviors in the classroom. Using a computer, tablet, or mobile device, teachers can award "Class Cash" to students individual virtual accounts. Students can then use these rewards in an online store to purchase items for their character/avatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7PuKtut5lU|title=The Sokikom Story|publisher=Sokikom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards &amp; Reviews==
Sokikom has won multiple awards for its math games and its business successes. Sokikom received a 2011 BESSIE Award from ComputED Gazette, recognizing Sokikom's multiplayer math games in the category Best for Early Elementary Students.&lt;ref name="17th annual BESSIE Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://computedgazette.com/page3.html|title=17th BESSIE Awards|publisher=ComputED Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Spens Report''' was an important 1938 British government report on secondary schools in the UK that lead to much-wider expansion of [[grammar school]]s in the UK, and the introduction of [[Secondary Technical School|technical school]]s and ''modern'' schools. From this report, all people would go to a secondary school. 

==History==
The full title of the report was ''Secondary Education with special reference to Grammar Schools and Technical High Schools''. The report was produced by Sir [[Will Spens]] CBE, the Master from 1927-52 of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]]. 

At the time of the report, around 5% of the British secondary school population would go to university, but 50% of those at [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] attended university. 

===Committees===
The Spens Committee was given its task in the autumn of 1933. It sat for 76 days and examined 150 witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3120044 [[British Journal of Educational Studies]] February 1977]&lt;/ref&gt; Sub-committees sat for another 36 days. Sub-committees were set up to look into the grammar school curriculum in MJarch 1935, and a drafting committee in February 1936. A Code Committee looked at the 1926 [[Hadow Report]] of Sir [[William Henry Hadow]] CBE, and how work from that would report would be included into the Spens Report. What was discussed in each committee, which would have a significant effect on British secondary education, and the committee's findings was dependent on the type of people, and their backgrounds, on each committee and who had appointed them. 

==Content==
It was published on Friday 30 December 1938 by the Consultative Committee of the [[Board of Education (United Kingdom)|Board of Education]]. It concluded that ''the existing arrangements for the whole-time education of boys and girls in England and Wales have ceased to correspond with the actual structure of modern society and with the economic facts of the situation''. 

The report was long and covered many areas, not just the implementation of grammar schools and technical schools.
* It advocated the raising of the school age to 16, when financially possible. This would not happen until September 1972. The [[1936 Education Act]] had raised the [[School-leaving age|leaving age]] ([[Raising of school leaving age in England and Wales|RSLA]] or ROSLA) to 15 from 1 September 1939, but this had been postponed. The 1964 Labour government planned to raise it to 16, but was prevented for economic reasons in 1968. When it was introduced in the early 1970s, the [[NASUWT|National Association of Schoolmasters]] forecast increased [[truancy]], hooliganism and classroom revolt and opposed its introduction. 
* The envisaged diverse secondary education system should connote parity of conditions between the three types of school - modern, technical and grammar.
* School fees should be abolished

==Effect==
The most well known, although not immediate, effect of the report was the [[Education Act 1944]], known as the ''Butler Act'' of [[Rab Butler]] (Lord Butler of [[Saffron Walden]]). This largely implemented main portions of the Spens Report. The 1943 [[Norwood Report]] of Sir [[Cyril Norwood]] was the main contributor to the 1944 Education Act, advocating grammar, technical and secondary modern schools.

'''''The Death and Life of Great American Cities''''' is a 1961 book by writer and activist [[Jane Jacobs]]. The book is a critique of 1950s [[urban planning]] policy, which it holds responsible for the [[urban decay|decline]] of many city [[neighborhoods]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/146/janejacobslegacy.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928205849/http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/146/janejacobslegacy.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-28 |title=Jane Jacobs' Radical Legacy |work=Peter Dreier |date=Summer 2006 |accessdate=3 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Going against the modernist planning dogma of the era, it proposes a newfound appreciation for organic urban vibrancy in the United States.

==Contents==
Reserving her most vitriolic criticism for the "[[Rationalism (architecture)|rationalist]]" planners (specifically [[Robert Moses]]) of the 1950s and 1960s, Jacobs argued that modernist urban planning rejects the city, because it rejects human beings living in a community characterized by layered complexity and seeming chaos. The modernist planners used [[deductive reasoning]] to find principles by which to plan cities. Among these policies she considered [[urban renewal]] the most violent, and [[zoning|separation of uses]] (i.e., [[Residential area|residential]], industrial, commercial) the most prevalent. These policies, she claimed, destroy communities and innovative economies by creating isolated, unnatural urban spaces.

In their place Jacobs advocated "four generators of diversity" that "create effective economic pools of use":&lt;ref&gt;p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mixed use development|Mixed primary uses]], activating streets at different times of the day
* Short blocks, allowing high pedestrian [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)|permeability]]
* Buildings of various ages and states of repair
* [[Urban density|Density]] 
Her aesthetic can be considered opposite to that of the [[Modern architecture|modernists]], upholding redundancy and vibrancy against order and efficiency. She frequently cites [[New York City]]'s [[Greenwich Village]] as an example of a vibrant urban community. The Village, like many similar communities, may well have been preserved, at least in part, by her writing and [[activism]]. The book also played a major role in slowing the rampant redevelopment of [[Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]], where Jacobs was involved in the campaign to stop the [[Spadina Expressway]].&lt;ref&gt;Cervero, Robert (1998). ''The Transit Metropolis: A Global Inquiry'', p. 87. Island Press. {{ISBN|1-55963-591-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Jacobs begins the work with blunt pugilism: "This book is an attack on current city planning and rebuilding." She describes a trip to Boston's [[North End, Boston|North End]] neighborhood in 1959, finding it friendly, safe, and healthy, and contrasting her experience against her conversations with elite planners and financiers in the area, who lament it as a "terrible slum" in need of renewal. Branding the mainstream theory of cities as an "elaborately learned superstition" that had now penetrated the thinking of planners, bureaucrats, and bankers in equal measure, she briefly traces the origins of this "orthodox urbanism."

===Description of orthodox urbanism===
In summarizing the development of contemporary city planning theory, she begins with the [[Garden city movement|Garden City]] of [[Ebenezer Howard]]. The Garden City was conceived as a new master-planned form, a self-sufficient town removed from the noise and squalor of late 19th century London, ringed by agriculture green belts, with schools and housing surrounding a highly prescribed commercial center. The Garden City would allow a maximum of 30,000 residents in each town, and called for a permanent public authority to carefully regulate land use and ward off the temptation to increase commercial activity or population density. Industrial factories were allowed on the periphery, provided they were masked behind green spaces. The Garden City concept was first embodied in the UK by the development of [[Letchworth]] and [[Welwyn Garden City]], and in the US suburb of [[Radburn, NJ]].

Jacobs tracks Howard's influence through American luminaries Lewis Mumford, Clarence Stein, Henry Wright, and Catherine Bauer, a collection of thinkers that Bauer referred to as "Decentrists." The Decentrists proposed to use [[regional planning]] as a means to ameliorate the woes of congested cities, attracting residents to a new life in lower-density fringes and suburbs and thereby thinning out the crowded urban core. Jacobs highlights the anti-urban biases of the Garden City advocates and the Decentrists, especially their shared intuitions that communities should be self-contained units; that commingled land use created a chaotic, unpredictable, and negative environment; that the street was a bad locus for human interactions; that houses should be turned away from the street toward sheltered green spaces; that super-blocks fed by arterial roads were superior to small blocks with overlapping cross-roads; that any significant details should be dictated by permanent plan rather than shaped by organic dynamism; and that population density should be discouraged, or at least disguised to create a sense of isolation.

Jacobs' continues her survey of orthodox urbanism with [[Le Corbusier]], whose [[Ville Radieuse|Radiant City]] concept envisioned twenty-four towering skyscrapers within a Great Park. Superficially at odds with the low-rise, low-density ideals of the Decentrists, Le Corbusier presented his vertical city, with its 1,200 inhabitants per acre, as a way of extending the primary Garden City concepts – the super-block, regimented neighborhood planning, easy automobile access, and the insertion of large grassy expanses to keep pedestrians off the streets – into the city itself, with the explicit goal of reinventing stagnant downtowns. Jacobs concludes her introduction with a reference to the [[City Beautiful]] movement, which dotted downtown areas with civic centers, baroque boulevards, and new monument parks. These efforts borrowed concepts from other contexts, such as single-use public space disconnected from natural walking routes and the imitation of the exposition grounds at the World's Fair in Chicago.

===Sources of orthodox urbanism===
* ''[[Garden Cities of To-morrow]]'', [[Ebenezer Howard]].
* ''The Culture of Cities'' [[Lewis Mumford]].
* ''Cities in Evolution'', [[Sir Patrick Geddes]].
* ''Modern Housing'', [[Catherine Bauer]].
* ''Toward New Towns for America'', [[Clarence Stein]].
* ''Nothing Gained by Overcrowding'', [[Sir Raymond Unwin]].
* ''The City of Tomorrow and Its Planning'', [[Le Corbusier]].

===Criticism of orthodox urbanism===
Jacobs admits that the ideas of the Garden City and the Decentrists made sense on their own terms: a suburban town appealing to privacy-oriented, automobile-loving personalities should tout its green space and low-density housing. Jacobs' anti-orthodox frustration stems from the fact that their anti-urban biases somehow became an inextricable part of the mainstream academic and political consensus on how to design '' cities themselves'', enshrined in course curricula and federal and state legislation affecting, ''inter alia'', housing, mortgage financing, [[urban renewal]], and zoning decisions. "This is the most amazing event in the whole sorry tale: that finally people who sincerely wanted to strengthen great cities should adopt recipes frankly devised for undermining their economies and killing them." She is less sympathetic toward Le Corbusier, noting with dismay that the dream city, however impractical and detached from the actual context of existing cities, "was hailed deliriously by architects, and has gradually been embodied in scores of projects, ranging from low-income public housing to office building projects." She expresses further concern that, in seeking to avoid becoming contaminated by "the workaday city," isolated City Beautiful efforts dismally failed to attract visitors, were prone to unsavory loitering and dispirited decay, and ironically hastened the pace of urban demise.

==The significance of sidewalks==
Jacobs frames the sidewalk as a central mechanism in maintaining the order of the city. "This order is all composed of movement and change, and although it is life, not art, we may fancifully call it the art form of the city and liken it to the dance." To Jacobs, the sidewalk is the quotidian stage for an "intricate ballet in which the individual dancers and ensembles all have distinctive parts which miraculously reinforce each other and compose an orderly whole."

Jacobs posits cities as fundamentally different from towns and suburbs principally because they are full of strangers. More precisely, the ratio of strangers to acquaintances is necessarily lopsided everywhere one goes in the city, even outside their doorstep, "because of the sheer number of people in small geographical compass." A central challenge of the city, therefore, is to make its inhabitants feel safe, secure, and socially integrated in the midst of an overwhelming volume of rotating strangers. The healthy sidewalk is a critical mechanism for achieving these ends, given its role in preventing crime and facilitating contact with others.

Jacobs emphasizes that city sidewalks should be considered in combination with physical environment surrounding sidewalks. As she put it, "A city sidewalk by itself is nothing. It is an abstraction. It means something only in conjunction with the buildings and other uses that border it, or border other sidewalks very near it."

===Safety===
Jacobs argues that city sidewalks and people who use sidewalks actively participate in fighting against disorder and preserving civilization. They are more than "passive beneficiaries of safety or helpless victims of danger". The healthy city sidewalk does not rely on constant police surveillance to keep it safe, but on an "intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards among the people themselves, and enforced by the people themselves." Noting that a well-used street is apt to be relatively safe from crime, while a deserted street is apt to be unsafe, Jacobs suggests that a dense volume of human users deters most violent crimes, or at least ensures a critical mass of first responders to mitigate disorderly incidents. The more bustling a street, the more interesting it is for strangers to walk along or watch from inside, creating an ever larger pool of unwitting deputies who might spot early signs of trouble. In other words, healthy sidewalks transform the city's high volume of strangers from a liability to an asset. The self-enforcing mechanism is especially strong when the streets are supervised by their "natural proprietors," individuals who enjoy watching street activity, feel naturally invested in its unspoken codes of conduct, and are confident that others will support their actions if necessary. They form the first line of defense for administering order on the sidewalk, supplemented by police authority when the situation demands it. She further concludes three necessary qualities that a city street needs to maintain safety: 1) a clear demarcation between public and private space; 2) eyes upon the street and sufficient buildings facing streets; 3) continuous eyes on the street to guarantee effective surveillance. Over time, a considerable number of criminological studies have applied the concept of "[[eyes on the street]]" in crime prevention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paul|first=Cozens,|last2=D.|first2=Hillier,|date=2012|title=Revisiting Jane Jacobs's 'Eyes on the Street' for the Twenty-First Century: Evidence from Environmental Criminology|url=http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11937/46095|journal=The Urban Wisdom of Jane Jacobs|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Jacobs contrasts the natural proprietors to the "birds of passage", the transient and uninvested block dwellers who "have not the remotest idea of who takes care of their street, or how." Jacobs warns that, while neighborhoods can absorb a large number of these individuals, "if and when the neighborhood finally ''becomes'' them, they will gradually find the streets less secure, they will be vaguely mystified about it, and...they will drift away." 

Jacobs draws a parallel between empty streets and the deserted corridors, elevators, and stairwells in high-rise public housing projects. These "blind-eyed" spaces, modeled after the upper-class standards for apartment living but lacking the amenities of access control, doormen, elevator men, engaged building management, or related supervisory functions, are ill-equipped to handle strangers, and therefore the presence of strangers becomes "an automatic menace." They are open to the public but shielded from public view, and thus "lack the checks and inhibitions exerted by eye-policed city streets," becoming flash points for destructive and malicious behavior. As residents feel progressively unsafe outside their apartments, they increasingly disengage from the life of the building and exhibit tendencies of birds of passage. These troubles are not irreversible. Jacobs claims that a Brooklyn project successfully reduced vandalism and theft by opening the corridors to public view, equipping them as play spaces and narrow porches, and even letting tenants use them as picnic grounds.

Building on the idea that a bustling pedestrian environment is a prerequisite for city safety in the absence of a contracted surveillance force, Jacobs recommends a substantial quantity of stores, bars, restaurants, and other public places "sprinkled along the sidewalks" as a means to this end. She argues that if city planners persist in ignoring sidewalk life, residents will resort to three coping mechanisms as the streets turn deserted and unsafe: 1) move out of the neighborhood, allowing the danger to persist for those too poor to move anywhere else, 2) retreat to the automobile, interacting with the city only as a motorist and never on foot, or 3) cultivate a sense of neighborhood "Turf", cordoning off upscale developments from unsavory surroundings using cyclone fences and patrolmen.

===Contact===
Sidewalk life permits a range of casual public interactions, from asking for directions and getting advice from the grocer, to nodding hello to passersby and admiring a new dog. "Most of it is ostensibly trivial but the sum is not trivial at all." The sum is "a web of public respect and trust," the essence of which is that it "''implies no private commitments''" and protects precious privacy. In other words, city dwellers know that they can engage in sidewalk life without fear of "entangling relationships" or oversharing the details of one's personal life. Jacobs contrasts this to areas with no sidewalk life, including low-density suburbia, where residents must either expose a more significant portion of their private lives to a small number of intimate contacts or else settle for a lack of contact altogether. In order to sustain the former, residents must become exceedingly deliberate in choosing their neighbors and their associations. Arrangements of this sort, Jacobs argues, can work well "for self-selected upper-middle-class people," but fails to work for anyone else.

Residents in places with no sidewalk life are conditioned to avoid basic interactions with strangers, especially those of a different income, race, or educational background, to the extent that they cannot imagine having a deep personal relationship with others so unlike themselves. This is a false choice on any bustling sidewalk, where everyone is afforded the same dignity, right of way, and incentive to interact without fear of compromising one's privacy or creating new personal obligations. In this way, suburban residents ironically tend to have ''less'' privacy in their social lives than their urban counterparts, in addition to a dramatically reduced volume of public acquaintances.

===Assimilating children===
Sidewalks are great places for children to play under the general supervision of parents and other natural proprietors of the street. More importantly, sidewalks are where children learn the "first fundamental of successful city life: People must take a modicum of public responsibility for each other even if they have no ties to each other." Over countless minor interactions, children absorb the fact that the sidewalk's natural proprietors are invested in their safety and well-being, even lacking ties of kinship, close friendship, or formal responsibility. This lesson cannot be institutionalized or replicated by hired help, as it is essentially an organic and informal responsibility.

Jacobs states that sidewalks of thirty to thirty-five feet in width are ideal, capable of accommodating any demands for general play, trees to shade the activity, pedestrian circulation, adult public life, and even loitering. However, she admits that such width is a luxury in the era of the automobile, and finds solace that twenty-foot sidewalks – precluding rope jumping but still capable of lively mixed use – can still be found. Even if it lacks proper width, a sidewalk can be a compelling place for children to congregate and develop if the location is convenient and the streets are interesting.

==The role of parks==
Orthodox urbanism defines parks as  "boons conferred on the deprived populations of cities." Jacobs challenges the reader to invert this relationship, and "consider city parks deprived places that need the boon of life and appreciation conferred on ''them''." Parks become lively and successful for the same reason as sidewalks: "because of functional physical diversity among adjacent uses, and hence diversity among users and their schedules." Jacobs offers four tenets of good park design: intricacy (stimulating a variety of uses and repeat users), centering (a main crossroads, pausing point, or climax), access to sunlight, and enclosure (the presence of buildings and a diversity of surroundings).

The fundamental rule of the neighborhood sidewalk also applies to the neighborhood park: "liveliness and variety attract more liveliness; deadness and monotony repel life." Jacobs admits that a well-designed park in a focal point of a lively neighborhood can be an enormous asset. But with so many worthy urban investments going unfunded, Jacobs warns against "frittering away money on parks, playgrounds and project land-oozes too large, too frequent, too perfunctory, too ill-located, and hence too dull or too inconvenient to be used."

==City neighborhoods==
Jacobs bristles at the orthodox conception of a city neighborhood as a modular, insulated grouping of roughly 7,000 residents, the estimated number of persons to populate an elementary school and support a neighborhood market and community center. Jacobs believes this definition provincial and arbitrary; a feature of a great city is the mobility of residents and fluidity of use across diverse areas of varying size and character, not modular fragmentation. Jacobs' alternative is to define neighborhoods at three levels of geographic and political organization: city-level, street-level, and district-level.

The city of New York as a whole is itself a neighborhood, the parent community from which public money flows, administrative and policy decisions are made, and conflicts of general welfare are resolved on behalf of districts. Civic associations and special interest groups – from opera societies to public unions – are often formed at the city level, creating like-minded communities of interest that coordinate local activities. At the opposite end of the scale, individual streets – such as Hudson Street in Greenwich Village – can also be characterized as neighborhoods. Street-level city neighborhoods, as argued elsewhere in the book, should aspire to have a sufficient frequency of commerce, general liveliness, use and interest so as to sustain public street life. They are not discrete units of fixed length, but economic and social continuities of all proximate street-level neighborhoods.

Finally, the district of Greenwich Village is itself neighborhood, with a shared functional identity and common fabric. The primary purpose of the district neighborhood is to intermediate between the needs of the street-level neighborhoods and the resource allocation and policy decisions made at the city-level. Jacobs estimates the maximum effective size of a city district to be 200,000 people and 1.5 square miles, but prefers a functional definition over a spatial definition: "big enough to fight city hall, but not so big that street neighborhoods are unable to draw district attention and to count." District boundaries are fluid and overlapping, but are sometimes defined by physical obstructions such as major roadways and landmarks.

Jacobs recommends four pillars of effective city neighborhood planning:
* To foster lively and interesting streets
* To make the fabric of the streets as continuous a network as possible ''throughout'' a district of potential subcity size and power.
* To use parks, squares, and public buildings as part of the street fabric, intensifying the fabric's complexity and multiple uses rather than segregating different uses
* To foster a functional identity at the district level

Jacobs ultimately defines neighborhood quality as a function of how well it can govern and protect itself over time, employing a combination of residential cooperation, political clout, and financial vitality. "A successful city neighborhood is a place that keeps sufficiently abreast of its problems so it is not destroyed by them. An unsuccessful neighborhood is a place that is overwhelmed by its defects and problems and is progressively more hapless before them."

==Legacy==
The book continues to be Jacobs' most influential, and is still widely read by both planning professionals and the general public.{{Nonspecific|date=December 2012}} It has been translated into six languages and has sold over a quarter-million copies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jane-jacobs-480896.html Ward, Stephen: ''Jane Jacobs: Critic of the modernist approach to urban planning who believed that cities were places for people''] in The Independent, 3 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Urban theorist [[Lewis Mumford]], while finding fault with her methodology, encouraged Jacobs' early writings in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Jacobs Interviewed by Jim Kunstler for Metropolis Magazine, March 2001|url=http://www.kunstler.com/mags_jacobs.htm|accessdate=2006-04-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426212456/http://www.kunstler.com/mags_jacobs.htm|archivedate=2006-04-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Caro]] has cited Jacobs' book as the strongest influence on ''[[The Power Broker]]'', his biography of [[Robert Moses]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} [[Samuel R.

The '''Toyota Technology Challenge''' is an environmentally friendly [[engineering]] and [[technology]] competition for young people in the [[United Kingdom]]. The competition has been developed by [[Toyota Manufacturing UK]] in partnership with [[Rapid Electronics]].

== Competition being updated for 2012-2013==

The TTC has been running for over 10 years now (May 2012).  Toyota Motor Manufacturing (UK) Ltd are looking into improvements that will make it easier for schools to compete against each other and reduce the workload on schools entering.  From 1 May 2012 to 1 June 2012, a short survey is available at http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/C6HK2SW to gauge opinions of the TTC and also other educational 'car' based competitions.  This survey will help shape the TTC competition in future years.

== Purpose ==

The challenge is targeted at pupils in [[Science]] and [[Technology]] at Key Stages 3 and 4 (aged 11–16) of the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. Teams of three to five pupils are asked to [[design]] and build an [[environmentally friendly]] model vehicle using either [[solar power]] or [[PIC microcontroller]] technology. The competition offers students the chance to put their [[electronics]] and [[engineering]] skills into practice. Pupils are encouraged to consider the [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]] of their creations and the potential use of recycled materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapidonline.com/toyota/default.htm Toyota Technology Challenge website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217115017/http://www.rapidonline.com/toyota/default.htm |date=2008-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenge stages ==

The challenge consists of three stages: the submission of a project folder, Regional Finals and the National Final.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapidonline.com/toyota/stages.htm Toyota Technology Challenge stages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217055017/http://www.rapidonline.com/toyota/stages.htm |date=2008-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once registered into the competition, schools receive a free kit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapidonline.com/toyota/contents.htm Toyota Technology Challenge kit contents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217055220/http://www.rapidonline.com/toyota/contents.htm |date=2008-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; containing all the [[electronic components]] necessary to build a vehicle. Teams can earn extra marks by making their vehicle more environmentally friendly, improving its performance and creating a team identity.

The winners of the Regional Finals win £250 for their schools and qualify for the National Final, which takes place at the manufacturing plant of [[Toyota Manufacturing UK]] at Burnaston, Derbyshire. The winners of the National Final receive £750 for their schools and a European holiday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapidonline.com/toyota/prizes.htm Toyota Technology Challenge prizes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217115040/http://www.rapidonline.com/toyota/prizes.htm |date=2008-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria ==

Contestants in the [[solar power]] category must create a vehicle which illustrates the idea of a car of the future, capable of harnessing solar energy, storing it and releasing it under controlled conditions. The vehicle must include [[recycled]] or recyclable components or materials within its design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapidonline.com/toyota/solar.htm Solar power design criteria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217112430/http://www.rapidonline.com/toyota/solar.htm |date=2008-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[PIC microcontroller]] teams design and build a program-controlled environmentally friendly model vehicle, using a PIC microcontroller to provide in-built intelligence so that it can automatically avoid obstacles on a track. The vehicle must include recycled or recyclable components within its design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapidonline.com/toyota/pic.htm PIC design criteria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217055231/http://www.rapidonline.com/toyota/pic.htm |date=2008-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Winners ==
The 2010 winners were:
* Solar Category - ACCTAW Mach II from Test Valley School, Hampshire
* PIC Category - Vetronics from Beechwood Park School, Hertfordshire

'''Trial and error''' is a fundamental method of [[problem solving]].&lt;ref&gt;Evolutionary Epistemology, Rationality, and the Sociology of Knowledge p94 p108&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterised by repeated, varied attempts which are continued until success,&lt;ref&gt;Concise Oxford Dictionary p1489&lt;/ref&gt; or until the agent stops trying.

According to [[W.H. Thorpe]], the term was [[neologism|devised]] by [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] (1852–1936) after trying out similar phrases "trial and failure" and "trial and practice".&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe W.H. The origins and rise of ethology. Hutchinson, London &amp; Praeger, New York. p26. {{ISBN|978-0-03-053251-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Morgan's Canon]], [[ethology|animal behaviour]] should be explained in the simplest possible way. Where behaviour seems to imply higher mental processes, it might be explained by trial-and-error learning. An example is the skillful way in which his terrier Tony opened the garden gate, easily misunderstood as an insightful act by someone seeing the final behaviour. Lloyd Morgan, however, had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response, and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it.

[[Edward Thorndike]] showed how to manage a trial-and-error experiment in the laboratory. In his famous experiment, a cat was placed in a series of puzzle boxes in order to study the [[law of effect]] in learning.&lt;ref&gt;Thorndike E.L. 1898. Animal intelligence: an experimental study of the association processes in animals. ''Psychological Monographs'' #8.&lt;/ref&gt; He plotted learning curves which recorded the timing for each trial. Thorndike's key observation was that learning was promoted by positive results, which was later refined and extended by [[B.F. Skinner]]'s [[operant conditioning]].

Trial and error is also a [[heuristic]] method of problem solving, [[repair]], tuning, or obtaining [[knowledge]]. In the field of [[computer science]], the method is called '''generate and test'''. In elementary algebra, when solving equations, it is '''"guess and check"'''.

This approach can be seen as one of the two basic approaches to problem solving, contrasted with an approach using [[insight]] and [[theory]]. However, there are intermediate methods which for example, use theory to guide the method, an approach known as ''guided empiricism''.

==Methodology==
This approach is far more successful with simple problems and in games, and is often resorted to when no apparent rule applies. This does not mean that the approach need be careless, for an individual can be methodical in manipulating the variables in an attempt to sort through possibilities that may result in success. Nevertheless, this method is often used by people who have little knowledge in the problem area. The trial-and-error approach has been studied from its natural computational point of view &lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.1183v2 X. Bei, N. Chen, S. Zhang, On the Complexity of Trial and Error, STOC 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simplest applications===
[[William Ross Ashby|Ashby]] (1960, section 11/5) offers three simple strategies for dealing with the same basic exercise-problem; and they have very different efficiencies:
Suppose there are 1000 on/off switches which have to be set to a particular combination by random-based testing, each test to take one second. [This is also discussed in Traill (1978/2006, section C1.2]. The strategies are:
*the perfectionist all-or-nothing method, with no attempt at holding partial successes. This would be expected to take more than 10^301 seconds, [i.e. 2^1000 seconds, or 3·5×(10^291) centuries!];
*a serial-test of switches, holding on to the partial successes (assuming that these are manifest) would take 500 seconds on average; while
*a parallel-but-individual testing of all switches simultaneously would take only one second.

Note the tacit assumption here that no intelligence or insight is brought to bear on the problem. However, the existence of different available strategies allows us to consider a separate ("superior") domain of processing — a ''"meta-level"'' above the mechanics of switch handling — where the various available strategies can be randomly chosen. Once again this is "trial and error", but of a different type. This leads us to:

===Hierarchies===
Ashby's book develops this "meta-level" idea, and extends it into a whole [[recursion|recursive]] sequence of levels, successively above each other in a systematic hierarchy. On this basis he argues that human intelligence emerges from such organization: relying heavily on trial-and-error (at least initially at each new stage), but emerging with what we would call "intelligence" at the end of it all. Thus presumably the topmost level of the hierarchy (at any stage) will still depend on simple trial-and-error.

Traill (1978/2006) suggests that this Ashby-hierarchy probably coincides with [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s well-known theory of developmental stages. [This work also discusses Ashby's 1000-switch example; see §C1.2]. After all, it is part of Piagetian doctrine that children learn by first ''actively doing'' in a more-or-less random way, and then hopefully learn from the consequences — which all has a certain to Ashby's random "trial-and-error".

===Application===
Traill (2008, ''espec. Table "S" on p.31'') follows [[Niels Kaj Jerne|Jerne]] and [[Karl Popper|Popper]] in seeing this strategy as probably underlying ''all'' knowledge-gathering systems — ''at least in their initial phase''.

Four such systems are identified:
*[[Natural selection]] which "educates" the [[DNA]] of the species,
*The brain of the individual (just discussed);
*The "brain" of society-as-such (including the publicly held body of science); and
*The [[adaptive immune system]].

===Intention===
In the Ashby-and-[[Cybernetics]] tradition, the word "trial" usually implies ''random-or-arbitrary'', without any ''deliberate'' choice.

However amongst non-cyberneticians, "trial" will often imply a deliberate subjective act by some adult human agent; (e.g. in a court-room, or laboratory). So that has sometimes led to confusion.

Of course the situation becomes even more confusing if one accepts Ashby's hierarchical explanation of intelligence, and its implied ability to be deliberate and to creatively [[design]] — all based ultimately on ''non-deliberate'' actions. The lesson here seems to be that one must simply be careful to clarify the meaning of one's own words, and indeed the words of others. [Incidentally it seems that ''consciousness'' is not an essential ingredient for ''intelligence'' as discussed                  
 
One of the greatest inventor with 1093 patents was Thomas Alva Edison (TAE). One of his most famous sayings was that "Genius was 5% inspiration and 95% perspiration".  Edison and his assistants would tried 500 ways to invent something and when not succeesful, they would try another 500 ways. When an experiment was not successful, he was happy to admit that he now knew the things that did not work. Trial and error was Edison's most successful means of invention. Most today believe Edison did not follow a scientific theory to invent but invented by: Trial And Error (TAE). 

Today, the approach of [[voodoo programming]] is an usage where code is composed with trial and error until something which produces the desired output is found.

==Features==
Trial and error has a number of features:
*solution-oriented: trial and error makes no attempt to discover ''why'' a solution works, merely that it ''is'' a solution.
*problem-specific: trial and error makes no attempt to generalize a solution to other problems.
*non-optimal: trial and error is generally an attempt to find ''a'' solution, not ''all'' solutions, and not the ''best'' solution.
*needs little knowledge: trials and error can proceed where there is little or no knowledge of the subject.

It is possible to use trial and error to find all solutions or the best solution, when a testably finite number of possible solutions exist. To find all solutions, one simply makes a note and continues, rather than ending the process, when a solution is found, until all solutions have been tried. To find the best solution, one finds all solutions by the method just described and then comparatively evaluates them based upon some predefined set of criteria, the existence of which is a condition for the possibility of finding a best solution. (Also, when only one solution can exist, as in assembling a jigsaw puzzle, then any solution found is the only solution and so is necessarily the best.)

==Examples==
Trial and error has traditionally been the main method of finding new drugs, such as [[antibiotics]]. [[Chemist]]s simply try chemicals at random until they find one with the desired effect. In a more sophisticated version, chemists select a narrow range of chemicals it is thought may have some effect using a technique called [[structure-activity relationship]]. (The latter case can be alternatively considered as a changing of the problem rather than of the solution strategy: instead of "What chemical will work well as an antibiotic?" the problem in the sophisticated approach is "Which, if any, of the chemicals in this narrow range will work well as an antibiotic?") The method is used widely in many disciplines, such as [[polymer technology]] to find new polymer types or families.

Trial and error is also commonly seen in player responses to [[Video game|video games]] - when faced with an obstacle or [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]], players often form a number of strategies to surpass the obstacle or defeat the boss, with each strategy being carried out before the player either succeeds or quits the game.  

[[Sports team|Sports teams]] also make use of trial and error to qualify for and/or progress through the [[playoffs]] and win the [[championship]], attempting different strategies, plays, lineups and formations in hopes of defeating each and every opponent along the way to victory.  This is especially crucial in [[Playoff format#Best-of formats|playoff series in which multiple wins are required to advance]], where a team that loses a game will have the opportunity to try new tactics to find a way to win, if they are not eliminated yet.

The [[scientific method]] can be regarded as containing an element of trial and error in its formulation and testing of hypotheses. Also compare [[genetic algorithm]]s, [[simulated annealing]] and [[reinforcement learning]] – all varieties for search which apply the basic idea of trial and error.

[[Evolution|Biological evolution]] can be considered as a form of trial and error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Serwall|title=The roles of mutation, inbreeding, crossbreeding and selection in evolution|journal=Proceedings of the sixth international congress on genetics|date=1932|volume=Number 6|series=Volume 1|page=365|url=http://www.esp.org/books/6th-congress/facsimile/contents/6th-cong-p356-wright.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Random mutations and sexual genetic variations can be viewed as trials and poor reproductive fitness, or lack of improved fitness, as the error. Thus after a long time 'knowledge' of well-adapted genomes accumulates simply by virtue of them being ''able'' to reproduce.

[[Bogosort]], a conceptual sorting algorithm (that is extremely inefficient and impractical), can be viewed as a trial and error approach to sorting a list. However, typical simple examples of bogosort do not track which orders of the list have been tried and may try the same order any number of times, which violates one of the basic principles of trial and error. Trial and error is actually more efficient and practical than bogosort; unlike bogosort, it is guaranteed to halt in finite time on a finite list, and might even be a reasonable way to sort extremely short lists under some conditions.

[[Jumping spider|Jumping spiders]] of the [[genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Portia (spider)|Portia]]'' use trial and error to find new tactics against unfamiliar prey or in unusual situations, and remember the new tactics.&lt;ref name="HarlandJackson2000Cats"&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Truancy''' is any intentional, unjustified, unauthorized, or illegal absence from [[compulsory education]]. It is absence caused by students of their own free will, and usually does not refer to legitimate excused absences, such as ones related to medical conditions. Truancy is usually explicitly defined in the school's handbook of policies and procedures. Some children whose parents claim to [[homeschooling|homeschool]] have also been found truant in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Home-school mom charged with allowing truancy|work="The Southern"|date=25 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms for truancy include '''playing hooky''' (US English), '''skiving off''' (British English), and '''bunking'''. Attending school but not going to class is called '''skipping class'''.

In some schools, truancy may result in not being able to graduate or to receive credit for classes attended, until the time lost to truancy is made up through a combination of [[Detention (academia)|detention]], [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], or [[summer school]].

Truancy is a frequent subject of popular culture. ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' is about the title character's (played by [[Matthew Broderick]]) day of truancy in [[Chicago]] with his girlfriend and best friend. ''[[Truancy (novel)|Truancy]]'' is also the title of a 2008 novel about a student uprising against a dictatorial educational system.

There are experiences that show that thanks to the incorporation of Successful Educational Actions (SEAs) in schools with high absenteeism they have managed to reduce truancy and thus contribute to the improvement of academic success. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00405|title=Reducing absenteeism and early school leaving.

==Slang expressions==
There are a number of expressions in most languages which refer to truancy. In [[South Africa]], the slang used is ''bunking'', ''mulling'', ''skipping'' or ''jippo''. In [[Jamaica]], it is called ''skulling''. In [[Guyana]] ''skulking''. In [[Antigua and Barbuda]], it is called ''skudding''. In [[New Zealand]] and  [[Australia]] truancy is called ''wagging'',  "jigging", ''ditching'', or ''skipping school''. It is called ''bunking (off)'' or ''skiving'' or ''wagging'' in the [[United Kingdom]], ''mitching'', ''twagging'', "skiving" or ''on the knock''. In [[Wales]], ''mitching or'' ''sagging''. In [[Liverpool]], ''bunking'' or ''cutting class'', ''doggin'', ''skiving'', ''playing tickie'' or ''puggin''. In [[Scotland]], ''on the hop'', ''on the bunk'', ''mitching'', ''beaking'', ''skiving'', ''doggin it'' or ''on the beak''. In [[Ireland]], ''mitching'', ''on the hop'', ''dossing'', ''on the duck'' or ''skiving''. In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] expressions include ''hooky'', ''playing hooky'', ''ditching'', ''dipping'', ''jigging'', ''sluffing'', ''skipping'', ''cutting class'', or simply just ''cutting''. In the city of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], the act of truancy is known amongst youths as ''pipping off'', and truant students are described as being ''on the pip''. In [[Trinidad and Tobago]], it is referred to as ''breaking biche''. In [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]], it is referred to as ''fly''. In the state of [[Utah]] a ''sluff'' is a commonly used word referring to a truancy. In [[Pakistan]] and [[India]] it is referred to as ''bunking''. In [[South Korea]], it is called ''ddaeng-ddaeng-i'' (땡땡이 [땡땡이 치다]). In [[Japan]], It is called ''zuruyasumi''. In [[Indonesia]], It is called "bolos" or "cabut".

=== Denmark ===
In [[Denmark]], some welfare benefits{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} can be confiscated for a period if the child does not attend school. However, not all cities use this approach to keep the children in school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dr.dk/Regioner/Kbh/Nyheder/Hovedstadsomraadet/2007/10/25/072056.htm Det virker at inddrage børnechecken] (It works confiscating the child benefit check), by Anette Sørensen, Denmarks Radio, October 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Most cities{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} watch for families who have not returned their children to school after the summer vacation because some groups [[exile]]d their children to their ethnic home countries for [[behavior modification]]. In the city of [[Aarhus]], 155 children had not turned up one week after the school started.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarhus.dk/default.asp?Id=359&amp;LcId=da&amp;AjrDcmntId=3046&amp;AjrThmId=0&amp;AjrThmPg=0 155 elever er ikke mødt op] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107064059/http://www.aarhus.dk/default.asp?Id=359&amp;LcId=da&amp;AjrDcmntId=3046&amp;AjrThmId=0&amp;AjrThmPg=0 |date=2009-01-07 }} (155 children have not started), by Majken Klintø, aarhus.dk, August 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, research among 4,000 students showed that more than every third student had been absent during the last 14 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2009/04/30/043947.htm Børn pjækker mere fra skole], DR News, April 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===
In [[Finland]] truant pupils usually get detention in comprehensive schools. The police are not involved in truancy control but the teachers of the school monitor the school area and sometimes the nearby areas during recess to avoid unauthorized absence. If the pupil is absent for a long period of time the parents may be fined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/%C3%84idille+sakkoja+lasten+oppivelvollisuuden+laiminly%C3%B6misest%C3%A4/1135249315433|title=Äidille sakkoja lasten oppivelvollisuuden laiminlyömisestä - HS.fi - Kotimaa|accessdate=1 February 2011|language=Finnish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923210550/http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/%C3%84idille+sakkoja+lasten+oppivelvollisuuden+laiminly%C3%B6misest%C3%A4/1135249315433|archivedate=23 September 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of fining is to try to force parents to put their children into school. The child will not be escorted to school, but can be taken away from parents if continued.

=== Germany ===
In [[Germany]], the parents of a child absent from school without a legitimate excuse are notified by the school. If the parents refuse to send their child to school or are unable to control their child, local child services or social services officers may request the police to escort the child to school, and in extreme cases may petition a court to partially or completely remove child custody from the parents. Parents may also be fined in cases of refusal.&lt;ref&gt;OLG Hamm, Beschluss vom 21. Dezember 2012, Az.: II-2 UF 181/11&lt;/ref&gt;

=== England and Wales ===
In [[England and Wales]], truancy is a criminal offence for parents if the child concerned is registered at school&lt;ref&gt;S.7 Education act 1996&lt;/ref&gt;. Truancy laws do not apply to children educated at home or otherwise under Section 7 of the Act. Since the passage of the [[Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000]], parents of persistent truants may be imprisoned for up to three months.&lt;ref&gt;[[Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000]], §72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TruancyTimeline"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7851787.stm|title=Truancy timeline: 1997-2009|publisher=BBC News|date=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the first parent was imprisoned under this provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7880936.stm|title=Jailing parents: What happened next?|date=12 February 2009|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/3561655.stm|title=Truancy mother sent to jail again|publisher=BBC Newsdate|date=23 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998, a police officer of or above the rank of superintendent may direct that for a specified time in a specified area a police officer may remove a child believed to be absent from a school without authority to that school or to another designated place. However this is not a power of arrest and it is not a power to detain, and does not make truancy a criminal offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ERORecords/HO/421/2/cdact/truancy.htm |title=Electronic Records Online |publisher=Nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a warning given the first time the parents allow the child to commit truancy, but if they allow it more than once, then the parents are given a fine starting from £50. Some charities have highlighted an increasing prevalence of truancy among impoverished girls during [[menstruation]], especially among girls who do not have easy access to sanitary products.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/17/girls-from-poorer-families-in-england-struggle-to-afford-sanitary-protection&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], truancy regulations are generally enforced by school officials under the context of parental responsibility. New automated calling systems allow the automated notification of parents when a child is not marked present in the computer, and truancy records for many states are available for inspection online.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} In large schools where law enforcement officers are present, the fine for "playing hooky" can range from $250 to as much as $500. About 12,000 students were ticketed for truancy in 2008 in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/opinion/09ehrenreich.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all|title=OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR; Is It Now a Crime to Be Poor?|last=Ehrenreich|first=Barbara|date=9 August 2009|work=The New York Times|page=9|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many states{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} provide for the appointment of local truancy officers who have the authority to arrest habitually truant youths and bring them to their parents or to the school they are supposed to attend. Many states{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} also have the power to revoke a student's driver's license or permit. Where it exists, a school truancy officer is often a [[constable]] or [[sheriff]], concurrently. The position of a full-time truancy officer is generally viewed{{Weasel-inline|date=February 2011}} as being a relic from the 19th century when mandatory school attendance was relatively new.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Children are required by law to attend school until they reach a certain age, which varies by state (typically 16-18 years), unless an absence is formally excused by a school official or the child has been expelled.

Children in [[private school]] or [[homeschooling]] are exempt from attending mandatory public schooling.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hslda.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Truant's Day==
In [[Poland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], the first day of spring (March 21) is an unofficial occasion popular among children, who traditionally play truant on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.staypoland.com/poland-holidays.htm |title=Public Holidays in Poland |publisher=Staypoland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, students in the [[United States]] have [[Senior Skip Day]]. The date for skip day varies among different schools. In the [[Eastern United States]], Senior Skip Day is often celebrated on the last Friday before Spring Break, or in some cases, the Monday after prom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dyer |first=Elisabeth |title=Life's a beach for many students on senior skip day |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/04/14/Citytimes/Life_s_a_beach_for_ma.shtml |accessdate=23 November 2010 |newspaper=St. Petersburg times |date=14 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of the Andes Library Services''', officially known as '''SERBIULA''' (from the acronym in Spanish for ''Servicios Bibliotecarios de la Universidad de Los Andes''), is the organization responsible for managing and directing all the different libraries of its parent institution, the [[University of the Andes, Venezuela|University of the Andes]], one of the main  universities in [[Venezuela]].

The University of the Andes is not located in a single central campus, but in rather smaller campuses and branches; most of which are scattered across the [[Andes|andean]] and singularly university city of [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]], while the others are located in different states of the country, with their respective library alongside.

== History ==

===Coming to life===
Back in 1785,&lt;ref name="19th-c-History"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://saber.ula.ve/cgi-win/be_alex.exe?Documento=T016300002212/13&amp;term_termino_2=e:/alexandr/db/ssaber/Edocs/pubelectronicas/procesoshistoricos/vol4num8/catedra1-8.pdf |title=Vicissitudes of a provincial University: The University of Los Andes of Mérida. 19th Century | publisher=Samudio A. 2005, p.1. - Abstract|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop Juan Ramos de Lora, a Franciscan clergyman from [[Seville]], opened a [[Seminary|Catholic seminary]] in Mérida, a remote village in the [[Andes|Andes mountains]] of what is now Venezuela, under [[Spanish empire|Spanish rule]] &lt;ref&gt;University of the Andes [http://saber.ula.ve/cgi-win/be_alex.exe?Documento=T016300002597/7&amp;term_termino_2=e:/alexandr/db/ssaber/Edocs/pubelectronicas/procesoshistoricos/vol5num9/catedra1.pdf Financial difficulties in the foundation of the Seminary College San Buenaventura and the creation of the University of Merida, 1785–1810.] Ramírez Méndez 2006, p.1. - Abstract {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; by then. Once the seminary opened, he gathered and collected many books for its library. It was initially composed of some salvaged antique books which dated back centuries, as far as the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Conquista]] times. It also included many ''oeuvres'' from his personal collection and some more from the collaborations and donations of priest friends, ministers and other prominent figures from his [[Historical episcopate|episcopate]]. Hence, the library’s first books were comprehensive in canon law, civil law, medicine, philosophy and literature. Regarding the seminary, just a few years after it was founded, local authorities started lobbying to seek the grant of the [[Bourbon Spain|Spanish government]] to establish it as a [[university]]. The [[university charter]] was granted in 1806, but due to the bellicose period in the region it was only validated in 1810&lt;ref name="19th-c-History"/&gt; thus the seminary became known as the ''Real Universidad de San Buenaventura de Mérida'' (Saint Bonaventure Royal University of Mérida), short before the [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence]]. The library slowly but steadily followed the evolution of its sheltering University.

===Establishment of the University Library===
Most of Venezuela's 19th century was a troublesome period. It was characterized by political turmoil, autocratic rule and consistent ''[[coup d'état|coups d'état]]'' which more often than not hindered the evolution of the academia in the country.&lt;ref name="19th-c-History"/&gt; Nevertheless, in the last decades of the century a steady political stability became foreseeable.  In 1883 the Venezuelan government decided to review the law on the ''higher and scientific national education'', in which the country's two existing universities at the time were renamed with their contemporary name; i.e. ''Universidad de Los Andes'' for the [[University of the Andes, Venezuela|University of the Andes]], and ''Universidad Central de Venezuela'' for the [[Central University of Venezuela]] in Caracas.

With the change of name and policies came a wave of institutional revampment. So, on August 1, 1888&lt;ref name="CPO"&gt;''"[...] en favor del desarrollo de la investigación científica, fue la creación de la Biblioteca de la Universidad, el 1 de agosto de 1888".'' {{cite web | url=http://saber.ula.ve/cgi-win/be_alex.exe?Documento=T016300000574/14&amp;term_termino_2=e:/alexandr/db/ssaber/Edocs/pubelectronicas/investigacion/inum6/articulo6-8.pdf |title=Los orígenes de la investigación científica en la Universidad de Los Andes | publisher=López Bohórquez, 2002, p.2. |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; the then [[Chancellor]] of the University, Dr. Caracciolo Parra, issued a decree ordaining the following:
*The creation of the '''[[Academic library|University Library]]''' embedding a scheme of systematized organization. This of course included shelving the whole of the 1,436 antique books acquired since the inception of the Seminary.
*The housing of the Library in a building suitable to all of its requirements.
*The appointment of Dr. Juan Nepumoceno Monsant as interim Chief Librarian.
*The due repair of all damaged and decaying books.
*The mandatory donation to the Library of one renowned and useful publication by every former student of the University.

The University Library was at last inaugurated on October 27, 1889. By the end of 1894 the Library was counting 1,436 titles and 1,725 volumes. By the turn of the 20th century these figures had bloomed to 2,120 and 2,572 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saber.ula.ve/db/ssaber/Edocs/pubelectronicas/presenteypasado/ano7vol7/sara_olmos.pdf  ''La Farmacia del Alma: Primera Biblioteca de la Universidad de Los Andes''] Olmos Reverón, 2002, p.42. {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Well into the 1900s (decade), the University Library was not any longer the sole library of the institution. Thence it began to be known as the '''Central Library'''.&lt;ref name="centralserb"&gt;''"A comienzos del siglo XX la Biblioteca de la Universidad se conoce con el nombre de Biblioteca Central [...]".'' {{cite web | url=http://150.185.138.130/informacion//index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=18 |title=Historia|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; It espoused the responsibility of organizing the libraries of the different faculties of the university as they came to existence, and likewise for the training their corresponding personnel. Furthermore, it also conducted the acquisition of all the new resources and equipment for all of the faculty libraries. However, it was the responsibility of every faculty to fund their operation and administration.

== The Coming of Age of SERBIULA ==
In 1977 the libraries of the faculties of [[Natural science|Sciences]], [[Economics|Economic Sciences]], and [[Engineering]], all three located within the same campus, were merged into the ''Integrated Library of Sciences, Economics and Engineering'' (''BIECI'' for its acronym in Spanish). This was the first unification of different library services that took place within the University. A project proposal for taking this initiative to a higher level was put forth the [[University Council]] a couple of years later. The project submitted the comprehensive integration of all the university’s library services into a greater single one. It was swiftly approved on March 6, 1980 and the resulting body was simply named '''University of Los Andes Library Services''' (''SERBIULA''). '''SERBIULA''' had and still has the responsibility of integrating all the existing library services and keeping them up-to-date with the University demands. Additionally, SERBIULA created and manages the university’s [[Integrated library system|Library System]], whose coordination follows a decentralized approach as a consequence of having the University campuses scattered all around the city. Another goal is improving the efficiency of human, technical and financial resources.

== Automation of library services with SERBIULA ==
The [[Library automation#History|automation]] of library services in the University began with the creation of the aforementioned ''BIECI'' library—currently renamed ''BIACI'', but more specifically with the launch of its [[Information communication technology|ICT]] department (simply known as ''Informática''). The broad purpose of this department was and still is to imprint ever more efficient, functional, and modern [[Information retrieval]] processes to the library services. The early stages of this scheme began with the instalment of the following systems:
*Loans control system,
*[[Library catalog|Cataloguing]] of periodic publications and suppliers control system,
*Information retrieval and cataloguing system (use of [[MARC standards]])

This early instalment was followed by the development of some middle-stage projects. These projects definitively ignited and set the pace for the continuous ICT updating and upgrading trend for the SERBIULA library services. Among these, the more important were:
*The onset of the ''Document Cataloguing and Editing system'' (EDICLA), the ''Automated Information Retrieval System'' (SARI), and the ''ULA Loans System'' (SPULA).
*The installation of what would become the first 14 SERBIULA [[local area network]]s (development started between 1977 and 1978)
*The linking of the university to Internet (1986) &lt;ref&gt;''"Primera Universidad del país conectada a Internet".'' [http://www.cybertesis.cl/seminario/presentaciones/archivos/ulosandes-venezuela.pdf First Venezuelan university to be linked to the Internet] Rosales &amp; Torrens, 2002; p.4. {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The massive incorporation of information to the SERBIULA [[database]] (began in 1994).
*ULA theses references input to the electronic catalog of SERBIULA (1995).&lt;ref&gt;''"1995: Incorporación de referencias de Tesis de la ULA en el catálogo electrónico de SERBIULA".'' [http://www.cybertesis.cl/seminario/presentaciones/archivos/ulosandes-venezuela.pdf ULA theses references input to the electronic catalog of SERBIULA] Rosales &amp; Torrens, 2002; p.10. {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The inclusion of automatic [[Expert system|knowledge-based]] [[Index (publishing)|indexing]] to the library services features.

This accumulated know-how resulted in the creation of the ''ULA Information and [[Documentation]] System'' (SIDULA). It was originally designed to be a comprehensive library management system that would physically centralize all the acquisitions, cataloguing and loans. With the evolution in the University networks, it was ultimately redesigned to work as a [[client–server model|client–server system]].

===Present-day SERBIULA===
SERBIULA aims at improving and optimizing all library-related services. In 2000 it established the university's ''Electronic Information Services'' (SIE). In 2003 there were two major additions: the creation of the university’s [[Digital Library]] (''Biblioteca Digital''), one of the university's main responsible organizations for the [[Open access publishing|on-line dissemination]] of its historical, cultural, audiovisual, and scientific-academic heritage and production. And secondly, the incorporation to the later of the ''Index for Venezuelan Science and Technology Journals'' ([[REVENCYT]]) under the [[Scielo|SciELO]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;''"2003 Indice Nacional de Revistas científicas Venezolanas Revencyt bajo la metodología Scielo".'' [http://www.cybertesis.cl/seminario/presentaciones/archivos/ulosandes-venezuela.pdf REVENCYT incorporation under SciELO] Rosales &amp; Torrens, 2002; p.7. {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2005 witnessed the development of the open stack library –somehow a novelty in these latitudes, as well as major physical and virtual revamping and upgrading of the whole library network. It was also the year in which SERBIULA embraced '''LIBRUM'''&lt;ref&gt;''"Puesta en marcha del nuevo gestor de biblioteca LIBRUM".'' [http://viceacademico.ula.ve/gestionva/2do_aniv/docs/SERBIULA.pdf Inception of LIBRUM Integrated Library System] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as its main library management system. LIBRUM&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.librumweb.com/eng/index.html LIBRUM presentation]&lt;/ref&gt; is a locally developed [[GNU General Public License|GNU/GPL]] [[OPAC]] management software that handles cataloguing, item circulation, acquisitions, statistics, user administration, thesaurus and full-text e-publication; most notably under the [[Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting|OAI-PMH]] protocol.

In 2006 the ULA arose as the first&lt;ref&gt;[http://oa.mpg.de/openaccess-berlin/signatories-extended.html 2003 Berlin Declaration signatories] Max Planck Institute&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuelan organization ever to become (alongside three other Latin American organizations) signatory to the [[Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities|2003 Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities]]. This initiative pertains to the online open access of the scientific production of the institution (the ULA for this particular case), thus giving ''Biblioteca Digital'' a new job cut up for itself.

Still under process, the other ULA e-services and projects managed by ''Biblioteca Digital-SERBIULA'' are:
*The online [[Institutional repository|repository]] of undergraduate, Master’s and Doctoral theses of the ULA.
*The [[Index for Venezuelan Science and Technology Journals]] (REVENCYT).
*The development the Venezuelan site for the [[Redalyc|Latin America and The Caribbean, Spain and Portugal Scientific Journals Network - (Redalyc)]].
*The adaptation and migration into Spanish of the ''Electronic Theses and Dissertations Publication System'' (TEDE), originally developed by the Brazilian Science and Technology Information Institute (''IBICT'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0100-19652006000200012&amp;script=sci_arttext Universidad de Los Andes electronic thesis: adaptation and use of the TEDE Plataform]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The coordination of the project ''Venezuelan Electronic Theses Digital Database'' (''BDTV''), with the cooperation of eleven national universities so far, as an effort to create an incontrovertible nationwide repository for this type of documents.

Nationwide recognition presented itself in 2007 under the National Book Award, for the Library Service category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cenal.gob.ve/veredicto-tachira-2007.pdf ''IV Premio Nacional del Libro de Venezuela - Veredicto''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, SERBIULA alongside other branch offices of the university, organized the workshop ''REVENCYT-Redalyc, Taller bi-nacional de Editores de Revistas Científicas Venezolanas'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serbi.ula.ve/tallereditores2008 REVENCYT-Redalyc: Taller bi-nacional para Editores de Revistas Científicas Venezolanas] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; with two main purposes:
*Describe and explain the new policies for REVENCYT editors.
*Explain and reveal the details for Redalyc’s Venezuelan site hosting by the ULA.

{{For|whistleblower protection in the United States|Whistleblower protection in the United States}}

A '''whistleblower''' (also written as '''whistle-blower''' or '''whistle blower''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=whistleblower|title=The American Heritage Dictionary entry: whistleblower|first=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing|last=Company|website=www.ahdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a person who exposes any kind of information or activity that is deemed illegal, [[Ethics|unethical]], or not correct within an [[organization]] that is either private or public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Whistleblowing and Organizational Social Responsibility : A Global Assessment.|last = Vandekerckhove|first = Wim|publisher = Ashgate|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The information of alleged wrongdoing can be classified in many ways: violation of company policy/rules, [[law]], [[regulation]], or threat to public interest/national security, as well as fraud, and [[corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Organizational dissidence: The case of whistle-blowing|last = Near|first = Janet P|date = Feb 1, 1985|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who become whistleblowers can choose to bring information or allegations to surface either internally or externally. Internally, a whistleblower can bring his/her accusations to the attention of other people within the accused organization such as an immediate supervisor. Externally, a whistleblower can bring allegations to light by contacting a third party outside of an accused organization such as the media, government, law enforcement, or those who are concerned. Whistleblowers, however, take the risk of facing stiff reprisal and retaliation from those who are accused or alleged of wrongdoing.

Because of this, a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers. Some third party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers, but that protection can only go so far. Whistleblowers face legal action, criminal charges, social stigma, and termination from any position, office, or job. Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public. The classifications relate to the type of organizations someone chooses to whistle-blow on: [[private sector]], or [[public sector]]. Depending on many factors, both can have varying results. However, whistleblowing in the public sector organization is more likely to result in criminal charges and possible custodial sentences. A whistleblower who chooses to accuse a private sector organization or agency is more likely to face termination and legal and civil charges.

Deeper questions and theories of whistleblowing and why people choose to do so can be studied through an [[ethical]] approach. Whistleblowing is a topic of ongoing ethical debate. Leading arguments in the ideological camp that whistleblowing is ethical maintain that whistleblowing is a form of civil disobedience, and aims to protect the public from government wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;Delmas, Candice. "The Ethics of Government Whistleblowing". ''Social Theory &amp; Practice''. Jan2015, Vol. 41 Issue 1, p77-105. 29p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alford, C. Fred. "Whistleblowers and the Narrative of Ethics". ''Journal of Social Philosophy''. Winter2001, Vol. 32 Issue 4, p402-418. 17p.&lt;/ref&gt; In the opposite camp, some see whistleblowing as unethical for breaching confidentiality, especially in industries that handle sensitive client or patient information.&lt;ref&gt;Firtko, Angela; Jackson, Debra. "Do the Ends Justify the Means? Nursing and the Dilemma of Whistleblowing". ''Australian Journal of Advanced Nursing''. Sep/Nov2005, Vol. 23 Issue 1, p51-56. 6p.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal protection can also be granted to protect whistleblowers, but that protection is subject to many stipulations. Hundreds of laws grant protection to whistleblowers, but stipulations can easily cloud that protection and leave whistleblowers vulnerable to retaliation and legal trouble. However, the decision and action has become far more complicated with recent advancements in technology and [[communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Ethics of Government Whisltleblowing|last = Delmas|first = Candice|date = January 2015|journal = Social Theory and Practice|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whistleblowers frequently face [[reprisal]], sometimes at the hands of the organization or group they have accused, sometimes from related organizations, and sometimes under law. Questions about the legitimacy of whistleblowing, the [[moral responsibility]] of whistleblowing, and the appraisal of the institutions of whistleblowing are part of the field of [[political ethics]].

==Overview==

===Origin of term===
U.S. civic activist [[Ralph Nader]] is said to have coined the phrase, but he in fact put a positive spin on the term&lt;ref&gt;See: New Scientist 9 Dec. 1971, p. 69: "The Code [of Good Conduct of The British Computer Society] contains secrecy clauses that effectively prohibit Nader style whistle-blowing"&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1970s to avoid the negative connotations found in other words such as "informer" and "snitch".&lt;ref&gt;Nader, Petkas, and Blackwell, Whistleblowing (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the origins of the word date back to the [[19th century]].

The word is linked to the use of a [[whistle]] to alert the public or a crowd about a bad situation, such as the commission of a crime or the breaking of rules during a game. The phrase ''whistle blower'' attached itself to law enforcement officials in the 19th century because they used a whistle to alert the public or fellow police.&lt;ref name="Meaning and origin"&gt;{{cite web|title=The meaning and origin of the expression: Whistle-blower|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/whistle-blower.html|website=The Phrase Finder|publisher=Gary Martin|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports referees, who use a whistle to indicate an illegal or foul play, also were called whistle blowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=whistleblower+&amp;searchmode=none |title=Etymonline.com |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/site/whistleblower/ |title=Wordorigins.org |publisher=Wordorigins.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1883 story in the ''Janesville Gazette'' called a policeman who used his whistle to alert citizens about a riot a ''whistle blower'', without the hyphen. By the year 1963, the phrase had become a hyphenated word, ''whistle-blower''. The word began to be used by journalists in the 1960s for people who revealed wrongdoing, such as Nader. It eventually evolved into the compound word ''whistleblower''.&lt;ref name="Meaning and origin" /&gt;

===Internal===
Most whistleblowers are internal whistleblowers, who report misconduct on a fellow employee or superior within their company through anonymous reporting mechanisms often called hotlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Cases|last=|first=|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2017|isbn=978-1305500846|location=|pages=194|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most interesting questions with respect to internal whistleblowers is why and under what circumstances do people either act on the spot to stop illegal and otherwise unacceptable behavior or report it.&lt;ref&gt;Dealing with—or reporting—"unacceptable" behavior (with additional thoughts about the "Bystander Effect") Mary Rowe MIT, Linda Wilcox HMS, Howard Gadlin NIH (2009), ''Journal of the International Ombudsman Association'' 2(1), online at [http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ ombudsassociation.org]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504071949/http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ |date=2009-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some reasons to believe that people are more likely to take action with respect to unacceptable behavior, within an organization, if there are [[complaint systems]] that offer not just options dictated by the planning and control organization, but a ''choice'' of options for absolute confidentiality.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Rowe, "Options and choice for conflict resolution in the workplace" in ''Negotiation: Strategies for Mutual Gain'', by Lavinia Hall (ed.), Sage Publications, Inc., 1993, pp. 105–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anonymous reporting mechanisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/10/25/elements-of-an-effective-whistleblower-hotline/|title=Elements of an Effective Whistleblower Hotline|website=corpgov.law.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; as mentioned previously, help foster a climate whereby employees are more likely to report or seek guidance regarding potential or actual wrongdoing without fear of retaliation. The coming anti-bribery management systems standard, [[ISO 37001]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=65034|title=ISO 37001:2016 - Anti-bribery management systems -- Requirements with guidance for use|website=www.iso.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes anonymous reporting as one of the criteria for the new standard.

===External===
External whistleblowers, however, report misconduct to outside persons or entities. In these cases, depending on the information's severity and nature, whistleblowers may report the misconduct to [[lawyer]]s, the [[Mass media|media]], [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] or [[consumer protection|watchdog agencies]], or other local, state, or federal agencies. In some cases, external whistleblowing is encouraged by offering monetary reward.

===Third party===

The third party service involves utilizing an external agency to inform the individuals at the top of the organizational pyramid of misconduct, without disclosing the identity of the whistleblower. This is a relatively new phenomenon and has been developed due to whistleblower discrimination. International Whistleblowers is an example of an organization involved in delivering a third party service for whistleblowers.

An increasing number of companies and authorities use third party services in which the whistleblower is anonymous also towards the third party service provider. This is possible via toll free phone numbers configured not to record the whistleblower origin call, and also through web solutions which apply [[Public-key cryptography|asymmetrical encryption]].

===Private sector whistleblowing===
Private sector whistleblowing, though not as high profile as public sector whistleblowing, is arguably more prevalent and suppressed in society today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Rise of the Whistleblower and the Death of Privacy Impact of 9/11 and Enron|last = Castagnera|first = James|date = Spring 2003|journal = Labor Law Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply because private corporations usually have stricter regulations that suppress potential whistleblowers. An example of private sector whistleblowing is when an employee reports to someone in a higher position such as a manager, or a third party that is isolated from the individual chapter, such as their lawyer or the police. In the private sector corporate groups can easily hide wrongdoings by individual branches. It is not until these wrongdoings bleed into the top officials that corporate wrongdoings are seen by the public. Situations in which a person may blow the whistle are in cases of violated laws or company policy, such as sexual harassment or theft. These instances, nonetheless, are small compared to [[money laundering]] or [[fraud]] charges on the [[stock market]]. Whistleblowing in the private sector is typically not as high-profile or openly discussed in major news outlets, though occasionally, third parties expose human rights violations and [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Where am I wearing?|last = Timmerman|first = Kelsey|publisher = California: Wiley|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are organizations such as the [[United States Department of Labor]] (DOL), and laws in place such as the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] and the [[United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] for Organizations (FSGO) which protects whistleblowers in the private sector, many employees still fear for their jobs due to direct or indirect threats from their employers or the other parties involved. In an effort to overcome those fears, in 2010 [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] was put forth to provide great incentive to whistleblowers. For example, if a whistleblower gave information which could be used to legally recover over one million dollars; then they could receive ten to thirty percent of it.

Despite government efforts to help regulate the private sector, the employees must still weigh their options. They either expose the company and stand the moral and ethical high ground; or expose the company, lose their job, their reputation and potentially the ability to be employed again. According to a study at the University of Pennsylvania, out of three hundred whistleblowers studied, sixty nine percent of them had foregone that exact situation; and they were either fired or were forced to retire after taking the ethical high ground. It is outcomes like that which makes it all that much harder to accurately track how prevalent whistleblowing is in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Case 10th Edition|last=|first=|publisher=O.C. Ferrell, John Fraedich, Linda Ferrell|year=2014|isbn=978-1285423715|location=|pages=193|quote=|via=Cengage Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public sector whistleblowing===
[[File:Praha, Magistrát, konference, Libor Michálek.jpg|thumb|170px|Czech whistleblower [[Libor Michálek]] was fired from his position after exposing high-level corruption]]
Recognizing the public value of whistleblowing has been increasing over the last 50 years. In the United States, both state and Federal statutes have been put in place to protect whistleblowers from retaliation. The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that public sector whistleblowers are protected under [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights from any job retaliation when they raise flags over alleged corruption.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Whistleblowing|url = http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Whistleblowing|access-date = 2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposing misconduct or illegal or dishonest activity is a big fear for public employees because they feel they are going against their government and country. Private sector whistleblowing protection laws were in place long before ones for the public sector. After many federal whistleblowers were scrutinized in high-profile media cases, laws were finally introduced to protect government whistleblowers. These laws were enacted to help prevent corruption and encourage people to expose misconduct, illegal, or dishonest activity for the good of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Whistleblower Retaliation in the Public Sector|last = Lee|first = Katie|date = 2011|journal = Public Personnel Management|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; People who choose to act as whistleblowers often suffer retaliation from their employer. They most likely are fired because they are an [[at-will employee]], which means they can be fired without a reason. There are exceptions in place for whistleblowers who are at-will employees. Even without a statute, numerous decisions encourage and protect whistleblowing on grounds of public policy. Statutes state that an employer shall not take any adverse employment actions any employee in retaliation for a good-faith report of a whistleblowing action or cooperating in any way in an investigation, proceeding, or lawsuit arising under said action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Federal whistleblower legislation includes a statute protecting all government employees. In the federal civil service, the government is prohibited from taking, or threatening to take, any personnel action against an employee because the employee disclosed information that he or she reasonably believed showed a violation of law, gross mismanagement, and gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public safety or health. To prevail on a claim, a federal employee must show that a protected disclosure was made, that the accused official knew of the disclosure, that retaliation resulted, and that there was a genuine connection between the retaliation and the employee's action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Harm ===
{{Copyedit section|date=October 2018}}
Individual harm, public trust damage, and a threat of national security are three categories of harm that may come to whistleblowers. Revealing a whistleblower's identity automatically puts their life in harm. Some media outlets associate words like "traitor" and "treason" with whistleblowers, and many countries around the world associate treason with the [[capital punishment|death penalty]], even though whoever allegedly committed treason may or may not have caused anyone physical harm.  A primary reason for the death penalty is the potential endangerment of an entire people, the perpetrator therefore being responsible for any harm to come as a result. US law states{{which|date=October 2018}},

"...whoever knowingly and willfully communicates, furnishes, transmits, or otherwise makes available to an unauthorized person, or publishes, or uses in any manner prejudicial to the safety or interest of the United States or for the benefit of any foreign government to the detriment of the United States any classified information."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 18 U.S. Code § 798 - Disclosure of classified information|url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/798|website = LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Ethics of Government Whistleblowing|last = Delmas|first = Candice|date = January 1, 2015|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public trust dates back to the days of the Vietnam War. Henry Kissinger once said that the purpose of "those who stole" the Pentagon Papers was to "undermine confidence in their government" and "raise doubts about our reliability in the minds of other governments, friend and foe, and indeed about the stability of our political system."

Emotional strain on the accused from the whistleblower is also unconstrained.  When a leader challenges a whistleblower, there is an automatic indictment of the leader's character.&lt;ref name="tbo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbo.com/list/news-opinion-commentary/william-mcraven-a-warriors-career-sacrificed-for-politics-20160424/|title=William McRaven: A warrior’s career sacrificed for politics|date=24 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questioning the whistleblower makes the accused guilty until proven innocent.

=== Common reactions ===
Whistleblowers are sometimes seen as selfless [[Martyr (politics)|martyrs]] for public interest and organizational [[accountability]]; others view them as "traitors" or "defectors."  Some even accuse them of solely pursuing personal glory and fame, or view their behavior as motivated by greed in [[qui tam]] cases.  Some academics (such as [[Thomas Alured Faunce]]) feel that whistleblowers should at least be entitled to a rebuttable presumption that they are attempting to apply ethical principles in the face of obstacles and that whistleblowing would be more respected in [[governance]] systems if it had a firmer academic basis in [[virtue ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Faunce, T.A. "Developing and Teaching the Virtue-Ethics Foundations of Healthcare Whistle Blowing", ''Monash Bioethics Review''. 2004; 23(4): 41–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faunce, T.A. and Jefferys, S. "Whistleblowing and scientific misconduct: Renewing legal and virtue ethics foundations". ''Journal of Medicine and Law'' 2007, '''26(3)''': 567–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is probable that many people do not even consider blowing the whistle, not only because of fear of retaliation, but also because of fear of losing their relationships at work and outside work.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Mary &amp; Bendersky, Corinne, "Workplace Justice, Zero Tolerance and Zero Barriers: Getting People to Come Forward in Conflict Management Systems," in ''Negotiations and Change, From the Workplace to Society'', Thomas Kochan and Richard Locke (eds), Cornell University Press, 2002. See also "Dealing with&amp;nbsp;— or Reporting&amp;nbsp;— 'Unacceptable' Behavior (With additional thoughts about the 'Bystander Effect')" ©2009Mary Rowe MIT, Linda Wilcox HMS, Howard Gadlin NIH, ''Journal of the International Ombudsman Association'' 2(1), online at [http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ ombudsassociation.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504071949/http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ |date=2009-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Persecution of whistleblowers'' has become a serious issue in many parts of the world:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Employees in academia, business or government might become aware of serious risks to health and the environment, but internal policies might pose threats of retaliation to those who report these early warnings. Private company employees in particular might be at risk of being fired, demoted, denied raises and so on for bringing environmental risks to the attention of appropriate authorities. Government employees could be at a similar risk for bringing threats to health or the environment to public attention, although perhaps this is less likely.&lt;ref name=late&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/late-lessons-2 |title=Late lessons from early warnings: science, precaution, innovation: Full Report |author=European Environment Agency) |date=Jan 23, 2013 |page=614 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are examples of "early warning scientists" being harassed for bringing inconvenient truths about impending harm to the notice of the public and authorities. There have also been cases of young scientists being discouraged from entering controversial scientific fields for fear of [[harassment]].&lt;ref name=late/&gt;

Whistleblowers are often protected under law from employer retaliation, but in many cases punishment has occurred, such as [[termination of employment|termination]], [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]], [[demotion]], [[wage garnishment]], and/or harsh [[mistreatment]] by other employees. A 2009 study found that up to 38% of whistleblowers experienced professional retaliation in some form, including wrongful termination.{{Citation needed|reason=previous citation of "Miceli, M. P., Near, J. P., &amp; Dworkin, T. M. (2009). Journal of Business Ethics." didn't clearly indicate a source that supports the claim.|date=January 2017}} For example, in the United States, most whistleblower protection laws provide for limited "make whole" remedies or damages for employment losses if whistleblower retaliation is proven. However, many whistleblowers report there exists a widespread "[[Shooting the messenger|shoot the messenger]]" mentality by corporations or government agencies accused of misconduct and in some cases whistleblowers have been subjected to criminal prosecution in reprisal for reporting wrongdoing.

As a reaction to this many private organizations have formed whistleblower [[legal defense fund]]s or support groups to assist whistleblowers; three such examples are the ''National Whistleblowers Center''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whistleblowers.org/ |title=whistleblowers.org |publisher=whistleblowers.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United States]], and ''Whistleblowers UK''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbuk.org/ |title=wbuk.org |publisher=wbuk.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Public Concern at Work]] (PCaW)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcaw.co.uk |title=pcaw.co.uk |publisher=pcaw.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United Kingdom]]. Depending on the circumstances, it is not uncommon for whistleblowers to be ostracized by their co-workers, discriminated against by future potential employers, or even fired from their organization. This campaign directed at whistleblowers with the goal of eliminating them from the organization is referred to as [[mobbing]]. It is an extreme form of [[workplace bullying]] wherein the group is set against the targeted individual.&lt;ref&gt;Matthiesen SB, Bjorkelo B, Burke RJ "Workplace Bullying as the Dark Side of Whistleblowing" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological impact ===
There is limited research on the psychological impacts of whistle blowing. However, poor experiences of whistleblowing can cause a prolonged and prominent assault upon staff well being. As workers attempt to address concerns, they are often met with a wall of silence and hostility by management.&lt;ref&gt;Drew D (29 January 2015) [https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/jan/29/francis-review-nhs-whistleblower-report Francis NHS whistleblower report: a new beginning?] The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; Some whistleblowers speak of overwhelming and persistent distress, drug and alcohol problems, [[paranoid]] behaviour at work, acute [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], [[nightmares]], [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] and [[intrusive thoughts]].&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;Peters, K. et al. (2011). The emotional sequelae of whistleblowing: findings from a qualitative study. Journal of Clinical Nursing, 20: P2907-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Depression is often reported by whistleblowers, and [[suicidal thoughts]] may occur in up to about 10%.&lt;ref&gt;Farnsworth CH (22 February 1987) [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/22/us/survey-of-whistle-blowers-finds-retaliation-but-few-regrets.html Survey of Whistleblowers finds retaliation, but few regrets] The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lennane"&gt;Lennane J (11 September 1993) "Whistleblowing": a health issue. 307(6905): P667–670&lt;/ref&gt; General deterioration in health and self care has been described.&lt;ref&gt;Greaves R, McGlone JK (2012) [http://www.socialmedicine.info/socialmedicine/index.php/socialmedicine/article/view/584 The Health Consequences of Speaking Out] Social Medicine Vol 6, No 4 P259-263&lt;/ref&gt; The range of symptomatology shares many of the features of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], though there is debate about whether the trauma experienced by whistleblowers meets diagnostic thresholds.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørkelo, B. (2013). Workplace bullying after whistleblowing: Future research and implications.

Nursing Standard Feb 12-18;28(24) P14-5&lt;/ref&gt; This fear may indeed be justified, because an individual who feels threatened by whistleblowing, may plan the career destruction of the ‘complainant’ by reporting fictitious errors or rumours.&lt;ref&gt;De Silva, P (2014) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pnp.344/pdf Tackling psychopathy: a necessary competency in leadership development?] Progress in Neurology and Psychiatry September/October&lt;/ref&gt; This technique, labelled as ‘[[gaslighting]]’ is a common, unconventional approach used by organizations to manage employees who cause difficulty by raising concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Lund CA, Gardiner AQ (1977) The gaslight phenomenon: An institutional variant.

The social impact of whistleblowing through loss of livelihood (and sometimes pension), and family strain may also impact on whistleblowers’ psychological well being. Whistleblowers may also experience immense stress as a result of litigation regarding detriments such as unfair dismissal, which they often face with imperfect support or no support at all from unions. Whistleblowers who continue to pursue their concerns may also face long battles with official bodies such as regulators and government departments.&lt;ref name="Eye" /&gt;&lt;ref name="first" /&gt; Such bodies may reproduce the "institutional silence" by employers, adding to whistleblowers’ stress and difficulties.&lt;ref name="Parliament"&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmpubacc/593/593.pdf Public Accounts Committee Report of Inquiry into Whistleblowing, Ninth Report of Session 2014–15])&lt;/ref&gt; In all, some whistleblowers suffer great injustice, that may never be acknowledged or rectified.&lt;ref name="Lennane2" /&gt; Such extreme experiences of threat and loss inevitably cause severe distress and sometimes mental illness, sometimes lasting for years afterwards. This mistreatment also deters others from coming forward with concerns. Thus, poor practices remain hidden behind a wall of silence, and prevent any organization from experiencing the improvements that may be afforded by intelligent failure.&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parliament" /&gt; Some whistleblowers who part ranks with their organizations have had their mental stability questioned, such as [[Adrian Schoolcraft]], the [[NYPD]] veteran who alleged falsified crime statistics in his department and was forcibly committed to a mental institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2010/10/cop-nypd-psych-ward-whistleblowing/|title=Cop hauled off to psych ward after alleging fake crime stats|website=www.rawstory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the emotional strain of a whistleblower investigation is devastating to the accused's family.&lt;ref name="tbo.com"/&gt;

=== Ethics ===
The definition of [[ethics]] is the [[moral]] [[principles]] that govern a person's or group's behavior. The ethical implications of whistleblowing can be negative as well as positive. However, sometimes employees may blow the whistle as an act of revenge. [[Rosemary O'Leary]] explains this in her short volume on a topic called [[guerrilla]] government. "Rather than acting openly, guerrillas often choose to remain "in the closet," moving clandestinely behind the scenes, salmon swimming upstream against the current of power. Over the years, I have learned that the motivations driving guerrillas are diverse. The reasons for acting range from the [[altruistic]] (doing the right thing) to the seemingly petty (I was passed over for that promotion). Taken as a whole, their acts are as awe inspiring as saving human lives out of a love of humanity and as trifling as slowing the issuance of a report out of spite or anger."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ethics of Dissent: Managing Guerrilla Government|last = O'Leary|first = Rosemary|publisher = CQ|year = 2006|isbn = |location = Washington D.C.|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, of the more than 1,000 whistleblower complaints that are filed each year with the Pentagon's Inspector General, about 97 percent are not substantiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/04/25/commander-of-bin-laden-raid-blasts-senate-for-disrespecting-military-leaders/|title=Commander of bin Laden raid blasts Senate for disrespecting military leaders|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed throughout the professional world that an individual is bound to secrecy within their work sector. Discussions of whistleblowing and employee loyalty usually assume that the concept of loyalty is irrelevant to the issue or, more commonly, that whistleblowing involves a moral choice that pits the loyalty that an employee owes an employer against the employee's responsibility to serve the public interest.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Whistleblowing and Employee Loyalty|last = Larmer|first = Robert A.|date = Feb 1992|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert A. Larmer describes the standard view of whistleblowing in the [[Journal of Business Ethics]] by explaining that an employee possesses [[prima facie]] (based on the first impression; accepted as correct until proved otherwise) duties of loyalty and confidentiality to their employers and that whistleblowing cannot be justified except on the basis of a higher duty to the [[public good]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is important to recognize that in any relationship which demands loyalty the relationship works both ways and involves mutual enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Whistleblowing and Employee Loyalty|last = Duska|first = Ronald|date = Feb 1992|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethics of Edward Snowden's actions have been widely discussed and debated in news media and academia worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Mark. "EDWARD SNOWDEN: HERO OR TRAITOR? CONSIDERING THE IMPLICATIONS FOR CANADIAN NATIONAL SECURITY AND WHISTLEBLOWER LAW".&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Snowden released [[Classified information|classified]] intelligence to the American people in an attempt to allow Americans to see the inner workings of the government. A person is diligently tasked with the [[wikt:conundrum|conundrum]] of choosing to be loyal to the company or to blow the whistle on the company's wrongdoing. Discussions on whistleblowing generally revolve around three topics: attempts to define whistleblowing more precisely, debates about whether and when whistleblowing is permissible, and debates about whether and when one has an obligation to blow the whistle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Issues in Business Ethics|last = |first = |publisher = Springer|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = 139–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motivations ===
Many whistleblowers have stated that they were motivated to take action to put an end to unethical practices, after witnessing injustices in their businesses or organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Alexander J. "Using Scholarship on Whistleblowing to Inform Peer Ethics Reporting". Professional Psychology: Research &amp; Practice. Aug2015, Vol. 46 Issue 4: p298–305. 8p.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study found that whistleblowers are often motivated to take action when they notice a sharp decline in ethical practices, as opposed to a gradual worsening.&lt;ref&gt;Gino, F., &amp; Bazerman, M. H. (2009). When misconduct goes unnoticed: The acceptability of gradual erosion in others' unethical behavior. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 45(4), 708-719.&lt;/ref&gt; There are generally two metrics by which whistleblowers determine if a practice is unethical. The first metric involves a violation of the organization's bylaws or written ethical policies. These violations allow individuals to concretize and rationalize blowing the whistle.&lt;ref&gt;Kaptein, Muel (2011). "From Inaction to External Whistleblowing: The Influence of the Ethical Culture of Organizations on Employee Responses to Observed Wrongdoing". Journal of Business Ethics. 98: 513.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, "value-driven" whistleblowers are influenced by their personal codes of ethics. In these cases, whistleblowers have been criticized for being driven by personal biases.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, J. P., &amp; McLain, D. A. (1992). Whistleblowing: A conceptualization and model. In Wall, J. L., &amp; Jauch, K. R. (Eds.), Academy of Management Best Papers Proceedings, August 10–12, Las Vegas, NV, 350–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ethics, social and organizational pressure are a motivating forces. A 2012 study identified that individuals are more likely to blow the whistle when several others know about the wrongdoing, because they would otherwise fear consequences for keeping silent.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, S. N., Robertson, J. C., &amp; Curtis, M. B. "The Effects of Contextual and Wrongdoing Attributes on Organizational Employees' Whistleblowing Intentions Following Fraud." Journal of Business Ethics. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In cases when one person is causing an injustice, the individual who notices the injustice may file a formal report, rather than confronting the wrongdoer, because confrontation would be more emotionally and psychologically stressful.&lt;ref&gt;de Graaf, Gjalt (2010).

==Legality of whistleblowing==
Legal protection for whistleblowing varies from country to country and may depend on the country of the original activity, where and how secrets were revealed, and how they eventually became published or publicized. Over a dozen countries have now adopted comprehensive whistleblower protection laws that create mechanisms for reporting wrongdoing and provide legal protections to whistleblowers. Over 50 countries have adopted more limited protections as part of their anti-corruption, freedom of information, or employment laws.&lt;ref&gt;Banisar, "Whistleblowing: International Standards and Developments", in CORRUPTION AND TRANSPARENCY: DEBATING THE FRONTIERS BETWEEN STATE, MARKET AND SOCIETY, I. Sandoval, ed., World Bank-Institute for Social Research, UNAM, Washington, D.C., 2011 available online at [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1753180 ssrn.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ''For purposes of the English Wikipedia, this section emphasizes the English-speaking world and covers other regimes only insofar as they represent exceptionally greater or lesser protections.''

===Australia===
{{main article|Whistleblower protection in Australia}}
There are laws in a number of states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Whistleblowers Australia |url=http://www.whistleblowers.org.au/ |publisher=Whistleblowers.org.au }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former NSW Police Commissioner Tony Lauer summed up official government and police attitudes as: "Nobody in Australia much likes whistleblowers, particularly in an organization like the police or the government."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Caillier |first=J.G. |date=2015 |title=Transformational Leadership and Whistle-Blowing Attitudes Is This Relationship Mediated by Organizational Commitment and Public Service Motivation? |journal=The American Review of Public Administration |volume=45(4) |pages=458-475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner of Canada (PSIC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psic-ispc.gc.ca/|title=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner of Canada|first=Web Experience|last=Toolkit|website=www.psic-ispc.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a safe and confidential mechanism enabling public servants and the general public to disclose wrongdoings committed in the public sector. It also protects from reprisal public servants who have disclosed wrongdoing and those who have cooperated in investigations. The Office's goal is to enhance public confidence in Canada's federal public institutions and in the integrity of public servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada|first1=PSIC|title=Background, Objectives, Scope|url=http://www.psic.gc.ca/eng/content/background-objectives-scope|publisher=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandated by the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act (The Act), PSIC is a permanent and independent Agent of Parliament. The Act, which came into force on April 15, 2007, applies to most of the federal public sector, approximately 400,000 public servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada|first1=PSIC|title=The Servants Disclosure Protection Act|url=http://www.psic.gc.ca/eng/aboutus/psdpa|publisher=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes government departments and agencies, parent Crown corporations, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and other federal public sector bodies.

Not all disclosures lead to an investigation as the Act sets out the jurisdiction of the Commissioner and gives the option not to investigate under certain circumstances. On the other hand, if PSIC conducts an investigation and finds no wrongdoing was committed, the Commissioner must report his findings to the discloser and to the organization's chief executive. Also, reports of founded wrongdoing are presented before the House of Commons and the Senate in accordance with The Act. As of June 2014, a total of 9 reports have been tabled in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada|first1=PSIC|title=Case Reports|url=http://www.psic-ispc.gc.ca/eng/wrongdoing/casereports|publisher=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also established the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Tribunal (PSDPT) to protect public servants by hearing reprisal complaints referred by the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner. The Tribunal can grant remedies in favour of complainants and order disciplinary action against persons who take reprisals.

PSIC's current Commissioner is Mr. Mario Dion. Previously, he has served in various senior roles in the public service, including as Associate Deputy Minister of Justice, Executive Director and Deputy Head of the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada, and as Chair of the National Parole Board.

===European Union===

The [[European Parliament]] approved a "Whistleblower Protection Directive" containing broad [[free speech]] protections for whistleblowers in both the public and the private sectors, including for [[journalist]]s, in all member states of the [[European Union]]. The Directive prohibits direct or indirect retaliation against employees, current and former, in the public sector and the private sector. The Directive's protections apply to employees, to volunteers, and  to those who assist them, including to [[civil society]] organizations and to journalists who report on their evidence. It provides equal rights for whistleblowers in the national security sector who challenge denial or removal of their security clearances. Also, whistleblowers are protected from criminal prosecution and corporate lawsuits for damages resulting from their whistleblowing, and provides for psychological support for dealing with harassment stress.&lt;ref&gt;[[Government Accountability Project]], 21 Nov. 2018, "[https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2018/11/21/european-parliament-panel-approves-whistleblower-protections-all-eu-countries European Parliament Panel Approves Whistleblower Protections for all EU Countries]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Good government]] observers have hailed the EU directive as setting "the global standard for [[best practice]] rights protecting freedom of speech where it counts the most—challenging abuses of power that betray the [[public trust]]," according to the U.S.-based [[Government Accountability Project]]. They have noted, however, that ambiguities remain in the Directive regarding application in some areas, such as "duty speech," that is, when employees report the same information as part of a job assignment, for example, to a supervisor, instead of whistleblowing as formal [[dissent]]. In fact, duty speech is how the overwhelming majority of whistleblowing information gets communicated, and where the free flow of information is needed for proper functioning of organizations. However it is in response to such "duty speech" employee communication that the vast majority of retaliation against employees occurs. These observers have noted that the Directive must be understood as applying to protection against retaliation for such duty speech because without such an understanding the Directive will "miss the iceberg of what’s needed.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Government Accountability Project]], 21 Nov. 2018, "[https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2018/11/21/european-parliament-panel-approves-whistleblower-protections-all-eu-countries European Parliament Panel Approves Whistleblower Protections for all EU Countries]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jamaica===

It creates a comprehensive system for the protection of whistleblowers in the public and private sector. It is based on the [[Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998]].

===India===
{{main article|Whistleblower protection in India}}
The [[Government of India]] has been considering adopting a whistleblower protection law for several years. In 2003, the Law Commission of India recommended the adoption of the Public Interest Disclosure (Protection of Informers) Act, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/reports/179rptp2.pdf |title=Publin Interest Disclosure Bill |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, the Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill, 2010 was introduced into the [[Lok Sabha]], lower house of the [[Parliament of India]].&lt;ref&gt;The Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill, 2010 [http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/postoftheday/PIDPPMDBill-2010.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill was approved by the cabinet in June, 2011.

The Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2011 has received the Presidential assent on May 9, 2014 and the same has been subsequently published in the official gazette of the Government of India on May 9, 2014 by the Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India.

===Ireland===
The government of [[Ireland]] committed to adopting a comprehensive whistleblower protection law in January 2012. The bill reportedly covers both the public and private sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Whistleblower Bill to cover public and private sectors |newspaper=Irish Times |date=30 January 2011 |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0130/1224310944604.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
The Netherlands has measures in place to mitigate the risks of whistleblowing: the whistleblower advice centre (Adviespunt Klokkenluiders) offers advice to whistleblowers, and the Parliament recently passed a proposal to establish a so-called house for whistleblowers, to protect them from the severe negative consequences that they might endure (Kamerstuk, 2013). Dutch media organizations also provide whistleblower support; on 9 September 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vanaf vandaag: anoniem lekken naar media via doorgeefluik Publeaks|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2694/Tech-Media/article/detail/3506349/2013/09/09/Vanaf-vandaag-anoniem-lekken-naar-media-via-doorgeefluik-Publeaks.dhtml|publisher=volkskrant.nl|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of major Dutch media outlets supported the launch of Publeaks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publeaks.nl|title=Publeaks - Veilig en anoniem informatie delen met de pers|website=www.publeaks.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which provides a secure website for people to leak documents to the media.

===Switzerland===
The Swiss [[Council of States (Switzerland)|Council of States]] agreed on a draft amendment of the [[Swiss Code of Obligations]] in September 2014. The draft introduces articles 321a&lt;sup&gt;bis&lt;/sup&gt; to 321a&lt;sup&gt;septies&lt;/sup&gt;, 328(3), 336(2)(d).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schutz bei Meldung von Unregelmässigkeiten am Arbeitsplatz|url=http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/federal-gazette/2013/9589.pdf|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An amendment of article 362(1) adds articles 321a&lt;sup&gt;bis&lt;/sup&gt; to 321a&lt;sup&gt;septies&lt;/sup&gt; to the list of provisions that may not be overruled by labour and bargaining agreements.&lt;br /&gt;
Article 321a&lt;sup&gt;ter&lt;/sup&gt; introduces an obligation on employees to report irregularities to their employer before reporting to an authority. An employee will, however, not breach his duty of good faith if he reports an irregularity to an authority and
* a period set by the employer and no longer than 60 days has lapsed since the employee has reported the incident to his employer, and
* the employer has not addressed the irregularity or it is obvious that the employer has insufficiently addressed the irregularity.
Article 321a&lt;sup&gt;quarter&lt;/sup&gt; provides that an employee may exceptionally directly report to an authority. Exceptions apply in cases
* where the employee is in a position to objectively demonstrate that a report to his employer will prove ineffective,
* where the employee has to anticipate dismissal,
* where the employee must assume that the competent authority will be hindered in investigating the irregularity, or
* where there is a direct and serious hazard to life, to health, to safety, or to the environment.
The draft does not improve on protection against dismissal for employees who report irregularities to their employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Botschaft über die Teilrevision des Obligationenrechts |url=http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/federal-gazette/2013/9513.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment does not provide for employees [[Anonymity|anonymously]] filing their observations of irregularities.

===United Kingdom===
Whistleblowing in the United Kingdom is subject to the [[Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998|Public Interest Disclosure Act]] (PIDA) 1998.

The [[Freedom to Speak Up Review]] set out 20 principles to bring about improvements to help whistleblowers in the [[National Health Service|NHS]], including:
* Culture of raising concerns&amp;nbsp;– to make raising issues a part of normal routine business of a well-led NHS organization.
* Culture free from bullying&amp;nbsp;– freedom of staff to speak out relies on staff being able to work in a culture which is free from bullying.
* Training&amp;nbsp;– every member of staff should receive training in their trust's approach to raising concerns and in receiving and acting on them.
* Support&amp;nbsp;– all NHS trusts should ensure there is a dedicated person to whom concerns can be easily reported and without formality, a "speak up guardian" .
* Support to find alternative employment in the NHS&amp;nbsp;– where a worker who has raised a concern cannot, as a result, continue their role, the NHS should help them seek an alternative job.

[[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]] produced a whistleblowing policy in November 2015 that all NHS organizations in England are obliged to follow.  It explicitly says that anyone bullying or acting against a whistleblower could be potentially liable to disciplinary action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monitor to reveal national whistleblowing policy|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/workforce/exclusive-monitor-to-reveal-national-whistleblowing-policy/7000188.article|accessdate=18 December 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main article|Whistleblower protection in the United States}}
Whistleblowing tradition in the United States started with [[Benjamin Franklin]] leaking a [[Hutchinson Letters Affair|few letters Hutchinson had written to Thomas Whately]], resulting in the [[American Revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- Strike this entire sentence.  Franklin leaked these letters in 1773, 16 years before the "United States" was incorporated under the ratified Constitution in 1789.  There's no way to support that Franklin "started" the "tradition" of leaking embarrassing information.  Probably more accurate to attribute that honor to John Peter Zenger, but again, we're talking about the tradition within the British empire.  Also, there are dozens of "causes" of the American Revolution.  I have never heard of anyone citing the Hutchinson letter affair as one of them.    --&gt;

To be considered a whistleblower in the [[United States]], most federal whistleblower statutes require that [[federal employee]]s have reason to believe their employer violated some law, rule, or regulation; testify or commence a legal proceeding on the legally protected matter; or refuse to violate the law.

In cases where whistleblowing on a specified topic is protected by statute, U.S. courts have generally held that such whistleblowers are protected from retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oalj.dol.gov/PUBLIC/WHISTLEBLOWER/REFERENCES/REFERENCE_WORKS/EDIG12.HTM |title=DOL.gov |publisher=Oalj.dol.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a closely divided [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision, ''[[Garcetti v. Ceballos]]'' (2006) held that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] [[free speech]] guarantees for government employees do not protect disclosures made within the scope of the employees' duties.

In the United States, legal protections vary according to the subject matter of the whistleblowing, and sometimes the state where the case arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peer.org/state/index.php |title=Peer.org |publisher=Peer.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In passing the 2002 [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]], the Senate Judiciary Committee found that whistleblower protections were dependent on the "patchwork and vagaries" of varying state statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record p. S7412; S. Rep. No. 107–146, 107th Cong., 2d Session 19 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Still, a wide variety of federal and state laws protect employees who call attention to violations, help with enforcement proceedings, or refuse to obey unlawful directions. While this patchwork approach has often been criticized, it also responsible for the United States having more dedicated whistleblowing laws than any other country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Transatlantic Whistleblowing.|last = Gerdemann|first = Simon|publisher = Mohr Siebeck|year = 2018|isbn = 978-3-16-155917-4|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first US law adopted specifically to protect whistleblowers was the 1863 United States [[False Claims Act]] (revised in 1986), which tried to combat fraud by suppliers of the United States government during the [[American Civil War]]. The Act encourages whistleblowers by promising them a percentage of the money recovered by the government and by protecting them from employment retaliation.&lt;ref name="answers1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/whistleblower |title=Answers.com |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another US law that specifically protects whistleblowers is the [[Lloyd–La Follette Act]] of 1912. It guaranteed the right of federal employees to furnish information to the [[United States Congress]]. The first US environmental law to include an employee protection was the [[Clean Water Act]] of 1972. Similar protections were included in subsequent federal environmental laws, including the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (1974), [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (1976), [[Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976]], [[Energy Reorganization Act of 1974]] (through 1978 amendment to protect nuclear whistleblowers), [[Superfund|Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or the Superfund Law)]] (1980), and the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] (1990). Similar employee protections enforced through OSHA are included in the [[Surface Transportation Assistance Act]] (1982) to protect truck drivers, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act (PSIA) of 2002, the [[Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century]] ("AIR 21"), and the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, enacted on July 30, 2002 (for corporate fraud whistleblowers).

Investigation of retaliation against whistleblowers under 20 federal statutes falls under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Whistleblower Protection Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whistleblowers.gov |title=Whistleblowers.gov |publisher=Whistleblowers.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States Department of Labor|United States Department of Labor's]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov |title=DOL.gov |publisher=DOL.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov |title=Osha.gov |publisher=Osha.gov |date=2012-04-28 |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; New whistleblower statutes enacted by Congress, which are to be enforced by the Secretary of Labor, are generally delegated by a Secretary's Order&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=FEDERAL_REGISTER&amp;p_id=21749 |title=Osha.gov |publisher=Osha.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; to OSHA's Office of the Whistleblower Protection Program (OWPP).

The patchwork of laws means that victims of retaliation need to be aware of the laws at issue to determine the deadlines and means for making proper complaints. Some deadlines are as short as 10 days (Arizona State Employees have 10 days to file a "Prohibited Personnel Practice" Complaint before the Arizona State Personnel Board), while others are up to 300 days.

Those who report a false claim against the federal government, and suffer adverse employment actions as a result, may have up to six years (depending on state law) to file a civil suit for remedies under the US [[False Claims Act]] (FCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|31|3730}} (h)&lt;/ref&gt; Under a ''[[qui tam]]'' provision, the "original source" for the report may be entitled to a percentage of what the government recovers from the offenders. However, the "original source" must also be the first to file a federal civil complaint for recovery of the federal funds fraudulently obtained, and must avoid publicizing the claim of fraud until the [[United States Department of Justice|US Justice Department]] decides whether to prosecute the claim itself. Such ''qui tam'' lawsuits must be filed under seal, using special procedures to keep the claim from becoming public until the federal government makes its decision on direct prosecution.

[[Espionage Act of 1917|The Espionage Act of 1917]] has been used to prosecute whistleblowers in the United States including [[Edward Snowden]] and [[Chelsea Manning]]. In 2013, Manning was convicted of violating the Espionage Act and sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking sensitive military documents to [[WikiLeaks]].&lt;ref&gt;Madar, Chase. "The Trials of Bradley Manning". Nation. 8/19/2013, Vol. 297 Issue 7/8, p12-17. 5p.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Snowden was charged with violating the Espionage Act for releasing confidential documents belonging to the [[National Security Agency|NSA]].&lt;ref&gt;Bamford, James. "Watch Thy Neighbor". Foreign Policy. Mar/Apr2016, Issue 217, p76-79. 3p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 922 of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] (Dodd-Frank) in the United States incentivizes and protects whistleblowers.&lt;ref&gt;"Dodd-Frank Section 922" (PDF). sec.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; By Dodd-Frank, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) financially rewards whistleblowers for providing original information about violations of federal securities laws that results in sanctions of at least $1M.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"Dodd-Frank Act Rulemaking: Whistleblower Program". www.sec.gov.

The federally recognized [[National Whistleblower Appreciation Day]] is observed annually on July 30, on the anniversary of the country's original 1778 whistleblower protection law.

===Other countries===
There are comprehensive laws in [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]]. A number of other countries have recently adopted comprehensive whistleblower laws including [[Ghana]], [[South Korea]], and [[Uganda]]. They are also being considered in [[Kenya]] and [[Rwanda]]. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in 2008 that whistleblowing was protected as freedom of expression. And in February 2017, [[Nigeria]] also set up the whistleblowing policy against corruption and other ills in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Guja v. Moldova, Application no. 14277/04 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy for whistleblower rights and protections==
Many [[NGOs]] advocate for stronger and more comprehensive legal rights and protections for whistleblowers. Among them are the [[Government Accountability Project]] (GAP), Blueprint for Free Speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blueprintforfreespeech.net/|title=Blueprint for Free Speech – Meet the whistleblowers|website=blueprintforfreespeech.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public Concern at Work]] (PCaW) and the Open Democracy Advice Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.org.za/|title=Home|first=Super|last=User|website=www.opendemocracy.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern methods used for whistleblower protection ==
Whistleblowers that may be at risk of those they are exposing are now using [[encryption]] methods and anonymous content sharing software to protect their identity. [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], a highly accessible anonymity network, is one that is frequently used by whistleblowers around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/sec11/tech/full_papers/Mittal.pdf|title = PIR-Tor: Scalable Anonymous Communication Using Private Information Retrieval.|last = Mittal|first = Prateek|date = 2001|journal = USENIX Security Symposium|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tor has undergone a number of large security updates to protect the identities of potential whistleblowers who may wish to anonymously leak information.&lt;ref&gt;"Security upgrade for 'anonymity network'". New Scientist. 8/11/2007, Vol. 195 Issue 2616, p23-23. 1p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently specialized whistleblowing software like [[SecureDrop]] and [[GlobaLeaks]] has been built on top of the Tor technology in order to incentivize and simplify its adoption for secure whistleblowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frediani|first1=Carola|title=After NSA Scandal, Crop of Whistleblower Communication Tools for Journalists Emerge|url=http://techpresident.com/news/24526/after-NSA-whistleblower-tools-for-journalists|website=[[TechPresident]]|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Andy|title=Whistleblowers Beware: Apps Like Whisper and Secret Will Rat You Out|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/whistleblowers-beware/|website=[[Wired (website)]]|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==

In 2016, the rock band [[Thrice]] released a song titled "Whistleblower" off of the album ''[[To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere]]''. The song is written from the perspective of Snowden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Montemarano|first1=Mike|url=http://www.baeblemusic.com/musicblog/4-25-2016/blood-on-the-sand-a-conversation-with-thrice.html |title='Blood on the Sand:' A Conversation With Thrice |publisher=Baeble Music |accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, [[CBS]] will debut a new reality television show entitled "[[Whistleblower_(U.S._TV_program)|Whistleblower]]", hosted by lawyer, former judge and police officer [[Alex Ferrer]] which will cover [[qui tam]] suits under the [[False Claims Act]] against companies that have allegedly defrauded the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/07/17/plaintiffs-lawyers-get-tv-time-as-cbs-launches-whistleblower-reality-show/?slreturn=20180618111845|title=Plaintiffs Lawyers Get TV Time as CBS Launches Whistleblower Reality Show {{!}} The American Lawyer|work=The American Lawyer|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Education in the U.S.}}
The '''White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics'''
is a multi-agency working group within the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] charged with strengthening the nation's capacity to provide high quality education while increasing opportunities for [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]] participation in federal education programs. In addition, the Initiative serves as a resource for information related to closing the educational achievement gap for Hispanic Americans. Finally, the Initiative provides staffing to support and coordinate the mission of a President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanics.

==Organization==
Despite its title, the Initiative is created by [[Executive Order (United States)|executive order]] as a fully staffed and funded entity within the [[United States Department of Education]]. Its purpose is to provide support for a Presidential Advisory Commission, for organizational purposes also located within the Education Department, which in turn provides advice and guidance to the [[Secretary of Education]] and, through him, to the [[President of the United States|President]].

===President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanics===
The size of the Commission changes with each new Administration, numbering anywhere between fifteen and twenty-five members, and is usually led by two co-chairs. Commissioners are chosen from a wide variety of backgrounds such as educational/academic, sports figures, business, and entertainment and other celebrities. Membership is honorary and the Commissioners serve without pay. All represent either highly visible Hispanic Americans distinguished in their field or other individuals noted for their commitment to Hispanic matters. In order to fulfill its mission of providing guidance, the Commission issues reports- at regular or irregular intervals depending on its individual directive.

===White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics===
As previously noted, the Initiative is a fully staffed office within the Education Department. It is composed of a mix of appointed and civil service officials and led by an Executive Director. The Director is named either by the President or the Secretary of Education. The Initiative's mission ends with the Administration that created it but the agency does not completely shut down. As a regularly staffed unit, the Initiative continues into a new Administration with a "skeleton crew" on the expectation that a new executive order will be issued or until such time as the staff is reassigned by the Secretary.

==History==

===First Bush Administration===
The Commission and Initiative were initially created during the [[George H.W. Bush]] Administration as a part of its overall "America 2000 Education Strategy."  For at least two years, Hispanic organizations and individuals- [[Raul Yzaguirre]] of the [[National Council of La Raza]] prominent among them- had been lobbying the government for a federal agency that would oversee educational outreach for Hispanic Americans and help to improve their academic performance. After months of negotiation and planning, President Bush signed Executive Order 12729 on September 24, 1990, establishing the first Commission as well as the supporting Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Merl, [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-27/news/mn-404_1_bilingual-education "New Ways Sought to Boost Latino Education,"] ''Los Angeles Times'' (January 27, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Marcus and Kenneth J. Cooper, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1149496.html "Hispanic Initiative Begun,"] ''The Washington Post'' (September 25, 1990). Via ''Highbeam Research''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of the Commission as outlined in EO 12729 was to "provide advice to the Secretary of Education on the progress of Hispanic Americans toward achievement of national education goals and on such other aspects of the educational status of Hispanic Americans as it consider[ed] appropriate." To that end, the Commission was expected to urge upon the Secretary a specific set of criteria:

* Enhance parental involvement;
* Promote early childhood education;
* Remove barriers to success in education and work, particularly limited proficiency in the English language;
* Help students to achieve their potential at all educational levels;
* Increase private sector and community involvement in improving education.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Woolley and Gerhard Peters, [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=23738 "Executive Order 12729 - Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans, September 24, 1990,"] ''The American Presidency Project'' (Santa Barbara: University of California). Accessed on August 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the new endeavor ran almost immediately into roadblocks that would delay its implementation for a year.

Within a few days, the first Initiative director, Gilbert Roman, resigned for unknown reasons. The forced resignation of Secretary of Education [[Lauro Cavazos]] in early December put the Initiative and Commission into semi-hibernation. Finally, after increasing criticism, the first group of 17 Commission members were sworn-in in September, 1991. The Initiative also received a full staff and new Executive Director, John Florez, formerly the deputy assistant secretary for employment at the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]]. At Cavazos' request, Florez had been involved in the studies that led to the creation of the Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Sotomayor, [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-10-10/news/ti-1_1_bilingual-education "Bush's Moves on Education Stir Hopes, Criticism,"] ''Los Angeles Times'' (October 10, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable figures among the Commission included Yzaguirre, [[Diana Natalicio]] (the first female president of the [[University of Texas at El Paso]]), businessman [[Peter H. Coors]], and golfer [[Nancy Lopez]].

The Commission issued its sole report on October 12, 1992, entitled ''[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/13/91/c1.pdf A Progress Report to the Secretary of Education from the President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans]''.

===Clinton Administration===
[[File:Our Nation On the Fault Line cover.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of the 1996 PAC report, "Our Nation on the Fault Line."]]
The Commission was re-established by President [[Bill Clinton]] on February 18, 1994 by Executive Order 12900. Like its predecessor, the new Commission was to advise the President (albeit through the Secretary of Education). Its goals were modified slightly from that of the previous Administration. The Commission was oriented to

* Report the progress of Hispanic Americans toward achievement of the National Education Goals and other standards of educational accomplishment;
* Oversee the development, monitoring, and coordination of Federal efforts to promote high-quality education for Hispanic Americans;
* Develop ways to increase State, private sector, and community involvement in improving education;
* Develop ways to expand and complement Federal education initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Woolley and Gerhard Peters, [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=49684 "Executive Order 12900 - Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans, February 22, 1994,"] ''The American Presidency Project'' (Santa Barbara: University of California). Accessed on August 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, once again other political issues would push implementation of the Commission's mission onto the backburner for nearly a year. Finally, on February 1, 1995, 24 members of the Commission were sworn-in by Vice President [[Al Gore]]. Among the more notable figures on the Commission were academicians [[Guillermo Linares]] and [[Eduardo J. Padrón]], author/producer [[John Phillip Santos]], businesspersons [[Linda G. Alvarado]] and [[Frontenac Company|Martin J. Koldyke]], and Yzaguirre, who served as its chairman.

Within a year, the Commission would become embroiled in further controversy when Yzaguirre, its chairman, accused it of being ineffective due to "bureaucratic morass and partisan politics" and criticized the Initiative's staff for inadequate support. Yzaguirre was especially incensed that its first report was nearly a year overdue.&lt;ref&gt;Steven A. Holmes, [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/14/us/hispanic-rights-chief-quits-clinton-panel.html "Hispanic Rights Chief Quits Clinton Panel,"] ''The New York Times'' (April 14, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ines Pinto Alicea, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-494398681.html "Controversy Swirls Around the Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans,"] ''The Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education'' (August 2, 1996). Via ''Highbeam Research''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, the Clinton Administration thanked Yzaguirre for his service and announced that the long-awaited report was due to be completed in June.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Press Secretary, U.S. Department of Education, [http://www.ed.gov/PressReleases/04-1996/hispanic.html "Statement by the President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans Vice Chair Ana "Cha" Guzman Regarding the Resignation of Commission Chair Raul Yzaguirre,"] (press release) ''ED.gov'' (April 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, it was not until September that the Commission issued ''[http://www.ed.gov/pubs/FaultLine/index.html Our Nation on the Fault Line: Hispanic American Education]''.

A new Executive Director, Sarita Brown, was named in 1997. Subsequent to her appointment, Brown was credited with revitalizing the Initiative's mission as well as placing renewed focus on funding for Hispanic education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsfi.org/institute/pdf/Brown_bio.pdf "Sarita E. Brown, President, Hispanic Scholarship Fund Institute,"] ''HSFI.org''. Accessed on August 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 25, 2000, the Commission- now chaired by Linares- released its second report entitled ''[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/16/8e/69.pdf Creating the Will: Hispanics Achieving Educational Excellence]''.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, [https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2000/00-136.html "Director of White House Initiative for Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans to Deliver Hispanic Heritage Month Keynote,"] (press release) ''News From the Library of Congress'' (September 19, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kim L.

===Second Bush Administration===
[[File:Pres commission.jpg|thumb|right|President Bush signs Executive Order 13230, October 12, 2001]]
[[George W. Bush]] established his President's Advisory Commission on October 12, 2001 with Executive Order 13230. The Commission's mandate was updated to dispense advice and issue reports in order to

* Map the progress of Hispanic Americans in closing the academic achievement gap and attaining the goals established by the President's "No Child Left Behind" educational blueprint;
* Develop, monitor, and coordinate Federal efforts to promote high-quality education for Hispanic Americans;
* Develop ways to increase parental, State and local, private sector, and community involvement in improving education;
* Develop ways to maximize the effectiveness of Federal education.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Woolley and Gerhard Peters, [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=61511 "Executive Order 13230 - Presidents Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans, October 12, 2001,"] ''The American Presidency Project'' (Santa Barbara: University of California). Accessed on August 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission comprised 20 members and met for their first full meeting in February, 2002. Among its more notable members were academician [[Alexander Gonzalez]], judge [[Micaela Alvarez]], businessmen [[Charles Patrick Garcia|Charles P. Garcia]] and [[Frank Hanna III]]- the latter of whom served as one of the two co-chairs- astronaut [[Fernando Caldeiro]], teacher [[Jaime Escalante]], and singer/songwriter [[Jon Secada]]. Additionally, [[US Treasurer]] [[Rosario Marin]], [[HUD Secretary]] [[Mel Martinez]], and [[Small Business Administration|SBA]] Administrator [[Hector Barreto]] sat on the Commission as ''[[Ex officio|ex offico]]'' members or designees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yic.gov/paceea/index.html "President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans,"] ''About Us'' (WHIEEHA web site). Accessed on August 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this Administration, the Commission issued two reports. The first, entitled ''[http://www.yic.gov/paceea/finalinterim.pdf The Road to a College Diploma: The Complex Reality of Raising Educational Achievement for Hispanics in the United States]'', was released on September 30, 2002 and contained initial findings on the state of Hispanic education in the U. S. The second report, ''[http://www.yic.gov/paceea/finalreport.pdf From Risk to Opportunity: Fulfilling the Educational Needs of Hispanic Americans in the 21st Century]'' and released on March 31, 2003, offered six recommendations for increasing the educational achievement of Hispanics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hispanicprwire.com/news.php?l=in&amp;id=335 President's Advisory Commission on Education Excellence for Hispanic Americans Releases Final Report;..."] (press release) ''Hispanic PR Wire - US Newswire'' (April 9, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

From June 16 to June 17, 2005, the Initiative hosted a conference entitled ''[http://www.yesican.gov/publications/pdf/pathways.pdf Pathways to Hispanic Family Learning]''. Presided over by Education Secretary [[Margaret Spellings]] and U.S. Treasurer [[Anna Escobedo Cabral]], the meeting paved the way for a new program, the ''Partnership for Hispanic Family Learning'', "a national network of public and private organizations that provide Hispanic families with the knowledge and tools needed to help them prepare their children for academic success."  Information and resources were then dispensed through a series of regional conferences.&lt;ref&gt;White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans [http://www.yic.gov/hfl/index.html "Partnership for Hispanic Family Learning."] Accessed on August 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Initiative convened a conference with the American Competitiveness Initiative ('''ACI'''), ''[http://www.yic.gov/aci/booklet.pdf The American Competitiveness Initiative: Challenges and Opportunities for Hispanic Serving Institutions]''. As a result of the meeting, a combined WHI-ACI working-group was formed to address the needs, strengths, and capabilities of [[Hispanic-serving institution]]s of higher learning.&lt;ref&gt;White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans, [http://www.yic.gov/aci/index.html "Stem Legislation,"] ''Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Education for Hispanics''.

===Obama Administration===
[[File:Executive Order Signing Ceremony at the White House 62.jpg|thumb|right|President Obama signs Executive Order 13555, October 19, 2010]]
In July, 2009, the [[Barack Obama]] Administration initiated a series of speaking events and meetings in order to gather input on the educational needs of the Hispanic community. A new executive order was planned for later in the year once the accumulated data could be assessed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2009/07/07102009a.html "White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans Begins a Series of 'Community Conversations',"] (press release) ''ED.gov'' (July 10, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The President set a new goal for the country: that by 2020, America would once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. . On October 19, 2010, President Obama signed Executive Order 13555 renewing the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanic with the mission to help restore the United States to its role as the global leader in education and to strengthen the Nation by expanding educational opportunities and improving educational outcomes for Hispanics of all ages and by helping to ensure that all Hispanics receive a complete and competitive education that prepares them for college, a career, and productive and satisfying lives. In the executive order, the President declared, "Our country was built on and continues to thrive on its diversity, and there is no doubt that the future of the United States is inextricably linked to the future of the Hispanic community." The President appointed a new commission as well, chaired by [[Eduardo J. Padrón|Eduardo Padrón]], and including notable members such as [[Shakira]]. It should be noted however, that according to transcripts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.ed.gov/hispanic-initiative/files/2014/05/Transcript-for-Main-Committee-and-Early-Education-Subcommittee-Breakout.pdf|title=MEETING OF PRESIDENT'S ADVISORY COMMISSION ON EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE FOR HISPANICS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakira never attended the meetings and had Maria Mercedes Lievano sit on her behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.ed.gov/hispanic-initiative/files/2012/11/0428DED-Breakout1.pdf|title=PRESIDENT'S ADVISORY COMMISSION ON EDUCATION EXCELLENCE FOR HISPANICS: EARLY LEARNING SUBCOMMITTEE BREAKOUT SESSION}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.ed.gov/hispanic-initiative/files/2012/11/111195-Early-Learning-Subcommittee-Meeting-uncertified.pdf|title=SPRING 2005 PRESIDENT'S ADVISORY COMMISSION ON EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE FOR HISPANICS PUBLIC MEETING: Early Learning Subcommittee Meeting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.ed.gov/hispanic-initiative/files/2014/05/Transcript-for-Early-Learning-Education-Subcommittee-Breakout_April2014.pdf|title=PRESIDENT'S ADVISORY COMMISSION ON EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE FOR HISPANICS:EARLY LEARNING SUBCOMMITTEE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, 2011, the White House released a report on the education of Latinos, Winning the Future: Improving Education for the Latino Community.

In October 2013, the Initiative also launched a monthly webinar series. The webinars’ purpose is to connect leaders on a national and local scale, as well as highlight Bright Spots- programs, leaders, schools, organizations, partnerships, or models that are helping close the Hispanic achievement gap throughout the nation. The webinars are a meeting place where leaders discuss programs and initiatives, relevant policy issues, and evidence-based practices that benefit the Hispanic community. The Initiative has held webinars on:
•	Early Learning (October)
•	Immigrant Integration (November)
•	Family Engagement (December)
•	Student Financial Assistance (January)
•	GED Test (February)
•	English Learners (March)
•	New High School Equivalency Assessments – HiSET and TASC (April)
•	Improving Educational Outcomes for Hispanic Males (April)
•	Summer Melt (May)
•	Hispanic Families and Special Education (June)
•	Educational Technology (July)
•	Hispanic Teacher Recruitment (August)
•	College- and Career-Ready Standards (September)

In December 2013, Executive Director Alejandra Ceja announced the release of the Initiative's Second Term Action Plan for the fiscal years 2013-2016. The plan establishes "a framework that involves local, state and national leaders, public and private sector stakeholders, educators, families, and students in support of fostering educational excellence for the Latino community. In tandem with the Administration’s efforts, the Initiative will work to amplify the benefits of a quality early learning, highlight robust and leading examples of reform and rigor in our K-12 school systems, and promote practices and institutions of higher education graduating more Latinos ready and prepared to enter the competitive workforce (Ceja)."

In May 2014 the Initiative released ¡Gradúate! A Financial Aid Guide to Success to help Hispanic students and their families navigate through the college application process, provide tips on filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, and supply key financial aid resources available to better support Hispanics, including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and non U.S. citizen students. Since its release the guide has been highlighted by Secretary of Education [[Arne Duncan]].

The Initiative has also advanced President Obama's My Brother's Keeper Initiative to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color, including Hispanics, and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential.

The year 2015 will mark 25 years since the establishment of the Initiative.To commemorate it, the Initiative has launched a 25th anniversary year of action: Fulfilling America's Future to highlight educational gains and trends since its creation, as well as look to the future and make key policy recommendations for leadership across sectors. As a part of its 25th anniversary celebration, the Initiative will release a blueprint that will inform educational priorities for the Hispanic community, and serve as a guide for leaders working to increase opportunity and improve the outcomes of Hispanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/10/19/executive-order-13555-white-house-initiative-educational-excellence-hisp|title=Executive Order 13555--White House Initiative On Educational Excellence For Hispanics|date=19 October 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
