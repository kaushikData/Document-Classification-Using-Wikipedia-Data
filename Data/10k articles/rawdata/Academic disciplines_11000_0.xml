[[File:Laura Bush talks with African boy.jpg|thumb|275px|[[Laura Bush]] with an [[AIDS orphan]] at a center in [[HIV/AIDS in Zambia|Zambia]] that promotes abstinence and faith for youth.]]
'''Abstinence-only sex education''' is a form of [[sex education]] that teaches [[Sexual abstinence|not having sex]] outside of marriage. It often excludes other types of [[sexual and reproductive health]] education, such as [[birth control]] and [[safe sex]]. [[Comprehensive Sex Education|Comprehensive sex education]], by contrast, covers the use of birth control and sexual abstinence.

Evidence does not support the effectiveness of abstinence-only sex education.&lt;ref name=Obs2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/GCO.0b013e3282efdc0b |pmid=17885460 |title=Abstinence and abstinence-only education |journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=446–52 |year=2007 |last1=Ott |first1=Mary A |last2=Santelli |first2=John S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chin2012&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2011.11.006 |pmid=22341164 |title=The Effectiveness of Group-Based Comprehensive Risk-Reduction and Abstinence Education Interventions to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Adolescent Pregnancy, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, and Sexually Transmitted Infections |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=272–94 |year=2012 |last1=Chin |first1=Helen B |last2=Sipe |first2=Theresa Ann |last3=Elder |first3=Randy |last4=Mercer |first4=Shawna L |last5=Chattopadhyay |first5=Sajal K |last6=Jacob |first6=Verughese |last7=Wethington |first7=Holly R |last8=Kirby |first8=Doug |last9=Elliston |first9=Donna B |last10=Griffith |first10=Matt |last11=Chuke |first11=Stella O |last12=Briss |first12=Susan C |last13=Ericksen |first13=Irene |last14=Galbraith |first14=Jennifer S |last15=Herbst |first15=Jeffrey H |last16=Johnson |first16=Robert L |last17=Kraft |first17=Joan M |last18=Noar |first18=Seth M |last19=Romero |first19=Lisa M |last20=Santelli |first20=John }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found to be ineffective in decreasing [[HIV]] risk in the [[developed world]].&lt;ref name=Un2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005421.pub2 |title=Abstinence-only programs for HIV infection prevention in high-income countries |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2007 |last1=Underhill |first1=Kristen |last2=Operario |first2=Don |last3=Montgomery |first3=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not decrease rates of sexual activity or [[unplanned pregnancy]] when compared to comprehensive sex education.&lt;ref name=Obs2007/&gt;

The topic of abstinence-only education is controversial in the United States, with proponents claiming that comprehensive sex education encourages premarital sexual activity, and critics arguing that abstinence-only education is religiously motivated and that the approach has been proven ineffective and even detrimental to its own aims.

==Description==
Abstinence education teaches children and [[adolescents]] to abstain from sexual activity, and that this is the only certain method of avoiding pregnancy and [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs). With a heavy focus on the importance of "family values," programs also teach that abstinence until marriage is a standard by which to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/edth.12034 |title=Just the Facts? The Separation of Sex Education from Moral Education |journal=Educational Theory |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=443–60 |year=2013 |last1=Lamb |first1=Sharon }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid17162310&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1931-2393.2006.tb00277.x |pmid=17162310 |title=Changes in Formal Sex Education: 1995?2002 |journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=182–9 |year=2006 |last1=Lindberg |first1=Laura Duberstein |last2=Santelli |first2=John S |last3=Singh |first3=Susheela }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
[[Systematic review]]s of research evaluating abstinence-only sex education have concluded that it is ineffective at preventing [[unwanted pregnancy]] or the spread of STIs, among other shortfalls.&lt;ref name=Obs2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirby2007"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kirby, D.|title=Emerging Answers 2007: Research Findings on Programs to Reduce Teen Pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Diseases|publisher=National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy|year=2007|url=http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125612/http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report|archivedate=2014-07-14|df=}} {{cite web |url=http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125612/http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid27677440&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17437199.2016.1240625 |pmid=27677440 |title=A comprehensive review of reviews of school-based interventions to improve sexual-health |journal=[[Health Psychology Review]] |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=33–52 |year=2016 |last1=Denford |first1=Sarah |last2=Abraham |first2=Charles |last3=Campbell |first3=Rona |last4=Busse |first4=Heide }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] has recommended against the use of abstinence-only sex education because it has been found to be ineffective, and because the media frequently conveys information about non-abstinence.&lt;ref name=pmid20805150&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.2010-1544 |pmid=20805150 |title=Sexuality, Contraception, and the Media |journal=Pediatrics |volume=126 |issue=3 |pages=576–82 |year=2010 |last1=Strasburger |first1=V. C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== STI transmission ===
A 2015 meta-analysis found that abstinence-focused programs had no effect on the likelihood of contracting STDs.&lt;ref name=pmid26149164&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2174/1570162x13666150511143943 |pmid=26149164 |title=Effective Evidence-Based Programs for Preventing Sexually-Transmitted Infections: A Meta-Analysis |journal=Current HIV Research |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=432–8 |year=2015 |last1=Petrova |first1=Dafina |last2=Garcia-Retamero |first2=Rocio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Cochrane systematic review suggests that abstinence-only education neither increases nor decreases HIV risk in high-income countries.&lt;ref name=Un2007/&gt; In the developing world there is a lack of evidence of effect.&lt;ref name=pmid24594648&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0089692 |pmid=24594648 |pmc=3942389 |title=School Based Sex Education and HIV Prevention in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=e89692 |year=2014 |last1=Fonner |first1=Virginia A |last2=Armstrong |first2=Kevin S |last3=Kennedy |first3=Caitlin E |last4=O'Reilly |first4=Kevin R |last5=Sweat |first5=Michael D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Douglas Kirby]] reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of abstinence-only education programs and found little evidence to justify the use of such programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1525/srsp.2008.5.3.18 |title=The impact of abstinence and comprehensive sex and STD/HIV education programs on adolescent sexual behavior |journal=Sexuality Research and Social Policy |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=18 |year=2008 |last1=Kirby |first1=Douglas B }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 meta-analysis found that it was ineffective at reducing the risk of HIV infection among adolescents.&lt;ref name=pmid21199984&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2010.251 |title=Interventions to Reduce Sexual Risk for Human Immunodeficiency Virus in Adolescents |journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine |volume=165 |year=2011 |last1=Johnson |first1=Blair T |last2=Scott-Sheldon |first2=Lori A. J |last3=Huedo-Medina |first3=Tania B |last4=Carey |first4=Michael P |pmc=4361805 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abstinence education has also been found to include misleading medical information and exclude potentially life-saving information about sexual risk reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17441692.2012.759609 |pmid=23327516 |pmc=3984004 |title=Abstinence promotion under PEPFAR: The shifting focus of HIV prevention for youth |journal=Global Public Health |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |year=2013 |last1=Santelli |first1=John S |last2=Speizer |first2=Ilene S |last3=Edelstein |first3=Zoe R }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study found "that state-level abstinence education mandates have no effect on teen birth rates or abortion rates, although we find that state-level policies may affect teen sexually transmitted disease rates in some states."&lt;ref name=pmid26918400&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/hec.3315 |pmid=26918400 |title=The Effects of State-Mandated Abstinence-Based Sex Education on Teen Health Outcomes |journal=Health Economics |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=403–420 |year=2017 |last1=Carr |first1=Jillian B |last2=Packham |first2=Analisa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pregnancy ===
Research conducted on 48 states of United States showed that "The level of abstinence education (no provision, covered, promoted, stressed) was positively correlated with both teen pregnancy and teen birth rates.&lt;ref name=pmid22022362/&gt; Also, in John S. Santelli's research, the decline of teenage pregnancy rates during 1995&amp;ndash;2002 were largely due to improved contraception, and the reduction in pregnancy risk among teenagers at age of 18 or 19 is entirely ascribed to more contraception.&lt;ref name=pmid17138906&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2006.089169 |pmid=17138906 |pmc=1716232 |title=Explaining Recent Declines in Adolescent Pregnancy in the United States: The Contribution of Abstinence and Improved Contraceptive Use |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=150–6 |year=2007 |last1=Santelli |first1=John S |last2=Lindberg |first2=Laura Duberstein |last3=Finer |first3=Lawrence B |last4=Singh |first4=Susheela }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[SIECUS]], the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, "[s]cientific evidence simply does not support an abstinence-only-until-marriage approach."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siecus.org/_data/global/images/research_says.pdf SIECUS Fact Sheet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616150557/http://www.siecus.org/_data/global/images/research_says.pdf |date=2010-06-16 }} (includes research citations).&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 report by the [[Guttmacher Institute]] pointed out that pregnancy rates for teens 15–19 reversed their decline in 2006, near the peak of the Abstinence Only campaign in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Table 1.0,"U.S. Teenage Pregnancies, Births and Abortions: National and State Trends and Trends by Race and Ethnicity." {{cite web |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2010/01/26/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129204657/http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2010/01/26/index.html |archivedate=2010-01-29 |df= }}, downloaded 20100127.&lt;/ref&gt;

While sex education has been linked to a delay in the first time having sex,&lt;ref name=pmid22999833&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2011.12.028 |pmid=22999833 |laysource=Guttmacher Institute |laysummary=https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2012/sex-education-linked-delay-first-sex |laydate=March 8, 2012 |title=Consequences of Sex Education on Teen and Young Adult Sexual Behaviors and Outcomes |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=332–8 |year=2012 |last1=Lindberg |first1=Laura Duberstein |last2=Maddow-Zimet |first2=Isaac }}&lt;/ref&gt; abstinence-only programs specifically haven't shown this link, and do not seem to influence if or when young people begin having sex.&lt;ref name=pmid18346659&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2007.08.026 |pmid=18346659 |title=Abstinence-Only and Comprehensive Sex Education and the Initiation of Sexual Activity and Teen Pregnancy |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=344–51 |year=2008 |last1=Kohler |first1=Pamela K |last2=Manhart |first2=Lisa E |last3=Lafferty |first3=William E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Support===
Proponents of abstinence-only sex education argue that this approach is superior to comprehensive sex education because it emphasizes the teaching of morality that limits sex to that within the bounds of marriage, and that [[premarital sex|sex before marriage]] and at a [[Child sexuality|young age]] has heavy physical and emotional costs.&lt;ref&gt;PBS, February 4, 2005 [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week823/feature.html Religion &amp; Ethics Newsweekly, Episode 823] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310182953/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week823/feature.html |date=2012-03-10 }} Retrieved on 2007-14-03&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, abstinence programs often teach young people that pleasure in sex is most likely to be found within marriage, and therefore, that they should wait to engage in sexual activity until they are married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14681811.2012.738604 |title=The use and misuse of pleasure in sex education curricula |journal=Sex Education |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=305–18 |year=2013 |last1=Lamb |first1=Sharon |last2=Lustig |first2=Kara |last3=Graling |first3=Kelly }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abstinence generally places a great emphasis on the importance of the institution of marriage, which some proponents believe allows young people to grow and develop as individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Sex Goes To School: Warring Views On Sex - And Sex Education - Since The Sixties|last=Luker|first=Kristin|publisher=W.

Proponents suggest that comprehensive sex education encourages premarital sexual activity among teenagers, which should be discouraged in an era when [[HIV]] and other incurable STIs are widespread and when [[teen pregnancy]] is an ongoing concern. Many supporters of abstinence-only education do so out of the belief that comprehensive guides to sex or information about contraceptives will ultimately result in teens actively pursuing and engaging in sexual activities,&lt;ref name=pmid22022362&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024658 |pmid=22022362 |pmc=3194801 |title=Abstinence-Only Education and Teen Pregnancy Rates: Why We Need Comprehensive Sex Education in the U.S |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=e24658 |year=2011 |last1=Stanger-Hall |first1=Kathrin F |last2=Hall |first2=David W }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others oppose the endorsement of contraception for religious reasons.&lt;ref name="Contra-Contraception"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shorto |first=Russel |title=Contra-Contraception |newspaper=New York Times Magazine |date=May 7, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318073038/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |archivedate=March 18, 2017 |df= }}{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318073038/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |archivedate=2017-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teenagers are framed as less intelligent and less responsible than adults. They are seen as unable to control themselves due to 'raging hormones'. As a result, a teenager's sexual desire is something that needs to be controlled.&lt;ref&gt;Fields, J (2012). "Sexuality Education in the United States: Shared Cultural Ideas across a Political Divide". ''Sociology Compass'': 1–14&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, dividing the teens into two separate categories in the minds of adults: "the innocent and the guilty, the vulnerable and the predatory, the pure and the corrupting."&lt;ref&gt;Fields, p. 6{{full citation needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition ===
Opponents and critics, which include prominent professional associations in the fields of medicine, public health, adolescent health, and psychology, argue that such programs fail to provide adequate information to protect the health of adolescents. Not only is information inadequate, but opponents believe that young people have the right to receive comprehensive information about how to protect themselves and their sexual health.&lt;ref name=pmid16387256&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2005.10.006 |pmid=16387256 |title=Abstinence and abstinence-only education: A review of U.S. Policies and programs |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=72–81 |year=2006 |last1=Santelli |first1=John |last2=Ott |first2=Mary A |last3=Lyon |first3=Maureen |last4=Rogers |first4=Jennifer |last5=Summers |first5=Daniel |last6=Schleifer |first6=Rebecca }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accurate information is especially important since, although some supporters may claim that abstinence is an effective method, it has been found that a small percentage of people actually practice it.&lt;ref name=pmid16387256/&gt;

Some critics also argue that such programs verge on religious interference in secular education. Opponents of abstinence-only education dispute the claim that comprehensive sex education encourages teens to have premarital sex.&lt;ref name="Kirby"&gt;Douglas Kirby, Ph.

Abstinence-only education is not supported by the majority of public school teachers, parents, and students. The majority in each of these groups is opposed to abstinence-only curriculum and wants a more comprehensive curriculum. "Although more than nine in 10 teachers believe that students should be taught about contraception... one in four are instructed not to teach the subject." Even when there are no rules limiting sex education to abstinence-only, teachers may continue to teach abstinence-only curriculum because they fear retaliation from the local community. Parents also want their children to be taught about contraception. "Most parents (65%) believe that sex education should encourage young people to delay sexual activity but also prepare them to use birth control and practice safe sex once they do become sexually active." 86% of parents want schools to teach their children how to get STD testing, 77% want their children to learn how to talk to a partner about STDs and birth control, 71% want them to learn how to use condoms, and 68% want them to learn about using other forms of birth control. Students are also opposed to abstinence-only education. "Approximately half of students in grades 7-12 report needing more information about what to do in the event of rape or sexual assault, how to get tested for HIV and other STDs, and how to talk with a partner about birth control and STDs." Clearly, there is a disparity between the type of sex education curriculum teachers, parents, and students want and what government policy determines they receive.&lt;ref&gt;Dailard, Cynthia.

=== Definition ===
Another problem for abstinence education is the definition of abstinence. Santelli (2006) states that there is no strict definition of abstinence within the US federal government guidelines for teaching abstinence-only sex education, using a mixture of non-specific phrases, like "postponing sex" or "never had [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]]," while also using moralistic terms or phrases like ''[[virgin]]'', ''chaste'', and "making a commitment".&lt;ref name="pmid16387256"/&gt; This has resulted in sexual activities that are not penile-vaginal, including [[mutual masturbation]], [[oral sex]] and [[anal sex]], being considered outside of the scope of abstention from sex, which is termed ''[[technical virginity]].''&lt;ref name="Intimate"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bryan Strong |author2=Christine DeVault |author3=Theodore F. Cohen |title=The Marriage and Family Experience: Intimate Relationship in a Changing Society| publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2010|accessdate=October 8, 2011 |page=186| isbn=0-534-62425-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qjvoSOMB5JMC&amp;pg=PA186|quote=Most people agree that we maintain virginity as long as we refrain from sexual (vaginal) intercourse.

It does so with certain guidelines and restrictions on the recipients. PEPFAR promotes an "ABC" approach – Abstain, Be faithful, and use Condoms. Funding recipients may give information about condoms to youth over 15 years old, but cannot use the funding to provide condoms or promote usage.

PEPFAR was founded in 2003 with the mandate that 33% of its funds provided for prevention be used for abstinence-only education. Since the reauthorization in 2008, this mandate was removed, with a shift toward directives to spend at least 50% on abstinence-only education.&lt;ref name=PEPFARWatch&gt;{{cite web|title=Abstinence &amp; Fidelity |url=http://www.pepfarwatch.org/the_issues/abstinence_and_fidelity/ |publisher=PEPFARWatch |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024090512/http://www.pepfarwatch.org/the_issues/abstinence_and_fidelity/ |archivedate=2014-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of partners has been an area of debate surrounding PEPFAR.

=== Funding ===
In the U.S., states may apply for federal funding of abstinence-only sex education programs from either Title V, the [[Adolescent Family Life Act]] (AFLA), and/or Community-Based Abstinence Education (CBAE).&lt;ref name=pmid22022362/&gt; To be eligible for funding, programs must satisfy requirements given under the Social Security Act, which is reproduced here verbatim:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title05/0510.htm Social Security Act, Section 510] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026183857/http://ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title05/0510.htm |date=2011-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(2) For purposes of this section, the term "abstinence education" means an educational or motivational program which—
:(A) has as its exclusive purpose, teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity;
:(B) teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school age children;
:(C) teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems;
:(D) teaches that a mutually faithful monogamous relationship in context of marriage is the expected standard of human sexual activity;
:(E) teaches that sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects;
:(F) teaches that bearing children out-of-wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child’s parents, and society;
:(G) teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increases vulnerability to sexual advances; and
:(H) teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Funding, which began in the 1980s, has continued to increase since its inception, though support for the programs and legislation surrounding them has become dependent upon the current administration.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10282580.2010.517970 |title=Barack Obama vs Bristol Palin: Why the President's sex education policy wins |journal=Contemporary Justice Review |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=411–24 |year=2010 |last1=Weiser |first1=Dana A |last2=Miller |first2=Monica K }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[George W. Bush administration]] increased federal funding for abstinence-only programs (the only type funded even under the previous [[Clinton Administration]]), while the [[Obama administration]] reversed the emphasis and provided more federal dollars for comprehensive sex education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://secondnexus.com/news/politics/donald-trump-abstinence-only-education-aoum-budget/ Trump Ignores Scientific Evidence Proving Abstinence Only Education Doesn’t Work]&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Donald Trump]] cut grants to comprehensive sex education&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-cuts-short-teen-pregnancy-prevention-program-funding/ Trump administration cuts short teen pregnancy prevention program funding]&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed increased funding for abstinence-only education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thecut.com/2017/05/trump-budget-abstinence-only-sex-ed.html Trump’s Proposed Budget Would Invest $277 Million in Abstinence-Only Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
The [[Christian Right]], who initially stood against having school-based sex education programs, began supporting abstinence-only programs due to the focus on marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/publius/pjr052 |jstor=41682905 |title=Saying No to Abstinence-Only Education: An Analysis of State Decision-Making |journal=Publius: the Journal of Federalism |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=613–35 |year=2012 |last1=Doan |first1=A. E |last2=McFarlane |first2=D. R }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a driving force behind the abstinence movement, they have focused on getting more funding for these programs and have also been successful in creating more awareness surrounding abstinence through their use of activism.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1363460711406460 |title=Battling a 'sex-saturated society': The abstinence movement and the politics of sex education |journal=Sexualities |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=416–43 |year=2011 |last1=Calterone Williams |first1=Jean }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the New Right, the abstinence-only sex education movement was an opportunity and an avenue to change the current view and status of sexuality in America, aligning it more with their own values, and as a result, creating individuals who remained abstinent until marriage, and thus, citizens who embodied values of self-discipline and morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00335630.2016.1209548 |title=Chastity for democracy: Surplus repression and the rhetoric of sex education |journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=353–75 |year=2016 |last1=Kelly |first1=Casey Ryan }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, abstinence-only programs utilize ideas of individualism and personal responsibility when educating young people about sex, seeking to create individuals who take responsibility for sexuality and morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1743923X09000154 |title=Whose Responsibility?

===Religion===
Religious doctrines take varying stances on contraception and pre-marital sex, some of which are covered by:

*[[Religion and birth control]]
*[[Christian views on contraception]]
*[[Protestant views on birth control]]
*[[Catholic teachings on sexual morality]]
*[[Sexuality and Mormonism]]
*[[Fornication]]
*[[Fornication#Islam|Premarital sex in Islam]]

The philosophical [[sex-positive movement]] cuts across many religions, and rejects the idea that consensual pre-marital sex or contraception are immoral.

'''Acoustocerebrography (ACG)''' is a [[medical test]] used to [[medical diagnosis|diagnose]] changes and [[disease|problems]] in the [[brain]] and the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Miroslaw_Wrobel2/publication/286218812_Computer_Aided_Multispectral_Ultrasound_Diagnostics_Brain_Health_Monitoring_System_based_on_Acoustocerebrography/links/5666d42508ae4931cd629ac8.pdf?inViewer=0&amp;pdfJsDownload=0&amp;origin=publication_detail Computer Aided Multispectral Ultrasound Diagnostics Brain Health Monitoring System based on Acoustocerebrography], Bogdan et al. (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; It allows for the noninvasive examination of the brain's [[cell (biology)|cellular]] and [[molecule|molecular]] structure. It can also be applied as a means to diagnose and monitor [[intracranial pressure]], for example as incorporated into continuous brain [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] devices. ACG uses molecular [[acoustics]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783642491412 Molekularakustik - Eine Einführung in die Zusammenhänge zwischen Ultraschall und Molekülstruktur in Flüssigkeiten und Gasen], Werner Schaaffs (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; in audible and [[ultrasound]] frequency ranges, to monitor changes. It may use [[microphone]]s, [[accelerometer]]s, and multifrequency [[ultrasonic transducer]]s. It does not use any [[radiation]] and is completely free of any side effects. ACG also facilitates [[blood flow]] analysis as well as the detection of obstructions in cerebral blood flow (from cerebral [[embolism]]) or bleeding (from [[cerebral hemorrhage]]).

==Passive and active acoustocerebrography==
===Passive acoustocerebrography===
All brain tissue is influenced by blood circulating in the brain's vascular system. With each heartbeat, blood circulates in the skull, following a recurring pattern according to the oscillation produced. This oscillation's effect, in turn, depends on the brain's size, form, structure and its vascular system. Thus, every heartbeat stimulates minuscule motion in the brain tissue as well as [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and therefore produces minimal changes in intracranial pressure. These changes can be monitored and measured in the skull.
Today, mostly passive sensors like accelerometers are used to identify these signals correctly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12028-015-0118-9 Cranial Accelerometry Can Detect Cerebral Vasospasm Caused by Subarachnoid Hemorrhage], Smith et al. (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes highly sensitive microphones are utilized.
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3070164 Recording and processing aneurysmal vibration signals in dogs], Sun et al. (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/21/8/1215.long Acoustic recordings from experimental saccular aneurysms in dogs], Sekhar et al. (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4122509&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D4122509 Detection and Analysis of Cranial Bruit], Kosugi et al. (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

With a digital signal, it becomes possible to study the patterns of the blood flow moving inside the skull. These patterns form unique signatures that can be analyzed with specially designed algorithms, identifying them either as an inconspicuous, “normal” pattern or as a pattern showing an “abnormal” behavior.

===Active acoustocerebrography===
In active ACG applications, a multi-frequency ultrasonic signal is used to detect and classify adverse changes at the cellular or molecular level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0208521615000753 On ultrasound classification of stroke risk factors from randomly chosen respondents using non-invasive multispectral ultrasonic brain measurements and adaptive profiles], Wrobel et al. (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to all of the advantages that passive ACG provides, with active ACG it is possible to conduct a [[Spectrum#Spectrogram|spectral analysis]] of the acoustic signals received. These spectrum analyses not only display changes in the brain's vascular system, but also those in its cellular and molecular structures.
One common application of active ACG is the [[Transcranial Doppler]] test. More recently, its color version (TCCD) has been deployed. These ultrasonic procedures measure blood flow velocity within the brain's blood vessels. They are used to diagnose [[embolisms]], [[stenosis|stenoses]] and vascular constrictions, for example, in the aftermath of a [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]].

==Fields of application==
In contrast with applications that provide only momentary images, such as [[MRI]] and [[CT scan|CT]], the results of ACG procedures can be obtained continuously, thus facilitating effortless and non-invasive real-time monitoring. This can be especially helpful during the acute phase directly after a stroke or a traumatic brain injury. The measured data is mathematically processed continuously and displayed on a monitoring device. The computer-aided analysis of the signals enables the physician/nursing staff to precisely interpret the results immediately after device setup. Furthermore, ACG allows for preventive detection of pathological changes in brain tissue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1942">The '''Belgrade Competition in Oratory''' is an annual academic event at the [[University of Belgrade]]'s [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Law School]], which has gained significant popularity of the general public all over [[Serbia]]. In this competition students deliver their speeches on both free-choice and given topics. The event represents an opportunity for students to express their critical opinions in front of government officials sitting in the front rows of the audience, when the largest lecture hall at the [[law school]] is filled to capacity. The competition is broadcast live on the national television program.

This event is traditionally organized by university professors [[Obrad Stanojević]] and [[Sima Avramović]], the founders of the Center for Oratory ''Institutio oratoria'', which gathers the University of Belgrade's Law School students interested in developing [[public speaking]] skills and prepares them for competitions. These scholars hold an optional course on [[rhetoric]] at the Law School and both are authors of textbooks on rhetoric.

Following the example of the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Belgrade Law School]], several educational institutions in the region organize their own similar events. The winners of local competitions throughout Serbia take part in the Serbian universities wide finals.

The '''Berlin Mathematical School''' ('''BMS''') is a joint [[graduate school]] of the three renowned [[mathematics]] departments of the [[public university|public]]  research universities in [[Berlin]]: [[FU Berlin|''Freie Universität Berlin'']], [[Humboldt Universität|''Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin'']], and [[Berlin Institute of Technology|''Technische Universität Berlin'']].
In October 2006, the BMS was awarded one of the 18 prestigious graduate school awards by the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative|Excellence Initiative]]  of the German Federal Government for its innovative concept, its strong cross-disciplinary focus, and its outstanding teaching schedule tailored to the needs of students in an international environment. This was reconfirmed in June 2012 when the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]] announced that the BMS would also receive funding for a second period until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/list/projectdetails/index.jsp?id=24061210&amp;sort=nr_asc&amp;prg=GSC Retrieved 2015-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt;
The BMS Chair is [[Günter M. Ziegler]] (FU), and the deputy Chairs are [http://didaktik.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/index.php?article_id=15&amp;clang=0 Jürg Kramer] (HU) and [[John M. Sullivan (mathematician)|John M. Sullivan]] (TU).

== Cooperation ==

BMS students enjoy access to exclusive seminars, workshops and lectures in English not only at the participating universities, but also at their academic partners:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math-berlin.de/about-bms/people-a-organization/units&lt;/ref&gt;

• the Research Training Groups (RTG)

• the International Max Planck Research Schools (IMPRS)

• ECMath

• the Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB)

• the Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics (WIAS)

or the DFG Collaborative Research Centers:

• Space – Time – Matter (SFB 647)

• Discretization in Geometry (SFB 109)

• Scaling Cascades in Complex Systems (SFB 1114).

== PhD in Mathematics at the BMS ==

The BMS PhD study program guides a student with a bachelor's degree through a structured course program, an oral qualifying exam, then directly to a doctoral degree in four to five years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math-berlin.de/students/program-information&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math-berlin.de/students/timeline-of-phd&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase I is the first part of the program and includes a lecture program created specifically for the BMS and coordinated among the three universities. Applicants who hold a bachelor's degree, ''Vordiplom'', or equivalent can apply for Phase I of the BMS. Each semester, seven to ten Basic Courses are offered in English. During Phase I, every BMS student should complete at least five Basic Courses, plus two Advanced Courses (including one seminar) within three to four semesters. At the end of Phase I the Qualifying Exam takes place: an oral exam which is mandatory for admission to the research phase. Phase I students have a BMS faculty member as a mentor, who is assigned by the Admissions Committee. The Phase I mentor guides the student for the entire duration of Phase I, through the BMS Qualifying Exam until the start of Phase II.

Phase II is the research phase of the BMS PhD program and, to apply, students are expected to have a master's degree and meet the regular admission requirements of the Berlin universities' PhD programs. Each student is registered as a PhD student at one of the three universities and are expected to finish Phase II within four to six semesters.  Phase II students have a thesis supervisor who provides support in all aspects of the PhD thesis, and gives advice on choosing the right conferences and publishing articles. In addition, Phase II students also have a separate mentor who can assist them in forming a career plan and in establishing a professional network.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math-berlin.de/index.php/students/mentoring&lt;/ref&gt;

== BMS Fridays ==

The BMS Friday is a colloquium which takes place  fortnightly at the BMS Loft in the Urania in Berlin during the lecture period. The BMS welcomes and invites scholars in mathematics. &lt;br /&gt;BMS Fridays also include "What is...?"-seminars&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/w/Math/WhatIsSeminar&lt;/ref&gt; organised by students and offers "tea and cookies" before each talk.

A '''bestiary''', or '''''bestiarum vocabulum''''', is a [[compendium]] of beasts. Originating in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]], bestiaries were made popular in the [[Middle Ages]] in illustrated volumes that described various animals and even rocks. The [[natural history]] and illustration of each beast was usually accompanied by a moral lesson. This reflected the belief that the world itself was the Word of God, and that every living thing had its own special meaning. For example, the [[pelican]], which was believed to tear open its breast to bring its young to life with its own blood, was a living representation of [[Jesus]]. The bestiary, then, is also a reference to the [[symbol]]ic language of [[animals in Christian art|animals in Western Christian art]] and literature.

==History==
The earliest bestiary in the form in which it was later popularized was an anonymous 2nd century [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] volume called the ''[[Physiologus]]'', which itself summarized ancient knowledge and wisdom about animals in the writings of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] authors such as [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[History of Animals|Historia Animalium]]'' and various works by [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Solinus]], [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] and other naturalists.

Following the ''Physiologus'', Saint [[Isidore of Seville]] (Book XII of the ''[[Etymologiae]]'') and [[Saint Ambrose]] expanded the religious message with reference to passages from the [[Bible]] and the [[Septuagint]]. They and other authors freely expanded or modified pre-existing models, constantly refining the moral content without interest or access to much more detail regarding the factual content. Nevertheless, the often fanciful accounts of these beasts were widely read and generally believed to be true. A few observations found in bestiaries, such as the [[Bird migration|migration]] of birds, were discounted by the natural philosophers of later centuries, only to be rediscovered in the modern scientific era.

Medieval bestiaries are remarkably similar in sequence of the animals of which they treat. Bestiaries were particularly popular in [[England]] and [[France]] around the 12th century and were mainly compilations of earlier texts. The [[Aberdeen Bestiary]] is one of the best known of over 50 manuscript bestiaries surviving today.

Bestiaries influenced early [[heraldry]] in the Middle Ages, giving ideas for [[charge (heraldry)|charges]] and also for the artistic form. Bestiaries continue to give inspiration to coats of arms created in our time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Stephen|editor-last=Friar|title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry|location=London|year=1987|publisher=[[A &amp; C Black|Alphabooks/A&amp;C Black]]|isbn=0 906670 44 6|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two illuminated [[Psalter]]s, the [[Queen Mary Psalter]] ([[British Library]] Ms. Royal 2B, vii) and the [[Isabella Psalter]] (State Library, [[Munich]]), contain full Bestiary cycles. The bestiary in the Queen Mary Psalter is found in the "marginal" decorations that occupy about the bottom quarter of the page, and are unusually extensive and coherent in this work. In fact the bestiary has been expanded beyond the source in the Norman bestiary of Guillaume le Clerc to ninety animals. Some are placed in the text to make correspondences with the [[psalm]] they are illustrating.&lt;ref&gt;The Queen Mary psalter: a study of affect and audience By Anne Rudloff Stanton, p44ff, Diane Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] also made his own bestiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Selections from the Bestiary of Leonardo da Vinci | first1=Oliver |last1=Evans |journal=The Journal of American Folklore |volume=64 |number=254 |date=Oct–Dec 1951 |pages=393–396 |jstor=537007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''volucrary'' is a similar collection of the symbols of birds that is sometimes found in conjunction with bestiaries. The most widely known volucrary in the Renaissance was [[Johannes de Cuba]]'s ''Gart der Gesundheit''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Cuba|first1=Jean|title=Garden Of Health|date=1501|publisher=Verard Antoine (Paris)|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b2100150b|archiveurl=http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb386198123|archivedate=2007|language=French|format=758 scanned pages with black &amp; white illustrations}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes 122 birds and which was printed in 1485.&lt;ref&gt;''Hortus sanitatis deutsch.'' Mainz (Peter Schöffer) 1485; Neudrucke München 1924 and 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bestiary content==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
Medieval bestiaries often contained detailed descriptions and illustrations of species native to Western Europe, exotic animals and what in modern times are considered to be imaginary animals. Descriptions of the animals included the physical characteristics associated with the creature, although these were often physiologically incorrect, along with the Christian morals that the animal represented. The description was then normally followed with an artistic illustration of the animal as described in the bestiary.

Bestiaries were organized in different ways based upon the text. The descriptions could be organized by animal groupings, such as terrestrial and marine creatures, or presented in an alphabetical manner. However, the texts gave no distinction between existing and imaginary animals. Descriptions of creatures such as [[dragon]]s, [[unicorn]]s, [[basilisk]], [[griffin]] and [[caladrius]] were common in such works and found intermingled amongst accounts of bears, boars, deer, lions, and elephants.

This lack of separation has often been associated with the assumption that people during this time believed in what the modern period classifies as nonexistent or "[[imaginary creatures]]". However, this assumption is currently under debate, with various explanations being offered.

Some scholars, such as Pamela Gravestock, have written on the theory that medieval people did not actually think such creatures existed but instead focused on the belief in the importance of the Christian morals these creatures represented, and that the importance of the moral did not change regardless if the animal existed or not.

The contents of medieval bestiaries were often obtained and created from combining older textual sources and accounts of animals, such as the ''[[Physiologus]]'', with newer observations and writings. In this way, the content of such written works was constantly added to and built upon.

==Modern bestiaries==
In modern times, artists such as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Saul Steinberg]] have produced their own bestiaries. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] wrote a contemporary bestiary of sorts, the ''[[Book of Imaginary Beings]]'', which collects imaginary beasts from bestiaries and fiction. Nicholas Christopher wrote a literary novel called "The Bestiary" (Dial, 2007) that describes a lonely young man's efforts to track down the world's most complete bestiary. [[John Henry Fleming]]'s ''Fearsome Creatures of Florida''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fearsomecreatures.com |title=Fearsome Creatures of Florida by John Henry Fleming |website=Fearsomecreatures.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Pocol Press, 2009) borrows from the medieval bestiary tradition to impart moral lessons about the environment. [[Caspar Henderson]]'s The Book of Barely Imagined Beings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barelyimaginedbeings.com |title=The Book of Barely Imagined Beings |website=Barelyimaginedbeings.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Granta]] 2012, [[Chicago University Press]] 2013), subtitled "A 21st Century Bestiary," explores how humans imagine animals in a time of rapid environmental change. In July 2014, Jonathan Scott wrote The Blessed Book of Beasts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rna.org/news/184377/Beasts-from-the-East.htm |title=Religion News Association &amp; Foundation |website=Rna.org |date=2016-11-21 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Christian Publications, featuring 101 animals from the various translations of the Bible, in keeping with the tradition of the bestiary found in the writings of the Saints, including Saint John Chrysostom.

'''Brinelling''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɪ|n|ə|l|ɪ|ŋ}} is the permanent [[indentation hardness|indentation]] of a hard surface. It is named after the [[Brinell scale]] of [[hardness]], in which a small ball is pushed against a hard surface at a preset level of force, and the depth and diameter of the mark indicates the Brinell hardness of the surface. Brinelling is a process of wear in which similar marks are pressed into the surface of a moving part, such as bearings or hydraulic pistons. The brinelling is usually undesirable, as the parts often mate with other parts in very close proximity. The very small indentations can quickly lead to improper operation, like chattering or excess vibration, which in turn can accelerate other forms of [[wear]], such as [[spalling]] and [[galling]].

==Introduction==
Brinelling is a material surface failure caused by [[Hertz contact stress]] that exceeds the material limit. It usually occurs in situations where a significant load force is distributed over a relatively small surface area. Brinelling typically results from a heavy or repeated impact load, either while stopped or during rotation, though it can also be caused by just one application of a force greater than the material limit. 

Brinelling can be caused by a heavy load resting on a stationary bearing for an extended length of time. The result is a permanent dent or "brinell mark". The brinell marks will often appear in evenly spaced patterns along the bearing [[race (bearing)|races]], resembling the primary elements of the bearing, such as rows of indented lines for [[needle bearing|needle]] or roller bearings or rounded indentations in [[ball bearing]]s. It is a common cause of [[Bearing (mechanical)|roller bearing]] failures, and loss of [[preload (engineering)|preload]] in [[bolted joint]]s when a hardened washer is not used.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;''Advanced Concepts of Bearing Technology'' By Tedric A. Harris, Michael N. Kotzalas -- CRC Press 2007 Page 284&lt;/ref&gt; For example, brinelling occurs in [[caster]]s when the ball bearings within the swivel head produce grooves in the hard cap, thus degrading performance by increasing the required swivel force.

==Avoiding brinelling damage==
Engineers can use the [[Brinell hardness]] of materials in their calculations to avoid this mode of failure. A rolling element bearing's static load rating is defined to avoid this failure type. Increasing the number of elements can provide better distribution of the load, so bearings intended for a large load may have many balls, or use needles instead. This decreases the chances of brinelling, but increases friction and other factors. However, although roller and ball bearings work well for radial and thrust loading, they are often prone to brinelling when very high impact loading, lateral loading, or vibration are experienced. [[Babbitt bearing]]s or [[bronze]] [[bushing (bearing)|bushing]]s are often used instead of roller bearings in applications where such loads exist, such as in automotive [[crankshaft]]s or pulley [[sheave]]s, to decrease the possibility of brinelling by distributing the force over a very large surface area.

A common cause of brinelling is the use of improper installation procedures. Brinelling often occurs when [[arbor press|pressing]] bearings into holes or onto shafts. Care must usually be taken to ensure that pressure is applied to the proper bearing race to avoid transferring the pressure from one race to the other through the balls or rollers. If pressing force is applied to the wrong race, brinelling can occur to either or both of the races. The act of pressing or clamping can also leave brinell marks, especially if the [[vise]] or press has serrated jaws or roughened surfaces. Flat pressing plates are often used in the pressing of bearings, while soft copper, brass, or aluminum jaw covers are often used in vises to help avoid brinell marks from being forced into the workpiece.&lt;ref&gt;''Automotive Service: Inspection, Maintenance and Repair'' by Tim Gilles -- Delmar Learning 2004 Page 1016&lt;/ref&gt;

==False brinelling==
A similar-looking kind of damage is called [[false brinelling]] and is caused by [[fretting wear]]. This occurs when contacting bodies vibrate against each other in the presence of very small loads, which pushes lubricant out of the contact surface area, and the bearing assembly cannot move far enough to redistribute the displaced lubricant.  The result is a finely polished surface that resembles a brinell mark, but has not permanently deformed either contacting surface. This type of false brinelling usually occurs in bearings during transportation, between the time of manufacture and installation. The polished surfaces are often mistaken for brinelling, although no actual damage to the bearing exists. The false brinelling will disappear after a short break-in period of operation.&lt;ref name=Harris /&gt;

Fretting wear can also occur during operation, causing deeper indentations. This occurs when small vibrations form in the rotating shaft and become harmonically in sync with the speed of rotation, causing circular oscillations in the shaft. The oscillation causes the shaft to move in [[precession (mechanical)|precession]], and the timing of the rotation speed causes the balls or rollers to contact the races only when they are in similar positions. This forms wear marks caused by contact with the bearings and the races in specific areas, but not in others, leaving an uneven wear-pattern that resembles brinelling. However, the marks are usually too wide and do not exactly match the shape of the bearing, and therefore this type of wear can be differentiated from true brinelling.&lt;ref name=Harris /&gt;

The '''Camphill Movement''' is an initiative for social change based on the principles of [[anthroposophy]]. Camphill [[Intentional community|communities]] are residential communities and schools that provide support for the education, employment, and daily lives of adults and children with [[developmental disabilities]], mental health problems, or other special needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/2013-10-05/news/42721660_1_camphill-soltane-disabilities-communities At Camphill Kimberton, crafting a different way to live - Pilly.com 2013-10-05]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are over 100 Camphill communities in more than 20 countries across [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Southern Africa]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://camphill.net/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310010325/http://camphill.net/# |archive-date=2015-03-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
The movement was founded in 1939 at Kirkton House near [[Aberdeen]] by a group that included [[Austria]]n [[paediatrician]] [[Karl König]].&lt;ref&gt;Robin Jackson, The role of [[social pedagogy]] in the training of residential child care workers, ''Journal of Intellectual Disabilities'', 2006 Vol. 10, No. 1, 61-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Holistic Special Education: Camphill Principles and Practice''. 2006, Floris Books, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; It was König's view that every human being possessed a healthy inner personality that was independent of their physical characteristics, including characteristics marking developmental or mental disability, and the role of the school was to recognize, nurture and educate this essential self.&lt;ref name="MH"/&gt; The communities' philosophy, [[anthroposophy]], states that "a perfectly formed spirit and destiny belong to each human being."&lt;ref name="BPR"&gt;Busalle, Rebecca, Cornelius Pietzner, and Stephan Rasch. "The life of the soul". ''Aperture'', Summer 1996 n144: 26(10).&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying principles of König's Camphill school were derived from concepts of education and social life outlined decades earlier by [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophist]] [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861–1925).&lt;ref name="MH"&gt;Marga Hogenboom,''Living With Genetic Syndromes Associated With Mental Disability'', Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are over 100 communities worldwide, in more than 20 countries, mainly in Europe, but also in North America and Southern Africa.&lt;ref name="BPR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd Saunders, ''Ecology and Community Design: Lessons from Northern European Ecological Communities'', Alternatives Journal, Vol 22, Apr/May 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://camphill.net/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310010325/http://camphill.net/# |archive-date=2015-03-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Camphill Movement takes its name from Camphill Estate in the [[Milltimber]] area of [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]], where the Camphill pioneers moved to with their first community for [[Special education in the United Kingdom|children with special needs]] in June 1940. Camphill Estate is now{{when|date=September 2013}} a campus of Camphill School Aberdeen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071114201243/http://www.prpartnership.co.uk/home/default_press.asp?pageid=247 Report Demonstrates Standards of Excellence at Aberdeen Special Needs School], press release, 12 September 2007.

One study suggested that childhood gender nonconformity is [[heritable]].&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008"/&gt;

==Manifestations==
''[[Gender nonconformity]]'' in children can have many forms, reflecting various ways in which a child relates to their gender. In literature, ''[[gender variance]]'' and ''gender atypicality'' are used synonymously with ''gender nonconformity''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adelson L.|first=Stewart|year=2012|title=Practice Parameter on Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual Orientation, Gender Nonconformity, and Gender Discordance in Children and Adolescents|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089085671200500X|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=51| issue = 9|pages=957–974|via=ScienceDirect|doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2012.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and developmental theories of gender==

The concept of childhood [[gender]] nonconformity assumes that there is a correct way to be a girl or a boy.  There are a number of social and developmental perspectives that explore how children come to identify with a particular gender and engage in activities that are associated with this [[gender role]].

Psychoanalytic theories of gender emphasize that children begin to identify with the parent, and that girls tend to identify with their mothers and boys with their fathers. The identification is often associated with the child's realization that they do not share the same [[sex organ|genitals]] with both parents.  According to [[Freud]]’s theories, this discovery leads to [[penis envy]] in girls and [[castration anxiety]] in boys. Although there is not much [[empirical research|empirical evidence]] to back up Freud, his theories sparked new conversations surrounding [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and gender. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Social learning theory emphasizes the rewards and punishments that children receive for sex appropriate or inappropriate behaviors.  One of the criticisms of [[social learning theory]] is that it assumes that children are passive, rather than active participants in their [[social environment]].

Cognitive development theory argues that children are active in defining gender and behaving in ways that reflect their perceptions of [[gender role]]s.  Children are in search of regularities and consistencies in their environment, and the pursuit of [[cognitive dissonance|cognitive consistency]] motivates children to behave in ways that are congruent with the [[social constructionism|societal constructions]] of gender.

Gender schema theory is a hybrid model that combines social learning and [[cognitive development]] theories.  [[Daryl J. Bem]] argues that children have a cognitive readiness to learn about themselves and their surroundings.  They build [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]s to help them navigate their social world, and these schemas form a larger network of associations and beliefs about gender and gender roles.&lt;ref name="Bem 1996 320–335"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bem|first=D.J.|title=Exotic Becomes Erotic: A Developmental Theory of Sexual Orientation|journal=Psychological Review|year=1996|volume=103|pages=320–335|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.2.320|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences of androgens==
===Toy preference studies===
[[File:Young Rhesus Macaque.jpg|thumb|Studies with young [[rhesus macaque]]s suggest that some gender-typical preferences may not only be caused by human socialization.]]
Toys for girls tend to be round and pink, while toys for boy tend to be angular and blue.  The subtle characteristics of toys may differentially appeal to the developing brains of female and male children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jadva|first=V.|title=Infants' preferences for toys, colors and shapes|journal=Arch. Sex. Behav.|year=2010|volume=39|doi=10.1007/s10508-010-9618-z|issue=6|pages=1261–73|pmid=20232129|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In a study of toy preferences of twelve- to 24-month-old infants, males spent more time looking at cars than females and females spent more time looking at dolls than males.  No preference for color was found, and within each sex, both boys and girls preferred dolls to cars at age 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=G.M.|title=An evolutionary perspective of sex-typed toy preferences: pink, blue, and the brain|journal=Arch. Sex. Behav.|year=2003|volume=32|pages=7–14|doi=10.1023/A:1021833110722|pmid=12597267|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines 2010 448"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hines|first=M.|title=Sex-related variation in human behavior and the brain|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|year=2010|volume=14|issue=10|pages=448–56|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.07.005|pmid=20724210|pmc=2951011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of preschool-aged children found that the cultural labeling of toys as "gender-appropriate" impacted toy preferences. In partial contrast to this view, certain animal studies have lent support for [[biological determinism|biologically determined]] gendered toy preferences.  In a study of juvenile [[rhesus macaque|rhesus monkeys]], when given the option between plush or wheeled toys, female monkeys gravitated toward both toys, while male monkeys mainly preferred toys with wheels.  These findings suggest that gendered preferences for toys can occur without the complex [[socialization]] processes that we find in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hassett|first=Janice M.|author2=Siebert, Erin R.|author3=Wallen, Kim.|title=Differences in Rhesus Monkey Toy Preferences Parallel those of Children|journal=Hormones and Behavior|year=2008|volume=54|issue=3|pages=359–64|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2008.03.008|pmid=18452921|pmc=2583786}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Female rhesus monkeys also tend to engage in more nurturing play activities, while males tend to engage in more rough-and-tumble play. However, the co-author of the study warned about overinterpreting the results, stating "The plush and wheeled categories served as proxies for feminine and masculine, but other toy characteristics, such as size or colour, might explain the male's behaviour, or the male monkeys might seek out more physically active toys."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13596-male-monkeys-prefer-boys-toys/|title=Male monkeys prefer boys’ toys|work=New Scientist|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Girls with [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH) have atypically high blood concentrations of [[testosterone]].  In studies of toy preference, these girls show increased interest in male-typical toys, like trucks and balls.  Overall, their play habits and preferences more closely resembled male-typical play than female-typical play.  Even with children exposed a normal range of prenatal androgens, increased testosterone was associated with increased preference for male-typical toys, and decreased prenatal testosterone was associated with greater interest in female-typical toys.

Overall, the degree of androgen exposure during prenatal and postnatal development may bias males and females toward specific [[cognition|cognitive processes]], which are further reinforced through processes of [[socialization]]. The male interest in balls and wheeled toys may relate to the androgenised brains preference for objects that move through space.  The higher levels of androgens in the developing male brain could elicit greater attraction to cars and balls, while lower levels of androgens elicit a preference for dolls and nurturing activities in the female brain.&lt;ref name="Hines 2010 448"/&gt;

[[Cordelia Fine|Dr. Cordelia Fine]] criticizes toy-preference studies in non-human primates. She explains the disparity across research and the labeling of toys, with the rhesus monkey study deeming stuffed animals as inherently feminine, all the while a study with [[vervet monkeys]] shows males displaying a preference for stuffed dogs. Moreover, the effects of hormonal treatment are deemed inconclusive and significant long-term effects on rhesus monkeys being nonexistent, with treated prenatal females showing no increase in aggression and still adopting "feminine" social roles into adulthood.&lt;ref name="Fine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fine|first=Cordelia|title=Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference|year=2010|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=0-393-06838-2|pages=338|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2ZtdAx83yMC&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Fine presents the argument of correlation being confused for causality; are females with CAH interested in typically masculine activities due to their having an innate quality or is this a result of their association with boys and men as a gender? If a visual and spatial value is deemed as a preeminent element in typically masculine toys (such as trucks), females with CAH and males in studies should consequently show a much higher interest for neutral toys such as puzzles and sketchpads (as opposed to non-CAH females), something which they do not.&lt;ref name="Fine"/&gt;

===Playmate and play-style preferences===

Children's preference for same-sex play mates is a robust finding that has been observed in many human cultures and across a number of animal species.   Preference for same-sex playmates is at least partially linked to [[socialization]] processes, but children may also gravitate toward peers with similar play styles. Girls generally engage in more nurturing-and-mothering-type behaviors, while boys show greater instances of rough-and-tumble play.&lt;ref name="Hines 1994 1042–53"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hines|first=M. |author2=Kaufman, Melissa |author3=Francine, R.|title=Androgen and the Development of Human Sex-Typical Behavior: Rough and Tumble Play and Sex of Preferred Playmates in Children with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)|journal=Child Development|year=1994|volume=65|issue=4|pages=1042–53|doi=10.2307/1131303|pmid=7956464}}&lt;/ref&gt; For much of human history, people lived in small [[hunter-gatherer]] societies.  Over time [[evolution]]ary forces may have selected for children’s play activities related to adult survival skills.

However, it is not uncommon for girls and boys to prefer opposite-sex playmates and to engage in gender atypical play styles.  Similarly to toy preferences, androgens may also be involved in playmate and play style preferences.  Girls who have [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH) typically engage in more rough-and-tumble play. Hines and Kaufman (1994) found that 50% of girls with CAH reported a preference for boys as playmates, while less than 10% of their non-CAH sisters preferred boys as playmates.&lt;ref name="Hines 1994 1042–53"/&gt; Another study found that girls with CAH still preferred same-sex playmates, but their atypical play styles resulted in them spending more time alone engaging in their preferred activities. Girls with CAH are more likely to have [[intersex|masculinized genitalia]], and it has been suggested that this could lead parents to treat them more like boys; however, this claim is unsubstantiated by parental reports.&lt;ref name="Hines 2004 75–81"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hines|first=M.|author2=Brook, C.|author3=Conway, G.S.|title=Androgen and Psychosexual Development: Core Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, and Recalled Childhood Gender Role Behavior in Women and Men with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)|journal=Journal of Sex Research|year=2004|volume=41|issue=1|pages=75–81|doi=10.1080/00224490409552215|pmid=15216426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adult traits===

There have been a number of studies correlating childhood gender nonconformity (CGN) and [[sexual orientation]]; however, the relationship between CGN and [[trait theory|personality traits]] in adulthood has been largely overlooked.  Lippa measured CGN, gender-related occupational preferences, self-ascribed [[masculinity]]-[[femininity]] and anxiety in [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] women and men through self-report measures. Gay men showed a tendency toward more feminine self-concepts than heterosexual men.  Similarly, lesbian women reported "higher self-ascribed masculinity, more masculine occupational preferences, and more CGN than heterosexual women." Lippa's study found stronger correlations in CGN and adult personality trait in men than in women. Overall, Lippa's study suggests that gender nonconforming behaviors are relatively stable across a person a life-time.&lt;ref name="Lippa 2008 684–93"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lippa|first=Richard|title=The Relation between Childhood Gender Nonconformity and Adult Masculinity–Femininity and Anxiety in Heterosexual and Homosexual Men and Women|journal=Sex Roles|year=2008|volume=59|issue=9–10|pages=684–93|doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9476-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the advantages of Lippa's study is the relatively high sample size of 950 participants, that was diverse both in terms of representations of sexual orientation and [[ethnic group|ethnicity]]. Although there may be a tendency to want to generalize these findings to all heterosexual and homosexual men and women, awareness that a tendency toward certain behaviors does not mean that they are a monolithic group is necessary; for some individuals, sexual orientation may be the only thing they have in common.&lt;ref name="Lippa 2008 684–93"/&gt;

===Measures of anxiety===

CGN is associated with higher levels of psychological distress in gay men than in lesbian women.  The findings were extended to heterosexual men and women, where "CGN [was] associated with psychological distress in heterosexual men but not in heterosexual women."&lt;ref name="Lippa 2008 684–93"/&gt;  In effect, "CGN impacts men more negatively than women, regardless of sexual orientation."&lt;ref name="Lippa 2008 684–93"/&gt; The pattern of results may be derived by from society's greater acceptance of typically masculine behaviors in girls, and discouragement of typically feminine behaviors in boys.&lt;ref name="Lippa 2008 684–93"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skidmore|first=W.C.|author2=Linsenmeier, J.A.W.|author3=Bailey, J.M.|title=Gender Nonconformity and Psychological Distress in Lesbians and Gay Men|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=2006|volume=35|pages=685–97|doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9108-5|issue=6|pmid=17109224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual orientation==

===General===
A great deal of research has been conducted on the relationship between CGN and sexual orientation. Gay men often report being feminine boys, and lesbian women often report being masculine girls. In men, CGN is a strong predictor of sexual orientation in adulthood, but this relationship is not as well understood in women.&lt;ref name="Baumeister"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunne|first=Michael P.|author2=Bailey, J.M.|author3=Kirk, K.M.|author4=Martin, N.G.|title=The Subtlety of Sex-Atypicality|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=2000|volume=29|issue=6|doi=10.1023/A:1002002420159|pages=549–65|pmid=11100262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=J.M.|author2=Zucker, K.J.|title=Childhood Sex-typed Behavior and Sexual Orientation: A Conceptual Analysis and Quantitative Review|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1995|volume=21|pages=43–55|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.31.1.43|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women with CAH reported more male typical play behaviours and showed less heterosexual interest.&lt;ref name="Hines 2004 75–81"/&gt;

The [[Fraternal birth order and male sexual orientation|fraternal birth order effect]] is a well documented phenomenon that predicts that a man's odds of being homosexual increase 33-48% with each older brother that the man has. Research has shown that the mother develops an [[immune system|immune response]] due to blood factor incompatibility with male fetuses. With each male fetus, the mother's immune system responds more strongly to what it perceives as a threat.  The mother’s immune response can disrupt typical prenatal hormones, like testosterone, which have been implicated in both childhood gender nonconformity and adult sexual orientation.

Bem proposes a theory on the relationship between childhood gender non-conformity, which he refers to as the "exotic become erotic."&lt;ref name="Bem 1996 320–335"/&gt; Bem argues that biological factors, such as [[Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation|prenatal hormones]], [[gene]]s and [[neuroanatomy]], predispose children to behave in ways that do not conform to their sex assigned at birth.  Gender nonconforming children will often prefer opposite-sex playmates and activities.  These become alienated from their same-sex peer group.  As children enter [[adolescence]] "the exotic becomes erotic" where dissimilar and unfamiliar same-sex peers produces [[arousal]], and the general arousal become eroticized over time. Bem's theory does not seem to fit female homosexuality.  Perhaps, males who demonstrate gender nonconformity experience more alienation and separation from same-sex peers, because cultural constructions of masculinity are generally more rigid than femininity.&lt;ref name="Bem 1996 320–335"/&gt;

===Biases in retrospective studies===
Although childhood gender nonconformity has been correlated to sexual orientation in adulthood, there may be a [[reporting bias]] that has influenced the results.  Many of the studies on the link between CGN and sexual orientation are conducted [[Retrospective cohort study|retrospectively]], meaning that adults are asked to reflect on their behaviors as children.  Adults will often reinterpret their childhood behaviors in terms of their present conceptualizations of their [[gender identity]] and sexual orientation.  Gay men and lesbian women who endorsed a [[biological determinism|biological perspective]] on gender and sexual orientation tended to report more instances of childhood gender nonconformity and explain these behaviors as early genetic or biological manifestations of their sexual orientation.  Lesbian women who endorse a [[social constructionism|social constructionist]] perspective on gender identity often interpret their childhood GNC as an awareness of [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] norms and rejection of gender roles.  Heterosexual men are more likely to downplay GNC, attributing their behaviors to being sensitive or artistic. Retrospective reinterpretation does not invalidate studies linking GNC and sexual orientation, but awareness of how present conceptualization of gender identity and sexual orientation can affect perceptions of childhood may be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gottschalk|first=Lorene|title=Same-Sex Sexuality and Childhood Gender Non-Conformity: A Spurious Connection|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|year=2003|volume=12|issue=1|pages=35–50|doi=10.1080/0958923032000067808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender dysphoria==
Children with [[gender dysphoria]], also known as gender identity disorder (GID), exhibit the typical gender nonconforming patterns of behaviors, such as a preference for toys, playmates, clothing, and play-styles that are typically associated with the opposite-sex.  Children with GID will sometimes display disgust toward their own genitals or changes that occur in [[puberty]] (e.g. facial hair or [[menstruation]]).&lt;ref name="Langer 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langer|first=Susan J.|author2=Martin, James I.|title=How Dresses Can Make You Mentally Ill: Examining Gender Identity Disorder in Children|journal=Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal|date=February 2004|volume=21|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A diagnosis of GID in children requires evidence of discomfort, confusion, or aversion to the gender roles associated with the child's genetic sex.  Children do not necessarily have to express a desire to be the opposite-sex, but it is still taken in consideration when making a [[diagnosis|diagnoses]].&lt;ref name="Langer 2004"/&gt;

Some advocates have argued that a [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]] diagnosis legitimizes the experiences of these children, making it easier to rally around a medically defined disorder, in order to raise public awareness, and garner funding for future research and therapies.  Diagnoses of [[gender identity disorder in children]] (GIDC) remains controversial, as many argue that the label pathologizes behaviors and cognitions that fall within the normal variation within gender.  The [[Social stigma|stigma]] associated with mental health disorders may do more harm than good.&lt;ref name="Langer 2004"/&gt;

==Parental reactions==
Parents with gender non-conforming children may not know where to turn to express their feelings. Many parents accept their child’s choice but are more concerned for the overall well being of the child. In some cases families are not accepting of their child’s non-conformity, typically lashing out with punishment grounded on [[homophobia]] and [[sexism]]. Regardless of the stance a parent decides to take on gender non-conformity, it will affect the child and the child’s relationship with the family.

Transphobia can occur when gender nonconforming children are met with others who do not understand or accept what they are going through. Dr. Diane Ehrensaft states that, "Transphobia is the anxieties, prejudices, aspersion, aggression, and hatred cast on individuals who do not accept the gender assigned to them at birth but instead play outside that definition of self or perhaps any binary categorizations of gender, possibly to the extent of altering their body."&lt;ref name=Ehrensaft2011&gt;Ehrensaft, Diane, PhD. "Boys Will Be Girls, Girls will Be Boys: Children Affect Parents as Parents Affect Children in Gender Nonconformity." Psychoanalytic Psychology 28.4 (2011): 528-48. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Transphobia can become a serious conflict within the family and can damage the relationship the child has with his or her family.

Parents who recognize that they have gender non-conforming children sometimes experience a feeling of loss, shock, denial, anger, and despair.&lt;ref&gt;Children's National Medical Center. If You Are Concerned About Your Childs Gender Behavior. N.p.: Children's National Medical Center, n.d. Children's National Medical Center. Web. 31 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These feelings typically subside as a parent learns more about gender nonconformity. However, there are families that remain unaccepting of gender nonconformity and correlate it to psychological or social problems. Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Jean Malpas says, "Some react very negatively and the gender nonconformity can become a significant source of conflict between parents and a damaging source of disconnection between parent and child."&lt;ref&gt;Malpas, Jean. "Between Pink and Blue: A Multi-Dimensional Family Approach to Gender Nonconforming Children and Their Families." Family Process 50.4 (2011): 453-470. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Diane Ehrensaft cites that there are three family types that can affect the outcome of a child's gender nonconformity: transformers, transphobics, and transporters.&lt;ref name=Ehrensaft2011/&gt; Transformers: Transformers are parents that are comfortable in supporting their child in their gender variant journey and can easily identify their child as a separate person. Ehrensaft states, "These parents will stand a good chance of overcoming whatever transphobic reactions may reside within them to evolve into parents who both meet their child where he or she is and become an advocate for their gender nonconforming child in the outside world."&lt;ref name=Ehrensaft2011/&gt; Transphobics: Transphobic parents are not comfortable in their own gender, and may not understand that gender is fluid.  Transphobic parents may feel their child is an extension of themselves and respond negatively when their child is faced with his or her own adversity.  Ehrensaft believes these parents deny their child with an excess of negativity and transphobic "reactivity" this allows the child no room for nonconformity and undermines the love the parent claims to have for the child. 'Transporters: Transporters are parents that appear to be completely accepting of their child's gender nonconformity but on the inside have doubts about whether or not it is an authentic conformity. Transporter parents may say things like, "It's just a phase," or "he or she will grow out of it."

== Peer reactions ==
Once children reach school age, girls who are considered "tomboys" and boys who are considered to be more "sensitive" than their gender typical peers, are more likely to face challenges during childhood than their gender-typical counterparts. It is possible that their nonconformity goes unnoticed, however it is more likely that they fall victim to bullying and harassment when they reach school age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haldeman | first1 = Douglas C | year = 2000 | title = Gender atypical youth: Clinical and social issues | url = | journal = School Psychology Review | volume = 29 | issue = 2| page = 192 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study on gender atypical fifteen year olds, atypical males self-report being lonelier, bullied more, less likely to have male friends, and be in "greater distress" than gender-typical males in the same demographic.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Robert, and Helen Sweeting. "Adolescent bullying, relationships, psychological well-being, and gender-atypical behavior: A gender diagnosticity approach." ''Sex Roles'' 50, no. 7-8 (2004): 525-537.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Needs of gender nonconforming children and families==

There is still controversy regarding the best approach for gender nonconforming children, but as gender nonconformity becomes more widely accepted many parents and professionals have identified things that gender variant or gender nonconforming children need to easily adjust to their transformation.&lt;ref name=Riley2013&gt;Reilly, Elizabeth A., Gomathi Sitharthan, Lindy Clemson, and Milton Diamond. "Recognizing the Needs of Gender-variant Children and Their Parents." Sex Education 13.6 (2013): 644-59. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents have suggested that their children need the ability to discuss their gender non-conformity freely with their parent, to be loved throughout their transformation, and to be permitted to make choices regarding their gender on their own. They have also suggested a peer support team and supportive counseling in addition to support from their school and schools administrators and authorities.&lt;ref name=Riley2013/&gt;

Parents must be mindful of a child's need for parent expressions of acceptance and validation. If not validated a child may begin sharing less with their parent and more with friends, this could lead to the parent thinking the gender nonconformity was just a brief phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Menvielle | first1 = Edgardo J. | last2 = Tuerk | first2 = Catherine | year = 2002 | title = A Support Group for Parents of Gender-Nonconforming Boys | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 41 | issue = 8| pages = 1010–013 | doi=10.1097/00004583-200208000-00021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disclosure is also a very important to a family when raising a gender non-conforming child. Parents need to consider whom to talk to about their child and what type of information they decide to share. Other members of the family must also be prepared to make decisions regarding what to say and who to say it to.&lt;ref&gt;"Parent Considerations." Gender Spectrum. Gender Spectrum, n.d. Web. http://www.genderspectrum.org.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Regarding their own needs, parents have suggested that they need information regarding gender nonconforming children that can better assist them and their child in making their transition. Additionally, parents have stated they need increased education on gender nonconforming children, and support from surrounding friends and family to help build parental confidence. Parents have also suggested they need counseling to help provide direction, support from medical professionals and peers, and access to transgender people to help provide them with a positive portrayal of transgender communities.&lt;ref name=Riley2013/&gt;

An article in The Sunday Times, 25 November 2018, by journalist, [[Andrew Gilligan]] reports criticism of Trans Groups for large increases in the number of child referrals to the UK National Health Service specialist service dealing with Transgender children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk|title=Trans groups under fire for huge rise in child referrals|last=Gilligan|first=Andrew|date=25 November 2018|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical treatments for gender dysphoria==
It is important for clinicians to identify children whose gender dysphoria will persist into adolescence and those who outgrow their gender identity disorder (GID) or gender dysphoria diagnosis. In instances where the child’s distress and discomfort continues clinicians will sometimes prescribe [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) to delay puberty.&lt;ref name="Wallien 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallien|first=M.S.C|author2=Cohen-Kettenis, P.T.|title=Psychosexual Outcome of Gender-Dysphoric Children|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|year=2008|doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e31818956b9|volume=47|issue=12|pages=1413–1423}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Identifying stable and persistent cases of GID may reduce the number of surgeries and hormonal interventions individuals undergo in adolescence and adulthood. Gender identity disorders persist into adolescence in about 27% of children with GID diagnoses.&lt;ref name="Wallien 2008"/&gt;

Diagnosis and treatment of GID in children can be distressing for the parents, which can further exacerbate distress in their child.  Parents had difficulties accepting their child's desire to be the opposite sex, and are resistant to children wanting to alter their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hill|first=Darryl B.|author2=Rozanski, C.|author3=Carfagnini, J.|author4=Willoughby, B.|title=Gender Identity Disorders in Childhood and Adolescence|journal=Journal of Psychology &amp; Human Sexuality|year=2006|volume=17|issue=3|pages=7–34|doi=10.1300/J056v17n03_02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supportive professionals===

Some professionals, including Dr. Edgardo J. Menvielle of the Children's National Medical Center, who has specialized in this area in his clinical practice,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrensnational.org/FindADoctor/DoctorProfile.aspx?DoctorId=325&amp;Name=Edgardo%20Menvielle *Edgardo J. Menvielle, MD, MSHS of the Children's National Medical Center]&lt;/ref&gt; believe that the proper response to gender variant behavior is supportive therapy aimed at helping the child deal with any social issues which may arise due to homophobia / transphobia. These professionals believe that attempts to alter these behaviors, and/or whatever mechanism is responsible for their expression, are generally ineffective and do more harm than good. While not universally advocating for what childhood transgender advocates refer to as full social transition, the CNMC model generally supports allowing a child to express cross gendered interests at home in an age appropriate fashion.  Other professionals associated with a supportive model include Dr. [[Norman Spack]] of Children's Hospital Boston,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrenshospital.org/clinicalservices/Site2280/mainpageS2280P4.html Gender Management Service (GeMS) Clinic at Children's Hospital in Boston]&lt;/ref&gt;  Catherine Tuerk, MA, RN, Herbert Schreier, MD (Children's Hospital Oakland), and Ellen C. Perrin, MD of the Center for Children with Special Needs (CCSN) at TUFTS. Rosenburg (2002) recommends a parent-centered approach that helps parents learn to accept and support their child's identity and help the child to work through the issues surrounding identity, without trying to eliminate gender-variant behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=M.|title=Children with gender identity issues and their parents in individual and group treatment|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|year=2002|volume=41|pages=619–21|doi=10.1097/00004583-200205000-00020|pmid=12014795|issue=5|last2=Jellinek|first2=Michael S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reparative therapy===

Other professionals, typified by Dr. [[Kenneth Zucker]], the Head of the Gender Identity Service, Child, Youth, and Family Program and Psychologist-in-Chief at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, believe that behavior modification to extinguish gender variance is the appropriate response to cross gender interests. Dr. Zucker asks the rhetorical question of whether it would be ethical to treat an African American child who wishes to identify as Caucasian with cosmetic surgeries to facilitate this identity, though his critics point out that gender identity is completely non-analogous to ethnic identity. Dr. Zucker's choice as one of the professionals creating the new DSM entry on GID has elicited a firestorm of controversy in the LGBTQ community. Dr. Zucker has expressed the opinion that if his therapies also occasionally prevent a homosexual outcome, they are a valid parental choice.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} He was also criticized for statements suggesting that children with nonnormative gender might be autistic and hyperfocusing on gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Harley |first1=Nicola |title=Children who believe they are transgender 'could have autism', says controversial expert |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/12/children-believe-transgender-could-have-autism-says-controversial/ |website=The Telegraph |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no one universal set of [[behavior modification|behavioral interventions]] designed to reduce stress in children with GID.  Zucker (2000) asserts that childhood gender dysphoria is caused by "tolerating or encouraging cross-gender behaviour or by intentionally raising [[androgyny|androgynous]] children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zucker|first=K.J|title=Gender identity disorder|journal=Handbook of developmental psycholpathology.|year=200|volume=2nd ed.|pages=671–86|doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-4163-9_36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He advises that behavioural treatments should aim to discourage gender-variant behaviours that have inadvertently been reinforced in the past.  In contrast, [[reparative therapy]] for adults is generally discouraged by the ethics guidelines of major U.S. mental health organizations, including the [[American Psychological Association]], [[American Psychiatric Association]], the [[American Counseling Association]]. There is no such consensus around such therapies for children.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The Co-Managed IT security service model entails security monitoring, event correlation, incident response, system tuning, and compliance support across an organization’s entire IT environment. Co-Management allows organizations to collaborate with their service providers by blending security expertise of the provider with the contextual knowledge of the customer to optimize security posture.

Co-Managed security services also allow for organizations’ critical data and tools to be remotely managed by a team of certified engineers and security analysts from a 24/7/365 [[Information_security_operations_center|Security Operations Center (SOC)]]. This service approach allows for customer data to remain in-house while the [[Security_information_and_event_management|SIEM]] platform is either on-site or cloud-hosted. The service provider’s staff works in conjunction with customer security teams to outline the rules of engagement inside the environment to provide monitoring and respond to alerts in real-time. The Security Operation Center also provide the “care and feeding”, and development of a variety of security solutions. The co-managed approach also allows organizations to focus on emerging internal projects and other critical areas of IT.

According to Gartner’s [https://www.gartner.com/doc/3112220/use-comanaged-siem How and When to Use Co-managed Security Information and Event Management report], “Co-managed SIEM services enable security and risk management leaders to maximize value from SIEM and enhance security monitoring capabilities, while retaining control and flexibility.” and "Co-management is on the rise and expected to grow five-fold by 2020."

''SIEM,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/security-information-and-event-management-siem&lt;/ref&gt; IDS/IPS, Compliance Automation, Network Configuration Management Tools, Advanced Threat Intelligence, Network Access Control, Endpoint Threat Detection and Response, Application Security, File Integrity Monitoring, Forensic Investigation, and Vulnerability Scanning and Assessment'', are all examples of cyber security solutions that co-managed service providers support&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eventtracker.com/campaigns/co-managed-siem/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In water treatment, coagulation [[flocculation]] involves the addition of [[polymer]]s that clump the small, destabilized particles together into larger [[Particle aggregation|aggregates]] so that they can be more easily separated from the water. Coagulation is a chemical process that involves neutralization of charge whereas [[flocculation]] is a physical process and does not involve neutralization of charge. The coagulation-flocculation process can be used as a preliminary or intermediary step between other water or wastewater treatment processes like [[filtration]] and [[sedimentation]]. Iron and aluminium salts are the most widely used [[Flocculation|coagulants]] but salts of other metals such as [[titanium]] and [[zirconium]] have been found to be highly effective as well.'''&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Jia-Qian|date=2015-05-01|title=The role of coagulation in water treatment|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221133981500009X|journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering|series=Nanotechnology • Separation engineering|volume=8|pages=36–44|doi=10.1016/j.coche.2015.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chekli|first=L.|last2=Eripret|first2=C.|last3=Park|first3=S.

== Mechanism ==
In a colloidal suspension, particles will settle very slowly or not at all because the colloidal particles carry surface electrical charges that mutually repel each other. A coagulant (typically a metallic salt) with the opposite charge is added to the water to overcome the repulsive charge and "destabilize" the suspension. For example, the colloidal particles are negatively charged and alum is added as a coagulant to create positively charged ions. Once the repulsive charges have been neutralized (since opposite charges attract), the [[van der Waals force]] will cause the particles to cling together (agglomerate) and form micro floc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Determining Coagulant Dose ==

=== Jar Test ===
[[File:Jar Test for Coagulation.jpg|thumb|Jar test for coagulation]]
The dose of the coagulant to be used can be determined via the [[Flocculation|Jar Test.]]&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aragonés-Beltrán|first=P.|last2=Mendoza-Roca|first2=J. A.|last3=Bes-Piá|first3=A.|last4=García-Melón|first4=M.|last5=Parra-Ruiz|first5=E.|date=2009-05-15|title=Application of multicriteria decision analysis to jar-test results for chemicals selection in the physical–chemical treatment of textile wastewater|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389408012004|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=164|issue=1|pages=288–295|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.08.046}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jar test involves exposing same volume samples of the water to be treated to different doses of the coagulant and then simultaneously mixing the samples at a constant rapid mixing time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The microfloc formed after coagulation further undergoes flocculation and is allowed to settle. Then the [[turbidity]] of the samples is measured and the dose with the lowest turbidity can be said to be optimum.

=== Microscale Dewatering Tests ===
Despite its widespread use in the performance of so-called "dewatering experiments", the jar test is limited in its usefulness due to several disadvantages. For example, evaluating the performance of prospective coagulants or flocculants requires both significant volumes of water/wastewater samples (liters) and experimental time (hours). This limits the scope of the experiments which can be conducted, including the addition of replicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luring |first1=M. |last2=Pessoa Noyma |first2=N. |last3=de Magalhaes |first3=L. |last4=Miranda |first4=M. |last5=Mucci |first5=M. |last6=van Oosterhout |first6=F. |last7=Huszar |first7=V.L.M. |last8=Manzi Marinho |first8=M. |title=Critical assessment of chitosan as coagulant to remove cyanobacteria |journal=Harmful Algae |date=June 2017 |volume=66 |pages=1-12 |doi=10.1016/j.hal.2017.04.011 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568988316303535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the analysis of jar test experiments produces results which are often only semi-quantitative. Coupled with the wide range of chemical coagulants and flocculants that exist, it has been remarked that determining the most appropriate dewatering agent as well as the optimal dose "is widely considered to be more of an ‘art’ rather than a ‘science’".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=LaRue |first1=R.J. |last2=Cobbledick |first2=J. |last3=Aubry |first3=N.|last4=Cranston |first4=E.D. |last5=Latulippe |first5=D.R.|title=The microscale flocculation test (MFT)—A high-throughput technique for optimizing separation performance |doi=10.1016/j.cherd.2015.10.045 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263876215004190 |journal=Chemical Engineering Research &amp; Design |date=2016 |volume=105 |pages=85-93}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, dewatering performance tests such as the jar test lend themselves well to miniaturization. For example, the Microscale Flocculation Test developed by LaRue ''et al.'' reduces the scale of conventional jar tests down to the size of a standard multi-well [[microplate]], which yields benefits stemming from the reduced sample volume and increased parallelization; this technique is also amenable to quantitative dewatering metrics, such as [[capillary suction time]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Streaming Current Detector ===
An automated device for determining the coagulant dose is the Streaming Current Detector (SCD). The SCD measures the net surface charge of the particles and shows a [[streaming current]] value of 0 when the charges are neutralized ([[cationic]] coagulants neutralize the [[anionic]] [[colloid]]s). At this value (0), the coagulant dose can be said to be optimum.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
[[File:Jar test for coagulation.webm|thumb|Jar test: Mixing different doses of coagulant with samples of the water to be treated]]

== Limitations ==
Coagulation itself results in the formation of floc but flocculation is required to help the floc further aggregate and settle. The coagulation-flocculation process itself removes only about 60%-70% of [[Organic matter|Natural Organic Matter]] (NOM) and thus, other processes like oxidation, filtration and sedimentation are necessary for complete raw water or wastewater treatment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Coagulant aids (polymers that bridge the colloids together) are also often used to increase the efficiency of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oladoja|first=Nurudeen Abiola|date=2016-06-01|title=Advances in the quest for substitute for synthetic organic polyelectrolytes as coagulant aid in water and wastewater treatment operations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352554116300067|journal=Sustainable Chemistry and Pharmacy|volume=3|pages=47–58|doi=10.1016/j.scp.2016.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cultural artifact''', or '''cultural artefact''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#Miscellaneous spelling differences|American and British English spelling differences]]), is a term used in the [[social sciences]], particularly [[anthropology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4SIXk2bp5u8C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=The+pragmalinguistic+analysis+of+narrative+texts&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title = The pragmalinguistic analysis of narrative texts | author = Richard J. Watts | isbn=978-3-87808-443-3 | year=1981 | publisher=Gunter Narr Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ethnology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;q=warrabarna+kaurna!&amp;btnG=Search+Books | title = Warrabarna Kaurna! | author = Rob Amery}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sociology]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} for anything created by [[human]]s which gives information about the [[culture]] of its creator and users. &lt;!-- the article should be expanded, and this sentence would be a good start, but it just is not clear enough without rewriting or explanation. The artifact may change over time in what it represents, how it appears and how and why it is used as the culture changes over time.--&gt; ''Artifact'' is the spelling in [[North American English]]; ''artefact'' is usually preferred elsewhere.

Cultural artifact is a more generic term and should be considered with two words of similar, but narrower, nuance: it can include objects recovered from [[archaeological site]]s, i.e. [[Artifact (archaeology)|archaeological artifacts]], but can also include objects of modern or early-modern society, or '''social artifacts'''. For example, in an anthropological context: a 17th-century [[lathe]], a piece of [[faience]], or a [[television]] each provides a wealth of information about the time in which they were manufactured and used.

Cultural artifacts, whether ancient or current, have a significance because they offer an insight into: technological processes, economic development and social structure, among other attributes.

The philosopher [[Marx W. Wartofsky]] categorised artifacts as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Wartofsky, Marx W. (1979). Models: Representation and scientific understanding. Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Reidel.&lt;/ref&gt;
* primary artifacts: used in production (such as a hammer, a fork, a lamp or a camera);
* secondary artifacts: relating to primary artifacts (such as a user-manual for a camera);
* tertiary artifacts: representations of secondary artifacts (such as a picture of a user-manual for a camera).

Social artifacts, unlike archaeological artifacts, do not need to have a physical form (for example [[virtual artifact]]), nor to be of historical value (items created seconds ago can be classified as social artifacts).

'''Datacasting''' (data broadcasting) is the [[broadcasting]] of [[data]] over a wide area via [[radio wave]]s.  It most often refers to supplemental [[information]] sent by [[television station]]s along with [[digital terrestrial television]], but may also be applied to [[Digital data|digital]] [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]]s on [[analog TV]] or [[radio]].  It generally does not apply to data which is inherent to the medium, such as [[PSIP]] data which defines [[virtual channel]]s for DTT or [[direct broadcast satellite]] systems; or to things like [[cable modem]] or [[satellite modem]], which use a completely separate channel for data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Datacasting {{!}} Homeland Security|url=https://www.dhs.gov/publication/video-datacasting|website=www.dhs.gov|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Datacasting often provides [[news]], [[weather]], [[traffic]], [[stock market]], and other [[information]] which may or may not relate to the programs it is carried with. It may also be [[interactive]], such as [[Video game|gaming]], [[shopping]], or [[education]]. An [[electronic program guide]] is usually included, although this stretches the definition somewhat, as this is often considered inherent to the digital broadcast standard.

The [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]], [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] and [[ISDB]] standards allow for [[broadband]] datacasting via DTT, though they do not necessarily define how. The [[overscan]] and [[VBI]] are used for analog TV, for moderate and low bandwidths (including [[closed captioning]] in the VBI) respectively. [[DirectBand]] and [[Radio Data System|RDS]]/[[RBDS]] are medium and narrow [[subcarrier]]s used for analog FM radio. The [[EUREKA 147]] and [[HD Radio]] standards both allow for datacasting on [[digital radio]], defining a few basics but also allowing for later expansion.

The term '''IP Datacasting''' (IPDC) is used in [[DVB-H]] for the technical elements required to send [[Internet Protocol|IP]] packets over DVB-H broadband downstream channel combined with a return channel over a mobile communications network such as [[General Packet Radio Service|GPRS]] or [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]]. The set of specifications for IP Datacast (phase1) was approved by the DVB project in October 2005.

==Datacasting services around the world==
===North America===
====Ambient Information Network====
Ambient Information Network, a datacasting network owned by [[Ambient Devices]] presently hosted by U.S.A. Mobility, a U.S. paging service and focuses on information of interest to the local (or larger) area, such as weather and stock indices, and with a paid subscription Ambient will provide a particular device with more personalized information.WITH dish sat

====RBDS====
A slight variation of the European [[Radio Data System]], RBDS is carried on a 57kHz [[subcarrier]] on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[radio station]]s.  While originally intended for [[program-associated data]], it can also be used for datacasting purposes including [[Pager|paging]] and [[dGPS]].

====DirectBand====
[[DirectBand]], owned by [[Microsoft]], uses the 67.65 kHz subcarrier leased from FM radio stations. This subcarrier delivers about 12 kbit/s (net after [[error correction]]) of data per station, for over 100 MB per day per city.  Data includes [[traffic]], sports, weather, stocks, news, movie times, calendar appointments, and local time.

====MovieBeam====
The now-[[wikt:Defunct|defunct]] [[MovieBeam]] service used [[dNTSC]] technology by [[Dotcast]] to transmit [[720p]] [[HDTV]] movies in the lower [[vestigial sideband]] of [[NTSC]] [[analog TV]]. The [[set-top box]] stored the movies to be [[video on demand|viewed on demand]] [[pay-per-view|for a fee]].  This was distributed through [[PBS]]'s [[National Datacast]].

====TV Guide On Screen====
[[TV Guide On Screen]] is an [[advertising]]-supported datacast sent by one local station in each [[media market]].  It supplements or replaces the limited [[electronic program guide]] sent by each [[TV station]], which is already mandated by the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).

====ATSC-M/H====
[[ATSC-M/H]] is yet another [[mobile TV]] standard, although it is transmitted and controlled by the broadcasters instead of a third party, and is therefore mostly [[free-to-air]] (although it can also be [[subscription]]-based). From a technical standpoint, it is an IP-[[encapsulation (networking)|encapsulate]]d datacast of [[MPEG-4]] [[streaming video]], alongside the [[ATSC]] [[MPEG transport stream]] used for [[terrestrial television]] broadcasting. Heavy error correction, separate from that native to ATSC, compensates for ATSC's poor mobile (and often fixed) reception.

====UpdateTV====
[[UpdateTV]] is a service used by some brands of [[TV set]]s and other [[ATSC tuner]]s to [[software update|update]] their [[firmware]] via [[over-the-air programming]].  This is also transmitted on PBS stations via National Datacast.

===Australia===
{{See also|Digital television in Australia}}
Australian broadcast infrastructure company [[Broadcast Australia]] undertook a three-year trial in Sydney of a datacasting service using the [[DVB-T]] system for use in Australia.   

The trial consisted of a number of services on one standard 7MHz [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplex]], collectively known as ''[[Digital Forty Four]]''.

The collection included:

* A combined program guide for the free-to-air broadcasters (Channel 4)
* ABC news, sport, and weather items (Channel 41)
* [[Channel NSW]] ([http://www.nsw.gov.au/channelnsw/ link]) Government and Public Information, including real time traffic information and life surf webcam images (Channel 45)
* [[Australian Christian Channel]] (Channel 46)
* [[Expo (channel)|Expo]] Home Shopping (Channel 49) and 
* Federal parliamentary audio broadcasts.

More recently a near-Australia wide broadcast of a datacasting channel called [[MyTalk]] commenced on April 13, 2007.  Broadcasting as part of the multiplex on [[Southern Cross Television|Southern Cross]] and [[Southern Cross Ten]] stations, it provided news, weather and other information, available free to anyone able to tune in.  The stream consisted of text applicable to the viewer's location and a 4:3 video window of terrestrial TV from the relevant [[Southern Cross Television|Southern Cross]]/[[Southern Cross Ten]] station.

On February 25, 2008, MyTalk ceased broadcasting. Digital Forty Four was shut down at exactly midnight on the night of April 30, 2010.

=== Malaysia ===
Malaysian multi-channel pay-TV operator, [[MiTV Corporation Sdn Bhd]] has launched its IP-over-UHF service in September 2005. The full digital broadcast capacity is being used to deliver IP services which such as multicast streaming and datacasting.

=== South Africa ===
[[Mindset Network]] has developed an IP satellite datacast platform for the distribution of educational and health content to sites around South Africa and increasingly throughout the rest of Africa as well.  he model is a forward and store model allowing users of the platform to view content in an on-demand fashion. Content distributed in this way includes video content, print-based content (in the form of [[PDF]] files), as well as interactive computer-based multimedia content.

Significantly, the model also includes access to a GPRS network that allows the receiving sites to communicate back to the Mindset central server. Communications include statistics about the physical health of the machine (e.g. power status, disk drive usage) as well as usage statistics indicating what content has been viewed.

The model also includes a distributed deployment of the [[Moodle]] LMS, allowing users to take assessments and then have the results transmitted via GPRS to the Mindset server for accreditation.

=== United Kingdom ===

[[Teletext]] was used extensively on analogue channels; a type of datacasting using the [[overscan]] on analogue transmissions. Teletext Limited and Ceefax were the main providers. Within digital terrestrial television, the Digital Teletext name is used extensively although the technology used to provide this service is unrelated and uses the [[MHEG-5]] UK profile.

=== Worldwide ===
====Outernet====
[[Outernet]]'s goal is to provide free access to content from the web through geostationary and Low Earth Orbit satellites, made available effectively to all parts of [[Earth|the world]]. The project uses datacasting and [[User Datagram Protocol]] through both small satellites, such as [[CubeSat]]s, and larger, more conventional [[Geosynchronous satellite|geostationary communications satellite]]s in a [[satellite constellation]] network. [[Wi-Fi]] enabled devices would communicate with the satellite [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspot]]s, which receive data broadcasts from satellites.

== Usage and applications ==
Flame arresters are used:
* to stop the spread of an open fire
* to limit the spread of an explosive event that has occurred
* to protect potentially explosive mixtures from igniting
* to confine fire within an enclosed, controlled, or regulated location
* to stop the propagation of a flame traveling at sub-sonic velocities

They are commonly used on:
* fuel [[storage tank]] vents

A flame arrester (also called a deflagration arrester) functions by absorbing the heat from a flame front traveling at sub-sonic velocities, thus dropping the burning gas/air mixture below its auto-ignition temperature: consequently, the flame cannot survive. The heat is absorbed through channels (passages) designed into an element. These channels are chosen and measured as the mesg ([[Maximum Experimental Safe Gap]]) of the gas for a particular installation.
These passages can be regular, like crimped metal ribbon or [[wire]] [[mesh]] or a [[sheet metal]] plate with [[punch press|punched]] holes, or irregular, such as those in [[Raschig ring|random packing]].&lt;ref name="catox"/&gt;

The required size of the channels needed to stop the flame front can vary significantly, depending on the flammability of the fuel mixture. The large openings on a [[chain link fence]] are capable of slowing the spread of a small, slow-burning [[grass fire]], but fast-burning grass fires will penetrate the fence unless the holes are very small.&lt;ref&gt;''Do Wire Fences Stop Ground Fires?'', JAMES L. MURPHY AND HARRY E. SCHIMKE, U.S. Forest Service Research Note PSW-70, Pacific southwest forest and range experiment station, Berkeley, CA, 1965, http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_rn070/psw_rn070.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[coal mine]] containing highly explosive [[coal dust]] or [[methane]], the wire mesh of a [[Davy lamp]] must be very tightly spaced.

For flame arresters used as a safety device, the mesh must be protected from damage due to being dropped or struck by another object, and the mesh must be capable of rigidly retaining its shape during the propagation of a flame front. Any shifting of the individual wires that make up the mesh can create an opening large enough to allow the flame to penetrate and spread beyond the barrier.

On a fuel storage vent, flame arresters also serve a secondary purpose of allowing air pressure to equalize inside the tank when fuel is added or removed, while also preventing [[insects]] from flying or crawling into the vent piping and fouling the fuel in the tanks and pipes.

==Safety==
Flame arresters should be used only in the gas group and conditions they have been designed and tested for.  Since the depth on an arrester is specified for certain conditions, changes in the temperature, pressure, or composition of the gases entering the arrester can cause the flame spatial velocity to increase, making the design of the arrester insufficient to stop the flame front ("propagation"). The deflagration may continue downstream of the arrester.&lt;ref name="catox"/&gt;

Flame arresters should be periodically inspected to make sure they are free of [[dirt]], [[insect]]s using it as a [[nest]], or [[corrosion]].  The [[U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board]] concluded that an uninspected and badly corroded flame arrester failed to prevent a 2006 explosion at a [[sewage treatment|wastewater treatment plant]]  in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]].&lt;ref name="CSB2"&gt;{{cite journal

The organisation was created in 1989/1990.&lt;ref name=netball-europe&gt;{{harvnb|England Netball|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of August 2015, the English women's national team was ranked number three in the world, Wales is ranked number eight, Scotland is ranked number ten, and Northern Ireland is ranked number twelve.&lt;ref name="International Netball Federation"/&gt; The major netball competition in Europe is the [[Netball Superleague]]&lt;ref name=fiat-netball&gt;{{harvnb|FIAT Netball Superleague}}&lt;/ref&gt; and features nine to ten teams from all areas of Britain.&lt;ref name=fiat-netball/&gt;

In the United Kingdom, netball has traditionally been managed by women.&lt;ref name=White-46&gt;{{harvnb|White|2002|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Netball in England|England]], netball is included as part of the physical education curriculum.&lt;ref name=White-37&gt;{{harvnb|White|2002|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its inclusion had been at times controversial; during the 1910s and 1920s, schools worried about the potential negative impact of physical exercise on the health of girls.&lt;ref name=games-for-girls&gt;{{harvnb|Western Argus|1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Welsh Netball Association]] (Cymdeithas Pêl Rwyd Cymru) was created in 1945.&lt;ref name=ifna-wales&gt;{{harvnb|International Federation of Netball Associations|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WNA is responsible for national championships, [[Wales national netball team|Welsh squad]] selection, international matches, the training and development of players, coaches, and umpires and for the [[Sport Wales National Centre]] Netball Academy, [[Cardiff]].&lt;ref name=wna-wales&gt;{{harvnb|Welsh Netball Association|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh Netball Association is based in [[Pontcanna]], Cardiff.&lt;ref name=wna-wales/&gt; Like other national associations, the Welsh have created a modified version of the game for children called "Dragon Netball".&lt;ref name=ifna-wales/&gt; The rate of comparative participation for netball to other sports differs from key-stage to key-stage (year levels in school) in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name=Mahoney-109&gt;{{harvnb|Mahoney|1997|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern Ireland, about 1,300 women play competitive netball in club-based leagues.&lt;ref name=Mahoney-103&gt;{{harvnb|Mahoney|1997|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Netball in Oceania}}
In Australia&lt;ref name=dofaat-2008a/&gt; and New Zealand, netball is one of the most popular sports played by women.&lt;ref name=Davis-5&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|Davis|2006|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abos&gt;{{harvnb|Australian Bureau of Statistics|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jock&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Australia reference included because the country is regionally important in terms of development of the game.!--&gt; Women's sport in Oceania has traditionally had a very low profile.&lt;ref name=Brawley-119&gt;{{harvnb|Brawley|1997|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, netball is popular in Oceania, with its growth partly because of New Zealand encouraging the game and providing money for the training of coaches, umpires and other netball development needs.&lt;ref name=Lal-258&gt;{{harvnb|Lal|Fortune|2000|p=458}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netball is one of the sports at the [[Pacific Games]], a multi-sport event, with participation from countries around the South Pacific, that is held every four years.&lt;ref name=mckinnon-51&gt;{{harvnb|McKinnon|2009|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of netball is growing amongst men on the island countries in Oceania, because sport is an important way for villages to keep in touch with each other.&lt;ref name=mckinnon-51/&gt; The game's popularity can also be seen in local languages, where local words have been created to describe it.&lt;ref name=Sperlich-488&gt;{{harvnb|Sperlich|1997|p=488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oceania Netball Federation]] (ONF) is the governing body for netball in the Oceania region.&lt;ref name=ifna-2011e&gt;{{harvnb|International Federation of Netball Associations|2011e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Netball in New Zealand|New Zealand]], netball is the most popular women's participation sport. In 1984, there were 114,210 players&lt;ref name="Bottenburg-214"/&gt;  and currently there are over 11,000 teams and 120,440 players.&lt;ref name=Thompson-258 /&gt; The only sport with more players is golf, which has 128,860 male and female players.&lt;ref name=Thompson-258 /&gt; Ninety-eight percent of New Zealand netball players are female.&lt;ref name=Bottenburg-169&gt;{{harvnb|Van Bottenburg|2001|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sports with the next highest rates of female participation are [[field hockey]] and [[horse racing]], both at sixty-four percent.&lt;ref name=Bottenburg-170&gt;{{harvnb|Van Bottenburg|2001|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netball is extremely popular amongst [[Māori people|Māori]] women, who are more active in sport in general than their white counterparts.&lt;ref name=Thompson-257&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|2002|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand took part in the 1960 netball meeting of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]] to try to standardise the rules for the game.&lt;ref name=ifna-2008/&gt; New Zealand has a history of netball being a spectator sport with the games being televised on [[Television New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=Thompson-258 /&gt; The 1999 Netball World Championships final between Australia and New Zealand was the highest rated program ever on New Zealand television.&lt;ref name=Thompson-258 /&gt; New Zealand also has a men's national team that has competed in the 2009 and 2011 International Challenge Men's and Mixed Netball Tournament.&lt;ref name=samoa-men/&gt; As of August 2015, the women's national team was ranked number two in the world.&lt;ref name="International Netball Federation"/&gt;

The [[Netball in the Cook Islands|Cook Islands]] are a major netball playing country in Oceania,&lt;ref name="nsing-2011b"&gt;{{harvnb|Netball Singapore|2011b}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 1,000 registered members.&lt;ref name=cina-2009&gt;{{harvnb|Cook Islands Netball Association|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game became popular during the 1970s,&lt;ref name="Lal-258"/&gt; and is an important sport in the region.&lt;ref name=Crocombe-13&gt;{{harvnb|Crocombe|1990|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has participated at several international events including the [[Pacific Games]],&lt;ref name=Crocombe-13/&gt; the [[Commonwealth Games]],&lt;ref name=Crocombe-54&gt;{{harvnb|Crocombe|1990|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Netball World Championships,&lt;ref name="Crocombe-54"/&gt; the [[World Games]],&lt;ref name=Crocombe-13/&gt; the Oceania Netball Tournament,&lt;ref name=Crocombe-13/&gt; the [[World Youth Netball Championship]],&lt;ref name="nsing-2011b"/&gt; and the International Challenge Men's and Mixed Netball Tournament.&lt;ref name=samoa-men&gt;{{harvnb|Samoa Observer|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netball has a lot of grass roots support and is an important part of life for many women on the islands.&lt;ref name=Alexeyeff-45&gt;{{harvnb|Alexeyeff|2009|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alexeyeff-85&gt;{{harvnb|Alexeyeff|2009|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sport's popularity is partly due to the influence of New Zealand, where Cook Island players have competed for New Zealand's national team. New Zealand worked hard to develop the sport in the country during the 1980s, when they hosted a number of coaching and umpiring clinics.&lt;ref name=Lal-258/&gt; The Cook Islands won the netball competition at the first [[South Pacific Games]] (now Pacific Games), held in 1981.&lt;ref name="Crocombe-13"/&gt; In the 1990 Oceania Netball Tournament, the team beat New Zealand, [[Tonga]] and Fiji to come in second, behind Australia.&lt;ref name="Crocombe-13"/&gt; As of August 2015, the women's national team was ranked number twenty-three in the world.&lt;ref name="International Netball Federation"/&gt;

Women's participation in [[netball in Fiji]] is comparable to men's participation in rugby.&lt;ref name=Starnes-42&gt;{{harvnb|Starnes|Luckham|2009|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sport started to grow in popularity during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Lal-258" /&gt;  Fiji was supposed to host the 2007 World Netball Championship, but due to a [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|military coup]] the IFNA decided to move the championship to Auckland.&lt;ref name="Starnes-42" /&gt; Netball has a large amount of grassroots support in [[Netball in Samoa|Samoa]]. The sport started to grow in popularity during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Lal-258" /&gt; Games in Fiji and Samoa are most often played by girls on Saturdays during the winter, though games can be played at all times of the year.&lt;ref name="mckinnon-51" /&gt; Samoa and Fiji are traditional netball rivals, competing against each other at events like the Pacific Games.&lt;ref name="mckinnon-51" /&gt; As of August 2015, Samoa's national team was ranked number fourteen in the world and Fiji's was ranked number seven.&lt;ref name="International Netball Federation"/&gt;

'''Hamburger University''' is a {{convert|130000|sqft|sing=on}} [[training]] facility of [[McDonald's]], located in [[Oak Brook, Illinois]], a western [[suburb]] of [[Chicago]]. This [[corporate university]] was designed to instruct personnel employed by McDonald's in the various aspects of [[restaurant management]]. More than 80,000 restaurant managers, mid-managers and owner/operators have "graduated" from this facility.&lt;ref name="hamu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/corporate_careers/training_and_development/hamburger_university.html|title=Hamburger University|publisher=McDonald's|date=2011|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
Since its establishment, Hamburger University has been situated on an {{convert|80|acre}} campus. Restaurant employees receive approximately 32 hours of training in their first month with McDonald's and more than 5,000 students attend Hamburger University each year. Founder [[Ray Kroc]] oversaw lessons at its beginning.

In 2016 McDonald's Corporation announced it would move its U.S. and world headquarters including Hamburger University from its long time home in Oak Brook to a newly built complex on property which formerly housed [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[Harpo Productions|Harpo Studios]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/06/13/mcdonalds-moving-headquarters-to-chicago/85821422/ McDonald's moving headquarters to downtown Chicago by 2018] (Retrieved from USA Today on 31 March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-mcdonalds-headquarters-0603-biz-20160602-story.html McDonald's to move HQ to Chicago as soon as 2018, source says] (Retrieved from the Chicago Tribune on 31 March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-mcdonalds-oak-brook-property-20180112-story.html McDonald's begins selling off Oak Brook property before headquarters move] (Retrieved from the Chicago Tribune on 31 March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2017 McDonald's put up for sale or sold most of its Oak Brook campus.

==Popular culture==
Hamburger University was satirized in the 1986 comedy, ''[[Hamburger... The Motion Picture]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{BFI Explore|id=4ce2b722ee9e8|title=Hamburger - The Motion Picture}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also spoofed by McDonald's itself in a commercial with [[Ronald McDonald]] in which several [[animatronic]] hamburgers were shown graduating from school.

'''Hungarian Templeton Program''' is a unique pilot program taking place between 15/09/2015 and 28/02/2017. The main purpose of the program is to develop and support exceptional Hungarian cognitive talents in the 10-29 age group.

==John Templeton Foundation==
[[Sir John Templeton]] (1912-2008) was strongly committed to supporting research in science, theology, philosophy and the social sciences. One of the main goals of his endeavors was to contribute to understanding the fundamental underlying principles of the universe and to building a better society on the ethical, intellectual and spiritual levels. 
He founded the [[John Templeton Foundation]] in 1987, which also includes the [[Templeton World Charity Foundation]]. The TWCF chooses which initiatives it funds and does not accept unsolicited proposals. In accordance with the testamentary provisions of [[Sir John Templeton]] , it supports worthy programs which seek answers to the "big questions" and challenges of life and the universe. As well, it provides assistance to persons with exceptional cognitive talent who contribute to the flourishing of humanity.

==Hungarian Templeton Program==
This program is implemented with the funding and the support of the [[Templeton World Charity Foundation]] and of the [[European Social Fund]] as co-sponsor. The program's advisory partner is the Association of Hungarian Talent Support Organizations ([[:hu:Magyar Tehetségsegítő Szervezetek Szövetsége|Magyar Tehetségsegítő Szervezetek Szövetsége]] - MATEHETSZ).
Launched on September 15, 2015 and lasting until February 28, 2017, the Hungarian Templeton Program is a unique pilot program whose main objective is to develop and support exceptional Hungarian cognitive talents in the 10-29 age group. Using a new methodology specifically designed for this purpose, program staff will identify 300 Hungarian youth with exceptional cognitive talents (Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows) as well as 150 disadvantaged children aged 5–8 with exceptional cognitive talents.

The aim of the program is to bring together a creative community and network of exceptionally talented people whose members will, with the assistance of top-performing contemporary personalities, prepare themselves to take on the momentous task of becoming the leaders, thinkers and entrepreneurs of Hungary and Europe in the decades ahead.

A customized one-year talent support program will be developed for each of the selected talented youth (the Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows). The program also devotes special attention to underprivileged children aged 5–8. It uses a unique talent testing procedure created for this age group, as well as a talent development program consisting of workshop sessions over a period of several days.

The program also offers assistance to talented youth identified during the selection process but not chosen as Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows by offering them access to the ESF "Talents for Hungary" enrichment programs also supported by the Association of Hungarian Talent Support Organizations (MATEHETSZ).

==Selection process==
The 300 Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows are to be selected using objective scientific criteria and a new methodology. Selection will involve tests measuring aptitudes in a number of areas.

===For talented youth aged 10-19===
IQ test, vocabulary, problem solving, working memory, motivation and creativity.

===For talented youth aged 20-29===
IQ test, evaluation of achievements and productivity based on a motivation letter, activities thus far, level of interest and an introductory presentation or video.

==Program framework==
Cognitive talents selected for the program – the Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows – will each benefit from a one-year customized talent support package. Each young person will receive one-on-one mentoring from prominent Hungarian scientists and entrepreneurs who make up the program's roster of mentors. 
Elements of the support program include '''[[e-learning]]; [[coaching]]; [[personality development]]; [[Business networking|networking]]; development of communication, [[linguistic]], computer, [[research]], [[innovation]], financial and entrepreneurial skills; assistance in choosing a career path in a context of [[social responsibility]].'''
 
In addition to supporting skill development in specific areas, the program places especial emphasis on encouraging Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows to use their aptitudes and knowledge responsibly for the '''good of society'''.

==Program content==
Based on their individual needs and the options available in the program, Junior Fellows will receive a personalized talent support package which may include:

* Participation in scientific research and development projects 
* Familiarization with research centers, cases and practices in both scientific and business contexts
* Scholarships
* International travel (competitions, camps, conferences)
* Business trainings (e.g. Lean, Start-up)
* [[LinkedIn]], Everyday Heroes and PREZI trainings
* Public speaking and presentation-making trainings
* Language learning opportunities 
* Familiarization with case studies in a business context
* Soft skill trainings 
* Activities to develop social responsibility
* Drafting business plans, support for start-ups 
* Support for social entrepreneurs (Ashoka) 
* Participation in national and international talent day events 
* Innovation camp

==Post-program opportunities==
This pilot program is for one year, and is expected to continue in [[Hungary]] and serve as a model for expansion into other countries in versions adapted to regional cultural differences. Talented youth selected for the program will be monitored and assisted for a few years after the end of the program by the ongoing network of contacts in the Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellow Network.

==Mentoring==
Substantive support for the Program is provided by our network of mentors: scientists, researchers, experts and businesspeople who have shown exceptional levels of achievement in their fields and careers. Mentoring is a crucial element of the program and a mentor will be assigned to every Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellow.

[[File:Hyperloop all cutaway.png|thumb|Concept art of Hyperloop inner workings|265x265px]]

A '''Hyperloop''' is a proposed mode of [[public transport|passenger]] and/or [[freight transport]]ation, first used to describe an open-source [[vactrain]] design released by a joint team from [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] and [[SpaceX]].&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt; Drawing heavily from [[Robert Goddard]]'s vactrain, a hyperloop is a sealed tube or system of tubes through which a pod may travel free of air resistance or friction conveying people or objects at high speed while being very efficient.

[[Elon Musk|Elon Musk's]] version of the concept, first publicly mentioned in 2012,&lt;ref name="PandoDaily Hyperloop"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pando Monthly presents a fireside chat with Elon Musk |url=https://pando.com/2012/07/12/pandomonthly-presents-a-fireside-chat-with-elon-musk/ |website=pando.com |publisher=PandoDaily |access-date=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporates reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on [[air bearing]]s driven by [[linear induction motor]]s and [[axial compressor]]s.&lt;ref name=gm20130822/&gt;

The Hyperloop Alpha concept was first published in August 2013, proposing and examining a route running from the [[Los Angeles]] region to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], roughly following the [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] corridor. The paper conceived of a hyperloop system that would propel passengers along the {{convert|350|mi|km|adj=on|sigfig=2}} route at a speed of {{convert|760|mph|km/h|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, allowing for a travel time of 35 minutes, which is considerably faster than current rail or air travel times. Preliminary cost estimates for this LA–SF suggested route were included in the white paper—{{US$|6 billion|link=yes}} for a passenger-only version, and {{US$|7.5 billion}} for a somewhat larger-diameter version transporting passengers and vehicles&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt;—although transportation analysts had doubts that the system could be constructed on that budget; some analysts claimed that the Hyperloop would be several billion dollars overbudget, taking into consideration construction, development, and operation costs.&lt;ref name="NYT-Bilton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AJE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPoAstronomical"/&gt;

The Hyperloop concept has been explicitly "open-sourced" by Musk and SpaceX, and others have been encouraged to take the ideas and further develop them.

To that end, a few companies have been formed, and several interdisciplinary student-led teams are working to advance the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/18/11965354/hyperloop-pod-competition-elon-musk-spacex-team-design|title=Here are the Hyperloop pods competing in Elon Musk's big race later this year|last=Hawkins|first=Andrew J.|date=June 18, 2016 |website=The Verge|access-date=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; SpaceX built an approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|-long|adj=mid}} [[scale model|subscale]] track for its [[Hyperloop pod competition|pod design competition]] at its headquarters in [[Hawthorne, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Etherington|first1=Darrell|title=Here's a first look at the SpaceX Hyperloop test track|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/02/heres-a-first-look-at-the-spacex-hyperloop-test-track/|publisher=TechCrunch|date=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts are skeptical, saying that the proposals ignore the expenses and risks of developing the technology and that the idea is "completely impractical".&lt;ref name="Mercury-2016-09-16"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2013/08/13/wolverton-elon-musks-hyperloop-hype-ignores-practical-problems/ |title=Wolverton: Elon Musk's Hyperloop hype ignores practical problems |first=Troy |last=Wolverton |work=The Mercury News |date=August 13, 2013 |access-date=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims have also been made that the Hyperloop is too susceptible to disruption from a power outage or terror attacks to be considered safe.&lt;ref name="Mercury-2016-09-16"/&gt;&lt;!--alpha doc covers this on page 53--&gt;

==History==

The general idea of trains or other transportation traveling [[vactrain|through evacuated tubes]] dates back more than a century, although the [[atmospheric railway]] was never a commercial success. &lt;!--[[Elon Musk]]'s Hyperloop uses only partial vacuum, with a compressor to absorb the pressure wave and avoid the Kantrowitz limit, with air-bearing skis, and linear induction motors, very low energy use per passenger-mile or ton-mile, storing energy so as to power the technology from solar over a 24-hour diurnal cycle, etc; however, that technical summary is better left in another section of this article, not History.--&gt;

Musk first mentioned that he was thinking about a concept for a "fifth mode of transport", calling it the ''Hyperloop'', in July 2012 at a [[PandoDaily]] event in [[Santa Monica, California]]. This hypothetical high-speed mode of transportation would have the following characteristics: immunity to weather, collision free, twice the speed of a plane, low power consumption, and energy storage for 24-hour operations.&lt;ref name="pandovideo"/&gt;&lt;!-- approx. 43 minutes into the video recording --&gt; The name ''Hyperloop'' was chosen because it would go in a loop. Musk envisions the more advanced versions will be able to go at [[hypersonic speed]].&lt;ref name="youtube20160131"&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab2VVp1GfmA |title=Elon Musk speaks at the Hyperloop Pod Award Ceremony |publisher=YouTube.com |date=January 30, 2016 |access-date=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, Musk likened the Hyperloop to a "cross between a [[Concorde]] and a [[railgun]] and an [[air hockey]] table".&lt;ref name="atd20130530"/&gt;

From late 2012 until August 2013, a group of engineers from both [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]] and [[SpaceX]] worked on the conceptual modeling of Hyperloop.&lt;ref name="gm20130813"/&gt; An early system design was published in the Tesla and SpaceX blogs&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AlphaTesla"/&gt; which describes one potential design, function, pathway, and cost of a hyperloop system.&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt; According to the alpha design, pods would accelerate to cruising speed gradually using a linear electric motor and glide above their track on [[air bearings]] through tubes above ground on columns or below ground in tunnels to avoid the dangers of [[grade crossing]]s. An ideal hyperloop system will be more energy-efficient,&lt;ref name=EDS_power_consumption&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.pes-publications.ee.ethz.ch/uploads/tx_ethpublications/22_Scaling_laws_for_electrodynamic_suspension_Flankl_accepted-version.pdf |title= Scaling laws for electrodynamic suspension in high-speed transportation |last1=Flankl |first1=Michael |last2=Wellerdieck |first2=Tobias |last3=Tüysüz |first3=Arda |last4=Kolar |first4=Johann W. |journal= IET Electric Power Applications |date=November 2017 |access-date=February 2, 2018 |doi=10.1049/iet-epa.2017.0480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESC_Hyperloop"&gt;{{cite AV media |url=http://www.esc.ethz.ch/news/archive/2017/11/energy-efficiency-of-an-electrodynamically-levitated-hyperloop-pod.html |title=Energy Efficiency of an Electrodynamically Levitated Hyperloop Pod |publisher=Energy Science Center |date=November 29, 2017 |access-date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; quiet, and [[vehicular automation|autonomous]] than existing modes of mass transit. Musk has also invited feedback to "see if the people can find ways to improve it". The Hyperloop Alpha was released as an [[open source]] design.&lt;ref name="globemail20130812"/&gt; The word mark "''HYPERLOOP''", applicable to "high-speed transportation of goods in tubes" was issued to SpaceX on April 4, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Word Mark HYPERLOOP|url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4810:6uwa73.2.7|publisher=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Muoio|first1=Danielle|title=Everything we know about Elon Musk's ambitious Hyperloop plan|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-hyperloop-plan-boring-company-2017-8|accessdate=September 10, 2017|publisher=Business Insider|date=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, SpaceX announced that it would build a {{convert|1|mi|km|-long|adj=mid}} test track to be located next to SpaceX's [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]] facility. The track would be used to test pod designs supplied by third parties in the competition.&lt;ref name="CNNmoney-15-6-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SFchronicle-6-15-15"/&gt;

By November 2015, with several commercial companies and dozens of student teams pursuing the development of Hyperloop technologies, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' asserted that "The Hyperloop Movement", as some of its unaffiliated members refer to themselves, is officially bigger than the man who started it."&lt;ref name=wsj20151130&gt;{{cite news |last=Chee |first=Alexander |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-race-to-create-elon-musks-hyperloop-heats-up-1448899356 |title=The Race to Create Elon Musk's Hyperloop Heats Up |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=November 30, 2015 |access-date=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and operation==
[[File:Hyperloop capsule.svg|thumb|Artist's impression of a Hyperloop capsule: [[Axial compressor]] on the front, passenger compartment in the middle, battery compartment at the back, and [[air caster]] skis at the bottom]]
[[File:Hyperloop.jpg|thumb|A 3D sketch of the Hyperloop infrastructure. The steel tubes are rendered transparent in this image.]]

Developments in [[high-speed rail]] have historically been impeded by the difficulties in managing [[friction]] and [[air resistance]],{{Citation needed|reason=The needed power to overcome drag per person on a long train shouldn't be that much that it eclipses the significance of the suspension, the real problem. Long vehicles have low skin drag coefficients because of the thicker boundary layer.|date=February 2018}} both of which become substantial when vehicles approach high speeds. The [[vactrain]] concept theoretically eliminates these obstacles by employing [[maglev|magnetically levitating]] trains in [[vacuum|evacuated]] (airless) or partly evacuated tubes, allowing for speeds of thousands of miles per hour. However, the high cost of [[maglev]] and the difficulty of maintaining a vacuum over large distances has prevented this type of system from ever being built. The Hyperloop resembles a vactrain system but operates at approximately {{convert|1|mbar|Pa|spell=in|lk=on}} of pressure.&lt;ref name="nova20130813"/&gt;

===Initial design concept===

The Hyperloop concept operates by sending specially designed "capsules" or "pods" through a steel tube maintained at a partial vacuum. In Musk's original concept, each capsule floats on a {{convert|0.5-1.3|mm|in|2|order=flip|abbr=on}} layer of air provided under pressure to [[air caster|air-caster]] "skis", similar to how pucks are levitated above an [[air hockey]] table, while still allowing faster speeds than wheels can sustain. [[Hyperloop One]]'s technology uses passive [[maglev]] for the same purpose. [[Linear induction motor]]s located along the tube would accelerate and decelerate the capsule to the appropriate speed for each section of the tube route. With [[rolling resistance]] eliminated and air resistance greatly reduced, the capsules can [[gliding flight|glide]] for the bulk of the journey. In Musk's original Hyperloop concept, an electrically driven [[ducted fan|inlet fan]] and [[axial compressor]] would be placed at the nose of the capsule to "actively transfer high-pressure air from the front to the rear of the vessel", resolving the problem of air pressure building in front of the vehicle, slowing it down.&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt; A fraction of the air is shunted to the skis for additional pressure, augmenting that gain passively from lift due to their shape. Hyperloop One's system does away with the compressor.

In the alpha-level concept, passenger-only pods are to be {{convert|2.23|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} in diameter&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt; and projected to reach a top speed of {{convert|760|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to maintain aerodynamic efficiency.&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt; (Section 4.4)&lt;/sup&gt; The design proposes passengers experience a maximum inertial [[g-force|acceleration]] of 0.5&amp;nbsp;g, about 2 or 3 times that of a commercial airliner on takeoff and landing.

===Proposed routes===
[[File:Interstate5 map.png|thumb|206x206px|Interstate 5]]

A number of routes have been proposed for Hyperloop systems that meet the approximate distance conditions for which a Hyperloop is hypothesized to provide improved transport times. Route ''proposals'' range from speculation described in company releases to [[business case]]s to signed agreements.

====United States====

The route suggested in the 2013 alpha-level design document was from the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]] to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. That conceptual system would begin around [[Sylmar, California|Sylmar]], just south of the [[Tejon Pass]], follow [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] to the north, and arrive near [[Hayward, California|Hayward]] on the east side of San Francisco Bay. Several proposed branches were also shown in the design document, including [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[San Diego]], and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt;

No work has been done on the route proposed in Musk's alpha-design; one cited reason is that it would terminate on the fringes of the two major metropolitan areas (Los Angeles and San Francisco), resulting in significant cost savings in construction, but requiring that passengers traveling to and from [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and San Francisco, and any other community beyond Sylmar and Hayward, to transfer to another transportation mode in order to reach their final destination. This would significantly lengthen the total travel time to those destinations.&lt;ref name="GGW"/&gt;

A similar problem already affects present-day air travel, where on short routes (like LAX-SFO) the flight time is only a rather small part of door to door travel time. Critics have argued that this would significantly reduce the proposed cost and/or time savings of Hyperloop as compared to the [[California High-Speed Rail]] project that will serve downtown stations in both San Francisco and Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pedestrianobservations.wordpress.com/2013/08/13/loopy-ideas-are-fine-if-youre-an-entrepreneur |title=Loopy Ideas Are Fine, If You're an Entrepreneur |work=Pedestrian Observations |first=Alon |last=Levy |date=August 13, 2013 |access-date=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stopandmove.blogspot.de/2013/08/hyperloop-proposal-bad-joke-or-attempt.html |title=Hyperloop proposal: Bad joke or attempt to sabotage California HSR project? |work=Stop and Move |first=James |last=Sinclair |date=August 12, 2013 |access-date=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/19848/musks-hyperloop-math-doesnt-add-up |title=Musk's Hyperloop math doesn't add up |work=Greater Greater Washington |first=Matt |last=Johnson |date=August 14, 2013 |access-date=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passengers travelling financial centre to financial centre are estimated to save about two hours by taking the Hyperloop instead of driving the whole distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://transportandtravel.wordpress.com/2016/03/21/pipedreams |title=Pipedreams |work=Transport and Travel |first=Pat |last=Humphreys |date=March 23, 2016 |access-date=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others questioned the cost projections for the suggested California route. Some transportation engineers argued in 2013 that they found the alpha-level design cost estimates unrealistically low given the scale of construction and reliance on unproven technology. The technological and [[economic feasibility]] of the idea is unproven and a subject of significant debate.&lt;ref name="NYT-Bilton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AJE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPoAstronomical"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GGW"/&gt;

In November, 2017, [[Arrivo]] announced a plan for a maglev automobile transport system from [[Aurora, Colorado]] to [[Denver International Airport]], the first leg of a system from downtown Denver.&lt;ref name="fm171114"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jenkins|first1=Aric|title=A Guy Named Brogan BamBrogan Wants to Bring a 200 mph Hyperloop to Denver.

===Open-source design evolution===
In September 2013, [[Ansys]] Corporation ran [[computational fluid dynamics]] simulations to model the aerodynamics of the capsule and [[shear stress]] forces that the capsule would be subjected to. The simulation showed that the capsule design would need to be significantly reshaped to avoid creating [[supersonic]] airflow, and that the gap between the tube wall and capsule would need to be larger. Ansys employee Sandeep Sovani said the simulation showed that Hyperloop has challenges but that he is convinced it is feasible.&lt;ref name="Discovery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNet"/&gt;

In October 2013, the development team of the [[OpenMDAO]] software framework released an unfinished, conceptual open-source model of parts of the Hyperloop's propulsion system. The team asserted that the model demonstrated the concept's feasibility, although the tube would need to be {{convert|4|m|order=flip}} in diameter,&lt;ref name="openmdao"/&gt; significantly larger than originally projected. However, the team's model is not a true working model of the propulsion system, as it did not account for a wide range of technological factors required to physically construct a Hyperloop based on Musk's concept, and in particular had no significant estimations of component weight.&lt;ref name="github-mdao"/&gt;

In November 2013, [[MathWorks]] analyzed the proposal's suggested route and concluded that the route was mainly feasible. The analysis focused on the [[g-force|acceleration]] experienced by passengers and the necessary deviations from public roads in order to keep the accelerations reasonable; it did highlight that maintaining a trajectory along I-580 east of San Francisco at the planned speeds was not possible without significant deviation into heavily populated areas.&lt;ref name="mathworks20131122"/&gt;

In January 2015, a paper based on the NASA [[OpenMDAO]] open-source model reiterated the need for a larger diameter tube and a reduced cruise speed closer to Mach 0.85. It recommended removing on-board heat exchangers based on thermal models of the interactions between the compressor cycle, tube, and ambient environment. The compression cycle would only contribute 5% of the heat added to the tube, with 95% of the heat attributed to radiation and convection into the tube. The weight and volume penalty of on-board heat exchangers would not be worth the minor benefit, and regardless the steady-state temperature in the tube would only reach {{convert|30|-|40|F-change|C-change}} above ambient temperature.&lt;ref name="Chin2015"/&gt;

Hyperloop One has a 75,000-square foot Innovation Campus in downtown LA and a 100,000-square foot machine and tooling shop in North Las Vegas. By 2017, it had completed a 500m Development Loop (DevLoop) in North Las Vegas, Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/28747-hyperloop-one-devloop-nevada-test-track|publisher=Inverse|date=March 7, 2017 |title=Photos: Hyperloop One Shows Off 'DevLoop' Test Tube in Nevada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, 2016, Hyperloop One conducted the first live trial of Hyperloop technology, demonstrating that its custom linear electric motor could propel a sled from 0 to 110 miles an hour in just over one second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://digg.com/2016/hyperloop-one-test-video-elon-musk |title=Watch The First Real-World Test Of Hyperloop Technology |first=Dan |last=Fallon |work=Digg |location=US |date=May 11, 2016 |access-date=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[g-force|acceleration]] exerted approximately 2.5 g on the sled. The sled was stopped at the end of the test by hitting a pile of sand at the end of the track, because the test was not intended to test braking components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3585662/It-works-Elon-Musk-s-super-fast-Hyperloop-successfully-demonstrated-Las-Vegas.html |title=Elon Musk's Hyperloop is successfully demonstrated in Las Vegas |first1=Ellie |last1=Zolfagharifard |first2=Richard |last2=Gray |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=Australia |date=May 12, 2016 |access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Hyperloop One released a preliminary study that suggested a Hyperloop connection between [[Helsinki]] and [[Stockholm]] would be feasible, reducing the travel time between the cities to half an hour. The construction costs were estimated by Hyperloop One to be around {{euro|19 billion}} ({{US$|21 billion}} at 2016 exchange rates).&lt;ref name=helsinki-verge&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/5/12099612/hyperloop-one-helsinki-stockholm-30-minutes-study |title=Hyperloop One says it can connect Helsinki to Stockholm in under 30 minutes |last1=Hawkins |first1=Andrew J. |work=The Verge |location=US |access-date=July 6, 2016 |date=July 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Hyperloop One announced a deal with the world's third largest ports operator, DP World, to develop a cargo offloader system at DP World's flagship port of Jebel Ali in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hyperloop-one-dp-world-sign-agreement-to-pursue-a-hyperloop-route-in-dubai-300313889.html |title=Hyperloop One, DP World Sign Agreement To Pursue A Hyperloop Route In Dubai}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperloop One also broke ground on DevLoop, its full-scale Hyperloop test track.

In November 2016, Hyperloop One disclosed that it has established a high-level working group relationship with the governments of Finland and the Netherlands to study the viability of building Hyperloop proof of operations centers in those countries. Hyperloop One also has a feasibility study underway with Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority for passenger systems in the UAE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kharpal |first1=Arjun |title=Hyperloop One explores setting up high-speed transport system in Finland, Netherlands, Dubai |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/10/hyperloop-one-finland-netherlands-dubai-setting-up-high-speed-transport-system.html |work=CNBC |access-date=November 11, 2016 |date=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other feasibility studies are underway in Russia, Los Angeles, and the Netherlands.

In May 12, 2017, Hyperloop One performed its first full-scale Hyperloop test, becoming the first company in the world to test a full-scale Hyperloop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/story/hyperloop-one-test-success/|work=Wired |date=July 12, 2017 |title=Hyperloop's first real test is a whooshing success}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system-wide test integrated Hyperloop components including vacuum, propulsion, levitation, sled, control systems, tube, and structures.

On July 12, 2017, the company revealed images of its first generation pod prototype, which will be used at the DevLoop test site in Nevada to test aerodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.curbed.com/2017/7/12/15960522/hyperloop-one-pod-design-test |first=Alissa |last=Walker |work=Curbed |date=July 12, 2017 |title=Hyperloop One reveals full-size prototype of its shiny new pod design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 2017, the company received a "significant investment" from the Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, leading to a rebrand of the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/introducing-virgin-hyperloop-one-worlds-most-revolutionary-train-service |title=Introducing Virgin Hyperloop One – the world's most revolutionary train service |last=Branson |first=Richard |date=October 12, 2017 |publisher=Virgin |access-date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Richard Branson of Virgin Hyperloop One announced that he had a preliminary agreement with the [[Maharashtra]] State government to build the Mumbai-Pune Hyperloop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/indyventure/virgin-hyperloop-india-pune-mumbai-fast-shuttle-train-maharashtra-richard-branson-narendra-modi-a8217511.html |title=Virgin to build super-fast Hyperloop shuttle between Pune and Mumbai as India ramps up infrastructure spending |first=Joe |last=Sommerlad |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=February 19, 2018 |access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hyperloop Transportation Technologies===

[[Hyperloop Transportation Technologies]] (HTT) was a group of more than 800 engineers{{when|date=July 2018}} and professionals located around the world. Some collaborate part-time; others are full-time employees and contributors. Some members are full-time paid employees; others work in exchange for salary and [[stock option]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

HTT announced in May 2015 that a deal had been finalized with landowners to build a {{convert|5|mi|km|0|adj=on}} test track along a stretch of road near [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] between Los Angeles and San Francisco.&lt;ref name="fortune20150520"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fortune.com/2015/05/20/elon-musk-hyperloop-test-track-california/ |title=Elon Musk's craziest project is coming closer to reality |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |first=Daniel |last=Roberts |date=May 20, 2015 |access-date=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies and the government of [[Abu Dhabi]] announced plans to conduct a feasibility study on a Hyperloop link between the [[UAE]] capital and [[Al Ain]], reducing travel time between Abu Dhabi and Al Ain to just under 10-minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abu Dhabi explores Hyperloop link with Al Ain, potentially transforming cruise tourism in the city|url=http://www.cruisearabiaonline.com/middle-east-cruise-news/2016/12/12/Abu-Dhabi-explores-Hyperloop-link-with-Al-Ain--potentially-transforming-cruise-tourism-in-city|publisher=Cruise Arabia &amp; Africa|date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2017, HTT announced and signed an agreement with the [[Andhra Pradesh]] government to build a track from [[Amaravathi]] to [[Vijayawada]] in a [[public-private partnership]], and suggested that the more than one hour trip could be reduced to 5 minutes through the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/first-hyperloop-in-india-to-be-launched-between-amravati-and-vijayawada/articleshow/60395340.cms |title=First Hyperloop in India to be launched between Amravati and Vijayawada |work=The Times of India |author=Satyanarayan Iyer |date=September 6, 2017 |access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/railways/htt-to-build-indias-first-hyperloop-connecting-amaravati-vijayawada/articleshow/60395268.cms |title=Amaravati to Vijayawada in 5 minutes!

A number of student and non-student teams were participating in a [[Hyperloop pod competition]] in 2015–16, and at least 22 of them built hardware to compete on a sponsored hyperloop test track in mid-2016.&lt;ref name=verge20160130&gt;{{cite news |last=Hawkins |first=Andrew J. |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/30/10877442/elon-musk-spacex-hyperloop-competition-awards |title=MIT wins SpaceX's Hyperloop competition, and Elon Musk made a cameo |work=The Verge |date=January 30, 2016 |access-date=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, [[SpaceX]] announced that they would sponsor a Hyperloop pod design competition, and would build a {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} subscale test track near SpaceX's headquarters in [[Hawthorne, California]] for the competitive event in 2016.&lt;ref name="NBChyperloop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hyper-pod-competition"/&gt; SpaceX stated in their announcement, "Neither SpaceX nor Elon Musk is affiliated with any Hyperloop companies.

==Criticism and human factor considerations==
Some critics of Hyperloop focus on the experience—possibly unpleasant and frightening—of riding in a narrow, sealed, windowless capsule inside a sealed steel tunnel, that is subjected to significant [[g-force|acceleration forces]]; high noise levels due to air being compressed and ducted around the capsule at near-sonic speeds; and the vibration and jostling.&lt;ref name="insider20130820"/&gt; Even if the tube is initially smooth, ground may shift with seismic activity. At high speeds, even minor deviations from a straight path may add considerable buffeting.&lt;ref name="verge20130816"/&gt; This is in addition to practical and logistical questions regarding how to best deal with safety issues such as equipment malfunction, accidents, and emergency evacuations.

Other [[maglev]] trains are already in use, which avoid much of the added costs of Hyperloop. The [[SCMaglev]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/21/japans-maglev-train-notches-up-new-world-speed-record-in-test-run|title=Japan's maglev train breaks world speed record with 600km/h test run|first=Justin|last=McCurry|date=April 21, 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Japan has demonstrated {{convert|603|km/h|mph|abbr=on|0}} without a vacuum tube, by using an extremely aerodynamic train design. It also avoids the cost and time required to pressurize and depressurize the exit and entry points of a Hyperloop tube.

There is also the criticism of design technicalities in the tube system. Prof. John Hansman has stated problems, such as how a slight misalignment in the tube would be compensated for and the potential interplay between the air cushion and the low-pressure air. He has also questioned what would happen if the power were to go out when the pod was miles away from a city. Prof. Richard Muller has also expressed concern regarding "[the Hyperloop's] novelty and the vulnerability of its tubes, [which] would be a tempting target for terrorists", and that the system could be disrupted by everyday dirt and grime.&lt;ref name="Mercury-2016-09-16"/&gt;

==Political and economic considerations==
The alpha proposal projected that cost savings compared with conventional rail would come from a combination of several factors. The small profile and elevated nature of the alpha route would enable Hyperloop to be constructed primarily in the median of [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]]. However, whether this would be truly feasible is a matter of debate. The low profile would reduce tunnel boring requirements and the light weight of the capsules is projected to reduce construction costs over conventional passenger rail. It was asserted that there would be less [[right-of-way]] opposition and environmental impact as well due to its small, sealed, elevated profile versus that of a rail easement;&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt; however, other commentators contend that a smaller footprint does not guarantee less opposition.&lt;ref name="GGW"/&gt; In criticizing this assumption, [[mass transportation]] writer Alon Levy said, "In reality, an all-elevated system (which is what Musk proposes with the Hyperloop) is a bug rather than a feature. Central Valley land is cheap; pylons are expensive, as can be readily seen by the costs of elevated highways and trains all over the world".&lt;ref name="NationalReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPoWonkBlog"/&gt; Michael Anderson, a professor of agricultural and resource economics at [[UC Berkeley]], predicted that costs would amount to around {{US$|100 billion}}.&lt;ref name="AJE"/&gt;

The Hyperloop white paper suggests that {{US$|20}} of each one-way passenger ticket between Los Angeles and San Francisco would be sufficient to cover initial [[capital (economics)|capital costs]], based on amortizing the cost of Hyperloop over 20 years with ridership projections of 7.4 million per year in each direction and does not include operating costs (although the proposal asserts that electric costs would be covered by solar panels). No total [[fare|ticket price]] was suggested in the alpha design.&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt; The projected ticket price has been questioned by Dan Sperling, director of the [[Institute of Transportation Studies]] at [[UC Davis]], who stated that "there's no way the economics on that would ever work out."&lt;ref name="AJE"/&gt;

The early cost estimates of the Hyperloop are a subject of debate. A number of economists and transportation experts have expressed the belief that the {{US$|6 billion}} price tag dramatically understates the cost of designing, developing, constructing, and testing an all-new form of transportation.&lt;ref name="NYT-Bilton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AJE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GGW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPoWonkBlog"/&gt; ''The Economist'' said that the estimates are unlikely to "be immune to the [[cost overrun|hypertrophication of cost]] that every other grand infrastructure project seems doomed to suffer."&lt;ref name="economist20130817"/&gt;

Political impediments to the construction of such a project in California will be very large. There is a great deal of "political and [[reputation capital]]" invested in the existing mega-project of [[California High-Speed Rail]].&lt;ref name="economist20130817"/&gt; Replacing that with a different design would not be straightforward given California's political economy. Texas has been suggested as an alternate for its more amenable political and economic environment.&lt;ref name="economist20130817"/&gt;

Building a successful Hyperloop sub-scale demonstration project could reduce the political impediments and improve cost estimates. Musk has suggested that he may be personally involved in building a demonstration prototype of the Hyperloop concept, including funding the development effort.&lt;ref name="gm20130813"/&gt;&lt;ref name="economist20130817"/&gt;

The solar panels Musk plans to install along the length of the Hyperloop system have been criticized by Prof. Roger Goodall, as not being feasible enough to return enough energy to power the Hyperloop system, arguing that the air pumps and propulsion would require much more power than the solar panels could generate.&lt;ref name="Mercury-2016-09-16"/&gt;

===Historical===

The concept of transportation of passengers in pneumatic tubes is not new. The first patent to transport goods in tubes was taken out in 1799 by the British mechanical engineer and inventor [[George Medhurst]]. In 1812, Medhurst wrote a book detailing his idea of transporting passengers and goods through air-tight tubes using air propulsion.&lt;ref name="business20130715"/&gt;

In the early 1800s, there were other similar systems proposed or experimented with and were generally known as an [[atmospheric railway]] although this term is also used for systems where the propulsion is provided by a separate pneumatic tube to the train tunnel itself.

One of the earliest was the [[Dalkey Atmospheric Railway]] which operated near Dublin between 1844 and 1854.

The [[Crystal Palace pneumatic railway]] operated in London around 1864 and used large fans, some {{convert|22|ft|m|abbr=on|1}} in diameter, that were powered by a steam engine. The tunnels are now lost but the line operated successfully for over a year.

Operated from 1870 to 1873, the [[Beach Pneumatic Transit]] was a one-block-long prototype of an underground tube transport public transit system in [[New York City]]. The system worked at near-atmospheric pressure, and the passenger car moved by means of higher-pressure air applied to the back of the car while somewhat lower pressure was maintained on the front of the car.&lt;ref name="sa18700305"/&gt;

In the 1910s, vacuum trains were first described by American rocket pioneer [[Robert Goddard]].&lt;ref name=economist20130817/&gt; While the Hyperloop has significant innovations over early proposals for reduced pressure or vacuum-tube transportation apparatus, the work of Goddard "appears to have the greatest overlap with the Hyperloop".&lt;ref name="gm20130822"/&gt;

Princeton Physicist [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] wrote about transcontinental trains using magnetic propulsion in his book "2081: A Hopeful View of the Human Future". While a work of fiction, this book was an attempt to predict future technologies in everyday life. In his prediction, he envisioned these trains which used magnetic levitation running in underground tunnels which had much of the air evacuated to increase speed and reduce friction. He also demonstrated a scale prototype device that accelerated a mass using magnetic propulsion to high speeds. It was called a mass driver and was a central theme in his non-fiction book on space colonization "The High Frontier".

[[Swissmetro]] was a proposal to run a maglev train in a low-pressure environment. Concessions were granted to Swissmetro in the early 2000s to connect the Swiss cities of St. Gallen, Zurich, Basel, and Geneva. Studies of commercial feasibility reached differing conclusions and the vactrain was never built.&lt;ref name="swissmetro"/&gt;

China was reported to be building a vacuum based {{convert|1000|km/h|mph|abbr=on|order=flip|round=50}} maglev train in August 2010 according to a laboratory at Jiaotong University. It was expected to cost {{CNY|10–20 million|link=yes}} ({{US$|2.95 million}} at the August 2010 exchange rate) more per kilometer than regular high-speed rail.&lt;ref name="engadgetsumohurd20100804"/&gt; {{As of|2017|5}}, it has not been built.

===Current===
The [[ET3 Global Alliance]] (ET3) was founded by Daryl Oster in 1997 with the goal of establishing a global transportation system using passenger capsules in frictionless [[magnetic levitation|maglev]] full-vacuum tubes. Oster and his team met with Elon Musk on September 18, 2013, to discuss the technology,&lt;ref name="futurist20131030"/&gt; resulting in Musk promising an investment in a {{convert|3|mi|km|0|adj=on}} prototype of ET3's proposed design.&lt;ref name="denver20130809"/&gt;{{update after|2015|6|17}}&lt;!-- so what is the status of this? are ET3 building anything? --&gt;

==In popular culture==
There are multiple examples of depressurized tubes in literature and media going back to the 19th century. [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s 1972 book ''[[Tunnel Through the Deeps]]'' is an early [[steampunk]] book that give explicit details about how such a system would work both on land and at sea – including the use of underwater bridges to float the tubes across the depths beyond the continental shelf. [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s follow-on to ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Genesis II (film)|Genesis II]]'', used a very similar concept – called a "subshuttle" in the program – to quickly move characters from place to place.

'''IEC 61131''' is an [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standard for [[programmable logic controller|programmable controllers]]. It was known as IEC 1131 before the change in numbering system by IEC. The parts of the IEC 61131 standard are prepared and maintained working group 7, programmable control systems, of subcommittee SC 65B of [[List of IEC technical committees|Technical Committee]] TC65 of the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]].

==Sections of IEC 61131==
Standard ''IEC 61131'' is divided into several parts:&lt;ref&gt;[https://webstore.iec.ch/searchform&amp;q=61131 All parts available for "IEC 61131"], IEC Webstore&lt;/ref&gt;
* Part 1: General information. It is the introductory chapter; it contains definitions of terms that are used in the subsequent parts of the standard and outlines the main functional properties and characteristics of PLCs.
* Part 2: Equipment requirements and tests - establishes the requirements and associated tests for programmable controllers and their peripherals.  This standard prescribes: the normal service conditions and requirements (for example, requirements related with climatic conditions, transport and storage, electrical service, etc.); functional requirements (power supply &amp; memory, digital and analog [[I/O]]s); functional type tests and verification (requirements and tests on environmental, vibration, drop, free fall, I/O, power ports, etc.) and [[electromagnetic compatibility]] (EMC) requirements and tests that programmable controllers must implement.  This standard can serve as a basis in the evaluation of safety programmable controllers to [[IEC 61508]].
* [[IEC 61131-3|Part 3]]: Programming languages
* [[IEC 61131-4|Part 4]]: User guidelines
* [[IEC 61131-5|Part 5]]: Communications
* [[IEC 61131-6|Part 6]]: Functional safety
* [[IEC 61131-7|Part 7]]: [[Fuzzy control]] programming
* [[IEC 61131-8|Part 8]]: Guidelines for the application and implementation of programming languages
* [[IEC 61131-9|Part 9]]: Single-drop digital communication interface for small sensors and actuators (SDCI, marketed as [[IO-Link]]&lt;ref&gt;http://io-link.com/en/Technology/what_is_IO-Link.php?thisID=76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/4558&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.io-link.com/share/Downloads/Spec-Interface/IOL-Interface-Spec_10002_V112_Jul13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;)

A further part is currently being worked on:
* Part 10: XML exchange formats for programs according to IEC 61131-3

DOMs are deployed on strings of 60 modules each at depths between 1,450 to 2,450 meters into holes melted in the ice using a hot water drill. IceCube is designed to look for point sources of [[neutrino]]s in the [[electronvolt|TeV]] range to explore the highest-energy astrophysical processes.

In November 2013 it was announced that IceCube had detected 28 neutrinos that likely originated outside the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref&gt;

IceCube is part of a series of projects developed and supervised by the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. Collaboration and funding are provided by numerous other universities and research institutions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icecube.wisc.edu/collaboration/institutions IceCube Collaborating Organizations]&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of IceCube was only possible during the Antarctic [[austral summer]] from November to February, when permanent sunlight allows for 24-hour drilling. Construction began in 2005, when the first IceCube string was deployed and sufficient data was collected to verify that the optical sensors functioned correctly.&lt;ref name="spcr-1"&gt;

==Sub-detectors==

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is composed of several sub-detectors in addition to the main in-ice array.

*AMANDA, the [[Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array]], was the first part built, and it served as a [[proof-of-concept]] for IceCube. AMANDA was turned off in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;

*The IceTop array is a series of [[Cherenkov detector]]s on the surface of the glacier, with two detectors approximately above each IceCube string. IceTop is used as a [[cosmic ray shower]] detector, for cosmic ray composition studies and [[coincidence method|coincident event]] tests: if a [[muon]] is observed going through IceTop, it cannot be from a neutrino interacting in the ice.
*The Deep Core Low-Energy Extension is a densely instrumented region of the IceCube array which extends the observable energies below 100 [[electronvolt|GeV]]. The Deep Core strings are deployed at the center (in the surface plane) of the larger array, deep in the clearest ice at the bottom of the array (between 1760 and 2450&amp;nbsp;m deep). There are no Deep Core DOMs between 1850&amp;nbsp;m and 2107&amp;nbsp;m depth, as the ice is not as clear in those layers.

PINGU (Precision IceCube Next Generation Upgrade) is a proposed extension that will allow detection of low energy neutrinos (GeV energy scale), with uses including determining the neutrino mass hierarchy, precision measurement of atmospheric neutrino oscillation (both tau neutrino appearance and muon neutrino disappearance), and searching for [[Weakly interacting massive particles|WIMP]] annihilation in the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;

==Experimental mechanism==
Neutrinos are [[electric charge|electrically neutral]] [[lepton]]s, and interact very rarely with matter. When they do react with the molecules of water in the ice, they can create charged leptons ([[electron]]s, [[muon]]s, or [[tau lepton|tau]]s). These charged leptons can, if they are energetic enough, emit [[Cherenkov radiation]]. This happens when the charged particle travels through the ice faster than the [[speed of light]] in the ice, similar to the [[bow shock]] of a boat traveling faster than the waves it crosses. This light can then be detected by [[photomultiplier|photomultiplier tube]]s within the digital optical modules making up IceCube.

The signals from the PMTs are digitized and then sent to the surface of the glacier on a cable. These signals are collected in a surface counting house, and some of them are sent north via satellite for further analysis. Since 2014, hard drives rather than tape store the balance of the data which is sent north once a year via ship. Once the data reaches experimenters, they can reconstruct [[kinematical]] parameters of the incoming neutrino. High-energy neutrinos may cause a large signal in the detector, pointing back to their origin. Clusters of such neutrino directions indicate point sources of neutrinos.

Each of the above steps requires a certain minimum energy, and thus IceCube is sensitive mostly to high energy neutrinos, in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; to about 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]].&lt;ref name=hlz-nrc&gt;

IceCube is more sensitive to [[muon]]s than other charged leptons, because they are the most penetrating and thus have the longest tracks in the detector. Thus, of the neutrino flavors, IceCube is most sensitive to [[muon neutrino]]s. An [[electron]] resulting from an [[electron neutrino]] event typically [[scattering|scatters]] several times before losing enough energy to fall below the [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov]] threshold; this means that [[electron neutrino]] events cannot typically be used to point back to sources, but they are more likely to be fully contained in the detector, and thus they can be useful for energy studies. These events are more spherical, or "cascade"-like, than "[[particle track|track]]"-like; muon neutrino events are more track-like.

[[Tau lepton]]s can also create cascade events; but are short-lived and cannot travel very far before decaying, and are thus usually indistinguishable from electron cascades. A tau could be distinguished from an electron with a "double bang" event, where a cascade is seen both at the tau creation and decay. This is only possible with very high energy taus. Hypothetically, to resolve a tau track, the tau would need to travel at least from one DOM to an adjacent DOM (17&amp;nbsp;m) before decaying. As the average lifetime of a tau is {{val|2.9|e=-13|u=s}}, a tau traveling at near the speed of light would require 20&amp;nbsp;TeV of energy for every meter traveled.&lt;ref&gt;Speed of light ({{val|299792458|u=m/s}}) &amp;times; average lifetime ({{val|2.9|e=-13|u=s}}) = {{val|8.711|e=-5|u=m}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realistically, an experimenter would need more space than just one DOM to the next to distinguish two cascades, so double bang searches are centered at [[electronvolt|PeV]] scale energies. Such searches are underway but have not so far isolated a double bang event from background events.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}&lt;!-- cite ICRC? --&gt;

There is a large [[background noise|background]] of muons created not by neutrinos from astrophysical sources but by [[cosmic rays]] impacting the [[atmosphere]] above the detector. There are about 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; times more cosmic ray muons than neutrino-induced muons observed in IceCube.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Most of these can be rejected using the fact that they are traveling downwards. Most of the remaining (up-going) events are from neutrinos, but most of these neutrinos are from cosmic rays hitting the far side of the Earth; some unknown fraction may come from [[astronomical source]]s, and these neutrinos are the key to IceCube point source searches. Estimates predict the detection of about 75 upgoing neutrinos per day in the fully constructed IceCube detector. The arrival directions of these astrophysical neutrinos are the points with which the IceCube telescope maps the sky. To distinguish these two types of neutrinos statistically, the direction and energy of the incoming neutrino is estimated from its collision by-products. Unexpected excesses in energy or excesses from a given spatial direction indicate an extraterrestrial source.

==Experimental goals==

===Point sources of high energy neutrinos===
A point source of neutrinos could help explain the mystery of the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays. These cosmic rays have energies high enough that they cannot be contained by [[galactic magnetic fields]] (their [[gyroradius|gyroradii]] are larger than the radius of the galaxy), so they are believed to come from extra-galactic sources. Astrophysical events which are cataclysmic enough to create such high energy particles would probably also create high energy neutrinos, which could travel to the Earth with very little deflection, because neutrinos interact so rarely. IceCube could observe these neutrinos: its observable energy range is about 100&amp;nbsp;GeV to several PeV. The more energetic an event is, the larger volume IceCube may detect it in; in this sense, IceCube is more similar to Cherenkov telescopes like the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] (an array of Cherenkov detecting tanks) than it is to other neutrino experiments, such as [[Super-K]] (with inward-facing PMTs fixing the fiducial volume).

IceCube is more sensitive to point sources in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere. It can observe astrophysical neutrino signals from any direction, but neutrinos coming from the direction of the southern hemisphere are swamped by the cosmic-ray muon background. Thus, early IceCube point source searches focus on the northern hemisphere, and the extension to southern hemisphere point sources takes extra work.&lt;ref name=south-pntsrc&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although IceCube is expected to detect very few neutrinos (relative to the number of photons detected by more traditional telescopes), it should have very high resolution with the ones that it does find. Over several years of operation, it could produce a flux map of the northern hemisphere similar to existing maps like that of the [[cosmic microwave background]], or [[gamma ray telescope]]s, which use particle terminology more like IceCube. Likewise, [[KM3NeT]] could complete the map for the southern hemisphere.

IceCube scientists may have detected their first neutrinos on January 29, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;

===Gamma ray bursts coincident with neutrinos===
When [[proton]]s collide with one another or with [[photon]]s, the result is usually [[pion]]s.  Charged pions decay into [[muon]]s and [[muon neutrino]]s whereas neutral pions decay into [[gamma rays]].  Potentially, the neutrino flux and the gamma ray flux may coincide in certain sources such as [[gamma ray burst]]s and [[supernova remnant]]s, indicating the elusive nature of their origin.  Data from IceCube is being used in conjunction with gamma-ray satellites like 
[[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]] or [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi]] for this goal. IceCube has not observed any neutrinos in coincidence with gamma ray bursts, but is able to use this search to constrain neutrino flux to values less than those predicted by the current models.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indirect dark matter searches===
[[Weakly interacting massive particle]] (WIMP) [[dark matter]] could be gravitationally captured by massive objects like the [[Sun]] and accumulate in the [[solar core|core of the Sun]]. With a high enough density of these particles, they would [[annihilation|annihilate]] with each other at a significant rate. The decay products of this annihilation could decay into neutrinos, which could be observed by IceCube as an excess of neutrinos from the direction of the Sun. This technique of looking for the decay products of WIMP annihilation is called indirect, as opposed to direct searches which look for dark matter interacting within a contained, instrumented volume. Solar WIMP searches are more sensitive to [[spin (physics)|spin]]-dependent WIMP models than many direct searches, because the Sun is made of lighter elements than direct search detectors (e.g. [[xenon]] or [[germanium]]). IceCube has set better limits with the 22 string detector (about {{frac|1|4}} of the full detector) than the AMANDA limits.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neutrino oscillations===
IceCube can observe [[neutrino oscillation]]s from atmospheric cosmic ray showers, over a baseline across the Earth. It is most sensitive at ~25&amp;nbsp;GeV, the energy range for which the DeepCore sub-array has been optimized. DeepCore consists of 6 strings deployed in the 2009–2010 austral summer with a closer horizontal and vertical spacing. In 2014, DeepCore data was used to determine the mixing angle [[PMNS matrix|''&amp;theta;''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;.&lt;/sub&gt; As more data is collected and IceCube can refine this measurement, it may be possible to also observe the characteristic modification of the oscillation pattern at ~15&amp;nbsp;GeV that determines the neutrino [[mass hierarchy]]. This mechanism for determining the mass hierarchy only works as the mixing angle [[PMNS matrix|''&amp;theta;''&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;]] is large.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

===Galactic supernovae===
Despite the fact that individual neutrinos expected from supernovae have energies well below the IceCube energy cutoff, IceCube could detect a local supernova. It would appear as a detector-wide, brief, correlated rise in noise rates. The supernova would have to be relatively close (within our galaxy) to get enough neutrinos before the 1/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; distance dependence took over. IceCube is a member of the [[Supernova Early Warning System]] (SNEWS).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sterile neutrinos===
A signature of [[sterile neutrino]]s would be a distortion of the energy spectrum of atmospheric neutrinos around 1 TeV, for which IceCube is uniquely positioned to search. This signature would arise from matter effects as atmospheric neutrinos interact with the matter of the Earth.

The described detection strategy, along with its South Pole position, could allow the detector to provide the first robust experimental evidence of [[superstring theory|extra dimension]]s predicted in [[string theory]]. Many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, including string theory, propose a sterile neutrino; in string theory this is made from a [[closed string]].  These could leak into extra dimensions before returning, making them appear to travel faster than the speed of light.  An experiment to test this may be possible in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;

An '''interstellar object''' is a body, other than a [[star]] or [[Substellar object|substar]], that is located in [[interstellar space]] and is not [[gravitationally bound]] to a star.  The term can also be applied to objects that are on an interstellar trajectory but are temporarily passing close to a star, such as certain [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s (including [[exocomet]]s&lt;ref name="Valtonen"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Valtonen| first = Mauri J.| author2 = Jia-Qing Zheng | author3 = Seppo Mikkola| title = Origin of oort cloud comets in the interstellar space| journal = Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy| volume = 54| issue = 1–3| pages = 37–48| date = March 1992| url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/g43v16167077453u/| doi = 10.1007/BF00049542| accessdate = 2008-12-30|bibcode = 1992CeMDA..54...37V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Francis"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Francis| first = Paul J.| date  = 2005-12-20| title = The Demographics of Long-Period Comets| journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 635| issue  = 2| pages  = 1348–1361| doi  = 10.1086/497684| bibcode = 2005ApJ...635.1348F

Due to present observational difficulties, an interstellar object can usually only be detected if it passes through the [[Solar System]], where it can be distinguished by its strongly [[hyperbolic trajectory]], indicating that it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun.&lt;ref name=Francis/&gt;&lt;ref name="hyperbolics"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, gravitationally bound objects follow [[elliptic orbit]]s around the Sun, like most asteroids, comets, and objects in the [[Oort cloud]].

It is possible for objects orbiting a star to be ejected due to interaction with a third massive body, thereby becoming interstellar objects.  Such a process was initiated in early 1980s when [[C/1980 E1]], initially gravitationally bound to the Sun, passed near Jupiter and was accelerated sufficiently to reach escape velocity from the Solar System.  This changed its orbit from elliptical to hyperbolic and made it the most eccentric known object at the time, with an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 1.057.&lt;ref name="jpldata"&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is headed for interstellar space.

The first discovered, and to date only known, interstellar object is [[ʻOumuamua]] (1I/ʻOumuamua, previously called C/2017 U1 and A/2017 U1). The object has an orbital eccentricity of about 1.20. 

Recent research suggests that asteroid [[(514107) 2015 BZ509]] may be a former interstellar object, captured some 4.5 billion years ago, as evidenced by its co-orbital motion with Jupiter and its retrograde orbit around the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/05/asteroid-came-another-solar-system-and-it-s-here-stay|title=This asteroid came from another solar system—and it’s here to stay|publisher=Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
With the first discovery of an interstellar object, the IAU has proposed a new series of small-body designations for interstellar objects, the ''I numbers,'' similar to the comet numbering system. The [[Minor Planet Center]] will assign the numbers. Provisional designations for interstellar objects will be handled using the C/ or A/ prefix, (comet or asteroid) as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MPEC 2017-V17 : NEW DESIGNATION SCHEME FOR INTERSTELLAR OBJECTS|url=https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/mpec/K17/K17V17.html|publisher= minor planet center|date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current models of [[Oort cloud]] formation predict that more comets are ejected into interstellar space than are retained in the Oort cloud, with estimates varying from 3 to 100 times as many.&lt;ref name=Francis/&gt; Other simulations suggest that 90–99% of comets are ejected.&lt;ref name="Choi"&gt;{{cite web | last = Choi | first = Charles Q. | title = The Enduring Mysteries of Comets | publisher = Space.com  | url = http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/071224-mm-comet-mysteries.html  | date = 2007-12-24  | accessdate = 2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no reason to believe comets formed in other star systems would not be similarly scattered.&lt;ref name=Valtonen /&gt;

If interstellar comets exist, they must occasionally pass through the inner [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name=Valtonen /&gt; They would approach the Solar System with random velocities, mostly from the direction of the constellation [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]] because the Solar System is moving in that direction, called the [[solar apex]].&lt;ref name=Struve&gt;{{cite book | last = Struve | first = Otto | authorlink = Otto Struve | author2 = Lynds, Beverly | author3 = Pillans, Helen | title = Elementary Astronomy | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = 1959 | location = New York | pages = 150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the discovery of [['Oumuamua]], the fact that no comet with a speed greater than the [[Sun]]'s escape velocity&lt;ref name=MacRobert /&gt; had been observed was used to place upper limits to their density in interstellar space.

A dim object was discovered on October 19, 2017 by the [[Pan-STARRS]] telescope, at an apparent magnitude of 20. The observations showed that it follows a strongly hyperbolic trajectory around the Sun at a speed greater than the solar escape velocity, in turn meaning that it is not gravitationally bound to the Solar System and likely to be an interstellar object.&lt;ref name="C2017U1discovery"&gt;{{cite web|title=MPEC 2017-U181: COMET C/2017 U1 (PANSTARRS)|url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/mpec/K17/K17UI1.html|website=Minor Planet Center|publisher=International Astronomical Union|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially named C/2017 U1 because it was assumed to be a comet, and was renamed to A/2017 U1 after no cometary activity was found on October 25.&lt;ref name="A2017U1announcement"&gt;{{cite web|author=K.

The lack of [[Coma (cometary)|cometary activity]] from ʻOumuamua suggests an origin from the inner regions of whatever stellar system it came from, losing all surface volatiles within the [[Frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]], much like the rocky asteroids, [[extinct comets]] and [[damocloids]] we know from our Solar System. This is only a suggestion, as ʻOumuamua might very well have lost all surface volatiles to eons of [[cosmic radiation]] exposure in interstellar space, developing a thick crust layer after it was expelled from its parent system. 

ʻOumuamua has an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 1.199, which is the highest eccentricity ever observed for any object in the Solar System by a wide margin.

In September 2018, astronomers described several possible home [[star system]]s from which 'Oumuamua, that was detected passing through the Solar System in October 2017, may have begun its interstellar journey.&lt;ref name="ARX-20180924"&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = 1809.09009|last1 = Feng|first1 = Fabo|title = Plausible home stars of the interstellar object 'Oumuamua found in Gaia DR2|last2 = Jones|first2 = Hugh R.

Now We May Know Which Star It Came From]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, Harvard astronomers reported that there should be hundreds of 'Oumuamua-size interstellar objects in the Solar System, based on calculated orbital characteristics, and presented several known examples, namely, [[2011 SP25]], [[2017 RR2]], [[2017 SV13]], and [[2018 TL6]].&lt;ref name=MNRAS-20181129"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Siraj |first1=Amir |last2=Loeb |first2=Abraham |title=Identifying Interstellar Objects Trapped in the Solar System through Their Orbital Parameters |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.09632.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |date=29 November 2018  |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=000 |pages=1-5 |accessdate=1 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are all orbiting the sun, but with unusual orbits, and are assumed to have been trapped at some occasion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="865">An '''intracule''' is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] mathematical function for the two electron density which depends not upon the absolute values of position or momentum but rather upon their relative values. Its use is leading to new methods in [[physics]] and [[computational chemistry]] to investigate the [[electronic structure]] of molecules and solids. These methods are a development of [[Density functional theory]] (DFT), but with the two electron density replacing the one electron density.

'''NFR ([[Non-functional requirement|Non-Functional Requirements]])''' is a framework on [[Goal Modelling]]. The analysis begins with softgoals that represent NFR which stakeholders agree upon. Softgoals are goals that are hard to express, but tend to be global qualities of a software system. These could be usability, performance, security and flexibility in a given system. These softgoals are then usually decomposed and refined to uncover a tree structure of goals and subgoals for e.g. the flexibility softgoal. Once uncovering tree structures, one is bound to find interfering softgoals in different trees, e.g. security goals generally interferes with usability. These softgoal trees now form a softgoal graph structure. The final step in this analysis is to pick some particular leaf softgoals, so that all the root softgoals are satisfied.

== Measuring the Non-functional requirements ==

SNAP is the Software Non-functional Assessment Process. While Function Points measure the functional requirements by sizing the data flow through a software application, IFPUG's SNAP measures the non-functional requirements.  

The SNAP model consists of four categories and fourteen sub-categories to measure the non-functional requirements. Non-functional requirement are mapped to the relevant sub-categories. Each sub-category is sized, and the size of a requirement is the sum of the sizes of its sub-categories.

The SNAP sizing process is very similar to the Function Point sizing process.  Within the application boundary, non-functional requirements are associated with relevant categories and their sub-categories. Using a standardized set of basic criteria, each of the sub-categories is then sized according to its type and complexity; the size of such a requirement is the sum of the sizes of its sub-categories.  These sizes are then totaled to give the measure of non-functional size of the software application.

Beta testing of the model shows that SNAP size has a strong correlation with the work effort required to develop the non-functional portion of the software application.

==Design==
[[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] from design company John Doe designed Olli from the basic shape of a [[soccer ball]]. They believe the basic shape, size and character was part of Olli's success. This made Olli easily recognizable to audiences. Olli is drawn in a minimalist style, requiring only a few lines and one [[primary color]]. Olli was created in three sizes, one small size 4.7 in. one medium, size 11 in. and one big size 7.2&amp;nbsp;ft.

==Big Olli==
There are two big Olli's. They are the elder version of small Olli. The Big Olli's is a special creature model made for several charities. One is a permanent hard [[plastic]] [[polyester]] [[statue]] at the Sophia [[Children's hospital|Children's Hospital]] and another one has a temporarily place at the [[Rotterdam Zoo]]. The big Olli that is used in the short film to save the Rotterdam ZOO is stored at a secret location according to the creators.

==Fictional character biography==
Olli is toy elephant grown to the size of a real elephant. Olli is a lovable character with furry friends living in a [[Japan]]ese [[fantasy]] world. Later in 2013 there was a story added that he was also the favorite toy of Famous Soccer player [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]]. Together they are the main cast of a short film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fr12.nl/dump/9360-olli--amp--giovanni-van-bronckhorst.html
|title=Olli &amp; Giovanni van Bronckhorst|publisher=FR12|language=Dutch|date=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rotterdam, [[Netherlands]] of 1980, Giovanni van Bronckhorst is a little boy (played in the short film by the son of Giovanni van Bronckhorst). One day, he discovers a stuffed Elephant at the Rotterdam [[Zoo]] and immediately grows attached to it. The name of the elephant is Olli. Giovanni takes him everywhere he goes, especially when he plays soccer. One day during a soccer game, he loses Olli in the canal of Rotterdam. 28 years later in 2013, Giovanni became a Famous Soccer Player and trainer of soccer club [[Feyenoord]] and Olli, also grew big, reunite again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://christianneblogs.com/2013/03/21/olli-een-aaibare-briljante-reclame
|title=Aaibare briljante reclame|publisher=Christianne Blogs|language=Dutch|date=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] have a history in creating things that help people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fabmagazine.nl/2014/03/wereldheerschappij-voor-rotterdamse-olli|title=Wereldheerschappij voor Rotterdamse Olli|publisher=FAB|language=Dutch|date=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To give something back to society and convince big brands to do so too. Olli was a few times part of a strategy they developed in 2004 and created Olli as a separate brand to generate [[awareness]] and in one campaign to generate more traffic and money for a [[ZOO]] in [[Rotterdam]].

==Awards==
In December 2013 [[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] of John Doe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1041/Amsterdam/article/detail/2215767/2007/06/26/John-Doe-Amsterdam-grossiert-in-prijzen.dhtml|title=John Doe grossiert in prijzen|publisher=Algemeen Dagblad|language=Dutch|date= 26 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; got awarded with the highest Dutch advertising award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/22154615/__Olli_wint_Gouden_Loeki__.html|title=Olli wint Gouden Loeki|publisher=Telegraaf|language=Dutch|date= 19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2664/Nieuws/article/detail/3565250/2013/12/19/Reclamespot-Olli-wint-Gouden-Loeki.dhtml|title=Olli wint Gouden Loeki|publisher=Volkskrant|language=Dutch|date= 19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reclamewereld.blog.nl/reclameprijzen/2013/12/19/gouden-loeki-2013-asrolli-met-reclamebureau-john-doe|title=Gouden Loeki 2013: Olli met reclamebureau John Doe|publisher=Reclamewereld|language=Dutch|date= 19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Golden Loeki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welovereclame.nl/gouden-loeki|title=Gouden Loeki Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; for this [[Advertising campaign|campaign]]. The agency John Doe got the award in a [[Live television]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.show.nl/rubrieken/televisie/reclamespot-olli-wint-gouden-loekie/|title=Olli wint gouden Loeki|publisher=Show News|language=Dutch|date= 19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; show from Arian Buurman, CEO of the [[Stichting Ether Reclame]] who hosts the Loeki awards.

==Sales==
In 2013 Olli was used to help and save the Rotterdam zoo to generate money after the zoo lost government [[funding]]. In one year over 200.000 Olli's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.ad.nl/ad/nl/1038/Rotterdam/article/detail/3555615/2013/12/03/Knuffelolifantje-Olli-reddende-engel-diergaarde-Blijdorp.dhtml

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ollimania.com/en/about-ollimania-license/|title=Olli licensing|language=Dutch|date=Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; brand for a large range of products and always attached to a good cause. In 2015 Ollimania sold over a million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ollimania.com/en/about-ollimania-license|title=Ollimania license|publisher=JohnDoe BV|date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of their licensed products.

==Charity==
Ollimania is always involved with giving back to the community.  Ollimania works with local charity organizations as well as collaborating on common projects, fund‐raisings and social activities. In 2013 Ollimania saved a historic Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BG_7Lm-CIAE1Fj7.jpg:large|title=Olli de vredesduif|publisher=AD|date= March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Ollimania brings its stuffed toy characters to children hospitals, where he interact with little patients by distributing Ollimania presents, reading out Ollimania stories, taking pictures and even organizing birthday celebrations for the most needing ones and their families. On September 10, 2015, Ollimania and its creators [[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] donated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rijnmond.nl/nieuws/10-09-2015/sophia-kinderziekenhuis-verwelkomt-olli-de-olifant|title=Sophia Kinderziekenhuis verwelkomt Olli de olifant|publisher=RTV Rijnmond|language=Dutch|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a huge Olli [[statue]] to the Sophia [[Children's hospital|Children’s Hospital]] in [[Rotterdam]]. They did this to give a smile &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metronieuws.nl/binnenland/rotterdam/2015/09/iedereen-is-blij-met-olli-in-de-hal-van-het-sophia|title=Iedereen is blij met Olli|publisher=Metro|language=Dutch|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the little patients and parents in the hospital. This original big Olli is there to stay.

== copyright infringement ==
In 2015 John Doe BV/Ollimania started a lawsuit against the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] insurance company [[ASR Nederland]] for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ie-forum.nl/?//ASR+mag+Olli-producten+na+afloop+licentieovereenkomst+blijven+uitleveren////34043/|title=John Doe BV Olli|publisher=IE Forum |date= 30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch [[Insurance]] company used illegally images and foto’s from Ollimania to sell insurances to their customers. The Dutch court ruled in favor of John Doe BV/ Ollimania and urged ASR Nederland to stop their [[copyright infringement]].
[[ASR Nederland]] had a license for a year on one of the Olli toys that expired in August 2014. The insurance company also kept 30.000 toys that were meant for the Rotterdam zoo to earn [[money]] to keep the [[ZOO]] open. [[ASR Nederland]] was entitled to keep the toys and distribute them however they see fit as long they would not infringe the copyrights of John Doe BV and Olli again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.ie-forum.nl/?//ASR+mag+Olli-producten+na+afloop+licentieovereenkomst+blijven+uitleveren////34043/|title=ASR en Olli|publisher=Reclameboek|date= 30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASR Nederland is the biggest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.slimmeropweg.nl/het-nieuwe-werken-stappenplan/gerelateerd-nieuws/item/asr-het-nieuwe-generatie-werken|title=Het nieuwe werken|publisher=Slimmer op weg|date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; insurance company of the Netherlands with almost 3000 [[employees]]. [[Hein Mevissen]], the [[artist]] and creator of Olli urged the insurance company to look in their hearts and give the [[toys]] back to the ZOO where they belong.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4220">The '''pair distribution function''' describes the distribution of distances between pairs of particles contained within a given volume.&lt;ref name="globalsino"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsino.com/EM/page3097.html|accessdate=2018-10-26|title=Pair Distribution Function (PDF) Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematically, if ''a'' and ''b'' are two particles in a fluid, the pair distribution function of ''b'' with respect to ''a'', denoted by &lt;math&gt;g_{ab}(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of finding the particle ''b'' at distance &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}&lt;/math&gt; from ''a'', with ''a'' taken as the origin of coordinates.

== Overview ==
The pair distribution function is used to describe the distribution of objects within a medium (for example, oranges in a crate or nitrogen molecules in a gas cylinder).  If the medium is homogeneous (i.e. every spatial location has identical properties), then there is an equal probability density for finding an object at any position &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;p(\vec{r})=1/V&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the container.  On the other hand, the likelihood of finding ''pairs of objects'' at given positions (i.e. the two-body probability density) is not uniform.  For example, pairs of hard balls must be separated by at least the diameter of a ball.  The pair distribution function &lt;math&gt;g(\vec{r},\vec{r}')&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by scaling the two-body probability density function by the total number of objects &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and the size of the container:
:&lt;math&gt;g(\vec{r}, \vec{r}') = p(\vec{r},\vec{r}') V^2 \frac{N-1}{N}&lt;/math&gt;.
In the common case where the number of objects in the container is large, this simplifies to give:
:&lt;math&gt;g(\vec{r}, \vec{r}') \approx p(\vec{r},\vec{r}') V^2&lt;/math&gt;.

== Simple models and general properties ==
The simplest possible pair distribution function assumes that all object locations are mutually independent, giving:
:&lt;math&gt;g(\vec{r})=1&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the separation between a pair of objects.  However, this is inaccurate in the case of hard objects as discussed above, because it does not account for the minimum separation required between objects.  The hole-correction (HC) approximation provides a better model:
:&lt;math&gt;g(r) = 
\begin{cases}
  0,&amp;r&lt;b,\\
  1,&amp;r\geq{}b
\end{cases},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter of one of the objects.

Although the HC approximation gives a reasonable description of sparsely packed objects, it breaks down for dense packing.  This may be illustrated by considering a box completely filled by identical hard balls so that each ball touches its neighbours.  In this case, every pair of balls in the box is separated by a distance of exactly &lt;math&gt;r=nb&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a positive whole number.  The pair distribution for a volume completely filled by hard spheres is therefore a set of [[Dirac delta function]]s of the form:
:&lt;math&gt;g(r)=\sum\limits_i\delta(r-ib)&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally, it may be noted that a pair of objects which are separated by a large distance have no influence on each other's position (provided that the container is not completely filled).  Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits_{r\to\infty}g(r) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

In general, a pair distribution function will take a form somewhere between the sparsely packed (HC approximation) and the densely packed (delta function) models, depending on the packing density &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

== Radial distribution function ==
Of special practical importance is the [[radial distribution function]], which is independent of orientation. It is a major descriptor for the atomic structure of amorphous materials (glasses, polymers) and liquids. The radial distribution function can be calculated directly from physical measurements like [[light scattering]] or [[x-ray powder diffraction]] through the use of [[Fourier Transform]].

In Statistical Mechanics the PDF is given by the expression:

&lt;math&gt;
g_{ab}(r) = \frac{1}{N_{a} N_b}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_a} \sum\limits_{j=1}^{N_b} \langle \delta( \vert \mathbf{r}_{ij} \vert -r)\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

The word ''pedophilia'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] παῖς, παιδός (''paîs, paidós''), meaning "child", and φιλία (''[[Philia|philía]]''), "friendly love" or "friendship".&lt;ref name="Liddell, H.G. 1959"&gt;{{cite book|first1=H.G.|last1=Liddell|first2=Robert|last2=Scott|title=Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford At The Clarendon Press]]|location=Oxford, England|date=1959|ISBN=0-19-910206-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pedophilia'' is used for individuals with a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children aged 13 or younger.&lt;ref name="DSM 5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ICD-10" /&gt;
''Infantophilia'' is a sub-type of pedophilia; it is used to refer to a sexual preference for children under the age of 5 (especially [[infant]]s and [[toddler]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David M.|last1=Greenberg|first2=John|last2=Bradford|first3=Susan|last3=Curry|title=Infantophilia--a new subcategory of pedophilia?: a preliminary study |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4721/444e410960fc51ef6eaea13a15300b968973.pdf|journal=The Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law |publisher=American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law |location=Bloomfield, Connecticut|volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=63–71 |date=1995 |pmid=7599373 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mayoclinic" /&gt;  This is sometimes referred to as ''nepiophilia'' (from the {{lang-el|νήπιος}} (''népios'') meaning "infant" or "child," which in turn derives from "ne-" and "epos" meaning "not speaking"), though this term is rarely used in academic sources.&lt;ref name="Goode2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=Sarah D.|last=Goode|title=Understanding and Addressing Adult Sexual Attraction to Children: A Study of Paedophiles in Contemporary Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNKOAgAAQBAJ|date=2009|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|isbn=978-1-135-25804-7|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1= D.

==Signs and symptoms==

===Development and sexual orientation===
Pedophilia emerges before or during puberty, and is stable over time.&lt;ref name="cutler"&gt;{{cite book | author = Cutler, Brian L. | title = Encyclopedia of Psychology and Law | publisher = SAGE | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-4129-5189-0 | p = 549}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is self-discovered, not chosen.&lt;ref name="faganJAMA" /&gt; For these reasons, pedophilia has been described as a disorder of sexual preference, phenomenologically similar to a heterosexual or homosexual sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="cutler" /&gt; These observations, however, do not exclude pedophilia from the group of mental disorders because pedophilic acts cause harm, and mental health professionals can sometimes help pedophiles to refrain from harming children.&lt;ref name="Berlin"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Fred S. | last = Berlin | title = Treatments to Change Sexual Orientation | journal = [[American Journal of Psychiatry]] | publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|location=Washington, DC|date = 2000 | volume = 157 | issue = 5 | pages = 838-838 | accessdate = December 10, 2014 | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=174135 | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.157.5.838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to misinterpretations that the [[American Psychiatric Association]] considers pedophilia a sexual orientation because of wording in its printed DSM-5 manual, which distinguishes between [[paraphilia]] and what it calls "paraphilic disorder", subsequently forming a division of "pedophilia" and "pedophilic disorder", the association commented: "'[S]exual orientation' is not a term used in the diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder and its use in the DSM-5 text discussion is an error and should read 'sexual interest.'" They added, "In fact, APA considers pedophilic disorder a 'paraphilia,' not a 'sexual orientation.' This error will be corrected in the electronic version of DSM-5 and the next printing of the manual." They said they strongly support efforts to criminally prosecute those who sexually abuse and exploit children and adolescents, and "also support continued efforts to develop treatments for those with pedophilic disorder with the goal of preventing future acts of abuse."&lt;ref name="Wetzstein"&gt;{{cite news| first=Cheryl | last=Wetzstein| title=APA to correct manual: Pedophilia is not a ‘sexual orientation’|work=[[The Washington Times]]|publisher=Washington Times LLC|location=Washington DC|date=October 31, 2013|accessdate=February 14, 2014|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/31/apa-correct-manual-clarification-pedophilia-not-se/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comorbidity and personality traits===
Studies of pedophilia in child sex offenders often report that it co-occurs with other [[psychopathology|psychopathologies]], such as low [[self-esteem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marshall WL | title = The relationship between self-esteem and deviant sexual arousal in nonfamilial child molesters | journal = Behavior Modification | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 86–96 | year = 1997 | pmid = 8995044 | doi = 10.1177/01454455970211005 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; depression, anxiety, and personality problems. It is not clear whether these are features of the disorder itself, artifacts of sampling bias, or consequences of being identified as a sex offender.&lt;ref name="setocomorbidity" /&gt; One review of the literature concluded that research on personality correlates and psychopathology in pedophiles is rarely methodologically correct, in part owing to confusion between pedophiles and child sex offenders, as well as the difficulty of obtaining a representative, community sample of pedophiles.&lt;ref&gt;Okami, P. &amp; Goldberg, A. (1992). "Personality Correlates of Pedophilia: Are They Reliable Indicators?", ''Journal of Sex Research'', Vol. 29, No. 3, pp. 297–328. "For example, because an unknown percentage of true pedophiles may never act on their impulses or may never be arrested, forensic samples of sex offenders against minors clearly do not represent the population of "pedophiles", and many such persons apparently do not even belong to the population of "pedophiles"."&lt;/ref&gt; Seto (2004) points out that pedophiles who are available from a clinical setting are likely there because of distress over their sexual preference or pressure from others. This increases the likelihood that they will show psychological problems. Similarly, pedophiles recruited from a correctional setting have been convicted of a crime, making it more likely that they will show anti-social characteristics.&lt;ref name="seto2004" /&gt;

Impaired self-concept and interpersonal functioning were reported in a sample of child sex offenders who met the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia by Cohen et al. (2002), which the authors suggested could contribute to motivation for pedophilic acts. The pedophilic offenders in the study had elevated [[psychopathy]] and cognitive distortions compared to healthy community controls. This was interpreted as underlying their failure to inhibit their criminal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cohen LJ, McGeoch PG, Watras-Gans S, Acker S, Poznansky O, Cullen K, Itskovich Y, Galynker I | title = Personality impairment in male pedophiles | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 63 | issue = 10 | pages = 912–9 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12416601 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v63n1009 | url = http://www.psychiatrist.com/privatepdf/2002/v63n10/v63n1009.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in 2009 and 2012 found that non-pedophilic child sex offenders exhibited psychopathy, but pedophiles did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Strassberg, Donald S., Eastvold, Angela, Kenney, J. Wilson, Suchy, Yana | title = Psychopathy among pedophilic and nonpedophilic child molesters | journal = Child Abuse &amp; Neglect | volume = 36 | pages =  379–382 | year = 2012 | doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2011.09.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Suchy, Yana |author2=Whittaker, Wilson J. |author3=Strassberg, Donald S. |author4=Eastvold, Angela | title = Facial and prosodic affect recognition among pedophilic and nonpedophilic criminal child molesters | journal = Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 93–110 | year = 2009 | doi=10.1177/1079063208326930}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Wilson and Cox (1983) studied the characteristics of a group of pedophile club members. The most marked differences between pedophiles and controls were on the introversion scale, with pedophiles showing elevated shyness, sensitivity and depression. The pedophiles scored higher on [[neuroticism]] and [[psychoticism]], but not enough to be considered pathological as a group. The authors caution that "there is a difficulty in untangling cause and effect. We cannot tell whether paedophiles gravitate towards children because, being highly introverted, they find the company of children less threatening than that of adults, or whether the social withdrawal implied by their introversion is a result of the isolation engendered by their preference i.e., awareness of the social [dis]approbation and hostility that it evokes" (p.&amp;nbsp;324).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wilson G. D. |author2=Cox D.

A review of qualitative research studies published between 1982 and 2001 concluded that child sexual abusers use [[cognitive distortion]]s to meet personal needs, justifying abuse by making excuses, redefining their actions as love and mutuality, and exploiting the power imbalance inherent in all adult–child relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lawson L | title = Isolation, gratification, justification: offenders' explanations of child molesting | journal = Issues in Mental Health Nursing | volume = 24 | issue = 6–7 | pages = 695–705 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12907384 | doi=10.1080/01612840305328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cognitive distortions include the idea of "children as sexual beings", uncontrollability of sexual behavior, and "sexual entitlement-bias".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mihailides S, Devilly GJ, Ward T | title = Implicit cognitive distortions and sexual offending | journal = Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 333–350 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15560415 | doi = 10.1177/107906320401600406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child pornography===
Consumption of [[child pornography]] is a more reliable indicator of pedophilia than molesting a child,&lt;ref name="setocp" /&gt; although some non-pedophiles also view child pornography.&lt;ref name="lanning79"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Child Molesters: A Behavioral Analysis, Fifth Edition |first=Kenneth V. |last=Lanning |year=2010 |publisher=National Center for Missing and Exploited Children |url=http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/publications/NC70.pdf |page=79 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224092439/http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/publications/NC70.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Child pornography may be used for a variety of purposes, ranging from private sexual gratification or trading with other collectors, to preparing children for sexual abuse as part of the [[child grooming]] process.&lt;ref name=CrossonTower208&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding child abuse and neglect  |first=Cynthia |last=Crosson-Tower |isbn=0-205-40183-X |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon |year=2005|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wortley14&gt;{{cite journal |title=Child Pornography on the Internet |author1=Richard Wortley |author2=Stephen Smallbone |journal=Problem-Oriented Guides for Police |volume=No. 41 |pages=14–16 |url=http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/Publications/e04062000.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107070400/http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/Publications/e04062000.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Levesque64&gt;{{cite book |title=Sexual Abuse of Children: A Human Rights Perspective |first=Roger J.

Pedophilic viewers of child pornography are often obsessive about collecting, organizing, categorizing, and labeling their child pornography collection according to age, gender, sex act and fantasy.&lt;ref name=CrossonTower200&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding child abuse and neglect |first=Cynthia |last=Crosson-Tower |isbn=0-205-40183-X |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon |year=2005|pages=198–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to FBI agent Ken Lanning, "collecting" pornography does not mean that they merely view pornography, but that they save it, and "it comes to define, fuel, and validate their most cherished sexual fantasies".&lt;ref name="lanning79" /&gt; Lanning states that the collection is the single best indicator of what the offender wants to do, but not necessarily of what has or will be done.&lt;ref name="lanning107"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Child Molesters: A Behavioral Analysis, Fifth Edition |first=Kenneth V. |last=Lanning |year=2010 |publisher=National Center for Missing and Exploited Children |url=http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/publications/NC70.pdf |page=107 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224092439/http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/publications/NC70.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers Taylor and Quayle reported that pedophilic collectors of child pornography are often involved in anonymous internet communities dedicated to extending their collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Quayle, E.  |author2=Taylor, M. | year = 2002 | title = Child pornography and the internet: Assessment Issues | journal = British Journal of Social Work | volume = 32 | page = 867 | doi=10.1093/bjsw/32.7.863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Although what causes pedophilia is not yet known, researchers began reporting a series of findings [[association (statistics)|linking]] pedophilia with brain structure and function, beginning in 2002.

Such studies suggest that there are one or more neurological characteristics present at birth that cause or increase the likelihood of being pedophilic.

Blanchard, Cantor, and Robichaud (2006) reviewed the research that attempted to identify [[hormone|hormonal]] aspects of pedophiles.&lt;ref name = Blanchard2006&gt;Blanchard, R., Cantor, J. M., &amp; Robichaud, L. K. (2006). Biological factors in the development of sexual deviance and aggression in males. In {{cite book|author1=Howard E. Barbaree|author2=William L.

While not causes of pedophilia themselves, [[Child abuse|childhood abuse]] by adults or [[comorbidity|comorbid]] psychiatric illnesses—such as [[personality disorder]]s and [[substance abuse]]—are risk factors for acting on pedophilic urges.&lt;ref name=faganJAMA&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fagan PJ, Wise TN, Schmidt CW, Berlin FS | title = Pedophilia | journal = JAMA | volume = 288 | issue = 19 | pages = 2458–65 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12435259 | doi = 10.1001/jama.288.19.2458 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12435259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanchard, Cantor, and Robichaud addressed comorbid psychiatric illnesses that, "The theoretical implications are not so clear.

A study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 heterosexual men by using the Wilson Sex Fantasy Questionnaire exam determined that males with a pronounced degree of [[Paraphilia|paraphilic]] interest (including pedophilia) had a greater number of older brothers, a high 2D:4D [[digit ratio]] (which would indicate low prenatal [[androgen]] exposure), and an elevated probability of being [[Left-handedness|left-handed]], suggesting that disturbed hemispheric [[Lateralization of brain function|brain lateralization]] may play a role in deviant attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rahman Q, Symeonides DJ | title = Neurodevelopmental Correlates of Paraphilic Sexual Interests in Men | journal = [[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 166–172 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 18074220 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-007-9255-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

===DSM and ICD-11===
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5) has a significantly larger diagnostic features section for pedophilia than the previous DSM version, the [[DSM-IV-TR]], and states, "The diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder are intended to apply both to individuals who freely disclose this paraphilia and to individuals who deny any sexual attraction to prepubertal children (generally age 13 years or younger), despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary."&lt;ref name="DSM 5"/&gt; Like the DSM-IV-TR, the manual outlines specific criteria for use in the diagnosis of this disorder. These include the presence of sexually arousing fantasies, behaviors or urges that involve some kind of sexual activity with a prepubescent child (with the diagnostic criteria for the disorder extending the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13) for six months or more, or that the subject has acted on these urges or suffers from distress as a result of having these feelings. The criteria also indicate that the subject should be 16 or older and that the child or children they fantasize about are at least five years younger than them, though ongoing sexual relationships between a 12- to 13-year-old and a late adolescent are advised to be excluded. A diagnosis is further specified by the sex of the children the person is attracted to, if the impulses or acts are limited to [[incest]], and if the attraction is "exclusive" or "nonexclusive".&lt;ref name="DSM 5"/&gt;

The [[ICD-10]] defines pedophilia as "a sexual preference for children, boys or girls or both, usually of prepubertal or early pubertal age".&lt;ref name="WHOPaedophilia"&gt;See section F65.4 Paedophilia. {{Cite web|title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) Version for 2010|publisher=[[ICD-10]]|accessdate=November 17, 2012|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F65.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the DSM, this system's criteria require that the person be at least 16 years of age or older before being diagnosed as a pedophile. The person must also have a persistent or predominant sexual preference for prepubescent children at least five years younger than them.&lt;ref name=ICD-10/&gt; The [[ICD-11]] defines pedophilic disorder as a "sustained, focused, and intense pattern of sexual arousal—as manifested by persistent sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, or behaviours—involving pre-pubertal children."&lt;ref name=ICD-11/&gt; It also states that for a diagnosis of pedophilic disorder, "the individual must have acted on these thoughts, fantasies or urges or be markedly distressed by them. This diagnosis does not apply to sexual behaviours among pre- or post-pubertal children with peers who are close in age."&lt;ref name=ICD-11/&gt;

Several terms have been used to distinguish "true pedophiles" from non-pedophilic and non-exclusive offenders, or to distinguish among types of offenders on a continuum according to strength and exclusivity of pedophilic interest, and motivation for the offense (see [[Child sexual abuse#Offenders|child sexual offender types]]). Exclusive pedophiles are sometimes referred to as ''true pedophiles.'' They are sexually attracted to prepubescent children, and only prepubescent children. Showing no erotic interest in adults, they can only become sexually aroused while fantasizing about or being in the presence of prepubescent children, or both.&lt;ref name=psychiatrictimes.com/&gt; Non-exclusive offenders—or "non-exclusive pedophiles"—may at times be referred to as ''non-pedophilic'' offenders, but the two terms are not always synonymous. Non-exclusive offenders are sexually attracted to both children and adults, and can be sexually aroused by both, though a sexual preference for one over the other in this case may also exist. If the attraction is a sexual preference for prepubescent children, such offenders are considered pedophiles in the same vein as exclusive offenders.&lt;ref name="WHOPaedophilia"/&gt;&lt;ref name=psychiatrictimes.com/&gt;

Neither the DSM nor the ICD-11 diagnostic criteria require actual sexual activity with a prepubescent youth. The diagnosis can therefore be made based on the presence of fantasies or sexual urges even if they have never been acted upon. On the other hand, a person who acts upon these urges yet experiences no distress about their fantasies or urges can also qualify for the diagnosis. ''Acting'' on sexual urges is not limited to overt sex acts for purposes of this diagnosis, and can sometimes include [[indecent exposure]], [[voyeurism|voyeuristic]] or [[frotteurism|frotteuristic]] behaviors,&lt;ref name="DSM 5"/&gt; or masturbating to [[child pornography]].&lt;ref name="setocp"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Seto MC, Cantor JM, Blanchard R | title = Child pornography offenses are a valid diagnostic indicator of pedophilia | journal = J Abnorm Psychol | volume = 115 | issue = 3 | pages = 610–5 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16866601 | doi = 10.1037/0021-843X.115.3.610 | quote = The results suggest child pornography offending is a stronger diagnostic indicator of pedophilia than is sexually offending against child victims }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, these behaviors need to be considered in-context with an element of clinical judgment before a diagnosis is made. Likewise, when the patient is in late adolescence, the age difference is not specified in hard numbers and instead requires careful consideration of the situation.&lt;ref name=DSMmedem&gt;[http://www.medem.com/MedLB/article_detaillb.cfm?article_ID=ZZZUZRUZGLC&amp;sub_cat=355 ''Pedophilia''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508052445/http://www.medem.com/MedLB/article_detaillb.cfm?article_ID=ZZZUZRUZGLC&amp;sub_cat=355 |date=2006-05-08 }} DSM at the Medem Online Medical Library&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ego-dystonic sexual orientation]] ({{ICD10|F|66|1|f|60}}) includes people who acknowledge that they have a sexual preference for prepubertal children, but wish to change it due to the associated psychological or behavioral problems (or both).

===Debate regarding criteria===
The DSM-IV-TR criteria was criticized simultaneously for being over-inclusive, as well as under-inclusive.&lt;ref name=Studer&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Studer LH, Aylwin AS | title = Pedophilia: The problem with diagnosis and limitations of CBT in treatment | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 67 | issue = 4 | pages = 774–781 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16766133 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2006.04.030 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though most researchers distinguish between child molesters and pedophiles,&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt;&lt;ref name=Studer/&gt; Studer and Aylwin argue that the DSM criteria are over-inclusive because all acts of child molestation warrant the diagnosis. A child molester satisfies criteria A because of the behavior involving sexual activity with prepubescent children and criteria B because the individual has acted on those urges.&lt;ref name=Studer/&gt; Furthermore, they argue that it also is under-inclusive in the case of individuals who do not act upon it and are not distressed by it.&lt;ref name=Studer/&gt; The latter point has also been made by several other researchers who have remarked that a so-called "contented pedophile"—an individual who fantasizes about having sex with a child and masturbates to these fantasies, but does not commit child sexual abuse, and who does not feel subjectively distressed afterward—does not meet the DSM-IV-TR criteria for pedophilia, because this person does not meet Criterion B.&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Donohue W, Regev LG, Hagstrom A | title = Problems with the DSM-IV diagnosis of pedophilia | journal = Sex Abuse | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–105 | year = 2000| pmid = 10872239 | doi = 10.1023/A:1009586023326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greenpedo"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Green R | year = 2002 | title = Is pedophilia a mental disorder? | url = http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/BIB/pedophilia.htm | journal = [[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] | volume = 31 | issue =  | pages = 467–471| doi = 10.1023/a:1020699013309 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101012005114/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/BIB/pedophilia.htm | archivedate = 2010-10-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DiagnosticCompare&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moulden HM, Firestone P, Kingston D, Bradford J | year = 2009 | title = Recidivism in pedophiles: an investigation using different diagnostic methods | journal = Journal of Forensic Psychiatry &amp; Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 680–701 | doi=10.1080/14789940903174055}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large-scale survey about usage of different classification systems showed that the DSM classification is only rarely used.

[[Ray Blanchard]], an [[Canadians of American origin|American-Canadian]] [[Sexology|sexologist]] known for his research studies on pedophilia, addressed (in his literature review for the DSM-5) the aforementioned objections to the DSM-IV-TR, and proposed a general solution applicable to all paraphilias. This meant namely a distinction between ''paraphilia'' and ''paraphilic disorder''. The latter term is proposed to identify the diagnosable mental disorder which meets Criterion A and B, whereas an individual who does not meet Criterion B can be ascertained but ''not'' diagnosed as having a paraphilia.&lt;ref name="pmid19757012"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Blanchard R | title = The DSM diagnostic criteria for pedophilia | journal = Arch Sex Behav | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 304–16 |date=April 2010  | pmid = 19757012 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-009-9536-0 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanchard and a number of his colleagues also proposed that hebephilia become a diagnosable mental disorder under the DSM-5 to resolve the physical development overlap between pedophilia and hebephilia by combining the categories under ''pedophilic disorder'', but with specifiers on which age range (or both) is the primary interest.&lt;ref name="dsm5.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchard&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blanchard R, Lykins AD, Wherrett D, Kuban ME, Cantor JM, Blak T, Dickey R, Klassen PE | title = Pedophilia, Hebephilia, and the DSM-V | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 335–350 | year = 2009 | pmid = 18686026 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9399-9 | url = https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10508-008-9399-9 | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal for hebephilia was rejected by the American Psychiatric Association,&lt;ref name=prnsdhebephilia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/witness/201212/psychiatry-rejects-novel-sexual-disorder-hebephilia |title=Psychiatry Rejects Novel Sexual Disorder "Hebephilia" |author=Karen Franklin |date=2 December 2012 |publisher=Psychology Today |location=USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the distinction between ''paraphilia'' and ''paraphilic disorder'' was implemented.&lt;ref name="DSM 5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dsm5.org Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paraphilic Disorders |year=2013 |accessdate=July 8, 2013 |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Publishing]] |url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Paraphilic%20Disorders%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724010712/https://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Paraphilic%20Disorders%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |archivedate=July 24, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Psychiatric Association stated that "[i]n the case of pedophilic disorder, the notable detail is what wasn't revised in the new manual. Although proposals were discussed throughout the DSM-5 development process, diagnostic criteria ultimately remained the same as in DSM-IV TR" and that "[o]nly the disorder name will be changed from pedophilia to pedophilic disorder to maintain consistency with the chapter’s other listings."&lt;ref name= "dsm5.org Fact Sheet"/&gt; If hebephilia had been accepted as a DSM-5 diagnosable disorder, it would have been similar to the ICD-10 definition of pedophilia that already includes early pubescents,&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt; and would have raised the minimum age required for a person to be able to be diagnosed with pedophilia from 16 years to 18 years (with the individual needing to be at least 5 years older than the minor).&lt;ref name="dsm5.org"/&gt;

O'Donohue, however, suggests that the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia be simplified to the attraction to children alone if ascertained by self-report, laboratory findings, or past behavior. He states that any sexual attraction to children is pathological and that distress is irrelevant, noting "this sexual attraction has the potential to cause significant harm to others and is also not in the best interests of the individual."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = O'Donohue W | title = A critique of the proposed DSM-V diagnosis of pedophilia | journal = Arch Sex Behav | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 587–90 | date = Jun 2010 | pmid = 20204487 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-010-9604-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also arguing for behavioral criteria in defining pedophilia, Howard E. Barbaree and [[Michael C. Seto]] disagreed with the American Psychiatric Association's approach in 1997 and instead recommended the use of actions as the sole criterion for the diagnosis of pedophilia, as a means of [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] simplification.&lt;ref name="barbaree-seto"&gt;Barbaree, H. E., and Seto, M. C. (1997). Pedophilia: Assessment and Treatment. ''Sexual Deviance: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment''. 175-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

===General===
There is no evidence that pedophilia can be cured.&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt; Instead, most therapies focus on helping the pedophile refrain from acting on their desires.&lt;ref name=faganJAMA/&gt;&lt;ref name="SetoAhmed2014"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Seto MC, Ahmed AG |title=Treatment and management of child pornography use |journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=207–214 |year=2014 |pmid=24877707 |doi=10.1016/j.psc.2014.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some therapies do attempt to cure pedophilia, but there are no studies showing that they result in a long-term change in sexual preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Camilleri, Joseph A., and Quinsey, Vernon L. |date= 2008 | title = Sexual Deviance: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment, 2nd edition | publisher = The Guilford Press | page = 193 | chapter = Pedophilia: Assessment and Treatment | editor1-last = Laws | editor1-first = D. Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Seto]] suggests that attempts to cure pedophilia in adulthood are unlikely to succeed because its development is influenced by prenatal factors.&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt; Pedophilia appears to be difficult to alter but pedophiles can be helped to control their behavior, and future research could develop a method of prevention.&lt;ref name="berlin"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.paraphilias.com/publications/pdfs/Peer%20Comment.pdf|title=Peer Commentaries on Green (2002) and Schmidt (2002) - Pedophilia: When Is a Difference a Disorder?|first=Fred S.|last=Berlin|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=31|issue=6|date=December 2002|pages=479–480|doi=10.1023/A:1020603214218|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-12-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029223349/http://www.paraphilias.com/publications/pdfs/Peer%20Comment.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several common limitations to studies of treatment effectiveness. Most categorize their participants by behavior rather than erotic age preference, which makes it difficult to know the specific treatment outcome for pedophiles.&lt;ref name=faganJAMA/&gt; Many do not select their treatment and control groups [[Randomized controlled trial|randomly]]. Offenders who refuse or quit treatment are at higher risk of offending, so excluding them from the treated group, while not excluding those who would have refused or quit from the control group, can bias the treated group in favor of those with lower recidivism.&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rice ME, Harris GT | year = 2003 | title = The size and signs of treatment effects in sex offender therapy | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 989 | pages = 428–40 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb07323.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of treatment for non-offending pedophiles has not been studied.&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt;

===Cognitive behavioral therapy===
[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) aims to reduce attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that may increase the likelihood of sexual offenses against children. Its content varies widely between therapists, but a typical program might involve training in self-control, social competence and empathy, and use [[cognitive restructuring]] to change views on sex with children. The most common form of this therapy is [[relapse prevention]], where the patient is taught to identify and respond to potentially risky situations based on principles used for treating addictions.&lt;ref name="seto171"&gt;{{cite book |last= Seto |first= Michael |date= 2008|title= Pedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children |location= Washington, DC |publisher= American Psychological Association|page= 171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence for cognitive behavioral therapy is mixed.&lt;ref name="seto171" /&gt; A 2012 [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane Review]] of randomized trials found that CBT had no effect on risk of reoffending for contact sex offenders.&lt;ref name="cochrane"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dennis JA, Khan O, Ferriter M, Huband N, Powney MJ, Duggan C | year = 2012 | title = Psychological interventions for adults who have sexually offended or are at risk of offending | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 12 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007507.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meta-analyses in 2002 and 2005, which included both randomized and non-randomized studies, concluded that CBT reduced recidivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lösel F, Schmucker M | year = 2005 | title = The effectiveness of treatment for sexual offenders: a comprehensive meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Experimental Criminology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 117–46 | doi=10.1007/s11292-004-6466-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hanson RK, Gordon A, Harris AJ, Marques JK, Murphy W, etal | year = 2002 | title = First report of the collaborative outcome data project on the effectiveness of treatment for sex offenders | journal = Sexual Abuse | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–94 | doi=10.1177/107906320201400207}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is debate over whether non-randomized studies should be considered informative.&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt;&lt;ref name="rice2012"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Rice ME, Harris GT | year = 2012 | chapter = Treatment for adult sex offenders: may we reject the null hypothesis? | title = Handbook of Legal &amp; Ethical Aspects of Sex Offender Treatment &amp; Management |veditors=Harrison K, Rainey B | location = London | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; More research is needed.&lt;ref name="cochrane" /&gt;

===Behavioral interventions===
Behavioral treatments target sexual arousal to children, using satiation and aversion techniques to suppress sexual arousal to children and [[covert sensitization]] (or [[masturbation|masturbatory]] reconditioning) to increase sexual arousal to adults.&lt;ref name="setobehav"&gt;{{cite book |last= Seto |first= Michael |date= 2008|title= Pedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children |location= Washington, DC |publisher= American Psychological Association|page= 175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral treatments appear to have an effect on sexual arousal patterns during phallometric testing, but it is not known whether the effect represents changes in sexual interests or changes in the ability to control genital arousal during testing, nor whether the effect persists in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;Barbaree, H.

==Epidemiology==

===Pedophilia and child molestation===
The prevalence of pedophilia in the general population is not known,&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt;&lt;ref name="seto2004"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Seto MC | title = Pedophilia and sexual offenses against children | journal = Annu Rev Sex Res | volume = 15 | issue =  | pages = 321–61 | year = 2004 | pmid = 16913283 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; but is estimated to be lower than 5% among adult men.&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt; Less is known about the prevalence of pedophilia in women, but there are case reports of women with strong sexual fantasies and urges towards children.&lt;ref name="setowomen" /&gt; Most sexual offenders against children are male. Females may account for 0.4% to 4% of convicted sexual offenders, and one study estimates a 10 to 1 ratio of male-to-female child molesters.&lt;ref name=psychiatrictimes.com/&gt; The true number of female child molesters may be underrepresented by available estimates, for reasons including a "societal tendency to dismiss the negative impact of sexual relationships between young boys and adult women, as well as women's greater access to very young children who cannot report their abuse", among other explanations.&lt;ref name=psychiatrictimes.com/&gt;

The term ''pedophile'' is commonly used by the public to describe all child sexual abuse offenders.&lt;ref name="ames"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt; This usage is considered problematic by researchers, because many child molesters do not have a strong sexual interest in prepubescent children, and are consequently not pedophiles.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SetoReview/&gt;&lt;ref name=Studer/&gt; There are motives for child sexual abuse that are unrelated to pedophilia,&lt;ref name="barbaree-seto" /&gt; such as stress, marital problems, the unavailability of an adult partner,&lt;ref&gt;Howells, K.

Some pedophiles do not molest children.&lt;ref name="setovii" /&gt; Little is known about this population because most studies of pedophilia use criminal or clinical samples, which may not be representative of pedophiles in general.&lt;ref name="setononrep"&gt;{{cite book |last= Seto |first= Michael |date= 2008|title= Pedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children |location= Washington, DC |publisher= American Psychological Association|pages= 47–48, 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher Michael Seto suggests that pedophiles who commit child sexual abuse do so because of other anti-social traits in addition to their sexual attraction. He states that pedophiles who are "reflective, sensitive to the feelings of others, averse to risk, abstain from alcohol or drug use, and endorse attitudes and beliefs supportive of norms and the laws" may be unlikely to abuse children.&lt;ref name="SetoReview" /&gt; A 2015 study indicates that pedophiles who molested children are neurologically distinct from non-offending pedophiles.

According to Abel, Mittleman, and Becker&lt;ref&gt;Abel, G. G., Mittleman, M. S., &amp; Becker, J. V. (1985). "Sex offenders: Results of assessment and recommendations for treatment". In M. H. Ben-Aron, S. J. Hucker, &amp; C. D. Webster (Eds.), ''Clinical criminology: The assessment and treatment of criminal behavior'' (pp. 207–220). Toronto, Canada: M &amp; M Graphics.&lt;/ref&gt; (1985) and Ward ''et al.'' (1995), there are generally large distinctions between the characteristics of pedophilic and non-pedophilic molesters. They state that non-pedophilic offenders tend to offend at times of stress; have a later onset of offending; and have fewer, often familial, victims, while pedophilic offenders often start offending at an early age; often have a larger number of victims who are frequently extrafamilial; are more inwardly driven to offend; and have values or beliefs that strongly support an offense lifestyle. One study found that pedophilic molesters had a median of 1.3 victims for those with girl victims and 4.4 for those with boy victims.&lt;ref name="schaefer" /&gt; Child molesters, pedophilic or not, employ a variety of methods to gain sexual access to children. Some groom their victims into compliance with attention and gifts, while others use threats, alcohol or drugs, or physical force.&lt;ref name="setotactics"&gt;{{cite book |last= Seto |first= Michael |date= 2008|title= Pedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children |location= Washington, DC |publisher= American Psychological Association|pages= 64, 189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Pedophilia is believed to have occurred in humans throughout history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Seto |first= Michael |date= 2008|title= Pedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children |location= Washington, DC |publisher= American Psychological Association|page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was not formally named, defined or studied until the late 19th century. The term '''''paedophilia erotica''''' was coined in an 1896 article by the [[Vienna|Viennese]] psychiatrist [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] but does not enter the author's ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]''&lt;ref name=Krafft-Ebing&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Von Krafft-Ebing | first1 = Richard |others= Translated to English by Francis Joseph Rebman| title = Psychopathia Sexualis | year = 1922 | publisher = Medical Art Agency | location = | pages = 552–560| isbn = 1-871592-55-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until the 10th German edition.&lt;ref name="janssen"&gt;{{cite journal | last  = Janssen | first = D.F. | year = 2015 | title = "Chronophilia": Entries of Erotic Age Preference into Descriptive Psychopathology | journal = Medical History | volume = 59 | issue = 4 | pages = 575–598 | issn = 0025-7273 | doi=10.1017/mdh.2015.47 | pmid=26352305 | pmc=4595948}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of authors anticipated Krafft-Ebing's diagnostic gesture.&lt;ref name="janssen" /&gt; In ''Psychopathia Sexualis'', the term appears in a section titled "Violation of Individuals Under the Age of Fourteen", which focuses on the [[forensic psychiatry]] aspect of [[Child sexual abuse#Offenders|child sexual offenders]] in general. Krafft-Ebing describes several typologies of offender, dividing them into [[psychopathology|psychopathological]] and non-psychopathological origins, and hypothesizes several apparent causal factors that may lead to the sexual abuse of children.&lt;ref name=Krafft-Ebing/&gt;

Krafft-Ebing mentioned ''paedophilia erotica'' in a typology of "psycho-sexual perversion". He wrote that he had only encountered it four times in his career and gave brief descriptions of each case, listing three common traits:
# The individual is tainted [by heredity] (''hereditär belastete'')&lt;ref name="Roudinesco"&gt;Roudinesco, Élisabeth (2009). ''Our dark side: a history of perversion,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=W3ejX6C_qfwC&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 144.] Polity, {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4593-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The subject's primary attraction is to children, rather than adults.
# The acts committed by the subject are typically not intercourse, but rather involve inappropriate touching or manipulating the child into performing an act on the subject.

He mentions several cases of pedophilia among adult women (provided by another physician), and also considered the [[homosexuality and pedophilia|abuse of boys by homosexual men]] to be extremely rare.&lt;ref name=Krafft-Ebing/&gt; Further clarifying this point, he indicated that cases of adult men who have some medical or [[neurology|neurological]] disorder and abuse a male child are not true pedophilia and that, in his observation, victims of such men tended to be older and pubescent. He also lists ''pseudopaedophilia'' as a related condition wherein "individuals who have lost [[libido]] for the adult through masturbation and subsequently turn to children for the gratification of their sexual appetite" and claimed this is much more common.&lt;ref name=Krafft-Ebing/&gt;

Austrian neurologist [[Sigmund Freud]] briefly wrote about the topic in his 1905 book ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'' in a section titled ''The Sexually immature and Animals as Sexual objects.'' He wrote that exclusive pedophilia was rare and only occasionally were prepubescent children exclusive objects. He wrote that they usually were the subject of desire when a weak person "makes use of such substitutes" or when an uncontrollable instinct which will not allow delay seeks immediate gratification and cannot find a more appropriate object.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex Mobi Classics pages 18-20&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[neuroanatomy|neuroanatomist]] and psychiatrist [[Auguste Forel]] wrote of the phenomenon, proposing that it be referred to it as "Pederosis", the "Sexual Appetite for Children". Similar to Krafft-Ebing's work, Forel made the distinction between incidental sexual abuse by persons with [[dementia]] and other organic brain conditions, and the truly preferential and sometimes exclusive sexual desire for children. However, he disagreed with Krafft-Ebing in that he felt the condition of the latter was largely ingrained and unchangeable.&lt;ref name=Forel&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Forel  |  first1 = Auguste |others= Translated to English by C.F. Marshall, MD| title = The Sexual Question: A scientific, psychological, hygienic and sociological study for the cultured classes | year = 1908  |  publisher = Rebman | location = | pages = 254–255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''pedophilia'' became the generally accepted term for the condition and saw widespread adoption in the early 20th century, appearing in many popular [[Medical dictionary|medical dictionaries]] such as the 5th Edition of ''Stedman's'' in 1918. In 1952, it was included in the first edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic  and statistical manual of mental disorders |author=  American Psychiatric Association Committee on Nomenclature and  Statistics |year=1952 |edition= 1st|publisher=The Association |location=Washington,  D.C |page=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition and the subsequent DSM-II listed the disorder as one subtype of the classification "Sexual Deviation", but no diagnostic criteria were provided. The DSM-III, published in 1980, contained a full description of the disorder and provided a set of guidelines for diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic   and statistical manual of mental disorders |author=  American Psychiatric Association: Committee on Nomenclature and  Statistics |year=1980 |edition= 3rd|publisher=American Psychiatric Association |location=Washington, D.C |page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revision in 1987, the DSM-III-R, kept the description largely the same, but updated and expanded the diagnostic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-III-R | year = 1987 | publisher = American Psychiatric Association | location = Washington, DC  | isbn = 0-89042-018-1 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definitions===
''Pedophilia'' is not a legal term,&lt;ref name=mayoclinic/&gt; and having a sexual attraction to children is not illegal.&lt;ref name=faganJAMA/&gt; In law enforcement circles, the term ''pedophile'' is sometimes used informally to refer to any person who commits one or more sexually-based crimes that relate to [[age of consent|legally underage]] victims. These crimes may include [[child sexual abuse]], [[statutory rape]], offenses involving [[child pornography]], [[child grooming]], [[stalking]], and [[indecent exposure]]. One unit of the United Kingdom's [[Child Abuse Investigation Command]] is known as the "[[Paedophile Unit]]" and specializes in online investigations and enforcement work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Child abuse investigation impact | publisher = [[Metropolitan Police Service]] (met.police.uk) | accessdate = April 18, 2014 | url = http://www.met.police.uk/foi/pdfs/policies/child_abuse_investigation_eia2012.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140419015830/http://www.met.police.uk/foi/pdfs/policies/child_abuse_investigation_eia2012.pdf | archivedate = April 19, 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some forensic science texts, such as Holmes (2008), use the term to refer to offenders who target child victims, even when such children are not the primary sexual interest of the offender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Holmes | first1 = Ronald M. | title = Profiling Violent Crimes: An Investigative Tool | publisher = Sage Publications | isbn = 1-4129-5998-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Kenneth Lanning, however, makes a point of distinguishing between pedophiles and child molesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Child Molesters: A Behavioral Analysis, Fifth Edition |first=Kenneth V. |last=Lanning |year=2010 |publisher=National Center for Missing and Exploited Children |url=http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/publications/NC70.pdf |pages=16–17, 19–20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224092439/http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/publications/NC70.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil and legal commitment===
In the United States, following ''[[Kansas v.

In ''Kansas v. Hendricks'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] upheld as constitutional a Kansas law, the [[Sexually Violent Predator Act]], under which Hendricks, a pedophile, was found to have a "mental abnormality" defined as a "congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity which predisposes the person to commit sexually violent offenses to the degree that such person is a menace to the health and safety of others", which allowed the State to confine Hendricks indefinitely irrespective of whether the State provided any treatment to him.&lt;ref name=guilford&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guilford.com/cgi-bin/cartscript.cgi?page=etc/courts_updates.html&amp;cart_id=#part_two|title=Psychological Evaluation for the Courts, Second Edition - A Handbook for Mental Health Professionals and Lawyers - 9.04 Special Sentencing Provisions (b) Sexual Offender Statutes|publisher=Guilford.com|accessdate=2007-10-19}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6MQj-mjHgBIC&amp;pg=PA248 | title = Legal aspects of corrections management | isbn = 978-0-7637-2545-7 | author1 = Cripe | first1 = Clair A | last2 = Pearlman | first2 = Michael G | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gngG9zPmNKMC&amp;pg=PA159 | title = Inside the minds of sexual predators | isbn = 978-0-313-37960-4 | author1 = Ramsland | first1 = Katherine M | last2 = McGrain | first2 = Patrick Norman | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[United States v.

In the US, offenders with pedophilia are more likely to be recommended for civil commitment than non-pedophilic offenders. About half of committed offenders have a diagnosis of pedophilia.&lt;ref name="setocivil" /&gt; Psychiatrist [[Michael First]] writes that, since not all people with a paraphilia have difficulty controlling their behavior, the evaluating clinician must present additional evidence of volitional impairment instead of recommending commitment based on pedophilia alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = First, Michael B., Halon, Robert L. | year = 2008 | title = Use of DSM Paraphilia Diagnoses in Sexually Violent Predator Commitment Cases | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | page = 450 | url = http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/reprint/36/4/443.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===General===
Pedophilia is one of the most stigmatized mental disorders.&lt;ref name="jahnkeblind"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jahnke, S., Hoyer, J. | year = 2013 | title = Stigma against people with pedophilia: A blind spot in stigma research? | journal = International Journal of Sexual Health | volume = 25 | pages = 169–184 | doi=10.1080/19317611.2013.795921}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study reported high levels of anger, fear and social rejection towards pedophiles who have not committed a crime.&lt;ref name="jahnkesurveys"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jahnke, S., Imhoff, R., Hoyer, J. | year = 2015 | title = Stigmatization of People with Pedophilia: Two Comparative Surveys | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–34 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-014-0312-4 | pmid=24948422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors suggested such attitudes could negatively impact child sexual abuse prevention by reducing pedophiles' mental stability and discouraging them from seeking help.&lt;ref name="jahnkeblind" /&gt; According to sociologists Melanie-Angela Neuilly and Kristen Zgoba, social concern over pedophilia intensified greatly in the 1990s, coinciding with several sensational sex crimes (but a general decline in child sexual abuse rates). They found that the word ''pedophile'' appeared only rarely in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Le Monde]]'' before 1996, with zero mentions in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Neuillya, M.  |author2=Zgobab, K. | year = 2006 | title = Assessing the Possibility of a Pedophilia Panic and Contagion Effect Between France and the United States | journal = Victims &amp; Offenders | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 225–254 | doi=10.1080/15564880600626122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social attitudes towards child sexual abuse are extremely negative, with some surveys ranking it as morally worse than murder.&lt;ref name="setoviii"&gt;{{cite book |last= Seto |first= Michael |date= 2008|title= Pedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children |location= Washington, DC |publisher= American Psychological Association|page= viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early research showed that there was a great deal of misunderstanding and unrealistic perceptions in the general public about child sexual abuse and pedophiles. However, a 2004 study concluded that the public was well-informed on some aspects of these subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McCartan, K. | title = 'Here There Be Monsters': the public's perception of paedophiles with particular reference to Belfast and Leicester | journal = [[Medicine, Science and the Law]] | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 327–42 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15573972 | doi = 10.1258/rsmmsl.44.4.327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misuse of medical terminology===
The words ''pedophile'' and ''pedophilia'' are commonly used informally to describe an adult's sexual interest in pubescent or post-pubescent teenagers. The terms ''[[hebephilia]]'' or ''[[ephebophilia]]'' may be more accurate in these cases.&lt;ref name=mayoclinic/&gt;&lt;ref name="www.usccb.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{Cite web|title=Pedophilia|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/pedophilia |publisher=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''|accessdate=July 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially seen in the case of [[Mark Foley]] during the [[Mark Foley congressional page incident|congressional page incident]]. Most of the media labeled Foley a pedophile, which led David Tuller of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine to state that Foley was not a pedophile but rather an ephebophile.&lt;ref name="www.slate.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=David |last=Tuller|title=What To Call Foley. The congressman isn't a pedophile. He's an ephebophile|publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''|date=2006-10-04|accessdate=2010-10-17|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2151018/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common usage of ''pedophilia'' is to refer to the act of sexual abuse itself,&lt;ref name="setovii" /&gt; rather than the medical meaning, which is a ''preference'' for prepubescents on the part of the older individual ([[#Pedophilia and child molestation|see above]] for an explanation of the distinction).&lt;ref name="ames" /&gt;&lt;ref name=lanning3e/&gt; There are also situations where the terms are misused to refer to relationships where the younger person is an adult of legal age, but is either considered too young in comparison to their older partner, or the older partner occupies a position of authority over them.&lt;ref name="www.huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Guzzardi| first = Will| title = Andy Martin, GOP Senate Candidate, Calls Opponent Mark Kirk A "De Facto Pedophile" | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/06/andy-martin-gop-senate-ca_n_413624.html  | date = 2010-01-06| accessdate = 15 January 2010 | work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers state that the above uses of the term ''pedophilia'' are imprecise or suggest that they are best avoided.&lt;ref name="ames"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www.usccb.org"/&gt; The [[Mayo Clinic]] states that ''pedophilia'' "is not a criminal or legal term".&lt;ref name=mayoclinic/&gt;

===Anti-pedophile activism===
{{Main|Anti-pedophile activism}}
Anti-pedophile activism encompasses opposition against pedophiles, against pedophile advocacy groups, and against other phenomena that are seen as related to pedophilia, such as child pornography and child sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/programmes/global_crime_report/investigation/cybercrime2.shtml|title=Global Crime Report - INVESTIGATION - Child porn and the cybercrime treaty part 2 - BBC World Service|date=|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the direct action classified as anti-pedophile involves demonstrations against sex offenders, against pedophiles advocating for the legalization of sexual activity between adults and children, and against Internet users who solicit sex from minors.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/872436.stm Families flee paedophile protests] August 9, 2000.

'''Phase shift torque measurement''' is carried out by a [[torquemeter]] that uses a shaft connected between rotating machines such as a [[turbine]] and [[gas compressor|compressor]] or [[jet engine]] under test and a [[dynamometer]].  A gear at each end of the shaft is surrounded by a coil. The gear produces a [[sine wave]] in the coil's [[eddy current]] [[magnetic field]]. Under no load the waves are in line with each other, as a load is applied to the shaft the waves shift out of phase with each other. Using [[Young's modulus]] calculations for the [[stiffness]] of the material the load or [[torque]] through the shaft can be measured highly accurately at speeds up to 150,000 rpm and torque up to 400,000 Nm.

== History ==

PIRLS &lt;ref name="iea.nl"/&gt; provides internationally comparative data on how well children read by assessing students’ reading achievement. PIRLS collects considerable background information on how education systems provide educational opportunities to their students as well as the factors that influence how students use these opportunities. These background data include information about the following: national curriculum policies in reading; how the education system is organized to facilitate learning; students’ home environment for learning; school climate and resources; and how instruction actually occurs in classrooms. Studies of reading literacy had been conducted prior to the PIRLS study of 2001, and PIRLS is the successor to IEA studies, such as the Reading Literacy Study, that started in 1970 and continued until 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.nl/other-iea-studies|title=Other IEA studies - IEA|website=www.iea.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PIRLS study of 2001 started the trend for cyclical testing; PIRLS has a frequency of five years.  By administering the test every five years, education systems are able to monitor their children's literacy achievement over time.  The current cycle, PIRLS 2016, is the fourth cycle of the IEA PIRLS. Like the previous PIRLS cycles (conducted in 2001, 2006, and 2011), the study will also collect extensive information about home supports for literacy, curriculum and curriculum implementation, instructional practices, and school resources in each participating country.&lt;ref name="iea.nl"/&gt;

== Cycles ==

===PIRLS 2001===

The IEA Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) 2001 was the first cycle of assessments to measure trends in children's reading literacy achievement, and policy and practices related to literacy. The study examined three aspects of reading literacy: processes of comprehension, purposes for reading, and reading literacy behavior and attitudes. 35 countries took part in the first cycle where students enrolled in the fourth grade were assessed.&lt;ref name="iea.nl1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.nl/pirls-past-cycles|title=PIRLS - Past Cycles - IEA|website=www.iea.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PIRLS 2006===

PIRLS 2006 assessed a range of reading comprehension strategies for two major reading purposes: literary and informational. The student test of reading comprehension addressed four processes:

* retrieval of explicitly stated information
* making straightforward inferences
* interpreting and integrating ideas and information
* examination and evaluation of content, language, and textual elements.
For the second cycle of the study 41 countries participated assessing students of grade four. PIRLS 2006 assessed students enrolled in the fourth grade.&lt;ref name="iea.nl1"/&gt;

===PIRLS 2011===

Combining newly developed reading assessment passages and questions for 2011 with a selection of secure assessment passages and questions from 2001 and 2006, the study offered a state-of-the-art assessment of reading comprehension that allowed for measurement of changes since 2001. The international population for PIRLS 2011 consisted of students in the grade that represents four years of schooling, provided that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. In the 2011 cycle, prePIRLS (now known as PIRLS Literacy) was offered to assess basic reading skills as a bridge to PIRLS, for countries where most children are still developing fundamental reading skills at the end of the primary school cycle.&lt;ref name="iea.nl1"/&gt;

===PIRLS 2016===

PIRLS 2016 was released on December 5, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/ |title=PIRLS 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also collects extensive information about home supports for literacy, curriculum and curriculum implementation, instructional practices, and school resources in each participating country. In this cycle there were two additional initiatives: 
(1) the PIRLS Literacy assessment (earlier known as prePIRLS) is equivalent to PIRLS in scope and reflects the same conception of reading as PIRLS. Its purpose is to extend the effective measurement of reading literacy at the lower end of the achievement scale. Countries whose fourth-grade students are still developing fundamental reading skills can participate in the PIRLS Literacy assessment and still have their results reported on the PIRLS achievement scale. The reading passages and questions in common between the PIRLS Literacy and the PIRLS assessments will enable the two assessments to be linked, and their results to be compared.
(2) Initiated in 2016, ePIRLS is a computer-based reading assessment of students’ ability to acquire and use information when reading online. The assessment encompasses an engaging, simulated internet environment with authentic school-like assignments about science and social studies topics. The ePIRLS online reading achievement scale enables countries to examine their fourth-graders’ online reading performance relative to their performance on the PIRLS reading achievement scales.

In terms of trends, the PIRLS results for student achievement by country states that 18 countries had higher average achievement, 13 countries had the same average achievement, and 10 countries had lower average achievement; and girls had higher reading achievement than boys in 48 0f the 50 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/ |title= PIRLS 2016 International results in reading}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/trends-in-reading-achievement/ |title=Trends in reading results by country}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 PIRLS Encyclopedia has the Education Policy and Curriculum in Reading by country. It describes the structure of each education system, the reading curricula in the primary grades, and overall policies related to reading instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/encyclopedia/ |title=2016 PIRLS Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ten countries with the highest average reading achievement were: Russian Federation, Singapore, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Finland, Poland, Northern Ireland, Norway, Chinese Taipie, and England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/ | title= PIRLS 2016 Student Achievement Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PIRLS 2021===

[http://www.iea.nl/pirls-next-cycle PIRLS 2021] will be the fifth cycle in the PIRLS framework. IEA's PIRLS will continue to collect considerable background information from the assessed students, their parents, teachers and school principals on how education systems provide educational opportunities to their students, as well as the factors that influence how students use these opportunities. Trend results across assessments permit countries to monitor the effectiveness of their educational systems in a global context, and PIRLS 2021 marks 20 years of trends.

PIRLS 2021 evolves further from PIRLS 2016 in allowing countries to administer the full PIRLS reading assessment, including both PIRLS Informational and Literary (the previous standard PIRLS assessment), and the ePIRLS Online Informational (the previous ePIRLS), as one seamless digitally based endeavour. Countries may also select from two levels of the PIRLS assessment; providing students with an assessment experience better suited to their reading abilities increases student motivation and provides more accurate assessment data. All results will be reported on the same PIRLS achievement scale.

PIRLS 2021 thus offers three flexible options, enabling participants to select the administration path best suited to assessing their education system:(1) A new fully digital ePIRLS assessment, which integrates all aspects of PIRLS Informational, PIRLS Literary, and the ePIRLS Online Informational assessments; 2) The paper-only version of the PIRLS assessment, which is equivalent to the original pen-and-paper PIRLS standard assessment; and (3) The paper-only version of the PIRLS assessment, taken together with the ePIRLS Online Informational assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.nl/sites/default/files/publications/Electronic_versions/PIRLS%202021%20Brochure.pdf |title=Info |website=www.iea.nl |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== PIRLS assessment ==

The PIRLS study consists of a main survey that consists of a written reading comprehension test and a background questionnaire.  The PIRLS Reading Development Group (RDG) and National Research Coordinators (NRCs) from the participating countries collaborate to develop the reading assessments.  The assessment focuses on three main areas of literacy: process of comprehension, purposes for reading, and reading behaviors and attitudes.  The background questionnaire is used to determine the reading behaviors and attitudes.  The written test is designed to address the process of comprehension and the purposes for reading.  There are two purposes for reading that are examined in this study: reading for literary experience and reading to acquire and use information. Each student receives 80 minutes to complete two passages and then time to complete the survey.  There are a total of 8 passage.  Four passages are for each purpose of reading.  "With eight reading passages in total, but just two to be given to any
one student, passages and their accompanying items were assigned to student test booklets according to a matrix sampling plan. The eight passages were distributed across 10 booklets, two per booklet, so that passages were paired together in a booklet in as many different ways as possible."&lt;ref name="bc.edu"/&gt; The PIRLS target population is the grade that represents four years of schooling, counting from the first year of ISCED Level 1, which corresponds to the fourth grade in most countries. To better match the assessment to the achievement level of students, countries have the option of administering PIRLS or PIRLS Literacy at the fifth or sixth grade.

== Background questionnaire ==
Given to:

*Home/Parents—This questionnaire includes questions about "students’ early reading experiences, child-parent literacy interactions, parents’ reading habits and attitudes, home-school connections, and demographic and socioeconomic indicators."
*Students—This questionnaire includes questions about "instructional experiences, self-perception and attitudes towards reading, out-of-school reading habits, computer use, home literacy resources, and basic demographic information."
*Teachers—This questionnaire includes questions about "characteristics of the class tested, instructional activities for teaching reading, classroom resources, assessment practices, and about their education, training, and opportunities for professional development."
*Schools—This questionnaire includes questions about "enrollment and school characteristics, school organization for reading instruction, school staffing and resources, home-school connections, and the school environment."&lt;ref name="bc.edu"/&gt;

After the repair process has been completed, there is a loss in the structure or function of the injured tissue. In this type of repair, it is common that granulation tissue (stromal connective tissue) proliferates to fill the defect created by the necrotic cells. The necrotic cells are then replaced by scar tissue. | url = http://pathol.med.stu.edu.cn/pathol/listEngContent2.aspx?contentID=493 | access-date = 2012-12-07 | dead-url = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131110180450/http://pathol.med.stu.edu.cn/pathol/listEngContent2.aspx?contentID=493 | archive-date = 2013-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where after the necrotic tissue comes [[fibrosis]].&lt;ref name=InCompleteRegen/&gt; At its most elementary level, regeneration is mediated by the molecular processes of [[gene regulation]].&lt;ref name="Himeno92"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Himeno Y, Engelman RW, Good RA | title = Influence of calorie restriction on oncogene expression and DNA synthesis during liver regeneration | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 89 | issue = 12 | pages = 5497–501 | date = June 1992 | pmid = 1608960 | pmc = 49319 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.89.12.5497 | bibcode = 1992PNAS...89.5497H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant88"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bryant PJ, Fraser SE | title = Wound healing, cell communication, and DNA synthesis during imaginal disc regeneration in Drosophila | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 127 | issue = 1 | pages = 197–208 | date = May 1988 | pmid = 2452103 | doi = 10.1016/0012-1606(88)90201-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regeneration in biology, however, mainly refers to the [[Morphogenesis|morphogenic]] processes that characterize the [[phenotypic plasticity]] of [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] allowing multi-cellular organisms to repair and maintain the integrity of their physiological and morphological states. Above the genetic level, regeneration is fundamentally regulated by asexual cellular processes.&lt;ref name="Brokes08"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brockes JP, Kumar A | title = Comparative aspects of animal regeneration | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 24 | pages = 525–49 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18598212 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.24.110707.175336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regeneration is different from reproduction. For example, [[hydra (genus)|hydra]] perform regeneration but reproduce by the method of [[budding]].

The [[hydra (genus)|hydra]] and the [[planarian]] flatworm have long served as model organisms for their highly [[adaptation|adaptive]] regenerative capabilities.&lt;ref name="Sánchez00"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sánchez Alvarado A | title = Regeneration in the metazoans: why does it happen? | journal = BioEssays | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 578–90 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10842312 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(200006)22:6&lt;578::AID-BIES11&gt;3.0.CO;2-# | url = http://planaria.neuro.utah.edu/publications/BioEssays.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once wounded, their cells become activated and start to remodel tissues and organs back to the pre-existing state.&lt;ref name="Reddien04"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddien PW, Sánchez Alvarado A | title = Fundamentals of planarian regeneration | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 20 | pages = 725–57 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15473858 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.20.010403.095114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Caudata]] ("urodeles"; [[salamander]]s and [[newt]]s), an [[Order (biology)|order]] of tailed [[amphibia]]ns, is possibly the most adept [[vertebrate]] group at regeneration, given their capability of regenerating limbs, tails, jaws, eyes and a variety of internal structures.&lt;ref name="Carlson07" /&gt; The regeneration of organs is a common and widespread adaptive capability among [[metazoa]]n creatures.&lt;ref name="Sánchez00" /&gt; In a related context, some animals are able to reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] through [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]], [[budding]], or [[fission (biology)|fission]].&lt;ref name="Brokes08" /&gt; A planarian parent, for example, will constrict, split in the middle, and each half generates a new end to form two [[Clone (cell biology)|clones]] of the original.&lt;ref name="Campbell_1996"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Campbell NA | title=Biology | edition=4th | year = 1996 | publisher=The Benjamin Cummings Publishing Company, Inc. | place=California | pages=1206 | isbn = 978-0-8053-1940-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Echinoderms]] (such as the sea star), crayfish, many reptiles, and amphibians exhibit remarkable examples of tissue regeneration. The case of [[autotomy]], for example, serves as a defensive function as the animal detaches a limb or tail to avoid capture. After the limb or tail has been autotomized, cells move into action and the tissues will regenerate.&lt;ref name="Wilkie01"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkie IC | title = Autotomy as a prelude to regeneration in echinoderms | journal = Microscopy Research and Technique | volume = 55 | issue = 6 | pages = 369–96 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11782069 | doi = 10.1002/jemt.1185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maiorana77"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maiorana VC | title=Tail autotomy, functional conflicts and their resolution by a salamander | journal=Nature | volume=2265 | issue=5594 | pages=533–535 | year=1977 | doi=10.1038/265533a0| bibcode=1977Natur.265..533M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maginnis06"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maginnis TL | title=The costs of autotomy and regeneration in animals: a review and framework for future research | journal=Behavioral Ecology | volume=7 | issue=5 | pages=857–872 | year=2006 | doi=10.1093/beheco/arl010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited regeneration of limbs occurs in most fishes and salamanders, and tail regeneration takes place in larval frogs and toads (but not adults). The whole limb of a salamander or a triton will grow again and again after amputation. In reptiles, chelonians, crocodilians and snakes are unable to regenerate lost parts, but many (not all) kinds of lizards, geckos and iguanas possess regeneration capacity in a high degree. Usually, it involves dropping a section of their tail and regenerating it as part of a defense mechanism. While escaping a predator, if the predator catches the tail, it will disconnect.&lt;ref name="UCSB Science Line"&gt;{{Cite web|title = UCSB Science Line|url = http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=1103|website = scienceline.ucsb.edu|access-date = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecosystems==
{{main|regeneration (ecology)}}

Ecosystems can be regenerative. Following a disturbance, such as a fire or pest outbreak in a forest, [[Pioneer species|pioneering species]] will occupy, compete for space, and establish themselves in the newly opened habitat. The new growth of seedlings and [[Assembly rules|community assembly]] process is known as regeneration in [[ecology]].&lt;ref name="Dietze08"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1890/07-0271.1 | vauthors = Dietze MC, Clark JS | title=Changing the gap dynamics paradigm: Vegetative regenerative control on forest response to disturbance | journal=Ecological Monographs | volume=78 | issue=3 | pages=331–347 | url=http://coweeta.uga.edu/publications/10300.pdf | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey02"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0378-1127(01)00564-3 | vauthors = Bailey J, Covington WW | title=Evaluation ponderosa pine regeneration rates following ecological restoration treatments in northern Arizona, USA | journal=Forest Ecology and Management | volume=155 | pages=271–278 | url= http://library.eri.nau.edu/gsdl/collect/erilibra/index/assoc/HASH0e9a.dir/doc.pdf | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cellular molecular fundamentals==
Pattern formation in the morphogenesis of an animal is regulated by [[Regulation of gene expression|genetic induction factors]] that put cells to work after damage has occurred. Neural cells, for example, express growth-associated proteins, such as [[GAP-43]], [[tubulin]], [[actin]], an array of novel [[neuropeptide]]s, and [[cytokines]] that induce a cellular physiological response to regenerate from the damage.&lt;ref name="Fu97"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fu SY, Gordon T | title = The cellular and molecular basis of peripheral nerve regeneration | journal = Molecular Neurobiology | volume = 14 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 67–116 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9170101 | doi = 10.1007/BF02740621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the genes that are involved in the original development of tissues are reinitialized during the regenerative process. Cells in the [[Primordium|primordia]] of [[zebrafish]] fins, for example, express four genes from the [[homeobox]] ''msx'' family during development and regeneration.&lt;ref name="akimenko96"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Akimenko MA, Johnson SL, Westerfield M, Ekker M | title = Differential induction of four msx homeobox genes during fin development and regeneration in zebrafish | journal = Development | volume = 121 | issue = 2 | pages = 347–57 | date = February 1995 | pmid = 7768177 | url = http://dev.biologists.org/content/121/2/347.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tissues==
"Strategies include the rearrangement of pre-existing tissue, the use of adult [[Somatic cell|somatic]] [[stem cells]] and the dedifferentiation and/or transdifferentiation of cells, and more than one mode can operate in different tissues of the same animal.&lt;ref name="Birbrair 2298–2314"/&gt; All these strategies result in the re-establishment of appropriate tissue polarity, structure and form."&lt;ref name="Alvarado06"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sánchez Alvarado A, Tsonis PA | title = Bridging the regeneration gap: genetic insights from diverse animal models | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = 873–84 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17047686 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1923 | url = http://planaria.neuro.utah.edu/publications/NRG2006.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|873}} During the developmental process, genes are activated that serve to modify the properties of [[Cell potency|cell]] as they differentiate into different tissues. Development and regeneration involves the coordination and organization of populations cells into a [[blastema]], which is "a mound of stem cells from which regeneration begins".&lt;ref name="Kumar07"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar A, Godwin JW, Gates PB, Garza-Garcia AA, Brockes JP | title = Molecular basis for the nerve dependence of limb regeneration in an adult vertebrate | journal = Science | volume = 318 | issue = 5851 | pages = 772–7 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17975060 | pmc = 2696928 | doi = 10.1126/science.1147710 | bibcode = 2007Sci...318..772K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dedifferentiation of cells means that they lose their tissue-specific characteristics as tissues remodel during the regeneration process. This should not be confused with the  transdifferentiation of cells which is when they lose their tissue-specific characteristics during the regeneration process, and then re-differentiate to a different kind of cell.&lt;ref name="Alvarado06" /&gt;

==In animals==

=== Arthropods ===

How prominent morphallactic regeneration is in [[oligochaetes]] is currently not well understood. Although relatively under-reported, it is possible that morphallaxis is a common mode of inter-segment regeneration in annelids. Following regeneration in ''L. variegatus'', past posterior segments sometimes become anterior in the new body orientation, consistent with morphallaxis.

Following amputation, most annelids are capable of sealing their body via rapid muscular contraction. Constriction of body muscle can lead to infection prevention. In certain species, such as ''[[Limnodrilus]]'', [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis]] can be seen within hours after amputation in the [[ectoderm]] and [[mesoderm]]. Amputation is also thought to cause a large migration of cells to the injury site, and these form a wound plug.

===Echinoderms===

Tissue regeneration is widespread among echinoderms and has been well documented in [[starfish]] ''(Asteroidea)'', [[sea cucumber]]s ''(Holothuroidea)'', and [[sea urchin]]s ''(Echinoidea).'' Appendage regeneration in echinoderms has been studied since at least the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Candia Carnevali MD, Bonasoro F, Patruno M, Thorndyke MC | title = Cellular and molecular mechanisms of arm regeneration in crinoid echinoderms: the potential of arm explants | journal = Development Genes and Evolution | volume = 208 | issue = 8 | pages = 421–30 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9799422 | doi = 10.1007/s004270050199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to appendages, some species can regenerate internal organs and parts of their central nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = San Miguel-Ruiz JE, Maldonado-Soto AR, García-Arrarás JE | title = Regeneration of the radial nerve cord in the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima | journal = BMC Developmental Biology | volume = 9 | pages = 3 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19126208 | pmc = 2640377 | doi = 10.1186/1471-213X-9-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to injury starfish can autotomize damaged appendages.

[[File:AxolotlBE.jpg|thumbnail|[[Axolotl]]s can regenerate a variety of structures, including their limbs]]

After amputation, the epidermis migrates to cover the stump in  1–2 hours, forming a structure called the wound epithelium (WE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Satoh A, Bryant SV, Gardiner DM | title = Nerve signaling regulates basal keratinocyte proliferation in the blastema apical epithelial cap in the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 366 | issue = 2 | pages = 374–81 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22537500 | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.03.022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epidermal cells continue to migrate over the WE, resulting in a thickened, specialized signaling center called the apical epithelial cap (AEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Christensen RN, Tassava RA | title = Apical epithelial cap morphology and fibronectin gene expression in regenerating axolotl limbs | journal = Developmental Dynamics | volume = 217 | issue = 2 | pages = 216–24 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10706145 | doi = 10.1002/(sici)1097-0177(200002)217:2&lt;216::aid-dvdy8&gt;3.0.co;2-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next several days there are changes in the underlying stump tissues that result in the formation of a [[blastema]] (a mass of dedifferentiated proliferating cells).

In spite of the historically few researchers studying limb regeneration, remarkable progress has been made recently in establishing the neotenous amphibian the axolotl (''Ambystoma mexicanum'') as a model genetic organism.

An [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]]-funded NCRR grant has led to the establishment of the Ambystoma EST database, the Salamander Genome Project (SGP) that has led to the creation of the first amphibian gene map and several annotated molecular data bases, and the creation of the research community web portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Voss SR, Muzinic L, Zimmerman G | url = http://www.ambystoma.org | title = Sal-Site | work = Ambystoma.org | date = 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regeneration in hydra has been defined as morphallaxis, the process where regeneration results from remodeling of existing material without cellular proliferation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Morgan TH | year = 1901 | title = Regeneration | volume = 7 | series = Columbia University Biological Series | publisher = The MacMillan Company | location = New York | url = https://archive.org/details/regeneration00morggoog }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agata_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agata K, Saito Y, Nakajima E | title = Unifying principles of regeneration I: Epimorphosis versus morphallaxis | journal = Development, Growth &amp; Differentiation | volume = 49 | issue = 2 | pages = 73–8 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17335428 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-169X.2007.00919.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a hydra is cut into two pieces, the remaining severed sections form two fully functional and independent hydra, approximately the same size as the two smaller severed sections.&lt;ref name="Bosch_2007" /&gt; This occurs through the exchange and rearrangement of soft tissues without the formation of new material.&lt;ref name="Wenger_2014" /&gt;

===Aves (birds)===

Owing to a limited literature on the subject, birds are believed to have very limited regenerative abilities as adults. Some studies&lt;ref name="Vorontsova_1960"&gt;{{cite book | title = Asexual Reproduction and Regeneration | vauthors = Vorontsova MA, Liosner LD | veditors = Billet F | translator-first = PM | translator-last1 = Allen | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = Pergamon Press | year = 1960 | location = London | pages = 367–371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on roosters have suggested that birds can adequately regenerate some parts of the limbs and depending on the conditions in which regeneration takes place, such as age of the animal, the inter-relationship of the injured tissue with other muscles, and the type of operation, can involve complete regeneration of some musculoskeletal structure. Werber and Goldschmidt (1909) found that the goose and duck were capable of regenerating their beaks after partial amputation&lt;ref name="Vorontsova_1960" /&gt;  and Sidorova (1962) observed liver regeneration via hypertrophy in roosters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sidorova VF | title = Liver regeneration in birds | journal = Biulleten' Eksperimental'noi Biologii I Meditsiny | volume = 52 | issue = 6 | pages = 1426–9 | date = July 1962 | pmid = 14039265 | doi = 10.1007/BF00785312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds are also capable of regenerating the hair cells in their cochlea following noise damage or ototoxic drug damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cotanche DA, Lee KH, Stone JS, Picard DA | title = Hair cell regeneration in the bird cochlea following noise damage or ototoxic drug damage | journal = Anatomy and Embryology | volume = 189 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–18 | date = January 1994 | pmid = 8192233 | doi = 10.1007/BF00193125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this evidence, contemporary studies suggest reparative regeneration in avian species is limited to periods during embryonic development.

In contrast, slice excision did not allow the joint to regenerate due to the fusion of the skeletal elements seen by an expression of cartilage markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Özpolat BD, Zapata M, Daniel Frugé J, Coote J, Lee J, Muneoka K, Anderson R | title = Regeneration of the elbow joint in the developing chick embryo recapitulates development | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 372 | issue = 2 | pages = 229–38 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23036343 | pmc = 3501998 | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.09.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the physiological regeneration of hair in mammals, birds can regenerate their feathers in order to repair damaged feathers or to attract mates with their plumage. Typically, seasonal changes that are associated with breeding seasons will prompt a hormonal signal for birds to begin regenerating feathers. This has been experimentally induced using thyroid hormones in the Rhode Island Red Fowls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hosker | first = Anne | name-list-format = vanc | title = Regeneration of Feathers after Thyroid Feeding | date = 1936 | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 13 | pages = 344–351 | url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/13/3/344 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammals are capable of cellular and physiological regeneration, but have generally poor reparative regenerative ability across the group.&lt;ref name="Birbrair 2298–2314"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seifert AW 2011"/&gt; Examples of physiological regeneration in mammals include epithelial renewal (e.g., skin and intestinal tract), red blood cell replacement, [[antler]] regeneration and hair cycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kresie L | title = Artificial blood: an update on current red cell and platelet substitutes | journal = Proceedings | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 158–61 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 16369608 | pmc = 1291332 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li C, Pearson A, McMahon C | title = Morphogenetic mechanisms in the cyclic regeneration of hair follicles and deer antlers from stem cells | journal = BioMed Research International | volume = 2013 | pages = 643601 | date = 2013 | pmid = 24383056 | pmc = 3870647 | doi = 10.1155/2013/643601 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Male deer lose their antlers annually during the months of January to April then through regeneration are able to regrow them as an example of physiological regeneration.

In 2012, researchers discovered that two species of [[Spiny Mouse|African Spiny Mice]], ''Acomys kempi'' and ''Acomys percivali'', were capable of completely regenerating the [[autotomy|autotomically]] released or otherwise damaged tissue.

Despite these examples, it is generally accepted that adult [[mammal]]s have limited regenerative capacity compared to most [[vertebrate]] embryos/larvae, adult salamanders and fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Kevin | last = Xu | name-list-format = vanc | title = Humans' Ability To Regenerate Damaged Organs Is At Our Fingertips | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/how-regeneration-works-2013-7 | work = Business Insider | date = July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the regeneration therapy approach of [[Robert O.

Some researchers have also claimed that the [[Murphy Roths Large|MRL mouse]] strain exhibits enhanced regenerative abilities.

{{main|Regeneration in humans}}

The regrowth of lost tissues or organs in the human body is being researched. Some tissues such as skin regrow quite readily; others have been thought to have little or no capacity for regeneration, but ongoing research suggests that there is some hope for a variety of tissues and organs.&lt;ref name="Birbrair 2298–2314"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen2&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Min | first1 = Su | last2 = Wang | first2 = Song W. | last3 = Orr | first3 = William | name-list-format = vanc | title = Graphic general pathology: 2.2 complete regeneration: | work = Pathology | publisher = pathol.med.stu.edu.cn | year = 2006 | quote = After the repair process has been completed, the structure and function of the injured tissue are completely normal. This type of regeneration is common in physiological situations. Examples of physiological regeneration are the continual replacement of cells of the skin and repair of the endometrium after menstruation.

As are all metazoans, humans are capable of physiological regeneration (i.e. the replacement of cells during homeostatic maintenance that does not necessitate injury). For example, the regeneration of red blood cells via erythropoiesis occurs through the maturation of erythrocytes from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, their subsequent circulation for around 90 days in the blood stream, and their eventual cell-death in the spleen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Principles of Regenerative Biology | vauthors = Carlson BM | publisher = Academic Press | year = 2007 | pages = 25–26 | isbn = 978-0-12-369439-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of physiological regeneration is the sloughing and rebuilding of a functional endometrium during each menstrual cycle in females in response to varying levels of circulating estrogen and progesterone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferenczy A, Bertrand G, Gelfand MM | title = Proliferation kinetics of human endometrium during the normal menstrual cycle | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 133 | issue = 8 | pages = 859–67 | date = April 1979 | pmid = 434029 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9378(79)90302-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, humans are limited in their capacity for reparative regeneration, which occurs in response to injury. One of the most studied regenerative responses in humans is the hypertrophy of the liver following liver injury.&lt;ref name="Michalopoulos_1997"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michalopoulos GK, DeFrances MC | title = Liver regeneration | journal = Science | volume = 276 | issue = 5309 | pages = 60–6 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9082986 | doi = 10.1126/science.276.5309.60 | pmc = 2701258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taub_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taub R | title = Liver regeneration: from myth to mechanism | journal = Nature Reviews.

This response is considered cellular regeneration (a form of compensatory hypertrophy) where the function and mass of the liver is regenerated through the proliferation of existing mature hepatic cells (mainly hepatocytes), but the exact morphology of the liver is not regained.&lt;ref name="Taub_2004" /&gt; This process is driven by growth factor and cytokine regulated pathways.&lt;ref name="Michalopoulos_1997" /&gt; The normal sequence of inflammation and regeneration does not function accurately in cancer. Specifically, cytokine stimulation of cells leads to expression of genes that change cellular functions and suppress the immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlahopoulos SA | title = Aberrant control of NF-κB in cancer permits transcriptional and phenotypic plasticity, to curtail dependence on host tissue: molecular mode | journal = Cancer Biology &amp; Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 254–270 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28884042 | pmc = 5570602 | doi = 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2017.0029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this may be an important target for regenerative medicine as it implies that regeneration of cardiomyocytes, and consequently of myocardium, can be induced.

Another example of reparative regeneration in humans is fingertip regeneration, which occurs after phalange amputation distal to the nail bed (especially in children)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McKim LH | title = REGENERATION OF THE DISTAL PHALANX | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 549–50 | date = May 1932 | pmid = 20318716 | pmc = 402335 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muneoka K, Allan CH, Yang X, Lee J, Han M | title = Mammalian regeneration and regenerative medicine | journal = Birth Defects Research.

[[File:Riparian strip.jpg|thumb|right|A well-preserved natural riparian strip on a tributary to [[Lake Erie]]]]

A '''riparian zone''' or '''riparian area''' is the interface between land and a [[river]] or [[stream]]. '''Riparian''' is also the proper nomenclature for one of the fifteen terrestrial [[biome]]s of the Earth. Plant habitats and communities along the river margins and [[Bank (geography)|banks]] are called riparian vegetation, characterized by [[Aquatic plant|hydrophilic plants]]. Riparian zones are important in [[ecology]], [[environmental resource management]], and [[civil engineering]] because of their role in [[soil conservation]], their habitat [[biodiversity]], and the influence they have on [[fauna]] and [[aquatic ecosystem]]s, including [[grassland]]s, [[woodland]]s, [[wetland]]s, or even non-vegetative areas.  In some regions the terms '''riparian woodland''', '''[[riparian forest]]''', '''[[riparian buffer]] zone,''' '''riparian corridor''' and '''riparian strip''' are used to characterize a riparian zone. The word ''riparian'' is derived from [[Latin]] ''[[wiktionary:ripa|ripa]]'', meaning river bank.

==Characteristics==
Riparian zones may be natural or engineered for soil stabilization or [[Land rehabilitation|restoration]]. These zones are important natural [[biofilter]]s, protecting aquatic environments from excessive [[sediment]]ation, polluted [[surface runoff]] and [[erosion]]. They supply shelter and food for many [[aquatic animal]]s and shade that limits stream temperature change. When riparian zones are damaged by [[construction]], [[agriculture]] or [[silviculture]], biological restoration can take place, usually by human intervention in [[erosion control]] and revegetation. If the area adjacent to a watercourse has standing water or saturated soil for as long as a season, it is normally termed a [[wetland]] because of its [[hydric soil]] characteristics. Because of their prominent role in supporting a [[biodiversity|diversity of species]], riparian zones are often the subject of national protection in a [[biodiversity action plan]]. These are also known as a "Plant or Vegetation Waste Buffer".

Research shows that riparian zones are instrumental in [[water quality]] improvement for both surface runoff and water flowing into streams through subsurface or [[groundwater]] flow. Riparian zones can play a role in lowering nitrate contamination in surface runoff, such as manure and other [[fertilizer]]s from [[Field (agriculture)|agricultural fields]], that would otherwise damage [[ecosystem]]s and human health. Particularly, the attenuation of [[nitrate]] or [[denitrification]] of the nitrates from [[fertilizer]] in this buffer zone is important. The use of wetland riparian zones shows a particularly high rate of removal of nitrate entering a stream and thus has a place in agricultural management.

==Roles and functions==
[[File:Pisuerga2.JPG|thumb|right|Thick riparian vegetation along the [[Pisuerga|Pisuerga River]] in [[Spain]]]]
Riparian zones dissipate stream energy. The [[meander]]ing curves of a river, combined with vegetation and root systems, slow the flow of water, which reduces soil erosion and flood damage. Sediment is trapped, reducing suspended solids to create less [[turbidity|turbid]] water, replenish soils, and build stream banks. Pollutants are filtered from surface runoff, enhancing water quality via biofiltration.

The riparian zones also provide [[wildlife]] [[habitat]], increased biodiversity, and [[wildlife corridor]]s, enabling aquatic and riparian organisms to move along river systems avoiding isolated communities. Riparian vegetation can also provide [[Fodder|forage]] for wildlife and livestock.

Riparian zones are also important for the fish that live within rivers, such as brook and charr. Impacts to riparian zones can affect fish, and restoration is not always sufficient to recover fish populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sievers |first1=Michael |last2=Hale |first2=Robin |last3=Morrongiello |first3=John R. |title=Do trout respond to riparian change? A meta-analysis with implications for restoration and management |journal=Freshwater Biology |date=March 2017 |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=445–457 |doi=10.1111/fwb.12888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They provide native [[landscape]] irrigation by extending seasonal or perennial flows of water. Nutrients from terrestrial vegetation (e.g. [[plant litter]] and insect drop) are transferred to aquatic food webs. The vegetation surrounding the stream helps to shade the water, mitigating [[thermal pollution|water temperature changes]].  The vegetation also contributes wood debris to streams, which is important to maintaining [[geomorphology]].

From a social aspect, riparian zones contribute to nearby property values through amenity and views, and they improve enjoyment for footpaths and bikeways through supporting [[Greenway (landscape)#Foreshoreway|foreshoreway]] networks. Space is created for riparian sports such as fishing, swimming and launching for vessels and paddlecraft.

The riparian zone acts as a sacrificial erosion buffer to absorb impacts of factors including [[climate change]], increased runoff from [[urbanization]] and increased [[Wake#Wake pattern of a boat|boat wake]] without damaging structures located behind a setback zone.

==Role in logging==
The protection of riparian zones is often a consideration in [[logging]] operations.  The undisturbed soil, soil cover, and vegetation provide shade, plant litter, and woody material, and reduce the delivery of [[soil erosion|soil eroded]] from the harvested area. Factors such as soil types and [[root]] structures, [[Climate|climatic]] conditions and vegetative cover determine the effectiveness of riparian buffering.

==Vegetation==
[[File:Willow Creek, Trout Creek Mountains, Oregon.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Riparian zone along Trout Creek in the [[Trout Creek Mountains]], part of the Burns Bureau of Land Management District in southeastern [[Oregon]]. The creek provides critical habitat for [[trout]].]]

The assortment of riparian zone trees varies from those of wetlands and typically consists of plants that are either emergent aquatic plants, or [[herb]]s, [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s that thrive in proximity to water.

==Repair and restoration==
Land clearing followed by floods can quickly erode a riverbank, taking valuable grasses and soils downstream, and later allowing the sun to bake the land dry. [[Natural Sequence Farming]] techniques have been used in the [[Upper Hunter Shire|Upper Hunter]] Valley of [[New South Wales]], Australia, in an attempt to rapidly restore eroded farms to optimum productivity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The Natural Sequence Farming technique involves placing obstacles in the water's pathway to lessen the energy of a flood, and help the water to deposit soil and [[Seep (hydrology) |seep]] into the flood zone. Another technique is to quickly establish [[ecological succession]] by encouraging fast-growing plants such as "weeds" ([[pioneer species]]) to grow. These may spread along the watercourse and cause environmental degradation, but may stabilize the soil, place carbon into the ground, and protect the land from drying. The weeds will improve the streambeds so that trees and grasses can return, and later ideally replace the weeds. There are several other techniques used by government and non-government agencies to address riparian and streambed degradation, ranging from the installation of bed control structures such as log sills to the use of pin groynes or rock emplacement.

A '''risk management plan''' is a document that a [[project manager]] prepares to foresee risks, estimate impacts, and define responses to issues. It also contains a [[Risk matrix|risk assessment matrix]].

A risk is "an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project's objectives."&lt;ref&gt;[[Project Management Body of Knowledge|PMBOK]] Guide 5th Edition, Glossary pg. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; Risk is inherent with any [[project]], and [[project manager]]s should assess risks continually and develop plans to address them.  The risk management plan contains an analysis of likely risks with both high and low impact, as well as mitigation strategies to help the project avoid being derailed should common problems arise.  Risk management plans should be periodically reviewed by the project team to avoid having the analysis become stale and not reflective of actual potential project risks.

Most critically, [[risk management]] plans include a risk strategy.  

==Risk response==
{{main |Risk management#Potential risk treatments}}
Broadly, there are four potential responses to risk with numerous variations on the specific terms used to name these response options:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Special Publication 800-37 RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND ORGANIZATIONS |date=May 2018 |edition=revision 2 draft |publisher=National Institute of Science and Technology |url= https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-2/draft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |title=CRISC Review Manual
 |date=2015
 |edition=6th
 |publisher=ISACA
 |isbn=978-1-60420-371-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid – Change plans to circumvent the problem;
* Control / mitigate / modify / reduce – Reduce threat impact or likelihood (or both) through intermediate steps;
* Accept / retain – Assume the chance of the negative impact (or ''auto-insurance''), eventually ''budget'' the cost (e.g. via a contingency budget line); or 
* Transfer / share – Outsource risk (or a portion of the risk) to a third party or parties that can manage the outcome. This is done financially through insurance contracts or hedging transactions, or operationally through outsourcing an activity.

(Mnemonic: SARA, for '''S'''hare '''A'''void '''R'''educe '''A'''ccept, or A-CAT, for "Avoid, Control, Accept, or Transfer")

Risk management plans often include matrices.

==Examples==
The United States Department of Defense, as part of acquisition, uses risk management planning that may have a Risk Management Plan document for the specific project.  The general intent of the RMP in this context is to define the scope of risks to be tracked and means of documenting reports.  It is also desired that there would be an integrated relationship to other processes.  An example of this would be explaining which developmental tests verify risks of the design type were minimized are stated as part of the [[test and evaluation master plan]].  A further example would be instructions from 5000.2D&lt;ref&gt;[https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=44705&amp;lang=en-US SECNAVINST 5000.2D 3.4.4.1]&lt;/ref&gt; that for programs that are part of a [[system of systems]] the risk management strategy shall specifically address integration and interoperability as a risk area.  The RMP specific process and templates shift over time (e.g. the disappearance of 2002 documents Defense Finance and Accounting Service / System Risk Management Plan, and the SPAWAR Risk Management Process).

'''Serosorting''', also known as "serodiscrimination", is the practice of using HIV status as a decision-making point in choosing [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]]. Frequently the term is used to describe the behavior of a person who chooses a sexual partner assumed to be of the same HIV [[serostatus]] in order to engage in [[Safe sex|unprotected sex]] with them for a reduced risk of acquiring or transmitting [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/research/resources/other/serosorting.htm |title=Meeting Summary: "Consultation on Serosorting Practices among Men who Have Sex with Men" |date=31 March 2009 |work=cdc.gov |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge of [[HIV status]] is based on the result of a person's [[HIV test]], with a positive result indicating that a person has HIV, and can potentially transmit the disease to others during any sexual contact involving an exchange of bodily fluids (e.g., unprotected anal or vaginal sex). There are many situations where determining their partner's serostatus outside of clinical settings cannot be done ''with complete certainty'', limiting the efficacy in mitigating the transmission of [[HIV/AIDS]] (or other [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]]). As people do not typically engage in sex practices with the expectation of contracting or transmitting HIV, failed attempts at serosorting are a leading cause of the contraction of HIV among partners.

==Terms and etymology==
The word '''''serosorting''''' comes from the Latin word ''serum'', which refers to [[blood serum]]. Sorting refers to choosing partners based on HIV status, which can be determined from blood tests, among other methods. '''[[Serodiscordant]] sex''' refers to sex between an HIV-positive person and an HIV-negative person; typically partners practicing serosorting make an attempt to find someone with a matching HIV test result, otherwise known as a '''seroconcordant''' partner.

==Risks associated with serosorting==

===Failure to accurately determine HIV status===
Failure to accurately determine HIV status may stem from people not being sure of their true HIV status (or not admitting to having [[HIV]])—even a recent negative result from an [[HIV test]] may not be definitive of a person's serostatus, because if they are still within the [[window period]] following a recent infection, the [[antibodies]] that the blood tests measure will not be present yet. In addition, testing negative for [[HIV]] does not guarantee that they are free of other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs) such as [[Human Papillomavirus|HPV]] or [[hepatitis B]].

However, the largest experiment with serosorting has been conducted in the [[adult film]] industry by the Adult Industry Medical Healthcare Foundation. The Adult Industry Medical testing program, or AIM, eliminates virtually all possibility of lying{{how|date=November 2013}} and enforces a high frequency of testing for a variety of STDs that can make the transmission of [[HIV]] more likely. All actors in legitimate adult films are tested twice a year for [[herpes]], [[gonorrhea]], [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[syphilis]], hepatitis types [[Hepatitis A|A]],&amp;nbsp;[[Hepatitis B|B]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Hepatitis C|C]], and HIV—as well as monthly for HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Before this program of testing, adult film actors had a very high rate of STDs, but now have only a 20% higher rate of STDs than the general public.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===As a substitution for condom use===
Dr. Matthew Golden of King County Public Health, in Washington, conducted a study with sexually active West Coast men and concluded that the patient population did demonstrate limited protection from HIV by serosorting. In his study, 3.5% of the men that used neither condoms nor serosorting became HIV-positive, as compared to 2.6% of the men that practiced serosorting alone, and 1.5% of the men who reported consistent [[condom]] use without serosorting.

Golden's population differs from AIM's in that [[anal sex]] made up a high proportion of the subjects' sexual habits, their testing intervals were typically longer and less regular, there were no tests for STDs other than HIV, such as [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] (an important factor considering other STDs may hasten the spread of the virus), and there were no protections against falsely reporting any of the results. Golden's study did not cover the use of serosorting combined with [[condoms]]—which, theoretically, would be more effective than either precaution used separately.&lt;ref name="Goldenstudy"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Golden, MR |author2=Stekler, J |author3=Hughes, JP |author4=Wood, RW |year=2008 |title=HIV serosorting in men who have sex with men: is it safe? |journal=[[Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes]] |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=212–8 |doi=10.1097/QAI.0b013e31818455e8 |pmid=18769346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disease exchange between seroconcordant people===
Serosorting does not fully protect against all STDs during [[unprotected sex]] between two people infected with HIV. Infection with ''one'' strain of HIV does not preclude later infection with ''another'' strain. There is a great deal of genetic variability within individual HIV populations, because this variability is shuffled and [[mutated]] every time the virus (numbering in the millions) reproduces inside the infected person's body. Modern drug cocktails keep virus and mutation levels low but eventually [[drug resistance]] will develop. Unprotected sex between two individuals positive for HIV still presents the risk of one of them—with a relatively less aggressive strain of the virus—exchanging genetic sequences with their partner's more drug-resistant cousin, and becoming harder to treat.&lt;ref name='pmid 16052079'&gt;{{cite journal

==Motivation for serosorting==

===Lower rates of changing each other's serostatus===
Studies have shown that serosorting provides some limited decrease in risk of contracting [[HIV]] among [[Men who have sex with men]] (MSMs) who use it as an HIV risk reduction technique.&lt;ref name="Goldenstudy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journals.lww.com/aidsonline/Abstract/2005/04001/Sexual_harm_reduction_practices_of.2.aspx | title=Sexual harm reduction practices of HIV-seropositive gay and bisexual men: serosorting, strategic positioning, and withdrawal before ejaculation | publisher=[[AIDS (journal)|AIDS]] |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=S13–S25 | date=April 2005 | accessdate=2010-12-23 |author1=Parsons, Jeffrey T |author2=Schrimshaw, Eric W |author3=Wolitski, Richard J |author4=Halkitis, Perry N |author5=Purcell, David W |author6=Hoff, Colleen C |author7=Gómez, Cynthia A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aidsmap.com/en/news/E198EB3E-2EE3-48D6-BAC2-0C5EF17CE24A.asp |title=Is serosorting working, or even possible? |author=Gus Cairns |date=22 August 2006 |accessdate=2008-06-02 |publisher=[[aidsmap]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been seen as controversial in being used to engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] without regard to [[safer sex]] practices, as either participants were free of HIV or were already [[asymptomatic carrier|carrier]]s. Although the practice has occurred informally since the [[AIDS pandemic]] began,&lt;ref name="serosortingintro"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thebody.com/content/art40765.html | title=Serosorting | publisher=[[San Francisco AIDS Foundation]] | date=Winter 2007 | accessdate=2010-12-23 |author1=Siconolfi, Daniel E |author2=Moeller, Robert W }}&lt;/ref&gt; serosorting has become more prevalent with online [[social networking]] sites now facilitating interactions, and even some health professionals citing [[harm reduction]] concepts for [[gay]] men as a measure to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Race |first=Kane |year=2010 |title=Click Here for HIV Status: Shifting Templates of Sexual Negotiation |journal=Emotion Space &amp; Society |pages=7–14 |volume=3 |issue=1 |doi=10.1016/j.emospa.2010.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New developments===
There has been further evolution on the idea of serosorting since the introduction of home-based rapid result tests. Prior to engaging in unprotected sex the two partners get tested together. If the immediate results are concordant they choose to have unprotected sex; while if the result is discordant condoms are used.

===The appeal of bareback sex===
'''[[Bareback (sex)|Barebacking]]''', or having male-to-male anal sex without using a [[condom]], first became articulated in magazines such as [[POZ (magazine)|POZ]] in 1995–96 as a practice taking place among HIV-positive men, and may be seen as an early articulation of serosorting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Race |first=Kane |year=2010 |title=Engaging in a Culture of Barebacking: Gay Men and the Risk of HIV Prevention |journal=HIV Treatment and Prevention Technologies in International Perspective |isbn=978-0-230-23819-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6450">A '''shadow biosphere''' is a hypothetical [[microbe|microbial]] [[biosphere]] of Earth that uses radically different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[molecular biology|molecular]] processes than currently known life. Although life on Earth is relatively well-studied, the shadow biosphere may still remain unnoticed because the exploration of the microbial world targets primarily the biochemistry of the macro-organisms. The term was coined by Carol Cleland and Shelley Copley in 2005.&lt;ref name="Cleland and Copley 2005"&gt;Cleland and Copley (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The hypothesis==
It has been proposed that the early Earth hosted multiple origins of life, some of which produced chemical variations on life as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland, C.E. (2007) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18053938 Epistemological issues in the study of microbial life: alternative biospheres]. Studies in the History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences 38:847–861.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/apr/14/shadow-biosphere-alien-life-on-earth "Life on Earth… but not as we know it"], Robin McKie, 14 April 2013, The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; Steven A. Benner, Alonso Ricardo, and Matthew A. Carrigan, biochemists at the [[University of Florida]], argued that if [[RNA world hypothesis|organisms based on RNA]] once existed, they might still be alive today, unnoticed because they do not contain [[ribosome]]s, which are usually used to detect living microorganisms. They suggest searching for them in environments that are low in [[sulfur]], environments that are spatially constrained (for example, minerals with pores smaller than one [[micrometre]]), or environments that cycle between extreme hot and cold.&lt;ref&gt;Benner, S. A., Ricardo, A. and Carrigan, M. A. (2004) [http://www.ffame.org/sbenner/cochembiol8.672-689.pdf Is there a common chemical model for life in the universe?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214063212/http://www.ffame.org/sbenner/cochembiol8.672-689.pdf |date=2010-12-14 }}. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., 8, 672-689.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other proposed candidates for a shadow biosphere include organisms using different suites of amino acids in their proteins or different molecular units (e.g., bases or sugars) in their nucleic acids,&lt;ref name="Cleland and Copley 2005"/&gt; having a [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] opposite of ours, using some of the [[Amino acid#Non-standard amino acids|non-standard amino acids]], or using [[arsenic]] instead of [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, P. C. W. , Benner, S.A., Cleland, C.E., Lineweaver,C.H., McKay,C.P. and Wolfe-Simon,F. [http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/ast.2008.0251 Signatures of a Shadow Biosphere] (2009) Astrobiology. 9(2): 241-249. {{doi|10.1089/ast.2008.0251}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carol Cleland, a philosopher of science at the University of Colorado (Boulder), argues that [[desert varnish]], whose status as living or nonliving has been debated since the time of Darwin, should be investigated as a potential candidate for a shadow biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/apr/14/shadow-biosphere-alien-life-on-earth "Life on Earth… but not as we know it"], Robin McKie, 14 April 2013, The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The idea of a shadow biosphere is not widely accepted in biochemistry, and methods used by proponents and conclusions drawn from experiments that purport to show evidence of shadow biospheres have been criticized. For example, evidence that once seemed to support arsenic as a substitute for phosphorus in DNA could have resulted from lab or field contamination, and DNA that includes arsenic is chemically unstable.&lt;ref name=vastag&gt;{{cite news|last=Vastag|first=Brian|title=Debate over arsenic-based life enters a new chapter|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/debate-over-arsenic-based-life-enters-a-new-chapter/2011/05/26/AGhk7fCH_story.html?hpid=z9|newspaper=Washington Post|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computing]], '''signed number representations''' are required to encode [[negative number]]s in binary number systems.

In [[mathematics]], negative numbers in any base are represented by prefixing them with a minus ("&amp;minus;") sign. However, in [[computer hardware]], numbers are represented only as sequences of [[bit]]s, without extra symbols. The four best-known methods of extending the [[binary numeral system]] to represent [[signed number]]s are: [[#Sign-and-magnitude method|sign-and-magnitude]], [[#Ones' complement|ones' complement]], [[#Two's complement|two's complement]], and [[#Excess-K|offset binary]]. Some of the alternative methods use implicit instead of explicit signs, such as negative binary, using the [[#Base −2|base −2]]. Corresponding methods can be devised for [[positional notation|other bases]], whether positive, negative, fractional, or other elaborations on such themes.

There is no definitive criterion by which any of the representations is universally superior. The representation used in most current computing devices is two's complement, although the [[UNIVAC 1100/2200 series|Unisys ClearPath Dorado series]] mainframes use ones' complement.

==History==
The early days of digital computing were marked by a lot of competing ideas about both hardware technology and mathematics technology (numbering systems). One of the great debates was the format of negative numbers, with some of the era's most expert people having very strong and different opinions.{{Citation needed|reason=Please reference these debates|date=May 2012}} One camp supported [[two's complement]], the system that is dominant today.  Another camp supported ones' complement, where any positive value is made into its negative equivalent by inverting all of the bits in a word.  A third group supported "sign &amp;amp; magnitude" (sign-magnitude), where a value is changed from positive to negative simply by toggling the word's sign (high-order) bit.

There were arguments for and against each of the systems.&lt;!--{{Citation needed|reason=Cite these arguments|date=May 2012}}--the rest of the article gives reasons --&gt;  Sign &amp;amp; magnitude allowed for easier tracing of memory dumps (a common process 40 years ago) as small numeric values use fewer 1 bits.&lt;!-- this is obvious enough --&gt; Internally, these systems did ones' complement math so numbers would have to be converted to ones' complement values when they were transmitted from a register to the math unit and then converted back to sign-magnitude when the result was transmitted back to the register&lt;!--{{Citation needed|reason=Cite one of these systems|date=May 2012}}-- this is the most hardware efficient way to do it. It is likely how they did it--&gt;.  The electronics required more gates than the other systems{{snd}}a key concern when the cost and packaging of discrete transistors was critical.  IBM was one of the early supporters of sign-magnitude, with their [[IBM 704|704]], [[IBM 709|709]] and [[IBM 7090|709x]] series computers being perhaps the best known systems to use it.

Ones' complement allowed for somewhat simpler hardware designs as there was no need to convert values when passed to and from the math unit.  But it also shared an undesirable characteristic with sign-magnitude{{snd}}the ability to represent [[negative zero]] (−0). Negative zero behaves exactly like positive zero; when used as an operand in any calculation, the result will be the same whether an operand is positive or negative zero.  The disadvantage, however, is that the existence of two forms of the same value necessitates two rather than a single comparison when checking for equality with zero.  Ones' complement subtraction can also result in an [[end-around borrow]] (described below).  It can be argued that this makes the addition/subtraction logic more complicated or that it makes it simpler as a subtraction requires simply inverting the bits of the second operand as it is passed to the adder.  The [[PDP-1]], [[CDC 160 series]], [[CDC 3000]] series, [[CDC 6000 series]], [[UNIVAC 1100]] series, and the [[LINC]] computer use ones' complement representation.

Two's complement is the easiest to implement in hardware, which may be the ultimate reason for its widespread popularity.{{Citation needed|reason=Has it ever been proven to be the easiest to implement|date=May 2012}} Processors on the early mainframes often consisted of thousands of transistors{{snd}}eliminating a significant number of transistors was a significant cost savings.  Mainframes such as the [[IBM System/360]], the [[GE-600 series]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/GE-635.html#Binary%20Fixed-Point%20Numbers|title=GE-625 / 635 Programming Reference Manual|publisher=[[General Electric]]|date=January 1966|accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[PDP-6]] and [[PDP-10]] use two's complement, as did minicomputers such as the [[PDP-5]] and [[PDP-8]] and the [[PDP-11]] and [[VAX]].  The architects of the early integrated circuit-based CPUs ([[Intel 8080]], etc.) chose to use two's complement math.  As IC technology advanced, virtually all adopted two's complement technology. [[x86]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://download.intel.com/products/processor/manual/325462.pdf|title=Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual|at=Section 4.2.1|publisher=[[Intel]]|accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[m68k]], [[Power Architecture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.power.org/documentation/power-isa-version-2-07/|title=Power ISA Version 2.07|at=Section 1.4|publisher=[[Power.org]]|accessdate=August 6, 2013}},&lt;/ref&gt; [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[SPARC]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[Itanium]], [[PA-RISC]], and [[DEC Alpha]] processors are all two's complement.

=={{anchor|Sign-and-magnitude method}}Signed magnitude representation==
This representation is also called "sign–magnitude" or "sign and magnitude" representation.  In this approach, a number's sign is represented with a '''[[sign bit]]''': setting that [[bit]] (often the [[most significant bit]]) to 0 for a positive number or positive zero, and setting it to 1 for a negative number or negative zero.  The remaining bits in the number indicate the magnitude (or [[absolute value]]). Hence, in a [[byte]] with only seven bits (apart from the sign bit), the magnitude can range from 0000000 (0) to 1111111 (127). Thus numbers ranging from &amp;minus;127&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; to +127&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; can be represented once the sign bit (the eighth bit) is added.  For example, &amp;minus;43&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; encoded in an eight-bit byte is &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;0101011 while 43&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;0101011. A consequence of using signed magnitude representation is that there are two ways to represent zero, 00000000 (0) and 10000000 ([[−0]]).

This approach is directly comparable to the common way of showing a sign (placing a "+" or "&amp;minus;" next to the number's magnitude).  Some early binary computers (e.g., [[IBM 7090]]) use this representation, perhaps because of its natural relation to common usage. Signed magnitude is the most common way of representing the [[significand]] in [[floating point]] values.

{{Main|Ones' complement}}

Alternatively, a system known as ones' complement can be used to represent negative numbers. The ones' complement form of a negative binary number is the [[bitwise NOT]] applied to it, i.e. the "complement" of its positive counterpart. Like sign-and-magnitude representation, ones' complement has two representations of 0: 00000000 (+0) and 11111111 ([[−0]]).

As an example, the ones' complement form of 00101011 (43&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) becomes 11010100 (&amp;minus;43&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;). The range of [[signedness|signed]] numbers using ones' complement is represented by {{nobr|−(2&lt;sup&gt;''N''−1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)}} to {{nobr|(2&lt;sup&gt;''N''−1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)}} and ±0. A conventional eight-bit byte is −127&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; to +127&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; with zero being either 00000000 (+0) or 11111111 (−0).

To add two numbers represented in this system, one does a conventional binary addition, but it is then necessary to do an ''end-around carry'': that is, add any resulting [[carry flag|carry]] back into the resulting sum. To see why this is necessary, consider the following example showing the case of the addition of &amp;minus;1 (11111110) to +2 (00000010):

&lt;pre style="width:35em;"&gt;
          binary    decimal
        11111110     –1
     +  00000010     +2
     ───────────     ──
      1 00000000      0   ← Not the correct answer
               1     +1   ← Add carry
     ───────────     ──
        00000001      1   ← Correct answer
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the previous example, the first binary addition gives 00000000, which is incorrect. The correct result (00000001) only appears when the carry is added back in. 

A remark on terminology: The system is referred to as "ones' complement" because the [[Negation#Programming|negation]] of a positive value &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; (represented as the [[bitwise NOT]] of &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;) can also be formed by subtracting &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; from the ones' complement representation of zero that is a long sequence of ones (−0). Two's complement arithmetic, on the other hand, forms the negation of &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; by subtracting &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; from a single large power of two that is [[Congruence relation|congruent]] to +0.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Knuth: ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'', Volume 2: Seminumerical Algorithms, chapter 4.1&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ones' complement and two's complement representations of the same negative value will differ by one.

Note that the ones' complement representation of a negative number can be obtained from the sign-magnitude representation merely by bitwise complementing the magnitude.

{{Main|Two's complement}}

The problems of multiple representations of 0 and the need for the [[end-around carry]] are circumvented by a system called '''two's complement'''. In two's complement, negative numbers are represented by the bit pattern which is one greater (in an unsigned sense) than the ones' complement of the positive value.

In two's-complement, there is only one zero, represented as 00000000. Negating a number (whether negative or positive) is done by inverting all the bits and then adding one to that result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two's Complement|url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tomf/notes/cps104/twoscomp.html|publisher=[[Cornell University]]|date=April 2000|author=Thomas Finley|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This actually reflects the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] structure on all integers [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] [[power of two|2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;]]: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/2^N\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Addition of a pair of two's-complement integers is the same as addition of a pair of [[signedness|unsigned numbers]] (except for detection of [[integer overflow|overflow]], if that is done); the same is true for subtraction and even for ''N'' lowest significant bits of a product (value of multiplication). For instance, a two's-complement addition of 127 and −128 gives the same binary bit pattern as an unsigned addition of 127 and 128, as can be seen from the 8-bit two's complement table.

An easier method to get the negation of a number in two's complement is as follows:

{|class="wikitable"
!
! Example 1
! Example 2
|-
| 1. Starting from the right, find the first "1"
|align="center"| 0010100'''1'''
|align="center"| 00101'''1'''00
|-
| 2. Invert all of the bits to the left of that "1"
|align="center"| '''1101011'''1
|align="center"| '''11010'''100
|}

Method two:

# Invert all the bits through the number
# Add one

Example: for +2, which is 00000010 in binary (the ~ character is the [[C (programming language)|C]] [[bitwise NOT]] operator, so ~X means "invert all the bits in X"):

# ~00000010 → 11111101
# 11111101 + 1 → 11111110 (−2 in two's complement)

{{Main|Offset binary}}

[[Offset binary]], also called [[Excess-K|excess-&lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;]] or [[biased representation (arithmetics)|biased representation]], uses a pre-specified number &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt; as a biasing value. A value is represented by the unsigned number which is &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt; greater than the intended value. Thus 0 is represented by &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;, and &amp;minus;&lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt; is represented by the all-zeros bit pattern. This can be seen as a slight modification and generalization of the aforementioned two's-complement, which is virtually the {{nobr|excess-(2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;var&gt;N&lt;/var&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} representation with [[negated]] [[most significant bit]].

Biased representations are now primarily used for the exponent of [[floating-point]] numbers. The [[IEEE floating-point standard]] defines the exponent field of a [[single-precision]] (32-bit) number as an 8-bit [[excess-127]] field. The [[double-precision]] (64-bit) exponent field is an 11-bit [[excess-1023]] field; see [[exponent bias]]. It also had use for binary-coded decimal numbers as [[excess-3]].

==Base −2==
{{See also|Negative base}}
In conventional binary number systems, the base, or [[radix]], is 2; thus the rightmost bit represents 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, the next bit represents 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the next bit 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and so on. However, a binary number system with base &amp;minus;2 is also possible.
The rightmost bit represents {{nowrap|(&amp;minus;2)&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} +1}}, the next bit represents {{nowrap|(&amp;minus;2)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} &amp;minus;2}}, the next bit {{nowrap|(&amp;minus;2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} +4}} and so on, with alternating sign. The numbers that can be represented with four bits are shown in the comparison table below.

The range of numbers that can be represented is asymmetric. If the word has an even number of bits, the magnitude of the largest negative number that can be represented is twice as large as the largest positive number that can be represented, and vice versa if the word has an odd number of bits.

==Other systems==
Google's [[Protocol Buffers]] "zig-zag encoding" is a system similar to sign-and-magnitude, but uses the [[least significant bit]] to represent the sign and has a single representation of zero. This allows a [[variable-length quantity]] encoding intended for nonnegative (unsigned) integers to be used efficiently for signed integers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#types Protocol Buffers: Signed Integers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach is to give each [[numerical digit|digit]] a sign, yielding the [[signed-digit representation]]. For instance, in 1726, [[John Colson]] advocated reducing expressions to "small numbers", numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. In 1840, [[Augustin Cauchy]] also expressed preference for such modified decimal numbers to reduce errors in computation.

The '''Tehran School of Political Science''' ({{lang-fa|مدرسه علوم سياسی تهران}} ''Madraseh-ye olum-e siyasi''), was one of the first modern institutions of higher education in Iran at the turn of the twentieth century. Most of the nation's political elite graduated from the school.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==History==

The School of Political Science was founded in 1899 by [[Hassan Pirnia]]. It was run by the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Iran)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. It later merged with the School of Law (''Madreseh-ye alee-e hoquq''), which had been established in 1918, to form the Faculty of Law and Political Science of the [[University of Tehran]] in 1933.

==People==
===Political===
Many of the school's faculty and [[alumni]] later became ministers and political figures in Iran. Notable examples are:

[[File:Terrorism Research Centre LOGO.jpg|thumb|right|TRC Logo]]
The '''Terrorism Research Center (TRC)''' is non-profit [[think tank]] focused on investigating and researching global [[terrorism]] issues through multi-disciplinary collaboration amongst a group of international experts.

== History 1996 to 2012==
The TRC was founded in 1996 by Matthew Devost, Brian Houghton, and Neal Pollard to establish an organization with a specific focus on terrorism and emerging international security issues like [[information warfare]].  It was purchased by [[Academi|Blackwater]]'s [[Erik Prince]] in 2007.  Over the course of 14 years, the TRC conducted research, analysis, and training on variety of [[Counter-terrorism|counterterrorism]] and [[homeland security]] issues.

=== Website (1996 to 2012) ===
The TRC web site (which operated at www.terrorism.com since 1996 and then also mirrored at www.homelandsecurity.com starting in 2000) was the top search engine result for “terrorism” and other security keywords for over a decade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.terrorism.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt; The site regularly received as many as 5,000,000 hits per month and had tens of thousands of active registered users.  The site has also been cited in thousands of books, news articles, academic papers, and other works.

== Major projects (1996 to 2012) ==
The TRC was involved in several major projects, from 1996:&lt;ref name=hist&gt;http://www.terrorism.org/historic-projects/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/02/AR2007110202165_3.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Responder Knowledge Base.
* Terrorism Early Warning Group Expansion Project.
* Mirror Image Training.
* RealNews List.
* Project Pediatric Preparedness.
* Lecture Series.

===Responder Knowledge Base===
The TRC conceived, prototyped, designed, built and operated the RKB over a period of six years.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;  The RKB provided emergency responders, purchasers, and planners with a trusted, integrated, online source of information on products, standards, certifications, grants, and other equipment-related information. The RKB was operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) from 2008 until it was decommissioned in September 2013.

===Terrorism Early Warning Group Expansion Project===
The TRC has worked with the Los Angeles Terrorism Early Warning (TEW) Group since 1997.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://file.lacounty.gov/lasd/cms1_144939.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The TRC and [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] (LASD) submitted a grant application to the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism to expand the Terrorism Early Warning Group concept to six high threat cities in the U.S.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;  The Terrorism Early Warning Group concept fulfills the intelligence requirements outlined in Homeland Security Directive 8: Interim National Preparedness Goal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.devost.net/2005/06/13/utilizing-terrorism-early-warning-groups-to-meet-the-national-preparedness-goal/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.terrorism.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/TEW_and_National_Preparedness_Goal-TRC-May2005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 and the formation of the [[Department of Homeland Security]], the Terrorism Early Warning Group program was migrated to DHS and expanded to cover 56 high threat urban areas.  The TRC worked with these 56 cities to develop early warning and intelligence centers that became the precursor the national Fusion Center network.

===Mirror Image training===
The TRC developed the renowned Mirror Image training program in 2001 to allow military, intelligence, security and first responder personnel to better understand the international terrorist threat.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ooda.com/mirror-image-training/&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants were subjected to an intense immersion program where they were trained to think and act like the adversary and adopt their tactics, techniques, and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/features/10558/&lt;/ref&gt;  TRC Mirror Image training became a U.S. Army Foundry course, was featured in major news media, and became the most popular training course the TRC ever developed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.devost.net/2005/05/20/mirror-image-on-cnn/&lt;/ref&gt;

===RealNews List===
The TRC provided a free daily [[news clipping]] service on a variety of global security issues.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;  An archive of several hundred thousand clippings was available via the TRC web site. The mailing of the TRC free daily news clipping service, became known as the 'early bird of global risk issues'.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

===Project Pediatric Preparedness===
The TRC 'Project Pediatric Preparedness' report responded to emergency preparedness and response planning, technology investments, and training frequently, in respect to the unique requirements of responding to pediatric victims of a larger scale terrorist attack.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riskintel.com/reference-library/?did=647&lt;/ref&gt;
The project explained these unique needs and gaps, and provided a foundation for homeland security planning for pediatric victims of terrorism. The final report described the minimum capabilities essential for emergency response to pediatric victims.&lt;ref name=repfin&gt;http://www.terrorism.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/PPP_Report_Final_4-11-06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The report laid out fifteen Functional Areas for pediatric response – general areas describing functions, tasks, and missions of emergency response. This report is available on the TRC website.&lt;ref name=repfin/&gt;

===Lecture series===
The TRC developed a lecture series, that brought together a wide array of experts to discuss emerging threats.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;  These lectures were then released as audio downloads on the site.  Popular speakers from the lecture series included [[Brian Michael Jenkins]], [[Rohan Gunaratna]], and Hekmat Karzai.

== 2005 U.S. Capitol flag honor ==
In 2005, to honor of TRC’s contributions to the first responder community through the development of the RKB system, it received a U.S. flag that had been flown over the U.S. Capitol building (one of more than 100,000 such flags flown annually).&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Capitol Flags|{{cite web |url=http://www.capitolflags.gov/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527155842/http://www.capitolflags.gov/ |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today==
Early in 2009, none of the TRC founders were still involved with the center.  The Terrorism Research Center ceased operations in 2010 at the discretion of new owners and managers.&lt;br /&gt;
In April 2012, the founders of the TRC announced it was being reconstituted as a non-profit at www.terrorism.org.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2012/04/20/Counter-terror-think-tank-goes-non-profit/UPI-41581334935744/&lt;/ref&gt; The new focus was on sponsoring research publications, and facilitating research. In December 2014, the TRC was included as a collaborating partner with the Microsimulation &amp; Risk Modelling Group at the [[University of Wollongong]]. The project with them is assessing the tactics and counter tactics involved in lone wolf knife attacks on the public.&lt;ref&gt;Microsimulation &amp; Risk Modelling Group (University of Wollongong), Collaborating Partners, International Partners https://uow-mrmg.github.io/collaboration.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012-2013 publications ===
The Terrorism Research Center has initiated sponsorship of new publications in terrorism, and related research areas. The main focus has been research into [[Terrorist Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures]] by its research associates, such as Dr. [[Robert J. Bunker]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Robert-J.-Bunker/e/B0088PBTYA/ref=ntt_dp_epwbk_1&lt;/ref&gt; and Dr. Chris Flaherty.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Christopher-James-Flaherty/e/B001K880TO/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_7?qid=1378463748&amp;sr=1-7&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012-2014 Terrorism Research Center sponsored publications:

[[Image:Maquina.png|thumb|An artistic representation of a [[Turing machine]]. Turing machines are used to model general computing devices.]]

'''Theoretical computer science''' ('''TCS''') is a subset of general [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]] that focuses on more mathematical topics 
of computing and includes the [[theory of computation]].

It is difficult to circumscribe the theoretical areas precisely. The [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]'s [[ACM SIGACT|Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory]] (SIGACT) provides the following description:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =  SIGACT | url = https://www.sigact.org/ | accessdate = 2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{"|TCS covers a wide variety of topics including [[algorithms]], [[data structure]]s, [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]], [[parallel computation|parallel]] and [[distributed computation|distributed]] computation, [[probabilistic computation]], [[quantum computation]], [[automata theory]], [[information theory]], [[cryptography]], [[program semantics]] and [[Formal methods|verification]], [[machine learning]], [[computational biology]], [[computational economics]], [[computational geometry]], and [[computational number theory]] and [[Symbolic computation|algebra]]. Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and [[rigor#Mathematical rigour|rigor]].}}

== History ==
{{Main|History of computer science}}

While logical it is inference and mathematical proof had existed previously, in 1931 [[Kurt Gödel]] proved with his [[incompleteness theorem]] that there are fundamental limitations on what statements could be proved or disproved.

These developments have led to the modern study of logic and [[computability]], and indeed the field of theoretical computer science as a whole{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. [[Information theory]] was added to the field{{by whom|date=September 2017}} with a 1948 mathematical theory of communication by [[Claude Shannon]]. In the same decade, [[Donald Hebb]] introduced a mathematical model of [[Hebbian learning|learning]] in the brain. With mounting biological data supporting this hypothesis with some modification, the fields of [[neural network]]s and [[parallel distributed processing]] were established. In 1971, [[Stephen Cook]] and, working independently, [[Leonid Levin]], proved that there exist practically relevant problems that are [[NP-complete]] &amp;ndash; a landmark result in [[computational complexity theory]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

With the development of [[quantum mechanics]] in the beginning of the 20th century came the concept that mathematical operations could be performed on an entire particle wavefunction. In other words, one could compute functions on multiple states simultaneously. This led to the concept of a [[quantum computer]] in the latter half of the 20th century that took off in the 1990s when [[Peter Shor]] showed that such methods could be used to factor large numbers in [[polynomial time]], which, if implemented, would render most modern [[public key cryptography]] systems uselessly insecure.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2014}}

Modern theoretical computer science research is based on these basic developments, but includes many other mathematical and interdisciplinary problems that have been posed, as shown below:

== Topics ==

===Algorithms===
{{main|Algorithm}}
An [[algorithm]] is a step-by-step procedure for calculations.  Algorithms are used for [[calculation]], [[data processing]], and [[automated reasoning]].

An algorithm is an [[effective method]] expressed as a [[wikt:finite|finite]] list&lt;ref&gt;"Any classical mathematical algorithm, for example, can be described in a finite number of English words" (Rogers 1987:2).&lt;/ref&gt; of well-defined instructions&lt;ref&gt;Well defined with respect to the agent that executes the algorithm: "There is a computing agent, usually human, which can react to the instructions and carry out the computations" (Rogers 1987:2).&lt;/ref&gt; for calculating a [[Function (mathematics)|function]].&lt;ref&gt;"an algorithm is a procedure for computing a ''function'' (with respect to some chosen notation for integers) ... this limitation (to numerical functions) results in no loss of generality", (Rogers 1987:1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps [[null string|empty]]),&lt;ref&gt;"An algorithm has [[zero]] or more inputs, i.e., [[quantity|quantities]] which are given to it initially before the algorithm begins" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; the instructions describe a [[computation]] that, when [[Execution (computing)|executed]], proceeds through a finite&lt;ref&gt;"A procedure which has all the characteristics of an algorithm except that it possibly lacks finiteness may be called a 'computational method'" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output"&lt;ref&gt;"An algorithm has one or more outputs, i.e. quantities which have a specified relation to the inputs" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily [[deterministic]]; some algorithms, known as [[randomized algorithms]], incorporate random input.&lt;ref&gt;Whether or not a process with random interior processes (not including the input) is an algorithm is debatable. Rogers opines that: "a computation is carried out in a discrete stepwise fashion, without use of continuous methods or analogue devices . . . carried forward deterministically, without resort to random methods or devices, e.g., dice" Rogers 1987:2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data structures===
{{main|Data structure}}
A [[data structure]] is a particular way of organizing [[data (computing)|data]] in a computer so that it can be used [[algorithmic efficiency|efficiently]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Black (ed.), entry for ''data structure'' in ''[[Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures]]. U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]. 15 December 2004. [http://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/datastructur.html Online version] Accessed May 21, 2009.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entry ''data structure'' in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (2009) [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/152190/data-structure Online entry] accessed on May 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, databases use [[B-tree]] indexes for small percentages of data retrieval and [[compiler]]s and databases use dynamic [[hash table]]s as look up tables.

Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large [[database]]s and [[web indexing|internet indexing services]]. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient [[algorithm]]s. Some formal design methods and [[programming language]]s emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Storing and retrieving can be carried out on data stored in both [[main memory]] and in [[secondary memory]].

===Computational complexity theory===
{{main|Computational complexity theory}}
[[Computational complexity theory]] is a branch of the [[theory of computation]] that focuses on classifying [[computational problems]] according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those [[Complexity class|classes]] to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an [[algorithm]].

A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the [[algorithm]] used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical [[models of computation]] to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other [[complexity]] measures are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in [[communication complexity]]), the number of [[logic gate|gates]] in a circuit (used in [[circuit complexity]]) and the number of processors (used in [[parallel computing]]). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what [[computer]]s can and cannot do.

===Distributed computation===
{{main|Distributed computation}}
[[Distributed computing]] studies distributed systems. A distributed system is a software system in which components located on [[computer network|networked computers]] communicate and coordinate their actions by [[message passing|passing messages]].&lt;ref name="Coulouris"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coulouris|first=George|author2=Jean Dollimore|author3=Tim Kindberg|author4=Gordon Blair|title=Distributed Systems: Concepts and Design (5th Edition)|publisher = Addison-Wesley|year=2011|location=Boston|isbn=0-132-14301-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components.&lt;ref name="Coulouris"/&gt; Examples of distributed systems vary from [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA-based systems]] to [[massively multiplayer online game]]s to [[Peer-to-peer| peer-to-peer applications]].

A [[computer program]] that runs in a distributed system is called a '''distributed program''', and distributed programming is the process of writing such programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Andrews|2000}}. {{harvtxt|Dolev|2000}}. {{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many alternatives for the message passing mechanism, including [[Remote procedure call|RPC-like]] connectors and [[Message-oriented middleware|message queues]].  An important goal and challenge of distributed systems is [[location transparency]].

===Parallel computation===
{{main|Parallel computation}}
[[Parallel computing]] is a form of [[computing|computation]] in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottlieb|first=Allan|title=Highly parallel computing|year=1989|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings|location=Redwood City, Calif.|isbn=0-8053-0177-1|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=160438|author2=Almasi, George S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; operating on the principle that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which are then solved [[Parallelism (computing)|"in parallel"]]. There are several different forms of parallel computing: [[bit-level parallelism|bit-level]], [[instruction level parallelism|instruction level]], [[data parallelism|data]], and [[task parallelism]]. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in [[high performance computing|high-performance computing]], but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing [[frequency scaling]].&lt;ref&gt;S.V. Adve et al. (November 2008). [http://www.upcrc.illinois.edu/documents/UPCRC_Whitepaper.pdf "Parallel Computing Research at Illinois: The UPCRC Agenda"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209154000/http://www.upcrc.illinois.edu/documents/UPCRC_Whitepaper.pdf |date=2008-12-09 }} (PDF). Parallel@Illinois, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. "The main techniques for these performance benefits&amp;nbsp;– increased clock frequency and smarter but increasingly complex architectures&amp;nbsp;– are now hitting the so-called power wall. The computer industry has accepted that future performance increases must largely come from increasing the number of processors (or cores) on a die, rather than making a single core go faster."&lt;/ref&gt; As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years,&lt;ref&gt;Asanovic et al. Old [conventional wisdom]: Power is free, but transistors are expensive. New [conventional wisdom] is [that] power is expensive, but transistors are "free".&lt;/ref&gt; parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in [[computer architecture]], mainly in the form of [[multi-core processor]]s.&lt;ref name="View-Power"&gt;Asanovic, Krste et al. (December 18, 2006). [http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2006/EECS-2006-183.pdf "The Landscape of Parallel Computing Research: A View from Berkeley"] (PDF). University of California, Berkeley. Technical Report No. UCB/EECS-2006-183. "Old [conventional wisdom]: Increasing clock frequency is the primary method of improving processor performance. New [conventional wisdom]: Increasing parallelism is the primary method of improving processor performance&amp;nbsp;... Even representatives from Intel, a company generally associated with the 'higher clock-speed is better' position, warned that traditional approaches to maximizing performance through maximizing clock speed have been pushed to their limit."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parallel algorithm|Parallel computer programs]] are more difficult to write than sequential ones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hennessy|first=John L.|title=Computer organization and design : the hardware/software interface|year=1999|publisher=Kaufmann|location=San Francisco|isbn=1-55860-428-6|edition=2. ed., 3rd print.|author2=Patterson, David A. |author3=Larus, James R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential [[software bug]]s, of which [[race condition]]s are the most common. [[Computer networking|Communication]] and [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] between the different subtasks are typically some of the greatest obstacles to getting good parallel program performance.

The maximum possible [[speedup|speed-up]] of a single program as a result of parallelization is known as [[Amdahl's law]].

===Very-large-scale integration===
{{main|VLSI}}
[[Very-large-scale integration]] ('''VLSI''') is the process of creating an [[integrated circuit]] (IC) by combining thousands of [[transistors]] into a single chip. VLSI began in the 1970s when complex [[semiconductor]] and [[communication]] technologies were being developed. The [[microprocessor]] is a VLSI device. Before the introduction of VLSI technology most ICs had a limited set of functions they could perform. An [[electronic circuit]] might consist of a [[central processing unit|CPU]], [[Read-only memory|ROM]], [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] and other [[glue logic]]. VLSI allows IC makers to add all of these circuits into one chip.

===Machine learning===
{{main|Machine learning}}
[[Machine learning]] is a [[academic disciplines|scientific discipline]] that deals with the construction and study of [[algorithm]]s that can [[learning|learn]] from data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Glossary of terms |author1=Ron Kovahi |author2=Foster Provost |journal=[[Machine Learning (journal)|Machine Learning]] |volume=30 |pages=271–274 |year=1998 |url=http://ai.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/glossary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such algorithms operate by building a [[Statistical model|model]] based on inputs&lt;ref name="bishop"&gt;{{cite book |author=C. M. Bishop |authorlink=Christopher M. Bishop |year=2006 |title=Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-31073-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} and using that to make predictions or decisions, rather than following only explicitly programmed instructions.

Machine learning can be considered a subfield of computer science and [[statistics]]. It has strong ties to [[artificial intelligence]] and [[mathematical optimization|optimization]], which deliver methods, theory and application domains to the field. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit, rule-based [[algorithm]]s is infeasible. Example applications include [[spam filter]]ing, [[optical character recognition]] (OCR),&lt;ref name=Wernick-Signal-Proc-July-2010&gt;Wernick, Yang, Brankov, Yourganov and Strother, Machine Learning in Medical Imaging, ''[[IEEE Signal Processing Society|IEEE Signal Processing Magazine]]'', vol. 27, no. 4, July 2010, pp. 25-38&lt;/ref&gt; [[Learning to rank|search engines]] and [[computer vision]]. Machine learning is sometimes conflated with [[data mining]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Mannila |first=Heikki |title=Data mining: machine learning, statistics, and databases |conference=Int'l Conf. Scientific and Statistical Database Management |publisher=IEEE Computer Society |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; although that focuses more on exploratory data analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Jerome H. |authorlink=Jerome H. Friedman |title=Data Mining and Statistics: What's the connection? |journal=Computing Science and Statistics |volume=29 |issue=1 |year=1998 |pages=3–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machine learning and [[pattern recognition]] "can be viewed as two facets of
the same field."&lt;ref name="bishop"/&gt;{{rp|vii}}

===Computational biology===
{{main|Computational biology}}
[[Computational biology]] involves the development and application of data-analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques to the study of biological, behavioral, and social systems.&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The field is broadly defined and includes foundations in computer science, [[applied mathematics]], [[animation]], [[statistics]], [[biochemistry]], [[chemistry]], [[biophysics]], [[molecular biology]], [[genetics]], [[genomics]], [[ecology]], [[evolution]], [[anatomy]], [[neuroscience]], and [[scientific visualization|visualization]].&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Computational biology is different from [[biological computation]], which is a subfield of computer science and [[computer engineering]] using [[bioengineering]] and [[biology]] to build [[computer]]s, but is similar to [[bioinformatics]], which is an interdisciplinary science using computers to store and process biological data.

===Computational geometry===
{{main|Computational geometry}}
[[Computational geometry]] is a branch of computer science devoted to the study of algorithms that can be stated in terms of [[geometry]]. Some purely geometrical problems arise out of the study of computational geometric algorithms, and such problems are also considered to be part of computational geometry. While modern computational geometry is a recent development, it is one of the oldest fields of computing with history stretching back to antiquity. An ancient precursor is the [[Sanskrit]] treatise [[Shulba Sutras]], or "Rules of the Chord", that is a book of algorithms written in 800 BCE. The book prescribes step-by-step procedures for constructing geometric objects like altars using a peg and chord.

The main impetus for the development of computational geometry as a discipline was progress in [[computer graphics]] and computer-aided design and manufacturing ([[Computer-aided design|CAD]]/[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]]), but many problems in computational geometry are classical in nature, and may come from [[mathematical visualization]].

Other important applications of computational geometry include [[robotics]] (motion planning and visibility problems), [[geographic information system]]s (GIS) (geometrical location and search, route planning), [[integrated circuit]] design (IC geometry design and verification), [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) (mesh generation), [[computer vision]] (3D reconstruction).

===Information theory===
{{main|Information theory}}
[[Information theory]] is a branch of [[applied mathematics]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[computer science]] involving the [[Quantification (science)|quantification]] of [[information]].  Information theory was developed by [[Claude E. Shannon]] to find fundamental limits on [[signal processing]] operations such as [[data compression|compressing data]] and on reliably [[Computer data storage|storing]] and [[Telecommunication|communicating]] data. Since its inception it has broadened to find applications in many other areas, including [[statistical inference]], [[natural language processing]], [[cryptography]], [[neurobiology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=F. Rieke |author2=D.

Applications of fundamental topics of information theory include [[lossless data compression]] (e.g. [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP files]]), [[lossy data compression]] (e.g. [[MP3]]s and [[JPEG]]s), and [[channel capacity|channel coding]] (e.g. for [[DSL|Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)]]).  The field is at the intersection of [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[computer science]], [[physics]], [[neurobiology]], and [[electrical engineering]]. Its impact has been crucial to the success of the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] missions to deep space, the invention of the compact disc, the feasibility of mobile phones, the development of the [[Internet]], the study of [[linguistics]] and of human perception, the understanding of [[black hole]]s, and numerous other fields. Important sub-fields of information theory are [[source coding]], [[channel coding]], [[algorithmic complexity theory]], [[algorithmic information theory]], [[information-theoretic security]], and measures of information.

===Cryptography===
{{main|Cryptography}}
[[Cryptography]]  is the practice and study of techniques for [[secure communication]] in the presence of third parties (called [[adversary (cryptography)|adversaries]]).&lt;ref name="rivest90"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ronald L.|last=Rivest|authorlink=Ron Rivest|editor=J. Van Leeuwen|title=Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science|chapter=Cryptology|volume=1|publisher=Elsevier|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, it is about constructing and analyzing [[communications protocol|protocol]]s that overcome the influence of adversaries&lt;ref name="modern-crypto"&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Mihir|last1=Bellare|first2=Phillip|last2=Rogaway|title=Introduction to Modern Cryptography|chapter=Introduction|page=10|date=21 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that are related to various aspects in [[information security]] such as data [[confidentiality]], [[data integrity]], [[authentication]], and [[non-repudiation]].&lt;ref name="hac"&gt;{{cite book |first=A. J. |last=Menezes |first2=P. C. |last2=van Oorschot |first3=S. A. |last3=Vanstone |url=http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/ |title=Handbook of Applied Cryptography |publisher= |isbn=0-8493-8523-7 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307081354/http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/ |archivedate=2005-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern cryptography intersects the disciplines of [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], and [[electrical engineering]]. Applications of cryptography include [[automated teller machine|ATM cards]], [[password|computer passwords]], and [[electronic commerce]].

Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around [[computational hardness assumption]]s, making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary. It is theoretically possible to break such a system, but it is infeasible to do so by any known practical means. These schemes are therefore termed computationally secure; theoretical advances, e.g., improvements in [[integer factorization]] algorithms, and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted. There exist [[Information theoretic security|information-theoretically secure]] schemes that {{not a typo|provably}} cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power—an example is the [[one-time pad]]—but these schemes are more difficult to implement than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms.

===Quantum computation===
{{main|Quantum computation}}
A [[quantum computer]] is a [[computation]] system that makes direct use of [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] [[phenomena]], such as [[quantum superposition|superposition]] and [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]], to perform [[Instruction (computer science)|operations]] on [[data]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://cba.mit.edu/docs/papers/98.06.sciqc.pdf Quantum Computing with Molecules]" article in ''[[Scientific American]]'' by [[Neil Gershenfeld]] and [[Isaac L. Chuang]]&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum computers are different from digital computers based on [[transistor]]s. Whereas digital computers require data to be encoded into binary digits ([[bit]]s), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses [[qubits]] (quantum bits), which can be in [[quantum superposition|superpositions]] of states. A theoretical model is the [[quantum Turing machine]], also known as the universal quantum computer.  Quantum computers share theoretical similarities with [[Non-deterministic Turing machine|non-deterministic]] and [[probabilistic automaton|probabilistic computers]]; one example is the ability to be in more than one state simultaneously.  The field of quantum computing was first introduced by [[Yuri Manin]] in 1980&lt;ref name="manin1980vychislimoe"&gt;{{cite book| author=Manin, Yu. I.| title=Vychislimoe i nevychislimoe| trans-title=Computable and Noncomputable| year=1980| publisher=Sov.Radio| url=http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/M/MANIN_Yuriy_Ivanovich/Manin_Yu.I._Vychislimoe_i_nevychislimoe.(1980).%5Bdjv%5D.zip| pages=13–15| language=Russian| accessdate=4 March 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510173823/http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/M/MANIN_Yuriy_Ivanovich/Manin_Yu.I._Vychislimoe_i_nevychislimoe.(1980).%5Bdjv%5D.zip| archivedate=10 May 2013| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Feynman]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="Feynman82"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feynman |first=R. P. |title=Simulating physics with computers |journal=[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] |year=1982 |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=467–488 |doi=10.1007/BF02650179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Quantum computation |authorlink=David Deutsch |first=David |last=Deutsch |journal=Physics World |date=1992-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A quantum computer with spins as quantum bits was also formulated for use as a quantum [[space–time]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Finkelstein |chapter=Space-Time Structure in High Energy Interactions |title=Fundamental Interactions at High Energy |editor1-first=T. |editor1-last=Gudehus |editor2-first=G. |editor2-last=Kaiser |location=New York |publisher=Gordon &amp; Breach |year=1968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2014}}, quantum computing is still in its infancy but experiments have been carried out in which quantum computational operations were executed on a very small number of qubits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-01-qubit-bodes-future-quantum.html|title=New qubit control bodes well for future of quantum computing|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both practical and theoretical research continues, and many national governments and military funding agencies support quantum computing research to develop quantum [[computer]]s for both civilian and national security purposes, such as [[cryptanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://qist.lanl.gov/qcomp_map.shtml Quantum Information Science and Technology Roadmap] for a sense of where the research is heading.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information-based complexity===
{{main|Information-based complexity}}
Information-based complexity (IBC) studies optimal algorithms and computational complexity for continuous problems. IBC has studied continuous problems as path integration, partial differential equations, systems of ordinary differential equations, nonlinear equations, integral equations, fixed points, and very-high-dimensional integration.

===Computational number theory===
{{main|Computational number theory}}
[[Computational number theory]], also known as '''algorithmic number theory''', is the study of [[algorithm]]s for performing [[number theory|number theoretic]] [[computation]]s. The best known problem in the field is [[integer factorization]].

===Symbolic computation===
{{main|Symbolic computation}}
[[Computer algebra]], also called symbolic computation or algebraic computation is a scientific area that refers to the study and development of [[algorithm]]s and [[software]] for manipulating [[expression (mathematics)|mathematical expressions]] and other [[mathematical object]]s. Although, properly speaking, computer algebra should be a subfield of [[scientific computing]], they are generally considered as distinct fields because scientific computing is usually based on [[numerical computation]] with approximate [[floating point number]]s, while symbolic computation emphasizes ''exact'' computation with expressions containing [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s that have not any given value and are thus manipulated as symbols (therefore the name of ''symbolic computation'').

[[Software]] applications that perform symbolic calculations are called ''[[computer algebra system]]s'', with the term ''system'' alluding to the complexity of the main applications  that include, at least, a method to represent mathematical data in a computer, a user programming language (usually different from the language used for the implementation), a dedicated memory manager, a [[user interface]] for the input/output of mathematical expressions, a large set of [[function (computer science)|routines]] to perform usual operations, like simplification of expressions, [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]] using [[chain rule]], [[polynomial factorization]], [[indefinite integration]], etc.

===Program semantics===
{{main|Program semantics}}
In [[programming language theory]], '''semantics''' is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of [[programming language]]s. It does so by evaluating the meaning of [[programming language syntax|syntactically]] legal [[String (computer science)|strings]] defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically illegal strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will execute on a certain [[computer platform|platform]], hence creating a [[model of computation]].

===Formal methods===
{{main|Formal methods}}
[[Formal methods]] are a particular kind of [[mathematics]] based techniques for the [[formal specification|specification]], development and [[formal verification|verification]] of [[software]] and [[computer hardware|hardware]] systems.&lt;ref name="butler"&gt;{{cite web|author=R. W. Butler|title=What is Formal Methods?|url=http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/fm-what.html|date=2001-08-06|accessdate=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. Michael Holloway|title=Why Engineers Should Consider Formal Methods|url=http://klabs.org/richcontent/verification/holloway/nasa-97-16dasc-cmh.pdf|publisher=16th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (27–30 October 1997)|accessdate=2006-11-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116210448/http://klabs.org/richcontent/verification/holloway/nasa-97-16dasc-cmh.pdf|archivedate=16 November 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals, in particular [[logic in computer science|logic]] calculi, [[formal language]]s, [[automata theory]], and [[program semantics]], but also [[type systems]] and [[algebraic data types]] to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.&lt;ref&gt;Monin, pp.3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automata theory===
{{main|Automata theory}}
[[Automata theory]] is the study of ''[[abstract machine]]s'' and ''[[automaton|automata]]'', as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them. It is a theory in theoretical computer science, under [[Discrete mathematics]] (a section of [[Mathematics]] and also of [[Computer Science]]). ''Automata'' comes from the Greek word αὐτόματα meaning "self-acting".

Automata Theory is the study of self-operating virtual machines to help in logical understanding of input and output process, without or with intermediate stage(s) of [[computation]] (or any [[Function (engineering)|function]] / process).

===Coding theory===
{{main|Coding theory}}
[[Coding theory]] is the study of the properties of codes and their fitness for a specific application. Codes are used for [[data compression]], [[cryptography]], [[error-correction]] and more recently also for [[network coding]]. Codes are studied by various scientific disciplines—such as [[information theory]], [[electrical engineering]],  [[mathematics]], and [[computer science]]—for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable [[data transmission]] methods. This typically involves the removal of redundancy and the correction (or detection) of errors in the transmitted data.

===Computational learning theory===
{{main|Computational learning theory}}
Theoretical results in machine learning mainly deal with a type of
inductive learning called supervised learning.  In supervised
learning, an algorithm is given samples that are labeled in some
useful way.  For example, the samples might be descriptions of
mushrooms, and the labels could be whether or not the mushrooms are
edible.  The algorithm takes these previously labeled samples and
uses them to induce a classifier.  This classifier is a function that
assigns labels to samples including the samples that have never been
previously seen by the algorithm.  The goal of the supervised learning
algorithm is to optimize some measure of performance such as
minimizing the number of mistakes made on new samples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4542">'''Turkey City Writer's Workshop''' is a peer-to-peer, professional science fiction writer's workshop in Texas.  Founded in 1973 and still ongoing today, it was consciously modeled after the east coast [[Milford Writer's Workshop]].&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;[http://home.roadrunner.com/~lperson1/TC.html The Turkey City Writer's Workshop Homepage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323060310/http://home.roadrunner.com/~lperson1/TC.html |date=March 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The workshop "was a cradle of cyberpunk"&lt;ref name="lexicon"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Sterling | first = Bruce | authorlink = Bruce Sterling |author2=Lewis Shiner  | title = Turkey City Lexicon: A Primer for SF Workshops | publisher = SFWA | url = http://www.sfwa.org/2009/06/turkey-city-lexicon-a-primer-for-sf-workshops/ | accessdate = 2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; where many of the practitioners of what would become cyberpunk first met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Swanwick | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Swanwick | title = A User's Guide to the Postmoderns | journal = Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine | pages = 24 |date=August 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founding members of the group included [[Lisa Tuttle]], [[Howard Waldrop]], [[Steven Utley]], and [[Tom Reamy]].  The workshop was first held in [[Grand Prairie, Texas]], but soon shifted to [[Austin]] when most of the writers involved moved there during the mid-1970s. [[Bruce Sterling]] was one of the youngest members of the workshop when he joined it in 1974.&lt;ref name="dmn971109"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lambert et al. 2005.

{{confuse|international community}}

The term '''world community''' is used primarily in [[political]] and [[humanitarian]] contexts to describe an international aggregate of [[nation states]] of widely varying types. In most connotations, the term is used to convey meanings attached to consensus or inclusion of all people in all lands and their governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meister|first=Charles W.|date=1964|title=The Concept of World Community|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00131726409340084?journalCode=utef20|journal=The Educational Forum|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=291–296|doi=10.1080/00131726409340084|issn=0013-1725|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
World community often is a semi-personal rhetorical connotation that represents Humanity in a singular context as in "…for the sake of the World Community" or "…with the approval of the World Community". 

The term sometimes is used to reference the [[United Nations]] or its affiliated agencies as bodies of governance. Other times it is a generic term with no explicit ties to states or governments but retaining a political connotation.

==Humanitarianism==
In terms of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|human needs]], [[humanitarian aid]], [[human rights]], and other discourse in the [[humanities]], the world community is akin to the conceptual [[Global village (Internet)|Global village]] aimed at the inclusion of non-aligned countries, aboriginal peoples, the [[Third World]] into the ''connected'' world via the communications infrastructure or at least representative ties to it.

==Economics==
In terms of the [[global economy]], the ''world community'' is seen by some economists as an inter-dependent system of goods and services with semi-permeable boundaries and flexible sets of import/export rules. Proponents of [[Globalization]] may tend to establish or impose more rigidity to this framework. Controversy has arisen as to whether this paradigm will strengthen or weaken the world as a community. See [[World Trade Organization]]

==Ecology==
When considering [[Sustainable development]] and [[Ecology]], the inter-dependence angle generally expands quickly to a Global context. In this paradigm, the planet as a whole represents a single [[Biome]] and the World's population represents the [[Ecological succession]] in a singular [[eco-system]]. This also can be recognized as the World Community.

==Religion==
Many religions have taken on the challenge of establishing a world community through the propagation of their doctrine, faith and practice.

In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], successor and son of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], produced a series of documents called the [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]. Now in a book form, after their publication in 1917 and their 'unveiling' in New York in 1919, these tablets contained an outline and a plan for the expansion of the Bahá'í community into Asia, Asia minor, Europe and the Americas, indeed, throughout the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation|title=Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation|website=bahai-library.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The formal implementation of this plan, known as 'Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan, began in 1937 in the first of a series of sub-plans, the Seven Year Plan of 1937 to 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=lF0UquZAZW8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Bahá'í: The Religious Construction of a Global Identity|last=McMullen|first=Michael|date=2000|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=|isbn=9780813528366|location=|pages=206|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shoghi Effendi]], the leader of the Baha'i community until 1957 and then the [[Universal House of Justice]] from 1963, were instrumental in the organization and design of future sub-plans. This lead to the creation and establishment of a world community, with members of the faith estimated to have reached 5 to 6 million in the early 21st century, while also being the second most geographically widespread religion in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/countries-with-the-largest-baha-i-populations.html|title=Countries With The Largest Bahá'i Populations|work=WorldAtlas|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Buddhism "the conventional Sangha of monks has been entrusted by the Buddha with the task of leading all people in creating the ideal world community of noble disciples or truly civilized people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha062.htm|title=Sangha: The Ideal World  Community|website=www.budsas.org|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Benedictine monk, Friar John Main, inspired the World Community for [[Christian meditation]] through the practice of meditation centered around the [[Maranatha]] mantra, meaning "Come Lord."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wccm.org/content/john-main|title=John Main {{!}} WCCM|website=www.wccm.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lutheran Church in America had issued a social statement - ''World Community: Ethical Imperatives in an Age of Interdependence'' Adopted by the Fifth Biennial Convention, Minneapolis, Minnesota, June 25-July 2, 1970. Since then The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has formed and retained the statement as a 'historical document'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=-ZPsISqdV5cC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Restructuring of American Religion: Society and Faith Since World War II|last=Wuthnow|first=Robert|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=|isbn=0691020574|location=|pages=251|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World peace==
{{Main|World peace}}
The term world community is often used in the context of establishing and maintaining world peace through a peace process or through a resolvable end to local-regional wars and global-world wars. Many social movements and much political theory deals with issues revolving around the institutionalization of the process of propagating the ideal of a world community.  A world community is one which has a global vision, is established throughout the world, that is it has a membership that exists in most of the countries on the planet and that involves the participation of its members in a variety of ways.
