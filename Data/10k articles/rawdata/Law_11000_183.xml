      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3750">'''Allosemitism''' is a neologism used to encompass both [[philo-Semitic]] and [[anti-Semitic]] attitudes towards Jews as [[Other (philosophy)|other]].

==Origin of term==

The term was coined by Polish [[literary critic]] [[Artur Sandauer]] and popularized by Polish sociologist [[Zygmunt Bauman]]. Sandauer used the term "allosemitism" in his essay ''On Situation of Polish Writer of Jewish Descent In the 20th Century'' published as a book in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Artur Sandauer, O sytuacji pisarza polskiego pochodzenia żydowskiego w XX wieku (Rzecz, którą nie ja powinienem był napisać...) (Warszawa: Czytelnik, 1982, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zygmunt Bauman]] proposed the term in his 1997 essay "Allosemitism: Premodern, Modern, Postmodern",” in which he argued  that "allosemitism" should be used in place of "[[anti-semitism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Zygmunt Bauman, “Allosemitism: Premodern, Modern, Postmodern,” in Modernity, Culture, and “the Jew,” ed. Bryan Cheyette and Laura Marcus (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Bauman's argument is that allosemitism can represent a “radically ambivalent attitude,” that encompassing both [[Philo-Semitism]] and anti-Semitism;&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Valerie. "Dissolving Boundaries: Assimilation and Allosemitism in E. A. Dupont's "Das Alte Gesetz" (1923) and Veit Harlan's "Jud Süss" (1940)." The German Quarterly 78.4 (2005): 496-516.&lt;/ref&gt; allosemitism is a form of [[proteophobia]], fear and horror of things that defy clean-cut categories, not, like antisemitism, of a simple fear of the "[[Other (philosophy)|other]]" ([[heterophobia]]); and that Judeophobia is diverse, and, therefore, not adequately encompassed by the term antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Frojmovic. Review of Kessler, Herbert L.; Nirenberg, David, eds., Judaism and Christian Art: Aesthetic Anxieties from the Catacombs to Colonialism, 
H-Judaic, H-Net Reviews. March, 2013. [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=32937]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ruth Gruber]] describes the neologism as a response to "the idea that, good or bad, Jews are different from the non-Jewish mainstream and thus unable to be dealt with in the same way or measured by the same yardstick."&lt;ref name=GruberOther&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gruber|first1=Ruth|title=Allosemitism (noun)—Jews as the perpetual ‘other’|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/world/article/allosemitism_noun_jews_as_the_perpetual_other_20080807|accessdate=10 August 2016|publisher=Jewish Journal|date=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Gruber, the term was coined by Polish-Jewish literary critic [[Artur Sandauer]].&lt;ref name=GruberOther/&gt;

In her 2010 book ''Modernism, Feminism, and Jewishness'', literary scholar Maren Tova Linnett describes the term as originated by both Sandauer and Bauman.&lt;ref&gt;Briefel, Aviva. "Allosemitic Modernism." NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction 43, no. 2 (2010): 361-63. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40959717.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use== 

Linnett uses the term "to describe the multiple modes of difference that these women authors ascribed to the Jew in order to complicate what she views as the overly simplistic polarities of anti-Semitism and philo-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;Briefel, Aviva. "Allosemitic Modernism." NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction 43, no. 2 (2010): 361-63. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40959717.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Eliezer Ben-Rafael]] employs the concept in his 2014 book ''Confronting Allosemitism in Europe: The Case of Belgian Jews.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1106">'''The American Civics Test''', or U.S. Civics Test / U.S. Citizenship Test, is an examination that all immigrants must pass to gain United States citizenship. All high school students must also pass the students' civics test before graduation.
  
The test is prepared in English and the candidate must score at least 60 percent for a successful pass. There are 100 civics questions that cover various topics in U.S. history, constitution and government. For the naturalization process the applicant will be asked 10 randomly selection questions. For high school graduation the test comprises all 100 questions.

[[Arizona]] became the first state requiring students to pass the civics test before high school graduation. It is expected that all states will have implemented this requirement by September 17, 2017, the 230th anniversary of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/arizona-passes-law-requiring-students-pass-civics-test-231736007.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arizona State Mine Inspector''' is the inspector of active and inactive mines in the state of [[Arizona]], in the United States. It is an independent, constitutionally mandated office, elected by the people of the state to a four-year term.

Arizona has 600 working mines and an estimated 120,000 abandoned mines.&lt;ref&gt;http://tucson.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/race-for-state-mine-inspector-open-for-first-time-in/article_f430a4a8-8949-5951-ab13-08e5758c64ef.html&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the state had only 4 employees who actually inspected mines. Arizona is the only state with an elected mine inspector in the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://kjzz.org/content/5178/arizona-mine-inspectors-office-tries-climb-out-deep-financial-hole&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have questioned whether Arizona should continue to elect its mine inspector.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/opinion/article_40c4dcc3-5244-5bb2-992f-f225fcccdeed.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azleg.gov//FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/legtext/52leg/2r/bills/hcr2003o.asp&amp;Session_ID=115&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, former inspector Douglas K. Martin was convicted of a felony conflict of interest from the illegal use of state vehicles and theft.&lt;ref&gt;http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue/2007/03/15/45055-former-state-mine-inspector-pleads-guilty-to-felony-charge/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12645">In Old [[English law]], a '''Bowbearer''' was an under-officer of the [[forest]] who looked after all manner of trespass on vert or venison, and who attached, or caused to be attached, the offenders, in the feudal [[Court of Attachment]].

The [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] was a renowned English weapon, made of wood from the [[taxus|yew]] tree.

== Examples of the role==

The best-documented example of Bowbearers in England is to be found in the [[Forest of Bowland]] in north-eastern Lancashire.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge History of the Lordship of Bowland {{cite web |url=http://www.forestofbowland.com/files/uploads/MartinsBlog/ESC%20SPEC%20WITH%20CORRECTIONS.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711021334/http://www.forestofbowland.com/files/uploads/MartinsBlog/ESC%20SPEC%20WITH%20CORRECTIONS.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late twelfth century, Oughtred de Bolton, son of Edwin de Bolton ("Edwinus Comes de Boelton" in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'') is described as an early Bowbearer in the royal forests of Bowland and [[Gilsland]], at the time of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]].  However, this account is flawed as the possibility of Oughtred being the son of Edwin is fanciful and cannot be substantiated.  It would have been impossible for Oughtred to have been Bowbearer of [[Gilsland]] before the 1170s when the barony was first brought into the Norman realm.

Perhaps the most notorious Bowbearer of the Forest of Bowland was Sir Nicholas Tempest, who was executed at [[Tyburn]] in 1537. Tempest was one of the northern leaders of the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], the Catholic uprising against [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and was linked to [[Sawley Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Hoyle, ''The Pilgrimage of Grace and the Politics of the 1530s'' (Oxford University Press: Oxford 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=77124|title=Tempest family|first=R. W.|last=Hoyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parker family===

The Parker family were the Bowbearers of the [[Forest of Bowland]] from the time of the [[English Restoration]] in 1660.&lt;ref&gt;Baines' History of Lanc., Vol. III.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;for example: [http://www.gisburn.org.uk/gisburnvillage/ribblesdales2.htm] "hereditary in his family for many generations" (as at 1779) and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080505224712/http://www.forestofbowland.com/visit_attractions_interest.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; The family likes to claim the office traces back as far as Robert Parker in the early 16th century but this is difficult to substantiate given the available evidence.  In reality, while the family did have Bowbearers over many generations between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, the office was always granted to them by their local lord, the [[Lord of Bowland]], the so-called [[Lord of the Fells]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forestofbowland.com/node/1864 Forest of Bowland official website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Rural Life | date= November 2014| url= http://www.forestofbowland.com/files/uploads/pdfs/lord_bowland.pdf |title= Lord of the Fells, Guardian of History}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Parker hereditary claim appears to have been concocted in the early part of the nineteenth century by [[Thomas Lister Parker]], a socially ambitious individual who wished to make a mark in London society. Thomas Lister Parker eventually bankrupted himself due to his various extravagances but not before he had corrupted the historical record.  Both Whitaker's and Baines' accounts of the history of Bowland bear witness to that corruption. The last known Bowbearer of the [[Forest of Bowland]] was Richard Eastwood of Thorneyholme, an acclaimed breeder of racehorses and shorthorn cattle and land agent to John Towneley, 13th [[Lord of Bowland]]. Eastwood died in 1871 and is buried at St Hubert's, [[Dunsop Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.browsholme.co.uk [[Browsholme Hall]] – Home of the Parker Family for over 500 years&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Lord of Bowland's courts at [[Whitewell]] that appointed the Bowbearers fell into disuse in the first half of the nineteenth century, it was reported in April 2010 that [[William Bowland, 16th Lord of Bowland|William Bowland]], 16th [[Lordship of Bowland|Lord of Bowland]] had  re-asserted his ancient right and appointed Robert Parker of [[Browsholme Hall]] his Bowbearer of the Forest of Bowland, the first Parker to be so appointed in more than 150 years.&lt;ref&gt;Forest of Bowland official website http://www.forestofbowland.com/node/1923 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711021123/http://www.forestofbowland.com/node/1923 |date=2011-07-11 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lancashire Evening Post http://www.lep.co.uk/news/Ancient-titles-rise-again.6200640.jp{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clitheroe Advertiser http://www.clitheroeadvertiser.co.uk/valleynews/First-39Bowbearer-of-the-Forest39.6229215.jp&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011, Robert Parker led a party of dignitaries from the [[Bowland Forest High|Bowland Higher]] Division Parish Council, the Forest authorities, and local community, to welcome the 16th Lord of Bowland to [[Dunsop Bridge]] on his first official visit to the [[Forest of Bowland|Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fnews.az/content/making-every-bowlander-proud-lord-bowland-official-visit Lord of Bowland official visit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110418003451/http://fnews.az/content/making-every-bowlander-proud-lord-bowland-official-visit |date=April 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Sign for the Times {{cite web|url=http://www.forestofbowland.com/node/2656 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928205034/http://www.forestofbowland.com/node/2656 |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, Robert Parker was formally presented with his Bowbearer's "wand of office" by the 16th [[Lord of Bowland]] at a public ceremony in Slaidburn. This ceremony marked the 90th anniversary of the final meeting of the manorial court at the town's Tudor courthouse.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.browsholme.co.uk/downloads/Oct%202012%20Lord%20King%20of%20Bowland%20flyer.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other English Bowbearers==

Other notable examples of Bowbearers in England include those appointed in the Forests of Delamere, Hatfield, and Mashamshire.

In 1513, a Richard Done of [[Utkington]] is described as the hereditary Bowbearer of [[Delamere, Cheshire|Delamere]].&lt;ref&gt;From ''[[Macclesfield|MACKLESFELDE]] IN YE OLDEN TIME'', Ch. 8, by Isaac Finny, said to be "reprinted from the Macclesfield Advertiser" in 1873.

In 1605, Sir [[Robert Swift]] of [[Streetthorpe]] ([[Edenthorpe]]) was appointed Bowbearer to the [[Royal Chase]] of [[Hatfield Forest|Hatfield]] by [[James I of England|James I]].&lt;ref name="yew1"&gt;[http://www.ancient-yew.org/doncasteryews.shtml Historic Trees of the Doncaster Region – Ancient Yew trees in the Doncaster Landscape&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A local tradition in that area states that the many [[taxus|yew]] trees of the region were planted as a result, to provide wood for bows.&lt;ref name="yew1" /&gt; The Complete [[Shakespeare]] Encyclopedia by Carol Enos also states that "[[Alvanley Hall]], the property of William Arden, Baron [[Alvanley]], has been abandoned as the residence of the family for nearly a century and a half, and little of the house remains.  Lord Alvanley is hereditary Bowbearer of the [[Forest of Delamere]], and possesses the ancient bugle horn by which his ancestors have held that office almost from the period of the Norman Invasion” (Chetham Society,Vol I, 331)." &lt;ref&gt;http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~finney/isaac/macklesfelde-in-ye-olden-time.htm – online copy&lt;/ref&gt; {{Verify source|date=December 2007}}

In 1632, Sir [[Armytage baronets|Francis Armitage]] of [[Kirklees]], was appointed Bowbearer of the [[Free Chase]] of [[Mashamshire]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/Misc/MIs/ARY/YorkMinsterBurials1a.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116191246/http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/Misc/MIs/ARY/YorkMinsterBurials1a.html |date=2008-01-16 }} – burial register of [[York Minster]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The bowbearer is not a uniquely English phenomenon.

A '''cabinet crisis''' or '''government crisis''' is a situation when the [[government]] is challenged before the [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] period expires, because it threatens to resign over a proposal, or it is at risk at being dismissed after a [[motion of no confidence]], a conflict between the parties in a [[coalition government]] or a [[coup d'état]]. It may also be the result of there being no clear majority willing to work together to form a government.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} During this period a [[caretaker government]] with a limited mandate may take care of the day-to-day affairs of the state, while waiting for a [[snap election]].

'''Caltex Woolworths''' was an [[Australia]]n chain of petrol station, operated by [[Caltex#Australia|Caltex Australia]] and [[Woolworths Limited]] in a joint venture. In [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], it traded as '''Caltex Safeway''' until Woolworths scrapped the name in late 2008. Sold to Euro Garages in Late 2018.

As of end of financial year 2015, there are 516 Woolworths-operated sites and about 100 Caltex-operated Star Mart/Star Shop sites which accept Woolworths fuel discounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Annual Report 2015 |url=http://www.woolworthslimited.com.au/annualreport/2015/files/Woolworths_AR_2015.pdf |publisher=[[Woolworths Limited]] |date=11 September 2015 |accessdate=30 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ev5GBGMa?url=http://www.woolworthslimited.com.au/annualreport/2015/files/Woolworths_AR_2015.pdf |archivedate=30 January 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caltex2014" /&gt;

In December 2016, Woolworths announced it had agreed to sell its own operated sites to [[BP]] for AU$1.75 billion, and would enter into a franchise agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-28/woolworths-sells-fuel-business-to-bp-for-1.8b/8150610|title=Woolworths sells fuel business to BP for nearly $1.8b|date=2016-12-28|newspaper=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Caltex Woolworths.jpg|thumb|Caltex Woolworths station in [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales]]]]
Woolworths' foray into the petrol business began in 1996 with a Woolworths Plus Petrol station in [[Dubbo]], [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Story |url=http://www.woolworthspetrol.com.au/about-us/our-story.html |publisher=Woolworths Petrol |accessdate=30 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ev1bdE8S?url=http://www.woolworthspetrol.com.au/about-us/our-story.html |archivedate=30 January 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Woolworths announced a joint venture with [[Caltex]]. Caltex would supply fuel to the outlets and they would be co-branded.  All Woolworths Petrol and selected Caltex sites near Woolworths supermarkets were rebranded accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woolies and Caltex join forces |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2003-08-21/woolies-and-caltex-join-forces/1467892 |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=22 August 2003 |accessdate=30 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ev1p8CQv?url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2003-08-21/woolies-and-caltex-join-forces/1467892 |archivedate=30 January 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woolworths, Caltex finalise petrol deal |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/04/28/1083103526412.html |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=28 April 2004 |accessdate=30 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ev1xLctb?url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/04/28/1083103526412.html |archivedate=30 January 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2014, Woolworths and Caltex revised the terms of their alliance, with the changes affecting the 131 Caltex-operated sites. 92 of the sites would be rebranded as either as [[Caltex#Convenience stores|Star Mart]] or Star Shop convenience stores while continuing to accept the Woolworths fuel discount redemption while the remainder would exit the Caltex–Woolworths alliance entirely.&lt;ref name="caltex2014"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Changes to Caltex-Woolworths alliance |url=http://www.caltex.com.au/LatestNews/Pages/NewsItem.aspx?ID=13491 |publisher=[[Caltex Australia]] |date=20 November 2014 |accessdate=30 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203145127/http://www.caltex.com.au/LatestNews/Pages/NewsItem.aspx?ID=13491 |archivedate=3 February 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Woolworths announced it would sell its own operated sites to BP for AU$1.75 billion, and would enter into a franchise agreement to retain its branded stores at the sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Westbrook|first1=Tom|title=Australia's Woolworths sells petrol chain to BP for $1.3 billion|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-woolworths-bp-sale-idUKKBN14G1P4|accessdate=28 December 2016|agency=Reuters|date=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new format under the brand "Metro at BP" is planned to be introduced for up to 200 sites. The sale, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, is due to be completed by 2 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Woolworths to sell fuel business and enter strategic partnership with BP|url=http://www.woolworthsgroup.com.au/page/media/Latest_News/woolworths-to-sell-fuel-business-and-enter-strategic-partnership-with-bp/|publisher=Woolworths Group|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the final quarter of 2017, this deal was blocked. BP and Woolworths are still finalising the deal, so it would be accepted and proceed in the future.

==Fuel discount offer==
Caltex Woolworths offers a 4¢ per litre discount off the pump price for customers who present a docket, obtained after spending a qualifying amount of $30 or more at [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]] and [[Safeway (Australia)|Safeway]] supermarkets and Tasmanian [[Big W]] department stores (Previously nationwide; mainland [[Big W]] stores stopped issuing fuel dockets in September 2010).

The offer initially involved an escalating scale of discount off the price of petrol, depending on the amount spent to qualify – $30.00-$59.99 for 2¢ per litre, $60.00-$149.99 for 4¢ per litre, and $150.00 and above for 6¢ per litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title = SENATE – Legislation | booktitle = Official Committee Hansard | pages = 107 | publisher = Commonwealth of Australia Rural And Regional Affairs And Transport | date = 12 March 1999 | location = Canberra | url = http://wopared.aph.gov.au/hansard/senate/commttee/s2163.pdf | doi =  | id =  | accessdate = 17 September 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070908070838/http://wopared.aph.gov.au/hansard/senate/commttee/s2163.pdf | archivedate = 8 September 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the offer eventually settled on a median 4¢ per litre discount with purchases of $30.00 and over, after the launch of rival [[Coles Group|Coles]]' equivalent fuel discount offer through [[Coles Express]] service stations in 2003.

The 4¢ per litre discount is doubled to 8¢ if a petrol buyer also purchases goods to the value of at least $5 at the petrol station convenience store and pays for both petrol and goods in the same transaction.

In 2008, Woolworths launched its [[Woolworths Rewards]] loyalty card. With the card, customers can obtain their fuel discount vouchers by swiping their cards at Woolworths, Safeway and Big W (Tasmania only) checkouts nationwide and then redeem the discount by swiping their cards at Caltex Woolworths petrol stations.

The '''''Canada–France Maritime Boundary Case''''' was a 1992 dispute between [[Canada]] and [[France]] that was decided by an [[Arbitration#Arbitration with sovereign governments|arbitral tribunal]] created by the parties to resolve the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;The case decision and the two dissents were printed in 31 ''International Legal Materials'' (ILM) 1149 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; The case established the extent of the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] of the French territory of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Ewan W. (2003). ''International Boundaries: A Geopolitical Atlas,'' p. 288; Charney, Jonathan I. ''et al.'' (2005). ''International Maritime Boundaries,''  pp. 2141–2158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1972, Canada and France signed a [[treaty]] that [[boundary delimitation|delimited]] the territorial [[maritime boundary]] between Canada and the French territory of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]. However, the maritime boundaries beyond the territorial sea (including extent of the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]]s (EEZ) of both countries) continued to be disputed. The extent of each country's EEZ was significant because it would determine where the countries had an exclusive right to fish. Years of failed negotiations led Canada and France to agree in March 1989 to establish an ad hoc arbitral tribunal that would resolve the dispute.

==Arbitral tribunal==
The [[arbitral tribunal]] was composed of five arbitrators—three neutral parties and one representative from each country. The neutral arbitrators were [[Eduardo Jiménez de Aréchaga]] of [[Uruguay]] (president), Gaetano Arangio-Ruiz of [[Italy]], and [[Oscar Schachter]] of the [[United States]]. Canada's representative was [[Allan Gotlieb]] and France's was [[Prosper Weil]].

==Decision==
The arbitral tribunal issued its decision and award on 10 June 1992. It was a 3–2 decision, with the representatives of both Canada and France dissenting from the decision. The zone that was awarded to France was unusual and in two parts: first, the boundary was set at an equidistant line between the French islands and the Canadian island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Added to this was a 24 nautical mile bulge on the west of the islands. Lastly, a long north–south {{convert|188|nmi|km|adj=on}} corridor south of the islands was awarded to France, presumably to allow France access to its EEZ from international waters without having to pass through the Canadian EEZ. The corridor is narrow, being approximately 10½ nautical miles wide. The shape of the award has been likened to a keyhole, a mushroom, and a baguette.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|title=Oh, (No) Canada! |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/oh-no-canada/ |work=Opinionator: Borderlines|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=July 15, 2012|author=Frank Jacobs|date=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award was approximately 18% of the territory that France had initially been claiming.

==Criticism==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
Since the 1992 award, the decision has been criticised by both Canadian and French commentators as well as neutral observers. Some have noted that a straightforward application of the [[Convention on the Law of the Sea]] would extend Canada's EEZ beyond the limits of the French corridor, meaning that the French EEZ may be entirely enveloped within Canada's EEZ, a circumstance that was not intended by the arbitral tribunal.

[[Image:Conscientious Objector memorial, Tavistock Sq Gardens.jpg|thumb|350px|Conscientious Objectors Commemorative Stone inscription]]

The '''Conscientious Objectors' Commemorative Stone''' is on the north side of [[Tavistock Square]], [[Bloomsbury]], in the [[London Borough of Camden]].

In 1994 a stone commemorating "men and women [[conscientious objector]]s all over the world and in every age" by Hugh Court&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ppu.org.uk/memorials/peace/london/costone.html&lt;/ref&gt; was unveiled in Tavistock Square.

==Erection==
The erection of this massive slate stone to commemorate the struggle of conscientious objectors past and present was co-ordinated by the [[Peace Pledge Union]] (PPU) and unveiled by Sir [[Michael Tippett]], President of the PPU and a former Conscientious Objector, on 15 May 1994 in Tavistock Square. 

==History==
The idea of having a stone dedicated to conscientious objectors (COs) to war began in 1976 at the funeral of a conscientious objector, Joseph Brett, who had been imprisoned in 1916.  Bill McIlroy, then Secretary of the National Secular Society (NSS), officiated, and happened to remark that perhaps one day COs would be commemorated, as armed forces personnel are, both nationally and locally in the places where they lived.

Edna Mathieson, niece of Joseph Brett, and a member of the Inner London Education Authority (sub group of the Greater London Council), approached the GLC for help, and in 1981 the GLC Labour Group accepted the idea and the Greater London Regional Labour Party agreed.  But when, after the abolition of the GLC in 1986, the London Residuary Board took over the GLC’s commitments, agreement to a physical commemoration of COs was lost. Mathieson turned to Lambeth Council, and Lambeth initiated a competition in all London art schools for a suitable piece of sculpture, to be set up next to County Hall (GLC's headquarters), situated in Lambeth. Lambeth Council then found that, because of cuts, it could not afford to sponsor the arrangements for such a monument.

Finally, Mathieson approached the PPU, who agreed to help with the whole concept, including design, location and raising finances. Camden Council (its local council) was asked for permission to erect a stone in Tavistock Square. On 15 May 1993, International Conscientious Objectors' Day, a public appeal was launched by means of a letter in ''The Guardian'', headed by Sir Michael Tippett.

Granite had been considered as material, as it is the strongest stone – symbolic of those who refused against the odds to fight.  However, when the PPU’s architectural adviser, Hugh Court, and sculptor, Paul Wehrle, went to Cumbria in search of a stone, they were so attracted to a naturally shaped piece of grey-green volcanic slate, some 400 million years old and rather larger than the size originally envisaged, they chose that.

The PPU decided upon the form of words for the stone with an addition of “Their foresight and courage give us hope”, written by a Dublin wordsmith.

==Annual act of remembrance==
In 1998 Mathieson pressed for the rest of Bill McIlroy's idea to be implemented - an annual event for the commemoration of all COs. A planning group was established at a Conway Hall meeting (in the Bertrand Russell Room) and Jess Hodgkins, a Unitarian, suggested the group be called the Right to Refuse to Kill Group (RRK). Ever since there has been an annual memorial event every year at noon on 15 May, International Conscientious Objectors' Day.

== Inscriptions ==
Around the left, top, and right edges:
{{quote|TO COMMEMORATE MEN &amp; WOMEN&lt;br /&gt;CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS TO MILITARY SERVICE&lt;br /&gt;ALL OVER THE WORLD &amp; IN EVERY AGE}}

In the centre:
{{quote|TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE&lt;br /&gt;ESTABLISHED AND&lt;br /&gt;ARE MAINTAINING&lt;br /&gt;THE RIGHT TO&lt;br /&gt;REFUSE TO KILL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their foresight and&lt;br /&gt;courage give us hope}}

Along the bottom edge:
{{quote|THIS STONE WAS DEDICATED ON 15 MAY 1994&lt;br /&gt;INTERNATIONAL CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS' DAY}}

==Nearby related public art==
Also in Tavistock Square is a statue of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], sculpted by [[Fredda Brilliant]] and installed in 1968 and a cherry tree planted in 1967 in memory of the victims of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear bombing]] of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]].

With the Conscientious Objectors Commemorative Stone, the three features have led to the square unofficially being regarded by some as a peace park or garden.  Annual ceremonies are held at each of these memorials including International [[Conscientious Objectors]] Day, 15 May.

The '''Crossbows Act 1987''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], which is still in force. The Act, as amended, controls the possession of [[crossbow]]s by people under the age of eighteen throughout the whole of the [[United Kingdom]]. It gained the [[Royal Assent]] on 15 May 1987, and came into force two months later.

==Provisions of the Act==

Section 1 of the Act made it an offence to knowingly sell or hire a crossbow (or part of a crossbow) to a person under the age of seventeen; section 2 created the converse offence of buying or hiring a crossbow whilst underage.

Section 3 made it an offence for someone under the age of seventeen to possess a functioning crossbow, or of sufficient parts to make a functioning crossbow, unless under the supervision of an adult. Section 4 gave a [[police constable]] the power to search someone or their vehicle, if they suspected an offence was being committed under section 3; to detain someone for the purpose of this search; and to confiscate any crossbow or part of a crossbow which was found.

A person guilty of an offence under section 1 was liable for up to six months imprisonment or a fine up to level five on the [[standard scale]]; a person guilty of an offence under sections 2 or 3 was liable for a fine of up to level three on the standard scale. On conviction, the court could order any crossbow or components involved to be forfeited or destroyed.

The Act explicitly does not apply to crossbows with a [[draw weight]] of less than {{convert|1.4|kg|abbr=on}}.

==Amendments==

Section 44 of the [[Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006]] amended the Act, raising the minimum age for possession from seventeen to eighteen; in Scotland, the same change was implemented by Section 62 of the [[Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Act 2007]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4933">'''Data theft''' is a growing phenomenon primarily caused by [[system administrators]] and office workers with access to technology such as [[database servers]], [[desktop computer]]s and a growing list of hand-held devices capable of storing digital information, such as [[USB flash drive]]s, [[iPod]]s and even [[digital camera]]s. Since employees often spend a considerable amount of time developing contacts and [[confidential]] and [[copyright]]ed information for the company they work for, they may feel they have some right to the information and are inclined to copy and/or delete part of it when they leave the company, or misuse it while they are still in employment. They can be sold and bought and then used by criminals and criminal organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xing|first1=Liudong|last2=Levitin|first2=Gregory|title=Balancing theft and corruption threats by data partition in cloud system with independent server protection|journal=Reliability Engineering &amp; System Safety|date=November 2017|volume=167|pages=248–254|doi=10.1016/j.ress.2017.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Alternatively, an employee may choose to deliberately abuse trusted access to information for the purpose of exposing [[misconduct]] by the employer; From the perspective of the society such an act of [[Whistleblower|whistleblowing]] can be seen as positive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= 
https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/06/government_secr.html |title= Government Secrets and the Need for Whistle-blowers |work= Schneier on Security |first= Bruce |last= Schneier |authorlink= Bruce Schneier |date= 10 June 2013 |accessdate= 15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is in certain situations protected by law in some jurisdictions, such as the [[Whistleblower protection in the United States|USA]].

A common scenario is where a sales person makes a copy of the contact [[database]] for use in their next job. Typically, this is a clear violation of their terms of employment.

Notable acts of data theft include those by leaker [[Chelsea Manning]] and self-proclaimed whistleblowers [[Edward Snowden]] and [[Hervé Falciani]].

==Data theft methods==

The phrase ''data theft'' is actually a misnomer, since unlike [[theft]] the typical data theft methods typically do not deprive the owner of their data, but rather create an additional, unauthorized copy.

===Thumbsucking===
Thumbsucking, similar to podslurping, is the intentional or undeliberate use of a portable [[USB mass storage device class|USB mass storage device]], such as a [[USB flash drive]] (or "thumbdrive"), to illicitly download confidential data from a network endpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thumbsuckingthreat.com/index.html |title=Do you know who is sucking data from your computer? |accessdate=15 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819080552/http://www.thumbsuckingthreat.com/index.html |archivedate=August 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A USB flash drive was allegedly used to remove without authorization highly classified documents about the design of U.S. nuclear weapons from a vault at Los Alamos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rawstory.com/showoutarticle.php?src=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.time.com%2Ftime%2Fprintout%2F0%2C8816%2C1612912%2C00.html Zagorin, Adam "A breach in nuclear security."] Time, April 19, 2007. Retrieved April 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The threat of thumbsucking has been amplified for a number of reasons, including the following:
*The storage capacity of portable USB storage devices has increased.
*The cost of high-capacity portable USB storage devices has decreased.
*Networks have grown more dispersed, the number of remote network access points has increased and methods of network connection have expanded, increasing the number of vectors for network infiltration.

==Investigating data theft==
Techniques to investigate data theft include [[stochastic forensics]], [[digital artifact]] analysis (especially of [[USB flash drive|USB drive]] artifacts), and other [[computer forensics]] techniques.

== Terminology ==
In some countries this term is incorrect because it is considered that theft is of a thing (material object) and [[information]] is not a thing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoleg.gov.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/105000-109999/109481/texactley340_libroIII_tituloI.htm Código civil Argentino art. 2311]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoleg.gov.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/15000-19999/16546/texact.htm Código penal Argentino art. 164]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3222">'''Eco-Cement''' is a [[brand|brand-name]] for a type of [[cement]] which incorporates reactive [[magnesium oxide|magnesia]] (sometimes called caustic calcined magnesia or magnesium oxide, MgO), another hydraulic cement such as [[Portland cement]], and optionally pozzolans and industrial by-products, to reduce the environmental impact relative to conventional cement. One problem with the commercialization of this cement, other than the conservatism of the building industry, is that the feedstock [[magnesite]] is rarely mined.

== Energy requirements ==
Ordinary Portland cement requires a kiln temperature of around 1450&amp;nbsp;°C. The reactive magnesia in Eco-Cement requires a lower kiln temperature of 750&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, P: "Architecture in a Climate of Change", page 206. Elsevier, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7506-6544-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which lowers the energy requirements, and hence the use of fossil fuels and emission of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

== CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sequestration ==
Eco-Cement sets and hardens by [[Carbon dioxide sink|sequestering]] CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere and is recyclable. The rate of absorption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; varies with the degree of porosity and the amount of MgO. Carbonation occurs quickly at first and more slowly towards completion. A typical Eco-Cement concrete block would be expected to fully carbonate within a year.

== Waste utilization ==
Eco-Cement is able to incorporate a greater number of industrial waste products as aggregate than Portland cement as it is less [[alkaline]]. This reduces the incidence of [[alkali-aggregate reaction]]s which cause damage to hardened concrete.&lt;ref&gt;Swamy, R: "The Alkali-silica Reaction in Concrete", page 46. Taylor &amp; Francis, 1992, {{ISBN|0-216-92691-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eco-Cement also has the ability to be almost fully recycled back into cement, should a concrete structure become obsolete.

'''Energy recovery ventilation''' ('''ERV''') is the [[energy recovery]] process of exchanging the energy contained in normally exhausted building or space air and using it to treat (precondition) the incoming outdoor [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] air in residential and commercial [[HVAC]] systems.  During the warmer seasons, the system pre-cools and dehumidifies while humidifying and pre-heating in the cooler seasons.&lt;ref name="Dieckmann1"&gt;Dieckmann, John. "Improving Humidity Control with Energy Recovery Ventilation." ''ASHRAE Journal''. 50, no. 8, (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  The benefit of using energy recovery is the ability to meet the [[ASHRAE]] ventilation &amp; energy standards, while improving [[indoor air quality]] and reducing total HVAC equipment capacity.

This technology has not only demonstrated an effective means of reducing energy cost and heating and cooling loads, but has allowed for the scaling down of equipment.  Additionally, this system will allow for the indoor environment to maintain a relative humidity of 40% to 50%.  This range can be maintained under essentially all conditions.  The only energy penalty is the power needed for the blower to overcome the pressure drop in the system.&lt;ref name="Dieckmann1" /&gt;

== Importance ==
Nearly half of global energy is used in buildings,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interacademycouncil.net/CMS/Reports/11840/11914/11920.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and half of heating/cooling cost is caused by ventilation when it is done by the "open window" method according to the regulations [define method and include citation]. Secondly, energy generation and grid is made to meet the peak demand of power. To use proper ventilation; recovery is a cost-efficient, sustainable and quick way to reduce global energy consumption and give better [[indoor air quality]] (IAQ) and protect buildings, and environment.

== Methods of transfer ==
An energy recovery ventilator (also abbreviated ERV) is a type of air-to-air heat exchanger that not only transfers [[sensible heat]] but also [[latent heat]]. Because both temperature and moisture are transferred, ERVs can be considered total enthalpic devices.  On the other hand, a [[Heat recovery ventilation|heat recovery ventilator]] (HRV) can only transfer sensible heat. HRVs can be considered ''sensible only'' devices because they only exchange sensible heat.  In other words, whereas all ERVs are HRVs, not all HRVs are ERVs, but many people use the terms HRV, AAHX ([[air-to-air heat exchanger]]), and ERV interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;The Healthy House Institute. Staff. "ERV". [http://www.healthyhouseinstitute.com/hhip_493-ERV Understanding Ventilation: How to Design, Select, and Install Residential Ventilation Systems.] June 4, 2009. December 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the cooling season, the system works to cool and dehumidify the incoming, outside air.  This is accomplished by the system taking the rejected heat and sending it into the exhaust airstream.  Subsequently, this air cools the condenser coil at a lower temperature than if the rejected heat had not entered the exhaust airstream.  During the heating seasons, the system works in reverse.  Instead of discharging the heat into the exhaust airstream, the system draws heat from the exhaust airstream in order to pre-heat the incoming air.  At this stage, the air passes through a primary unit and then into a space.  With this type of system, it is normal, during the cooling seasons, for the exhaust air to be cooler than the ventilation air and, during the heating seasons, warmer than the ventilation air.  It is for this reason the system works very efficiently and effectively. The [[coefficient of performance|coefficient of performance (COP)]] will increase as the conditions become more extreme (i.e., more hot and humid for cooling and colder for heating).&lt;ref&gt;Braun, James E, Kevin B Mercer. "Symposium Papers - OR-05-11 - Energy Recovery Ventilation: Energy, Humidity, and Economic Implications - Evaluation of a Ventilation Heat Pump for Small Commercial Buildings." ASHRAE Transactions. 111, no. 1, (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efficiency ==
The efficiency of an ERV system is the ratio of energy transferred between the two air streams compared with the total energy transported through the heat exchanger.&lt;ref name="Pulsifer1"&gt;Pulsifer, J. E., A. R. Raffray, and M. S. Tillack. "Improved Performance of Energy Recovery Ventilators Using Advanced Porous Heat Transfer Media." UCSD-ENG-089. December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="christiansenbook"&gt;Christensen, Bill. [http://www.p2pays.org/ref/20/sourcebook/www.greenbuilder.com/sourcebook/EnergyRecoveryVent.html#EFFICIENCY “Sustainable Building Sourcebook.” City of Austin’s Green Building Program. Guidelines 3.0. 1994.]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the variety of products on the market, efficiency will vary as well.  Some of these systems have been known to have heat exchange efficiencies as high as 70-80% while others have as low as 50%.  Even though this lower figure is preferable to the basic HVAC system, it is not up to par with the rest of its class.  Studies are being done to increase the heat transfer efficiency to 90%.&lt;ref name="Pulsifer1" /&gt;

The use of modern low-cost gas-phase heat exchanger technology will allow for significant improvements in efficiency.  The use of high conductivity porous material is believed to produce an exchange effectiveness in excess of 90%.  By exceeding a 90% effective rate, an improvement of up to five factors in energy loss can be seen.&lt;ref name="Pulsifer1" /&gt;

The Home Ventilation Institute (HVI) has developed a standard test for any and all units manufactured within the United States.  Regardless, not all have been tested.  It is imperative to investigate efficiency claims, comparing data produced by HVI as well as that produced by the manufacturer. (Note: all units sold in Canada are placed through the [[R-2000 program]], a standard test synonymous to the HVI test).&lt;ref name="christiansenbook" /&gt;

== Rotary air-to-air enthalpy wheel ==
{{main|Thermal wheel}}
The rotating wheel heat exchanger is composed of a rotating cylinder filled with an air permeable material resulting in a large surface area. The surface area is the medium for the sensible energy transfer. As the wheel rotates between the ventilation and exhaust air streams it picks up heat energy and releases it into the colder air stream. The driving force behind the exchange is the difference in temperatures between the opposing air streams which is also called the thermal gradient. Typical media used consists of polymer, aluminum, and synthetic fiber.

The enthalpy exchange is accomplished through the use of [[desiccant]]s.  Desiccants transfer moisture through the process of [[adsorption]] which is predominately driven by the difference in the [[partial pressure]] of vapor within the opposing air-streams.  Typical desiccants consist of [[silica gel]], and [[molecular sieve]]s.

Enthalpy wheels are the most effective devices to transfer both latent and sensible energy but there are many different types of construction that dictate the wheel's durability.  The most common materials used in the construction of the rotor are Polymer, Aluminum and Fiberglass.

When using rotary energy recovery devices the two air streams must be adjacent to one another to allow for the local transfer of energy.  Also, there should be special considerations paid in colder climates to avoid wheel frosting. Systems can avoid frosting by modulating wheel speed, preheating the air, or stop/jogging the system.

== Plate heat exchanger ==
{{main|Recuperator}}
Fixed plate heat exchangers have no moving parts, and consist of alternating layers of plates that are separated and sealed. Typical flow is cross current and since the majority of plates are solid and non permeable, sensible only transfer is the result.

The tempering of incoming fresh air is done by a heat or energy recovery core.  In this case, the core is made of aluminum or plastic plates.  Humidity levels are adjusted through the transferring of water vapor.  This is done with a rotating wheel either containing a [[desiccant]] material or permeable plates.&lt;ref&gt;Huelman, Pat, Wanda Olson. [http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/housingandclothing/dk7284.html Common Questions about Heating and Energy Recovery Ventilators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230120234/http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/housingandclothing/DK7284.html |date=2010-12-30 }} University of Minnesota Extension. 1999. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enthalpy plates were introduced 2006 by Paul, a special company for ventilation systems for [[passive house]]s. A crosscurrent countercurrent air-to-air heat exchanger built with a humidity permeable material.  Polymer fixed-plate countercurrent energy recovery ventilators were introduced in 1998 by Building Performance Equipment (BPE), a residential, commercial, and industrial air-to-air energy recovery manufacturer.  These heat exchangers can be both introduced as a retrofit for increased energy savings and fresh air as well as an alternative to new construction.  In new construction situations, energy recovery will effectively reduce the required heating/cooling capacity of the system.  The percentage of the total energy saved will depend on the efficiency of the device (up to 90% sensible) and the latitude of the building.

Due to the need to use multiple sections, fixed plate energy exchangers are often associated with high pressure drop and larger footprints.  Due to their inability to offer a high amount of latent energy transfer these systems also have a high chance for frosting in colder climates.

The technology patented by Finnish company RecyclingEnergy Int. Corp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recyclingenergy.com Recycling Energy]&lt;/ref&gt; is based on a regenerative plate heat exchanger taking advantage of humidity of air by cyclical condensation and evaporation, e.g. latent heat, enabling not only high annual thermal efficiency but also microbe-free plates due to self-cleaning/washing method. Therefore the unit is called an enthalpy recovery ventilator rather than heat or energy recovery ventilator.  Company´s patented LatentHeatPump is based on its enthalpy recovery ventilator having COP of 33 in the summer and 15 in the winter.

In American politics, '''fusionism''' is the philosophical and political combination or "fusion" of [[Traditionalist conservatism in the United States|traditionalist]] and [[Social conservatism in the United States|social conservatism]] with political and economic [[right-libertarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;E.J. Dionne, Jr., ''Why Americans Hate Politics'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1991, 161&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy is most closely associated with [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank S. Meyer, ''In Defense of Freedom and Other Essays'', Indianapolis, Liberty Fund, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual founding and positions==
The philosophy of "fusionism" was developed at ''[[National Review]]'' magazine during the 1950s under the editorship of William F. Buckley, Jr. and is most identified with his associate editor [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]]. As Buckley recounted the founding he "brokered" between "an extraordinary mix" of libertarians, traditional conservatives, anti-communists and even an anarchist to produce the ideas and writings that produced modern conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rago. "Interview: William F. Buckley, Jr." ''The Wall Street Journal'', November 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He identified Meyer's synthesis as the most likely best solution of defining conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;William F. Buckley, Jr. ''Did You Ever See a Dream Walking: American Conservative Thought in the 20th Century'' (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merriall Books, 1970), p. xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his most influential book, ''In Defense of Freedom'', Meyer defined freedom in what [[Isaiah Berlin]] would label "negative" terms as the minimization of the use of coercion by the state in its essential role of preventing one person's freedom from intruding upon another's. The state should protect freedom but otherwise leave virtue to individuals. The state has only three legitimate functions – police, military and operating a legal system, all necessary to control coercion, which is immoral if not restricted. Virtue is critical for society and freedom must be balanced by responsibility but both are inherently individual in form. Coerced values cannot be virtuous. Freedom by itself has no goal, no intrinsic end. Freedom is not abstract or utopian as with the utilitarians, who also make freedom an end rather than a means. In a real society traditional order and freedom can only exist together.  The solution is a philosophical synthesis of both freedom and tradition, the solution to the dilemma is "grasping it by both horns" and accepting the tension between the two.&lt;ref&gt;''In Defense of Freedom'', pp. 74–121&lt;/ref&gt;

Fusionism's most famous advocate was Ronald Reagan as an early admirer of National Review and associate of both editors. On assuming the presidency in 1981, he met with conservative leaders around the country in Washington and reminded them of their intellectual roots. After listing "intellectual leaders like Russell Kirk, Friedrich Hayek, Henry Hazlitt, Milton Friedman, James Burnham, [and] Ludwig von Mises" as the ones who "shaped so much of our thoughts," he discussed only one of these influences at length:

{{quote|It's especially hard to believe that it was only a decade ago, on a cold April day on a small hill in upstate New York, that another of these great thinkers, Frank Meyer, was buried. He'd made the awful journey that so many others had: he pulled himself from the clutches of 'The [communist] God That Failed,' and then in his writing fashioned a vigorous new synthesis of traditional and libertarian thought – a synthesis that is today recognized by many as modern conservatism.}}

As he recalled him, the new president outlined the ideas Meyer synthesized as the principles for this new conservative movement.

{{quote|It was Frank Meyer who reminded us that the robust individualism of the American experience was part of the deeper current of Western learning and culture. He pointed out that a respect for law, an appreciation for tradition, and regard for the social consensus that gives stability to our public and private institutions, these civilized ideas must still motivate us even as we seek a new economic prosperity based on reducing government interference in the marketplace. Our goals complement each other. We're not cutting the budget simply for the sake of sounder financial management. This is only a first step toward returning power to the states and communities, only a first step toward reordering the relationship between citizen and government.

We can make government again responsive to the people by cutting its size and scope and thereby ensuring that its legitimate functions are performed efficiently and justly. Because ours is a consistent philosophy of government,  we can be very clear: We do not have a separate social agenda, separate economic agenda, and a separate foreign agenda. We have one agenda. Just as surely as we seek to put our financial house in order and rebuild our nation's defenses, so too we seek to protect the unborn, to end the manipulation of schoolchildren by utopian planners, and permit the acknowledgement of a Supreme Being in our classrooms just as we allow such acknowledgements in other public institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Reagan, "Address to the Conservative Political Action Conference," March 20, 1981, {{cite web |url=http://www.conservative.org/acuf/our-philosophy/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110134608/http://www.conservative.org/acuf/our-philosophy/ |archivedate=2012-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Political history==
Fusionism saw its height during the [[Reagan administration|presidency]] of [[Ronald Reagan]], who had brought together the divided factions after [[Gerald Ford]]'s loss in the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 election]]. [[Rich Lowry]] has argued that Reagan maintained a fusionist 'sweet spot' of both ideological flexibility and respect for conservative principles.&lt;ref name=boat/&gt; In the immediate aftermath of the [[Republican Revolution|Republican takeover of Congress in 1994]], fusionism was also at its height. The [[social conservatism|social conservative]] element of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was seen on the ascent (at least with respect to domestic politics) during the presidency of [[George W Bush]]. Increased spending angered traditional conservatives, [[fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservatives]], and libertarians.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/03/the_end_of_republican_fusionis.html]{{cite news |publisher=[[realclear politics]] |title=The end of republican fusionism?|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/03/the_end_of_republican_fusionis.html |date=March 1, 2008 |accessdate=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the long-standing tensions between [[neoconservatism|neoconservatives]] and [[paleoconservatism|paleoconservatives]] bubbled over in the wake of the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan said during a June 2009 [[Hudson Institute]] conference speech:

{{quote|A "libertarian" who wants limited government should embrace the means to his freedom: thriving mediating institutions that create the moral preconditions for economic markets and choice. A "social issues" conservative with a zeal for righteousness should insist on a free market economy to supply the material needs for families, schools, and churches that inspire moral and spiritual life. In a nutshell, the notion of separating the social from the economic issues is a false choice. They stem from the same root.&lt;ref name=boat&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Pajamas Media]] |title=We're Going to Need a Bigger Tent |url=http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/were-going-to-need-a-bigger-tent/ |date=June 13, 2009 |accessdate=June 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

While both these principles are traditionally conservative, the equal emphasis of traditional morality and free markets is a characteristic of fusionism.

Following the Republican Party's defeat in the [[United States House elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], some were calling for a new "fusionism" between libertarians and liberals in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to address what is seen as increasing governmental interference in private activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2006_12_03-2006_12_09.shtml#1165588046 What Is (or Was) "Fusionism"?]&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 elections]] and the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] have brought renewed tension between the  libertarians and the social conservatives with centrist economic views.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Fusionists tend to see the unpopularity of George W. Bush's Keynesian economic stimulus policies, his "compassionate conservatism," such as in his new entitlement prescription drug program, and his party's following defeat by President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, as reasons requiring a fusionist renewal if conservatism was ever to regain the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald J. Devine]], ''America's Way Back: Reconciling Freedom, Tradition and Constitution'' (Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, 2013); Brandon James Smith, "Time for a Return to Fusionism," Public Discourse, February 19, 2014, http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2014/02/11937/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In a polemic, the [[Traditionalist conservatism in the United States|traditional]] conservative philosopher [[Russell Kirk]], quoting [[T. S. Eliot]]'s expression called libertarians ''"chirping sectaries"''. Adding that although conservatives and libertarians share opposition to collectivism, the totalist state and bureaucracy, have otherwise nothing in common. He called the libertarian movement "an ideological clique forever splitting into sects still smaller and odder, but rarely conjugating." Stating that a line of division exists between believers in "some sort of transcendent moral order" and "utilitarians admitting no transcendent sanctions for conduct." He included libertarians in the latter category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirk|first=Russell|title=Libertarians: the Chirping Sectaries|url=http://www.mmisi.org/ma/25_04/kirk.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902193037/http://www.mmisi.org/ma/25_04/kirk.pdf|dead-url=no|archive-date=2009-09-02|work=Modern Age|publisher=Intercollegiate Studies Institute|location=Wilmington, DE|pages=345–51|date=Fall 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk had questioned fusionism between libertarians and traditional conservatives that marked much of post-World War II conservatism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/posts/1165701072.shtml|title=The Volokh Conspiracy – Russell Kirk, Libertarianism, and Fusionism:|work=volokh.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industries served include OEMs, power, oil and gas, manufacturing, military and aerospace, mining and metals, telecommunications, and water and wastewater industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = GE Automation &amp; Controls {{!}} Automation World|url = http://www.automationworld.com/company/ge-automation-controls|website = www.automationworld.com|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1986, GE Fanuc Automation Corporation was jointly established in the US by [[FANUC]] and [[General Electric]] (GE). Under the joint venture company, three operating companies, GE Fanuc Automation North America, Inc., in the U.S., GE Fanuc Automation Europe S.A. in Luxembourg, and Fanuc GE Automation Asia Ltd. in Japan were established (the Asian company was established in 1987).

In 2007, the company was renamed to GE Fanuc Intelligent Platforms (and GE Fanuc Automation Solutions Europe SA became GE Fanuc Intelligent Platforms Europe SA). GE Fanuc Automation CNC Europe changed its name to Fanuc GE CNC Europe.

In 2009, GE and Fanuc agreed to dissolve joint venture and the software, controls and embedded business became part of GE, under the new name GE Intelligent Platforms.

In 2015, GE Intelligent Platforms, Inc. changed its name to Automation &amp; Controls upon acquisition of [[Alstom]]'s Power Automation &amp; Controls business.

In 2018, amidst ambitious restructuration plans for the whole General Electric group, it was announced that [[Emerson Electric]] was to acquire Intelligent Platforms&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nasdaq.com/article/emerson-to-acquire-intelligent-platforms-general-electric-unit--quick-facts-20181002-00305&lt;/ref&gt;, with the deal being effective in the first half of the following year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23687">The '''General Mobile Radio Service''' (GMRS) is a land-mobile [[frequency modulation|FM]] [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[radio]] service designed for short-distance two-way communication. It requires a license in [[United States]] but some GMRS compatible equipment can be used license-free in [[Canada]]. The United States permits use by adult individuals who possesses a valid GMRS license, as well as their immediate family members.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The FCC definition of “immediate family” includes the licensee’s spouse, children, stepchildren, parents, stepparents, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, and in-laws. See 47&amp;nbsp;[[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]]&amp;nbsp;95.179&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediate relatives of the GMRS system licensee are entitled to communicate among themselves for personal or business purposes, but employees of the licensee who are not family members are not covered by the license &amp;nbsp; non-family members must be licensed separately.

GMRS radios are typically handheld portable devices much like [[Family Radio Service]] (FRS) radios, and share the FRS frequency band near 462 and 467&amp;nbsp;MHz.  Mobile and base station-style radios are available as well, but these are normally commercial UHF radios as often used in the public service and commercial land mobile bands.  These are legal for use in this service as long as they are GMRS type-approved.

==Licensing==
Any individual in the United States who is at least 18&amp;nbsp;years of age and not a representative of a foreign government may apply for a GMRS license by completing the application form, either on paper or online through the FCC's Universal Licensing System.  No exam is required. A GMRS license is issued for a 10&amp;nbsp;year term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC |title=GMRS Information |url=https://www.fcc.gov/general-mobile-radio-service-gmrs}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fee is $70 for most applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC |title=GMRS fee schedule |url=http://wireless.fcc.gov/feesforms/feeguide/services/generalmobile.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A GMRS individual license extends to immediate family members and authorizes them to use the licensed system.&lt;ref name="family"&gt;{{cite web |title=Title&amp;nbsp;47 → Chapter&amp;nbsp;I → Subchapter&amp;nbsp;D → Part&amp;nbsp;95 → Subpart&amp;nbsp;A → §95.179 |url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7f586db1d0579e3dbf18c41914a8fe14&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se47.5.95_1179&amp;rgn=div8 |website=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; GMRS license holders are allowed to communicate with FRS users on those frequencies that are shared between the two services. GMRS individual licenses do not extend to employees.&lt;ref name="family" /&gt;

New GMRS licenses are being issued only to individuals. Prior to 31&amp;nbsp;July 1987, the FCC issued GMRS licenses to non-individuals (corporations, partnerships, government entities, etc.). These licensees are [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] and may renew but not make major modifications to their existing licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wireless.fcc.gov/services/index.htm?job=licensing_1&amp;id=general_mobile |publisher=FCC |series=Wireless Services: General Mobile Radio Service |title=Licensing: Eligibility}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, each GMRS station must be identified by transmission of its FCC-assigned call sign at the end of a transmission or a series of transmissions, and at least once every 15&amp;nbsp;minutes for a series lasting more than 15&amp;nbsp;minutes. The call sign may be spoken or sent with audible tones using Morse code. A repeater station handling properly identified transmissions of others is not required to send its own station identification (47&amp;nbsp;CFR&amp;nbsp;§95.1751).

==Range==
As with other UHF radio services, reliable range is considered to be [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] and the distance to the [[Line-of-sight propagation#Radio horizon|radio horizon]] can be estimated based on antenna height. Theoretically, the range between two hand-held units would be about one or two miles (about 1.5–3&amp;nbsp;km); mobile units have higher antennas and a range of around 5 miles (8&amp;nbsp;km). A GMRS [[repeater]] with an antenna that is high above the surrounding terrain can extend the usable range over a wide area – for example, up to a 20&amp;nbsp;mile (32.2&amp;nbsp;km) radius around the repeater station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=H. Ward |last=Silver |title=Two-way radios &amp; scanners for dummies |publisher=For Dummies |year=2005 |ISBN=0-7645-9582-2 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obstructions such as hills and buildings can reduce range. Higher power does not necessarily give a proportional increase in range, although it may improve the reliability of communication at the limits of line-of-sight distance.

== Frequency assignments and FRS ==
The GMRS-only channels are defined in pairs, with one frequency in the 462&amp;nbsp;MHz range for [[Simplex communication|simplex]] and [[repeater]] outputs, and another in the 467&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency range for repeater inputs. There are eight channels exclusively for GMRS and seven "interstitial" channels shared with Family Radio Service. GMRS use requires an FCC license, and licensees are permitted to transmit at up to 50  [[watt]]s on GMRS frequencies, depending on the type of station,&lt;ref name="95.135"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=47:5.0.1.1.5&amp;idno=47#47:5.0.1.1.5.1.139.21 |title=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations, Title&amp;nbsp;47 |at=§95.135 |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108214031/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=33d962284348d5bf6c78f7cc44b19e66&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=47%3A5.0.1.1.5&amp;idno=47#47:5.0.1.1.5.1.139.21 |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but 1 to 5&amp;nbsp;Watts is more common. Units are allowed to have detachable or external antennas.

GMRS licensees are also able to use the first seven of the FRS frequencies (the "interstitial" GMRS frequencies) with a few limitations. Specifically, they may be used as long as one-way pages are not transmitted, communications are limited to voice, and transmission power ([[Effective radiated power|ERP]]) does not exceed 5&amp;nbsp;Watts (FCC Code §95.29, section&amp;nbsp;f). This allows GMRS users to transmit on a total of 15&amp;nbsp;channels. FRS channels 8 through 14 are not available for GMRS use; use of these frequencies requires an FRS transceiver, or a hybrid transceiver operating under FRS rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5447912ed1c106cb636130d863edb44e&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=47:5.0.1.1.5&amp;idno=47 |title=ECFR |website=GPOAccess.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[http://www.fcc.gov/ Federal Communications Commission] |work=Code of Federal Regulations, Title&amp;nbsp;47 |series=Telecommunication Chapter&amp;nbsp;1 — Federal Communications Commission, Part&amp;nbsp;95 |title=Personal Radio Services |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |at=§95.29; §95.603(a); §95.603(d); §95.621; §95.627 |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2009-title47-vol5/pdf/CFR-2009-title47-vol5-part95.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrid FRS/GMRS consumer radios have been introduced with 22&amp;nbsp;channels, instead of the 14&amp;nbsp;channels associated with FRS. On this type of radio, transmitting on shared FRS/GMRS channels&amp;nbsp;1–7 requires a license if using more than 0.5&amp;nbsp;Watt. Channels&amp;nbsp;8–14 are strictly license-free FRS channels. Transmitting on GMRS-only channels&amp;nbsp;15–22 requires a license. It is the responsibility of the radio user to read and understand all applicable rules and regulations regarding GMRS. These hybrid radios are often referred to as "bubble pack" radios, since they are often packed in a plastic shell, for hanging on a display shelf.  The massive sales of these radios have led to the term "bubble-pack [[Pirate radio|pirates]]", persons who use GMRS without a license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Cantor, Andrew |newspaper=USAToday.com |title=CyberSpeak - Walkie-talkies still fit in the dreams of little boys |publisher=USA Today division of Gannett Co. Inc. |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2011-03-11 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/andrewkantor/2005-01-07-kantor_x.htm |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective 28&amp;nbsp;September 2017, FCC revised the definition of the FRS service. FRS operation is now permitted with up to 2&amp;nbsp;Watts on the shared FRS / GMRS channels. The FCC will not grant type acceptance for hybrid radios that would exceed the limits for the FRS  service on the FRS channels. Current "hybrid" FRS/GMRS radios will not require a GMRS license for power up to 2&amp;nbsp;Watts, but FRS radios will still not be permitted to use the input frequencies of GMRS repeaters. Any radio exceeding the limits of the new FRS service will be classified as a GMRS radio.&lt;ref name=FCC-GMRS-FRS-Reform-2017&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db0522/FCC-17-57A1.pdf |title=FCC Part 95 Personal Radio Services Rules Reform |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |accessdate=May 19, 2017 |quote=Paragraphs&amp;nbsp;51 and 52 list the changes on the FRS / GMRS channels and power restrictions. These modifications are meant to affect previous FRS / GMRS hybrid radios in the United State that were commonly sold to redefine them as FRS radios, since many users that purchase these radios did not know the FCC license requirements. As a result, these users will not require a GMRS license. Radios transmitting higher than the new FRS power restrictions are re-defined as GMRS radios and users will require a GMRS license to use these devices. The changes (channels and power limitations) went into effect on 28&amp;nbsp;September 2017. |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCC rules for use of hybrid radios on channels 1–7&amp;nbsp;require licensing only when operating under the rules that apply to the GMRS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wireless.fcc.gov/services/index.htm?job=service_home&amp;id=general_mobile |title=General Mobile Radio Service |access-date=2011-01-31 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many hybrid radios have an ERP that is lower than a half-watt on channels&amp;nbsp;1–7, or can be set by the user to operate at low power on these channels. This allows hybrid radios to be used under the license-free FRS rules if the ERP is less than one half watt and the unit is certified for FRS operation. Only two makers of hybrid FRS / GMRS radios (Garmin and Motorola) presently sell radios that will operate on the GMRS repeater channels; the common "22&amp;nbsp;channel" radios cannot be used with GMRS repeaters. The Icom IC-F21GM is a solely-GMRS radio that will also work with repeaters. FRS rules permit only 2.5&amp;nbsp;kHz ([[Narrowband FM]]) [[frequency deviation]] on the FRS shared channels. GMRS uses ±5&amp;nbsp;kHz [[Frequency Modulation#deviation|deviation]] on the GMRS channels.

Effective 30&amp;nbsp;September 2019, it becomes unlawful in the USA to import, manufacture, sell, or offer to sell radio equipment capable of operating under both GMRS and FRS.&lt;ref name=PRS_reform_2018Aug29&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/08/29/2017-17395/personal-radio-service-reform |title=47 CFR § 95.1792 |series=Personal Radio Service reform |date=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frequency chart==
In the table below, the so-called "''Friendly Name''" of a frequency is the portion of the frequency to the right of the decimal (the kHz portion). For example: the "friendly name" for 462.550&amp;nbsp;MHz is "550".

This first set of frequencies shows the split frequency pairs used in duplex operational mode, often used with repeaters. [[Simplex communication|Simplex]] (same frequency for receiving and transmitting) mode only utilizes the lower set of frequencies.

GMRS radio channels in the table below use 5&amp;nbsp;kHz deviation and 25&amp;nbsp;kHz channel bandwidth although some "bubble pack" combo FRS/GMRS radios utilize 2.5&amp;nbsp;kHz deviation. For best compatibility of audio level, 5&amp;nbsp;kHz deviation should be used when communicating with GMRS equipment. The 4-digit decimal GMRS frequencies (shared FRS&amp;nbsp;1-7 / ICOM&amp;nbsp;9-15) are spaced 12.5&amp;nbsp;kHz from the (ICOM 1-8) GMRS frequencies, and may receive interference from other nearby stations. It may be advisable to use 12.5&amp;nbsp;kHz narrow-band (NFM) in congested areas, or avoid their use as a last resort.

==History==
The predecessor to GMRS was named '''Class&amp;nbsp;A Citizens Radio Service''' when it was rolled out in the 1960s. Tube type transceivers were used, and transmitter power was limited to 60 watts (plate input power to the final amplifier tube). The original service ran wideband FM with ±15&amp;nbsp;kHz transmitter deviation and 50&amp;nbsp;kHz channel spacing. At the time, this was the norm for all U.S. land mobile services. There was also a Class&amp;nbsp;B Citizens Radio Service which used a different set of 461&amp;nbsp;MHz channels and was limited to 5&amp;nbsp;Watts output. Business users were permitted to license in this radio service. Radios were built by consumer electronics firms and commercial two-way radio vendors.

In the 1960s, the UHF 450–470&amp;nbsp;MHz band was re-allocated to 25&amp;nbsp;kHz channels. This meant transmitter deviation was reduced to ±5&amp;nbsp;kHz. This doubled the number of channels available across the entire 450–470&amp;nbsp;MHz band. Class&amp;nbsp;B Citizens Radio Service channels were re-allocated to other radio services.

In the 1970s, allowed power was again changed to 50&amp;nbsp;Watts across the output terminals of the transmitter. In 1987, licensing of business users was discontinued and businesses were allowed to continue operating until their licenses expired. There was congestion on all channels in larger [[metropolitan statistical area]]s and moving businesses to [[Business band|Business Radio Service]] channels would provide some relief. The radio service was changed to its present name; General Mobile Radio Service or GMRS.

In 2010 the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) proposed removing the individual licensing requirement. In 2015, the FCC ruled to keep the license requirement, but to remove the regulator fee for licensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0521/FCC-15-59A1.pdf |title=FCC-15-59A1 |series=Daily Releases |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopted on 20&amp;nbsp;May 2015, the ruling would be in effect after a 90&amp;nbsp;day notification period to Congress; the fee will not be eliminated before 18&amp;nbsp;August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0521/FCC-15-59A1.pdf |title=FCC-15-59A1 |format=pdf |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fee for a 5&amp;nbsp;year license was $90.00, with the regulatory fee portion of the license at $5&amp;nbsp;per year (or $25 for the 5&amp;nbsp;year life of the license). After the notification period, the fee for a 5&amp;nbsp;year license was to become $65.00&amp;nbsp;. The change became effective on 3&amp;nbsp;September 2015.

==Use of GMRS equipment in other countries==
The use of radio transmitters is regulated by national laws and international agreements. Often radio equipment accepted for use in one part of the world may not be operated in other parts due to conflicts with frequency assignments and technical standards. Some of the roles that the licensed GMRS service fills in the United States are, in other countries, filled by unlicensed or class-licensed services. Generally these services have strict technical standards for equipment to prevent interference with licensed transmitters and systems.

In [[Canada]], hand-held GMRS radios up to 2&amp;nbsp;Watts have been approved for use without a license since September&amp;nbsp;2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Industry Canada |id=RSS 210 |title=Low-Power Licence Exempt Radiocommunications Devices}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--NB spelling of "licence" as per original --&gt; Typically these are dual FRS and GMRS units, with fixed antennas, and operating at 2&amp;nbsp;Watts on some GMRS channels and 0.5&amp;nbsp;Watt on the FRS-only channels. Mobile units (permanently mounted in vehicles), [[base station]]s and [[Radio repeater|repeater]]s are not currently permitted on the GMRS channels in Canada.

Other countries have licensed and unlicensed personal radio services with somewhat similar characteristics, but technical details and operating conditions vary according to national rules. Many European countries use a similar 8&amp;nbsp;channel system near 446&amp;nbsp;MHz known as [[PMR446]], as well as a 69&amp;nbsp;channel low-power [[LPD433]] which is shared with the [[ISM band]]. GMRS equipment that is approved for use in the United States will not communicate with PMR446 radios due to using different frequency ranges.

'''Google Drive''' is a [[File hosting service|file storage]] and [[File synchronization|synchronization service]] developed by [[Google]]. Launched on April 24, 2012, Google Drive allows users to store files on their servers, synchronize files across devices, and [[file sharing|share files]]. In addition to a [[web application|website]], Google Drive offers apps with offline capabilities for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS]] computers, and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] smartphones and tablets. Google Drive encompasses [[Google Docs, Sheets and Slides]], an [[office suite]] that permits collaborative editing of documents, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings, forms, and more. Files created and edited through the office suite are saved in Google Drive.

Google Drive offers users with 15&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte]]s of free storage though [[Google One]]. Google One also offers 100&amp;nbsp;gigabytes, 200 gigabytes, 2&amp;nbsp;[[Terabyte|terabytes]] 10&amp;nbsp;terabytes, 20&amp;nbsp;terabytes, and 30&amp;nbsp;terabytes offered through optional paid plans. Files uploaded can be up to 5&amp;nbsp;terabytes in size. Users can change privacy settings for individual files and folders, including enabling sharing with other users or making content public. On the website, users can search for an image by describing its visuals, and use [[natural language processing|natural language]] to find specific files, such as "find my budget spreadsheet from last December".

The website and Android app offer a Backups section to see what Android devices have data backed up to the service, and a completely overhauled computer app released in July 2017 allows for backing up specific folders on the user's computer. A Quick Access feature can [[Machine learning|intelligently predict]] the files users need.

Google Drive is a key component of [[G Suite]], Google's monthly subscription offering for businesses and organizations. As part of select G Suite plans, Drive offers unlimited storage, advanced file audit reporting, enhanced administration controls, and greater collaboration tools for teams.

Following the launch of the service, Google Drive privacy policy was heavily criticized by some members of the media. Google has one set of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy agreements that cover all of its services, meaning that the language in the agreements grants the company broad rights to reproduce, use, and create [[derivative work]]s from content stored on Google Drive. While the policies also confirm that users retain intellectual property rights, privacy advocates raised concerns that the licenses grant Google the rights to use the information and data to customize advertising and other services Google provides. In contrast, other members of the media noted that the agreements were no worse than those of competing cloud storage services, but that the competition uses "more artful language" in the agreements, and also stated that Google needs the rights in order to "move files around on its servers, cache your data, or make image thumbnails".

{{As of|2017|3}}, Google Drive has 800&amp;nbsp;million active users, and as of September 2015, it has over one million organizational paying users. {{As of|2017|5}}, there are over two trillion files stored on the service.

==== Backup and Sync ====
In July 2017, Google announced their new downloadable software, Backup and Sync.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.blog.google/products/photos/introducing-backup-and-sync-google-photos-and-google-drive/|title=Introducing Backup and Sync for Google Photos and Google Drive|date=2017-07-12|work=Google|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made mainly to replace the Google Drive desktop app,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3223136/data-center-cloud/google-drive-is-being-replaced-by-backup-and-sync-what-to-expect.html|title=Google Drive is being replaced by Backup and Sync: What to expect|work=PCWorld|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was discontinued.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Its main function is for the user to be able to set certain folders to constantly sync onto their [[Google Account|Google account's]] Drive. The synced folders and files count against the shared quota allocated between Gmail, Google Photos, and Google Drive.

=== Mobile apps ===
Google Drive is available for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[smartphone]]s and [[Tablet computer|tablets]] running [[Android Jelly Bean|Android 4.1 "Jelly Bean"]] or later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=System requirements and browsers |url=https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375082?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;oco=1 |website=Drive Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[iPhone]]s and [[iPad]]s running [[iOS 8]] or later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=System requirements and browsers |url=https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375082?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&amp;oco=1 |website=Drive Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Google Drive ended support for Android devices running [[Android Ice Cream Sandwich|Android 4.0 "Ice Cream Sandwich"]] or older versions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Whitwam |title=Drive app update ends support for ICS, adds in-app storage upgrades, and more |url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/08/23/drive-app-update-ends-support-ics-adds-storage-plan-upgrades/ |website=Android Police |date=August 23, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing Google's mobile app update policy, which states: "For Android devices, we provide updates for the current and 2 previous Android versions." According to the policy, the app will continue to work for devices running older Android versions, but any app updates are provided on a best-efforts basis. The policy also states a notice will be given for any planned end of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Updates to G Suite mobile apps |url=https://support.google.com/a/answer/6288871 |website=G Suite Administrator Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Website interface ===
Google Drive has a website that allows users to see their files from any Internet-connected computer, without the need to download an app.

The website received a visual overhaul in 2014 that gave it a completely new look and improved performance. It also simplified some of the most common tasks, such as clicking only once on a file to see recent activity or share the file, and added drag-and-drop functionality, where users can simply drag selected files to folders, for improved organization.&lt;ref name="Meet the new Google Drive"&gt;{{cite web |title=Meet the new Google Drive |url=https://drive.googleblog.com/2014/06/meet-new-google-drive_25.html |website=Google Drive Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=June 25, 2014 |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Crider |title=Google Drive Gets A Shiny New Interface On The Web, Rolling Out To Users Starting Now |url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/07/08/google-drive-gets-a-shiny-new-interface-on-the-web-rolling-out-to-users-starting-today/ |website=Android Police |date=July 8, 2014 |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new update in August 2016 changed several visual elements of the website; the logo was updated, search box design was refreshed, and the primary color was changed from red to blue. It also improved the functionality to download files locally from the website; users can now compress and download large Drive items into multiple 2 GB .zip files with an improved naming structure, better Google Forms handling, and empty folders will now be included in the [[Zip (file format)|.zip]], thereby preserving the user's folder hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Improvements to downloading files and folders in Google Drive on the web |url=https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2016/08/improvements-to-downloading-files-and-folders-in-Drive.html |website=G Suite Updates |publisher=[[Google]] |date=August 18, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Whitwam |title=Google Drive on the web gets UI tweaks, better file downloads, and more |url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/08/18/google-drive-web-gets-ui-tweaks-better-file-downloads/ |website=Android Police |date=August 18, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google gives every user 15 GB of free storage though [[Google One]], [[Google Docs, Sheets and Slides]] files do not count towards the storage limit.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://one.google.com/storage|title=Sign in - Google Accounts|website=one.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cloud storage is also shared with [[Gmail]] and [[Google Photos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lifehacker.com/google-one-is-now-open-for-everyone-but-is-it-a-good-d-1826049257|title=Google One Is Now Available to Everyone in the U.S., But Is It a Good Deal?|last=Murphy|first=David|work=Lifehacker|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unlimited number of photos at maximum 16 [[megapixel]]s and videos at maximum [[1080p]] resolutions are stored for free using the "High quality" setting in Google Photos. Using the "Original quality" setting uses Google Drive quota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Choose a storage size |url=https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6220791 |website=Google Photos Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users can purchase additional space through either a monthly or yearly payment. The option of yearly payments was introduced in December 2016, and is limited to the 100 GB or 1 TB storage plans. Furthermore, the yearly payments offer a discount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Ruddock |title=Nice: Google Drive adds annual billing - with discounts - for 100GB and 1TB plans |url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/12/21/nice-google-drive-adds-annual-billing-with-discounts-for-100gb-and-1tb-plans/ |website=Android Police |date=December 21, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018, Google announced that storage plans (including the free 15 gigabyte plan) would be moved over to [[Google One]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.blog.google/products/google-one/one-simple-way-get-more-out-google/|title=One simple way to get more out of Google|date=2018-05-14|work=Google|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google offers 30 GB of Drive storage for all [[G Suite]] Basic customers, and unlimited storage for those using G Suite Business or G Suite for Education, as long as there are at least 5 members. Associations with less than 5 members get 1 TB per user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Options for adding Drive storage |url=https://support.google.com/a/answer/177064 |website=G Suite Administrator Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Storage scheme revisions ===
Before the introduction of Google Drive, [[Google Docs, Sheets and Slides|Google Docs]] initially provided 15 GB of storage free of charge.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
On April 24, 2012, Google Drive was introduced with free storage of 5 GB. Storage plans were revised, with 25GB costing $2.49/month, 100GB costing $4.99/month and 1TB costing $49.99/month.&lt;ref name="Introducing Google Drive"/&gt;

Originally, [[Gmail]], Google Docs and [[Picasa]] had separate allowances for free storage and a shared allowance for purchased storage.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Between April 2012 and May 2013, Google Drive and Google+ Photos had a shared allowance for both free and purchased storage, whereas Gmail had a separate 10 GB storage limit, which increased to 25 GB on the purchase of any storage plan.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In September 2012, Google announced that a paid plan would now cover total storage, rather than the paid allocation being added to the free; e.g. a 100 GB plan allowed a total of 100 GB rather than 115 GB as previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Yossi |last=Matias |title=More spring cleaning |url=https://googleblog.blogspot.no/2012/09/more-spring-cleaning.html |website=Official Google Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=September 28, 2012 |accessdate=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Google announced the overall merge of storage across Gmail, Google Drive and Google+ Photos, allowing users 15 GB of unified free storage between the services.&lt;ref name="Unified storage"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drive.googleblog.com/2013/05/bringing-it-all-together-15-gb-now.html|title=Bringing it all together: 15 GB now shared between Drive, Gmail, and Google+ Photos|last=Bavor|first=Clay|date=May 13, 2013|website=Google Drive Blog|publisher=[[Google]]|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the storage plans were revised again and prices were reduced by 80% to $1.99/month for 100 GB, $9.99/month for 1TB, and $99.99/month for 10 TB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Johnston |title=Save more with Google Drive |url=https://drive.googleblog.com/2014/03/save-more-with-google-drive.html |website=Google Drive Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=March 13, 2014 |accessdate=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was much cheaper than competitors [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] and [[OneDrive]] offered at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mike |last=Epstein |title=Google Drive's new prices make Dropbox, OneDrive seem like ripoffs |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/google-slashes-google-drive-prices/ |website=[[Digital Trends]] |date=March 13, 2014 |accessdate=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the paid plans were re-branded as '''[[Google One]]''' to emphasize their application beyond Google Drive, along with the addition of a $2.99/month plan for 200&amp;nbsp;GB, and increasing the $9.99 plan to 2&amp;nbsp;TB at no additional charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/15/17693006/google-one-cloud-storage-plans-launch|title=Google One launches with cheaper cloud storage plans|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases during these changes, users could continue with their existing plans as long as they kept their accounts active and did not make any adjustments to the plan. However, if the account lapsed for any reason, users had to choose from current plans.

== Features ==
=== Sharing ===
Google Drive incorporates a system of file sharing in which the creator of a file or folder is, by default, its owner. The owner can regulate the public visibility of the file or folder. Ownership is transferable. Files or folders can be shared privately with particular users having a [[Google account]], using their ''@gmail.com'' email addresses. Sharing files with users not having a Google account requires making them accessible to "anybody with the link". This generates a secret URL for the file, which may be shared via email or private messages. Files and folders can also be made "public on the web", which means that they can be indexed by search engines and thus can be found and accessed by anyone. The owner may also set an access level for regulating permissions. The three access levels offered are "can edit", "can comment" and "can view". Users with editing access can invite others to edit.

=== Third-party apps ===
A number of external [[web application]]s that work with Google Drive are available from the [[Chrome Web Store]]. To add an app, users are required to sign into the Chrome Web Store, but the apps are compatible with all supported web browsers. Some of these apps are first-party, such as Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. Drive apps operate on the online files, and can be used to view, edit and create files in various formats, edit images and videos, fax and sign documents, manage projects, create flowcharts, etc. Drive apps can also be made the default for handling file formats supported by them. Some of these apps also work offline on [[Google Chrome]] and [[Chrome OS]].&lt;ref name="about third-party apps"&gt;{{cite web |title=Use Google Drive apps |url=https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2500820 |website=Drive Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alex |last=Chitu |title=Chrome and Google Drive's Third-Party Apps |url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.no/2012/04/chrome-and-google-drives-third-party.html |date=April 25, 2012 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the third-party apps are free to install. However, some have fees associated with continued usage or access to additional features. Saving data from a third-party app to Google Drive requires authorization the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Todd |last=Ogasawara |title=Google Drive Third-Party Apps: An Introduction |url=http://www.informationweek.com/consumer/google-drive-third-party-apps-an-introduction/d/d-id/1108780 |website=[[InformationWeek]] |publisher=UBM Tech |date=February 22, 2013 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Google Drive software development kit (SDK) works together with the Google Drive user interface and the Chrome Web Store to create an ecosystem of apps that can be installed into Google Drive. In February 2013, the "Create" menu in Google Drive was revamped to include third-party apps, thus effectively granting them the same status as Google's own apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nicolas |last=Garnier |title=Elevate your apps in Google Drive |url=https://developers.googleblog.com/2013/02/elevate-your-apps-in-google-drive.html |website=Google Developers Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=February 8, 2013 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Emil |last=Protalinski |title=Google Drive's Create menu now lets you add and access third-party, Drive-enabled apps |url=https://thenextweb.com/google/2013/02/08/google-drives-create-menu-now-lets-you-add-and-access-third-party-drive-enabled-apps/ |website=The Next Web |date=February 8, 2013 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, Google released an [[Application programming interface|API]] for Google Drive that enables third-party developers to build collaborative apps that support real-time editing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Cairns |title=Build collaborative apps with Google Drive Realtime API |url=https://developers.googleblog.com/2013/03/build-collaborative-apps-with-google.html |website=Google Developers Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=March 19, 2013 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Aaron |last=Souppouris |title=Google Drive now allows third-party apps to edit docs in realtime |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/19/4123822/google-drive-realtime-api-opens-door-to-developers-to-create-drive-apps |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=March 19, 2013 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quick Access ===
Introduced in the Android app in September 2016, Quick Access uses [[machine learning]] to "intelligently predict the files you need before you've even typed anything".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Cayden |last=Meyer |title=Save time with Quick Access in Drive |url=https://blog.google/products/drive/save-time-with-quick-access-in-drive/ |website=The Keyword Google Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=September 29, 2016 |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Corbin |last=Davenport |title=Google Drive adds Quick Access feature, guesses what file you might want |url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/09/29/google-drive-adds-quick-access-feature-available-g-suite-customers/ |website=Android Police |date=September 29, 2016 |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feature was announced to be expanded to [[iOS]] and the [[Web application|web]] in March 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jordan |last=Novet |title=Google revamps Drive with File Stream and expanded Quick Access, launches Gmail add-ons |url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/03/09/google-revamps-drive-with-file-stream-and-expanded-quick-access-launches-gmail-add-ons/ |website=[[VentureBeat]] |date=March 9, 2017 |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the website interface received the feature in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryne |last=Hager |title=The Quick Access feature in Google Drive for Android is coming to Drive on the web |url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/18/quick-access-feature-google-drive-android-coming-drive-web/ |website=Android Police |date=May 18, 2017 |accessdate=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Search ===
Search results can be narrowed by file type, ownership, visibility, and the open-with app. Users can search for images by describing or naming what is in them. For example, a search for "mountain" returns all the photos of mountains, as well as any text documents about mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nicolas |last=Garnier |title=How to make files searchable in Google Drive |url=https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/2013/02/how-to-make-files-searchable-in-google.html |website=G Suite Developers Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=February 27, 2013 |accessdate=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Text in images and [[PDF]]s can be extracted using [[optical character recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Convert PDF and photo files to text |url=https://support.google.com/drive/answer/176692 |website=Drive Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, Google added "natural language processing" for searching on the Google Drive website, enabling specific user search queries like "find my budget spreadsheet from last December".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Smith |title=What you love about Google Search—now for Drive |url=https://blog.google/products/drive/what-you-love-about-google-search-now/ |website=The Keyword Google Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=September 20, 2016 |accessdate=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, Google integrated Drive and the Google Search app on Android, letting users search for keywords, switch to an "In Apps" tab, and see any relevant Drive files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Napier |last=Lopez |title=Android users can now find Google Drive files right in Search |url=https://thenextweb.com/google/2017/02/23/android-users-can-now-find-google-drive-files-right-search/ |website=The Next Web |date=February 23, 2017 |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Ravenscraft |title=You Can Now Use Google to Search Your Drive Files On Android |url=http://lifehacker.com/you-can-now-use-google-to-search-your-drive-files-on-an-1792699850 |website=[[Lifehacker]] |publisher=[[Univision Communications]] |date=February 24, 2017 |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Lulu |last=Chang |title=You can now find your Google Drive files directly through the Android Google app |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/android-google-app-drive/ |website=[[Digital Trends]] |date=February 24, 2017 |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Backups ===
In December 2016, Google updated the Android app and website with a "Backups" section, listing the Android device and app backups saved to Drive. The section lets users see what backups are stored, the backups' sizes and details, and delete backups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rita |last=El Khoury |title=[Update: Available on Android] Google Drive Backups tab starts showing up, gives you a glimpse into your device and app backups |url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/12/08/google-drive-backups-tab-starts-showing-gives-glimpse-device-app-backups/ |website=Android Police |date=December 8, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Google announced that a new app, "Backup and Sync", would be able to synchronize any folder on the user's computer to Google.&lt;ref name="Verge Backup and Sync"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jacob |last=Kastrenakes |title=Google Drive will soon back up your entire computer |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/14/15802200/google-backup-and-sync-app-announced-drive-feature |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 14, 2017 |accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TNW Backup and Sync"&gt;{{cite web |first=Abhimanyu |last=Ghoshal |title=Google Drive will automatically back up your hard drive later this month |url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2017/06/15/google-drive-will-automatically-back-up-your-hard-drive-later-this-month/ |website=The Next Web |date=June 15, 2017 |accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The app was released on July 12, 2017.&lt;ref name="The Verge new app"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ars Technica new app"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch new app"/&gt;

=== Metadata ===
A Description field is available for both files and folders that users can use to add relevant metadata. Content within the Description field is also indexed by Google Drive and searchable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rebecca |last=Steelman |title=Tips &amp; Tricks: Using the description field in your documents list |url=https://drive.googleblog.com/2011/06/tips-tricks-using-description-field-in.html |website=Google Drive Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=June 14, 2011 |accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accessibility to the visually impaired ===
In June 2014, Google announced a number of updates to Google Drive, which included making the service more accessible to visually impaired users. This included improved keyboard accessibility, support for zooming and high contrast mode, and better compatibility with screen readers.&lt;ref name="Meet the new Google Drive"/&gt;

=== ''Save to Google Drive'' browser extension ===
Google offers an [[Google Chrome Extensions|extension for Google Chrome]], ''Save to Google Drive'', that allows users to save web content to Google Drive through a browser action or through the context menu. While documents and images can be saved directly, webpages can be saved in the form of a [[screenshot]] (as an image of the visible part of the page or the entire page), or as a raw [[HTML]], [[MHTML]], or Google Docs file. Users need to be signed into Chrome to use the extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Save to Google Drive |url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-google-drive/gmbmikajjgmnabiglmofipeabaddhgne |website=[[Chrome Web Store]] |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile apps ===
The main Google Drive mobile app supported editing of documents and spreadsheets until April 2014, when the capability was moved to separate, standalone apps for [[Google Docs]], [[Google Sheets]], and [[Google Slides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Levee |title=New mobile apps for Docs, Sheets and Slides - work offline and on the go |url=https://googleblog.blogspot.no/2014/04/new-mobile-apps-for-docs-sheets-and.html |website=Official Google Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=April 30, 2014 |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Bogdan |last=Petrovan |title=Google launches standalone Docs, Sheets, and Slides apps for Android |url=http://www.androidauthority.com/google-docs-sheets-slides-2-375092/ |website=Android Authority |date=April 30, 2014 |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Google Drive app on Android allows users to take a photo of a document, sign, or other text and use [[optical character recognition]] to convert to text that can be edited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Reuben |last=Kan |title=Introducing the new Google Docs app for Android |url=http://googlemobile.blogspot.no/2011/04/introducing-new-google-docs-app-for.html |website=Google Mobile Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=April 27, 2011 |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, the Android app was updated with a [[Material Design]] user interface, improved search, the ability to add a custom message while sharing a file, and a new PDF viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New version of the Google Drive app for Android |url=https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2014/10/new-version-of-google-drive-app-for.html |website=G Suite Updates |publisher=[[Google]] |date=October 29, 2014 |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Liam |last=Spradlin |title=A Look At Google Drive's Material Design In Android 5.0 Lollipop |url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/10/21/a-look-at-google-drives-material-design-in-android-5-0-lollipop/ |website=Android Police |date=October 21, 2014 |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Encryption ===
Before 2013, Google did not [[encrypt]] data stored on its servers. Following information that the United States' [[National Security Agency]] had "direct access" to servers owned by multiple technology companies, including Google,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Glenn |last1=Greenwald |first2=Ewen |last2=MacAskill |title=NSA Prism program taps in to user data of Apple, Google and others |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=June 7, 2013 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company began testing encrypting data in July&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Declan |last=McCullaugh |title=Google tests encryption to protect users' Drive files against government demands |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-tests-encryption-to-protect-users-drive-files-against-government-demands/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=July 17, 2013 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enabled encryption for data in transit between its data centers in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sean |last=Gallagher |title=Googlers say “F*** you” to NSA, company encrypts internal network |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/googlers-say-f-you-to-nsa-company-encrypts-internal-network/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=November 6, 2013 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2015, Google Drive does not provide [[client-side encryption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tom |last=McNamara |title=How to make Google Drive more secure |url=http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/how-to-make-google-drive-more-secure/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=July 8, 2015 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Google Drive for Work ===
Google Drive for Work is a business version, a part of [[G Suite]] (formerly Google Apps for Work), announced at the [[Google I/O]] conference on June 25, 2014 and made available immediately. The service features unlimited storage, advanced file audit reporting and eDiscovery services, along with enhanced administration control and new [[Application programming interface|APIs]] specifically useful to businesses. Users can upload files as large as 5 TB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Bryan |last=Bishop |title=Google announces Drive for Work with unlimited storage at $10 a month |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/25/5842108/google-announces-drive-for-work-with-unlimited-storage-at-10-a-month |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 25, 2014 |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A press release posted on Google's Official Enterprise Blog assured businesses that Google will encrypt data stored on its servers, as well as information being transmitted to or from them. Google will deliver 24/7 phone support to business users and has guaranteed 99.9% uptime for its servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Johnston |title=Unlimit your business with Google Drive for Work |url=https://cloud.googleblog.com/2014/06/unlimit-your-business-with-google-drive.html |website=Official Google Cloud Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=June 25, 2014 |accessdate=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Google announced that Google Drive for Work would be compliant with the new ISO/IEC 27018:2014 security and privacy standard, which confirmed that Google would not use data in Drive for Work accounts for advertising, enabled additional tools for handling and exporting data, more transparency about data storage, and protection from third-party data requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Marc |last=Crandall |title=Google Apps for Work adopts ISO 27018 cloud privacy standard |url=https://cloud.googleblog.com/2015/09/Google-Apps-for-Work-adopts-ISO-27018-cloud-privacy-standard.html |website=Official Google Cloud Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=September 21, 2015 |accessdate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, Google introduced Drive File Stream, making it possible for G Suite customers on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS]] computers to search their Drive folders and download specific files on-demand rather than downloading all files during installation, potentially preventing large amounts of data from "gobbling up your hard drive". Additionally, the feature will guess what files users need in the future and download those files as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alex |last=Vogenthaler |title=Introducing new, enterprise-ready tools for Google Drive |url=https://blog.google/products/g-suite/introducing-new-enterprise-ready-tools-google-drive/ |website=The Keyword Google Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=March 9, 2017 |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Whitwam |title=Drive File Stream for G Suite lets you access all your files without using all your disk space |url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/09/drive-file-stream-g-suite-lets-access-files-without-using-disk-space/ |website=Android Police |date=March 9, 2017 |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Google Drive for Education ===
Google Drive for Education was announced on September 30, 2014. It was made available for free to all Google Apps for Education users. It includes unlimited storage and support for individual files up to 5TB in size in addition to full encryption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Summers |title=Google unveils Drive for Education with free, unlimited storage and 'Classroom' integration |url=https://thenextweb.com/google/2014/09/30/google-unveils-drive-education-free-unlimited-storage-automatic-file-encryption/ |website=The Next Web |date=September 30, 2014 |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Team Drives ===
In September 2016, Google announced Team Drives, a new way for teams to collaborate. Sharing and file ownership are managed for the entire team rather than one individual, and new users instantly get access to all files and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Early Adopter Programs: Team Drives and a new Hangouts video meetings experience |url=https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2016/09/new-early-adopter-programs-team-drives.html |website=G Suite Updates |publisher=[[Google]] |date=September 29, 2016 |accessdate=January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Google opened an Early Adopter Program, allowing G Suite Business and G Suite for Education customers to sign up, although Google noted that some functionality isn't yet supported by Team Drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google Team Drives Early Adopter Program now accepting applications |url=https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2016/11/google-team-drives-early-adopter.html |website=G Suite Updates |publisher=[[Google]] |date=November 21, 2016 |accessdate=January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Docs, Sheets and Slides ==


[[Google Docs]], [[Google Sheets]], [[Google Slides]], and [[Google Forms]] constitute a free, web-based office suite offered by Google and integrated with Google Drive. It allows users to create and edit documents, spreadsheets, and presentations online while collaborating in real-time with other users. The three apps are available as [[web application]]s, as [[Chrome app]]s that work offline, and as [[mobile app]]s for Android and iOS. The apps are compatible with [[Microsoft Office]] file formats. The suite also consists of [[Google Forms]], [[Google Drawings]] and [[Google Fusion Tables]]. While Forms and Tables are only available as web applications, Drawings is also available as a Chrome app. The suite is tightly integrated with Google Drive, and all files created with the apps are by default saved to Google Drive.

===Updates===

Updates to Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms have introduced features using [[machine learning]], including "Explore", offering search results based on the contents of a document, answers based on [[Natural language processing|natural language]] questions in a spreadsheet, and dynamic design suggestions based on contents of a slideshow, and "Action items", allowing users to assign tasks to other users.
While Google Docs has been criticized for lacking the functionality of [[Microsoft Office]], it has received praise for its simplicity, ease of collaboration and frequent product updates.

In order to view and edit Docs, Sheets, or Slides documents offline, users need to be using the Google Chrome web browser. A [[Google Chrome#Extensions|Chrome extension]], ''Google Docs Offline'', allows users to enable offline support for Docs, Sheets and Slides files on the Google Drive website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Work on Google files offline |url=https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375012 |website=Drive Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google also offers an extension for the Google Chrome web browser called ''Office editing for Docs, Sheets and Slides'' that enables users to view and edit Microsoft Office documents on Google Chrome, via the Docs, Sheets and Slides apps. The extension can be used for opening Office files stored on the computer using Chrome, as well as for opening Office files encountered on the web (in the form of email attachments, web search results, etc.) without having to download them. The extension is installed on Chrome OS by default.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Office Editing for Docs, Sheets &amp; Slides |url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/office-editing-for-docs-s/gbkeegbaiigmenfmjfclcdgdpimamgkj |website=[[Chrome Web Store]] |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Google Drawings==

Google Drawings allows users to collaborate creating, sharing, and editing images or drawings. Google Drawings can be used for creating charts, diagrams, designs, flow-charts, etc. It contains a subset of the features in Google Slides but with different templates. Its features include laying out drawings precisely with alignment guides, snap to grid, auto distribution, and inserting drawings into other Google documents, spreadsheets, or presentations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Create &amp; edit drawings |url=https://support.google.com/docs/answer/179740 |website=Docs editors Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
=== Features ===
In a review of Google Drive after its launch in April 2012, Dan Grabham of ''[[TechRadar]]'' wrote that the integration of Google Docs into Google Drive was "a bit confusing", mainly due to the differences in the [[user interface]]s between the two, where Drive offers a "My Drive" section with a specific "Shared with me" view for shared documents. He stated that "We think the user interface needs a lot more work. It's like a retread of Google Docs at the moment and Google surely needs to do work here". He considered uploading files "fairly easy", but noted that folder upload was only supported through the [[Google Chrome]] web browser. The lack of native editing of [[Microsoft Office]] documents was "annoying". Regarding Google Drive's computer apps, he stated that the option in Settings to synchronize only specific folders was "powerful". He wrote that Drive was "a great addition to Google armoury of apps and everything does work seamlessly", while again criticizing the interface for being "confusing" and that the file view was "not quite intuitive enough" without file icons. Grabham also reviewed the mobile Android app, writing that "it's a pretty simple app that enables you to access your files on the move and save some for offline access should you wish", and praised Google Docs creation and photo uploading for being "easy". He also praised that "everything is easily searchable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Grabham |title=Hands on: Google Drive review |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/web/hands-on-google-drive-review-1077614 |website=[[TechRadar]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |date=April 27, 2012 |accessdate=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review by Michael Muchmore of ''[[PC Magazine]]'' in February 2016 praised the service as "truly impressive" in creating and editing files, describing its features as "leading" in office-suite collaboration. He added that "Compatibility is rarely an issue", with importing and exporting options, and that the free storage of 15&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte]]s was "generous". However, he also criticized the user interface for being confusing to navigate, and wrote that "Offline editing isn't simple".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Muchmore |title=Google Drive |url=http://uk.pcmag.com/google-drive/15854/review/google-drive |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 23, 2016 |accessdate=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Android version of Google Drive has been criticized for requiring users to individually toggle each file for use offline instead of allowing entire folders to be stored offline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.labnol.org/software/android-file-shortcuts-google-drive/31351/|title=How to Place Files Shortcuts on Android Home Screen with Google Drive|website=www.labnol.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ownership and licensing ===
Immediately after its announcement in April 2012, Google faced criticism over Google Drive privacy. In particular, privacy advocates have noted that Google has one unified set of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy agreements for all its products and services. In a ''[[CNET]]'' report, Zack Whittaker noted that "the terms and service have come under heavy fire by the wider community for how it handles users' copyright and intellectual property rights". In a comparison of Terms of Service agreements between Google Drive and competing cloud storage services [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] and [[OneDrive]], he cited a paragraph stating that Google has broad rights to reproduce, use, and create [[derivative work]]s from content stored on Google Drive, via a license from its users. Although the user retains intellectual property rights, the user licenses Google to extract and parse uploaded content to customize advertising and other services that Google provides to the user, and to promote the service. Summarized, he wrote that "According to its terms, Google does not own user-uploaded files to Google Drive, but the company can do whatever it likes with them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Zack |last=Whittaker |title=Who owns your files on Google Drive? |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/who-owns-your-files-on-google-drive/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=May 29, 2014 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a highly critical editorial of the service, Ed Bott of ''[[ZDNet]]'' wrote that language in the agreements contained "exact same words" as Dropbox used in a July 2011 Privacy Policy update that sparked criticism and forced Dropbox to update its policy once again with clarifying language, adding that "It's a perfect example of Google's inability to pay even the slightest bit of attention to anything that happens outside the Googleplex".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ed |last=Bott |title=Google clones Dropbox: lock, stock, and privacy gaffe |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-clones-dropbox-lock-stock-and-privacy-gaffe/ |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=April 24, 2012 |accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Peckham of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' criticized the lack of unique service agreements for Drive, writing that "If any Google service warrants privacy firewalling, it’s Google Drive. This isn’t YouTube or Calendar or even Gmail——the potential for someone’s most sensitive data to be snooped, whether to glean info for marketing or otherwise, is too high. [...] Google ought to create a privacy exception that “narrows the scope” of its service terms for Google Drive, one that minimally states the company will never circulate the information generated from searching {{sic|''within''}} your G-Drive data in any way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matt |last=Peckham |title=Will Google Drive Snoop Inside Your Data? Google Needs to Be Clearer |url=http://techland.time.com/2012/04/26/will-google-drive-snoop-inside-your-data-google-needs-to-be-clearer/ |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |date=April 26, 2012 |accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a report by Nilay Patel of ''[[The Verge]]'' stated that "all web services should be subject to harsh scrutiny of their privacy policies—but a close and careful reading reveals that Google's terms are pretty much the same as anyone else's, and slightly better in some cases", pointing to the fact that Google "couldn't move files around on its servers, cache your data, or make image thumbnails" without proper rights. In comparing the policies with competing services, Patel wrote that "it's clear that they need the exact same permissions—they just use slightly more artful language to communicate them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nilay |last=Patel |title=Is Google Drive worse for privacy than iCloud, Skydrive, and Dropbox? |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/25/2973849/google-drive-terms-privacy-data-skydrive-dropbox-icloud |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=April 25, 2012 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Growth ==
On November 12, 2013, Google announced that Google Drive had 120 million active users, a figure that the company was releasing for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Gmail Users No Longer Need To Download Attachments, As Google Drive Gets Baked Into The Inbox |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/12/gmail-users-no-longer-need-to-download-attachments-as-google-drive-gets-baked-into-the-inbox/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=November 12, 2013 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 25, 2014 at the [[Google I/O]] developer conference, [[Sundar Pichai]] announced that Google Drive now had 190 million monthly active users, and that it was being used by 58% of the [[Fortune 500]] companies as well as by 72 of the top universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kia |last=Kokalitcheva |title=Google Drive now has 190M users &amp; a brand new tablet app for presentations |url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/06/25/google-drive-now-has-190m-users-a-brand-new-tablet-app-for-presentations/ |website=[[VentureBeat]] |date=June 25, 2014 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2014, at its Atmosphere Live event, it was announced that Google Drive had 240 million monthly active users. ''The Next Web'' noted that this meant an increase of 50 million users in just one quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Emil |last=Protalinski |title=Google announces 10% price cut for all Compute Engine instances, Google Drive has passed 240M active users |url=https://thenextweb.com/google/2014/10/01/google-announces-10-price-cut-compute-engine-instances-google-drive-passed-240m-active-users/ |website=The Next Web |date=October 1, 2014 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2015, it was announced that Google Drive had over one million organizational paying users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Johnston |title=Making Google Drive the safest place for all your work |url=https://medium.com/@gsuite/making-google-drive-the-safest-place-for-all-your-work-b5248f9b9ddc |website=[[Medium (website)|Medium]] |date=September 21, 2015 |accessdate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, a Google executive stated at a company event that there were over two trillion files stored on Google Drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rob |last=Price |title=Google Drive now hosts more than 2 trillion files |url=http://nordic.businessinsider.com/2-trillion-files-google-drive-exec-prabhakar-raghavan-2017-5 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=May 6, 2017 |accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Humphries |title=Google Drive Passes 2 Trillion Files Stored |url=http://uk.pcmag.com/cloud-services/89223/news/google-drive-passes-2-trillion-files-stored |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff David]] |date=May 8, 2017 |accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Downtime issues ==
Although Google has a 99.9% uptime guarantee for Google Drive for [[G Suite]] customers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reliability |url=https://support.google.com/work/answer/6056635 |website=Google Cloud Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google Drive has suffered downtimes for both consumers and business users.

When the January 2016 outage was resolved, a Google spokesperson told ''The Next Web'':&lt;ref name="January 2016 service outage"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At Google we recognize that failures are statistically inevitable, and we strive to insulate our users from the effects of failures. As that did not happen in this instance, we apologize to everyone who was inconvenienced by this event. Our engineers are conducting a post-mortem investigation to determine how to make our services more resilient to unplanned network failures, and we will do our utmost to continue to make Google service outages notable for their rarity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an outage that affected all of Google's services for 5 minutes in August 2013, [[CNET]] reported that global Internet traffic dropped 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Svetlik |title=Google goes down for 5 minutes, Internet traffic drops 40% |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-goes-down-for-5-minutes-internet-traffic-drops-40/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=August 19, 2013 |accessdate=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCC has a well‑established discretion, albeit one that is narrow and should be exercised sparingly, to address the merits of a constitutional issue when proper notice of constitutional questions has been given in that Court, even though the issue was not properly raised in the courts below.
*Civil penalty proceedings under s. 163.2 of the ''Income Tax Act'' are of an administrative nature. They are not criminal in nature and do not lead to the imposition of true penal consequences. Therefore, G is not a person "charged with an offence" and accordingly, the protections under [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|s. 11]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter]]'' do not apply.

}}
{{cite CanLII|litigants='''Guindon v Canada'''|year=2015|court=scc|num=41}} is a landmark decision of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] on the distinction between criminal and regulatory penalties, for the purposes of [[Section 11 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|s.11]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. It also provides guidance on when the Court will consider constitutional issues when such had not been argued in the lower courts.

==Background==
Guindon, a lawyer who specialized in [[family law|family]] and [[probate|wills and estates]] law, was approached in 2001 by promoters of a [[Leverage (finance)|leveraged]] donation program which was said to operate in the following manner:

#Each participant in the program would acquire [[timeshare]] units of a resort in the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]].
#The participants would donate these units to a [[Charitable organization|charity]] at a [[fair market value]] greater than their cash payment for the timeshares.

Guindon agreed, for a fee, to provide an [[opinion|opinion letter]] on the tax consequences of this program on the basis of a precedent provided by the promoters. Although recommending that a [[tax lawyer]] and an [[accountant]] review her letter for accuracy, she proceeded to provide the letter to the promoters, knowing it would form part of their information package. The letter stated that the transactions would be implemented based on supporting documents that she had been provided with and had reviewed. However, she had not reviewed the supporting documents.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

A charity with which Guindon was connected agreed to become the recipient of the promoted timeshares. In reality, no timeshare units were created and no transfers from the donors to the charity occurred.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minister of National Revenue]] later disallowed the charitable donation tax credits claimed by the donors, and Guindon was assessed an [[Administrative Monetary Penalty|administrative monetary penalty]] in 2008 for each of the tax receipts disallowed,&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 6&lt;/ref&gt; amounting in total to almost $600,000.{{sfn|Spiro|2015}}

Guindon appealed the assessment to the [[Tax Court of Canada]], submitting that s. 163.2 of the ''Income Tax Act''{{efn|under which the penalties had been assessed}} created a [[criminal offence]], and thus was subject to the ''Charter'' protection afforded under [[Section 11 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|s.11]].&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==The courts below==
The TCC held that s. 163.2 was "by its very nature a criminal proceeding" and "involve[d] a sanction that is a true penal consequence,"&lt;ref&gt;TCC, par. 53&lt;/ref&gt; and in consequence vacated the assessment. Protests by the Crown that the constitutional issue was raised without proper notice{{efn|as required under the {{Cite canlaw|short title =Tax Court of Canada Act|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter =T-2|section = 19.2|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/T-2/section-19.2.html}}}} were overruled by the trial judge [[Paul Bédard|Bédard J]].&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] allowed the appeal, set aside the TCC's judgment, and restored the assessment against Guindon. In his ruling, [[David Stratas|Stratas JA]] held that:&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

#Guindon’s failure to serve notice of a constitutional question was fatal to the Tax Court’s jurisdiction;
#the TCC and the FCA, if asked to do so, could have exercised their discretion to adjourn the appeal to allow a notice to be served to address that matter, but Guindon did not make that request in either of the courts below; and
#s. 163.2 of the ''ITA'' is not a criminal offence and therefore does not engage s. 11 of the ''Charter''.

Leave to appeal to the SCC was granted in June 2013.

==At the SCC==
By a unanimous decision, the appeal was dismissed. However, the Justices split 4:3 as to whether the constitutional issue should have been considered without prior notice, and only the majority addressed the constitutional issue.

===Discretion of the Court===
While the minority considered the Court's prior ruling in ''Eaton v Brant County Board of Education''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Eaton v Brant County Board of Education|link=|year=1997|court=scc|num=366|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1997] 1 SCR 241|date=1997-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; as requiring a mandatory notice of a constitutional question, as it "gives governments an opportunity to present evidence justifying the constitutionality of the law and permits all parties to challenge that evidence," and "allowing a party unilaterally to make an end-run around notice requirements by claiming that demonstrably constitutional arguments are not in fact constitutional arguments, rewards linguistic tactics at the expense of the public interest."&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 92-97&lt;/ref&gt; The majority held that ''Eaton'' was not conclusive, as [[John Sopinka|Sopinka J]]'s judgment did not express a final opinion on the point. In addition, there have been numerous instances both before and after ''Eaton'' where the Court has addressed constitutional questions ''[[Ab initio|de novo]]'' without prior notice.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 15-39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engagement of s. 11===
S. 11 protection is available to those charged with criminal offences, not those subject to administrative sanctions, according to the test the Court has devised in ''[[R v Wigglesworth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=R v Wigglesworth|link=R v Wigglesworth|year=1997|court=scc|num=41|format=canlii|parallelcite=[1987] 2 SCR 541|date=1987-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which declares that a matter falls under s. 11 where;

#by its very nature it is a criminal proceeding, or
#a conviction in respect of the offence may lead to a true penal consequence.&lt;ref&gt;''Wigglesworth'', par. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, ''Martineau v MNR''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Martineau v MNR|link=|year=2004|court=scc|num=81|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[2004] 3 SCR 737|date=2004-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; declares that, in general, "proceedings of an administrative{{em dash}}private, internal or disciplinary{{em dash}}nature instituted for the protection of the public in accordance with the policy of a statute are not penal in nature."&lt;ref&gt;''Martineau'', par. 22, citing ''Wigglesworth'', par. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; To determine whether a proceeding is criminal or administrative in nature, the Court must examine "(1) the objectives of the [Act]; (2) the purpose of the sanction; and (3) the process leading to imposition of the sanction."&lt;ref&gt;''Martineau'', par. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present case, the Court declared that criticisms that the ''Wigglesworth/Martineau'' tests were unclear, circular in nature or not properly accounting for the modern context of administrative monetary penalties were unfounded, as:

#the "criminal in nature test" identifies provisions that are criminal because Parliament or the legislature has provided for proceedings whose attributes and purpose show that the penalty is to be imposed via criminal proceedings; and
#the "true penal consequence test" looks at whether an ostensibly administrative or regulatory provision nonetheless engages s. 11 of the ''Charter'' because it may result in punitive consequences.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case at bar, s. 163.2(4) of the ''ITA'' was held:

#not to be a criminal proceeding in nature, as "the purpose of this proceeding is to promote honesty and deter gross negligence, or worse, on the part of preparers, qualities that are essential to the self-reporting system of income taxation assessment"&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 62&lt;/ref&gt; and "[w]hile some regulatory penalties are imposed without consideration of the person’s state of mind, in other cases it is rational that the state would only wish to impose a penalty on those who engage in misconduct knowingly, recklessly, or with a particular intention."&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 72&lt;/ref&gt;
#not to attract a true penal consequence, as "high administrative monetary penalties [are] required to encourage compliance with the administrative regime. The relevant question is not the amount of the penalty in absolute terms, it is whether the amount serves regulatory rather than penal purposes."&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Several practical consequences were immediately apparent in ''Guindon'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thor.ca/blog/2015/08/what-the-supreme-court-of-canada-has-to-say-about-the-income-tax-act-and-penalties/|title= What the Supreme Court of Canada Has to Say About The Income Tax Act and Penalties|last1= Del Bigio|first1= Greg|date= August 19, 2015|website= |publisher= Thorsteinssons LLP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#If constitutional litigation is to be conducted, procedural requirements as to notice must be followed.
#The integrity and honesty of advisors, planners and tax preparers is equally important to the integrity of the self- reporting system.
#The objectives of the ''Income Tax Act'' are such that, at least in general terms, very significant penalties will not be prohibited by constitutional principles.

Commentators generally agree that ''Guindon'' is only a first step in the development of the case law concerning administrative proceedings:

:* It does not discuss the defences available against the imposition of [[Administrative Monetary Penalty|AMP]]s nor the issue of the burden of proof,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.canadianenergylawblog.com/2015/08/04/supreme_court_of_canada_upholds_the_constitutional_validity_of_administrative_monetary_penalties/|title= Supreme Court of Canada upholds the constitutional validity of administrative monetary penalties|last1= Gagné|first1= Michel|last2= Frémont|first2= Catherine|date= August 4, 2015|website= canadianenergylawblog.com|publisher= [[McCarthy Tétrault]]|access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the matter has already been explored in a 2015 case in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;''Excavation René St-Pierre Inc. c Québec'', [http://www.canlii.org/fr/qc/qctaq/doc/2015/2015canlii7296/2015canlii7296.html?autocompleteStr=Excavation%20Ren%C3%A9%20St-Pierre&amp;autocompletePos=1#showHeadnotes 2015 QCTAQ 02386]&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The ''Charter'' is not the only source of judicial protection in administrative proceedings, as procedural and substantive challenges on judicial review can ensure that the administration stays within the boundaries of legality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.administrativelawmatters.com/blog/2015/08/03/its-just-a-fine-guindon-v-canada-2015-scc-41/|title= It’s Just (a) Fine: ''Guindon v. Canada'', 2015 SCC 41|last1= Daly|first1= Paul |date= August 3, 2015|website= administrativelawmatters.com|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The absence of s. 11 protection of the presumption of innocence is of great concern, although it is conceded that the legal system may grind to a halt if every allegation of misconduct could be tested in a full criminal proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.gowlings.com/KnowledgeCentre/article.asp?pubID=4091|title= Tax preparer penalties not criminal sanction: The SCC judgment in ''Guindon''|last1= Sorenson|first1= John|date= August 2015|website= |publisher= [[Gowlings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* It will be difficult to challenge other AMPs imposed in the absence of procedural safeguards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Schmitz|first= Cristin|date= September 2015|title= Way paved for more fines given SCC penalty decision|url= http://thebottomlinenews.ca/articles/783|location=Toronto|newspaper= The Bottom Line|publisher= LexisNexis Canada Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The FCA provided more guidance in its judgment as to when an administrative penalty would be considered disproportionate,&lt;ref&gt;FCA, par. 44&lt;/ref&gt; and it would have been helpful if the SCC had expanded on the point.{{sfn|Spiro|2015}} However, in 2012 the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] gave a reasoned evaluation for a monetary penalty that arose from a securities proceeding, which could be useful in future jurisprudence.{{sfn|Spiro|2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Rowan v. Ontario Securities Commission|link=|year=2012|court=onca|num=208|pinpoint=par. 52, 55|parallelcite=110 OR (3d) 492|date=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3000">'''High-performance green buildings''' are those which deliver a relatively higher level of energy-efficiency performance than that required by building codes or other regulations. Architects, designers, and builders typically design and build them using a range of established strategies, techniques, tools, and materials to ensure that, upon completion, the building will consume a minimal amount of energy for heating, cooling, illumination, and ventilation during operation.

== Occupant benefits ==
High performance buildings deliver a wide range of benefits to owners and tenants. Because they require relatively less energy to heat, cool, and ventilate, such buildings often yield lower utility costs. Occupants often prefer living, working, and learning in high-performance buildings because they better manage:

* Temperature, improving comfort.
* Fresh air throughout the building, improving health.
* Soundproofing, reducing exterior noise.

A 2012 study by the [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] found that multifamily buildings present a tremendous opportunity for energy savings. Comprehensive, cost-effective upgrades in multifamily buildings could improve efficiency by 15-30%, the Council found, representing an annual sector-wide savings of almost USD$3.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Multifamily Energy Savings Project|url=http://aceee.org/multifamily-project|website=The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate benefits ==

Globally, buildings constitute a leading consumer of energy and a significant source of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. In 2010 buildings accounted for 32% of total global final energy use, 19% of energy-related GHG emissions, including emissions produced in the production of electricity that is used by buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change. Contribution of Working Group III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg3/|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, United Nations|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States in 2016, carbon emissions from homes and commercial businesses contributed 6,511 million metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent to the atmosphere, or 11 percent of the nation's total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions|url=https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions#commercial-and-residential|website=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments with jurisdiction over building codes and standards and that are interested in reducing the climate impact of buildings may seek to reduce these emissions by either incentivizing requiring higher levels of energy efficiency performance in new homes and other buildings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54063">'''Humanitarian Intervention''' has been defined as a state's use of "military force (publicly stated that its use is for ending the violation of human rights) against another state."&lt;ref name=Mises&gt;Marjanovic, Marko (2011-04-04) [http://mises.org/daily/5160/Is-Humanitarian-War-the-Exception Is Humanitarian War the Exception?], [[Mises Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; This definition may be too narrow as it precludes non-military forms of intervention such as [[humanitarian aid]] and [[international sanctions]]. On this broader understanding, "Humanitarian intervention should be understood to encompass… non-forcible methods, namely intervention undertaken without military force to alleviate mass human suffering within sovereign borders."&lt;ref&gt;Scheffer, David J. “Towards a Modern Doctrine of Humanitarian Intervention.” University of Toledo Law Review Vol 23. (1992): 253-274.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There is not one standard or legal definition of humanitarian intervention; the field of analysis (such as law, ethics or politics) often influences the definition that is chosen. Differences in definition include variations in whether humanitarian intervention is limited to instances where there is an absence of consent from the host state; whether humanitarian intervention is limited to punishment actions; and whether humanitarian intervention is limited to cases where there has been explicit [[UN Security Council]] authorization for action.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer M. Welsh. ''Humanitarian Intervention and International Relations.'' Ed. Jennifer M. Welsh. New York: Oxford University Press,  2004.&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, a general consensus on some of its essential characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;Alton Frye. 'Humanitarian Intervention: Crafting a Workable Doctrine.' New York: Council on Foreign Relations, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Humanitarian intervention involves the threat and use of military forces as a central feature
#It is an intervention in the sense that it entails interfering in the internal affairs of a state by sending military forces into the territory or airspace of a sovereign state that has not committed an act of aggression against another state.
#The intervention is in response to situations that do not necessarily pose direct threats to states' strategic interests, but instead is motivated by humanitarian objectives.

The customary international law concept of humanitarian intervention dates back to [[Hugo Grotius]] and the European politics in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, Jonah (2011). ''An Emerging Norm - Determining the Meaningand Legal Status of the Responsibility to Protect''. (Michigan Journal of International Law vol. 32, iss. 4 (2010-2011), p. 765-804). “The idea of sovereignty as an instrument for the protection of the life and safety of subjects is at least as old as Hugo Grotius, who made "the first authoritative statement of the principle of humanitarian intervention - the principle that exclusiveness of domestic jurisdiction stops when outrage upon humanity begins."”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justsecurity.org/1506/koh-syria-part2/ |author=Koh, Harold Hongju |title=Syria and the Law of Humanitarian Intervention (Part II: International Law and the Way Forward) |publisher=Just Security (justsecurity.org) |date=2 Oct 2013 |accessdate=22 Oct 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of humanitarian intervention has remained a compelling foreign policy issue, especially since [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|NATO's intervention in Kosovo in 1999]], as it highlights the tension between the principle of state [[sovereignty]] – a defining pillar of the [[United Nations Organization|UN]] system and [[international law]] – and evolving international norms related to human rights and the use of force.&lt;ref&gt;Shashi Tharoor and Sam Daws. "Humanitarian Intervention: Getting Past the Reefs." ''World Policy Journal'' 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it has sparked normative and empirical debates over its legality, the ethics of using military force to respond to human rights violations, when it should occur, who should intervene,&lt;ref name="WhoShould"&gt;James Pattison, ''Humanitarian Intervention and the Responsibility to Protect: Who Should Intervene?'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and whether it is effective.

To its proponents, it marks imperative action in the face of human rights abuses, over the rights of state sovereignty, while to its detractors it is often viewed as a pretext for military intervention often devoid of legal sanction, selectively deployed and achieving only ambiguous ends. Its frequent use following the end of the [[Cold War]] suggested to many that a new norm of military humanitarian intervention was emerging in international politics, although some now argue that the [[9/11 terrorist attacks]] and the US "[[war on terror]]" have brought the era of humanitarian intervention to an end.&lt;ref&gt;A. Cottey. "Beyond Humanitarian Intervention: The New Politics of Peacekeeping and Intervention." ''Contemporary Politics'' 2008: pp. 429–446.&lt;/ref&gt; James Pattison,&lt;!--Lecturer in Politics at the University of Manchester--&gt; however, argued in 2011 that the NATO intervention in Libya breaks this trend.&lt;ref&gt;James Pattison, “Introduction to Roundtable on Libya, RtoP, and Humanitarian Intervention.” "Ethics &amp; International Affairs" 2011: 251–4. {{doi|10.1017/S0892679411000189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Getting involved in the affairs of another state on humanitarian grounds has been a subject of discussion in [[public international law]] since the 19th century.

According to [[Jonathan Friedman]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]], explicit assertions about humanitarian motives are not a new phenomenon and military action is instead often rationalized through such moral rather than political arguments.&lt;ref name="Friedmanjames"&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2006 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Friedman | first2= Jonathan | title= Globalization and Violence, Vol. 3: Globalizing War and Intervention | url= https://www.academia.edu/3587732/Globalization_and_Violence_Vol._3_Globalizing_War_and_Intervention_editor_with_Jonathan_Friedman_Sage_Publications_London_2006 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=xxii}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a pretext for deploying troops in [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[Italian Eritrea]] for an intended invasion of [[Ethiopia]], [[Benito Mussolini]] thus claimed that he was attempting to both secure the Wal Wal border area where some Italian soldiers had been killed and abolish the local [[Slavery in Somalia|slave trade]].&lt;ref name="Townley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Townley|first1=Edward|title=Mussolini and Italy|date=2002|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=0435327259|page=107|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=Y7CIAYPTx2gC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Adolf Hitler]] justified his own forces' occupation of the [[Sudetenland]] by suggesting that they were attempting to quash ethnic tensions in [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name="Friedmanjames"/&gt;

[[File:George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron by Richard Westall (2).jpg|thumb|upright|Poet [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], a [[Philhellenism|Philhellene]] who fought for Greek independence.]]
Possibly the first historical example of a state expressly intervening in the internal affairs of another on the grounds of humanitarian concern was during the [[Greek War of Independence]] in the early 19th century, when [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]] and [[Russia]] decisively intervened in a naval engagement at [[Battle of Navarino|Navarino]] in 1827 to secure for the Greeks independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Popular opinion in England was sympathetic to the Greeks ([[philhellenism]]), in part due to the Greek origin of the West's classical heritage. The renowned poet [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] even took up arms to join the Greek revolutionaries,  while the London Philhellenic Committee was established to aid the Greek insurgents financially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wynne William H.|year=1951|title=State insolvency and foreign bondholders vol. 2|publisher=Yale University Press|page=284|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/State_Insolvency_and_Foreign_Bondholders.html?id=UdawMddRqaUC&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1823, after initial ambivalence, the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[George Canning]] declared that "when a whole nation revolts against its conqueror, the nation cannot be considered as piratical but as a nation in a state of war". In February that same year, he notified the Ottoman Empire that the United Kingdom would maintain friendly relations with the Turks only under the condition that the latter respected the Christian subjects of the Empire. He was also instrumental in the outcome of the St. Petersburg Protocol 1826, in which Russia and Britain agreed to mediate between the Ottomans and the Greeks on the basis of complete autonomy of Greece under Turkish sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'', pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt; When this did not end the War, Canning negotiated a following [[Treaty of London (1827)|treaty]] that ultimately led to the destruction of the Egyptian-Turkish fleet at the [[Battle of Navarino]].

[[File:French Expedition in Syria, The Times, Thursday, Aug 09, 1860.png|thumb|left|The 1860 French Expedition to intervene in the [[1860 Druze–Maronite conflict|Druze–Maronite conflict]] was described by ''[[The Times]]'' as stemming from humanitarian motives.]]
The treatment of minorities under the Ottoman aegis proved a rich source of liberal agitation throughout the nineteenth century. A multinational force under French leadership was sent to [[Lebanon]] to help restore peace after the [[1860 Druze–Maronite conflict]], in which thousands of Christian [[Maronite]]s had been massacred by the [[Druze]] population. Following an international outcry, the Ottoman Empire agreed on 3 August 1860 to the dispatch of up to 12,000 European soldiers to reestablish order.&lt;ref name="Chesterman 32"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DNUPcfTOIJEC&amp;pg=PA32 ''Just war or just peace?: humanitarian intervention and international law'' by Simón Chesterman p.32''ff'']&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement was further formalized in a convention on 5 September 1860 with [[Austria]], [[Great Britain]], [[France]], [[Prussia]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="Chesterman 32"/&gt;

In May 1876 Ottoman troops began [[Batak massacre|massacring]] unarmed agitators for autonomy in [[Bulgaria]], leading to the [[Eastern Question#Great Eastern Crisis|Eastern Crisis]]. The British launched a government investigation into the events, which confirmed that as part of an official policy, the Turks had killed at least 12,000 Bulgarians and obliterated about 60 villages. Lurid reports began to appear in newspapers, especially accounts by the investigative journalist [[William Thomas Stead]] in the [[Northern Echo]], and protest meetings were called across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Freedom_s_Battle.html?id=70g_Vd8AmO8C&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Freedom's Battle: The Origins of Humanitarian Intervention Part 4|author=Bass, Gary J.|year=2008|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Konstantin Makovsky - The Bulgarian martyresses.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''The Bulgarian Martyresses'' (1877), a painting by [[Konstantin Makovsky]], which shocked Europe.]]
Despite the unprecedented demonstration of the strength of public opinion and the media, the Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] remained an unmoved practitioner of ''[[realpolitik]]'', and considered British interests to lie in the preservation of Ottoman sovereignty in [[Eastern Europe]]. [[Lord Derby]] the Foreign Secretary disagreed and telegraphed the [[Sublime Porte]] that "any renewal of the outrages would be more fatal to the Porte than the loss of a battle." Apart from issuing stern advice and proposals for internal Turkish reform and the legal protection of minorities, the Disraeli government did nothing. However, the issue convulsed British politics with former Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] coming out of retirement to campaign over the atrocities. In a [[Midlothian campaign|famous campaigning speech]] he said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.attackingthedevil.co.uk/related/glad.php#sthash.1DqN5a4l.dpbs|title=Gladstone and the Bulgarian Atrocities|author=George Horton}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let the Turks now carry away their abuses, in the only possible manner, namely, by carrying off themselves. Their Zaptiehs and their Mudirs, their Blmhashis and Yuzbashis, their Kaimakams and their Pashas, one and all, bag and baggage, shall, I hope, clear out from the province that they have desolated and profaned. This thorough riddance, this most blessed deliverance, is the only reparation we can make to those heaps and heaps of dead, the violated purity alike of matron and of maiden and of child; to the civilization which has been affronted and shamed; to the laws of God, or, if you like, of Allah; to the moral sense of mankind at large.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rising Great Power tensions in the early 20th century and the interwar period led to a breakdown in the concerted will of the international community to enforce considerations of a humanitarian nature. Attempts were made under the auspices of the [[League of Nations]] to arbitrate and settle international disputes. Aggressive actions, such as the Italian [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Invasion of Abyssinia]] and the Japanese occupation of Manchuria were condemned, but the League lacked the resolve to enforce its will effectively. The Allied discovery of [[the Holocaust]] and the subsequent [[Nuremberg trials]] at the end of [[World War II]] caused attitudes to change considerably. After the tragedies in Rwanda and the Balkans in the 1990s, the international community began to  debate how to react to cases in which human rights are grossly and systematically violated. Especially, in his Millenium Report of 2000, then [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Kofi Annan]], called on Member States: "If humanitarian interention is indeed, an unacceptable assault on sovereignty, how hould we resond to a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica, to gross and systematic violation of human rights that offend every precept of our common humanity?".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/about/bgresponsibility.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the [[Cold War]], interventions have increasingly been used, such as the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] and the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]]. 

===Philosophy of humanitarian intervention===
[[File:PSM V03 D380 John Stuart Mill.jpg|thumb|[[John Stuart Mill]], an early proponent of humanitarian intervention.]]
One of the first champions of the duty of humanitarian intervention to prevent atrocities around the world, was the Victorian [[liberalism|liberal]] [[John Stuart Mill]], who wrote in his 1859 essay ''[[A Few Words on Non-Intervention]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[[John Stuart Mill]] (1859) ''[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=255&amp;search=%22A+Few+Words+On+Non-intervention%22&amp;chapter=21666&amp;layout=html#a_809352 A Few Words on Non-Intervention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106075606/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=255&amp;search=%22A+Few+Words+On+Non-intervention%22&amp;chapter=21666&amp;layout=html |date=2009-01-06 }}'' at the Online Library of Liberty&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There seems to be no little need that the whole doctrine of non-interference with foreign nations should be reconsidered, if it can be said to have as yet been considered as a really moral question at all... To go to war for an idea, if the war is aggressive, not defensive, is as criminal as to go to war for territory or revenue; for it is as little justifiable to force our ideas on other people, as to compel them to submit to our will in any other respect. But there assuredly are cases in which it is allowable to go to war, without having been ourselves attacked, or threatened with attack; and it is very important that nations should make up their minds in time, as to what these cases are... To suppose that the same international customs, and the same rules of international morality, can obtain between one civilized nation and another, and between civilized nations and [[barbarians]], is a grave error...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Mill's opinion (in 1859) barbarous peoples were found in [[Algeria]] and [[India]] where the [[French colonial empire|French]] and [[British Empire|British]] armies had been involved. Mill's justification of intervention was overt [[imperialism]]. First, he argued that with "barbarians" there is no hope for "reciprocity", an international fundamental. Second, barbarians are apt to benefit from civilized interveners, said Mill, citing Roman conquests of [[Gaul]], [[Spain]], [[Numidia]] and [[Dacia]]. Barbarians,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"have no rights as a nation, except a right to such treatment as may, at the earliest possible period, fit them for becoming one. The only moral laws for the relation between a civilized and a barbarous government, are the universal rules of morality between man and man."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While seeming wildly out of kilter with modern discourse, a similar approach can be found in theory on intervention in [[failed state]]s. Of more widespread relevance, Mill discussed the position between "civilized peoples".

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The disputed question is that of interfering in the regulation of another country’s internal concerns; the question whether a nation is justified in taking part, on either side, in the civil wars or party contests of another: and chiefly, whether it may justifiably aid the people of another country in struggling for liberty; or may impose on a country any particular government or institutions, either as being best for the country itself, or as necessary for the security of its neighbours.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mill brushes over the situation of intervening on the side of governments who are trying to oppress an uprising of their own, saying "government which needs foreign support to enforce obedience from its own citizens, is one which ought not to exist". In the case however of a civil war, where both parties seem at fault, Mill argues that third parties are entitled to demand that the conflicts shall cease. He then moves to the more contentious situation of wars for liberation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When the contest is only with native rulers, and with such native strength as those rulers can enlist in their defence, the answer I should give to the question of the legitimacy of intervention is, as a general rule, No. The reason is, that there can seldom be anything approaching to assurance that intervention, even if successful, would be for the good of the people themselves. The only test possessing any real value, of a people’s having become fit for popular institutions, is that they, or a sufficient portion of them to prevail in the contest, are willing to brave labour and danger for their liberation. I know all that may be said, I know it may be urged that the virtues of freemen cannot be learnt in the school of slavery, and that if a people are not fit for freedom, to have any chance of becoming so they must first be free. And this would be conclusive, if the intervention recommended would really give them freedom. But the evil is, that if they have not sufficient love of liberty to be able to wrest it from merely domestic oppressors, the liberty which is bestowed on them by other hands than their own, will have nothing real, nothing permanent. No people ever was and remained free, but because it was determined to be so...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Mill's argument for humanitarian intervention, however, is not compatible with modern [[international law]]. International law after World War II establishes the principle of sovereign equality, and therefore to subject a sovereign state to outside intervention is generally considered illegal. To deal with this potential conflict between humanitarian intervention and the international legal system, there are some philosophical attempts to conciliate the two concepts and specify conditions for ethically justified interventions. [[John Rawls]], one of the most influential political philosophers of the twentieth century, offers his theory of humanitarian intervention based on the notion of "well-ordered society." According to Rawls, a well-ordered society should be peaceful and legitimate, and it must respect basic human rights. Between such well-ordered societies, the principle of non-intervention should uphold. On the other hand, expansionist or human rights violating regimes are not shielded from the international law: in grave cases such as ethnic cleansing, coercive intervention by others is legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rawls|first=John|date=Autumn 1993|title=The Law of Peoples|url=|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=20|pages=36–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martha Nussbaum]], however, is critical of Rawls' approach. She points out that the sufferings of individuals, not those of the impersonal states, form the moral foundations of humanitarian intervention. Therefore, the concept of "well-ordered society," by falsely focusing on the state rather than individuals, cannot determine whether an intervention is justified. Instead, Nussbaum proposes a more concrete standard based on human capabilities (see [[Capability approach]]). She argues that "[n]ational sovereignty should be respected, within the constraints of promoting human capabilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Frontiers of Justice: disability, nationality, species membership|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-674-01917-1|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, if a state fails to provide its citizens the basic "capabilities," such as the capability to live a healthy life, then outside intervention is justified.

Some critics contend that modern philosophical arguments for humanitarian aid fail to recognize the flaws of current international law itself. International Relations scholar [[Martha Finnemore]] argues that humanitarian crises often involve conflict between the most basic principles of international law: sovereignty, human rights and self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moral Limit and Possibility in World Politics|last=Finnemore|first=Martha|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=|editor-last=Price|editor-first=Richard|editor-link=|location=New York|pages=197–224|chapter=Paradoxes in humanitarian intervention}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, philosophical attempts to integrate all those principles into a clear ethical guideline of humanitarian intervention is deemed to be futile. Legal scholar [[Eric Posner]] also points out that countries tend to hold different views of human rights and public good, so to establish a relatively simple set of rules that reflects shared ethics is not likely to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twilight of Human Rights Law|last=Posner|first=Eric|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-931344-0|location=New York|pages=137–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal grounds==

Humanitarian intervention is a concept that can allow the use of force in a situation when the UN Security Council cannot pass a resolution under [http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-vii/index.html Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations] due to veto by a permanent member. Chapter VII allows the Security Council to take action in situations where there is a "threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression". However, any resolution to that effect must be supported by all five permanent members. The reference to the "right" of humanitarian intervention was, in the post Cold-War context for the first time invoked in 1990 by the UK delegation after Russia and China had failed to support a no-fly zone over Iraq. Therefore, in addition to humanitarian objectives the concept is designed to circumvent the UN Security Council by invoking a right. However, critics base their arguments on the 1648 treaty of Westphalia, which states the rights of sovereign nations to act freely within their own borders. This is upheld in the UN Charter of 1945, where in article 2(7) it is stated that "nothing should authorize intervention in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." Thus, because both proponents and opponents of humanitarian intervention have their legal grounds on the charter of the United Nations, there is still an ongoing controversy as to whether sovereignty or humanitarian causes should prevail. The United Nations has also continuously been involved with issues related to humanitarian intervention, with the UN intervening in an increased number of conflicts within the borders of nations.&lt;ref&gt;To protect sovereignty or to protect lives? (2008, May 15). "The Economist".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current approaches to humanitarian intervention==
Although most writers agree that humanitarian interventions should be undertaken multilaterally, ambiguity remains over which particular agents{{snd}} the UN, regional organizations, or a group of states{{snd}} should act in response to mass violations of human rights. The choice of actor has implications for overcoming collective action challenges through mobilization of political will and material resources.&lt;ref&gt;Sumon Dantiki. "Organizing for Peace: Collective Action Problems and Humanitarian Intervention." ''Journal of Military and Strategic Studies'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Questions of effectiveness, conduct and motives of the intervener, extent of internal and external support, and legal authorization have also been raised as possible criteria for evaluating the legitimacy of a potential intervener.&lt;ref name="WhoShould" /&gt;

===Pragmatic humanitarian intervention===
The most well-known standard for humanitarian intervention after World War II has been [[genocide]]. According to, the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide, the term was defined as acts “committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national ethnic, racial, or religious group.” However, the norm has been challenged. Because there is a high possibility that if the [[international community]] applies the genocide standard to undertake humanitarian intervention, it would have been too late to make a meaningful intervention which should have prevented mass homicide in the concerned country.

These two well-known standards for humanitarian intervention do not resolve the states’ trade-offs between moral responsibilities and potential costs. Furthermore, intervention without a viable plan and workable strategy could threaten the states’ obligation to their own people. It should also be considered, that sometimes humanitarian intervention only results in open-ended chaos in the country without meaningful progress.&lt;ref&gt;Pape, Robert A."When Duty Calls: A Pragmatic Standard of Humanitarian Intervention." International Security, vol. 37 no. 1, 2012, pp. 41-80. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/480536.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authorized interventions===
The understanding of what constitutes threats to international peace has been radically broadened since the 1990s to include such issues as mass displacement, and the UN Security Council has authorized use of force in situations that many states would have previously viewed as "internal" conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Lori Fisler Dmarosch ed. ''Enforcing Restraint: Collective Intervention in Internal Conflicts''. New York: Council on Foreign Relations, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unauthorized interventions===
In several instances states or groups of states have intervened with force, and without advanced authorization from the UN Security Council, at least in part in response to alleged extreme violations of basic human rights. Fairly recent examples include the [[Operation Provide Comfort|intervention after the Gulf War to protect the Kurds in northern Iraq]] as well as [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|NATO's intervention in Kosovo]].

Four distinct attitudes or approaches to the legitimacy of humanitarian intervention in the absence of Security Council authorizations can be identified:&lt;ref&gt;Jane Stromseth. "Rethinking Humanitarian Intervention: The Case for Incremental Change." ''Humanitarian Intervention: Ethical, Legal, and Political Dilemmas''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Status quo'': Categorically affirms that military intervention in response to atrocities is lawful only if authorized by the UN Security Council or if it qualifies as an exercise in the right of self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ellen O'Connell. "The UN, NATO, and International Law after Kosovo." ''Human Rights Quarterly'' 2000: pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this view, NATO's intervention in Kosovo constituted a clear violation of Article 2(4). Defenders of this position include a number of states, most notably [[Russia]] and the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;Statements by Russia and China on 24 March 1999, in UN Security Council S/PV.3988.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this approach point to the literal text of the UN Charter, and stress that the high threshold for authorization of the use of force aims to minimize its use, and promote consensus as well as stability by ensuring a basic acceptance of military action by key states. However, [[Kosovo war]] has also highlighted the drawbacks of this approach,&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Simma. "NATO, the UN and the Use of Force: Legal Aspects." ''The European Journal of International Law'' 1999: pp. 1–22&lt;/ref&gt; most notably when effective and consistent humanitarian intervention is made unlikely by the geopolitical realities of relations between the Permanent Five members of the Security Council, leading to the use of the [[veto]] and inconsistent action in the face of a [[humanitarian crises]].
#''Excusable breach'': Humanitarian intervention without a UN mandate is technically illegal under the rules of the UN Charter, but may be morally and politically justified in certain exceptional cases. Benefits of this approach include that it contemplates no new legal rules governing the use of force, but rather opens an "emergency exit" when there is a tension between the rules governing the use of force and the protection of fundamental human rights.&lt;ref name="International Affairs 1999"&gt;Danish Institute of International Affairs. ''Humanitarian Intervention: Legal and Political Aspects''. Submitted to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Denmark, December 7, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Chesterman. ''Just War or Just Peace? Humanitarian Intervention and International Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Intervening states are unlikely to be condemned as law-breakers, although they take a risk of violating rules for a purportedly higher purpose. However, in practice, this could lead to questioning the legitimacy of the legal rules themselves if they are unable to justify actions the majority of the UN Security Council views as morally and politically unjustified.
#''Customary law'': This approach involves reviewing the evolution of customary law for a legal justification of non-authorized humanitarian intervention in rare cases. This approach asks whether an emerging norm of customary law can be identified under which humanitarian intervention can be understood not only as ethically and politically justified but also as legal under the normative framework governing the use of force. However, relatively few cases exist to provide justification for the emergence of a norm, and under this approach ambiguities and differences of view about the legality of an intervention may deter states from acting. The potential for an erosion of rules governing the use of force may also be a point of concern.
#''Codification'': The fourth approach calls for the codification of a clear legal doctrine or "right" of intervention, arguing that such a doctrine could be established through some formal or codified means such as a UN Charter Amendment or UN General Assembly declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Teson. "The liberal case for humanitarian intervention." ''Humanitarian Intervention: Ethical, Legal, and Political Dilemmas''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Although states have been reluctant to advocate this approach, a number of scholars, as well as the Independent International Commission on Kosovo, have made the case for establishing such a right or doctrine with specified criteria to guide assessments of legality.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Burton. "Legalizing the Sub-Legal: A Proposal for Codifying a Doctrine of Unilateral Humanitarian Intervention." ''Georgetown Law Journal'' 1996: p. 417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Independent International Commission on Kosovo. ''Kosovo Report''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A major argument advanced for codifying this right is that it would enhance the legitimacy of international law, and resolve the tension between human rights and sovereignty principles contained in the UN charter. However, the historical record on humanitarian intervention is sufficiently ambiguous that it argues for humility regarding efforts to specify in advance the circumstances in which states can use force, without Security Council authorizations, against other states to protect human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Byers and Simon Chesterman. "Changing the Rules about Rules? Unilateral Humanitarian Intervention and the Future of International Law." ''Humanitarian Intervention: Ethical, Legal, and Political Dilemmas''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responsibility to protect===
{{Main article|Responsibility to protect}}

Although usually considered to be categorically distinct from most definitions of humanitarian intervention,&lt;ref&gt;Dorota Gierycz. "From Humanitarian Intervention to Responsibility to Protect." ''Criminal Justice Ethics'' 2010: pp. 110–128&lt;/ref&gt; the emergence of a 'Responsibility to protect' (R2P) deserves mention. Responsibility to Protect is the name of a report produced in 2001 by the [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]] (ICISS) which was established by the [[Canadian government]] in response to Kofi Annan's question of when the international community must intervene for humanitarian purposes. The Canadian government's report, "The Responsibility to Protect," found that the sovereignty not only gave a State the right to "control" its affairs, it also conferred on the State primary "responsibility" for protecting the people within its borders. Also, the report proposed that when a State fails to protect its people - either through lack of ability or a lack of willingness - the responsibility shifts to the broader international community. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/about/bgresponsibility.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The report sought to establish a set of clear guidelines for determining when intervention is appropriate, what the appropriate channels for approving an intervention are and how the intervention itself should be carried out.

Responsibility to protect seeks to establish a clearer code of conduct for humanitarian interventions and also advocates a greater reliance on non-military measures. The report also criticises and attempts to change the discourse and terminology surrounding the issue of humanitarian intervention. It argues that the notion of a 'right to intervene' is problematic and should be replaced with the 'responsibility to protect'. Under Responsibility to Protect doctrine, rather than having a right to intervene in the conduct of other states, states are said to have a responsibility to intervene and protect the citizens of another state where that other state has failed in its obligation to protect its own citizens.

This responsibility is said to involve three stages: to prevent, to react and to rebuild. Responsibility to Protect has gained strong support in some circles, such as in Canada, a handful of European and African nations, and among proponents of [[human security]], but has been criticised by others, with some Asian nations being among the chief dissenters.

* [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War|Vietnamese Intervention in Cambodia]] (1978)
* [[Uganda-Tanzania War]] (1979)
* [[Operation Provide Comfort]] ([[Iraq]], 1991)&lt;ref&gt;The UK based its legal justification for the no-flight restrictions on Iraq on humanitarian intervention.  The US based its on UN Security Council Resolution 678.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Unified Task Force]] ([[Somalia]], 1992)
* [[Operation Uphold Democracy]] ([[Haiti]], 1994)
* [[UNAMIR]] ([[Rwanda]], 1994)

* [[British military intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War]] (2000)
* [[2011 military intervention in Libya|Coalition military intervention in Libya]] (2011)
* [[Military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (2014–present)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11116792/Are-the-US-led-air-strikes-in-Syria-legal-and-what-does-it-mean-if-they-are-not.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some academics have referred to these cases as humanitarian interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Hilpold, Peter, 'Humanitarian Intervention: Is there a Need for a Legal Reappraisal?', ''European Journal of International Law'', 12 (2002), pp. 437–467&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abiew, F. K., ''The Evolution of the Doctrine and Practice of Humanitarian Intervention'', Kluwer Law International (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some cases this is only a retrospective classification of actions that were the result of a variety of motivations. Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia for instance, was justified as self-defense rather than humanitarianism and has only later come to be seen as a  possible example of humanitarian intervention.

==Proponents ==
In “[http://books.wwnorton.com/books/Can-Intervention-Work/ Can Intervention Work?]” [[Rory Stewart]], a British diplomat and politician, and Gerald Knaus, a professor and author, argue that in certain circumstances limited, but resourced interventions for a humanitarian mission can succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Can_Intervention_Work.html?id=d4yZ5ecu-q8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Can Intervention Work?|last=Stewart|first=Rory|last2=Knaus|first2=Gerald|date=2011-08-15|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=9780393081206|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors co-wrote an introduction at a moment when the international communality was debating whether and how to intervene in [[Libya]], and highlight the West’s history of imperfect interventions. They quote [[Anthony Lake]]’s policy, “to help other nation’s build themselves” as a guiding principal in foreign intervention. The authors are critical of the [[RAND Corporation]] report ''[http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2007/RAND_MG557.pdf Beginner’s Guide to Nation-Building]'' and argue every intervention situation is different based on the local political economy and there is not one universal approach that always works. The rest of the book is divided into two sections: first, Stewart reviews the international experience in [[Afghanistan]] since [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] based on his experience and travel in the country, and second, Knaus provides a case study on the international intervention in [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]]. Overall, the authors warn against “over-interventions” such as [[Iraq War|Iraq]] that were based on “exaggerated fears" and “irrational confidence” and often ignored “local tradition, identity, and history.” Stewart and Knaus advocate an intervention policy based on ““principled incrementalism” that invest time and resources in understanding local context and defining concrete goals.

==Criticism==
Many criticisms have been levied against humanitarian intervention.&lt;ref name=Mises/&gt; Inter-governmental bodies and commission reports composed by persons associated with governmental and international careers have rarely discussed the distorting selectivity of geopolitics behind humanitarian intervention nor potential hidden motivations of intervening parties. To find less veiled criticism one must usually turn to civil society perspectives, especially those shaped by independent scholars who benefit from academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Falk. "Humanitarian Intervention: Elite and Critical Perspectives." ''Global Dialogue'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that humanitarian intervention is a modern manifestation of the Western [[colonialism]] of the 19th century; the subjects of such intervention are ruled not by one sole party or entity, but by a mix of local institutions, NGOs and the interveners themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fearon|first=James D.|last2=Laitin|first2=David D.|date=2004-04-01|title=Neotrusteeship and the Problem of Weak States|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1162/0162288041588296|journal=International Security|volume=28|issue=4|pages=5–43|doi=10.1162/0162288041588296|issn=0162-2889}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne Orford]]'s work is a major contribution along these lines, demonstrating the extent to which the perils of the present for societies experiencing humanitarian catastrophes are directly attributable to the legacy of colonial rule. In the name of reconstruction, a capitalist set of constraints is imposed on a broken society that impairs its right of self-determination and prevents its leadership from adopting an approach to development that benefits the people of the country rather than makes foreign investors happy. The essence of her position is that "legal narratives" justifying humanitarian intervention have had the primary effect of sustaining "an unjust and exploitative status quo".&lt;ref&gt;Anne Orford. ''Reading Humanitarian Intervention: Human Rights and the Use of Force in International Law''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that dominant countries, especially the [[United States]] and its coalition partners, are using humanitarian pretexts to pursue otherwise unacceptable geopolitical goals and to evade the non-intervention norm and legal prohibitions on the use of international force. [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Tariq Ali]] are at the forefront of this camp, viewing professions of humanitarian motivation with deep skepticism. They argue that the United States has continued to act with its own interests in mind, with the only change being that humanitarianism has become a legitimizing ideology for projection of U.S. hegemony in a post–Cold War world. Ali in particular argues that [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|NATO intervention in Kosovo]] was conducted largely to boost [[NATO]]'s credibility.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky. ''A New Generation Draws the Line: Kosovo, East Timor, and the Standards of the West''. New York: Verso, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tariq Ali. ''Masters of the Universe? NATO's Balkan Crusade''. New York: Verso, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky’s expression of “our excess of righteousness and disinterested benevolence” is often used to describe Kennedy’s invasion of South Vietnam, which spread to all of Indochina. Furthermore, he asserts that the prospective leader of “humanitarian intervention” must uphold several qualifications. A first qualification is that the leader has to work as a [[moral agent]] that does not magnify the danger of elite culture, the efficacy of the intervention should be on the targeted population, and the people must be the moral agents that undertake humanitarian efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky. ''Humanitarian Intervention''. Boston Review: 1993-1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third type of criticism centers on the event-based and inconsistent nature of most policies on humanitarian intervention. These critics argue that there is a tendency for the concept to be invoked in the heat of action, giving the appearance of propriety for Western television viewers, but that it neglects the conflicts that are forgotten by the media or occur based on chronic distresses rather than sudden crises. [[Henry Kissinger]], for example, finds that [[Bill Clinton]]'s practice of humanitarian intervention was wildly inconsistent. The US launched two military campaigns against [[Serbia]] while ignoring more widespread [[Rwandan genocide|slaughter in Rwanda]], justifying the [[First Chechen War|Russian assault on Chechnya]], and welcoming to the United States the second-ranking military official of a widely recognized severe human rights violator - the communist government of North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kissinger. ''Does America Need a New Foreign Policy?'' New York: Simon and Schuster, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, sceptics have also argued that Humanitarian Intervention may have perverse consequences&lt;ref&gt; Kuperman, A. J. (2008) ‘The Moral Hazard of Humanitarian Intervention: Lessons from The Balkans’ International Studies Quarterly 52, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;. Castan Pinos claims that “humanitarian” interventions generate a multiplicity of collateral effects, including civilian deaths, conflict-aggravation, violence spill-over into neighbouring regions and mutual distrust between great powers&lt;ref&gt; Castan Pinos, J. (2019) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328098617_Kosovo_and_the_Collateral_Effects_of_Humanitarian_Intervention Kosovo and the Collateral Effects of Humanitarian Intervention]. Abingdon: Routledge, pp.178-182 ISBN: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328098617_Kosovo_and_the_Collateral_Effects_of_Humanitarian_Intervention 9781315148014] &lt;/ref&gt;. 

Jeremy Weinstein, a political scientist at Stanford University, has argued for "autonomous recovery": although the number of civilian deaths rises when violence between rebel groups is left unchecked, the eventual victors can develop institutions and set the terms of their rule in a self-enforcing manner. Such self-enforcement reduces the risk of a country slipping back into violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weinstein|first=Jeremy M.|date=2005-04-05|title=Autonomous Recovery and International Intervention in Comparative Perspective|ssrn=1114117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism argues that humanitarian intervention has historically consisted of primarily actions directed by so-called [[Global North|Northern states]] within the internal affairs of so-called [[Global South|Southern states]], and has also led to criticism from many non-[[Western world|Western]] states. These critics argue that the norm of non-intervention and the primacy of sovereign equality is something still cherished by the vast majority of states, which see humanitarian intervention not as a growing awareness of human rights, but a regression to the selective adherence to [[sovereignty]] of the pre–[[UN Charter]] world.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hehir. "Institutionalising Impermanence: Kosovo and the Limits of Intervention." ''Global Dialogue'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Havana [[Group of 77|G-77]] summit in 2000, the "so-called right of humanitarian intervention" as it was described, was condemned as having no basis in international law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.g77.org/summit/Declaration_G77Summit.htm Declaration of the South Summit, 10–14 April 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in his criticism, Chomsky writes that "Humanitarian interventionism goes only one way - from the powerful to the weak", and condemns what he called the targeting of the concept of national sovereignty by humanitarian interventionists, arguing that the primary purpose of national sovereignty is to give weak states partial protection against strong states, and that the protection of national sovereignty under international law stops internal conflicts in weak countries being exploited by strong ones.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky, ''A New Generation Draws the Line'', 2015 edition, page V, VI.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Islamic Financial Services Board''' (IFSB) is an international body that sets standards and offers guidance for Islamic banking and finance regulatory and supervisory agencies.&lt;ref name="IFSB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifsb.org/background.php|title=Background|website=The Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB).|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="investoped"&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic Financial Services Board - IFSB|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ifsb.asp|website=Investopedia|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], and began operations in early 2003.&lt;ref name="investoped"/&gt; {{as of|April 2017}}, it has 183 members (including full members, associate members, or observer members).&lt;ref name="IFSB" /&gt; {{As of|2017|8|2}}, the IFSB Acting Secretary-General is Zahid Ur Rehman Khokher.&lt;ref name="IFSB" /&gt; 

It was founded by "a consortium of [[central bank]]s" and the [[Islamic Development Bank]].&lt;ref name="ISRC-2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=Islamic Finance: The Regulatory Challenge|date=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VziV1eGh14kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Islamic+Financial+Services+Board&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQn-2JvbvVAhWH2YMKHTSKBpAQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Islamic%20Financial%20Services%20Board&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country of its location, Malaysia, passed a special law the year the IFSB was established -- the Islamic Financial Services Board Act 2002 -- giving the IFSB the usual "immunities and privileges" international organizations receive.&lt;ref name="DRIB-2014"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Developing Role of Islamic Banking and Finance: From Local to Global ...|date=2014|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing.|page=182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BpzDBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=%22Islamic+Financial+Services+Board%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNwMWSwrvVAhVI74MKHexpDjQ4ChDoAQhfMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Islamic%20Financial%20Services%20Board%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2005 the IFSB mandate was extended to include supervisors and regulators of insurance and securities markets.&lt;ref name="ISRC-2007"/&gt; A of 2013 the IFSB has issued 19 "Standards, Guiding Principles and Technical Note".&lt;ref name="DRIB-2014"/&gt;

The International Islamic Financial Market is a part of IFSB that standardizes Islamic capital market products and operations, though as of 2013 its recommendations were "not implemented by most Islamic banks".  It was founded in November 2001 through the cooperation of the governments and central banks of Brunei, Indonesia and Sudan. It's secretariat is located in Manama Bahrain.&lt;ref name="WIWWIE2013:309-10"&gt;[[#WIWWIE2013|Khan, ''What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?'', 2013]]: p.309-10&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one source (Faleel Jamaldeen) the Islamic Financial Services Board differs from the other Islamic financial standards organ, the AAOIFI, in that 
*the AAOIFI sets "best practices for handling the financial reporting requirements of Islamic financial institutions"; 
*IFSB standards are "mainly concerned with the identification, management, and disclosure of risk related to Islamic financial products".&lt;ref name="FJIFD2012:54"&gt;[[Sukuk#FJIFD2012|Jamaldeen, ''Islamic Finance For Dummies'', 2012]]:54&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Godiva, Countess of Mercia''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|ə|ˈ|d|aɪ|v|ə}}; died between 1066 and 1086), in [[Old English]] '''Godgifu''', was an English noblewoman who, according to a legend dating at least to the 13th century, rode naked&amp;nbsp;– covered only in her long hair&amp;nbsp;– through the streets of [[Coventry]] to gain a [[Pardon|remission]] of the oppressive [[taxation]] that her husband imposed on his tenants. The name "Peeping Tom" for a [[voyeur]] originates from later versions of this legend in which a man named Thomas watched her ride and was struck blind or dead.

== Historical figure ==

Godiva was the wife of [[Leofric, Earl of Mercia|Leofric]], Earl of [[Mercia]]. They had one known son, [[Aelfgar, Earl of Mercia|Aelfgar]].&lt;ref name=Mont&gt;Patrick W. Montague-Smith  ''Letters: Godiva's family tree'' The Times, 25 January 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The modern era [[Kingsbury family]] have claimed descent from Lady Godiva.&lt;ref name="Kingsbury Hall 2005"&gt;"Kingsbury Hall, the Genealogy of a Family" by Kenneth J. Kingsbury, Gateway Press 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  ---------- Too silly - most English people and many Americans are descended from Godiva, and millions can trace a line ---------- --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Timmins, A History of Warwickshire 1889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Smith ` Warwickshire Delineated' 1820&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Fox 'Oral and Literate Culture in England, 1500-1700' 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;P.R. Cross 'Lordship, Knighthood and Locality: A Study in English Society, C. 1180-1280' 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Godiva's name occurs in charters and the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]], though the spelling varies. The [[Old English]] name Godgifu or Godgyfu meant "gift of God"; Godiva was the [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] form. Since the name was a popular one, there are contemporaries of the same name.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Ann Williams, 'Godgifu (d. 1067?)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, October 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10873, accessed 18 April 2008] {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If she is the same Godiva who appears in the history of [[Ely Abbey]], the ''[[Liber Eliensis]]'', written at the end of the 12th century, then she was a widow when Leofric married her. Both Leofric and Godiva were generous benefactors to religious houses. In 1043 Leofric founded and endowed a [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine monastery]] at Coventry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+1226 |title=Anglo-Saxons.net, S 1226 |publisher=Anglo-saxons.net |date=13 April 1981 |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the site of a nunnery destroyed by the Danes in 1016. Writing in the 12th century, [[Roger of Wendover]] credits Godiva as the persuasive force behind this act. In the 1050s, her name is coupled with that of her husband on a grant of land to the monastery of St. Mary, [[Worcester, England|Worcester]] and the endowment of the [[minster (church)|minster]] at [[Stow Minster|Stow St Mary]], [[Lincolnshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+1232 |title=Anglo-Saxons.net, S 1232 |publisher=Anglo-saxons.net |date= |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+1478 |title=Anglo-Saxons.net, S 1478 |publisher=Anglo-saxons.net |date= |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the Stow charter, she is called "Godgife" ({{cite book| last = Thorpe| first = Benjamin| title = Diplomatarium anglicum aevi saxonici: A collection of English charters| url = https://books.google.com/?id=02dnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA320| volume = 1| year = 1865| publisher = MacMillan| page = 320| author-link = Benjamin Thorpe| place = London }})&lt;/ref&gt; She and her husband are commemorated as benefactors of other monasteries at [[Leominster]], [[Chester, England|Chester]], [[Much Wenlock]], and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Chronicle of John of Worcester'' ed. and trans. R.R. Darlington, P. McGurk and J. Bray (Clarendon Press: Oxford 1995), pp.582–583&lt;/ref&gt;  She gave Coventry a number of works in precious metal by the famous goldsmith Mannig and bequeathed a necklace valued at 100 [[Mark (money)|marks]] of silver.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Reginald Dodwell|Dodwell, C. R.]]; ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uGS7AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Anglo-Saxon Art: A New Perspective]'', 1982, Manchester UP, {{ISBN|0-7190-0926-X}} (US edn. Cornell, 1985), pp. 25 &amp; 66&lt;/ref&gt; Another necklace went to Evesham, to be hung around the figure of the Virgin accompanying the life-size gold and silver [[rood]] she and her husband gave, and [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's Cathedral]] in the [[City of London]] received a gold-fringed [[chasuble]].&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 180 &amp; 212&lt;/ref&gt;  She and her husband were among the most munificent of the several large [[Anglo-Saxon]] donors of the last decades before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]]; the early Norman bishops made short work of their gifts, carrying them off to [[Normandy]] or melting them down for bullion.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 220, 230 &amp; ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Maidstone 018.jpg|thumb|19th-century [[equestrian statue]] of the legendary ride, by [[John Thomas (sculptor)|John Thomas]], [[Maidstone Museum &amp; Art Gallery|Maidstone Museum]], Kent]]
The manor of [[Woolhope]] in [[Herefordshire]], along with four others, was given to the cathedral at [[Hereford]] before the Norman Conquest by the benefactresses [[Wulviva]] and Godiva{{spaced ndash}}usually held to be this Godiva and her sister. The church there has a 20th-century [[stained glass]] window representing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/mymuk/1097578497 |title=flickr.com |publisher=flickr.com |date=11 August 2007 |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her signature, ''Ego Godiva Comitissa diu istud desideravi'' [I, The Countess Godiva, have desired this for a long time], appears on a charter purportedly given by Thorold of Bucknall to the Benedictine [[Spalding Priory|monastery of Spalding]]. However, this charter is considered spurious by many historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+1230 |title=Anglo-Saxons.net, S 1230 |publisher=Anglo-saxons.net |date= |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, it is possible that Thorold, who appears in the Domesday Book as sheriff of Lincolnshire, was her brother. (See [[Lucy of Bolingbroke]].)

After Leofric's death in 1057, his widow lived on until sometime between the Norman Conquest of 1066 and 1086. She is mentioned in the Domesday survey as one of the few Anglo-Saxons and the only woman to remain a major landholder shortly after the conquest. By the time of this great survey in 1086, Godiva had died, but her former lands are listed, although now held by others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Katharine Keats-Rohan|K.S.B.Keats-Rohan]], ''Domesday People: A prosopography of persons occurring in English documents 1066–1166'', vol. 1: Domesday (Boydell Press: Woodbridge, Suffolk 1999), p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Godiva apparently died between 1066 and 1086.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

The place where Godiva was buried has been a matter of debate. According to the ''[[Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham]]'', or ''Evesham Chronicle'', she was buried at the Church of the Blessed Trinity at Evesham, which is no longer standing. According to the account in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', "There is no reason to doubt that she was buried with her husband at Coventry, despite the assertion of the Evesham chronicle that she lay in Holy Trinity, Evesham."&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

[[William Dugdale]] (1656) says that a window with representations of Leofric and Godiva was placed in [[Holy Trinity Church, Coventry|Trinity Church, Coventry]], about the time of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dugdale|first=William|authorlink=William Dugdale|title=Antiquities of Warwickshire|year=1656|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legend ==

The legend of the nude ride is first recorded in the 13th century, in the ''[[Flores Historiarum]]'' and the adaptation of it by [[Roger of Wendover]]. Despite its considerable age, it is not regarded as plausible by modern historians, {{citation needed|date=July 2013}} nor is it mentioned in the two centuries intervening between Godiva's death and its first appearance, while her generous donations to the church receive various mentions.

According to the typical version of the story,&lt;ref&gt;Joan Cadogan Lancaster. ''Godiva of Coventry. With a chapter on the folk tradition of the story'' by H.R. Ellis Davidson.

Lady Godiva appealed again and again to her husband, who obstinately refused to remit the tolls. At last, weary of her entreaties, he said he would grant her request if she would strip naked and ride on a horse through the streets of the town. Lady Godiva took him at his word, and after issuing a proclamation that all persons should stay indoors and shut their windows, she rode through the town, clothed only in her [[long hair]]. Just one person in the town, a tailor ever afterwards known as ''Peeping Tom'', disobeyed her proclamation in one of the most famous instances of [[voyeurism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/LadyGodiva.htm Lady Godiva], Historic-UK.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- In the story, Tom bores a hole in his shutters so that he might see Godiva pass, and is struck blind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://octavia.net/the-truth-about-lady-godiva/ "The Historical Godiva"], Octavia Randolph&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Godiva's husband keeps his word and abolishes the onerous taxes.THIS OCTAVIA SOURCE IS NOT A RELIABLE ONE.

[[File:Leighton-Lady Godiva.jpg|thumb|left|''Lady Godiva'': [[Edmund Blair Leighton]] depicts the moment of decision (1892)]]
Other attempts to find a more plausible rationale for the legend include one based on the custom at the time for penitents to make a public procession in their [[Chemise|shift]], a sleeveless white garment similar to a [[Slip (clothing)|slip]] today and one which was certainly considered "underwear". Thus Godiva might have actually travelled through town as a penitent, in her shift. Godiva's story could have passed into folk history to be recorded in a romanticised version. Another theory has it that Lady Godiva's "nakedness" might refer to her riding through the streets stripped of her jewellery, the trademark of her [[upper class]] rank. However, these attempts to reconcile known facts with legend are both weak; in the era of the earliest accounts, the word "naked" is only known to mean "without any clothing whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/1507606.stm |title=The Naked Truth |publisher=BBC News |date=24 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modified version of the story was given by printer [[Richard Grafton]], later elected [[Elizabeth I's first parliament|MP for Coventry]]. According to his ''Chronicle of England'' (1569), "Leofricus" had already exempted the people of Coventry from "any maner of Tolle, Except onely of Horses", so that Godiva ("Godina" in text) had agreed to the naked ride just to win relief for this horse tax. And as a condition, she required the officials of Coventry to forbid the populace "upon a great pain" from watching her, and to shut themselves in and shutter all windows on the day of her ride.&lt;ref name=grafton&gt;{{Harvnb|Grafton|1809}}, volume 1, p.148. {{cite book| last = Grafton| first = Richard| title = Grafton's chronicle, or history of England: to which is added his table of the bailiffs, sheriffs and mayors of the city of London from the year 1189, to 1558, inclusive : in two volumes| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wr4_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA148| volume = 1| year = 1809| publisher = P.

[[File:Peeping Tom effigy Coventry-Gentlemans Magazine-vol96(1826)-p20.png|thumb|Wooden statue of Peeping Tom exhibited for the Coventry parade. Sketch by W. Reader (from an 1826 article)]]

The story of Peeping Tom, who alone among the townsfolk spied on the Lady Godiva's naked ride, probably did not originate in literature, but came about through popular lore in the locality of Coventry. Reference by 17th-century chroniclers has been claimed,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; but all the published accounts are 18th-century or later.

According to an 1826 article submitted by someone well-versed in local history and identifying himself as W. Reader,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=W. |last=Reader|title=Peeping Tom of Coventry and Lady Godiva|page=20 |magazine=The Gentleman's Magazine |volume=96|year=1826|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6hJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA20|ref=harv }}, ib., "Show Fair at Coventry described". p.22- (with a sketch of Peeping Tom wooden statue)&lt;/ref&gt; there was already a well-established tradition that there was a certain tailor who had spied on Lady Godiva, and that at the annual Trinity Great Fair (now called the [[Godiva Festival]]) featuring the [[Godiva Procession|Godiva processions]] "a grotesque figure called Peeping Tom" would be set on display, and it was a wooden statue carved from oak. The author has dated this [[effigy]], based on the style of armour he is shown wearing, from the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (d. 1685). The same writer felt the legend had to be subsequent to [[William Dugdale]] (d. 1686) since he made no mention of it in his works that discussed Coventry at full length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reader|1826|p=22}} "yet no one, including the late Sir W. Dugdale, even hints at the circumstance in question. We may safely, therefore, appropriate it to the reign of Charles II".&lt;/ref&gt; (The story of the tailor and the use of a wooden effigy may be as old as the 17th century, but the effigy may not have always been called "Tom". See 1773 date below, and the alternate suggested name "Action".)

W. Reader dates the first Godiva procession to 1677,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reader|1826|p=22}} "In 1677{{nbsp}}... the Procession at the great Fair was first instituted."&lt;/ref&gt; but other sources date the first parade to 1678, and on that year a lad from the household of James Swinnerton enacted the role of Lady Godiva.&lt;ref&gt;Hartland, E. Sydney, ''Science of Fairy Tales'', (1890), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fgniX8PvfG4C&amp;pg=PA75 p.75], taken down from the Annals of Coventry, ms. D:"31 May 1678, being the great Fair at Coventry.. and Ja. Swinnertons Son represented Lady Godiva"&lt;/ref&gt;

The English ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (''D.N.B.'') gives a meticulous account of the literary sources.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{Harvnb|DNB|1890}}, "That one person disobeyed the order{{nbsp}}... first stated by Rapin (1732){{nbsp}}... Pennant (Journey from Chester to London)(1782) calls him 'a certain taylor.'  The name 'peeping Tom' occurs in the city accounts on 11 June 1773 when a new wig and fresh paint were supplied for his effigy."&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Paul de Rapin]] (1732) reported the Coventry lore that Lady Godiva performed her ride while "commanding all Persons to keep within Doors and from their Windows, on pain of Death" but one man could not refrain from looking and it "cost him his life"; Rapin further reported that the town commemorates this with a "Statue of a Man looking out of a Window."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1 = Paul M. Rapin de Thoyras| author2 =  N. Tindal Thomas (tr.)| title = The History of England| url = https://books.google.com/?id=pHJZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA135| edition = 2nd| volume = 1| year = 1732| publisher = J., J. and P. Knapton| page = 135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, [[Thomas Pennant]] in ''Journey from Chester to London'' (1782) recounted how "the curiosity of a certain taylor overcoming his fear, he took a single peep".&lt;ref name=pennant/&gt; Pennant noted that the person enacting Godiva in the procession was not fully naked of course, but wore "silk, closely fitted to her limbs", which had a colour resembling the skin's complexion.&lt;ref name=pennant&gt;Pennant, Thomas, ''The Journey from Chester to London'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=ii82AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA190 1811 edition, p.190]&lt;/ref&gt; (In Chester's time around 1782 silk was worn, but the annotator of the 1811 edition noted that a cotton garment had since replaced the silk fabric.&lt;ref name=pennant/&gt;) According to the ''D.N.B.'', the oldest document that mentions "Peeping Tom" by name is a record in Coventry's official annals, dating to 11 June 1773, documenting that the city issued a new wig and paint for the wooden effigy.

There is also said to be a letter from pre-1700, stating that the peeper was actually Action (pronounced Actæon?), Lady Godiva's groom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|DNB|1890}}, "Poole quotes from the 'Gentleman's Magazine' a letter from Canon Seward (ca. before 1700) which makes the peeper 'a groom of the countess,' named Action (?Actæon - same name as the figure in Greek mythology who was put to death by being hunted with hounds after seeing the goddess Artemis in her bath)".&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional legend proclaims that Peeping Tom was later struck blind as heavenly punishment, or that the townspeople took the matter in their own hands and blinded him.&lt;ref&gt;Leman Rede, "Peeping Tom", The New Monthly Magazine and Humorist, (1838), Part the First, p. 115: "Tradition adds, that the people resolved to close up their houses{{nbsp}}... but{{nbsp}}... that one, whose name has not survived, looked forth upon her, and was stricken blind, as some affirm, by the vengeance of Heaven; or, according to others, was deprived of sight by the inhabitants." (A quote from a source merely identified as "a modern writer".)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Lady Godiva Clock in Coventry, England.jpg|thumb|alt=|The Lady Godiva Clock in Coventry displays her naked ride through the city and Peeping Tom's voyeurism]] 
The [[Herbert Art Gallery and Museum]] in Coventry maintains a permanent exhibition on the subject. The oldest painting was commissioned by the [[County of the City of Coventry]] in 1586 and produced by [[Adam van Noort]], a refugee Flemish artist. His painting depicts a "voluptuously displayed" Lady Godiva against the background of a "fantastical Italianate Coventry". In addition the Gallery has collected many Victorian interpretations of the subject described by [[Marina Warner]] as "an oddly composed [[Edwin Henry Landseer|Landseer]], a swooning [[George Frederic Watts|Watts]] and a sumptuous [[Alfred Woolmer]]".&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

[[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]]'s ''[[Lady Godiva (painting)|Lady Godiva]]'' was bequeathed by social reformer [[Thomas Hancock Nunn]]. When he died in 1937, the [[Pre-Raphaelite]]-style painting was offered to the [[Corporation of Hampstead]]. He specified in his will that should his bequest be refused by Hampstead (presumably on grounds of propriety) the painting was then to be offered to Coventry. The painting now hangs in the [[Herbert Art Gallery and Museum]].&lt;ref name="Mont"/&gt;

American sculptor [[Anne Whitney]] created a marble sculpture of Lady Godiva, now in the collection of the Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SIRIS - Smithsonian Institution Research Information System|url = http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=X43788H3E8402.263269&amp;menu=search&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;npp=50&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;profile=ariall&amp;ri=&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;term=godiva&amp;index=.GW&amp;x=14&amp;y=10&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;term=Anne+Whitney&amp;index=.AW&amp;term=&amp;index=.TW&amp;term=&amp;index=.SW&amp;term=&amp;index=.FW&amp;term=&amp;index=.OW&amp;term=&amp;index=.NW|website = siris-artinventories.si.edu|accessdate = 26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]] recorded the song "[[Lady Godiva (song)|Lady Godiva]]" for his 1966 album ''My Way''.  The duo [[Peter and Gordon]] recorded a cover version the same year, which became a Top 10 single in the US.

The New York-based rock group [[The Velvet Underground]] recorded the song "[[Lady Godiva's Operation]]" for their 1968 album ''[[White Light/White Heat]]''.

[[Dr. Hook &amp; The Medicine Show]] recorded a song, "Hey, Lady Godiva!" written by [[Shel Silverstein]]. The song addressed Godiva directly and contained the chorus, "Don't know much about horses, but you sure picked a funny way to ride 'em."

Extreme metal band [[Heaven Shall Burn]] used the legend of Lady Godiva for the song "Godiva" from their 2013 album ''[[Veto (album)|Veto]]''.

The band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] references Godiva in their song "[[Don't Stop Me Now]]" with the lyric, “I’m a racing car, passing by like Lady Godiva.”

Battle Rapper [[Bonnie Godiva]] created her stage name from a combination of the names of Lady Godiva and [[Bonnie and Clyde|Bonnie Elizabeth Parker]].

In the second episode of [[Charmed (season 7)|season 7 of the television show Charmed]], titled "The Bare Witch Project", the main characters meet Lady Godiva and protect her from an evil baron.

==History==
Linklaters was founded in London in 1838 when John Linklater entered into a partnership with Julius Dods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/linklaters/docs/linklaters_history_passing_the_flame?e=2011527/2493991|title=Passing the Flame|accessdate=15 June 2013|publisher=Linklaters and GM Toucari|year=2013|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm, initially known as Dods &amp; Linklater, developed a practice in [[corporate law]], including advising on the creation of the [[Metropolitan Water Board (London)|Metropolitan Water Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/linklaters/docs/linklaters_history_passing_the_flame?e=2011527/2493991|title=Passing the Flame|accessdate=15 June 2013|publisher=Linklaters and GM Toucari|year=2013|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 May 1920, the firm, then known as Linklater &amp; Co, merged with another renowned London firm, Paines Plythe &amp; Huxtable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/linklaters/docs/linklaters_history_passing_the_flame?e=2011527/2493991|title=Passing the Flame|accessdate=15 June 2013|publisher=Linklaters and GM Toucari|year=2013|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been founded by a descendant of [[Thomas Paine]].

For most of the twentieth century, Linklaters &amp; Paines was predominately a domestic corporate law firm, with only a small number of overseas offices. However, in 1998, Linklaters &amp; Alliance was created in partnership with many of [[Europe]]'s leading law firms, including [[De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek]] in [[Amsterdam]], De Bandt van Hecke Lagae in [[Brussels]], Loesch &amp; Wolter in [[Luxembourg]], Lagerlöf &amp; Leman in [[Stockholm]] and Oppenhoff &amp; Rädler in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/linklaters/docs/linklaters_history_passing_the_flame?e=2011527/2493991|title=Passing the Flame|accessdate=15 June 2013|publisher=Linklaters and GM Toucari|year=2013|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/law-the-firm-that-wants-to-conquer-the-world-1173075.html|title=Law: The firm that wants to conquer the world|accessdate=15 June 2013|publisher=The Independent|date=21 August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next five years, Linklaters &amp; Paines merged with the last four of these Alliance firms, as well as several other European firms, in [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], [[Czech Republic]] and [[Poland]]. The firm opened new offices in [[Amsterdam]], [[Bangkok]], [[Beijing]], [[Budapest]], [[Bucharest]], [[Bratislava]], [[Lisbon]], [[Madrid]], [[Milan]], [[Rome]], [[São Paulo]], and [[Shanghai]]. In 1999, amid this global expansion, the firm shortened its name to Linklaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/linklaters/docs/linklaters_history_passing_the_flame?e=2011527/2493991|title=Passing the Flame|accessdate=15 June 2013|publisher=Linklaters and GM Toucari|year=2013|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 2005, after Japan enacted laws to allow certain international law firms to open offices in the country, Linklaters created Japan’s first fully merged law firm practising Japanese, English and US law. Linklaters spun off its offices in Bratislava, Bucharest, Budapest and Prague into a separate firm, [[Kinstellar]] (an [[anagram]] of Linklaters) in 2007. In the aftermath of the credit crunch in 2008, Linklaters cut 270 jobs in London, consisting of around 120 lawyers and 150 other staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelawyer.com/linklaters-270-london-jobs-to-go/136509.article|title=Linklaters: 270 London jobs to go|publisher=The Lawyer|date=2009-01-29|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was reported to be part of managing partner Simon Davies' plan to become a smaller, more profitable organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelawyer.com/exclusive-linklaters-to-axe-up-to-70-partners-in-massive-shake-up/136424.article|title=Linklaters to axe up to 70 partners in massive shake-up|publisher=The Lawyer|date=2009-01-23|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 2012, Linklaters entered into an alliance with [[Big Six (law firms)|top-tier]] Australian law firm [[Allens (law firm)|Allens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-22/aar-linklaters-agree-on-alliance-to-compete-internationally.html|title=AAR, Linklaters Agree on Alliance to Compete Internationally|accessdate=15 June 2013|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allens and Linklaters operate two joint ventures in Asia: one focused on energy, resources and infrastructure services, and another on Indonesia in collaboration with domestic firm Widyawan &amp; Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allens.com.au/allensandlinklaters/index.htm|publisher=Allens|title=Allens and Linklaters form integrated alliance|accessdate=15 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520030717/http://www.allens.com.au/allensandlinklaters/index.htm|archivedate=20 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 February 2013, the firm entered into an alliance with leading South African law firm [[Webber Wentzel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webberwentzel.com/wwb/content/en/ww/ww-press-releases?oid=38296&amp;sn=Detail-2011&amp;pid=32711|publisher=Webber Wentzel|title=Webber Wentzel to form alliance with leading global firm|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is very active in China.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thelawyer.com/linklaters-china-strategy/ "Linklaters: We will succeed in China where others have failed"], The Lawyer, Rachel Moloney, October 9, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Linklaters also has a best-friend arrangement with Talwar Thakore &amp; Associates, a leading Indian law firm.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magiclawyers.com/TalwarThakoreAssociates.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Linklaters' Paris practice, which consists of 30 partners, in November 2017 lost several partners including partner [[David Swinburne]] to the firm [[Jones Day]]. Earlier that year, the Paris office also lost Kiril Bougartchev and Emmanuel Moyne, who spun off to form [[Bougartchev Moyne Associés|their own firm]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thelawyer.com/jones-day-linklaters-paris/ "Jones Day hires three-lawyer Linklaters team in Paris"], The Lawyer, Rachel Moloney, November 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The firm then hired Tom Alabaster from [[Latham &amp; Watkins]] in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thelawyer.com/latham-carlyle-linklaters/ "Latham loses former Carlyle in-houser to Linklaters"], The Lawyer, Rachel Moloney, October 18, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Then it hired a team from [[Mayer Brown]] in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thelawyer.com/linklaters-boosts-new-york-mayer-brown-team-hire/ "Linklaters boosts New York with Mayer Brown team hire"], The Lawyer, Natasha Bernal, October 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macedonian nationality law''' is governed by the [[Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia]] (article 4) of 1991 and the Law on Citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: Закон за државјанството на Република Македонија) of 1992 (with changes made in various years through to 2008).
Macedonian citizenship is based primarily on the principle of [[Jus sanguinis]]. In other words, one usually acquires Macedonian citizenship if a parent is [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]], irrespective of place of birth.

==Citizenship by Constitution==
According to the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia:

''"Citizens of the Republic of Macedonia have citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia. A subject of the Republic of Macedonia may neither be deprived of citizenship, nor expelled or extradited to another state. Citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia is regulated by law."''

==Acquisition of Citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia==
Citizenship of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] is acquired by:
*1) Origin
*2) Birth in the territory of the Republic of Macedonia
*3) Naturalization

===By Origin===
A child acquires citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia by origin if:
*1) At the time of her/his birth both parents are nationals of the [[Republic of Macedonia]];
*2) At the time of her/his birth one of the parents is a national of the Republic of Macedonia, while the child is born in the Republic of Macedonia, if the parents have not determined by mutual consent that the child acquires citizenship of the other parent and
*3) At the time of her/his birth one of the parents is a national of the Republic of Macedonia, while the other parent is unknown or holds unknown citizenship, or respectively she/he is stateless, and the child is born abroad.

An adopted child acquires also citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia by origin in the case of full adoption when both of her/his adoptive parents are nationals of the Republic of Macedonia or when one of her/his adoptive parents is a national of the Republic of Macedonia.

==== Child born abroad by Macedonian parent ====
A child born abroad one of whose parents at the time of her/his birth is a national of the Republic of Macedonia while the other is a foreign national, acquires citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia by origin if she/he has been reported for registration as a national of the Republic of Macedonia before reaching 18 years of age or if before reaching 18 years of age she/he has settled permanently in the Republic of Macedonia together with her/his parent who is a national of the Republic of Macedonia. In the case of a lawsuit over the custody of a child, the citizenship shall be acquired after the court decision has gone into effect.

Citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia may be acquired under the requirements of paragraph 1 of this Article by a person who has not been reported by both parents and who has reached 18 years of age, if she/he submits an application for registration in the citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia before reaching 23 years of age.

The application of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article is submitted to the body competent for keeping the registries in which the birth of the child is additionally registered or to a diplomatic-consular mission of the Republic of Macedonia abroad. The child who acquires citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia in the sense of Article 4 of this law and paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article is considered a national of the Republic of Macedonia from the moment of her/his birth.

===By Birth in the Territory of the Republic of Macedonia===
Citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia is acquired by a child who is found or born in the territory of the Republic of Macedonia whose parents are unknown, or with unknown citizenship or without citizenship.

The citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia of the child of paragraph 1 of this Article shall cease if it has been established that her/his parents are foreign nationals before she/he has reached 15 years of age.

===By Naturalization===
An alien who has submitted an application for admission into citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia may acquire citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia by naturalization, if he fulfils the following requirements:

*1) To have reached 18 years of age;
*2) Until the submission of the application to have been legally and continuously residing in the territory of the Republic of Macedonia for at least 8 years;
*3) To have a residence and a permanent source of funds for existence to the level that provides material and social security under conditions determined by law;
*4) Is not punished with imprisonment of at least one year in Republic of Macedonia and the country of his original nationality,
*5) There should be no criminal proceedings instigated against him in the state of his nationality or in the Republic of Macedonia;;
*6) Knowledge of the Macedonian language, to the extent that it can easily be understand by the community;
*7) The applicant isn't prohibited to reside in the Republic of Macedonia;
*8) His admission to citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia does not threaten the security and defense of the Republic of Macedonia;
*9) To sign an oath that will be a loyal citizen of the Republic Macedonia
*10) To have a release from his foreign citizenship or a proof that he will obtain a release if he is admitted into the citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia.

==Loss of citizenship==
Citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia could be lost by self revocation or could be revoked by the Macedonian government.

==Dual citizenship==
Macedonia allows its citizens to hold foreign citizenship in addition to their Macedonian citizenship. Some countries, however, do not permit multiple citizenship e.g. adults who acquired Macedonian and [[Japanese citizenship]] by birth must declare, to the latter's [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]], before turning 22, which citizenship they want to keep.

==Visa requirements==
{{main|Visa requirements for Macedonian citizens}}
[[File:Visa requirements for Macedonian citizens.png|thumbnail|400px|right|Visa requirements for Macedonian citizens]]
In 2015, Macedonian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 107 countries and territories, ranking the [[Macedonian passport]] 46th in the world according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa Restrictions Index|Visa Restrictions Index]].

[[File:Amak Island, Steller's Sea Lion haul out.jpg|thumb|One species of marine mammal: the [[Steller sea lion]] - this haul rests on rocks located on [[Amak Island]].]]
The '''Marine Mammal Protection Act''' ('''MMPA''') was the first [[act of Congress|act]] of the [[United States Congress]] to call specifically for an ecosystem approach to wildlife management. It was signed into law on October 21, 1972 by President Richard Nixon and took effect 60 days later on December 21, 1972. MMPA prohibits the "taking" of [[marine mammal]]s, and enacts a moratorium on the import, export, and sale of any marine mammal, along with any marine mammal part or product within the [[United States]].  The Act defines "take" as "the act of [[hunting]], killing, capture, and/or harassment of any marine mammal; or, the attempt at such." The MMPA defines harassment as "any act of pursuit, torment or annoyance which has the potential to either: a. injure a marine mammal in the wild, or b. disturb a marine mammal by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, which includes, but is not limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering." The MMPA provides for enforcement of its prohibitions, and for the issuance of regulations to implement its legislative goals.

== Marine mammal management ==
Authority to manage the MMPA was divided between the [[United States Department of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] through the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] (Service), and the [[United States Department of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]], which is delegated to the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).  Subsequently, a third Federal agency, the Marine Mammal Commission (MMC), was established to review existing policies and make recommendations to the Service and the NOAA better implement the MMPA.  Coordination between these three Federal agencies is necessary in order to provide the best management practices for marine mammals.

Under the MMPA, the Service is responsible for ensuring the protection of [[sea otter]]s and marine otters, [[walrus]]es, [[polar bear]]s, three species of [[manatee]]s, and [[dugong]]s.  NOAA was given responsibility to conserve and manage [[pinniped]]s including [[Phocidae|seals]] and [[sea lion]]s and [[cetacean]]s such as [[whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s.

== Marine mammal permits and international coordination ==
The MMPA prohibits the take and exploitation of any marine mammal without appropriate authorization, which may only be given by the Service.  Permits may be issued for scientific research, public display, and the importation/exportation of marine mammal parts and products upon determination by the Service that the issuance is consistent with the MMPA’s regulations. The two types of permits issued by the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]]'s Office of Protected Resources are incidental and directed. Incidental permits, which allow for some unintentional taking of small numbers of marine mammal, are granted to U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity other than commercial fishing in a specified geographic area. Directed permits are required for any proposed marine mammal scientific research activity that involves taking marine mammals.

Applications for such permits are reviewed and issued the Service's Division of Management Authority, through the International Affairs office.  This office also houses the Division of International Conservation, which is directly responsible for coordinating international activities for marine mammal species found in both U.S. and International waters, or are absent from U.S. waters.  Marine mammal species inhabiting both U.S. and International waters include the West Indian manatee, sea otter, polar bear, and Pacific walrus.  Species not present in U.S. waters include the West African and Amazonian manatee, dugong, Atlantic walrus, and marine otter.

== Marine mammal conservation in the field ==
In efforts to conserve and manage marine mammal species, the Service has appointed field staff dedicated to working with partners to conduct population censuses, assess population health, develop and implement conservation plans, promulgate regulations, and create cooperative relationships internationally.

Various Marine Mammal Management offices are located on either coast.  The Service's Marine Mammal Management office in [[Anchorage, Alaska]] is responsible for the management and conservation of [[polar bear]]s, [[Pacific walrus]]es, and [[northern sea otter]]s in Alaska.  Northern sea otters present in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]] are managed by the Western Washington Field Office, while [[southern sea otter]]s residing in [[California]] are managed by the Ventura Field Office.  West Indian manatee populations extend from [[Texas]] to [[Rhode Island]], and are also present in the [[Caribbean Sea]]; however, this species is most prevalent near [[Florida]] (the Florida subspecies) and [[Puerto Rico]] (the Antillean subspecies).  The Service’s Jacksonville Field Office manages the Florida manatee, while the Boqueron Field Office manages the Antillean manatee.

The polar bear, southern sea otter, marine otter, all three species of manatees, and the dugong are also concurrently listed under the [[Endangered Species Act]] (ESA).

== Amendments ==
'''Amendments enacted in 1981''' established conditions for permits to be granted to take marine mammals "incidentally" in the course of commercial fishing. In addition, the amendments provided additional conditions and procedures for transferring management authority to the States, and authorized appropriations through FY 1984.

'''Policies created in 1982'''
 
* Some marine mammal species or stocks may be in danger of extinction or depletion as a result of human activities. 
* These species or stocks must not be permitted to fall below their optimum sustainable population level (depleted) 
* Measures should be taken to replenish these species or stocks 
* There is inadequate knowledge of the ecology and population dynamics 
* Marine mammals have proven to be resources of great international significance.

The '''1984 amendments''' established conditions to be satisfied as a basis for importing fish and fish products from nations engaged in harvesting [[yellowfin tuna]] with [[Seine fishing|purse seines]] and other commercial fishing technology, as well as authorized appropriations for agency activities through FY 1988.

'''Amended in 1988'''

* the establishment of conditions and procedures for the Secretaries of Commerce and Interior to review the status of populations to determine if they should be listed as "depleted" (below optimal, sustainable population numbers or listed as threatened or endangered);
* the preparation of conservation plans for any species listed as depleted, including a requirement that such plans be modeled after recovery plans developed pursuant to the Endangered Species Act;
* the listing of conditions under which permits may be issued to take marine mammals for the protection and welfare of the animals, including importation, public display, scientific research, and enhancing the survival or recovery of a species; and
* a reward system under which the Secretary of the Treasury can pay up to $2500 to individuals providing information leading to convictions for violations of the Act.

'''Amended in 1995'''

* Certain exceptions to the take prohibitions, such as for [[Alaska Natives|Alaska Native]] subsistence and permits and authorizations for scientific research; 
* A program to authorize and control the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations; 
* Preparation of stock assessments for all marine mammal stocks in waters under U.S. jurisdiction; and 
* Studies of pinniped-fishery interactions.

==Findings==
Congress found that: all species and population stocks of marine mammals are, or may be, in danger of extinction or depletion due to human activities; these mammals should not be permitted to diminish below their optimum sustainable population; measures should be taken immediately to replenish any of these mammals that have diminished below that level, and efforts should be made to protect essential habitats; there is inadequate knowledge of the ecology and population dynamics of these mammals; negotiations should be undertaken immediately to encourage international arrangements for research and conservation of these mammals. Congress declared that marine mammals are resources of great international significance (aesthetic, recreational and economic), and should be protected and encouraged to develop to the greatest extent feasible commensurate with sound policies of resource management. The primary management objective should be to maintain the health and stability of the marine ecosystem. The goal is to obtain an optimum sustainable population within the carrying capacity of the habitat.

&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;The '''Metropolitan Police Act''' was a [[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1920–1939|1933]] [[Act of Parliament]] initiated by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It was largely the brainchild of [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Hugh Trenchard]], who served as [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Police Commissioner]] from 1931 to 1935. He instigated changes for the improvement of police residences known as section houses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.met.police.uk/history/timeline1930-1949.htm |title=Time Line 1930 - 1949 |accessdate=2008-06-08 |work=Metropolitan Police Web Site |publisher=Metropolitan Police |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020602095700/http://www.met.police.uk/history/timeline1930-1949.htm |archivedate=2002-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; following various reports instigated during 1932. The report proposed sweeping changes and indirectly called into question the reliability of the police in a major emergency.  After adverse reactions in the press and questions in Parliament, the Home Secretary [[Sir John Gilmour, 2nd Baronet|Sir John Gilmour]] stated that Trenchard's report would be published as a White Paper, giving MPs an opportunity to debate the issues. In very quick order the White Paper was turned into a Government Bill.  The first two clauses of the Bill, which proposed to increase the number of assistant commissioners from four to five and lower the age of retirement for senior officers, did not prove too controversial.  However, the clauses which set out limitations on membership of the [[Police Federation of England and Wales|Police Federation]] were hotly debated and characterized by left-wing politicians as "fascist".  Additionally, the proposed introduction of ten-year employment terms for some new constables was met with considerable opposition.  The bill was enacted in 1933 as the Metropolitan Police Act.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boyle62|Boyle 1962]]:pp. 630&amp;ndash;636&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Municipal wireless network''' ('''Municipal Wi-Fi''', '''Muni Wi-Fi''' or '''Muni-Fi''') is a citywide [[wireless network]]. This is usually done by providing [[municipal broadband]] via [[Wi-Fi]] to large parts or all of a municipal area by deploying a [[wireless mesh network]]. The typical deployment design uses hundreds of [[wireless access point]]s deployed outdoors, often on poles. The operator of the network acts as a [[wireless internet service provider]].

== Overview ==
[[File:Metro Wireless Node.jpg|thumb| A municipal Wi-Fi antenna in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]]]
Municipal wireless networks go far beyond the existing [[Piggybacking (internet access)|piggybacking]] opportunities available near public libraries and some coffee shops. The basic premise of carpeting an area with wireless service in urban centers is that it is more economical to the community to provide the service as a utility rather than to have individual households and businesses pay private firms for such a service. Such networks are capable of enhancing city management and public safety, especially when used directly by city employees in the field. They can also be a social service to those who cannot afford private high-speed services. When the network service is free and a small number of clients consume a majority of the available capacity, operating and regulating the network might prove difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reason.org/ps349.pdf |title=A Dynamic Perspective on Government Broadband Initiatives |accessdate=2007-08-18 |last=Ellig |first=Jerry |date=November 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=Reason Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930190341/http://www.reason.org/ps349.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muniwireless.com/|title=MuniWireless: WiFi, LTE, mobile apps, broadband|work=MuniWireless: WiFi, LTE, 4G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Verge Wireless]] formed an agreement with [[Tropos Networks]] to build a municipal wireless networks in the downtown area of [[Baton Rouge]], Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcrwireless.com/article/20030910/wi-fi/verge-wireless-to-deploy-Portland-Michigan-wi-fi-network-with-tropos-gear/]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} September 10, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Carlo MacDonald, the founder of Verge Wireless, suggested that it could provide cities a way to improve economic development and developers to build mobile applications that can make use of faster bandwidth. Verge Wireless built networks for Baton Rouge, New Orleans,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20041110005311/en/Verge-Wireless-Selects-Tropos-Networks-Gear-Unwire] Los Angeles&lt;/ref&gt; and other areas. Some applications include wireless security cameras, police mug shot software, and location-based advertising.

In 2006 the US [[Federal Trade Commission]] expressed concerns about such [[private-public partnership]]s as trending towards a [[Government-granted monopoly|franchise monopoly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2006/10/muniwireless.shtm Should Municipalities Provide Wireless Internet Service? FTC Staff Report Provides Guidance to Promote Competition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103201214/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2006/10/muniwireless.shtm |date=2007-11-03 }} October 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, some companies with existing [[cell site]]s offered high-speed wireless services where the laptop owner purchased a PC card or adapter based on [[EV-DO]] cellular data receivers or [[WiMAX]] rather than [[802.11b/g]]. A few high-end laptops at that time featured built-in support for these newer protocols. WiMAX is designed to implement a [[metropolitan area network]] (MAN) while 802.11 is designed to implement a wireless [[local area network]] (LAN).

Within the United States, providing a municipal wireless network is not recognized as a priority. Some have argued that the benefits of public approach may exceed the costs, similar to [[cable television]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Finance==
The construction of such networks is a significant part of their lifetime costs. Usually, a private firm works with local government to construct a network and operate it. Financing is usually shared by both the private firm and the municipal government. Once operational, the service may be free to users via public finance or advertising, or may be a paid service. Among deployed networks, usage as measured by number of distinct users has been shown to be moderate to light. Private firms serving multiple cities sometimes maintain an account for each user, and allow the user a limited amount of mobile service in the cities covered. As of 2007 some Muni WiFi deployments are delayed as the private and public partners negotiate the business model and financing.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.teleclick.ca/2006/06/earthlink%e2%80%99s-citywide-wi-fi-gamble-is-a-calculated-risk/ EarthLink’s Citywide Wi-Fi Gamble is a Calculated Risk] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120912013837/http://www.teleclick.ca/2006/06/earthlink%E2%80%99s-citywide-wi-fi-gamble-is-a-calculated-risk/ |date=2012-09-12 }} June 6, 2006

In such networks, radio communication is used both for the Wi-Fi service and for the "[[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul]]" or pathway to the Internet. This means that the nodes only need a wire for power (hence the habit of installing them on power and light utility poles). This "all radio" approach means that nodes must be within range of each other and form a contiguous pathway back to special aggregation nodes that have more traditional access to the Internet. Nodes then relay traffic, somewhat like a [[bucket brigade]], from the laptop to the aggregation node. This limits the way in which the network can be grown incrementally: coverage starts near the aggregation point and, as the mesh grows, new coverage can only grow out from the edge of the mesh. If a new, isolated area is to be covered, then a new aggregation point must be constructed. Private firms often take a phased approach, starting with one or a few sectors of a city to demonstrate competence before making the larger investment of attempting full coverage of a city.

[[Google WiFi]] is entirely funded by Google. Despite a failed attempt to provide citywide WiFi through a partnership with internet service provider Earthlink in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2007/08/06/san-francisco-pulls-the-plug-on-google-earthlinks-citywide-wi/ San Francisco pulls the plug on Google / Earthlink's citywide WiFi... for now] August 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the company claims that they are working to provide a wireless network for the city of San Francisco, California, although there is no specified completion date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://support.google.com/wifi/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;query=other+cities&amp;answer=44367 |title=Google Wifi: Are there plans to bring Google WiFi to any other cities? |access-date=2017-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208073219/http://support.google.com/wifi/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;query=other+cities&amp;answer=44367 |archive-date=2012-02-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other projects that are still in the planning stages have pared back their planned coverage from 100% of a municipal area to only densely commercially zoned areas. One of the most ambitious planned projects is to provide wireless service throughout [[Silicon Valley]], but the winner of the bid seems ready to request that the 40 cities involved help cover more of the cost, which has raised concerns that the project will ultimately be too slow to market to be a success. Advances in technology in 2005–2007 may allow [[wireless community network]] projects to offer a viable alternative. Such projects have an advantage in that, as they do not have to negotiate with government entities, they have no contractual obligations for coverage. A promising example is [[Meraki]]'s demonstration in San Francisco, which already claims 20,000 distinct users as of October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;

==Potential externalities==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}
Unintended [[externalities]] are possible as a result of local governments providing Internet service to their constituents. A private service provider could choose to offer limited or no service to a region if that region's largest city opted to provide free Internet service, thus eliminating the potential customer base. The private sector receives no money from taxpayers, so there isn't competition. The lack of competition prevents other municipalities in that region from benefiting from the services of the private provider.&lt;ref name="Flows"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2016/04/26/government-owned-internet-failure/#2abdc05f5137|title=The Failures Of Government-Owned Internet|last=Flows|first=Capital|access-date=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller public municipalities would at the same time not benefit from the free service provided by the larger city because it is designed to be subsidized by taxpayers and not concerned about the maximization of profits. The broadband provided by the government isn't largely supported to create an income on top of the private sector not being competed with enough to make a profit. Thus, making both municipal wireless networks anticompetitive.&lt;ref name="Flows"/&gt;

Overuse could be another issue. If usage of the publicly provided network became heavier than existing private options network overload issues could arise, forcing the municipality to invest more heavily, thus spending more revenue, on infrastructure to maintain the existing level of service. This issue could be compounded if private providers begin exiting a market as mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://watchdog.org/267073/government-broadband-report/|title=Report: Government broadband should be a 'last resort' - Watchdog.org|date=2016-06-06|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6234">The '''Native American Rights Fund''' ('''NARF''') is a non-profit organization that uses existing laws and treaties to ensure that [[U.S. state]] governments and the [[U.S. federal government]] live up to their legal obligations. NARF also "provides legal representation and technical assistance to Indian tribes, organizations and individuals nationwide."&lt;ref name=NARF&gt;[http://www.narf.org/ Native American Rights Fund.] (retrieved on 13 Feb 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Native American Rights Fund was co-founded in 1970 by [[David Getches]] and [[John Echohawk]] ([[Pawnee people|Pawnee]]).&lt;ref name=NARF/&gt;  Echohawk  currently serves as Executive Director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unm.edu/~market/cgi-bin/archives/004750.html "UNM Today."] ''University of New Mexico''. 4 Feb 2010 (retrieved 13 Feb 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; NARF is governed by a volunteer board of directors composed of thirteen [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] from different tribes throughout the country with a variety of expertise in Indian matters. A staff of fifteen attorneys handles about fifty major cases at any given time, with most of the cases taking several years to resolve. Cases are accepted on the basis of their breadth and potential importance in setting precedents and establishing important principles of Indian law.&lt;ref name=NARF/&gt;

In September 2001 tribal Leaders met in [[Washington, D.C.]], and established the Tribal Supreme Court Project in an effort to "strengthen tribal advocacy before the U.S. Supreme Court by developing new litigation strategies and coordinating tribal legal resources."&lt;ref name=ARGH&gt;[http://www.narf.org/sct/supctproject.html "Tribal Supreme Court Project Home."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111190523/http://www.narf.org/sct/supctproject.html |date=2009-11-11 }} (retrieved on 13 Feb 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  The ultimate goal is to improve the win-loss record of Indian tribes in [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] cases. The Project is staffed by attorneys from Native American Rights Fund (NARF) and the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) and consists of a Working Group of over 200 attorneys and academics from around the nation who specialize in Indian law and other areas of law that impact Indian cases, including property law, trust law and Supreme Court practice. In addition, an Advisory Board of Tribal Leaders assists the Project by providing the necessary political and tribal perspective to the legal and academic expertise.

==Tribal Supreme Court Project==
The Tribal Supreme Court Project does the following:
*In conjunction with the National Indian Law Library, monitors Indian law cases in the state and federal appellate courts that have the potential to reach the Supreme Court (NILL Indian Law Bulletins)
*Maintains an on-line depository of briefs and opinions in all Indian law cases filed with the U.S. Supreme Court and cases being monitored in the U.S. Court of Appeal and State Supreme Courts (Court Documents)
*Prepares an Update Memorandum of Cases which provides an overview of Indian law cases pending before the U.S. Supreme Court, cases being monitored and the current work being performed by the Project
*Offers assistance to tribal leaders and their attorneys to determine whether to file a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court in cases where they lost in the court below
*Offers assistance to attorneys representing Indian tribes to prepare their Brief in Opposition at the Petition Stage in cases where they won in the court below
*Coordinates an Amicus Brief writing network and helps to develop litigation strategies at both the Petition Stage and the Merits Stage to ensure that the briefs receive the maximum attention of the Justices
*When appropriate, prepares and submits Amicus Briefs on behalf of Indian tribes and Tribal Organizations
*Provides other brief writing assistance, including reviewing and editing of the principal briefs, and the performance of additional legal research
*Coordinates and conducts Moot Court and Roundtable opportunities for attorneys who are presenting Oral Arguments before the Court
*Conducts conference calls and fosters panel discussions among attorneys nationwide about pending Indian law cases and, when necessary, forms small working groups to formulate strategy on specific issues.&lt;ref name=ARGH/&gt;

==Actions==
One of NARF's earliest cases resulted in the 1974 [[Boldt Decision]], in which a U.S. [[United States federal judge|district judge]] ruled that [[Washington (state)|Washington]] State must uphold tribal treaty rights, specifically fishing rights.&lt;ref&gt;Echohawk, John. [http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/archive/28169549.html "Echohawk: Using their law and their history to protect our rights."] 6 Jan 2006 (retrieved on 13 Feb 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

NARF has represented Native peoples in the case, ''[[Cobell v. Salazar]]'', initiated by [[Elouise Cobell]] ([[Blackfeet]]) over the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]]'s mismanagement of trust funds. The historic 13-year case resulted in a $3.4 billion settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Travis.

{{Administrative law}}

In [[English law]], '''natural justice''' is [[technical terminology]] for the rule against bias (''[[nemo iudex in causa sua]]'') and the right to a fair hearing (''[[audi alteram partem]]''). While the term ''natural justice'' is often retained as a general concept, it has largely been replaced and extended by the general "duty to act fairly".

The basis for the rule against bias is the need to maintain public confidence in the legal system. Bias can take the form of actual bias, imputed bias or apparent bias. Actual bias is very difficult to prove in practice while imputed bias, once shown, will result in a decision being void without the need for any investigation into the likelihood or suspicion of bias. Cases from different jurisdictions currently apply two tests for apparent bias: the "reasonable suspicion of bias" test and the "real likelihood of bias" test. One view that has been taken is that the differences between these two tests are largely semantic and that they operate similarly.

The right to a fair hearing requires that individuals should not be penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the case, a fair opportunity to answer it, and the opportunity to present their own case. The mere fact that a decision affects rights or interests is sufficient to subject the decision to the procedures required by natural justice. In Europe, the right to a fair hearing is guaranteed by [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights]], which is said to complement the [[common law]] rather than replace it.

==Background==
[[File:ON-CourSupreme 20090606-164356 panoramique.jpg|thumb|left|The courtroom of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]. In 1999, the Court ruled in ''[[Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)]]'' that the requirements of natural justice vary according to the context of the matter arising.]]

Natural justice is a [[technical terminology|term of art]] that denotes specific procedural rights in the [[English law|English legal system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Frederick F. Shauer|title=English Natural Justice and American Due Process: An Analytical Comparison|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmlr/vol18/iss1/3|journal=William and Mary Law Review|year=1976|volume=18|issue=1|pages=47–72 at 47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the systems of other nations based on it. It is similar to the American concepts of [[fair procedure]] and procedural [[due process]], the latter having roots that to some degree parallel the origins of natural justice.&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{citation|last=Bernard Schwartz|title=Administrative Procedure and Natural Law|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/tndl28&amp;div=11|journal=Notre Dame Lawyer|year=1953|volume=28|issue=2|page=169}}, cited in Shauer, "English Natural Justice and American Due Process", p. 51, n. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although natural justice has an impressive ancestry&lt;ref name="De Smith's Judicial Review"&gt;{{citation|author=Lord Woolf|authorlink=Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|author2=Jeffrey Jowell|author3=Andrew Le Sueur, eds.|chapter=Procedural Fairness: Introduction, History and Comparative Perspectives|title=De Smith's Judicial Review|edition=6th|location=London|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]]|year=2007|pages=317–354 at 321|isbn=978-0-421-69030-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is said to express the close relationship between the [[common law]] and moral principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Arthur L. Goodhart|authorlink=Arthur Lehman Goodhart|title=English Law and the Moral Law|url=http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/schoolofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/law/pdfs/English_Law_and_the_Moral_law.pdf|format=PDF|location=London|publisher=Stevens|year=1953|page= 65|oclc=1812603}}, cited in ''De Smith's Judicial Review'', p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; the use of the term today is not to be confused with the "[[natural law]]" of the [[canon law|Canonists]], the mediaeval philosophers' visions of an "ideal pattern of society" or the "natural rights" philosophy of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=J.R.S. Forbes|chapter=Natural Justice: General|title=Justice in Tribunals|edition=2nd|location=Sydney|publisher=The Federation Press|year=2006|pages=100–118 at 103|isbn=978-1-86287-610-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the term ''natural justice'' is often retained as a general concept, in jurisdictions such as Australia,{{r|Kioa v West|page=583|q=It has been recognized that in the context of administrative decision-making it is more appropriate to speak of a duty to act fairly or to accord procedural fairness. This is because the expression natural justice has been associated, perhaps too closely associated, with procedures followed by courts of law.}} and the United Kingdom,{{r|De Smith's Judicial Review|p=320}} it has largely been replaced and extended by the more general "duty to act fairly". Natural justice is identified with the two constituents of a fair hearing,{{r|De Smith's Judicial Review|p=322}} which are the rule against bias (''[[nemo iudex in causa sua]]'', or "no man a judge in his own cause"), and the right to a fair hearing (''[[audi alteram partem]]'', or "hear the other side").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=David Phillip Jones|author2=Anne S. de Villars|chapter=Natural Justice and the Duty to be Fair|title=Principles of Administrative Law|edition=5th|publisher=[[Carswell (publisher)|Carswell]]|year=2009|pages=208–223 at 209|isbn=978-0-7798-2126-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements of natural justice or a duty to act fairly depend on the context.{{r|Kioa v West|pages=584–585|q=What is appropriate in terms of natural justice depends on the circumstances of the case and they will include, inter alia, the nature of the inquiry, the subject-matter, and the rules under which the decision-maker is acting.}} In ''[[Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)]]'' (1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)|link=Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)|year=1999|source=CanLII|num=699|parallelcite=[1999] 2 [[Supreme Court Reports (Canada)|S.C.R.]] 817|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] set out a list of non-exhaustive factors that would influence the content of the duty of fairness, including the nature of the decision being made and the process followed in making it, the statutory scheme under which the decision-maker operates, the importance of the decision to the person challenging it, the person's [[legitimate expectation]]s, and the choice of procedure made by the decision-maker.&lt;ref&gt;''Baker'', paras. 23–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, in ''[[Knight v. Indian Head School Division No. 19]]'' (1990),&lt;ref name="Knight"&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Knight v. Indian Head School Division No. 19|link=Knight v. Indian Head School Division No. 19|year=1990|source=CanLII|num=138|parallelcite=[1990] 1 S.C.R. 653|courtname=S.C.|juris=Canada}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held that public authorities which make decisions of a legislative and general nature do not have a duty to act fairly, while those that carry out acts of a more administrative and specific nature do. Furthermore, preliminary decisions will generally not trigger the duty to act fairly, but decisions of a more final nature may have such an effect.&lt;ref name="Knight"/&gt;{{rp|para 30}} In addition, whether a duty to act fairly applies depends on the relationship between the public authority and the individual. No duty exists where the relationship is one of master and servant, or where the individual holds office at the pleasure of the authority. On the other hand, a duty to act fairly exists where the individual cannot be removed from office except for cause.&lt;ref name="Knight"/&gt;{{rp|para 32}} Finally, a right to procedural fairness only exists when an authority's decision is significant and has an important impact on the individual.&lt;ref name="Knight"/&gt;{{rp|para 39}}

==Rule against bias==

===In general===
A person is barred from deciding any case in which he or she may be, or may fairly be suspected to be, biased. This principle embodies the basic concept of impartiality,&lt;ref name=Kanda&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Surinder Singh Kanda v Federation of Malaya]] |court=UKPC|year=1962|num=2|parallelcite=[1962] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 322 at 337|courtname=auto|juris=Malaya}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and applies to courts of law, tribunals, arbitrators and all those having the duty to act judicially.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Lord Mackay of Clashfern, ed.-in-chief|authorlink=James Mackay, Baron Mackay of Clashfern|title=[[Halsbury's Laws of England]]|edition=5th|volume=61|location=London|publisher=[[LexisNexis]]|year=2010|at=para. 629|isbn=978-1-4057-3424-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A public authority has a duty to act judicially whenever it makes decisions that affect people's rights or interests, and not only when it applies some judicial-type procedure in arriving at decisions.&lt;ref&gt;See the "[[#In general 2|Right to a fair hearing]]" section below.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis on which impartiality operates is the need to maintain public confidence in the legal system. The erosion of public confidence undermines the nobility of the legal system and leads to ensuing chaos.&lt;ref name="Tang Kin Hwa"&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Tang Kin Hwa v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board|court=SGHC|year=2005|num=153|parallelcite=[2005] 4 S.L.R.(R.) [''Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)''] 604 at 610, para. 11|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The essence of the need for impartiality was observed by [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]], the [[Master of the Rolls]], in ''Metropolitan Properties Co (FGC) Ltd v Lannon'' (1968):&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Properties"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Metropolitan Properties Co (FGC) Ltd v Lannon|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1968|num=5|parallelcite=[1969] 1 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 577|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Justice must be rooted in confidence and confidence is destroyed when right-minded people go away thinking: 'The judge was biased.'"{{r|Metropolitan Properties|page=599}}

Public confidence as the basis for the rule against bias is also embodied in the often-quoted words of [[Gordon Hewart, 1st Viscount Hewart|Lord Hewart]], the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], that "[i]t is not merely of some importance, but of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly be seen to be done".&lt;ref&gt;
''[[R v Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy]]'' [1924] 1 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 256 at 259, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ([[King's Bench]]) (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forms of bias===

====Actual and imputed bias====
[[File:Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham by Charles Robert Leslie cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|A portrait of the [[Lord Chancellor]], Lord Cottenham ([[Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham]], 1781–1851), by [[Charles Robert Leslie]]. In ''[[Dimes v Grand Junction Canal]]'' (1852), his Lordship was disqualified from hearing a case as he had a pecuniary interest in the outcome.]]

Bias may be actual, imputed or apparent. Actual bias is established where it is actually established that a decision-maker was prejudiced in favour of or against a party. However, in practice, the making of such an allegation is rare as it is very hard to prove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Chee Siok Chin v. Attorney-General|court=SGHC|year=2006|num=153|parallelcite=[2006] 4 S.L.R.(R.) 541 at 547–548, para. 9|courtname=H.C.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One form of imputed bias is based on the decision-maker being a party to a suit, or having a pecuniary or proprietary interest in the outcome of the decision. Once this fact has been established, the bias is irrebuttable and disqualification is automatic – the decision-maker will be barred from adjudicating the matter without the need for any investigation into the likelihood or suspicion of bias.&lt;ref name=Dimes&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=[[Dimes v Grand Junction Canal Proprietors]] |reporter=ER|fullstops=on|year=1852|num=789|volume=10|firstpage=301|parallelcite=3 H.L. Cas. 759|courtname=[[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A classic case is ''[[Dimes v Grand Junction Canal]]'' (1852),&lt;ref name=Dimes/&gt; which involved an action between Dimes, a local landowner, and the proprietors of the [[Grand Junction Canal]], in which the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham|Lord Cottenham]], had affirmed decrees made to the proprietors. However, it was discovered by Dimes that Lord Cottenham in fact owned several pounds worth of shares in the Grand Junction Canal. This eventually led to the judge being disqualified from deciding the case. There was no inquiry as to whether a reasonable person would consider Lord Cottenham to be biased, or as to the circumstances which led Lord Cottenham to hear the case.

In certain limited situations, bias can also be imputed when the decision-maker's interest in the decision is not pecuniary but personal. This was established in the unprecedented case of ''[[R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No.2)]]'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No. 2)|link=R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No.2)|court=UKHL|year=1999|num=1|parallelcite=[2000] 1 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 119 at 133|courtname=[[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In an appeal to the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] sought to overturn a [[certiorari|quashing order]] made by the [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]] regarding [[extradition]] [[warrant (law)|warrants]] made against the ex-Chilean dictator, Senator [[Augusto Pinochet]]. [[Amnesty International]] (AI) was given leave to [[intervention (law)|intervene]] in the proceedings. However, one of the judges of the case, [[Leonard Hoffmann, Baron Hoffmann|Lord Hoffmann]], was a director and chairperson of [[Amnesty International Charity Ltd]]. (AICL), a company under the control of AI. He was eventually disqualified from the case and the outcome of the proceedings set aside. The House of Lords held that the close connection between AICL and AI presented Lord Hoffmann with an interest in the outcome of the litigation. Even though it was non-pecuniary, the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lords]] took the view that the interest was sufficient to warrant Lord Hoffmann's automatic disqualification from hearing the case. In ''Locabail (UK) Ltd v Bayfield Properties Ltd'' (1999),&lt;ref name="Locabail"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Locabail (UK) Ltd v Bayfield Properties Ltd.|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1999|num=3004|parallelcite=[2000] [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 451|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] warned against any further extension of the automatic disqualification rule, "unless plainly required to give effect to the important underlying principles upon which the rule is based".{{r|Locabail|page=465}}

====Apparent bias====
Apparent bias is present where a judge or other decision-maker is not a party to a matter and does not have an interest in its outcome, but through his or her conduct or behaviour gives rise to a suspicion that he or she is not impartial.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Pinochet'', pp. 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt; An issue that has arisen is the degree of suspicion which would provide the grounds on which a decision should be set aside for apparent bias. Currently, cases from various jurisdictions apply two different tests: "real likelihood of bias" and "reasonable suspicion of bias".

The real likelihood test centres on whether the facts, as assessed by the court, give rise to a real likelihood of bias.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Rand'' (1866) LR 1 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 230 at 233, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ([[Queen's Bench]]) (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''R v Gough'' (1993),&lt;ref name="R v Gough"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R v Gough |court=UKHL |year=1993 |num=1 |parallelcite=[1993] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 646 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords chose to state the test in terms of a "real danger of bias", and emphasized that the test was concerned with the possibility, not probability, of bias. [[Robert Goff, Baron Goff of Chieveley|Lord Goff of Chievely]] also stated that "the court should look at the matter through the eyes of a reasonable man, because the court in cases such as these personifies the reasonable man".{{r|R v Gough|page=670}} However, the test in ''Gough'' has been disapproved of in some Commonwealth jurisdictions. One criticism is that the emphasis on the court's view of the facts gives insufficient emphasis to the perception of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|30|1994|litigants=Webb v The Queen |parallelcite=(1994) 181 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 41 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms were addressed by the House of Lords in ''[[Porter v Magill]]'' (2001).&lt;ref name="Porter v Magill"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Porter v Magill |link=Porter v Magill |court=UKHL |year=2001 |num=67 |parallelcite=[2002] 2 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 357|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court adjusted the ''Gough'' test by stating it to be "whether the fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that the tribunal was biased".{{r|Porter v Magill|page=494|q=paragraph 103}} This case therefore established the current test in the UK to be one of a "real possibility of bias".

On the other hand, the reasonable suspicion test asks whether a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts would have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the litigant is not possible.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Liverpool City Justices, ex parte Topping'' [1983] 1 W.L.R. 119 at 123, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ([[Queen's Bench]]) (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; Although not currently adopted in the UK, this test has been endorsed by the [[judicial system of Singapore|Singapore courts]].&lt;ref&gt;''Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew'' [1992] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 791 at 825–826, paras. 80–83, C.A.; ''Tang Liang Hong v. Lee Kuan Yew'' [1997] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 576 at 595–596, para. 46, C.A.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the differences between the two tests are largely semantic and that the two tests operate similarly. In ''Locabail'', the judges stated that in a large proportion of the cases, application of the two tests would lead to the same outcome. It was also held that "[p]rovided that the court, personifying the reasonable man, takes an approach which is based on broad common sense, and without inappropriate reliance on special knowledge, the minutiae of court procedure or other matters outside the ken of the ordinary, reasonably well-informed members of the public, there should be no risk that the courts will not ensure both that justice is done and that it is perceived by the public to be done".{{r|Locabail|page=477|q=paragraph 17}} In the [[High Court of Singapore|Singapore High Court]] decision ''Tang Kin Hwa v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board'' (2005),&lt;ref name="Tang Kin Hwa"/&gt; [[Judicial Commissioner]] [[Andrew Phang]] observed that the real likelihood test is in reality similar to that of reasonable suspicion. First, ''likelihood'' is in fact "possibility", as opposed to the higher standard of proof centring on "probability". Secondly, he suggested that ''real'' in ''real likelihood'' cannot be taken to mean "actual", as this test relates to apparent and not actual bias. He also observed that both the court's and the public's perspectives are "integral parts of a holistic process" with no need to draw a sharp distinction between them.{{r|Tang Kin Hwa|p=617–8|q=paragraphs 39–40}}

In contrast, in ''[[Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni]]'' (2006),&lt;ref name="Shankar Alan"&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni|link=Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni|court=SGHC|year=2006|num=194|parallelcite=[2007] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 85|courtname=H.C.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Judicial Commissioner [[Sundaresh Menon]] thought that there was a real difference between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests.{{r|Shankar Alan|p=101|q=paragraph 56}} In his opinion, ''suspicion'' suggests a belief that something that may not be provable could still be possible. ''Reasonable'' suggests that the belief cannot be fanciful. Here the issue is whether it is reasonable for the one to harbour the suspicions in the circumstances even though the suspicious behaviour could be innocent. On the other hand, ''likelihood'' points towards something being likely, and ''real'' suggests that this must be substantial rather than imagined. Here, then, the inquiry is directed more towards the actor than the observer. The issue is the degree to which a particular event is not likely or possible{{r|Shankar Alan|p=99|q=paragraphs 49-50}} Menon J.C. also disagreed with both Lord Goff in ''Gough'' and Phang J.C. in ''Tang Kin Hwa'' in that he thought the shift of the inquiry from how the matter might appear to a reasonable man to whether the judge thinks there is a sufficient possibility of bias was "a very significant point of departure".{{r|Shankar Alan|p=103|q=paragraph 62}} The real likelihood test is met as long as the court is satisfied that there is a sufficient degree of possibility of bias. Although this a lower standard than satisfaction on a [[legal burden of proof#Preponderance of the evidence|balance of probabilities]], this is actually directed at mitigating the sheer difficulty of proving actual bias, especially given its insidious and often subconscious nature. The reasonable suspicion test, however, is met if the court is satisfied that a reasonable member of the public could harbour a reasonable suspicion of bias even though the court itself thought there was no real danger of this on the facts. The difference is that the driver behind this test is the strong public interest in ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice.{{r|Shankar Alan|p=107–8|q=paragraphs 74-75}} As of September 2011, the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore]] had not yet expressed a view as to whether the position taken in ''Tang Kin Hwa'' or ''Shankar Alan'' is preferable.

===Exceptions to the rule against bias===

====Necessity====
There are cases in which a disqualified adjudicator cannot be replaced, as no one else is authorized to act. It has been observed that "disqualification of an adjudicator will not be permitted to destroy the only tribunal with power to act".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Geoffrey A. Flick|title=Natural Justice: Principles and Applications|location=London|publisher=[[LexisNexis Butterworths|Butterworths]]|year=1979|pages=138–139|isbn=978-0-409-35260-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, natural justice has to give way to necessity in order to maintain the integrity of judicial and administrative systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Great Charte v Kennington|reporter=ER|fullstops=on|year=1795|num=490|volume=93|firstpage=1107|parallelcite=2 Str. 1173}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This issue regarding necessity was raised in ''Dimes''.&lt;ref name=Dimes/&gt; The Lord Chancellor had to sign an order for enrolment in order to allow the appeal to proceed from the [[Chancellor of the High Court|Vice-Chancellor]] to the House of Lords. It was held that his shareholding in the canal company which barred him from sitting in the appeal did not affect his power to enroll, as no one but him had the authority to do so. It was mentioned this was allowed "for this [was] a case of necessity, and where that occurs the objection of interest cannot prevail".{{r|Dimes|p=787|q=3 H.L. Cas. at 787, 10 E.R. at 313}}

====Waiver====
The court normally requests that an objection be taken as soon as the prejudiced party has knowledge of the bias.&lt;ref&gt;''Wakefield Local Board of Health v West Riding and Grimsby Rly. Co.'' (1865) L.R. 1 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 84, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ([[Queen's Bench]]) (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; If an objection is not raised and proceedings are allowed to continue without disapproval, it will be held that the party has waived its right to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Byles, ex parte Hollidge'' (1912) 77 J.P. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of a finding of bias===
In ''Dimes'',&lt;ref name=Dimes/&gt; the judges advised the House of Lords that Lord Cottenham's pecuniary interest made his judgment not [[void (law)|void]], but [[voidable]]. This advice is not wrong in the context of a judicial act under review, where the judgment will be held valid unless reversed on appeal.&lt;ref name="Wade &amp; Forsyth"&gt;{{citation|first1=H.W.R. |last=Wade |authorlink=Henry William Rawson Wade |first2=C.F. |last2=Forsyth|title=Administrative Law|edition=10th|location=Oxford; New York, N.Y.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|page=400|isbn=978-0-19-921973-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the cases of administrative acts or decisions under judicial review, the court can only intervene on the grounds of ''[[ultra vires]]'',{{r|Wade &amp; Forsyth|p=401}} hence making the judgment void. [[William Brett, 1st Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] said in ''Allison v General Council of Medical Education and Registration'' (1894)&lt;ref name="Allison"&gt;''Allison v General Council of Medical Education and Registration'' [1894] 1 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 750, [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]] (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; that the participation of a disqualified person "certainly rendered the decision wholly void".{{r|Allison|p=757}}

==Right to a fair hearing==

===In general===

It has been suggested that the rule requiring a fair hearing is broad enough to include the rule against bias since a fair hearing must be an unbiased hearing. However, the rules are often treated separately. It is fundamental to fair procedure that both sides should be heard.{{r|Wade &amp; Forsyth|p=402}} The right to a fair hearing requires that individuals are not penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the cases against them, a fair opportunity to answer them, and the opportunity to present their own cases.&lt;ref name="Thio"&gt;{{citation|author=Thio Li-ann|authorlink=Thio Li-ann|chapter=Law and the Administrative State|editor=Kevin Y[ew] L[ee] Tan|title=The Singapore Legal System|edition=2nd|location=Singapore|publisher=[[National University of Singapore|Singapore University Press]]|year=1999|pages=160–229 at 192–193|isbn=978-9971-69-213-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides promoting an individual's liberties, the right to a fair hearing has also been used by courts as a base on which to build up fair administrative procedures.{{r|Wade &amp; Forsyth|p=402}} It is now well established that it is not the character of the public authority that matters but the character of the power exercised.{{r|Wade &amp; Forsyth|p=405}} However, in the United Kingdom prior to ''[[Ridge v Baldwin]]'' (1963),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Ridge v Baldwin]] |court=UKHL|year=1963|num=2|parallelcite=[1964] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 40|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the scope of the right to a fair hearing was severely restricted by case law following ''Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works'' (1863).&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works|reporter=ER|fullstops=on|year=1863|num=424|volume=143|firstpage=414|parallelcite=14 C.B.N.S. 180|courtname=[[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]|juris=England}}. This was seen in cases such as ''Local Government Board v Arlidge'' [1915] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 120, [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] (UK); and ''R v Leman Street Police Station Inspector, ex parte Venicoff'' [1920] 3 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 72, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ([[Kings Bench]]) (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''R v Electricity Commissioners, ex parte London Electricity Joint Committee Co. (1920), Ltd.'' (1923),&lt;ref name="1924 1 KB 171"&gt;''R v Electricity Commissioners, ex parte London Electricity Joint Committee Co. (1920), Ltd.'' [1924] 1 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 171, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ([[Kings Bench]]) (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Atkin, Baron Atkin|Lord Atkin]] observed that the right only applied where decision-makers had "the duty to act judicially".{{r|1924 1 KB 171|p=205}} In natural justice cases this ''[[obiter dictum|dictum]]'' was generally understood to mean that a duty to act judicially was not to be inferred merely from the impact of a decision on the rights of subjects; such a duty would arise only if there was a "superadded" express obligation to follow a judicial-type procedure in arriving at the decision.{{r|De Smith's Judicial Review|p=330}}

In ''Ridge v Baldwin'', [[James Reid, Baron Reid|Lord Reid]] reviewed the authorities extensively and attacked the problem at its root by demonstrating how the term ''judicial'' had been misinterpreted as requiring some additional characteristic over and above the characteristic that the power affected some person's rights. In his view, the mere fact that the power affects rights or interests is what makes it "judicial" and so subject to the procedures required by natural justice.{{r|Wade &amp; Forsyth|p=413–5}}&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite CanLII|litigants=Nicholson v. Haldimand-Norfolk Regional Police Commissioners|link=Nicholson v. Haldimand-Norfolk Reg. Police Commrs.|year=1978|source=CanLII|num=24|parallelcite=[1979] 1 S.C.R. 311|courtname=S.C.|juris=Canada}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This removal of the earlier misconception as to the meaning of ''judicial'' is thought to have given the judiciary the flexibility it needed to intervene in cases of judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=M. Sornarajah |title=Natural Justice, Fairness and Administrative Functions|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UTasLawRw/1977/1.pdf}} (1977) 5(3) University of Tasmania Law Review 268 at 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mere fact that a decision-maker is conferred wide discretion by law is not reason enough for a weakening of the requirements of natural justice. In the United Kingdom context, this is demonstrated by ''Ahmed v H.M. Treasury (No. 1)'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Ahmed v Her Majesty's Treasury|court=UKSC|year=2010|num=2|parallelcite=[2010] 2 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 534|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] had exercised powers to freeze the appellants' financial assets and economic resources on the ground that it reasonably suspected the appellants were or might be persons who had committed, attempted to commit, participated in or facilitated the commission of terrorism, pursuant to the [[Terrorism Acts|Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Terrorism Acts|Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006]] ([[Statutory Instrument (UK)|S.I.]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/2657/contents/made 2006 No. 2657]).&lt;/ref&gt; and the Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006&lt;ref&gt;Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/2952/contents/made S.I. 2006 No. 2952]).&lt;/ref&gt; made under the [[United Nations Act 1946]].&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations Act 1946]] ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/9-10/45/contents 1946 c. 45]), s. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] held that since the Al-Qaida Order made no provision for basic procedural fairness, it effectively deprived people designated under the order the fundamental right of access to a judicial remedy and hence was ''[[ultra vires]]'' the power conferred by the United Nations Act 1946 for the making of the Order.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, ''Ahmed'', p. 685, para 246, ''per'' [[Jonathan Mance, Baron Mance|Lord Mance]] [[Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|J.S.C.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Article 6 of the European Convention===
The right to a fair hearing is also referred to in [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]], which states:&lt;ref&gt;Art. 6(3) sets out some of the requirements of the right to a fair hearing, but only in the context of criminal proceedings.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. ...}}

Article 6 does not, however, replace the common law duty to ensure a fair hearing. It has been suggested that Article 6 alone is not enough to protect procedural due process, and only with the development of a more sophisticated common law will the protection of procedural due process extend further into the administrative machine.{{r|Wade &amp; Forsyth|p=405}} Nonetheless, Article 6 supplements the common law. For example, the common law does not impose a general duty to give reasons for a decision, but under Article 6(1) a decision-maker must give a reasoned judgment so as to enable an affected individual to decide whether to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Hadjianastassiou v Greece|court=ECHR|year=1992|num=78|parallelcite=(1992) 16 E.H.R.R. 219|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aspects of a fair hearing===

====Prior notice of hearing====
Natural justice allows a person to claim the right to adequate notification of the date, time, place of the hearing as well as detailed notification of the case to be met.&lt;ref name="Thio"/&gt; This information allows the person adequate time to effectively prepare his or her own case and to answer the case against him or her. In ''Cooper v Wandsworth'',&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt; [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas|Chief Justice]] [[William Erle]] went so far as to state that the lack of notice and hearing afforded to Cooper could be said to be a form of abuse, as he had been treated as if he did not matter.&lt;ref name="Endicott"&gt;{{citation|author=Timothy Endicott|title=Administrative Law|location=New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|page=110|isbn=978-0-19-927728-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Michael Mustill, Baron Mustill|Lord Mustill]] famously held in ''[[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p Doody]]'' (1993): "Since the person affected usually cannot make worthwhile representations without knowing what factors may weigh against his interests fairness will very often require that he is informed of the gist of the case which he has to answer."&lt;ref name=Doody&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Doody|link=R v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p Doody|court=UKHL|year=1993|num=8|parallelcite=[1994] 1 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 531 at 560|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Kioa v West|page=582|q=It is a fundamental rule of the common law doctrine of natural justice expressed in traditional terms that, generally speaking, when an order is to be made which will deprive a person of some right or interest or the legitimate expectation of a benefit, he is entitled to know the case sought to be made against him and to be given an opportunity of replying to it ... . The reference to right or interest in this formulation must be understood as relating to personal liberty, status, preservation of livelihood and reputation, as well as to proprietary rights and interests.}}

It has been suggested that the requirement of prior notice serves three important purposes:{{r|Endicott|p=127}}

*The interest in good outcomes – giving prior notice increases the value of the proceedings as it is only when the interested person knows the issues and the relevant information that he or she can make a useful contribution.
*The duty of respect – the affected person has the right to know what is at stake, and it is not enough to simply inform him or her that there will be a hearing.
*The [[rule of law]] – notice of issues and disclosure of information opens up the operations of the public authority to public scrutiny.

The British courts have held it is not enough for an affected person to merely be informed of a hearing. He or she must also be told what is at stake; in other words, the gist of the case.{{r|Endicott|p=127}}

====Opportunity to be heard====
Every person has the right to have a hearing and be allowed to present his or her own case.{{r|Kioa v West|page=582}} Should a person not attend the hearing, even with adequate notice given, the adjudicator has the discretion to decide if the hearing should proceed. In ''Ridge v Baldwin'', a [[Chief Constable|chief constable]] succeeded in having his dismissal from service declared void as he had not been given the opportunity to make a defence. In another case, ''Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v Evans'' (1982),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v Evans|court=UKHL|year=1982|num=10|parallelcite=[1982] 1 W.L.R. 1155|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a chief constable required a police probationer to resign on account of allegations about his private life which he was given no fair opportunity to rebut. The House of Lords found the dismissal to be unlawful. Likewise in ''[[Surinder Singh Kanda v Federation of Malaya]]'' (1962),&lt;ref name=Kanda/&gt; a public servant facing disciplinary proceedings was not supplied with a copy of a prejudicial report by a board of inquiry which the adjudicating officer had access to before the hearing. The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] held that the proceedings had failed to provide him a reasonable opportunity of being heard.

However, this requirement does not necessarily mean the decision-maker has to meet the complainant face to face – "Natural justice does not generally demand orality".&lt;ref name="Morgan Grenfell"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. (Morgan Grenfell &amp; Co Ltd) v Special Commissioner of Income Tax|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=2001|num=329|parallelcite=[2002] 2 W.L.R. 255 at 286, para. 47|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that an oral hearing will almost be as good as useless if the affected person has no prior knowledge of the case.{{r|Morgan Grenfell|p=287|q=paragraph 50}} In ''Lloyd v McMahon'' (1987),&lt;ref name="Lloyd"&gt;''Lloyd v McMahon'' [1987] 1 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 625, [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] (UK).&lt;/ref&gt; an oral hearing did not make a difference to the facts on which the case was based. Giving judgment in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, [[Lord Justice of Appeal|Lord Justice]] [[Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|Harry Woolf]] held that an oral hearing may not always be the "very pith of the administration of natural justice".{{r|Lloyd|p=670|q=citing R v Local Government Board, ex parte Arlidge [1914] 1 KB 160 at 192–193, High Court (Kings Bench) (England &amp; Wales).}} It has also been suggested that an oral hearing is only required if issues concerning deprivations of legal rights or legally protected interests arise.{{r|Endicott|p=128}}

====Conduct of the hearing====
When deciding how the hearing should be conducted, the adjudicator has to ask whether the person charged has a proper opportunity to consider, challenge or contradict any evidence, and whether the person is also fully aware of the nature of the allegations against him or her so as to have a proper opportunity to present his or her own case.&lt;ref name="Kay Swee Pin"&gt;''Kay Swee Pin v. Singapore Island Country Club'' [2008] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 802 at 806, para. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Secretary of State for the Home Department v AF'' (2009),&lt;ref name="AF"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Secretary of State for the Home Department v AF|court=UKHL|year=2009|num=28|parallelcite=[2010] 2 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 269|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Phillips, Baron Phillips of Worth Matravers|Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers]] said:

{{quote|The best way of producing a fair trial is to ensure that a party to it has the fullest information of both the allegations that are made against him and the evidence relied upon in support of those allegations. Where the evidence is documentary, he should have access to the documents. Where the evidence consists of oral testimony, then he should be entitled to cross-examine the witnesses who give that testimony, whose identities should be disclosed.{{r|AF|p=355|q=paragraph 64}}}}

However, when a hearing requires the balancing of multiple [[wikt:polycentric|polycentric]] issues such as natural justice and the protection of confidential information for national security reasons, both the concerns of public security and the right to a fair trial must be adequately met. It was held by the House of Lords in ''AF'',{{r|AF}} applying the decision of the Grand Chamber of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ''A v United Kingdom'' (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=A v United Kingdom|court=ECHR|year=2009|num=301|parallelcite=(2009) 49 E.H.R.R. 625|courtname=E.C.H.R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a person accused of terrorism against whom a [[control order]] has been issued must be given sufficient information about the allegations against him to enable him to give effective instructions to his [[special advocate]]. If this requirement is satisfied, a fair hearing can be conducted without detailed disclosure of confidential information that might compromise national security. On the facts of the case, a special advocate was not permitted further contact with an applicant or his ordinary legal representatives except with permission of the [[Special Immigration Appeals Commission]] (SIAC) after viewing confidential (or "closed") materials. The House of Lords recognized that although a special advocate's usefulness is stymied somewhat from having no further instructions after viewing such materials, if the SIAC decides to issue a control order predominantly on the basis of non-confidential (or "open") materials, an applicant cannot be regarded as having been denied an opportunity to challenge the reasonableness of the government's beliefs and suspicions about him. If the evidence against the applicant is largely closed but allegations contained in open material are sufficiently specific, an applicant should be able to provide his legal representatives and special advocate with information to refute it (such as an [[alibi]], if the open material alleges he was at a certain place during a certain period) without having to know the detail or sources of the closed evidence. However, if the evidence revealed to the person consists only of general assertions and the case against him is based solely or to a substantive extent on undisclosed adverse evidence, the fair hearing rule under natural justice will not be satisfied.{{r|AF|p=350-2|q=paragraph 51, citing A v United Kingdom, paragraphs 215–220}}

In such cases, there are strong policy considerations supporting the principle that a trial procedure can never be considered fair if a person is kept in ignorance of the case against him or her. First, since the grounds for a reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in terrorist activity can span from incontrovertible evidence to an innocent misinterpretation of facts which can be explained away by the person, in many cases it is impossible for courts to be sure that the disclosure of the evidence will make no difference to the applicant. Secondly, resentment will be felt by the person and his family and friends if sanctions are imposed without any proper explanation of the grounds and when, due to the non-disclosure of information, the person is put in a position where he is unable to properly defend himself. As Lord Phillips put it, "if the wider public are to have confidence in the justice system, they need to be able to see that justice is done rather than being asked to take it on trust".{{r|AF|p=355|q=paragraph 63}}

The right to be heard in answer to charges before an unbiased tribunal is illustrated in the Singapore case ''Tan Boon Chee David v. Medical Council of Singapore'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;''Tan Boon Chee David v. Medical Council of Singapore'' [1979–1980] S.L.R.(R.) 523, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; During a disciplinary hearing, council members were either not conscientious about their attendance or did not attend the whole course of proceedings. This meant they did not hear all the oral evidence and submissions. The High Court held that this had substantially prejudiced the appellant and constituted a fundamental breach of natural justice. On the other hand, mere absence from a hearing does not necessarily lead to undue prejudice. It was held in ''Re Teo Choo Hong'' (1995)&lt;ref&gt;''Re Teo Choo Hong'' [1995] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 441, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; that the function of a lay member of a lawyers' disciplinary committee was to observe and not cast a vote or make a judgment. Thus, the appellant had not suffered undue prejudice.

On the basis of reciprocity, if one side is allowed to cross-examine his legal opponent at a hearing, the other party must also be given the same opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;''Howe Yoon Chong v Chief Assessor'' [1977–1978] S.L.R.(R.) 386, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, when a tribunal decides a case on a basis not raised or contemplated by the parties, or decides it without regarding the submissions and arguments made by the parties on the issues, this will amount to a breach of natural justice.&lt;ref&gt;''Front Row Investment Holdings (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. v. Daimler South East Asia Pte. Ltd.'' [2010] SGHC 80 at para. 31, H.C. (Singapore); see also ''R v Industrial Injuries Commissioner, ex parte Howarth'' (1968) 4 K.I.R. 621; ''Kay Swee Pin'', p. 806, para. 7: "[I]f a tribunal, after the close of the hearing, comes into possession of further evidence, the party affected should be invited to comment upon it".&lt;/ref&gt; However, a genuine ''[[good faith#Good faith in law|bona fide]]'' mistake by an adjudicator in omitting to state reasons for not considering a submission is not enough to be a breach of natural justice.&lt;ref name="SEF Construction"&gt;''SEF Construction Pte. Ltd. v. Skoy Connected Pte. Ltd.'' [2010] 1 S.L.R. 733 at 757, para. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur when the submissions were accidentally omitted, or were so unconvincing that it was not necessary to explicitly state the adjudicator's findings.{{r|SEF Construction|pp=758–759|q=paragraph 60}}

====Right to legal representation====
There is no inherent common law right to legal representation before a domestic tribunal. A tribunal has the discretion to admit either a legally qualified or unqualified counsel to assist the person appearing before it, based on the facts of the case.&lt;ref&gt;''Kok Seng Chong v. Bukit Turf Club'' [1992] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 772, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; When assessing whether a party should be offered legal assistance, the adjudicator should first ask whether the right to be heard applies, and, secondly, whether counsel's assistance is needed for an effective hearing given the subject matter, bearing in mind the consequences of such a denial.{{r|Thio|p=192}}

In ''R v Secretary of State for Home Department, ex parte Tarrant'' (1983),&lt;ref name="ex parte Tarrant"&gt;''R v Secretary of State for Home Department, ex parte Tarrant'' [1985] 1 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 251, [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]] (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; Webster J. set out six factors to be considered when deciding whether to allow representation by counsel, namely:{{r|ex parte Tarrant|pp=285–6}}

*the seriousness of the charge and the potential penalty;
*whether any points of law are likely to arise.;
*whether the prisoner is capable of presenting his own case;
*whether there are any procedural difficulties faced by prisoners in conducting their own defence;
*whether there is reasonable speed in making the adjudication; and
*whether there is a need for fairness between prisoners or between prisoners and prison officers.

It has also been suggested that where a tribunal hearing concerns the individual's reputation or right to livelihood, there is a greater need for allowing legal representation as this vindicates the idea of [[equality before the law]].&lt;ref&gt;''Doresamy v. Public Services Commission'' [1971] 2 ''Malayan Law Journal'' 127, [[High Courts of Malaysia|High Court]] (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt;

When one refuses legal representation, one cannot expect to receive a higher "standard" of natural justice. This was enunciated in Singapore in ''Ho Paul v. Singapore Medical Council'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;''Ho Paul v. Singapore Medical Council'' [2008] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 780, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ho, who had been charged with professional misconduct, chose to appear before the Council in person and declined to cross-examine the Council's key witness. Subsequently, he argued that he should have been warned of the legal implications of not being legally represented. The High Court rejected this argument and held he had suffered no prejudice. Dr. Ho had been given a fair opportunity of presenting his own case and, most importantly, had not been deprived of his right to cross-examine the witnesses.

It is also not a court's obligation to provide assistance when a party presents his or her case without legal representation. In ''Rajeevan Edakalavan v. Public Prosecutor'' (1998),&lt;ref name="Rajeevan Edakalavan"&gt;''Rajeevan Edakalavan v. Public Prosecutor'' [1998] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 10, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; the accused had appeared in person before a magistrate and had entered a [[plea]] of guilt. He later petitioned the High Court for criminal revision, arguing that as the magistrate had not informed him of the [[defense (legal)|defences]] available to him, his plea had been equivocal. The Court held:{{r|Rajeevan Edakalavan|p=19|q=paragraph 22}}

{{quote|The onus [of informing the accused of his defence options or what could be more advantageous to his case] does not shift to the judge (or the Prosecution, for that matter) simply because the accused is unrepresented. That will be placing too onerous a burden on the judge. Furthermore, the judge will be performing two completely incompatible and irreconcilable roles – one as the adjudicator, the other as the ''[[de facto]]'' defence counsel.}}

In Singapore, the right to legal representation is contingent on the nature of the inquiry. However, since [[Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore|Article 12]] of the [[Constitution of Singapore]] guarantees equal protection under the law, it has been suggested that greater weightage should be accorded to this procedural right when balancing it against the competing demand of efficiency.{{r|Thio|p=193–4}}

====The decision and reasons for it====
Currently, the principles of natural justice in the United Kingdom and certain other jurisdictions do not include a general rule that reasons should be given for decisions.&lt;ref name=Doody/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Re Siah Mooi Guat'' [1988] 2. S.L.R.(R.) 165 at 178–179, para. 34, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''R v Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Shaw'' (1951),&lt;ref name="ex parte Shaw"&gt;''R v Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Shaw'' [1952] 1 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 338, [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]] (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Denning]] L.J. stated: "I think the record must contain at least the document which initiates the proceedings; the pleadings, if any; and the adjudication; but not the evidence, nor the reasons, unless the tribunal chooses to incorporate them. If the tribunal does state its reasons, and those reasons are wrong in law, certiorari lies to quash the decision."{{r|ex parte Shaw|p=352}} It has been stated that "no single factor has inhibited the development of English administrative law as seriously as the absence of any general obligation upon public authorities to give reasons for their decisions".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Keith Frank Goodfellow|title=Administration under Law: A Report by [[JUSTICE]] |location=London |publisher=Stevens |year=1971 |page=23 |isbn=978-0-420-43710-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, uncontrolled public decisions have led to poor outcomes and disrespect for the decision-makers. Such decisions also lacked the regularity and transparency that distinguish them from the mere say-so of public authorities. On such grounds, there are obvious benefits for the disclosure of reasons for decisions. First, procedural participation by people affected by a decision promotes the rule of law by making it more difficult for the public authority to act arbitrarily.{{r|Endicott|p=110}} Requiring the giving of reasons helps ensure that decisions are carefully thought through, which in turn aids in the control of administrative discretion.{{r|Thio|p=194}} Secondly, accountability makes it necessary for the public authority to face up to the people affected by a decision. When a public authority acts on all the relevant considerations, this increases the probability of better decision outcomes and, as such, is beneficial to public interests. Another important benefit is that respect for decision-makers is fostered, which increases their integrity in the public's eyes.{{r|Endicott|p=110}}

This article describes the various laws related to non profit organisations in India. A [[Non Profit Organisation|non profit organisations]] can be registered in [[India]] as a Society, under the Registrar of Societies or as a [[Trust company|Trust]], by making a Trust deed, or as a Section 8 Company, under the Companies Act, 2013.

Whether a trust, society or Section 8 company, the Income Tax Act, 1961 gives all categories equal treatment, in terms of exempting their income and granting 80G certificates, whereby donors to non-profit organisations may claim a rebate against donations made. Foreign contributions to non-profits are governed by FC(R)A regulations and the Home Ministry.

For an organisation to be termed as [[Charitable organization|charity]] it requires Income tax clearances under 12 A Clause of Income Tax Act. Section 2(15) of the Income Tax Act defines ‘charitable purpose’ to include ‘relief of the poor, education, medical relief and the advancement of any other object of general public utility’. A purpose that relates exclusively to religious teaching or worship is not considered as charitable.

==Registration==
Registering a Non Profit in India can be done in a total of five ways:

* Trust
* Society
* Section-8 Company under Companies Act, 2013 (It was earlier Section-25 Under Companies Act, 1956)
* Special Licensing
* Section-25 Company (In old companies Act - Companies Act, 1956)

==Trusts==
A public charitable trust is usually floated when there is a property involved, especially in terms of land and building.

===Legislation===
Different states in India have different Trusts Acts in force, which govern the trusts in the state; in the absence of a Trusts Act in any particular state or territory the general principles of the Indian Trusts Act 1882 are applied.

===Main Instrument===
The main instrument of any public charitable trust is the trust deed, wherein the aims and objects and mode of management (of the trust) should be enshrined. In every trust deed, the minimum and maximum number of trustees has to be specified. The trust deed should clearly spell out the aims and objects of the trust, how the trust should be managed, how other trustees may be appointed or removed, etc. The trust deed should be signed by both the settlor/s and trustee/s in the presence of two witnesses. The trust deed should be executed on non-judicial stamp paper, the value of which would depend on the valuation of the trust property.

===Application for Registration===
* The application for registration should be made to the official having jurisdiction over the region in which the trust is sought to be registered.
* After providing details (in the form) regarding designation by which the public trust shall be known, names of trustees, mode of succession, etc., the applicant has to affix a court fee stamp of Rs.2/- to the form and pay a very nominal registration fee which may range from Rs.3/- to Rs.25/-, depending on the value of the trust property.
* The application form should be signed by the applicant before the regional officer or superintendent of the regional office of the charity commissioner or a notary. The application form should be submitted, together with a copy of the trust deed.
* Two other documents which should be submitted at the time of making an application for registration are affidavit and consent letter.

==Society==
According to section 20 of the Societies Registration Act, 1860, the following societies can be registered under the Act: ‘charitable societies, military orphan funds or societies established at the several presidencies of India, societies established for the promotion of science, literature, or the fine arts, for instruction, the diffusion of useful knowledge, the diffusion of political education, the foundation or maintenance of libraries or reading rooms for general use among the members or open to the public, or public museums and galleries of paintings and other works of art, collection of natural history, mechanical and philosophical inventions, instruments or designs.’

===Legislation===
Societies are registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, which is a federal act. However, every state has its own legislation of Societies Act, which lays down the procedures for registration, management and dissolution of the Society.

===Main Instrument===
The main instrument of any society is the memorandum of association and rules and regulations (no stamp paper required), wherein the aims and objects and mode of management (of the society) should be enshrined.

The main instrument of any society is the memorandum of association and article of association.

Memorandum of association is the charter of a society. It is a document depicting and describing the objects of the its existence and its operations.
However, article of association includes rules and regulations of the society under which it works.

===Trustees===
A Society needs a minimum of seven managing committee members; there is no upper limit to the number of managing committee members. The Board of Management is in the form of a governing body or council or a managing or executive committee

===Application for Registration===
Registration can be done either at the state level (i.e., in the office of the Registrar of Societies) or at the district level (in the office of the District Magistrate or the local office of the Registrar of Societies).

* The procedure varies from state to state. However generally the application should be submitted together with: (a) memorandum of association and rules and regulations; (b) consent letters of all the members of the managing committee; (c) authority letter duly signed by all the members of the managing committee; (d) an affidavit sworn by the president or secretary of the society on non-judicial stamp paper of Rs.20-/, together with a court fee stamp; and (e) a declaration by the members of the managing committee that the funds of the society will be used only for the purpose of furthering the aims and objects of the society.
* All the aforesaid documents which are required for the application for registration should be submitted in duplicate, together with the required registration fee. Unlike the trust deed, the memorandum of association and rules and regulations need not be executed on stamp paper.

==Section-8 Company==
According to section 8(1)(a), (b) and (c) of the Indian Companies Act, 2013, a section-8 company can be established ‘for promoting commerce, art, science, sports, education, research, social welfare, religion, charity, protection of environment or any such other  object’, provided the profits, if any, or other income is applied for promoting only the objectives of the company and no dividend is paid to its members.

===Legislation===
Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013

===Main Instrument===
For a section-8 company, the main instrument is a Memorandum and articles of association (no stamp paper required)

===Trustees===
A section-8 Company needs a minimum of three trustees; there is no upper limit to the number of trustees. The Board of Management is in the form of a Board of directors or managing committee and should preferably be Indian nationals.

===Application for Registration===
1. An application has to be made for availability of name to the registrar of companies, which must be made in the prescribed form no. INC-1, together with a fee of '''Rs.1000/-'''. It is advisable to suggest a choice of five other names by which the company will be called, in case the first name which is proposed is not found acceptable by the registrar.

2. Once the availability of name is confirmed, an application should be made in writing to the regional director of the company law board. The application should be accompanied by the following documents:

3. The applicants should also, within a week from the date of making the application to the registrar of the companies, publish a notice in the prescribed manner at least once in a newspaper in a principal language of the district in which the registered office India of the proposed company is to be situated or is situated and circulating in that district, and at least once in an English newspaper circulating in that district.

4. The registrar of companies may, after considering the objections, if any, received within 30 days from the date of publication of the notice in the newspapers, and after consulting any authority, department or ministry, as he may, in his discretion, decide, determine whether the licence should or should not be granted.

5. The registrar of companies may also direct the company to insert in its memorandum, or in its articles, or in both, such conditions of the licence as may be specified by him in this behalf.

==Special Licensing==
In addition to registration, a non-profit engaged in certain activities might also require special license/permission. Some of these include (but are not limited to):
# A place of work in a restricted area (like a tribal area or a border area requires a special permit – the Inner Line Permit – usually issues either by the Ministry of Home Affairs or by the relevant local authority (i.e., district magistrate).
# To open an office and employ people, the NGO should be registered under the Shop and Establishment Act.
# To employ foreign staff, an Indian non-profit needs to be registered as a trust/society/company, have FCRA registration and also obtain a No Objection Certificate. The intended employee also needs a work visa.
# A foreign not-for-profit may be registered as a branch, liaison or project office [and not necessarily as an Indian entity] after the requisite permission has been granted by the RBI. Upon receipt of approval from the RBI, the foreign office must within 30 days seek registration under the Companies Act, 1956. Alongside of these permissions, the office must acquire tax registrations.
&lt;!-- A foreign non-profit setting up an office in India [what kind of office?] and wanting staff from abroad needs to be registered as a trust/society/company [why as an Indian entity?], needs permission from the Reserve Bank of India [an Indian entity does not need RBI approval for setting up of an office!] and also a No Objection Certificate from the Ministry of External Affairs [Foreigner's Division exists in the Ministry of Home Affairs]. [This needs major editing, very vague, factually incorrect and confusing.] --&gt;

'''Patrick Dils''' (born 30 June 1970 in [[Longeville-lès-Metz]]) is a French victim of a [[miscarriage of justice]]. He was accused of the murder of two boys in [[Montigny-lès-Metz]], in [[Moselle]] on the 30th of April 1987, at the age of 16. On the 27 January 1989, the court sentenced him to life imprisonment for murder. On the 24 April 2002 after spending 15 years in prison, he was exonerated. The [[French government]] gave him one million euros (of which 700,000 euros in compensation) for [[Miscarriage of justice|judicial mistake]]. This is one of the most serious judicial mistakes recognized in France and it’s the first one concerning a minor sentenced to life imprisonment for murder.

==Case==
On the 28 September 1986, two children, Cyril Beining born in 1978, and Alexandre Beckrich, were found dead alongside a [[SNCF]] track in Montigny-lès-Metz. Patrick Dils, who was 16 years old at the time and a trainee cook, was questioned because he was living in the same street as the victims and he was denounced by an anonymous call. His timetable did not match with the hour of the murder indicated by the [[coroner]] so he was released.

On the 28 April 1987, following a new testimony which reconsidered the time of death indicated by the coroner, he was taken in for questioning after finishing his shift at a restaurant in Montigny-lès-Metz. After 36 hours in custody and [[police interrogation]] which lasted a few days, he admitted the murders and stated that he didn’t know the reasons for the crimes.

On the 30 April 1987, he was charged with [[voluntary homicide]]s and sent to the prison of Metz-Queuleu. He gave a different version to his attorney but the investigating judge organized a reconstruction on the 7 May during which he continued to admit the crime. Moreover, he recognized the rocks which served for the crime. This fact convinced the judge of his guilt. According to his parents, he didn’t realize the importance of the procedure. But, on the 30 May 1987, he wrote to his attorney to modify his declarations.

==Investigation==

Seven months passed between the murder and Dils arrest. Dils parents described Bernard Varlet, who was Inspector of Judicial Police of Metz and in charge of the investigation, as very aggressive and relentless against Dils. Varlet had already obtained confessions from two other suspects, but these were rejected.

Throughout the investigation investigators obtained confessions from three different people, all single, living with their parents and having a low level of education. The first suspect who confessed was Mr. L., on 10 December 1986, who worked one hundred meters from the scene of the murder.  According to the report of the hearing, he accurately described the bike and children's clothing. Police doubted his confession after he failed to climb up a slope at the crime scene during a reconstruction.

On 12 February 1987, investigators arrested a new suspect for "[[outraging public decency]]."  After confessing, he was eventually also exonerated because of inconsistencies in his testimony. Dils was the last remaining suspect investigators had. They believed he was guilty despite the inconsistencies that remained around the timeline of the murder, and the difficulty that a teenager may have had in causing the extreme physical violence acts perpetrated on the victims.

The judge at the time, Ms. Mireille Maubert, appeared to have the same view as the investigators.  When Dils parents requested a permit to visit their son, she told them they would never see him. For sixteen months she refused to grant a permit.

==Sentencing==

On the 27 January 1989, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder by the juvenile ''[[Cour d'assises]]'' of Moselle. They didn’t take into account that he was minor, however, the excuse of minority which was constantly presented to the jury would have permitted to half the sentence (for the current law but at this time, being a minor would have only reduced the sentence to a maximum of 25 years). For the first time since April 1987, his parents were allowed to see him for 5 minutes in a corridor controlled by policemen. Victims’ parents said that they would have preferred the [[death penalty]] for Patrick Dils (abolished in France for minors in 1980 and then fully in 1981).

==Appeals==
Dils' lawyers filed the first request for review with the Court of Cassation on 26 July 1990. The request was rejected. On 6 May 1994, Dils requested a presidential pardon from [[François Mitterrand]], who refused him. Mitterrand wrote to the victim's family and assured them that he would never grant clemency to a murderer of children.

==New facts==

Chief Warrant Officer gendarmerie, Jean-François Abgrall, from the research section of the gendarmerie [[Rennes]], was a specialist in cases where the serial killer [[Francis Heaulme]] was convicted, indicted or a suspect. On 24 October 1997 he  sent a legal document detailing a conversation he had considered during the 1992 arrest of Heaulme in [[Brest, France|Brest]].  In the minutes, Abgrall wrote: "Francis Heaulme kept us the following statement, saying he had done a bike ride along a railroad track in eastern France, have been stones thrown by two children, leaving, then passing by the scene a few minutes later, when he saw the bodies of two children near cars and garbage near a bridge, seeing the scene of firefighters and police officers."

Abgrall immediately conducted research on any unsolved crimes involving two children. There was no trace of a double murder because at that time (1992), Patrick Dils had already been convicted and the double murder had been removed from the database.

In 1998, Dils' parents, who still believe their son was innocent, asked two lawyers, Parisian masters Jean-Marc Florand and Karim Achoui, to reconsider the case.  Interested in Francis Heaulme, they sent a letter to the gendarmerie Rennes. Abgrall decided to write the minutes of the legal information, and 27 March 1998, Florand filed a new petition for review after learning that the serial killer Francis Heaulme was near the scene of the crime at the time it took place.

[[Court of Cassation (France)|Supreme Court magistrate]], Jean Favard, began his investigation from a record of criminal intelligence.  He visited Francis Heaulme and obtained new details about his schedule on 29 September 1986, the day of the double murder. At the time of the murder Heaulme worked in a business located 400 meters from the crime scene.  He acknowledged having been on site at the day, time and exact location of the crimes, seeing the children having stones thrown on their heads by the two children, but denied carrying out the double murder.  However, his presence is a "new fact likely to raise doubts about the guilt of the condemned."  The counselor rapporteur of the Committee on Revision published two reports dated 30 June 1998 and 16 July 1998.

On 21 June 1999, the board of review of criminal convictions, chaired by Henri Le Gall, found that the evidence adduced was totally unknown to the file of the [[Assizes|Court of Assizes of minors]] in 1989 and can only cast doubt on Patrick Dils' guilt.  He agreed to submit the file to the Dils Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court sitting as a [[Court of appeal|Court of Revision]].  It concluded that it should order further investigations and conduct further hearings of witnesses already heard in 1986 and 1989, but by comparing the statements of Francis Heaulme.

==Acquittal==

On 21 April 2001, the Court of Revision quashed Dils' conviction but refused to release him pending a retrial.  On 20 June 2001 a new trial opened before the Assize Court of the minor [[Marne]]. Francis Heaulme appeared as a witness, but he refused to take responsibility for the double murder, despite the suspicions against him. On June 29, 2001, the court sentenced Dils to twenty-five years imprisonment, to everyone's surprise.  The journalists had already prepared their articles announcing his acquittal, at the time the [[Advocate General]] had expressed his personal belief: according to him, Patrick Dils could not be the culprit, he would not have had time to commit the crime.  Convicted again, Patrick Dils had ten days to appeal.

The third trial in the Assize Court minors [[Rhône]] opened on 8 April 2002.  The law now allowed the trial to be held in public. The majority of public opinion was in favor of Patrick Dils, who appeared with a new look, without sunglasses and relaxed.  Francis Heaulme was heard again, with prosecution testimony against him.  Witnesses said they saw him covered in blood the day of the incident, which he confirmed himself at the bar, claiming to have fallen off his bike. For the first time, Patrick Dils spoke of the torments he endured in prison; he was beaten, mocked and raped.  He returned to his very detailed confession, which was one of the only pieces of evidence pointing to Dils' guilt.

It is still unclear exactly why Dils first accused himself at the beginning of the case.  Evidence was produced by the police, showing that Patrick Dils did not have time to commit the crime: the children died around 17:00, while Patrick Dils was back home until about 18:45.  On 23 April 2002, the General Counsel did not charge or penalty or sentence him, the jury deliberated for a few hours and Patrick Dils was acquitted on 24 April 2002.  He was released from jail the same evening. The families of the victims were disappointed, convinced that the court had released a murderer.

'''Pliny Fisk III''' (born May 30, 1944 in New York) – is a co-founder and co-director of the „Center for Maximum Potential Building Systems“ (CMPBS): &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmpbs.org/cmpbs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005071933/http://www.cmpbs.org/cmpbs.html |archivedate=October 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[sustainable design]] and planning 501c3 non-profit established in 1975. Fisk – also serves as &lt;u&gt;Fellow in Sustainable Urbanism&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;Fellow in Health Systems Design&lt;/u&gt; – at [[Texas A&amp;M University|Texas A &amp; M University]], where he holds a joint position: as signature faculty in Architecture, Landscape Architecture and Planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archone.tamu.edu/LAUP/People/Faculty/faculty_profile/Fisk.html|title=Welcome - College of Architecture|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisk – has previously held positions at: 

* [[Ball State University]];
* [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas]] (at [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]);
* [[Mississippi State University]];
* [[University of Oklahoma]].

==Education and personal life==
Fisk – received B.Arch., M.Arch., and M.L.Arch. degrees – from the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. His graduate studies – focused on ecological land planning under the guidance of [[Ian McHarg]]. His work – has also been influenced substantially by [[Russell Ackoff]] in various disciplines associated with the systems sciences. 

He – has four children and is married to [[Gail Vittori]].

==Work==
Fisk’s special contributions in the research field – have been principally in materials and methods; &lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/ecopioneers.htm |title=Eco-Pioneers: Practical Visionaries Solving Today's Environmental Problems |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=1997-11-05 |accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; from low-cost building systems development (referred to as „open building“) – to wide-ranging material development (that includes: low carbon and carbon balanced cements, and many other low impact materials). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/international/2009/10/01/gg.fisk.innovator.building.cnn |title=Video News - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He – was instrumental in developing the first input/output life cycle assessment model for material flow in the U.S. and connecting this to a Geographic Information System, – so that human activities can be placed into the context of natural systems on a national scale. The model for preserving abundant, naturally renewable resources – is entirely removed from the questions of social equity, quality of environment and human welfare. The model – represents greenhouse gases, criteria air pollutants and toxic releases – of over 12,500,000 businesses. He – has also developed an alternative land planning and design methodology (referred to – as „Eco- Balance Design and Planning“).   
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“...(the Center’s) work grows out of a literal and metaphysical map of the ecology and resources of a region.  The material cycles, the energy flows, the water in a region is really what it’s all about.”
-[[Jane Holtz Kay]], ''Architecture Magazine''&lt;ref&gt;Kay, Jane Holtz. “The Greening of Architecture.” Architecture 80 (May 1991): 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Once considered on the fringe, – the [Center for Maximum Potential Building Systems] ... is now widely considered to be in the vanguard of the country's eco-friendly or 'green building' movement."
-Patricia Leigh Brown, ''New York Times''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Like Buckminster Fuller, – Pliny’s ideas may be more appreciated a hundred years from now.”
-George James, U.S. Dept. of Energy, ''New York Times''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"He's given the whole movement a more technical bent – and a less touchy-feely direction."
-James White, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, ''New York Times''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leigh |first=Patricia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/15/garden/mr-fisk-builds-his-green-house.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Mr. Fisk Builds His Green House |location=Austin, Tx, Usa; Austin (Tex) |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1996-02-15 |accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Early work===
After completing his education at [[University of Pennsylvania]], – Fisk worked for [[Ian McHarg]] (in Philadelphia); and (in 1969) he assisted McHarg – as the coordinator of engineering and ecology for [[Eastern New Orleans|New Orleans East]]: a new town of 100,000 (on the Mississippi Delta). He – served as an Assistant Professor at [[Ball State University]]: for one year (1969–1970), – before accepting a teaching position at The [[University of Texas at Austin]]. &lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"&gt;"Pliny the Greener" ''Architecture Magazine'' June 1998, 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center for Maximum Potential Building Systems===
In 1975 (with a seed grant from the Menil Foundation), – Fisk (and his then wife: Daria Bolton) founded the [[Center for Maximum Potential Building Systems]] (CMPBS) in Austin, Texas. &lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;  CMPBS – is a nonprofit 501(c)3 education, research, and demonstration organization.

The CMPBS site – features numerous demonstration projects: including the „Advanced Green Builder Demonstration Home“ (AGBDH) – a 170 square meter structure, featuring numerous sustainable building techniques, including: a 50,000 liter rainwater harvesting system and two methods of [[straw-bale construction]]. The AGBDH – is the first modern building in the U.S. to use 100% Portland Cement-free concrete. The concrete used in the building – is a fly-ash, Caliche mix (developed by CMPBS). The AGBDH – was also designed for easy disassembly; pays particular attention – to the lifecycles of water, energy and materials; and incorporates local and recycled materials. &lt;ref&gt;"Center for Maximum Potential Building Systems" ''Contemporary American Architects'' Vol. IV. Taschen Press, 1998. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmpbs.org/publications/AD3.6-Texas_Recycled.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920095807/http://www.cmpbs.org/publications/AD3.6-Texas_Recycled.pdf |archivedate=September 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AGBDH – currently serves as the main offices for CMPBS.

Other examples of Fisk's work on the CMPBS site – include the '''2002''' University of Texas at Austin entry for the Department of Energy [[Solar Decathlon]] competition, the Greenforms&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; erector-set prototype and a foam and MgO Cement modular building system.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;

Pliny Fisk – currently co-directs CMPBS with his wife ([[Gail Vittori]]).

===Crystal City, Nicaragua and the Laredo Demonstration Farm===
[[File:LaredoDemonstrationFarm.png|thumb|Site of Laredo Demonstration Farm, now the Lamar Bruni Vergara Environmental Science Center]]
When the „Lo Vaca Gathering Co“ shut off the natural gas supply to the small town of [[Crystal City, Texas|Crystal City (Texas)]] in the fall of '''1977''', – Fisk developed the idea of using Army surplus wood stoves and abundant mesquite for heating. By January 1978, Crystal City residents – had installed nearly 1,000 wood stoves. In subsequent years – Fisk led an effort to manufacture and install inexpensive solar hot water heaters using salvaged materials. The production of the solar collectors – also helped bolster the job market of Crystal City. &lt;ref&gt;"The Town that turned off the gas" ''The Christian Science Monitor''December 7, 1979, B1.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmpbs.org/publications/T1.6-Crystal_City_pa.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123000749/http://www.cmpbs.org/publications/T1.6-Crystal_City_pa.pdf |archivedate=November 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmpbs.org/publications/T6-Solar_Collector.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919032417/http://cmpbs.org/publications/T6-Solar_Collector.pdf |archivedate=September 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''1983''', Fisk was sponsored by the „Center for Investigation and Documentation of the Atlantic Coast“ (CIDCA) – to set into motion a large scale indigenous housing program for the [[Miskito people|Miskito Indians]] of Nicaragua's Atlantic Coast. Fisk's goal in the project – was to draw upon the available natural and human resources of the region to address an extreme housing shortage. He – helped develop building materials, using abundant stocks – of: 

* [[Kaolinite]] High Alumina Clay;
* waste sawdust and woodchips;
* waste rice husks. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmpbs.org/publications/MP1.1-Miskito.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919031045/http://cmpbs.org/publications/MP1.1-Miskito.pdf |archivedate=September 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''1991''': the [[Texas Department of Agriculture]] (and – [[Laredo Junior College]]) – hired Fisk (and CMPBS): to design and build a demonstration farm (outside the arid South Texas city, of [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]]). The {{convert|2|acre|m2|adj=on}} farm:

* integrated local materials: in its mesquite wood floors and straw-bale buildings;
* achieved passive cooling: with wind towers;
* salvaged steel oil-rig drilling stems: for the super-structure, of the facility. 

Shade structures – protect the farm (from the often extreme South Texas sun). &lt;ref&gt;"Blueprint for Survival" ''Architecture Magazine'', May 1991, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmpbs.org/publications/AD3.1-Sust_Farm.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920095712/http://www.cmpbs.org/publications/AD3.1-Sust_Farm.pdf |archivedate=September 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmpbs.org/publications/AD3.7-Orig_Concept.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920095813/http://www.cmpbs.org/publications/AD3.7-Orig_Concept.pdf |archivedate=September 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmpbs.org/publications/AD10-Laredo_Dem.pps |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920092726/http://www.cmpbs.org/publications/AD10-Laredo_Dem.pps |archivedate=September 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===City of Austin: Green Building Program===
In '''1991''', Fisk and Vittori – developed "&lt;u&gt;A Conceptual and Contextual Framework (for the City of Austin)&lt;/u&gt;"; that – served as the basis – for the formation of the world's first municipal green building program (now – operating as „Austin Energy Green Building“). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmpbs.org/publications/PE7-Sust_rating.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919025250/http://cmpbs.org/publications/PE7-Sust_rating.pdf |archivedate=September 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://my.austinenergy.com/wps/portal/aegb/aegb/home/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gLAwMDZydDRwP3EG8XA09nywBD55AwYyM_Y_1wkA48Kgwh8gY4gKOBvp9Hfm6qfkF2dpqjo6IiAFSVM1o!/dl3/d3/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cooperative effort – earned the United Nations &lt;u&gt;Earth Summit&lt;/u&gt; Award: for &lt;u&gt;Exemplary Public Environmental Initiative&lt;/u&gt;, in '''1992''' (the only United States organization – to receive recognition at the [[Earth Summit]]).

==Innovations and ideas==

=== Area Point Resource Network===
Developed in '''1978''', the &lt;u&gt;Area Point Resource Network&lt;/u&gt; – is a tool for coordinating the natural, technological and human resources (within a region). The technique – identifies and maps local natural resources (“Area Source”) in suitability maps – of where sustainable methods work (or are needed), that can serve as alternatives (to more resource intensive methods). All interventions – are place-sensitive (in that: their design materiality and engineering – is suited, to that location). Second, “&lt;u&gt;Point Resources&lt;/u&gt;,” (examples: of a successful past (or present) use, of a given resource) – are sought central, to an area resource. The flow linkages (“Network Resources”) between these examples (of people that have had success, in using the suitability areas) – defined above provide the final map, in the Area Point Resource Network. The Network Resources map – tracks four flows: 

* ''information;''
* ''currency;''
* ''energy;''
* ''materials''. 

The overlay of the three resource types – reveals a functional web; that – coordinates resource movement, with built-in feedback mechanisms. 

Additionally: a void at any hub of the web – reveals a missing resource (and – an opportunity: to improve the function, of the regional network). &lt;ref&gt;Fisk III, P. A Conceptual Approach Toward the Development of Appropriate Technology, Science and Technology: New Tools, New Dimensions, American Association for the Advancement of Science 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmpbs.org/publications/MP1.13-Concept_Appro.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919031710/http://cmpbs.org/publications/MP1.13-Concept_Appro.pdf |archivedate=September 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BaseLineGreen===
Baseline Green – is a methodology (initially – funded through a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) to design and engineer environmentally (and economically) sophisticated buildings, using national data for approximately 12 million businesses (in the continental U.S.). The approach – was developed between '''1995''' and '''2000''', – and connects four fundamental tools: 

# Baselining environmental impacts (of 489 industrial categories) – within the U.S. economy (including 39 building construction sectors), according to region;
# Correlating: Construction Specification Institute – and – ASTM categorization systems;
# Depicting impacts graphically – of all major facets of building and support utilities;
# Showing in GIS format: where the generic condition effects local environmental and/or economies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmpbs.org/publications/T1.7-BaselineGreen.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213194402/http://cmpbs.org/publications/T1.7-BaselineGreen.pdf |archivedate=December 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baseline Green framework – is a synthesis: of environmental &lt;u&gt;Life Cycle Assessment&lt;/u&gt; (LCA), &lt;u&gt;economic input/output modeling&lt;/u&gt; – and &lt;u&gt;[[Geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]]&lt;/u&gt; (GIS). The methodology – is applicable at multiple construction scales: from single family residential – to large-scale commercial. The procedure – compares the upstream environmental costs (of a standard construction material) with its market cost (in dollars) – to determine the material’s “external environmental cost ratio.” The “&lt;u&gt;employment impact ratio&lt;/u&gt;” (EIR) – is a ratio: of employment (generated by a material) t o its market value. &lt;ref&gt;MacMath, Richard and Pliny Fisk III. BaseLine Green and GreenBalance: A Step Beyond Sustainability in Building Performance, 1998, http://www.cmpbs.org/publications/Tools/documents/BASELINEGREEN_GREENBALANCEforweb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon Dioxide Intensity Ratios (CDIR)===
A &lt;u&gt;carbon dioxide intensity ratio&lt;/u&gt; (a concept, developed in '''1998''') – is the ratio: between the net upstream CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; impact (emissions, minus storage) of a material – and the weight (of that material). A material with a ''positive'' CDIR – is a net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; source; and one with a ''negative'' CDIR – is a net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sink. CDIR – offers an opportunity: to quantify the long-term impact, of conservation efforts. Accompanying construction standards – could help ensure: forest products – retain their carbon, by using specific construction and disposal practices. &lt;ref&gt;MacMath, Richard and Pliny Fisk III. Carbon Dioxide Intensity Ratios: A Method of Evaluating the Upstream Global Warming Impact of Long-Life Building Materials, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmpbs.org/publications/T1.2-AD4.5-Up_Gbl_wrm.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920100748/http://www.cmpbs.org/publications/T1.2-AD4.5-Up_Gbl_wrm.pdf |archivedate=September 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EcoBalance Planning and the EcoBalance Sustainable Land Use Planning Game===
&lt;u&gt;EcoBalance&lt;/u&gt; – is a sustainable land-use planning (and design method), that employs the principle of life-cycles as a framework – for sustaining basic life-supporting systems.&lt;ref name="austinchronicle1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lebkowsky |first=Jon |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid:613622 |title=The Serious Play in Saving the World: Gaming gets on the sustainability bandwagon - Screens |publisher=The Austin Chronicle |date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used, as a means to address the need for planning of physical space (both: within buildings – and surrounding land). The &lt;u&gt;EcoBalance&lt;/u&gt; method – asserts that: ''sustainability'' – is measurable (by the degree, to which – human needs are balanced, – with our ability: to manage the environment, using nature-augmenting technologies).

During the &lt;u&gt;EcoBalance&lt;/u&gt; planning process, – space uses – are determined and analyzed, according to the footprints (that – are necessary: to supply the basic human life support requirements – of ''air, water, food, energy and materials'' – in a regenerative fashion). The framework for EcoBalance planning – remains essentially the same (regardless of project scale), with the process typically directed toward the building, site, and master planning scales. The objective (during the planning process) – is to understand the limits of human activities: by carefully managing those activities’ resource use. In addition, the degree (to which – limits are exceeded) – is shared with the next scalar boundary; either on or off the building boundary (or – site).

Measurement of sustainability – is an integral part of the planning and design process, – and is illustrated, in multiple forms, – such as:

# the ratio: between the amount of life support '''supplied''' (by the space: being analyzed) – and the amount of life support '''needed''' (by humans: occupying that space);
# the ratio: of the sourcing '''requirements''' (of the physical space) – and the resourcing '''capacity''' (of the same space);
# the ratio: of life-support needs supplied '''on'''-site – and those supplied '''off'''-site.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk III, Pliny, and Lovleen Gill-Aulakh.

* topography, 
* soil types, 
* geology, 
* hydrology, 
* vegetation, 
* site improvements, 
* and special features. 

Each base map topic – may include sub-topics, such as: digital elevation model, slope, – and aspect sub-topics under topography. Each of the Base Maps – is a separate document; that can be overlaid on an aerial photo of the site and on other Base Maps. A set of five game principles – is generally used to guide play, as follows:

#Life-cycle assessment methodology;
#Ecological footprinting;
#Scales (varying generic boundaries, – within which – the planning game can be played);
#Resource balancing;

{{Catholic Church Hierarchy}}
{{canon law}}

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], '''protonotary apostolic'''  ('''PA'''; [[Latin]]: ''protonotarius apostolicus'') is the title for a member of the highest non-episcopal college of [[prelate]]s in the [[Roman Curia]] or, outside Rome, an honorary prelate on whom the [[Pope]] has conferred this title and its special privileges. An example is [[Prince Georg of Bavaria]] (1880–1943), who became in 1926 Protonotary by papal decree.

==History==
In later antiquity, there were in [[Rome]] seven regional [[Civil law notary|notaries]] who, on the further development of the papal administration and the accompanying increase of the notaries, remained the supreme palace notaries of the papal chancery (''notarii apostolici'' or ''protonotarii''). In the Middle Ages, the protonotaries were very high papal officials and were often raised directly from this office to the [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]ate. Originally numbering seven, [[Pope Sixtus V]] (1585–90) increased their number to twelve. Their importance gradually diminished, and at the time of the [[French Revolution]], the office had almost entirely disappeared. On 8 February 1838, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] re-established the college of real protonotaries with seven members called ''protonotarii de numero participantium'', also known as ''numerary protonotaries'', because they shared in the revenues, as officials of the Roman [[Apostolic Chancery|Chancery]].

Since the sixteenth century, the popes had also appointed honorary protonotaries, who enjoyed the same privileges as the seven real members of the college; and titular protonotaries, who held a corresponding position in the administration of the episcopal ordinariate or in the collegiate chapter. By the [[motu proprio]] ''Inter multiplices'' of 21 February 1905, [[Pope Pius X]] defined the position of the protonotaries: privileges, dress, and insignia of the members of the four classes: 
*the ''protonotarii apostolici de numero participantium'', members 'within the number' of the college of prelates, who exercised their office in connection with the acts of consistories and canonizations, had a representative in the Congregation of the Propaganda, and, according to the reorganization of the Curia by the Constitution "Sapienti consilio" of 29 June 1908, signed the papal Bulls instead of the earlier [[abbreviatores]]. They enjoyed the use of pontificals and numerous privileges, and also, after examining the candidates, named annually a fixed number of doctors of theology and of canon law; 
*the ''protonotarii apostolici supranumerarii'', a dignity to which only the canons of the four Roman patriarchal [[basilica major]]s (the Lateran, St. Peter's, and St. Mary Major, St. Paul Outside the Walls), and of cathedral chapters outside Rome to which the privilege had been granted, could be raised; 
*the ''protonotarii apostolici ad instar (sc. participantium)'', who were appointed by the pope and had the same external insignia as the real protonotaries; 
*the ''protonotarii titulares seu honorarii'', who were found outside Rome, and who received this dignity from the [[nuncio]]s or as a special privilege.

==Present practice==
Since 1969 (following [[Pope Paul VI]]'s issuing of two motus proprios, ''[[Pontificalis Domus]]'' of March 28, 1968 and ''Pontificalia Insignia'' of June 21, 1968), the four classes are reduced to two:
*Apostolic protonotaries ''de numero''—who continue the work of the College of Protonotaries and still have certain duties with regard to papal documents; they may be addressed formally as "Most Reverend Sir or Monsignor (in Italian: Reverendissimo Signore, Monsignore)", and they may wear the [[mantelletta]], the purple [[choir cassock]] and [[rochet]] for liturgical services, the black [[cassock]] with red piping and purple [[Fascia (sash)|fascia]] at other times, and may add the purple [[ferraiuolo]] and the [[biretta]] with red tuft to the black cassock for formal ceremonies of a non-liturgical nature (e.g., a graduation).
*Apostolic protonotaries supernumerary—The title is awarded to priests by the [[pope]], however the title is purely honorary and is not attached to any duties in the Curia—this is the type of [[protonotary]] found outside Rome, and it is considered the highest grade of [[monsignor]] found in most dioceses. Priests so honored are addressed as "reverend monsignor", may put the [[post-nominal letters]] "P.A." after their names, may wear the purple choir cassock (with rochet) for liturgical services, the black cassock with red piping and purple sash at other times, and may add the purple ferraiuolo to this for formal non-liturgical ceremonies, but use none of the other accoutrements mentioned above. This title will no longer be bestowed by the Pope as of 2014, but all existing supernumerary protonotaries are allowed to keep their titles.

The name of the [[prothonotary warbler]] derives from the supposed similarity between its plumage and the golden robes worn by protonotaries.

A '''Public Committee''' ({{lang-he|ועדה ציבורית}}) is a committee appointed by the [[Israeli Cabinet]], or by other various governmental bodies in Israel, and at times with the cooperation of other Israeli public bodies, in order to objectively explore a matter on the public agenda.

Public Committees are appointed to review a public matter that requires legislation such as tax reform and formulate recommendations, to review the conduct of a public body, formulating recommendations to prevent a repetition of such misconducts, and draw conclusions on the figures responsible for it or to award a prize.

Committee are granted a letter of appointment by the responsible minister that details the committee's chair and members, its objectives and timetable.

Each committee receives a descriptive name that reflects its goal. They usually become known by the chair's name, such as the [[Shamgar Commission]], and most recently, the [[Turkel Commission]].

The committee issues a comprehensive report that summarizes its findings and recommendations. Deadlines are not always met, and at times the committee produces an interim report. Usually, reports are available for public review. At times, when national security is at stake, the report is divided into confidential and public sections. Committee recommendations may or may not be binding.

Four types of committees are appointed by law:
*[[National Commission of Inquiry (Israel)|National Commission of Inquiry]] – Established according to the  ''National Commission of Inquiry 1968'', or the ''[[State Comptroller of Israel|State Comptroller]]'s law 1958''
*[[Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry (Israel)|Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry]] – Established according to the ''[[Basic Laws of Israel|Basic law: the Knesset]]''
*[[Government Revision Committee (Israel)|Government Revision Committee]] – Established according to the ''Government law - 2001''&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with the [[Basic Laws of Israel|Basic law: the Government]]&lt;/ref&gt; (as the most recent [[Turkel Commission]] was established).
*[[IDF Inquiry Commission]] – Established according to the ''Military-Justice law 1955''.

Most Public Committees are dismantled after completing their work. At times, a Public Committees are established for long term objectives, or for regular activities, such as the Government official's senior positions Committee and the [[Government Appellation Committee (Israel)|Government Appellation Committee]] ({{lang-he|ועדת השמות}}, ''Va'adat HaShemot'')

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8482">'''Securities regulation in the United States''' is the field of [[Law of the United States|U.S. law]] that covers transactions and other dealings with [[Security (finance)|securities]]. The term is usually understood to include both federal- and state-level regulation by purely governmental regulatory agencies, but sometimes may also encompass listing requirements of [[stock exchange|exchanges]] like the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and rules of [[self-regulatory organization]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s like the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA).

On the federal level, the primary securities regulator is the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC). [[Futures contract|Futures]] and some aspects of [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] are regulated by the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC).

==Overview==
FINRA, a [[self-regulatory organization]], promulgates rules that govern [[broker-dealers]] and certain other professionals in the securities industry. It was formed when the enforcement divisions of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), now [[FINRA]], and of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] merged into one organization. FINRA, like the stock exchanges and the [[Securities Investor Protection Corporation]] (SIPC), is overseen by the SEC, and in general FINRA's rules are subject to SEC approval.

All brokers and dealers registered with the SEC under {{USC|15|78o}}, with some exceptions, are required to be members of SIPC (pursuant to {{USC|15|78ccc}}) and are subject to its regulations.

The federal securities laws were largely created as part of the [[New Deal]] in the 1930s. There are five major federal securities laws:

# [[Securities Act of 1933]] – regulating distribution of new securities
# [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] – regulating trading securities, brokers, and exchanges
# [[Trust Indenture Act of 1939]] – regulating debt securities
# [[Investment Company Act of 1940]] – regulating [[mutual funds]]
# [[Investment Advisers Act of 1940]] – regulating investment advisers

Since these laws were originally enacted, Congress has amended them many times. The Holding Company Act and the Trust Indenture Act in particular have changed significantly since then. The titles listed above, including the year of original enactment, are the so-called "popular names" of these laws, and practitioners in this area reference these statutes using these popular names (e.g., "Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act" or "Section 5 of the Securities Act"). When they do so, they do not generally mean the provisions of the original Acts; they mean the Acts as amended to date.

When Congress amends the securities laws, those amendments have their own popular names (a few prominent examples include [[Securities Investor Protection Act|Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970]], the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984, the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 and the [[Dodd-Frank Act]]). These acts often include provisions that state that they are amending one of the five primary laws. Other laws passed since then include [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]] (1995), [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] (2002), [[Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act]] (2012), and various other [[:Category:United States federal securities legislation|federal securities laws]].

Although practitioners in this area use these popular names to refer to the federal securities laws, like many U.S. statutes these laws are generally codified in the U.S. Code, the official codification of U.S. statutory law. They are contained in Title 15 of the U.S. Code. Thus, for example, the official code citation for Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 is 15 U.S.C. section 77e. Not every law adopted by Congress is codified, because some are not appropriate for codification. For example, appropriations statutes are not codified.

There are also extensive regulations under these laws, largely made by the SEC. One of the most famous and often used SEC rules is Rule 10b-5, which prohibits fraud in securities transactions as well as insider trading. Because interpretations under rule 10b-5 often deem silence to be fraudulent in certain circumstances, efforts to comply with Rule 10b-5 and avoid lawsuits under 10b-5 have been responsible for a large amount of corporate disclosure.

The federal securities laws govern the offer and sale of securities and the trading of securities, activities of certain professionals in the industry, investment companies (such as mutual funds), tender offers, proxy statements, and generally the regulation of public companies. Public company regulation is largely a disclosure-driven regime, but it has grown in recent years to the point that it begins to dictate certain issues of corporate governance.

State laws governing issuance and trading of securities are commonly referred to as [[blue sky law]]s.

==History==
Before the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], there was little regulation of securities in the United States at the federal level. The crash spurred  Congress to hold hearings, known as the [[Pecora Commission]], after [[Ferdinand Pecora]].

After the hearings Congress passed the [[Securities Act of 1933]] prescribing rules for the interstate sales of securities, and made it illegal to sell securities in a state without complying with that state's laws. The statute requires a [[publicly-traded company]] to register with the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC). The registration statement provides a broad range of information about the company and is a public record. The SEC does not approve or disapprove the [[initial public offering|issue of securities]], but rather permits the filing statement to "become effective" if sufficient required detail is provided, including risk factors. The company can then begin selling the stock issue, usually through investment bankers.

The following year, Congress passed the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], to regulate the [[secondary market]] (general-public) trading of securities. Initially, the 1934 Act applied only to [[stock exchange]]s and their listed companies, as the name implies. In the late 1930s, it was amended to provide regulation of the [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) market (i.e., trades between individuals with no stock exchange involved). In 1964, the Act was amended to apply to companies traded in the OTC market.

Courts interpreted the laws, assembling a body of [[:Category:United_States_securities_case_law|United States securities case law]]. In 1988 the Supreme Court of the United States decided ''[[Basic Inc. v. Levinson]]'', which allowed [[class action]] lawsuits under [[SEC Rule 10b-5]] and the "fraud-on-the-market" theory, which resulted in an increase in securities class actions.&lt;ref name=Pritchard2008/&gt; The [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]] and the state model law Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act was a response to class actions.&lt;ref name=Pritchard2008&gt;Pritchard A. (2008). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1159983 Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.: The Political Economy of Securities Class Action Reform]. ''Cato Supreme Court Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2000, the SEC issued the [[Regulation Fair Disclosure]] regulation (Reg FD), which required publicly traded companies to disclose [[material information]] to all investors at the same time. Reg FD helped level the playing field for all investors by helping to reduce the problem of [[selective disclosure]].

In 2010, the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] was passed to reform securities law in the wake of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]].

A '''Silver Alert''' is a public notification system in the United States to broadcast information about [[missing person]]s – especially [[senior citizen]]s with [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[dementia]], or other mental disabilities – in order to aid in locating them.

Silver Alerts use a wide array of media outlets – such as commercial [[radio station]]s, [[television station]]s, and [[cable television]] – to broadcast information about missing persons. In some states (specifically [[Arizona]], [[Florida]], [[New Jersey]], [[Texas]], and [[Wisconsin]]), Silver Alerts also use [[variable-message sign]]s on roadways to alert motorists to be on the lookout for missing seniors. In cases in which a missing person is believed to be missing on foot, Silver Alerts have used [[Reverse 911]] or other [[emergency notification system]]s to notify nearby residents of the neighborhood surrounding the missing person's last known location. Silver alerts can also be used for children who are missing without being in danger or abducted. 

Supporters of Silver Alert point to the U.S.A's growing elderly population as a reason to support new programs to locate missing seniors. Approximately six in ten dementia victims will wander off at least once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Johnson |first= Kirk |title= More with Dementia Wander from Home |work=The New York Times |date= May 4, 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/05/us/05search.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; If not found within 24 hours, up to half of 
wandering seniors with dementia suffer serious injury or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/stages-behaviors/wandering |title= Wandering |quote= Six in 10 people with dementia will wander [Three out of five people with Alzheimer's Disease will wander] |publisher= Alzheimer's Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activation criteria==
Activation criteria for Silver Alerts vary from state to state. Some states limit Silver Alerts to persons over the age of 65 who have been medically diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, or a mental disability. Other states expand Silver Alert to include all children and adults with mental or developmental disabilities. In general, the decision to issue a Silver Alert is made by the law enforcement agency investigating the report of a missing person. Public information in a Silver Alert usually consists of the name and description of the missing person and a description of the missing person's vehicle and [[license plate]] number, e.g. ''David Smith GRN 2002 [[Oldsmobile Bravada]] FL LIC 989 ARN''.

== History ==
In December 2005, Oklahoma state Representative [[Fred Perry (politician)|Fred Perry]] (R-Tulsa) announced his intention to introduce an "[[AMBER Alert]] for seniors", which he dubbed "Silver Alert."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In Georgia, public efforts to locate missing seniors increased following the April 2004 disappearance of Mattie Moore, a 68-year-old Atlanta resident with Alzheimer's disease. Eight months after Moore's disappearance, her body was found 500 yards (460 m) from her home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In Florida,  Mary Zelter, an 86-year-old resident of Largo, drove away from her assisted-living facility on February 26, 2008, and never returned. Her body was found a week later {{convert|10|mi|km}} away in the Intracoastal Waterway near a Clearwater boat ramp. Her submerged car was nearby. This tragedy prompted Pinellas County officials to create a Silver Alert pilot program that later grew into a statewide initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Federal legislation===
In May 2008, Representative [[Lloyd Doggett]] introduced the National Silver Alert Act in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], a bill to encourage, enhance, and integrate Silver Alert plans throughout the United States. Similar legislation was filed by Representatives [[Gus Bilirakis]] (R-FL) and [[Sue Myrick]] (R-NC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Rep. Bilirakis Introduces Bill Creating Silver Alert Grant Program | publisher = Office of Rep. Gus Bilirakis | date= April 24, 2008  | url=http://bilirakis.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=308&amp;Itemid=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Myrick introduces Kristen's Act Reauthorization of 2005  | publisher = Office of U.S. Rep. Sue Myrick | date= May 4, 2005 | url=http://www.house.gov/list/press/nc09_myrick/kristensact05050405.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three bills were combined into a single bill, H.R. 6064.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = H.R. 6064 | publisher = THOMAS Legislative Database, Library of Congress | url =http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/R?cp110:FLD010:@1(hr825)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was passed by the House in September 2008 by a [[voice vote]], but the [[110th Congress]] adjourned before it could be considered in the [[U.S. Senate]].

The National Silver Alert Act was re-introduced in the [[111th Congress]] as H.R. 632. It was passed by the House of Representatives on February 11, 2009, on a voice vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = H.R. 632 | publisher = THOMAS Legislative Database, Library of Congress | url =http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR00632:@@@X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Companion legislation (S.557) was introduced in the Senate by Senator [[Mel Martinez]] (R-FL) and Senator [[Herb Kohl]] (D-WI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Martinez Introduces 'Silver Alert' System to Help Locate Missing Persons | publisher = Office of Senator Mel Martinez | date = September 25, 2008 | url = http://martinez.senate.gov/public/?p=NewsReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=8e46fdaa-f732-468b-9f73-99b90adc2f1b&amp;ContentType_id=1d62f91e-b8b8-44a9-8175-202346eb6e9e&amp;MonthDisplay=9&amp;YearDisplay=2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090625005408/http://martinez.senate.gov/public/?p=NewsReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=8e46fdaa-f732-468b-9f73-99b90adc2f1b&amp;ContentType_id=1d62f91e-b8b8-44a9-8175-202346eb6e9e&amp;MonthDisplay=9&amp;YearDisplay=2008 | archivedate = June 25, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reintroduced by Senator [[Joe Manchin]] (D-WV) on December 12, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Manchin, Rockefeller, Coons, Schumer, McCaskill, Klobuchar Introduce Silver Alert Bill to Help Locate Missing Seniors | publisher = Office of Senator Joe Manchin | date = December 17, 2013 | url = http://www.manchin.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2013/12/manchin-rockefeller-coons-schumer-mccaskill-klobuchar-introduce-silver-alert-bill-to-help-locate-missing-seniors | access-date = December 23, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131224095046/http://www.manchin.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2013/12/manchin-rockefeller-coons-schumer-mccaskill-klobuchar-introduce-silver-alert-bill-to-help-locate-missing-seniors | archive-date = December 24, 2013 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Silver Alert Act has been endorsed by the [[Assisted Living Federation of America]] (ALFA), [[Alzheimer's Association]], [[Alzheimer's Foundation of America]], [[Elder Justice Coalition]], [[National Silver Haired Congress]], the [[National Association of Police Organizations]] and the [[National Sheriffs' Association]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Criticism==
Critics of Silver Alert have raised concerns that the proliferation of color-coded alerts will reduce their importance, risking that alerts would be ignored as a "[[wolf cry]]". For example, Texas has created an Amber Alert, Silver Alert and Blue Alert (issued to locate an assailant in the event a law enforcement officer is killed or injured.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Texas Department of Public Safety |title=AMBER Alert |url=http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/dem/pages/amberalertprogram.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705212001/http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/dem/pages/amberalertprogram.htm |archivedate=July 5, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York, Governor [[George Pataki]] vetoed Silver Alert legislation in 2003, citing his concern that it would weaken the Amber Alert system and make the alerts too common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Friedman  | first = Emily  | title = Silver Alerts Help Find Disoriented Elderly  | publisher = [[ABC News]]  | date = December 23, 2008 | url =http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/SmartHome/Story?id=6513437&amp;page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of state-level legislation, local Silver Alert programs have been enacted by New York City&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = New Silver Alert Law Enhances Public Notification System to Aid Search for Missing Seniors | publisher = New York City Department of Aging | date = October 6, 2010 | url = http://www.nyc.gov/html/dfta/downloads/pdf/silver_alert.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101217184633/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dfta/downloads/pdf/silver_alert.pdf | archivedate = December 17, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and five New York counties: Rockland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = 'Silver Alert' System to Safeguard Seniors | publisher = New City Patch | date = May 3, 2010 | url = http://newcity.patch.com/articles/silver-alert-system-to-safeguard-seniors}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suffolk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Suffolk Executive Levy Signs "Silver Alert System" Initiative | publisher = Suffolk County Government | date = March 12, 2009 | url = http://www.co.suffolk.ny.us/departments/CountyExec/2009%20Press%20Releases/Silver%20Alert%20System.aspx | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110101134350/http://www.co.suffolk.ny.us/departments/CountyExec/2009%20Press%20Releases/Silver%20Alert%20System.aspx | archivedate = January 1, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nassau,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Nassau OKs Silver Alert system for elderly wanderers  | publisher = ''Newsday'' (New York)| date = August 10, 2009 | url = http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/nassau-oks-silver-alert-system-for-elderly-wanderers-1.1361172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niagara&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Sheriff unveils Silver Alert system for missing seniors  | publisher = Buffalo News | date = August 21, 2010 | url = http://www.buffalonews.com/city/communities/niagara-county/article48096.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Erie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Silver Alerts coming to Erie County  | publisher = Buffalo News | date = November 5, 2010 | url = http://www.buffalonews.com/incoming/article242610.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics have raised concerns about the cost of implementing the Silver Alert program on a nationwide basis. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] has estimated that implementation of the National Silver Alert Act would cost $59 million over a five-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Congressional Budget Office |title=Cost Estimate, H.R. 6064, National Silver Alert Act |date=September 4, 2008 |url= http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/97xx/doc9725/hr6064.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the House debate on the cost Representative [[Ted Poe]] (R-TX) noted that states with Silver Alerts have reported nominal costs associated with operating the system, since they are able to utilize existing Amber Alert infrastructure to issue Silver Alerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives |title=Congressional Record |url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2009_record&amp;page=H1126&amp;position=all |date=February 10, 2009 |page= H1126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retrieval rate==
Because the implementation of Silver Alert systems vary from state to state, there are no national statistics for the retrieval rates resulting from Silver Alerts. However, among states that publicly release statistics, retrieval rates indicate a high level of success. For example, In North Carolina, 128 Silver Alerts were issued in 2008. Of these, 118 seniors were safely recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Silver Alert Activations Summary  | publisher = North Carolina Department of Crime Control and Public Safety  | date = March 4, 2009  | url = http://www.nccrimecontrol.org/Index2.cfm?a=000003,000005,000081,000251  | access-date = June 27, 2009  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090724202625/https://www.nccrimecontrol.org/Index2.cfm?a=000003,000005,000081,000251  | archive-date = July 24, 2009  | dead-url = yes  | df = mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Georgia, Mattie's Call garnered a safe return for 70 of the 71 calls issued between its inception in 2006 and January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Toone  | first = Stephanie  | title = System successful in finding lost adults  | publisher = Augusta Chronicle  | date = January 10, 2009 | url = http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2009/01/10/met_507153.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Texas, the Silver Alert system was invoked 52 times in the first year following its inception in September 2007. Of these alerts, 48 of the missing seniors were located safely, and 13 of these recoveries were directly attributable to Silver Alert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives |title=Congressional Record |url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2008_record&amp;page=H8081&amp;position=all |date=September 15, 2008 |page= H8081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Florida, 136  Silver Alerts were issued in its first year (2008–2009), leading to 131 safe recoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 136 Silver Alerts issued in system's 1st year  | website = Miami Herald  | date = December 25, 2009 | url = http://www.miamiherald.com/news/florida/AP/story/1398282.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19 of these recoveries were directly attributable to Silver Alert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Florida Department of Law Enforcement |title=Silver Alert Monthly Report, November 2009 |url=http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/Content/getdoc/c65155a7-9876-4319-aa5d-abc920ff37c6/Silver-Alert-MAY-09.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208213530/http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/Content/getdoc/c65155a7-9876-4319-aa5d-abc920ff37c6/Silver-Alert-MAY-09.aspx |archivedate=February 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over two years, 227 Silver Alerts have been issued in Florida – with 220 seniors located safely, and 36 of those recoveries attributed directly to the Silver Alert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=TheGovMonitor.com |date=October 8, 2010 |title=Florida Celebrates Two Year Anniversary Of Silver Alert Program |url=http://www.thegovmonitor.com/world_news/united_states/florida-celebrates-two-year-anniversary-of-silver-alert-program-40171.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009203653/http://www.thegovmonitor.com/world_news/united_states/florida-celebrates-two-year-anniversary-of-silver-alert-program-40171.html |archivedate=October 9, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over three years, 377 Silver Alerts have been issued in Florida, with 367 seniors located safely, and 51 of those recoveries attributed directly to the Silver Alert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=wtxl.com |date=October 7, 2011 |title=Three Year Anniversary Of Florida's Silver Alert Plan |url=http://www.wtxl.com/content/state/story/Three-year-anniversary-of-Floridas-Silver-Alert/8JsMw9wFdUGP1OB37K-7gw.cspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120421062521/http://www.wtxl.com/content/state/story/Three-year-anniversary-of-Floridas-Silver-Alert/8JsMw9wFdUGP1OB37K-7gw.cspx |archivedate=April 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taobao''' ({{zh|s=淘宝网}}) is a Chinese [[online shopping]] website, headquartered in [[Hangzhou]], and owned by [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]]. It is the world's biggest [[e-commerce]] website, as well as the eighth most visited website in the world according to [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 500 Most Popular Websites globally for 2018 {{!}} WebHostFace Hosting Services|url=https://www.alexa.com/topsites|work=Alexa|date=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 31 March 2018, Taobao has over 617 million monthly active users &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/taobao-statistics/|title=25 Amazing Taobao Statistics|last=|first=|date=20 August 2018|website=DMR|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded by Alibaba Group in 2003, Taobao Marketplace facilitates [[consumer-to-consumer]] (C2C) retail by providing a platform for small businesses and individual entrepreneurs to open online stores that mainly cater to consumers in Chinese-speaking regions (Mainland China, [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]]) and also abroad.&lt;ref name="launch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Jianqing|author2=Ming Fan|author3=Mingzhi Li|title=Advertising versus Brokerage Model for Online Trading Platforms|journal=MIS Quarterly|year=2016|volume=40|issue=3|pages=575–596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sellers are able to post goods for sale either through a fixed price or [[auction]]. Auctions make up a small percentage of [[Financial transaction|transaction]]s. The majority of the products are new merchandise sold at fixed prices. Buyers can assess seller backgrounds by information available on the site, including ratings, comments and complaints.

On 29 March 2016, Alibaba group CEO Zhang Yong claimed a clear strategy for the future of Taobao: community, content, and local life, the three directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2016-03-29/doc-ifxqswxk9789646.shtml |script-title=zh:张勇为淘宝定了三大方向:社区、内容和本地生活|date=2016-03-29|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Taobao Marketplace (formerly "Taobao") was launched in May 2003 by Alibaba after eBay acquired [[Eachnet]], China's online auction leader at the time, for US$180 million and became a major player in the Chinese consumer [[e-commerce]] market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="eBay China Rumors". Search Engine Journal. September 26, 2006.|url=http://www.searchenginejournal.com/ebay-china-rumors/3839/}}&lt;/ref&gt; To counter eBay's expansion, Taobao offered free listings to sellers and introduced website features designed to act in local consumers' best interests, such as [[instant messaging]] for facilitating buyer-seller communication and an [[escrow]]-based payment tool, [[Alipay (payment platform)|Alipay]]. As a result, Taobao became mainland China's undisputed market leader within two years. Its market share surged from 8% to 59% between 2003 and 2005, while eBay China plunged from 79% to 36%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="China's pied piper". The Economist. September 21, 2006|url=http://www.economist.com/node/7942225?story_id=7942225|publisher=The Economist | date=September 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; EBay shut down its China site in 2006.

In April 2008, Taobao introduced a newly dedicated B2C platform called [[Taobao Mall]] to complement its C2C marketplace. Taobao Mall established itself as the destination for quality brand name goods for Chinese consumers. Taobao Mall launched an independent web domain, [[Tmall]].com, and enhanced its focus on product verticals and improvements in shopping experience in November 2010. It became an independent business in June 2011 and changed its Chinese name to Tian Mao ([[Tmall]]) in January 2012. As of October 2013 it was the eighth most visited web site in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexa.com Tmall.com Access Statistics|url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/tmall.com#trafficstats|work=Alexa.com|publisher=Alexa.com|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Taobao fueled the overall growth of the Chinese online shopping industry through execution of the “Big Taobao” strategy with the aim of becoming a provider of e-commerce infrastructure services for all e-commerce market participants.

In October 2010, Taobao beta launched eTao as an independent searching engine for online shopping, providing product and merchant information from a number of major consumer e-commerce websites in China. Online shoppers can use the site to compare prices from different sellers and identify products to buy. According to the Alibaba Group web site, eTao offers products from Amazon China, [[Dangdang]], Gome, Yihaodian, Nike China and Vancl, as well as Taobao and [[Tmall]].&lt;ref name="Alibaba Group Company Overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alibaba Group Company Overview|url=http://news.alibaba.com/specials/aboutalibaba/aligroup/index.html|work=Alibaba Group|publisher=Alibaba Group|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, Alibaba Group opened a retail store in Beijing under the Taobao Mall brand. The five-story 25,000sqm Taobao Mall iFengChao Furniture Showroom opened as a complement to their online stores.

In June 2011, [[Alibaba Group]] Executive Chairman and former CEO [[Jack Ma]] announced that Taobao would split into three different companies: Taobao Marketplace (a C2C platform), Tmall.com (a B2C platform; then called Taobao Mall), and eTao (a search engine for online shopping). The move was said to be necessary for Taobao to “meet competitive threats that emerged in the past two years during which the Internet and e-commerce landscape has changed dramatically.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-06-16/alibaba-group-to-split-taobao-online-shopping-mall-into-three-companies|title=Alibaba Group to Split Taobao Online Retail Unit Into Three|publisher=|accessdate=12 May 2017|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2012 onward, Taobao began to accept international [[Visa, Inc.|Visa]] and [[MasterCard]] [[credit card|credit]] and [[debit card]]s;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taobao.com/go/chn/oversea/taobao_accept_oversea_credit_card_2012.php 淘宝全面接受海外信用卡付款], Taobao.com&lt;/ref&gt; prior, only domestic banks were supported by AliPay.&lt;ref&gt;2011-10-19, [http://finance.ifeng.com/roll/20111019/4871239.shtml 支付宝将向全球开放 国外用户可购物淘宝], [[Phoenix TV]] Finance&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 2013, Alibaba announced an investment of US$586 million in [[Sina Weibo]]. According to Reuters, the deal “should drive more web traffic to Alibaba's Taobao Marketplace, China's largest e-commerce website with a consumer focus.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alibaba pushes into social networking with Weibo investment|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/29/net-us-sinaweibo-alibaba-stake-idUSBRE93S0DA20130429|work=Reuters|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 1, 2013, Alibaba launched Weibo for Taobao, which allows users to link Sina Weibo accounts with Taobao accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinainternetwatch.com/2767/alibaba-released-weibo-for-taobao-with-sina/ Alibaba Released Weibo for Taobao with Sina] China Internet Watch, August 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services and features ==

=== Mascot ===

Taobao's mascot is an [[ant]], which represents their corporate culture. Ma introduced Taobao to the outside world by stating, "We are the ant army." Ma once organized more than 2,000 employees at a gymnasium to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the founding ceremony. At the party, Taobao employees waved the Taobao mascot — the flag of "ants." At the end of the celebration that lasted for four hours, all the employees stood hand-in-hand, singing "If you do not experience wind and rain, you cannot see the rainbow. The ants that be organized together can beat the elephant."

=== Shop feedback ===

To thoroughly investigate a Taobao shop, a good way is to view its feedback by clicking the shop's rating icon. For Tmall.com shops, people click the stars to view their ratings. Taobao users usually spend time to read feedback and compare items of one shop with those of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to read taobao shop feedbacks?". NewBuyBay Taobao Agent. January 13, 2013|url=http://www.newbuybay.com/Article/ArtView/126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feedback put up by the user can be genuine or made up which users have to thoroughly read through to conclude. If the feedback style and tone is same, likely, it's made up. Some of the feedback can also be posted by competitors. Users have to look at the majority of the feedback to deduce whether the feedback are genuine. The best way to conclude whether the item is truly worth buying is to look at the available feedback that are posted by users after they've used the item for a period of time.

For every trade deal on Taobao, there must be a section of customer feedback, which is a determination factor of the sale volume for the shop. Therefore, the shop owners often put effort to maximize the positive comments and eliminate the negative ones. Even profitable negotiations happen between sellers and the consumers for rating their satisfactions toward the commodity and their shopping experiences. 
In order to collect public perspectives towards Taobao services, searching tools and other functions are used to determine and learn the users’ demands, which could help Taobao make more improvements; There are also surveys handed out to Taobao consumers including the following parts:

·The obstacles that you encounter while using the product.

·Your advises and reviews of the product.

·The frequencies of your uses on the product, or the importance of that particular product to the users themselves.

·The satisfaction level towards the specific aspects, including visual and typographic layout, procedure and instruction guide.

·The overall satisfaction level towards the product.

=== Alipay ===
{{main article|Alipay}}
Launched in 2004, Alipay ({{zh|s=支付宝|t=支付寶|p=Zhīfùbǎo}}), an [[escrow]]-based [[online payment]] platform, is the preferred payment solution for transactions on Taobao Marketplace. It is the most widely used third-party online payment solution in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alibaba is building its Alipay payments service into the PayPal of the East|url=https://thenextweb.com/asia/2013/10/17/alibaba-is-building-its-alipay-payments-service-into-the-paypal-of-the-east/|work=The Next Web|publisher=The Next Web|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure safe transactions, Alipay uses an escrow system through which payment is only released to the seller once the buyer has received his or her goods in satisfactory condition. According to the Alibaba Group web site, Alipay is partnered with multiple financial institutions as well as Visa and MasterCard to facilitate payments in China and abroad.&lt;ref name="Alibaba Group Company Overview" /&gt; 

Alipay systems are separate for different groups of users. For instance, Alipay users may send and receive funds if they have an account that added a credit card issued in China, whereas users who use credit cards issued outside China may only use Alipay to pay for goods or services from Taobao. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294211-i642-k5228085-Recharge_a_China_Mobile_pre_pay_account_outside_of_China-China.html|title=Recharge a China Mobile pre-pay account outside of China? - China Forum - TripAdvisor|website=www.tripadvisor.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has proven problematic for international users of Taobao, as they are unable to receive refunds that are not issued via the Taobao system.

Regulatory changes issued by the People's Bank of China (Central Bank of China) are set to alter the Chinese online payment ecosystem forever. Top-tier digital payment services such as WeChat Pay and Alipay are expected to transfer all relevant transaction data to appropriate agencies starting June 30th, 2018.

Now, because of the huge trading volume and income in Singles Day(11/11), Taobao has launched another promotional activity on December 12th, which is the similar e-commerce sales day to Singles Day. Since then, the volume of trading has set a new high every year.

=== Developing Strategy ===

On March 29, 2016, the CEO of Alibaba group, [[Daniel Zhang]], pointed out the three directions of the future development goals for Taobao: more community-based, more content-enabled and local adapted in the 2016 annual customer conference held in Hangzhou.
Taobao extensively uses shopping strategies such as data personalizing, customer loyalties, video broadcasting and the focused demand of a single community to build stages for sellers to display their commodities. It is strictly constructing a new ecosystem from content producing, to content propagating, and content consuming with Alibaba's cooperating internet platforms like Youku, Weibo, Alimama and Alifilms. 
Except for using centralized and demand-matching supplies depending on the need of users to form a self-operational system of content producing and consuming transmission, Taobao also improved the quality of the commodity and its services towards the consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=小兔吃德芙|title=Chinese Wikipedia on Taobao|url=http://baike.baidu.com/item/淘宝网?fromtitle=淘宝&amp;fromid=145661&amp;type=syn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adaptive Agent ===
Taobao applies a searching tool named 'adaptive agents'. An adaptive agent picks up the signals from consumers’ purchase records, including categories, brands, functions and colors etc.; The search engine involves the scanning of a particular bar code. Taobao tracks customers' purchasing history and reorganize it into a series of selections that the buyers are likely to be attracted to. The way that an adaptive agent works is image prior models plus the posterior data using BAYES theory (LAPLACE method):
The possibility of the occurrence of a certain event can be estimated through the frequency of its occurrence in the past.
The ranking of a product or a page can be determined by the combination of its prior information plus its posterior data of click transaction.

The popularity of Taobao's searching model is based on the calculation of correlation rate and quality scores:
*The static score of a product's title (correlation rate).
*The matching score of the title and query of a product (correlation rate).
*The category model of a product (correlation rate).
*The transaction model of the commodity (quality score).
*The sellers model (quality score).
*The feedback (quality score).

Taobao increased its traffic by launching an app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=白喵警花|title=Taobao Search and Advertising|url=http://wenku.baidu.com/view/1f6e7329bd64783e09122bc9.html?from=search|website=Wenke Baidu|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semantic Search ===

Taobao automatically classifies the text and images of the product, and uses tags to make the correlation match. The usage of the semantic search is to solve the correlative problem that key word texts cannot solve, such as images, complex texts, and ambiguous texts. Semantic search is also a way of recommendation that Taobao presents with more similar items consumers might find when searching one keyword. There are entity tagging and other classifications.

=== Taobao for Southeast Asia ===

In September, 2013, Taobao launched its Southeast Asian site. A translation feature is now available on Taobao.com for major languages in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taobao for Southeast Asia|url=http://www.taobaothailand.com/taobao-%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9E%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%95%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%AB/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203195115/http://www.taobaothailand.com/taobao-%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9E%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%95%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%AB/|archivedate=2014-02-03|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Public Employees Fair Employment Act''' (more commonly known as the '''Taylor Law''') refers to Article 14 of the New York State Civil Service Law, which defines the rights and limitations of [[labor union|unions]] for public employees in [[New York (state)|New York]].

The Public Employees Fair Employment Act (the Taylor Law) is a New York State statute, named after labor researcher [[George W. Taylor (professor)|George W. Taylor]]. It authorizes a governor-appointed State Public Employment Relations Board to resolve contract disputes for public employees while curtailing their right to strike.

The law provides for mediation and binding [[arbitration]] to give voice to unions, but work stoppages are made punishable with fines and jail time. The [[United Federation of Teachers]] and the Uniformed Sanitationmen’s Association challenged the Taylor Law at its 1967 inception. Following a 2005 strike, Transit Workers’ president [[Roger Toussaint]] was incarcerated for three days as per a Taylor Law ruling.

==Details==
The Taylor Law grants public employees the right to organize and elect their union representatives. It defines the boundaries for public employers in negotiating and entering into agreements with public unions. The law also defines the terms for the foundation of the Public Employment Relations Board, a state agency that administers the law in matters related to public strike negotiation. The board consists of three members appointed by the governor. Each member must be approved by the senate, and only two may be of the same political party.

One of the most controversial parts of the Taylor Law is Section 210, which prohibits New York state public employees from striking. For certain unions, primarily law enforcement (such as police officers), it provides for compelling binding PERB arbitration in the event of an impasse in negotiations.  For others, except for law enforcement unions, it provides for non-binding "fact-finding," in which a panel of arbitrators make a recommendation to the parties on what is considered a fair settlement of the dispute.

The penalties for striking is an additional day of pay for each day of a strike, totaling two days' loss for each strike day, removal of the "Dues Check-off", and imprisonment of the Union's President.

The law does not apply to [[Long Island Rail Road]], [[Metro-North Railroad]] and [[Staten Island Railway]] employees, who are subjected to the jurisdiction of the Federal [[Railway Labor Act]] of 1926.

==History==
The law was put into effect in 1967, following costly transit strikes the previous year and is named for George W. Taylor, chairman of the commission appointed by NY Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] to propose amendments to the [[Condon-Wadlin Act]].

Taylor was a professor of industrial research at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton school for forty years before his death in 1972. He served as an advisor on labor relations issues to Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson.  Taylor was a strong supporter of the strike in private sector bargaining.

Since its declaration, the law has been cited in preventing public employee strikes. However, public employees have struck since the introduction of the law:

The [[United Federation of Teachers]] struck in Ocean Hill-Brownsville strike of 1968 and struck for five days over the issue of class size in 1975.

The fine was applied during the [[New York City Transit Authority]] [[1980 New York City transit strike|1980 transit strike]] and was applied again in the [[2005 New York City transit strike|2005 transit strike]] (involving both the Transit Authority and a separate unit of the MTA, [[MTA Bus Company]] (for the latter, only workers who were members of [[Transport Workers Union of America|Transport Workers Union]] (TWU) Local 100).

During the 2005 transit strike, both the strikers and the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] violated portions of the Taylor Law. Section 210 states that the workers are not allowed to strike; Section 201, Part 4, states that employers are not allowed to negotiate benefits provided by a public retirement fund or payment to a fund or insurer to provide an income for retirees.

In addition, in the wake of the 2005 strike, the New York State Supreme Court in Kings County ([[Brooklyn]]), declared TWU Local 100 in violation of the Taylor Law, and issued a fine of $1,000,000 per day, pursuant with the guidelines set forth in the law. Two smaller unions also representing NYC Transit Authority workers, [[Amalgamated Transit Union]] Locals 726 and 1056, were fined smaller amounts.

==Criticism and reform==
While government officials support the Taylor Law as a way of preventing strikes by municipal unions in New York, the unions contend that the law is harsh on them. The labor unions also contend that the Taylor Law does not provide government agencies the incentive to negotiate contracts on a timely basis and negotiate the terms of the contract in good faith. There have been lobbying efforts by municipal unions to the New York state legislature to change the Taylor Law, but there is some resistance or reluctance to modifying the law.

With the creation and assistance of the Taylor Law, members of many organizations including the [[Albany, NY Fire Department]] were able to unionize, becoming one of the strongest political organizations. In 1970 was the birth of Union Local 2007, which was also responsible in paving the way for all other public sector unions in [[Albany, New York]].

The Taylor Law has been a frequent target for [[Upstate New York]] anti-union activists; they claim that it severely limits the ability of governments to limit spending on unionized labor, with minimal recourse in the event the unions illegally strike.

One particular clause, the Triborough Amendment, mandates that in the event of a lack of a contract, the terms of the previous contract continue indefinitely. This amendment protects workers when contracts expire before an agreement is reached, as otherwise, governments could simply wait until contracts expire, and then unilaterally alter the terms. 
The [[Conservative Party of New York State]], which seeks the abolition of the amendment, argues that the amendment's guarantee of a perpetual contract eliminates any incentive for unions to negotiate in good faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/67258/conservative-party-says-make-sure-you-vote-on-tuesday/ Conservative Party says 'Make sure you vote on Tuesday']. ''Albany Times Union.'' Retrieved 2011-05-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have made the argument that while there is no corollary to the Triborough Amendment under the [[National Labor Relations Act]], which governs private sector workers, those workers may strike at impasse. Some unions believe it would be fundamentally unfair to eliminate the Triborough Amendment but at the same time continuing the Taylor Law's prohibition against strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning About: Triborough Amendment and the Taylor Law|url=http://rvcta.ny.aft.org/about-us/learning-about-triborough-amendment-and-taylor-law|website=Rockville Centre Teachers' Association|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To do so would provide no incentive for management to negotiate a fair contract since it could always just change the contract as it saw fit after reaching impasse, leaving the workers and unions with no legal recourse. That would be completely unprecedented in American Labor law.

The Buffalo Teachers Federation, for instance, illegally struck in September 2000, which delayed the start of the school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peterson|first1=Iver|title=Teachers In Buffalo Back to Work For Now|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/16/nyregion/teachers-in-buffalo-back-to-work-for-now.html|accessdate=1 May 2015|work=The New York Times|date=16 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[law]], '''time constraints''' are placed on certain [[lawsuit|action]]s and [[Filing (legal)|filings]] in the interest of speedy justice, and additionally to prevent the evasion of the ends of justice by waiting until a matter is [[Mootness (law)|moot]].  The penalty for violating a legislative or court-imposed time constraint may be anything from a small fine to judicial determination of an entire case against one's interests.

For example, if a complaining party files an action and then fails to cause the papers pertaining thereto to be served on the opposing party within the time established by local rules, and is unable to convince the court that there was good and sufficient reason for the delay, he risks having his action dismissed [[with prejudice]]. If the opposing party is served with the papers and Anil fails to respond within the time limit provided for his answer, he risks having the case decided against him by [[default (law)|default]].

If one is aggrieved by the judicial outcome of an action and wishes to [[appeal]], he may be forever barred from doing so if he fails to meet the deadline by which his appeal may be filed.

By court order, or by local rule, there may be other time constraints. One may be required to answer [[interrogatories]] or a [[request to produce]] or other [[discovery (law)|discovery]] [[pleading]]s within a given time. He may be required to give a certain number of days' advance notice before he intends to [[deposition (law)|depose]] a [[party (law)|party]] or [[witness]]. A court may order that there will be only a certain number of weeks or months allowed during which the parties to an action may conduct discovery. There may be a limitation placed upon a [[Deposition (law)|deposition]], requiring that the party taking it conclude his questioning within a certain number of hours or days.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3613">The '''Tueller Drill''' is a [[self-defense]] training exercise to prepare against a short-range knife attack when armed only with a [[holster]]ed [[handgun]].

[[Sergeant]] Dennis Tueller, of the [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] [[Police]] Department wondered how quickly an attacker with a knife could cover {{convert|21|ft|m}}, so he timed volunteers as they raced to stab the target. He determined that it could be done in 1.5 seconds. These results were first published as an article in ''[[SWAT_(magazine)|SWAT]]'' magazine in 1983 and in a police training video by the same title, "How Close is Too Close?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Tueller |first=Dennis |title=How Close is Too Close? |journal=S.W.A.T. Magazine |date=March 1983 |url=http://www.theppsc.org/Staff_Views/Tueller/How.Close.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.policeone.com/police-products/firearms/articles/63695006-What-officers-really-need-to-know-about-the-21-foot-kill-zone/|title=What officers really need to know about the 21-foot kill zone|newspaper=PoliceOne|access-date=2017-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A defender with a gun has a dilemma. If he shoots too early, he risks being accused of [[murder]]. If he waits until the attacker is definitely within striking range so there is no question about [[Motive_(law)|motives]], he risks injury and even death. The Tueller experiments quantified a "danger zone" where an attacker presented a clear threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ayoob |first=Massad |author-link=Massad Ayoob |title=Explaining the deadly force decision: the opportunity factor |journal=Shooting Industry |date=October 1991 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3197/is_n10_v36/ai_11549909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tueller Drill combines both parts of the original time trials by Tueller. There are several ways it can be conducted:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kuci.org/~dany/firearms/all_drills.html |title=Handgun Drills, Standards, and Training Page |accessdate=2008-04-16 |last=Young |first=Dan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416194313/http://www.kuci.org/~dany/firearms/all_drills.html |archivedate=2008-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The (simulated) attacker and shooter are positioned back-to-back. At the signal, the "attacker" sprints away from the shooter, and the shooter unholsters his gun and shoots at the target {{convert|21|ft|m}} in front of him. The attacker stops as soon as the shot is fired. The shooter is successful only if his shot is good and if the runner did not cover {{convert|21|ft|m}}.
#A more stressful arrangement is to have the attacker begin {{convert|21|ft|m}} behind the shooter and run towards the shooter. The shooter is successful only if he was able take a good shot before he is tapped on the back by the attacker.
#If the shooter is armed with only a training replica gun, a full-contact drill may be done with the attacker running towards the shooter. In this variation, the shooter should practice side-stepping the attacker while he is drawing the gun.

[[MythBusters]] covered the drill in the 2012 episode "Duel Dilemmas". At {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}}, the gun-wielder was able to shoot the charging knife attacker just as he reached the shooter. At shorter distances the knife wielder was always able to stab prior to being shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/duel-dilemmas.htm |publisher= Discovery |work= MythBusters |title= Duel Dilemas |date= 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''United States v Burns''''' [2001] 1 [[Supreme Court Reports (Canada)|S.C.R.]] 283, 2001 SCC 7, was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in which it was found that [[extradition]] of individuals to places where they may face the [[death penalty]] is a breach of [[fundamental justice]] under [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 7]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. The decision reached this conclusion through a discussion of evidence regarding the arbitrary nature of execution, although the Court did not go so far as to say execution was also unconstitutional under [[Section Twelve of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 12]] of the Charter, which forbids [[cruel and unusual punishment]]s.

The case essentially overruled ''[[Kindler v Canada (Minister of Justice)]]'' (1991) and ''[[Reference Re Ng Extradition]]'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed., page 992.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Burns'', the Supreme Court justices claimed to be considering different kinds of evidence.

==Background== 
The [[Bellevue Police Department (Washington)|police department]] in [[Bellevue, Washington]], of the [[United States]] accused two Canadian citizens, Glen Sebastian Burns and Atif Ahmad Rafay, of murdering Rafay's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirotv.com/news/14110003/detail.html|title=KIRO 7 News - 48 Hours Mystery Unravels Bellevue Murder Case|publisher=Kirotv.com|date=2007-09-13|accessdate=2010-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202165108/http://www.kirotv.com/news/14110003/detail.html|archive-date=2008-12-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After returning to Canada, Burns and Rafay confessed to [[undercover]] [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]. The RCMP used the [[Mr._Big_(police_procedure)|Mr. Big tactic]] to extract the confessions, a practice that is illegal in the United States, but was legal at the time in Canada. After the investigation was complete, Burns and Rafay claimed their confessions were false, highly manipulated, and that jurors were biased by the media coverage of the crime. Nonetheless, plans were made to extradite Burns and Rafay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2011-2012/trueconfession/timeline.html The Fifth State - True Confessions - Timeline of Events - Aired October 14, 2011], cbc.ca; accessed October 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The extradition would be possible through an extradition treaty under which the [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice for Canada]] may seek assurances that the fugitive accused would not be subject to the death penalty. However, the [[Allan Rock|Minister of Justice]] did not seek assurances in the case. Burns and Rafay launched a number of Charter challenges to the Canadian government's decision, including that [[Section Six of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 6]] [[mobility rights]] provided them rights against extradition and to be charged in Canada (since the murders occurred in the US, Canada could only charge them with planning the crime, so this option was ruled out). 

It was further argued that, while the ''Kindler'' case had held that it was not a breach of fundamental justice to extradite persons regardless of the risk of execution, the Burns case was special because it involved Canadian citizens; section 6 rights against exile were used to reinforce this argument.

==Decision==
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2017}}
The decision of the Court was unanimous and [[By the Court opinions of the Supreme Court of Canada|anonymously]] written, and held that extradition in this case, involving the risk of execution, would indeed be unconstitutional under the Charter.  Indeed, the government of Canada should always try to avoid execution, except in "exceptional circumstances" (likely to be crimes against humanity). However, the Court rejected any arguments made under section 6, by citing precedent that while extradition, in and of itself, violates section 6, this was permissible under the reasonable limits clause in [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]] of the Charter. The Court also found it useful to cite the case ''[[Re Federal Republic of Germany and Rauca]]''. Since the rights claimant in that case was extradited even though he was so old he would probably die in prison, and thus his rights to return to Canada would be constitutionally denied, it made sense that in this case Burns and Rafay's rights to return could also be constitutionally denied.  (Whether executed or given a life sentence, Burns and Rafay, if convicted, were not expected to return).

The Court also declined to consider the case on the basis of the section 12 ban on cruel and unusual punishments.  This was because [[Section Thirty-two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 32]] makes section 12 binding only on punishments dispensed by the Canadian government, not the US government. While ''Burns'' might then be of little relevance to a section 12 debate if the Canadian government restored the death penalty in Canada, the Court did hint that execution "engages the underlying values of the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment," noting its impossibility to correct (in cases of [[wrongful conviction]]) and its perceived arbitrary nature.

While section 12 was of little direct consequence in ''Burns'', there was precedent that the government of Canada has some responsibility to consider possible outcomes of extradition under section 7 of the Charter (and section 12, like other legal rights, helps to define the broad principles of section 7).&lt;ref name="lawnow"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bowal |first1=Peter |last2=Saini |first2=Preet |title=Whatever Happened To…U.S. v. Burns: Extradition and the Death Penalty |url=https://www.lawnow.org/whatever-happened-us-v-burns-extradition-death-penalty/ |website=lawnow.org |accessdate=3 June 2018 |date=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Section 7 guarantees [[right to life|rights to life]], [[liberty]] and [[security of the person]], to be deprived only with respect to fundamental justice. The applicability of section 7 was thus evident through the infringement of Burns and Rafay's right to life, liberty and security of the person, since "Their lives are potentially at risk." 

Extradition might then breach fundamental justice because, according to precedent in ''[[Canada v Schmidt]]'', if the harm faced by the extradited persons is serious enough, it "[[shocks the conscience]]" of the Canadian population.  Still, the ''Kindler'' case had indicated that extradition regardless of the risk of execution was not a breach of section 7. The Court in ''Burns'' thus had to overrule this. 

While acknowledging ''Kindler'''s "balancing process", the Court wrote that various factors considered in this process will change with the times, and in this case the Court was confronted with more of the "practical and philosophic difficulties associated with the death penalty".

In considering the relationship between fundamental justice and execution, the Court wrote that "philosophic" views of fundamental justice that viewed execution as "inconsistent with the sanctity of human life" were not subject to judicial review, and that the Court could instead consider more legal issues such as "the protection of the innocent, the avoidance of miscarriages of justice, and the rectification of miscarriages of justice where they are found to exist." Hence wrongful convictions were especially to be feared in cases involving execution.

There were arguments that allowing a risk of execution could be compatible with fundamental justice, since the accused had committed a crime in another state and thus no longer had the benefits of [[Canadian law]], and since states should work together to fight crime. However, there were also arguments that this extradition was contrary to fundamental justice.  These included that execution no longer existed in Canada itself, and the legal importance of this state of affairs was reinforced by 40 years of continuity. 

The Court also cited ''[[Reference Re BC Motor Vehicle Act]]'' to note that [[international law]] was important in defining fundamental justice, and while there was no international law against execution per se, international politics are moving in that direction, and more and more states have abolished the death penalty.

The Court paid a fair amount of attention to the risk of wrongful conviction, and how the Court had a duty to protect the innocent. This duty is based in part on [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11]] of the Charter, which includes a right to, for example, [[presumption of innocence]]. To illustrate this point, cases of wrongful convictions were cited from Canada (the case of [[Donald Marshall, Jr.]] was specifically mentioned), the US and the [[United Kingdom]]. 

While "[t]hese miscarriages of justice of course represent a tiny and wholly exceptional fraction of the workload of Canadian courts in murder cases," the Court wrote, "where capital punishment is sought, the state's execution of even one innocent person is one too many." The Court also acknowledged the "[[death row phenomenon]]" as a section 7 concern, noting the psychological stress that would be involved if one is sentenced to die.

The Court cited statements from parliament on capital punishment. The judgement noted that parliament abolished the last death penalty under Canadian law in 1998 with amendments to the ''National Defence Act''. The court cited statements by the Cabinet to characterize this and other acts of Parliament. "In his letter to the respondents, the Minister of Justice emphasized that 'in Canada, Parliament has decided that capital punishment is not an appropriate penalty for crimes committed here...'."

In balancing the arguments that this extradition could be compatible or contrary to fundamental justice, the Court concluded that many of the goals of the Crown could have been met even if Canada had requested that the US would not seek the death penalty. There was thus an infringement of section 7, and the Court then had to consider whether it could be justified under section 1. The Court ruled the infringement was not justified. 

While the government had a sufficient objective for infringing the right, namely working with the US cooperatively to fight crime and to keep good [[Canada–United States relations|relations with the US]], it was not necessary to risk execution for these objectives to be met. Asking that the death penalty should not be sought should not hurt relations with the US because the extradition treaty allows for this. There was also a concern about keeping dangerous criminals out of Canada, but the Court replied that criminals might not find extradition with the risk of a life sentence more attractive than the risk of execution, and thus it was not proven criminals would flee to Canada.

==Resulting extradition and trial==
In March 2001, less than a month after the ruling, Burns and Rafay were extradited to the United States with assurances from prosecutors handling the case that they would not seek the death penalty. During the trial in 2004 (it was delayed by a number of factors), prosecutors claimed that Burns and Rafay plotted to kill Rafay's family and share the money from an insurance policy and the sale of the family home. Burns claimed that his confession to undercover RCMP officers that he and Rafay killed Rafay's family was the result of [[coercion]] by the police. Defense lawyers noted that no forensic evidence linked the two men to the crime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120802175925/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070823/film_070823/20070826?hub=TopStories Filmmaker explores issue of coerced confessions], CTV News, August 26, 2007; retrieved December 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vtc1&gt;Michael D.

In July 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled to limit the admissibility of evidence obtained in the sort of RCMP Mr. Big undercover operations that were used to obtain confessions from Burns and Rafay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14301/index.do R. v.

This ruling states that the admissibility of such evidence may be limited in cases of very young or vulnerable suspects. Burns and Rafay were among the youngest suspects ever targeted in an RCMP undercover operation.  In late 2014, both men filed paperwork to seek an appeal in light of the 2014 Supreme Court of Canada decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rafayburnsappeal.com/currentstatus|title=Current Appeal Status|website=Rafayburnsappeal.com|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murder was the subject of two episodes of the 2017 Netflix documentary-series ''[[The Confession Tapes]]''&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Confession Tapes |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7349602/ |website=imdb |publisher=imdb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and True Crime Garage podcasts.&lt;ref name="seattleweekly"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dawson |first1=Raechel |title=‘The Confession Tapes’ Re-Opens the Triple-Murder Case of Sebastian Burns and Atif Rafay |url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/king-county-prosecutor-dan-satterberg-says-the-show-is-bunk-the-creators-disagree/ |accessdate=3 June 2018 |work=seattleweekly |date=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thewalrus.ca"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rafay |first1=Atif |title=On the Margins of Freedom |url=https://thewalrus.ca/on-the-margins-of-freedom/ |website=thewalrus.ca |publisher=thewalrus.ca |accessdate=3 June 2018 |date=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''White Turks''' ({{lang-tr|Beyaz Türkler}}) is a term used in [[Turkey]] for the [[Urban area|urban]] population that embraces progressive, [[Secularism|secular]], [[Western world|Western]], [[Republicanism in Turkey|Republican]] values. White Turks are in contrast to the so-called '''Black Turks''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Kara Türkler'' or ''Siyah Türkler''), a name for the conservative, Islamic, and typically less educated among the originally [[Rural area|rural]] [[Anatolia|Anatolian]] population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramm|first=Christoph|date=2016-12-01|title=Beyond ‘Black Turks’ and ‘White Turks’ – The Turkish Elites’ Ongoing Mission to Civilize a Colourful Society|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/asia.2016.70.issue-4/asia-2016-0035/asia-2016-0035.xml|journal=Asiatische Studien - Études Asiatiques|language=en|volume=70|issue=4|pages=|doi=10.1515/asia-2016-0035|issn=2235-5871|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408141528/https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/asia.2016.70.issue-4/asia-2016-0035/asia-2016-0035.xml|archive-date=2018-04-08|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two terms are related to the emergence of a middle class since the end of the 20th century, and is an expression of elite consciousness and also a contempt for a section of the population which is seen as backwards.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Civilizing efforts had been part of the imagination of all Turkish elites since the [[Tanzimat]] reforms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Anand Giridharadas]] describes the dichotomy between white and black Turks as "an extraordinary [[culture war]] over what it means to be a Turk":&lt;blockquote&gt;The battle — waged in [[Politics of Turkey|national politics]] but also in life’s daily minutiae — has become, literally, black and white. In one corner are “white Turks,” who revere the republic’s founder, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Kemal Atatürk]], and his mission to remake Turkey in Europe’s image — [[Secular state|secular]], [[Republicanism in Turkey|republican]], purged of its [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] legacies. In the other corner are “black Turks,” conservative Muslims who, in a mostly [[Muslim]] nation, were marginalized for decades, excluded from the Turkish elite — until, in 2003, [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|one of their own]] became a populist [[Prime Minister of Turkey|prime minister]] and began what many black Turks consider a healthy rebalancing and many white Turks, the politics of resentment or, worse, revenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/01/world/europe/01iht-currents01.html|title=In Turkey, Forging a New Identity|last=Giridharadas|first=Anand|date=2012-11-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408141649/https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/01/world/europe/01iht-currents01.html|archive-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Tayyip Erdoğan]] often describes himself as a black Turk.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/turkey-s-powerful-prime-minister-who-can-challenge-erdogan-a-495683-2.html|title=Turkey's Powerful Prime Minister: Who Can Challenge Erdogan?|last=Mayr|first=Walter|date=2007-07-16|work=Spiegel Online|access-date=2018-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006231857/http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/turkey-s-powerful-prime-minister-who-can-challenge-erdogan-a-495683-2.html|archive-date=2017-10-06|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also used by 2018 presidential candidate [[Muharrem İnce]] to describe himself, claiming that Erdoğan was no longer a black Turk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/turkiye/993799/ince__Erdogan_Beyaz_Turk__ben_Turkiye_nin_zencisiyim.html|title=İnce: Erdoğan Beyaz Türk, ben Türkiye'nin zencisiyim|last=|first=|date=2018-06-10|work=Cumhuriyet|access-date=2018-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612025658/http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/turkiye/993799/ince__Erdogan_Beyaz_Turk__ben_Turkiye_nin_zencisiyim.html|archive-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[Irony|ironic]] approach to the conceptual pair, [[Mümin Sekman]] wrote in his book "Türk Usulü Başarı" that, among other things, black Turks listen to [[Arabesque (Turkish music)|Arabesque]] and [[Turkish folk music|folk music]], while white Turks prefer western music and [[Turkish pop music|Turkish pop]]; black Turks have [[Arranged marriage|arranged marriages]], while white Turks choose their own partners; white Turks meet at airports, while black Turks use bus terminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Türk Usulü Başarı|last=Sekmen|first=Mümin|publisher=Arıtan Yayınevi|year=2000|isbn=9789753167185|location=[[Istanbul]]|pages=269-270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ertuğrul Özkök]] of [[Hürriyet]] considers himself a white Turk and generalizes the group as follows: "They live mainly in coastal regions, are sensitive when it comes to [[Secularism in Turkey|secularism]], they drink alcohol, have a high purchasing power, a western lifestyle and the women do not wear [[Hijab|hijabs]]". He also stated in 2014 that under the current rule of the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]], white Turks have become the new oppressed group in Turkey after [[Kurds]] and [[Alevism|Alevis]], and that the increasingly marginalized white Turks must "learn to fight by defending their lifestyles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ensonhaber.com/ozkok-yeni-ezilen-kesim-beyaz-turkler-2014-04-05.html|title=Özkök: Yeni ezilen kesim Beyaz Türkler|last=|first=|date=2014-04-05|website=Ensonhaber|language=tr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408040200/http://www.ensonhaber.com/ozkok-yeni-ezilen-kesim-beyaz-turkler-2014-04-05.html|archive-date=2014-04-08|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
These terms are believed to have originally been coined by the late journalist {{Interlanguage link|Ufuk Güldemir|tr||WD=}} in his 1992 book "Teksas [[Malatya]]". The term "white Turks" was meant to be analogous to the American [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} and was used to describe an old elite who opposed the then-Prime Minister [[Turgut Ozal|Turgut Özal]] because of his Kurdish origin, religiousness and lack of [[Turkish Armed Forces|military]] service. The term was subsequently taken up by sociologist [[Nilufer Gole|Nilüfer Göle]] and popularized by Turkish columnists, journalists and political scientists who used it to refer to various social groups in Turkey.

== Grey Turks ==
Some observers, such as [[Ayşe Sözen]] and [[Nilüfer Narlı]], also note the emergence of a third group of "Grey Turks", who are urbanized, well-educated and enjoy western music and films, but are pious Muslims. Some use the term to refer to the aspiring black Turks that climbed the socio-economic ladder during the [[Turgut Özal]] era and gained momentum during the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]]'s current rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=288628|title=A new class of Hybrid Turks emerging between White and Black Turks|last=Akarçeşme|first=Sevgi|date=2012-08-05|website=Today's Zaman|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807205110/http://www.todayszaman.com:80/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=288628|archive-date=2012-08-07|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
