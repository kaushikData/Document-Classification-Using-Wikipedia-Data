'''Alorese''' (Bahasa Alor) is an [[Austronesian language]] spoken on [[Alor Island|Alor]] and the neighboring islands of the [[Alor archipelago]] in eastern Indonesia. It is not to be confused with non-Austronesian ([[Papuan languages|Papuan]]) languages of the [[Alor–Pantar languages|Alor–Pantar family]] which are also spoken in this region. It is also distinct from [[Malay_trade_and_creole_languages#Alor_Malay|Alor Malay]], a Malay variety which is currently supplanting Alorese as the language of wider communication in the region.  Alorese is the native language of several immigrant communities located along the coast of the Alor archipelago, especially at [[Alor Kecil]] on Alor and at [[Baranusa]] and Marica on Pantar. It has also been used extensively as a trade language in the region.

Primary linguistic research is severely lacking:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The scope of this language and its internal variation are unknown. The speakers of Alor are oriented towards [[Lembata]] and [[Adonara]], and are bilingual in [[Lamaholot]] as a language of wider communication. Alor is not mutually intelligible with Adonara or languages of Lembata. Because of their bilingualism, 'Alor' was formerly listed in much literature as a 'dialect' of Lamaholot." (Grimes et al 1997:57)&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, Charles E., Tom Therik, Barbara Dix  Grimes &amp; Max Jacob. 1997. A guide to the people and languages of Nusa Tenggara. (Paradigma series B 1). Kupang, Indonesia: Universitas Kristen Artha Wacana and Alfa Omega Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Support appears in Klamer &amp; Klamer (2010), who found that Alorese shares only half its basic vocabulary with Lamaholot.

'''Amy Tan''' (born February 19, 1952) is an American writer whose works explore mother-daughter relationships and the [[Chinese American]] experience. Her novel ''[[The Joy Luck Club (novel)|The Joy Luck Club]]'' was adapted into a [[The Joy Luck Club (film)|film]] in 1993 by director [[Wayne Wang]].

Tan has written several other novels, including ''[[The Kitchen God's Wife]]'', ''[[The Hundred Secret Senses]]'', ''[[The Bonesetter's Daughter]]'', ''[[Saving Fish from Drowning]]'', and ''[[The Valley of Amazement]]''. Tan's latest book is a memoir entitled ''Where The Past Begins: A Writer's Memoir'' (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/22/amy-tan-writing-exhilarating-wish-hadnt-been-published-memoir-joy-luck-club|title=Where the Past Begins: A Writer's Memoir|date=2017-10-17|publisher=Ecco|year=|isbn=9780062319296|location=New York|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to these, Tan has written two [[children's books]]: ''The Moon Lady'' (1992) and ''[[Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat (book)|Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat]]'' (1994), which was turned into an animated series that aired on [[PBS]].

Despite her success, Tan has also received substantial criticism for her depictions of Chinese culture and apparent adherence to stereotypes.&lt;ref name=jonathan&gt;Lee, Jonathan (2015). ''Chinese Americans: The History and Culture of a People: The History and Culture of a People''. p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cynthia/&gt;

==Personal life==
Tan was born in [[Oakland, California]]. She is the second of three children born to [[Chinese immigrants]] John and Daisy Tan. Her father was an [[electrical engineer]] and [[Baptist]] minister who traveled to the United States in order to escape the chaos of the [[Chinese Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.nydailynews.com/2001-02-27/entertainment/18179778_1_amy-tan-daisy-tan-joy-luck-club | title = Mother As Tormented Muse Amy Tan Drew On A Dark Past For 'Daughter' | author = Sherryl Connelly | date = February 27, 2001 | website = nydailynews.com | publisher = [[New York Daily News]] | accessdate = 15 December 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110314065627/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2001-02-27/entertainment/18179778_1_amy-tan-daisy-tan-joy-luck-club | archivedate = 2011-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=achieve/&gt; Tan attended [[Marian A. Peterson High School]] in [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]] for one year. When she was fifteen years old, her father and older brother Peter both died of [[brain tumor]]s within six months of each other.&lt;ref name="Huntley1998"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Amy Tan: A Critical Companion|last = Huntley|first = E.D.|publisher = Greenwood Press|year = 1998|isbn = 0313302073|location = Westport, Conn.|pages = 5–7, 80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daisy subsequently moved Amy and her younger brother, John Jr., to Switzerland, where Amy finished high school at the [[Institut Monte Rosa]], [[Montreux]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Archives of my Personality", address to American Association of Museums General Session (Los Angeles), May 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Amy learned about her mother's previous marriage to another man in [[China]], of their four children (a son who died as a toddler and three daughters), and how her mother left these children behind in [[Shanghai]]. This incident was the basis for Tan's first novel ''[[The Joy Luck Club (novel)|The Joy Luck Club]]''.&lt;ref name=achieve&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/tan0bio-1 |title=Amy Tan Biography |accessdate=May 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702234118/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/tan0bio-1 |archivedate=July 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1987, Amy traveled with Daisy to China. There, Amy met her three half-sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://us.penguingroup.com/static/rguides/us/joy_luck_club.html | title = Penguin Reading Guides - The Joy Luck Club - Amy Tan | accessdate = August 7, 2010 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100724064451/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/rguides/us/joy_luck_club.html | archivedate = July 24, 2010 | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tan had a difficult relationship with her mother. At one point, Daisy held a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her while the two were arguing over Amy's new boyfriend. Her mother wanted Tan to be independent, stressing that Tan needed to make sure she was self-sufficient. Tan later found out that her mother had three abortions while in China. Daisy often threatened to kill herself, saying that she wanted to join her mother (Tan's grandmother, who also committed suicide).&lt;ref name="NPR.org"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/10/17/558295524/-i-am-full-of-contradictions-novelist-amy-tan-on-fate-and-family|title='I Am Full Of Contradictions': Novelist Amy Tan On Fate And Family|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attempted suicide but never succeeded.&lt;ref name="NPR.org"/&gt; Daisy died in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/amy-tan-still-joy-lucky-after-all-these-years/2017/10/10/a2bbb788-a573-11e7-b14f-f41773cd5a14_story.html|title=Amy Tan talks about her new memoir, politics and why she’s not always ‘joy lucky’|last=Krug|first=Nora|date=2017-10-11|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tan and her mother did not speak for six months after Tan dropped out of the Baptist college her mother had selected for her, [[Linfield College]] in Oregon, to follow her boyfriend to [[San Jose City College]] in California.&lt;ref name=achieve/&gt;&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt;&lt;ref name=tauber/&gt; Tan met him on a [[blind date]] and married him in 1974.&lt;ref name=Huntley1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=kinsella&gt;{{cite news |last= Kinsella |first= Bridget |date= August 9, 2013 |title= ‘Fifty Shades of Tan’: Amy Tan |url= http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/profiles/article/58667-fifty-shades-of-tan-amy-tan.html |newspaper= Publishers Weekly |location= |accessdate= October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tauber&gt;{{cite news |last= Tauber |first= Michelle |date= November 3, 2003 |title= A New Ending |url= http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20148516,00.html |newspaper= People Magazine |location= |accessdate= 11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tan later received bachelor's and master's degrees in English and [[linguistics]] from [[San Jose State University]]. She also participated in doctoral studies in linguistics at [[University of California, Santa Cruz|UC Santa Cruz]] and [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], but abandoned her doctoral studies in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/tan0bio-1 |title=Amy Tan Biography |accessdate=July 19, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702234118/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/tan0bio-1 |archivedate=July 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in school, Tan worked odd jobs—serving as a [[switchboard operator]], [[carhop]], bartender, and pizza maker—before starting a writing career. As a freelance business writer, she worked on projects for [[AT&amp;T]], [[IBM]], [[Bank of America]], and [[Pacific Bell]], writing under non-Chinese-sounding pseudonyms.&lt;ref name=Huntley1998 /&gt;

While Tan was studying at Berkeley, her roommate was murdered, and Tan had to identify the body. The incident left her temporarily mute. She claimed that every year for ten years, on the day she identified the body, she lost her voice.&lt;ref name="Jaggi"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/03/fiction.features|title=Interview with Amy Tan|last=Jaggi|first=Maya|date=2001-03-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Tan contracted [[Lyme disease]], which went misdiagnosed for a few years. As a result, she suffers complications like [[epileptic seizure]]s.

Tan also suffers from depression, for which she takes antidepressants. Part of the reason that Tan chose not to have children was a fear that she would pass on a genetic legacy of mental instability - her maternal grandmother committed suicide, her mother threatened suicide often, and she herself has struggled with suicidal ideation.&lt;ref name="Jaggi"/&gt;

Tan resides in [[San Francisco]], California, with her husband in a house they designed "to feel open and airy, like a tree house, but also to be a place where we could live comfortably into old age" with accessibility features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Tan |first= Amy |date= July 30, 2014 |title= Amy Tan on Joy and Luck at Home: The novelist builds a home she can grow old in |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/amy-tans-joy-and-luck-1406742990 |newspaper= The Wall Street Journal |location= |accessdate= October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tan has recently taken up drawing and has shared her art on social media.

Tan sang with the [[Rock Bottom Remainders]] before they retired from touring.

==Work and themes==
Tan's first novel, ''The Joy Luck Club'', consists of sixteen related stories about the experiences of four [[Chinese American]] mother-daughter pairs.&lt;ref&gt;"Amy Tan." Contemporary Literary Criticism. Vol. 257. Detroit: Gale, 2008. Literature Resource Center.&lt;/ref&gt; Tan's second novel, ''[[The Kitchen God's Wife]]'', also focuses on the relationship between an immigrant Chinese mother and her American-born daughter.&lt;ref name=Huntley1998 /&gt; Tan's third novel, ''[[The Hundred Secret Senses]]'', was a departure from the first two novels, in focusing on the relationships between sisters.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Tan's fourth novel, ''[[The Bonesetter's Daughter]]'', returns to the theme of an immigrant Chinese woman and her American-born daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyte, Kirsten D.

==Adaptations==
Tan's work has been adapted into several different forms of media. ''The Joy Luck Club'' was adapted into a play in 1993; that same year, director [[Wayne Wang]] adapted the book into a [[The Joy Luck Club (film)|film]]. ''The Bonesetter's Daughter'' was adapted into an [[The Bonesetter's Daughter (opera)|opera]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/Opera-review-Bonesetter-s-Daughter-3195073.php|title=Opera review: 'Bonesetter's Daughter'|last=Kosman|first=Joshua|date=September 15, 2008|website=SF Gate|publisher=|accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tan's children's book ''[[Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat]]'' was adapted into a [[PBS]] animated television show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sagwa: About the show|url=http://pbskids.sproutonline.me/sagwa/caregivers/index.html|publisher=PBS Kids|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017062246/http://pbskids.sproutonline.me/sagwa/caregivers/index.html|archivedate=October 17, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Though she has won several awards for her work, Tan has also received substantial criticism for her "complicity in perpetuating racial stereotypes and misrepresentations as well as gross inaccuracies in recalling details of the Chinese cultural heritage".&lt;ref name=jonathan/&gt; Sau-ling Cynthia Wong, a professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], wrote that Tan's novels "appear to possess the authority of authenticity but are often products of the American-born writer's own heavily mediated understanding of things Chinese".&lt;ref name=cynthia&gt;Wong, Sau-ling Cynthia (1995). ''Sugar Sisterhood: Situating the Amy Tan Phenomenon''. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer stated that the popularity of Tan's work can mostly be attributed to Western consumers "who find her work comforting in its reproduction of stereotypical images".&lt;ref name=lily&gt;Lee, Lily (2003). ''中國婦女傳記詞典: The Twentieth Century, 1912-2000''. p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt;

The often negative depiction of Chinese culture and Chinese men in Tan's work has raised eyebrows, with one scholar going so far as to say that the storylines of her novels "demonstrate a vested interest in casting Chinese men in the worst possible light".&lt;ref name=xiaohuang&gt;Yin, Xiao-huang (2000). ''Chinese American Literature Since the 1850s''. p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; This, in addition to the lack of cultural and historical accuracy in Tan's work, has led several writers and scholars to accuse Tan of "pandering to the popular imagination" of Westerners regarding Chinese people.&lt;ref name=huntley&gt;Huntley, E. D. (2001). ''Maxine Hong Kingston: A Critical Companion''. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language can be artistic to the extent that artists use it as a source of creativity in art, poetry, calligraphy or as a metaphor to address themes as cultural diversity and the vulnerability of the individual in a globalizing world.&lt;ref&gt;(nl) Lies Daenen, ''[http://bamart.be/nl/pages/detail/10884 De (on)macht van taal. Over Patrick Keulemans]'', kunstenaar (the '(un)power' of language. About artist Patrick Keulemans), text for the artexhibition 'unwritten &amp; written', Kunst, Beeldende kunst, 20 augustus 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[engineered language]]s or [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary language]]s, artistic languages often have irregular grammar systems, much like natural [[language]]s.  Many are designed within the context of [[fictional world]]s, such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]].  Others can represent fictional languages in a world not patently different from the real world, or have no particular fictional background attached.

There are several different [[Schools of thought|schools]] of artlang construction. The most prominent is the '''naturalist''' school, which seeks to imitate the complexity and historicity of natural languages. Others typically follow a more abstract style, as the intent behind their construction differs. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

==Genres==

Several different genres of constructed languages are classified as 'artistic'. An artistic language may fall into any one of the following groups, depending on the aim of its use.
Similarly to [[philosophical language]]s, artlangs are created in accordance with an initially defined principle in mind.

=== Fictional languages ===

{{main|Fictional language}}

By far the largest group of artlangs are '''fictional languages''' (sometimes also referred to as "professional artlangs"). Fictional languages are intended to be the languages of a fictional world, and are often designed with the intent of giving more depth and an appearance of plausibility to the fictional worlds with which they are associated, and to have their characters communicate in a fashion which is both alien and dislocated. By analogy with the word "conlang", the term ''[[conworld]]'' is used to describe these worlds, inhabited by fictional [[constructed culture]]s.

There are two major categories of fictional languages.

'''Professional fictional languages''' are those languages created for use in books, movies, television shows, video games, comics, toys, and songs. Prominent examples of works featuring fictional languages include the [[Middle-earth]] and ''[[Star Trek]]'' universes, the game [[Ico]] and the songs of the French band [[Magma (band)|Magma]], singing in Kobaïan.

'''Internet-based fictional languages''' are hosted along with their "conworlds" on the Internet, and based at these sites, becoming known to the world through the visitors to these sites. An example is  [[Verdurian]], the language of [[Mark Rosenfelder]]'s Verduria on the planet of Almea.

=== Alternative languages ===

'''Alternative languages''', or ''altlangs'', speculate on an alternate history and try to reconstruct how a family of natural languages would have evolved if things had been different: e.g., What if Greek civilization had gone on to thrive without a Roman Empire, leaving [[Greek language|Greek]] and not [[Latin]] to develop several modern descendants? The language that ''would have'' evolved is then traced step by step in its evolution, to reach its modern form. An altlang will typically base itself on the core vocabulary of one language and the phonology of another. The best-known language of this category is [[Brithenig]], which initiated the interest among Internet conlangers in devising such alternate-historical languages, like [[Wenedyk]]. Brithenig attempts to determine how Romance languages would have evolved had Roman influence in Britain been sufficient to replace Celtic languages with [[Vulgar Latin]], and bases its phonology on that of [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. An earlier instance is [[Philip José Farmer]]'s [[Winkie language]], a relative of the [[Germanic languages]] spoken by the Winkies of Oz in ''A Barnstormer in Oz''. Another example is [[Linguistic purism in English|Anglish]], which tries to reconstruct how English could have looked  without Latin influence.

=== Micronational languages ===

'''Micronational languages''' are the languages created for use in [[micronation]]s. Having the citizens learn the language is as much a part of participating in the micronation as minting coins and stamps or participating in government. The members of these micronations meet up and speak the language they have learned when they are participating in these meets. They coin new words and grammatical constructions when needed. [[Talossan language|Talossan]], from R. Ben Madison's [[Talossa|Kingdom of Talossa]], is by far the best-known example of a micronational language.

=== Personal languages ===

'''Personal languages''' are ultimately created for one's own edification. The creator does not expect anyone to speak it; the language exists as a work of art. A personal language may be invented for the purpose of having a beautiful language, for self-expression, as an exercise in understanding linguistic principles, or perhaps as an attempt to create a language with an extreme phonemic inventory or system of verbs. Personal languages tend to have short lifespans, and are often displayed on the Internet and discussed on message boards much like Internet-based fictional languages. They are often invented in large numbers by the people who design these languages.  However, a few personal languages are used extensively and long-term by their creators (e.g., for writing [[Diary|diaries]]).  Javant Biarujia, the creator of [[Taneraic]], described his personal language (which he terms a '''hermetic language''') thus: "a private pact negotiated between the world at large and the world within me; public words simply could not guarantee me the private expression I sought."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phreacs.com.au/tanerai/ Taneraic on the Web]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050731075734/http://www.phreacs.com.au/tanerai/ |date=July 31, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The author [[Robert Dessaix]] describes the origins of his personal language K: "I wanted words that described reality. So I made them up."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/ling/stories/s693291.htm "The Language of K"], ''Lingua Franca'', 19 December 1998  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527161927/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/ling/stories/s693291.htm |date=May 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Micro languages ===

The aim of some languages is to express deep meaning with very few parts. For instance, [[Toki Pona]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.tokipona.org/wiki/What_is_Toki_Pona%3F What is Toki Pona?]  {{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on just 123 words and 14 'sounds'. The creator, Sonja Lang, says that the principles are built on [[Taoism]]. Another language composed along the same lines is  Papisa-samama&lt;ref&gt;http://papisa-samana.yolasite.com/{{Password-protected}}&lt;/ref&gt; which utilises just six consonants and two vowels, has just 12 syllables, making just a 120 word lexicon. It can be read in its own Chinese-like written form or in a [[pinyin]]-like, romanised form. Unlike Toki Pona, it has a complex number system based on Roman numerals. Both Toki Pona and Papisa-samama have a small root-word vocabulary and rely heavily on compound nouns, for instance, in Papisa-samama, ''enlightenment'' might be translated as ''patima-tasama-simi'', that is, ''deep-thought-light.''

=== Jokelangs ===
{{see also|Language game}}
The term '''jokelang''' is sometimes applied to conlangs created as jokes. These may be languages intended primarily to sound funny, such as [http://www.dilingo.net/ DiLingo], or for some type of [[satire]], often as satire on some aspect of constructed languages.

Some typical jokelangs are:
* [[Europanto]] – an unstructured mixture of European languages
* [[Transpiranto]] – constructed from international words inflected to sound like Swedish jargon, in order to improve malplacedness and ambiguity
* Oou – a deliberately ambiguous and [[polysemous]] language whose writing system is made up entirely of punctuation marks and whose [[phoneme]] inventory is made up entirely of vowels
* DiLingo – a rhyming language that contains much humor, both superficial and cleverly sneaky
* [[:es:Gulevache|Gulevache]] – a fictional joke romance language created by the Argentinian comedy-musical group [[Les Luthiers]] for its opera [[Cardoso en Gulevandia]]
* Unwinese – the nonsensical but structured alternative English, also known as [[gobbledygook]] but named by its creator Basic Engly Twentyfimode, used by comedian [[Stanley Unwin (comedian)|Stanley Unwin]]
* Inflationary Language – invented by comedian [[Victor Borge]], incrementing numbers embedded in words, e.g., ''crenine'' ("create") and ''elevennis'' ("tennis")

===Experimental languages===

{{main|Experimental languages}}

An experimental language is a [[constructed language]] designed for the purpose of exploring some theory of [[linguistics]]. Most such languages are concerned with the relation between [[language and thought]]; however, languages have been constructed to explore other aspects of language as well. In [[science fiction]], much work has been done on the assumption popularly known as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]. Artlangs of this type overlap with [[engineered language]]s.

{{more citations needed|date=July 2011}}
The term '''biophotonics''' denotes a combination of [[biology]] and [[photonics]], with photonics being the science and technology of generation, manipulation, and detection of [[photon]]s, [[quantum]] units of [[light]]. Photonics is related to [[electronics]] and [[photons]]. Photons  play a central role in  information technologies such as fiber optics the way [[electrons]] do in electronics.

Biophotonics can also be described as the "development and application of optical techniques, particularly imaging, to the study of biological molecules, cells and tissue". One of the main benefits of using optical techniques which make up biophotonics is that they preserve the integrity of the biological cells being examined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/innovation/groups/biophotonics/index.aspx King's College London Centre for Biophotonics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=SPIE|title=Gabriel Popescu plenary talk: Bridging Molecular and Cellular Biology with Optics|journal=SPIE Newsroom|date=2015|doi=10.1117/2.3201503.18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biophotonics has therefore become the established general term for all techniques that deal with the interaction between biological items and photons. This refers to emission, detection, absorption, reflection, modification, and creation of radiation from biomolecular, cells, tissues, organisms and biomaterials. Areas of application are [[life science]], [[medicine]], [[agriculture]], and [[environmental science]].
Similar to the differentiation between "[[electric]]" and "[[electronics]]" a difference can be made between applications such as [[Therapy]] and [[surgery]], which use light mainly to transfer energy, and applications such as [[diagnostics]], which use light to excite matter and to transfer information back to the operator. In most cases the term biophotonics refers to the latter type of application.

==Applications==

'''Applications'''

Biophotonics is an interdisciplinary field involving the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and biological materials including: tissues, cells, sub-cellular structures, and molecules in living organisms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Serafetinides|first=Alexandros A.|last2=Makropoulou|first2=Mirsini|last3=Kotsifaki|first3=Domna G.|last4=Tsigaridas|first4=Giorgos|date=2017-01-05|title=Biophotonics for imaging and cell manipulation: quo vadis?|url=https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10226/1022613/Biophotonics-for-imaging-and-cell-manipulation-quo-vadis/10.1117/12.2263036.short|publisher=International Society for Optics and Photonics|volume=10226|pages=1022613|doi=10.1117/12.2263036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent biophotonics research has created new applications for clinical diagnostics and therapies involving fluids, cells and tissues. These advances are allowing scientists and physicians opportunities for superior, non-invasive diagnostics for vascular and blood flow, as well as tools for better examination of skin lesions.  In addition to new diagnostic tools, the advancements in biophotonics research has provided new photothermal, photodynamic, and tissue therapies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krafft|first=Christoph|date=2016|title=Modern trends in biophotonics for clinical diagnosis and therapy to solve unmet clinical needs|url=|journal=Journal of Biophotonics 9|volume=11-12|pages=1362–1375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''&lt;u&gt;[[Dermatology]]&lt;/u&gt;'' By observing the numerous and complex interactions between light and biological materials, the field of biophotonics presents a unique set of diagnostic techniques that medical practitioners can utilize. Biophotonic imaging provides the field of dermatology with the only non-invasive technique available for diagnosing skin cancers. Traditional diagnostic procedures for skin cancers involve visual assessment and biopsy, but a new Laser Induced Fluorescence spectroscopy technique allow dermatologists to compare spectrographs of a patient's skin with spectrographs known to correspond with malignant tissue. This provides doctors with earlier diagnosis and treatment options.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

“Among optical techniques, an emerging imaging technology based on laser scanning, the [[optical coherence tomography]] or OCT imaging is considered to be a useful tool to differentiate healthy from malignant skin tissue.” The information is immediately accessible and eliminates the need for skin excision.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This also eliminates the need for the skin samples to be processed in a lab which reduces labor costs and processing time.

Furthermore, these optical imaging technologies can be used during traditional surgical procedures to determine the boundaries of lesions to ensure that the entirety of the diseased tissue is removed.  This is accomplished by exposing [[nanoparticle]]s that have been dyed with a fluorescing substance to the acceptable light photons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nanoparticles that are functionalized with fluorescent dyes and marker proteins will congregate in a chosen tissue type. When the particles are exposed to wavelengths of light that correspond to the fluorescent dye, the unhealthy tissue glows. This allows for the attending surgeon to quickly visually identify boundaries between healthy and unhealthy tissue, resulting in less time on the operating table and higher patient recovery.  “Using dielectrophoretic microarray devices, nanoparticles and DNA biomarkers were rapidly isolated and concentrated onto specific microscopic locations where they were easily detected by epifluorescent microscopy”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Optical tweezers|''&lt;u&gt;Optical Tweezers&lt;/u&gt;'']]

Optical tweezers (or traps) are scientific tools employed to maneuver microscopic particles such as atoms, DNA, bacteria, viruses, and other types of nanoparticles.  It uses the lights momentum to exert small forces on a sample. This technique allows for the organizing and sorting of cells, the tracking of the movement of bacteria, and the changing of cell structure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blocklab.stanford.edu/optical_tweezers.html|title=Block lab - Optical tweezers|website=blocklab.stanford.edu|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''&lt;u&gt;Laser Micro-scalpels&lt;/u&gt;'' are a combination of fluorescence  microscopy and a femtosecond laser “can penetrate up to 250 micrometers into tissue and target single cells in 3-D space.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biotechniques.com/news/NEWS-New-laser-microscalpel-to-target-diseased-cells/biotechniques-116068.html|title=BioTechniques - NEWS: New laser microscalpel to target diseased cells|website=www.biotechniques.com|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology, which was patented by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, means that surgeons can excise diseased or damaged cells without disturbing or damaging healthy surrounding cells in delicate surgeries involving areas such as the eyes and vocal chords.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''&lt;u&gt;[[Photoacoustic microscopy]] (PAM)&lt;/u&gt;'' is an imaging technology that utilizes both laser technology and ultrasound technology.  This dual imaging modality is far superior at imaging deep tissue and vascular tissues than previous imaging technologies. The improvement in resolution provides higher quality images of deep tissues and vascular systems, allowing non-invasive differentiation of cancerous tissues vs healthy tissue by observing such things as “water content, oxygen saturation level, and hemoglobin concentration.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yao|first=Junjie|last2=Wang|first2=Lihong V.|date=2014-06-01|title=Sensitivity of photoacoustic microscopy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213597914000111|journal=Photoacoustics|volume=2|issue=2|pages=87–101|doi=10.1016/j.pacs.2014.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have also been able to use PAM to diagnose endometriosis in rats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''&lt;u&gt;[[Low level laser therapy|Low Level Laser Therapy]] (LLLT)&lt;/u&gt;'', although somewhat controversial as to it efficacy, can be used  to treat wounds by repairing tissue and preventing tissue death.  However, more recent studies indicate that LLLT is more useful for  reducing inflammation and assuaging chronic joint pain.  In addition, it is believed that LLLT could possibly prove to be useful in the treatment of severe brain injury or trauma, stroke, and degenerative neurological diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chung|first=Hoon|last2=Dai|first2=Tianhong|last3=Sharma|first3=Sulbha K.|last4=Huang|first4=Ying-Ying|last5=Carroll|first5=James D.|last6=Hamblin|first6=Michael R.|date=February 2012|title=The Nuts and Bolts of Low-level Laser (Light) Therapy|journal=Annals of Biomedical Engineering|volume=40|issue=2|pages=516–533|doi=10.1007/s10439-011-0454-7|issn=0090-6964|pmc=3288797|pmid=22045511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''&lt;u&gt;[[Photodynamic therapy|Photodyanamic Therapy]] (PT)&lt;/u&gt;'' uses photosynthesizing chemicals and oxygen to induce a cellular reaction to light.  It can be used to kill cancer cells, treat acne, and reduce scarring. PT can also kill bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The technology provides treatment with little to no long-term side effects, is less invasive than surgery and can be repeated more often than radiation. Treatment is limited, however, to surfaces and organs that can be exposed to light, which eliminates deep tissue cancer treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types/photodynamic-therapy.html|title=Photodynamic Therapy|website=www.cancer.org|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''&lt;u&gt;[[Photothermal therapy]]&lt;/u&gt;'' most commonly uses nanoparticles made of a noble metal to convert light into heat. The nanoparticles are engineered to absorb light in the 700-1000&amp;nbsp;nm range, where the human body is optically transparent. When the particles are hit by light they heat up, disrupting or destroying the surrounding cells via hyperthermia. Because the light used does not interact with tissue directly, photothermal therapy has few long term side effects and it can be used to treat cancers deep within the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Jing-Liang|date=July–August 2010|title=Gold-Nanoparticle-Enhanced Cancer Photothermal Therapy|url=|journal=IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics |volume=16| issue=4 |pages=989–996 |doi=10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2030340 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FRET==
Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, also known as Foerster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET in both cases) is the term given to the process where two excited "fluorophores" pass energy one to the other non-radiatively (i.e., without exchanging a photon). By carefully selecting the excitation of these flurophores and detecting the emission, FRET has become one of the most widely used techniques in the field of Biophotonics, giving scientists the chance to investigate sub-cellular environments. See the [[Förster resonance energy transfer|full article on FRET]]

==Biofluorescence==
Biofluorescence describes the absorption of ultraviolet or visible light and the sub sequential emission of photons at a lower energy level (S_1 excited state relaxes to S_0 ground state) by intrinsically fluorescent proteins or by synthetic fluorescent molecules covalently attached to a biomarker of interest. Biomarkers are molecules indicative or disease or distress and are a typically monitored systemically in a living organism, or by using an ''ex vivo'' tissue sample for microscopy, or ''in vitro'': in the blood, urine, sweat, saliva, interstitial fluid, aqueous humor, or sputum. Stimulating light excites an electron, raising energy to an unstable level. This instability is unfavorable, so the energized electron is returned to a stable state almost as immediately as it becomes unstable.The time delay between excitation and re-emission that occurs when returning to the stable ground state causes the photon that is re-emitted to be a different color (i.e. it relaxes to a lower energy and thus the photon emitted is at a shorter wavelength, as governed by the [[Planck–Einstein relation|Plank-Einstein relation]]&lt;math&gt; E={\frac {hc}{\lambda }}&lt;/math&gt;) than the excitation light that was absorbed.  This return to stability corresponds with the release of excess energy in the form of fluorescent light. This emission of light is only observable whilst the exciation light is still providing photons to the fluorescent molecule and is typically excited by blue or green light and emits purple, yellow, orange, green, cyan, or red. Biofluorescence is often confused with the following forms of biotic light: bioluminescence and biophosphorescence.

==Bioluminescence==
Bioluminescence differs from biofluorescence in that it is the natural production of light by chemical reactions within an organism, whereas biofluorescence and biophosphorescence are the absorption and reemission of light from the natural environment.

==Biophosphorescence==
Biophosphorescence is similar to biofluorescence in its requirement of light at specified wavelengths as a provider of excitation energy. The difference here lies in the relative stability of the energized electron. Unlike with biofluorescence, here the electron retains stability in the forbidden triplet state (unpaired spins), with a longer delay in emitting light resulting in the effect that it continues to “glow-in-the-dark” even long after the stimulating light source has been removed.
==Biolasing==
A biolaser is when laser light is generated by or from within a living cell. Imaging in biophotonics often relies on laser light, and integration with biological systems is seen as a promising route to enhancing sensing and imaging techniques. Biolasers, like any laser system, requires three components gain medium, optical feedback structure and pump source. For the gain medium, a variety of naturally produced fluorescent proteins can be used in different laser structure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gather |first1=Malte C. |last2=Yun |first2=Seok Hyun |title=Single-cell biological lasers |journal=Nature Photonics |date=12 June 2011 |volume=5 |issue=7 |pages=406–410 |doi=10.1038/NPHOTON.2011.99}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Enclosing an optical feedback structure in a cell has been demonstrated using cell vacuoles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Humar |first1=Matjaž |last2=Hyun Yun |first2=Seok |title=Intracellular microlasers |journal=Nature Photonics |date=27 July 2015 |volume=9 |issue=9 |page=572 |doi=10.1038/NPHOTON.2015.129}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as using fully enclosed laser systems such as dye doped polymer microspheres&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schubert |first1=Marcel |last2=Steude |first2=Anja |last3=Liehm |first3=Philipp |last4=Kronenberg |first4=Nils M. |last5=Karl |first5=Markus |last6=Campbell |first6=Elaine C. |last7=Powis |first7=Simon J. |last8=Gather |first8=Malte C. |title=Lasing within Live Cells Containing Intracellular Optical Microresonators for Barcode-Type Cell Tagging and Tracking |journal=Nano Letters |date=21 July 2015 |volume=15 |issue=8 |pages=5647–5652 |doi=10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b02491}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or semiconductor nanodisks lasers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fikouras |first1=Alasdair H. |last2=Schubert |first2=Marcel |last3=Karl |first3=Markus |last4=Kumar |first4=Jothi D. |last5=Powis |first5=Simon J. |last6=Di Falco |first6=Andrea |last7=Gather |first7=Malte C. |title=Non-obstructive intracellular nanolasers |journal=Nature Communications |date=16 November 2018 |volume=9 |issue=1 |doi=10.1038/s41467-018-07248-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Light sources==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}
The predominantly used light sources are [[beam light]]s.  [[LED]]s and [[superluminescent diode]]s also play an important role. Typical wavelengths used in biophotonics are between 600&amp;nbsp;nm (Visible) and 3000&amp;nbsp;nm (near [[infra-red|IR]]).

===Lasers===

[[Lasers]] play an increasingly important role in biophotonics. Their unique intrinsic properties like precise wavelength selection, widest wavelength coverage, highest focusability and thus best spectral resolution, strong power densities and broad spectrum of excitation periods make them the most universal light tool for a wide spectrum of applications. As a consequence a variety of different laser technologies from a broad number of suppliers can be found in the market today.

====Gas lasers====

Major gas lasers used for biophotonics applications, and their most important wavelengths, are:

- [[Argon Ion laser]]: 457.8&amp;nbsp;nm, 476.5&amp;nbsp;nm, 488.0&amp;nbsp;nm, 496.5&amp;nbsp;nm, 501.7&amp;nbsp;nm, 514.5&amp;nbsp;nm (multi-line operation possible)

- [[Krypton Ion laser]]: 350.7&amp;nbsp;nm, 356.4&amp;nbsp;nm, 476.2&amp;nbsp;nm, 482.5&amp;nbsp;nm, 520.6&amp;nbsp;nm, 530.9&amp;nbsp;nm, 568.2&amp;nbsp;nm, 647.1&amp;nbsp;nm, 676.4&amp;nbsp;nm, 752.5&amp;nbsp;nm, 799.3&amp;nbsp;nm

- [[Helium–neon laser]]: 632.8&amp;nbsp;nm (543.5&amp;nbsp;nm, 594.1&amp;nbsp;nm, 611.9&amp;nbsp;nm)

- [[HeCd lasers]]: 325&amp;nbsp;nm, 442&amp;nbsp;nm

Other commercial gas lasers like carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide, nitrogen, oxygen, xenon-ion, excimer or metal vapor lasers have no or only very minor importance in biophotonics.
Major advantage of gas lasers in biophotonics is their fixed wavelength, their perfect beam quality and their low linewidth/high coherence. Argon ion lasers can also operate in multi-line mode. Major disadvantage are high power consumption, generation of mechanical noise due to fan cooling and limited laser powers. Key suppliers are Coherent, CVI/Melles Griot, JDSU, Lasos, LTB and Newport/Spectra Physics.

====Diode lasers====

The most commonly integrated [[laser diodes]], which are used for [[diode lasers]] in biophotonics are based either on GaN or GaAs semiconductor material. GaN covers a wavelength spectrum from 375 to 488&amp;nbsp;nm (commercial products at 515 have been announced recently) whereas GaAs covers a wavelength spectrum starting from 635&amp;nbsp;nm.

Most commonly used wavelengths from diode lasers in biophotonics are: 375, 405, 445, 473, 488, 515, 640, 643, 660, 675, 785&amp;nbsp;nm.

Laser Diodes are available in 4 classes:

- Single edge emitter/broad stripe/broad area

- Surface emitter/VCSEL

- Edge emitter/Ridge waveguide

- Grating stabilized (FDB, DBR, ECDL)

For biophotonic applications, the most commonly used laser diodes are edge emitting/ridge waveguide diodes, which are single transverse mode and can be optimized to an almost perfect TEM00 beam quality. Due to the small size of the resonator, digital modulation can be very fast (up to 500&amp;nbsp;MHz). Coherence length is low (typically &lt; 1&amp;nbsp;mm) and the typical linewidth is in the nm-range. Typical power levels are around 100&amp;nbsp;mW (depending on wavelength and supplier).
Key suppliers are: [[Coherent, Inc.|Coherent]], Melles Griot, Omicron, [[Toptica]], JDSU, [[Newport Corporation (company)|Newport]], Oxxius, Power Technology.
Grating stabilized diode lasers either have an lithographical incorporated grating (DFB, DBR) or an external grating (ECDL). As a result, the coherence length will raise into the range of several meters, whereas the linewidth will drop well below picometers (pm). Biophotonic applications, which make use of this characteristics are Raman spectroscopy (requires linewidth below cm-1) and spectroscopic gas sensing.

====Solid state lasers====
'''Solid-state lasers''' are lasers based on solid-state gain media such as crystals or glasses doped with rare earth or transition metal ions, or semiconductor lasers. (Although semiconductor lasers are of course also solid-state devices, they are often not included in the term solid-state lasers.) Ion-doped solid-state lasers (also sometimes called doped insulator lasers) can be made in the form of bulk lasers, fiber lasers, or other types of waveguide lasers. Solid-state lasers may generate output powers between a few milliwatts and (in high-power versions) many kilowatts.

====Fiber lasers====
{{empty section|date=July 2011}}

====ps lasers====
{{empty section|date=July 2011}}

====Ultrafast lasers====
{{empty section|date=July 2011}}

====Ultrachrome lasers====

Many advanced applications in biophotonics require individually selectable light at multiple wavelengths. As a consequence a series of new laser technologies has been introduced, which currently looks for precise wording.

The most commonly used terminology are [[supercontinuum]] lasers, which emit visible light over a wide spectrum simultaneously. This light is then filtered e.g. via acousto-optic modulators (AOM, AOTF) into 1 or up to 8 different wavelengths. Typical suppliers for this technology was NKT Photonics or Fianium. Recently NKT Photonics bought Fianium,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nktphotonics.com/nkt-photonics-acquires-fianium/ |title=NKT Photonics acquires Fianium |date=31 March 2016 |website=NKT Photonics |access-date=2016-07-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707170034/http://www.nktphotonics.com/nkt-photonics-acquires-fianium/ |archive-date=2016-07-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; remaining the major supplier of the [[supercontinuum]] technology on the market.

In another approach (Toptica/iChrome) the supercontinuum is generated in the infra-red and then converted at a single selectable wavelength into the visible regime. This approach does not require AOTF's and has a background-free spectral purity.

Since both concepts have major importance for biophotonics the umbrella term "ultrachrome lasers" is often used.

====OPOs====
{{empty section|date=July 2011}}

====Swept sources====
Swept sources are designed to continuously change ('sweep') emitted light frequency in time. They typically continuously circle through a pre-defined range of frequencies (e.g., 800 +/- 50&amp;nbsp;nm). Swept sources in the terahertz regime have been demonstrated. A typical application of swept sources in biophotonics is [[Optical Coherence Tomography | Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Imaging]].

====THz sources====
{{empty section|date=July 2011}}

===LEDs===
{{empty section|date=July 2011}}

===SLEDs===
{{empty section|date=July 2011}}

===Lamps===
{{empty section|date=July 2011}}

===Single photon sources===
:''See [[single photon sources]]

Single photon sources are novel types of light sources distinct from coherent light sources (lasers) and thermal light sources (such as incandescent light bulbs and mercury-vapor lamps) that emit light as single particles or photons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9361">[[File:Lesnarbotch.jpg|thumb|[[Brock Lesnar]] failed to fully rotate when he performed a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Shooting star press|shooting star press]] in the main event of [[WrestleMania XIX]], resulting in a concussion.]]

To '''botch''' in [[professional wrestling]] means to attempt a scripted move or spoken line that does not come out as it was originally planned due to a mistake, miscalculation, or a slip-up. Most botches are harmless, such as a wrestler simply flubbing a line or missing a cue, or falling before his or her opponent's move actually connects. At times, however, a poorly timed or executed move has resulted in serious injury or even death.

==Causes==
A common cause of botches is inexperience. [[Jackie Gayda]], winner of the ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough 2]]'' competition, in one of her first TV matches (a tag team match with [[Christopher Nowinski]] against [[Trish Stratus]] and [[John Layfield|Bradshaw]] on the July 8, 2002 edition of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]), botched nearly every move that she tried or attempted to sell, the most infamous of which was a second-rope-[[Professional wrestling throws#Bulldog|bulldog]] by Stratus, which Gayda [[Sell (professional wrestling)|sold]] two seconds too late.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"&gt;{{cite web|title=slash Wrestling slash RAW slash 8 July 2002|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/020708.html|accessdate=2006-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 1976, [[Bruno Sammartino]] suffered a neck fracture in a match against the relatively inexperienced [[Stan Hansen]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], when Hansen improperly executed a body slam. Bruno came back eight weeks later for a rematch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=14958|last=Meltzer|first=Dave|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|title=Sanmartino|publisher=WON}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
===Injury===
Sometimes botches can be extremely dangerous and can end a wrestler's career or life. For example, [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] wrestler [[D'Lo Brown]] once botched a [[Powerbomb#Sitout powerbomb|running sitout powerbomb]] on his opponent [[Darren Drozdov|Droz]], resulting in Droz being rendered [[Tetraplegia|quadriplegic]] (although he later regained some use of his upper body). This botch was mainly caused by D'Lo not being able to get a grip on the baggy clothing worn by Droz while holding him in the powerbomb position. Droz also did not cinch himself up at the waist as is the safety measure for powerbomb receivers. In other cases, the wrestler performing the move could be injured. [[Japan]]ese wrestler [[Eiji Ezaki|Hayabusa]] botched a [[Moonsault#Springboard moonsault|springboard moonsault]] in a match against Mammoth Sasaki when his foot slipped on the second rope and he landed on his head, causing damage to his spine and neck and paralyzing him, although he regained feeling in his legs before his death in 2016.&lt;ref name="LOP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/articles/100378701249076.html|title=Hayabusa paralyzed, Bischoff responds to Jericho, Benoit update, more|accessdate=2006-10-22|date=2001-10-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227000212/http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/articles/100378701249076.html|archivedate=February 27, 2009}} {{unreliable source?|failed=y|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2001, Brian Ong was training with [[The Great Khali|Dalip Singh]] (better known as the Great Khali) and took a [[Professional wrestling throws#Flapjack|flapjack]] from Singh. The move was botched, reportedly because Ong had grabbed Singh's shirt instead of pushing off Singh's back as he was instructed. Although he had made the mistake several times before without incident, this time Ong landed [[Coccyx|tailbone]] first and his head was violently whipped back against the mat. The resulting impact caused [[Catastrophic injury|catastrophic]] damage to his spine and [[brainstem]]. Coupled with a previous concussion, the move resulted in Ong's death a few days later.&lt;ref name="Goldsmith"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/Issues/2004-01-14/news/feature_3.html |title=Mortal Combat |last=Goldsmith |first=Susan |publisher=[[East Bay Express]] |date=2004-01-14 |accessdate=2006-10-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523000841/http://www.eastbayexpress.com/issues/2004-01-14/news/feature_3.html |archivedate=2006-05-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improvising endings===
In most cases, minor botches are simply glossed over and the match is continued. One example was the ending of the [[Hulk Hogan]]-[[Sid Eudy|Sid Justice]] match at [[WrestleMania VIII]]. The planned ending was to involve [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|Papa Shango]] running into the ring to break up Hogan's pin attempt. However, Shango missed his cue, forcing Sid to kick out of the pin attempt and manager [[Bruno Lauer|Harvey Whippleman]] to jump onto the ring apron to interfere and prompt the disqualification, just as Shango ran into the ring to assist Sid with the intended double-team beating of Hogan.

Serious botches resulting in injuries often result in improvised endings to matches, or the remainder of a match will be canceled if a wrestler cannot continue or requires immediate medical attention. During the match between [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and [[Owen Hart]] at Summerslam 1997, Hart botched a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Reverse piledriver|piledriver]], breaking Austin's neck. Hart was forced to improvise an extended taunt sequence until Austin was able regain his composure and [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Roll-up|roll him up]] in a schoolboy pin, ending the match earlier than planned but with the desired winner. If a wrestler is seriously injured, the [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] normally signals the need for immediate help by doing an "X" formation with his arms over his head. In recent years, as some wrestling fans have noticed this, the referee may sometimes perform the symbol in an attempt to indicate a [[kayfabe]] injury to another performer, which will lead to the match being called off.

Botches can also involve scripted lines. During the airing of [[WrestleMania XXX]], Hulk Hogan—serving as the [[Master of ceremonies|host]] of WrestleMania—mistakenly referred to the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] to the live audience as the [[Silverdome]], the home of [[WrestleMania III]] and where Hogan had his infamous showdown with [[André the Giant]]. After Hogan corrected himself, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] would rib Hogan for calling the Superdome the Silverdome, and it ended up being a [[running gag]] for the rest of WrestleMania XXX and into the post-WrestleMania ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' the next night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/04/wrestlemania-hulk-hogan-silverdome-superdome/ | title=Hulk Hogan flubbed the name of the Superdome, and New Orleans' reaction was priceless}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive impact===
Botches can sometimes have a positive impact on a career. One (in)famous example is when [[Mick Foley]], under his ring name '''Mankind''', wrestled [[The Undertaker]] in a [[Hell in a Cell]] [[The Undertaker vs. Mankind|match]] at [[King of the Ring (1998)]]. After Foley was tossed off of the top of the cell through the announcers' table, the match was going to be stopped. However, as he was being stretchered out of the arena, Foley got off the stretcher, climbed back on top of the cell, and continued the match. The Undertaker then delivered a [[chokeslam]] to Foley on the roof of the cell, which caused one of the roof panels to give way. Foley plummeted to the mat below, dislocating his shoulder. A chair fell with him and landed on his face, knocking a tooth out through his upper lip. Foley still finished the match and gained a legendary status among wrestling fans, and has since been dubbed "The Hardcore Legend". Some people even claim that he is the toughest man alive. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/undertaker/undertakerhiac/|title=Undertaker Bio|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ECW, [[Chris Benoit]] injured [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]]'s neck with a suplex. Benoit was subsequently nicknamed The Crippler.

Sometimes botches can lead to the accidental invention of new moves. For example, the [[diving headbutt]] was invented when [[Harley Race]] botched a splash from the top rope, [[Jake Roberts|Jake "The Snake" Roberts]] claims to have invented the [[DDT (professional wrestling)|DDT]] when he was accidentally tripped by his opponent while applying a front facelock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Greg Oliver | author2= Steve Johnson | last-author-amp= yes | title= the Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame - The Heels | publisher= ECW Press | year= 2007 | chapter = Jake "the Snake" Roberts | pages = 311–315| isbn= 978-1550227598}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Toshiaki Kawada]] inadvertently invented the [[Powerbomb#Ganso bomb|Ganso bomb]], one of the most dangerous moves in wrestling, after he failed to execute a powerbomb on [[Mitsuharu Misawa]] and instead dropped his head.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4715">{{About|the fictional language|the language of the Caucasus|Chakobsa (Caucasian language)}}
'''Chakobsa''' is a fictional language used by the [[Fremen]] people of the [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' universe]] created by [[Frank Herbert]]. In the series of novels which begins with ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', the language is said to be based on another fictitious language, the ''Bhotani Jib'' (likely derived from [[Bhutan]] and referring to a dialect derived from there{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}). Herbert presumably took the name from [[Chakobsa (Caucasian language)|Chakobsa]], the "hunting language" of the Caucasus (cf. Lesley Blanch, ''The Sabres of Paradise'' (1960), p.&amp;nbsp;21), an anglicized form of [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] ''щакIуэбзэ'' /š&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;ak'&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;e-bze/ "hunter's language" (''щакIуэ'' 'hunter,' ''бзэ'' 'language').

Examples of the language from the books are actually a mixture of [[Romani language|Roma (or Gypsy) language]], from a Gypsy magic textbook Herbert used for reference, one sentence in [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croat]] and various [[Arabic Language|Arabic]] terms, with definitions altered slightly to suggest the passage of time.&lt;ref&gt;"Tolk de Chakobsa Phrases in "Dune"" in [https://fr.scribd.com/doc/260601365/Conlangs-Monthly-April-Edition ''Conlangs Monthly''], p.31, article written in the conlang [[Sambahsa]] by O.Simon.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Dune Encyclopedia''==
The non-[[canon (fiction)|canon]] ''[[The Dune Encyclopedia|Dune Encyclopedia]]'' (1984) by [[Willis E. McNelly]] includes extensive descriptions of the Fremen language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McNelly |first=Willis E. |authorlink=Willis E. McNelly |title=[[The Dune Encyclopedia]] |chapter=CHAKOBSA |date=June 1, 1984 |pages=155–156 |isbn=0-425-06813-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fremen"&gt;{{cite book |last=McNelly |title=Dune Encyclopedia |chapter=FREMEN LANGUAGE |year=1984 |pages=234–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Encyclopedia'' was approved by Herbert but rendered erroneous in some areas through Herbert's later works in the ''Dune'' series.

==2003 miniseries==
The 2003 [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] TV [[miniseries]] ''[[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune]]'' includes a song by [[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]] entitled "[[Inama Nushif]]", which is claimed to contain lyrics sung in Fremen. According to miniseries [[film director|director]] [[Greg Yaitanes]], Tyler claimed that he "searched through Herbert's books and deciphered enough of the fictional Fremen language to write this powerful song."&lt;ref name="Tyler"&gt;{{cite web |author=Brian Tyler and Greg Yaitanes |title=''Children of Dune'' |work=Discography |publisher=Official website for film composer Brian Tyler |url=http://www.briantyler.com/cd/children_of_dune.html |accessdate=2006-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516075527/http://www.briantyler.com/cd/children_of_dune.html |archivedate=2007-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in reality the song is an alteration of a speech by Muad'dib published in ''The Dune Encyclopedia'', expanded with some repetitions, and a different 'translation' attached to it. The original text's first lines are "Innama nishuf".&lt;ref name="Fremen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.hairyticksofdune.net/inamanushif.html Plagiarism of the Dune Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual example==
An example of Chakobsa is seen in the ancient funeral ritual of the Fremen in which the water of a dead tribesman is magically blessed:
"''Ekkeri-akairi, fillissin-follas. Kivi a-kavi, nakalas! Nakalas! Ukair-an ... jan, jan, jan ...'' .&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Frank. ''Dune'', pp. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

(Translation "This is the water of (the new owner). Never the more to be measured or counted by the heartbeats of (the old owner). Go, go, go...")

==Influence==
The game [[Fury of the Furries]] can be played in Chakobsa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2902">A '''commissure''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|m|ə|ʃ|ər}}) is the location at which two objects [[wikt:abut#Verb|abut]] or are joined. The term is used especially in the fields of anatomy and biology.

* The most common usage of the term refers to the brain's commissures, of which there are five. Such a commissure is a bundle of [[commissural fiber]]s as a [[nerve tract |tract]] that crosses the midline at its level of origin or entry (as opposed to a [[decussation]] of fibers that cross obliquely). The five are the [[anterior commissure]], [[posterior commissure]], [[corpus callosum]], [[Fornix (neuroanatomy)#Commissure|commissure of fornix]] (hippocampal commissure), and [[habenular commissure]]. They consist of fibre [[Neural pathway|tract]]s that connect the two [[cerebral hemisphere]]s and span the [[longitudinal fissure]]. In the spinal cord there are the [[anterior white commissure]], and the [[gray commissure]].
* ''Commissure'' also often refers to cardiac anatomy of [[heart valve]]s. In the heart, a commissure is the area where the valve leaflets abut. When such an abutment is abnormally stiffened or even fused, [[stenosis#Valvular|valvular stenosis]] results, sometimes requiring [[commissurotomy]].
* The term may also refer to the junction of the upper and lower [[lip]]s (see [[labial commissure of mouth]]).
* It may refer to the junction of the upper and lower mandibles of a [[beak|bird's beak]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Field and General Ornithology |first=Elliott |last=Coues |year=1890 |publisher=Macmillan and Co |location=London |page=155 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yU8aAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Handbook+of+Field+and+General+Ornithology#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |oclc=263166207}}&lt;/ref&gt; or alternately, to the full-length apposition of the closed mandibles, from the corners of the mouth to the tip of the beak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Campbell |editor-first= Bruce |editor2-last= Lack |editor2-first= Elizabeth |title=A Dictionary of Birds |year=1985 |publisher=T and A D Poyser |location=Carlton, England |page=105 |isbn=0-85661-039-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It may refer to the upper and lower [[eyelid]]s.
* In female genitalia, the joining points of the two folds of the labia majora create two commissures - the anterior commissure just anterior to the prepuce of the clitoris, and the posterior commissure of the labia majora, directly posterior to the frenulum of the labia minora and anterior to the perineal raphe.

In [[biology]], the meeting of the two valves of a [[brachiopod]] or [[clam]] is a commissure; in [[botany]], the term is used to denote the place where a [[fern]]'s laterally expanded vein endings come together in a continuous marginal [[sorus]].

'''Jack Kerouac''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛr|u|æ|k}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|Kerouac}}&lt;/ref&gt; born '''Jean-Louis Kérouac''' (though he called himself '''Jean-Louis Lebris de Kérouac'''); March 12, 1922 – October 21, 1969) was an American novelist and poet of French-Canadian descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kerouac|first1=Jack|title=La nuit est ma femme (in La Nouvelle Revue Française)|date=June 1996|publisher=Editions Gallimard|isbn=207074521X|url=http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/La-Nouvelle-Revue-Francaise/La-Nouvelle-Revue-Francaise424|accessdate=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kerouac|first1=Jack|title=The Unknown Kerouac: Rare, Unpublished &amp; Newly Translated Writings|date=September 15, 2016|publisher=The Library of America|location=New York|isbn=978-159853-498-6|url=https://www.loa.org/books/516-the-unknown-kerouac-rare-unpublished-newly-translated-writings|accessdate=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ellis Béchard|first1=Deni|title=On le Road: Kerouac's French-Canadian roots hold the key to his literary identity|url=https://thewalrus.ca/on-le-road/|website=The Walrus|accessdate=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Pratte| first1=Andre| title=Legacy: How French Canadians Shaped North America|date=November 8, 2016| publisher=Signal| isbn= 978-0771072413| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6HiSCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT16&amp;lpg=PT16&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| accessdate=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is considered a literary [[Iconoclasm|iconoclast]] and, alongside [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]], a pioneer of the [[Beat Generation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PNRHQ96szrsC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=kerouac+iconoclast+literary#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=The view from on the road: the rhetorical vision of Jack Kerouac|last=Swartz|first=Omar|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|year=1999 |accessdate=January 29, 2010|page=4|isbn=978-0-8093-2384-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerouac is recognized for his method of spontaneous prose. Thematically, his work covers topics such as [[Catholic spirituality]], [[jazz]], [[promiscuity]], [[Buddhism]], drugs, poverty, and travel. He became an underground celebrity and, with other [[Beat Generation|beats]], a [[progenitor]] of the [[History of the hippie movement|hippie movement]], although he remained antagonistic toward some of its politically radical elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dean |first=Robert |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-conservative-kerouac/ |title=The Conservative Kerouac |publisher=The American Conservative |date=September 7, 2012 |accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Countering the Counterculture: Rereading Postwar American Dissent from Jack Kerouac to Tomás Rivera |last=Martinez |first=Manuel Luis |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-299-19284-6 |page=26 |quote=Kerouac appeared to have done an about-face, becoming extraordinarily reactionary and staunchly anticommunist, vocalizing his intense hatred of the 1960s counterculture ...}}; ''id''. at p. 29 ("Kerouac realized where his basic allegiance lay and vehemently disassociated himself from hippies and revolutionaries and deemed them unpatriotic subversives."); ''id''. at p. 30 ("Kerouac['s] ... attempt to play down any perceived responsibility on his part for the hippie generation, whose dangerous activism he found repellent and "delinquent."); ''id''. at p. 111 ("Kerouac saw the hippies as mindless, communistic, rude, unpatriotic and soulless."); {{citation |title=Kerouac: His Life and Work |last1=Maher |first1=Paul |last2=Amram |first2=David |publisher=Taylor Trade Publications |year=2007 |quote=In the current political climate, Kerouac wrote, he had nowhere to turn, as he liked neither the hippies ... nor the upper-echelon ...|page=469 |isbn=9781589793668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, at age 47, Kerouac died from an abdominal hemorrhage caused by a lifetime of heavy drinking. Since his death, Kerouac's literary prestige has grown, and several previously unseen works have been published. All of his books are in print today, including ''[[The Town and the City]]'', ''[[On the Road]]'', ''[[Doctor Sax]]'', ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'', ''[[Mexico City Blues]]'', ''[[The Subterraneans]]'', ''[[Desolation Angels (novel)|Desolation Angels]]'', ''[[Visions of Cody]]'', ''[[The Sea Is My Brother]]'', and ''[[Big Sur (novel)|Big Sur]]''.

==Biography==
===Early life and adolescence===
[[Image:Jack Kerouac's birthplace, 9 Lupine Road, Lowell MA.jpg|thumb|left|Jack Kerouac's birthplace, 9 Lupine Road, 2nd floor, West Centralville, Lowell, Massachusetts]]
Jack Kerouac was born on March 12, 1922 in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] to [[French Canadian]] parents, Léo-Alcide Kéroack (1899–1946) and Gabrielle-Ange Lévesque (1895–1973).&lt;ref&gt;Ann Charters, Samuel Charters, ''Brother-Souls: John Clellon Holmes, Jack Kerouac, and the Beat Generation'', University Press of Mississippi, 2010, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some confusion surrounding his name, partly because of variations on the spelling of Kerouac, and because of Kerouac's own statement of his name as Jean-Louis Lebris de Kerouac. His reason for that statement seems to be linked to an old family legend that the Kerouacs had descended from Baron François Louis Alexandre Lebris de Kerouac. Kerouac's baptism certificate lists his name simply as Jean Louis Kirouac, the most common spelling of the name in Quebec.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1983"&gt;{{harvnb|Nicosia|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that Kerouac's roots were indeed in [[Brittany]], and he was descended from a middle-class merchant colonist, Urbain-François Le Bihan, Sieur de [[Lanmeur|Kervoac]], whose sons married French Canadians.&lt;ref name="dagier ; Quéméner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genealogie.org/famille/kirouac/PlaquesCOMM_AN.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222185908/http://www.genealogie.org/famille/kirouac/PlaquesCOMM_AN.htm|date=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerouac's father Leo had been born into a family of potato farmers in the village of [[Saint-Hubert-de-Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec]]. Jack also had various stories on the etymology of his surname, usually tracing it to Irish, [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] or other [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] roots.

In one interview he claimed it was from the name of the Cornish language (''Kernewek'') and that the Kerouacs had fled from Cornwall to [[Brittany]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan M Kent]], ''Celtic Cornwall: Nation, Tradition, Invention.'' Halsgrove, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Another version was that the Kerouacs had come to Cornwall from Ireland before the time of Christ and the name meant "language of the house".&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Dittman, Jack Kerouac: A Biography, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In still another interview he said it was an Irish word for "language of the water" and related to ''Kerwick''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Berrigan, Ted |authorlink=Ted Berrigan |url=http://www.parisreview.com/media/4260_KEROUAC.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Art of Fiction No. 43: Jack Kerouac, pg. 49 |work=[[The Paris Review]] |year=1968 |accessdate=May 14, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528025958/http://www.parisreview.com/media/4260_KEROUAC.pdf |archivedate=May 28, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerouac, derived from ''Kervoach'', is the name of a town in [[Brittany]] in [[Lanmeur]], near [[Morlaix]].&lt;ref name="dagier ; Quéméner"&gt;{{harvnb|Dagier|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Jack Kerouac's 3rd home, 34 Beaulieu.jpg|thumb|left|His third of several homes growing up in the West Centralville section of Lowell]]
Jack Kerouac later referred to 34 Beaulieu Street as "sad Beaulieu". The Kerouac family was living there in 1926 when Jack's older brother Gerard died of [[rheumatic fever]], aged nine. This deeply affected four-year-old Jack, who would later say that Gerard followed him in life as a [[guardian angel]]. This is the Gerard of Kerouac's novel ''[[Visions of Gerard]]''. He had one other sibling, an older sister named Caroline. Kerouac was referred to as Ti Jean or little John around the house during his childhood.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1983"/&gt;

Kerouac spoke French until he learned English at age six; he did not speak English confidently until his late teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sandison|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a serious child who was devoted to his mother, who played an important role in his life. She was a devout [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], who instilled this deep faith into both her sons.&lt;ref name="culturewars.com"&gt;Fellows, Mark [http://www.culturewars.com/CultureWars/1999/kerouac.html The Apocalypse of Jack Kerouac: Meditations on the 30th Anniversary of his Death], Culture Wars Magazine, November 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Kerouac would later say that his mother was the only woman he ever loved.&lt;ref name="beatmuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatmuseum.org/kerouac/jackkerouac.html |title=Jack Kerouac – bio and links |publisher=Beatmuseum.org |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Gerard died, his mother sought solace in her faith, while his father abandoned it, wallowing in drinking, gambling, and smoking.&lt;ref name="culturewars.com"/&gt;

Some of Kerouac's poetry was written in French, and in letters written to friend [[Allen Ginsberg]] towards the end of his life, he expressed a desire to speak his parents' native tongue again. In 2016, a whole volume of previously unpublished works originally written in French by Kerouac was published as ''La vie est d'hommage'', edited by Professor Jean-Christophe Cloutier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.editionsboreal.qc.ca/catalogue/livres/vie-est-hommage-2490.html|title=La vie est d'hommage|website=editionsboreal.qc.ca|access-date=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 1928, while six years old, Kerouac had his first [[Confession (religion)|Confession]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Amburn, Ellis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bN0PJn6VCNIC&amp;pg Subterranean Kerouac: The Hidden Life of Jack Kerouac], p. 13-14 , MacMillan 1999&lt;/ref&gt; For [[penance]] he was told to say a [[rosary]], during which he heard God tell him that he had a good soul, that he would suffer in life and [[Jack Kerouac#Death|die in pain and horror]], but would in the end receive salvation.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; This experience, along with his dying brother's vision of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] (as the nuns fawned over him, convinced he was a saint), combined with a later study of Buddhism and an ongoing commitment to Christ, solidified the worldview which would inform Kerouac's work.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

Kerouac once told [[Ted Berrigan]], in an interview for ''[[The Paris Review]]'', of an incident in the 1940s in which his mother and father were walking together in a Jewish neighborhood on the [[Lower East Side]] of New York. He recalled "a whole bunch of [[rabbi]]s walking arm in arm&amp;nbsp;... teedah- teedah – teedah&amp;nbsp;... and they wouldn't part for this Christian man and his wife, so my father went POOM! and knocked a rabbi right in the gutter."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1998|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berrigan|1968|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leo, after the death of his child, also treated a priest with similar contempt, angrily throwing him out of the house despite his invitation from Gabrielle.&lt;ref name="culturewars.com"/&gt;

Kerouac's athletic skills as a running back in [[American football|football]] for [[Lowell High School (Massachusetts)|Lowell High School]] earned him scholarship offers from [[Boston College]], [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], and [[Columbia University]]. He entered [[Columbia University]] after spending a year at [[Horace Mann School]], where he earned the requisite grades for entry to Columbia. Kerouac broke a leg playing football during his freshman season, and during an abbreviated second year he argued constantly with coach [[Lou Little]], who kept him benched.  While at Columbia, Kerouac wrote several sports articles for the student newspaper, the ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'', and joined the [[Phi Gamma Delta]] fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phi Gamma Delta|url=http://www.wikicu.com/Phi_Gamma_Delta|publisher=Wiki CU|accessdate=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Beat Generation in New York: A Walking Tour of Jack Kerouac's City| url=https://books.google.com/?id=-nt1xVR4SrAC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=fraternity+of+Phi+Gamma+Delta+kerouac#v=onepage&amp;q=fraternity%20of%20Phi%20Gamma%20Delta%20kerouac&amp;f=false| publisher=City Lights Books| accessdate=July 23,  2011| isbn=978-0872863255| year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied at [[The New School]].&lt;ref name=hpo&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Joyce|title=How the 'Beat Generation' Got Away from Kerouac|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joycejohnson/how-the-beat-generation-g_b_1958500.html|work=HuffPost|date=November 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early adulthood===
[[File:Jack Kerouac Naval Reserve Enlistment, 1943.png|thumb|Kerouac's Naval Reserve Enlistment photograph, 1943]]
When his football career at Columbia ended, Kerouac dropped out of the university. He continued to live for a time in New York's [[Upper West Side]] with his girlfriend and future first wife, [[Edie Parker]]. It was during this time that he met the [[Beat Generation]] people—now famous—with whom he would always be associated, and who as characters formed the basis of many of his novels, including: [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Neal Cassady]], [[John Clellon Holmes]], [[Herbert Huncke]], [[Lucien Carr]] and [[William S. Burroughs]].

Kerouac joined the [[United States Merchant Marine]] in 1942 and in 1943 joined the [[United States Navy]], but served only eight days of active duty before arriving on the sick list. According to his medical report, Kerouac said he "asked for an aspirin for his headaches and they diagnosed me [[dementia praecox]] and sent me here." The medical examiner reported that Kerouac's military adjustment was poor, quoting Kerouac: "I just can't stand it; I like to be by myself." Two days later he was honorably discharged on psychiatric grounds (he was of "indifferent character" with a diagnosis of "[[Schizoid personality disorder|schizoid personality]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0906052_jack_kerouac_1.html|title=Hit The Road, Jack|work=[[The Smoking Gun]]|date=September 5, 2005|accessdate=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While serving in the [[United States Merchant Marine]], Kerouac wrote his first novel, ''[[The Sea Is My Brother]]''. Although written in 1942, the book was not published until 2011, some 42 years after Kerouac's death and 70 years after it was written. Kerouac described the work as being about "man's simple revolt from society as it is, with the inequalities, frustration, and self-inflicted agonies." He viewed the work as a failure, calling it a "crock as literature", and he never actively sought to publish it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/25/kerouacs-lost-debut-novel-published |title=Kerouac's Lost Debut Novel Published |work=The Guardian |date= November 25, 2011|accessdate=December 6, 2011 |location=London |first=Stephen |last=Bates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, Kerouac was arrested as a [[material witness]] in the murder of David Kammerer, who had been stalking Kerouac's friend [[Lucien Carr]] since Carr was a teenager in St. Louis. William Burroughs was also a native of St. Louis, and it was through Carr that Kerouac came to know both Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg. According to Carr, Kammerer's homosexual obsession turned aggressive, finally provoking Carr to stab him to death in self-defense. Carr dumped the body in the [[Hudson River]]. Afterwards, Carr sought help from Kerouac. Kerouac disposed of the murder weapon and buried Kammerer's eyeglasses. Carr, encouraged by Burroughs, turned himself in to the police. Kerouac and Burroughs were later arrested as material witnesses. Kerouac's father refused to pay his bail. Kerouac then agreed to marry [[Edie Parker]] if her parents would pay the bail. (Their marriage was annulled in 1948.)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knight|1996|pp=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerouac and Burroughs collaborated on a novel about the Kammerer killing entitled ''[[And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks]]''. Though the book was not published during their lifetimes, an excerpt eventually appeared in ''Word Virus: A William S. Burroughs Reader'' (and as noted below, the novel was finally published late 2008). Kerouac also later wrote about the killing in his novel ''[[Vanity of Duluoz]]''.

Later, Kerouac lived with his parents in the [[Ozone Park, Queens|Ozone Park]] neighborhood of [[Queens]], after they had also moved to New York. He wrote his first published novel, ''[[The Town and the City]]'', and began the famous ''[[On the Road]]'' around 1949 while living there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fenton, Patrick |url=http://www.wordsareimportant.com/ozonepark.htm |title=The wizard of Ozone Park |work=Dharma Beat |year=1997 |accessdate=May 27, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225101624/http://www.wordsareimportant.com/ozonepark.htm |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His friends jokingly called him "The Wizard of Ozone Park", alluding to [[Thomas Edison]]'s nickname, "the Wizard of Menlo Park", and to the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kilgannon, Corey |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/10/nyregion/10ink.html|title=On the Road, the One Called Cross Bay Boulevard|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 10, 2005|accessdate=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career: 1950–1957===
[[Image:Jacks house3.JPG|thumb|Jack Kerouac lived with his parents for a time above a corner drug store in Ozone Park (now a flower shop),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;num=100&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22LITTLE+SHOPPE+OF+FLOWERS%22+%22Ozone+Park%22+Queens+%22New+York%22&amp;fb=1&amp;split=1&amp;gl=us&amp;cid=0,0,6055163161404423961&amp;ei=rL37SfO0BZmSswOXo731AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_result&amp;ct=image&amp;resnum=1 |title=LITTLE SHOPPE OF FLOWERS" "Ozone Park" Queens "New York|publisher=Google Maps |date=January 1, 1970 |accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while writing some of his earliest work.]]

''[[The Town and the City]]'' was published in 1950 under the name "John Kerouac" and, though it earned him a few respectable reviews, the book sold poorly. Heavily influenced by Kerouac's reading of [[Thomas Wolfe]], it reflects on the generational epic formula and the contrasts of small town life versus the multi-dimensional, and larger life of the city. The book was heavily edited by [[Robert Giroux]], with around 400 pages taken out.

[[File:Jack Kerouac House, New York City, NY.jpg|thumb|454 West 20th Street]]
For the next six years, Kerouac continued to write regularly. Building upon previous drafts tentatively titled "The Beat Generation" and "Gone on the Road," Kerouac completed what is now known as ''[[On the Road]]'' in April 1951, while living at 454 West 20th Street in Manhattan with his second wife, Joan Haverty.&lt;ref name="epic"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wolf, Stephen |url=http://www.thevillager.com/villager_238/anepic.html|title=An epic journey through the life of Jack Kerouac|work=[[The Villager (Manhattan)|The Villager]]|date=November 21–27, 2007|accessdate=May 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was largely autobiographical and describes Kerouac's road-trip adventures across the United States and Mexico with [[Neal Cassady]] in the late 40s and early 50s, as well as his relationships with other Beat writers and friends.  He completed the first version of the novel during a three-week extended session of spontaneous confessional prose.  Kerouac wrote the final draft in 20 days, with Joan, his wife, supplying him with benzedrine, cigarettes, bowls of pea soup and mugs of coffee to keep him going.&lt;ref name="amburn"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Amburn, Ellis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bN0PJn6VCNIC&amp;pg=PA164|title=Subterranean Kerouac: the hidden life of Jack Kerouac|date=October 5, 1999|accessdate=September 28, 2010|isbn=9780312206772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before beginning, Kerouac cut sheets of tracing paper&lt;ref name="sante"&gt;{{cite news|author=Sante, Luc |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/books/review/Sante2-t-1.html|title=On the Road Again|work=The New York Times|date=August 19, 2007|accessdate=May 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; into long strips, wide enough for a typewriter, and taped them together into a {{convert|120|ft|m|adj=on}} long roll which he then fed into the machine. This allowed him to type continuously without the interruption of reloading pages. The resulting manuscript contained no chapter or paragraph breaks and was much more explicit than the version which would eventually be published.  Though "spontaneous," Kerouac had prepared long in advance before beginning to write.&lt;ref name="allthings"&gt;{{cite web|author=Shea, Andrea |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14112461|title=Jack Kerouac's Famous Scroll, 'On the Road' Again|publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]]|date=July 5, 2007|accessdate=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, according to his Columbia professor and mentor [[Mark Van Doren]], he had outlined much of the work in his journals over the several preceding years.

Though the work was completed quickly, Kerouac had a long and difficult time finding a publisher. Before ''On the Road'' was accepted by Viking Press, Kerouac got a job as a "railroad brakeman and fire lookout" (see [[Desolation Peak (Washington)]]) traveling between the East and West coasts of the United States to earn money, frequently finding rest and the quiet space necessary for writing at the home of his mother. While employed in this way he met and befriended Abe Green, a young freight train jumper who later introduced Kerouac to [[Herbert Huncke]], a Times Square street hustler and favorite of many [[Beat Generation]] writers. During this period of travel, Kerouac wrote what he considered to be "his life's work": ''[[Vanity of Duluoz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Charters|Charters, Ann]]. "Jack Kerouac."

Publishers rejected ''On the Road'' because of its experimental writing style and its sexual content. Many editors were also uncomfortable with the idea of publishing a book that contained what were, for the era, graphic descriptions of drug use and homosexual behavior—a move that could result in obscenity charges being filed, a fate that later befell Burroughs' ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' and Ginsberg's ''[[Howl]]''.

According to Kerouac, ''On the Road'' "was really a story about two Catholic buddies roaming the country in search of God. And we found him. I found him in the sky, in Market Street San Francisco (those 2 visions), and Dean (Neal) had God sweating out of his forehead all the way. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OUT FOR THE HOLY MAN: HE MUST SWEAT FOR GOD. And once he has found Him, the Godhood of God is forever Established and really must not be spoken about."&lt;ref name="culturewars.com"/&gt; According to his biographer, historian [[Douglas Brinkley]], ''On the Road'' has been misinterpreted as a tale of companions out looking for kicks, but the most important thing to comprehend is that Kerouac was an American Catholic author – for example, virtually every page of his diary bore a sketch of a crucifix, a prayer, or an appeal to Christ to be forgiven.&lt;ref name="weekendedition"&gt;{{cite web|author=Vitale, Tom |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14112461|title= 'On the Road' at 50|publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]]|date=September 1, 2007|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1951, while pregnant, Joan Haverty left and divorced Kerouac.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knight|1996|pp=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1952, she gave birth to Kerouac's only child, [[Jan Kerouac]], though he refused to acknowledge her as his daughter until a blood test confirmed it 9 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dictionary of Literary Biography |url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/jan-kerouac-dlb/|title=Jan Kerouac Biography|work=[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]|accessdate=May 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next several years Kerouac continued writing and traveling, taking long trips through the U.S. and Mexico. He often experienced episodes of heavy drinking and depression. During this period, he finished drafts of what would become ten more novels, including ''[[The Subterraneans]]'', ''[[Doctor Sax]]'', ''[[Tristessa]]'', and ''[[Desolation Angels (novel)|Desolation Angels]]'', which chronicle many of the events of these years.

In 1953, he lived mostly in New York City, having a brief but passionate affair with an African-American woman. This woman was the basis for the character named "Mardou" in the novel ''The Subterraneans''. At the request of his editors, Kerouac changed the setting of the novel from New York to San Francisco.{{original research inline|date=March 2018}}
  
In 1954, Kerouac discovered Dwight Goddard's ''A Buddhist Bible'' at the [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] Library, which marked the beginning of his study of [[Buddhism]]. However, Kerouac had earlier taken an interest in Eastern thought. In 1946 he read Heinrich Zimmer's ''Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization''. In 1955, Kerouac wrote a biography of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], titled ''Wake Up: A Life of the Buddha'', which was unpublished during his lifetime, but eventually serialized in ''[[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]]'', 1993–95. It was published by Viking in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=''Wake Up!'' on Amazon.com|asin = 0670019577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jack Kerouac House - Orlando Florida.jpg|thumb|House in [[College Park (Orlando)|College Park]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] where Kerouac lived and wrote ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'']]

Kerouac found enemies on both sides of the political spectrum, the right disdaining his association with drugs and sexual libertinism and the left contemptuous of his anti-communism and Catholicism; characteristically, he watched the 1954 Senate [[Army–McCarthy hearings|McCarthy hearings]] smoking marijuana and rooting for the anti-communist crusader, Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]].&lt;ref name="culturewars.com"/&gt; In ''Desolation Angels'' he wrote, "when I went to Columbia all they tried to teach us was [[Karl Marx|Marx]], as if I cared" (considering Marxism, like [[Sigmund Freud|Freudianism]], to be an illusory tangent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=James Terence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q08cuo8-7ggC&amp;dq |title=The Catholic Counterculture in America, 1933–1962|pages=216, 237|publisher=UNC Press|year=2001|isbn=9780807849491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, after being rejected by several other publishers, ''On the Road'' was finally purchased by [[Viking Press]], which demanded major revisions prior to publication.&lt;ref name="allthings"/&gt; Many of the more sexually explicit passages were removed and, fearing [[Defamation|libel]] suits, pseudonyms were used for the book's "characters."  These revisions have often led to criticisms of the alleged spontaneity of Kerouac's style.&lt;ref name="sante"/&gt;

===Later career: 1957–1969===
In July 1957, Kerouac moved to a small house at 1418½ Clouser Avenue in the [[College Park (Orlando)|College Park]] section of [[Orlando, Florida]], to await the release of ''On the Road''. Weeks later, a review of the book by Gilbert Millstein appeared in ''The New York Times'' proclaiming Kerouac the voice of a new generation.&lt;ref name="nytreview"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerouac was hailed as a major American writer. His friendship with Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs and [[Gregory Corso]], among others, became a notorious representation of the Beat Generation. The term Beat Generation was invented by Kerouac during a conversation held with fellow novelist [[Herbert Huncke]]. Huncke used the term "beat" to describe a person with little money and few prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jack-Kerouac|title=Jack Kerouac {{!}} Biography &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I'm beat to my socks", he had said. Kerouac's fame came as an unmanageable surge that would ultimately be his undoing.

Kerouac's novel is often described as the defining work of the post-World War II [[Beat Generation]] and Kerouac came to be called "the king of the beat generation,"&lt;ref name="King"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term with which he never felt comfortable. He once observed, "I'm not a beatnik. I'm a Catholic", showing the reporter a painting of [[Pope Paul VI]] and saying, "You know who painted that? Me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/09/07/home/kerouac-obit.html |title=Jack Kerouac Obituary |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of ''On the Road'' brought Kerouac instant fame. His celebrity status brought publishers desiring unwanted manuscripts that were previously rejected before its publication.&lt;ref name="beatmuseum.org"/&gt; After nine months, he no longer felt safe in public. He was badly beaten by three men outside the [[San Remo Cafe]] at 189 [[Bleecker Street]] in New York City one night. [[Neal Cassady]], possibly as a result of his new notoriety as the central character of the book, was set up and arrested for selling marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suiter|2002|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berrigan|1968|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Kerouac chronicled parts of his own experience with Buddhism, as well as some of his adventures with [[Gary Snyder]] and other San Francisco-area poets, in ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'', set in California and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and published in 1958. It was written in Orlando between November 26&lt;ref name="suiter"&gt;{{harvnb|Suiter|2002|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; and December 7, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suiter|2002|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; To begin writing ''Dharma Bums'', Kerouac typed onto a ten-foot length of teleprinter paper, to avoid interrupting his flow for paper changes, as he had done six years previously for ''On the Road''.&lt;ref name="suiter"/&gt;

Kerouac was demoralized by criticism of ''Dharma Bums'' from such respected figures in the American field of Buddhism as Zen teachers [[Ruth Fuller Sasaki]] and [[Alan Watts]].  He wrote to Snyder, referring to a meeting with [[D. T. Suzuki]], that "even Suzuki was looking at me through slitted eyes as though I was a monstrous imposter."  He passed up the opportunity to reunite with Snyder in California, and explained to [[Philip Whalen]], "I'd be ashamed to confront you and Gary now I've become so decadent and drunk and don't give a shit.  I'm not a Buddhist any more."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suiter|2002|pp=242–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; In further reaction to their criticism, he quoted part of Abe Green's café recitation, ''Thrasonical Yawning in the Abattoir of the Soul'': "A gaping, rabid congregation, eager to bathe, are washed over by the Font of Euphoria, and bask like protozoans in the celebrated light." Many consider that this clearly indicated Kerouac's journey on an emotional roller coaster of unprecedented adulation and spiritual demoralization.

Kerouac also wrote and narrated a beat movie titled ''[[Pull My Daisy]]'' (1959), directed by [[Robert Frank]] and [[Alfred Leslie]]. It starred poets [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Gregory Corso]], musician [[David Amram]] and painter [[Larry Rivers]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photoeye.com/magazine/reviews/2008/05_21_pull_my_daisy.cfm|title=Is Pull My Daisy Holy?|date=August 8, 2008|accessdate=September 13, 2013|first=John|last=Cohen|publisher=photo-eye Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally to be called ''The Beat Generation'', the title was changed at the last moment when [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] released a [[The Beat Generation|film by the same name]] in July 1959 that sensationalized beatnik culture.

The [[CBS|CBS Television]] series ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'' (1960–1964), featuring two untethered young men "on the road" in a [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] seeking adventure and fueling their travels by apparently plentiful temporary jobs in the various U.S. locales framing the anthology-styled stories, gave the impression of being a commercially sanitized misappropriation of Kerouac's story model for ''On the Road''.&lt;ref name="Southern Illinois University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mills|first1=Katie|title=The Road Story and the Rebel; Moving Through FIlm, Fiction and television|date=2006|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=IL, USA|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KsfXQbGmBKsC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=cbs+route+66+vs+kerouac#v=onepage&amp;q=cbs%20route%2066%20vs%20kerouac&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 25, 2017|isbn=9780809388172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the leads, Buz and Todd, bore a resemblance to the dark, athletic Kerouac and the blonde Cassady/Moriarty, respectively. Kerouac felt he'd been conspicuously ripped off by ''Route 66'' creator [[Stirling Silliphant]] and sought to sue him, CBS, the [[Screen Gems]] TV production company, and sponsor Chevrolet, but was somehow counseled against proceeding with what looked like a very potent cause of action.&lt;ref name="Southern Illinois University Press"/&gt;

John Antonelli's 1985 documentary ''Kerouac, the Movie'' begins and ends with footage of Kerouac reading from ''[[On the Road]]'' and ''[[Visions of Cody]]'' on ''The [[Steve Allen]] Plymouth Show'' in November 1959.  Kerouac appears intelligent but shy. "Are you nervous?" asks Steve Allen. "Naw," says Kerouac, sweating and fidgeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LLpNKo09Xk|title=Jack Kerouac on The Steve Allen Plymouth Show (1959)|date=November 13, 2008|accessdate=October 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, he met the poet [[Youenn Gwernig]] who was a [[Breton American]] like him in New York, and they became friends.  Gwernig used to translate his Breton language poems in English in order to make Kerouac read and understand them : "Meeting with Jack Kerouac in 1965, for instance, was a decisive turn. Since he could not speak Breton he asked me : 'Would you not write some of your poems in English? I'd really like to read them ! ... ' So I wrote an Diri Dir – Stairs of Steel for him, and kept on doing so. That's why I often write my poems in Breton, French and English."&lt;ref&gt;''Un dornad plu'', Youenn Gwernig, Al Liamm, 1997, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, Kerouac suffered the loss of his older sister to a heart attack in 1964 and his mother suffered a paralyzing stroke in 1966. In 1968, [[Neal Cassady]] also died while in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Brinkley|Brinkley, Douglas]], ed. ''Kerouac: Road Novels 1957–1960''. New York: The Library of America, 2007. pp. 844–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1968, he appeared on the television show ''[[Firing Line (TV series)|Firing Line]]'' produced and hosted by [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] (a friend of Kerouac's from his college years). Kerouac talked about the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] in what would be his last appearance on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.uml.edu/sgallagher/Buckley.html |title=Digital Beats : Jack Kerouac |publisher=Faculty.uml.edu |accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
At eleven o'clock, on the morning of October 20, 1969, in St. Petersburg, Florida, Kerouac was sitting in his favorite chair drinking whiskey and malt liquor, working on a book about his father's print shop in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. He suddenly felt nauseated and walked to the bathroom, where he began to vomit blood. Kerouac was taken to a nearby hospital, suffering from an abdominal hemorrhage. He received several transfusions in an attempt to make up for the loss of blood, and doctors subsequently attempted surgery, but a damaged liver prevented his blood from clotting. He died at 5:15 the following morning at St. Anthony's Hospital, never having regained consciousness after the operation. His cause of death was listed as an internal hemorrhage (bleeding [[esophageal varices]]) caused by [[cirrhosis]], the result of longtime alcohol abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/10/what-hollywood-gets-wrong-about-jack-kerouac-and-the-beat-generation/280612/|title=What Hollywood Gets Wrong About Jack Kerouac and the Beat Generation|last=Larson|first=Jordan|work=The Atlantic|access-date=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/football-and-the-fall-of-jack-kerouac|title=Football and the Fall of Jack Kerouac|last=Scheffler|first=Ian|date=September 6, 2013|work=The New Yorker|access-date=September 12, 2017|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible contributing factor was an untreated hernia he suffered in a bar fight several weeks earlier.&lt;ref name="collegian"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digitalnewspapers.libraries.psu.edu/Default/Skins/BasicArch/Client.asp?Skin=BasicArch&amp;&amp;AppName=2&amp;enter=true&amp;BaseHref=DCG/1969/10/22&amp;EntityId=Ar00402|title=Author Kerouac Dies; Led 'Beat Generation' | work=[[The Daily Collegian]] | date=October 22, 1969 | accessdate=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/nyregion/31kerouac.html | title=For Kerouac, Off the Road and Deep into the Bottle, a Rest Stop on the Long Island Shore | work=The New York Times | date=December 31, 2006 | accessdate=December 23, 2008 | first=Corey | last=Kilgannon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Free Articles Directory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articlime.com/article135145-investigating-death-jack-kerouac.html#comment-9250 | title=Investigating the Death of Jack Kerouac | date=May 13, 2011 | accessdate=February 16, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221100012/http://articlime.com/article135145-investigating-death-jack-kerouac.html#comment-9250 | archivedate=February 21, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried at [[Edson Cemetery]], Lowell, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

At the time of his death, he was living with his third wife, Stella Sampas Kerouac, and his mother Gabrielle. Kerouac's mother inherited most of his estate.

He was honored posthumously with a [[Doctor of Letters]] degree from his hometown [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]] on June 2, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jack Kerouac Receives Posthumous Honorary Degree | url=http://www.uml.edu/News/press-releases/2007/med_advis_on_commencement_07.aspx | date=May 31, 2007 | publisher=UMass Lowell | accessdate=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
Kerouac is generally considered to be the father of the Beat movement, although he actively disliked such labels. Kerouac's method was heavily influenced by the prolific explosion of
[[Jazz]], especially the [[Bebop]] genre established by [[Charlie Parker]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Thelonious Monk]], and others. Later, Kerouac included ideas he developed from his [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] studies that began with [[Gary Snyder]]. He often referred to his style as "spontaneous prose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Tim|title=The textuality of soulwork : Jack Kerouac's quest for spontaneous prose|date=2014|isbn=978-0-472-07216-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kerouac's prose was spontaneous and purportedly without edits, he primarily wrote autobiographical novels (or ''[[roman à clef]]'') based upon actual events from his life and the people with whom he interacted.

[[Image:The air was soft the stars so fine the promise of every cobbled alley so great by Jack Kerouac - Jack Kerouac Alley.jpg|thumb|''On the Road'' excerpt in the center of [[Jack Kerouac Alley]] ]]
Many of his books exemplified this spontaneous approach, including  ''On the Road'', ''Visions of Cody'', ''Visions of Gerard'', ''Big Sur'', and ''The Subterraneans''. The central features of this writing method were the ideas of breath (borrowed from jazz and from Buddhist meditation breathing), improvising words over the inherent structures of mind and language, and limited revision. Connected with this idea of breath was the elimination of the [[Full stop|period]], substituting instead a long connecting dash. As such, the phrases occurring between dashes might resemble [[improvisation|improvisational jazz]] licks. When spoken, the words take on a certain musical rhythm and tempo.

Kerouac greatly admired and was influenced by Gary Snyder.  ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'' contains accounts of a mountain climbing trip Kerouac took with Snyder, and includes excerpts of letters from Snyder.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suiter| 2002|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; While living with Snyder outside [[Mill Valley, California]] in 1956, Kerouac worked on a book about him, which he considered calling ''Visions of Gary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suiter| 2002|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This eventually became ''Dharma Bums'', which Kerouac described as "mostly about [Snyder].")&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suiter| 2002|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; That summer, Kerouac took a job as a [[fire lookout]] on [[Desolation Peak (Washington)|Desolation Peak]] in the [[North Cascades]] in Washington, after hearing Snyder's and Whalen's stories of working as fire spotters. On Desolation Peak he'd hoped to "come face to face with God or Tathagata and find out once and for all what is the meaning of all this existence. But instead I'd come face to face with myself ... and many's the time I thought I'd die of boredom or jump off the mountain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kerouac on the Brink|url= https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2018/2/9/kerouac-on-the-brink|website=The Attic|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerouac described the experience in ''Desolation Angels'' and later in ''The Dharma Bums".

Kerouac would go on for hours, often drunk, to friends and strangers about his method.  Allen Ginsberg, initially unimpressed, would later be one of his great proponents, and it was Kerouac's free-flowing prose method that inspired the composition of Ginsberg's poem "[[Howl]]". It was at about the time of ''The Subterraneans'' that he was encouraged by Ginsberg and others to formally explain his style. Of his expositions of the Spontaneous Prose method, the most concise was ''Belief and Technique for Modern Prose'', a list of 30 "essentials".

Some believed that at times Kerouac's writing technique did not produce lively or energetic prose. [[Truman Capote]] famously said about Kerouac's work, "That's not writing, it's typing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Conversations with Capote | first = Lawrence | last = Grobel | publisher = Da Capo Press | page = 32 | isbn =  0-306-80944-3 | year = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Carolyn Cassady]] and others, he constantly rewrote and revised his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shea|first1=Andrea|title=Jack Kerouac's Famous Scroll, 'On the Road' Again|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11709924|publisher=NPR|accessdate=July 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the body of Kerouac's work has been published in English, recent research has shown that, in addition to his poetry and letters to friends and family, he also wrote unpublished works of fiction in French.  All these works, including ''La nuit est ma femme'', ''Sur le chemin'', and large sections of ''Maggie Cassidy'' (originally written in French), have now been published together in a volume entitled ''La vie est d'hommage'' (Boréal, 2016) edited by University of Pennsylvania professor Jean-Christophe Cloutier. In 1996, the ''Nouvelle Revue Française'' published excerpts and an article on "La nuit est ma femme", and scholar Paul Maher Jr., in his biography ''Kerouac: His Life and Work'''', ''''' discussed Sur le chemin's plot and characters. The novella, completed in five days in Mexico during December 1952, is a telling example of Kerouac's attempts at writing in his first language, a language he often called Canuck French. Kerouac refers to this short novel in a letter addressed to Neal Cassady (who is commonly known as the inspiration for the character Dean Moriarty) dated January 10, 1953. The published novel runs over 110 pages, having been reconstituted from six distinct files in the Kerouac archive by Professor Cloutier. Set in 1935, mostly on the East Coast, it explores some of the recurring themes of Kerouac's literature by way of a spoken word narrative. Here, as with most of his French writings, Kerouac writes with little regard for grammar or spelling, often relying on phonetics in order to render an authentic reproduction of the French-Canadian vernacular. Even though this work has the same title as one of his best known English novels, it is the original French version of an incomplete translation that would later become ''Old Bull in the Bowery'' (now published in ''The Unknown Kerouac'' from the Library of America).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loa.org/news-and-views/1107-forthcoming-from-library-of-america-summer-fall-2016|title=Forthcoming from Library of America: Summer–Fall 2016 {{!}} Library of America|website=www.loa.org|access-date=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Unknown Kerouac,'' edited by Todd Tietchen, includes Cloutier's translation of ''La nuit est ma femme'' and the completed translation of ''Sur le Chemin'' under the title ''Old Bull in the Bowery''. ''La nuit est ma femme'' was written in early 1951 and completed a few days or weeks before he began the original English version of ''On the Road'', as many scholars, such as Paul Maher Jr., Joyce Johnson, Hassan Melehy, and [[Yannis Livadas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emptymirrorbooks.com/beat/the-sardonic-pilgrimage-of-jack-kerouac.html|title=The sardonic pilgrimage of Jack Kerouac – Yannis Livadas|date=September 22, 2016|website=''emptymirrorbooks.com''|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have pointed out.

=== Influences ===
Kerouac's early writing, particularly his first novel ''[[The Town and the City]]'', was more conventional, and bore the strong influence of [[Thomas Wolfe]].  The technique Kerouac developed that later made him famous was heavily influenced by [[Jazz]], especially [[Bebop]], and later, [[Buddhism]], as well as the famous Joan Anderson letter written by Neal Cassady.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Cassady  | first =Neal  | authorlink =Neal Cassady  | title =The First Third  | publisher =Underground Press  | year= 1964  | page =387   | oclc =42789161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Diamond Sutra]] was the most important Buddhist text for Kerouac, and "probably one of the three or four most influential things he ever read".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suiter| 2002|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, he began an intensive study of this sutra, in a repeating weekly cycle, devoting one day to each of the six [[Pāramitā]]s, and the seventh to the concluding passage on [[Samādhi]].  This was his sole reading on Desolation Peak, and he hoped by this means to condition his mind to [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]], and possibly to have a vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suiter| 2002|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An often overlooked&lt;ref&gt;''To Be An Irishman Too: Kerouac's Irish Connection'', p. 371, Studies: an Irish quarterly review, Volume 92, Talbot Press., 2003&lt;/ref&gt; literary influence on Kerouac was [[James Joyce]], whose work he alludes to more than any other author.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;Begnal, Michael, [https://web.archive.org/web/20111203004051/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3362/is_2_77/ai_n28721379/ "I Dig Joyce": Jack Kerouac and Finnegans Wake], Philological Quarterly, Spring 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Kerouac had high esteem for Joyce and he often used Joyce's stream-of-consciousness technique.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Beat Literature"&gt;Hemmer, Kurt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yzVV1Hl1NvAC&amp;dq Encyclopedia of Beat Literature], p. 244, Infobase Publishing, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding ''On the Road'', he wrote in a letter to Ginsberg, "I can tell you now as I look back on the flood of language. It is like ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' and should be treated with the same gravity."&lt;ref&gt;Kerouac, Jack and Allen Ginsberg, [https://books.google.com/books?id=N5FN49R58-gC&amp;pg=PT163&amp;dq=I+can+tell+as+I+look+back+on+the+flood+of+language+it+is+like+Ulysses+and+should+be+treated+with+the+same+gravity&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1MXtTMvjLc2gnwe3hqGjCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20can%20tell%20as%20I%20look%20back%20on%20the%20flood%20of%20language%20it%20is%20like%20Ulysses%20and%20should%20be%20treated%20with%20the%20same%20gravity&amp;f=false Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg: The Letters], Penguin, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Kerouac admired Joyce's experimental use of language, as seen in his novel ''Visions of Cody'', which uses an unconventional narrative as well as a multiplicity of authorial voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Begnal|first1=Michael|title="To be an Irishman Too": Jack Kerouac's Irish Connection|journal=Irish Province of the Society of Jesus|year=2003|volume=92|issue= 368|page=372|ref=71|jstor=30095661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Jack Kerouac and his literary works had a major impact on the popular rock music of the 1960s. Artists including [[Bob Dylan]], [[the Beatles]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Grateful Dead|the Grateful Dead]], and [[The Doors]] all credit Kerouac as a significant influence on their music and lifestyles. This is especially so with members of the band The Doors, [[Jim Morrison]] and Ray Manzarek who quote Jack Kerouac and his novel ''On the Road'' as one of the band's greatest influences.&lt;ref&gt;"Jack Kerouac Biography | Jack Kerouac." Jack Kerouac. UMass Lowell, 2014. Web. April 29, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Light My Fire: My Life with The Doors'', [[Ray Manzarek]] (keyboard player of [[The Doors]]) wrote "I suppose if Jack Kerouac had never written ''On the Road'', The Doors would never have existed." The [[alternative rock]] band [[10,000 Maniacs]] wrote a song bearing his name, "Hey Jack Kerouac" on their 1987 album ''[[In My Tribe]]''.

In 1974, the [[Jack Kerouac School|Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics]] was opened in his honor by Allen Ginsberg and [[Anne Waldman]] at [[Naropa University]], a private Buddhist university in [[Boulder, Colorado]].  The school offers a BA in Writing and Literature, MFAs in Writing &amp; Poetics and Creative Writing, and a summer writing program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naropa.edu/academics/graduate/writingpoetics/index.cfm|title=The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics|publisher=[[Naropa University]]|accessdate=May 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1978 to 1992, Joy Walsh published 28 issues of a magazine devoted to Kerouac, ''[[Moody Street Irregulars]]''.
[[File:Jack Kerouac Alley street sign.jpg|thumb|[[Jack Kerouac Alley]] in [[Chinatown, San Francisco]]]]
Kerouac's French-Canadian origins inspired a 1987 [[National Film Board of Canada]] [[docudrama]] ''Jack Kerouac's Road: A Franco-American Odyssey'', directed by [[Acadians|Acadian]] poet [[Herménégilde Chiasson]].&lt;ref name="William Lawlor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawlor|first=William|title=Beat Culture: Lifestyles, Icons, and Impact|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=978-1-85109-400-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMZqLXP01e4C&amp;pg=PA109|page=109|date=May 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A street, ''rue de Jack Kérouac'', is named after him in [[Quebec City]], as well as in the hamlet of Kerouac, [[Lanmeur]], Brittany. An annual Kerouac festival was established in Lanmeur in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kerouac|url=http://www.lanmeur.fr/index.php/vivre-a-lanmeur/patrimoine/214-kerouac|accessdate=April 17, 2017|publisher=Ville de Lanmeur|language=fr-fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, the city of San Francisco named a one-way street, [[Jack Kerouac Alley]], in his honor in [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]].

In 1997, the house on Clouser Avenue where ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'' was written was purchased by a newly formed non-profit group, [[The Jack Kerouac Writers in Residence Project of Orlando, Inc.]] This group provides opportunities for aspiring writers to live in the same house in which Kerouac was inspired, with room and board covered for three months. In 1998, the Chicago Tribune published a story by journalist [[Oscar J. Corral]] that described a simmering legal dispute between Kerouac's family and the executor of daughter Jan Kerouac's estate, Gerald Nicosia. The article, citing legal documents, showed that Kerouac's estate, worth only $91 at the time of his death, was worth $10&amp;nbsp;million in 1998.

In 2007, Kerouac was awarded a posthumous honorary degree from the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uml.edu/Media/PressReleases/Commencement_2007.html|title=UMass Lowell Honors Jack Kerouac, U.S. Rep.

In 2009, the movie ''One Fast Move or I'm Gone – Kerouac's Big Sur'' was released. It chronicles the time in Kerouac's life that led to his novel ''[[Big Sur (novel)|Big Sur]]'', with actors, writers, artists, and close friends giving their insight into the book. The movie also describes the people and places on which Kerouac based his characters and settings, including the cabin in Bixby Canyon. An album released to accompany the movie, "One Fast Move or I'm Gone", features Benjamin Gibbard ([[Death Cab for Cutie]]) and Jay Farrar ([[Son Volt]]) performing songs based on Kerouac's ''Big Sur''.

In 2010, during the first weekend of October, the 25th anniversary of the literary festival "Lowell Celebrates Kerouac" was held in Kerouac's birthplace of [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. It featured walking tours, literary seminars, and musical performances focused on Kerouac's work and that of the Beat Generation.

In the 2010s, there has been a surge in films based on the [[Beat Generation]].  Kerouac has been depicted in the films ''[[Howl (2010 film)|Howl]]'' and ''[[Kill Your Darlings (2013 film)|Kill Your Darlings]]''.  A feature film version of ''[[On the Road (film)|On the Road]]'' was released internationally in 2012, and was directed by [[Walter Salles]] and produced by [[Francis Ford Coppola]].  Independent filmmaker [[Polish brothers|Michael Polish]] directed ''[[Big Sur (film)|Big Sur]]'', based on the novel, with [[Jean-Marc Barr]] cast as Kerouac.

===Poetry===
While he is best known for his novels, Kerouac is also noted for his poetry. Kerouac said that he wanted "to be considered as a jazz poet blowing a long blues in an afternoon jazz session on Sunday.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/1016 |title=Jack Kerouac- Poets.org – Poetry, Poems, Bios &amp; More |publisher=Poets.org |accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Kerouac's poems follow the style of his free-flowing, uninhibited prose, also incorporating elements of jazz and Buddhism.  "Mexico City Blues," a collection of poems published in 1959, is made up of 242 choruses following the rhythms of jazz. In much of his poetry, to achieve a jazz-like rhythm, Kerouac made use of the long dash in place of a period. Several examples of this can be seen in "Mexico City Blues":

Other well-known poems by Kerouac, such as "Bowery Blues," incorporate jazz rhythms with Buddhist themes of [[Saṃsāra]], the cycle of life and death, and [[Samadhi]], the concentration of composing the mind.&lt;ref name="poemhunter.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/bowery-blues-2/ |title=Bowery Blues by Jack Kerouac |publisher=Poemhunter.com |date=May 4, 2012 |accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, following the jazz / blues tradition, Kerouac's poetry features repetition and themes of the troubles and sense of loss experienced in life.

===Posthumous editions===
In 2007, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of ''On the Road'''s publishing, Viking issued two new editions: ''On the Road: The Original Scroll,'' and ''On the Road: 50th Anniversary Edition''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14045410/|title=Uncensored 'On the Road' to be published|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=July 26, 2006|accessdate=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Bignell, Paul  |author2=Johnson, Andrew |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/on-the-road-uncensored-discovered-kerouac-cuts-459446.html|title=On the Road (uncensored). Discovered: Kerouac 'cuts'|work=[[The Independent]]|date=July 29, 2007|accessdate=April 29, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; By far the more significant is ''Scroll,'' a transcription of the original draft typed as one long paragraph on sheets of tracing paper which Kerouac taped together to form a {{convert|120|ft|m|adj=on}} scroll. The text is more sexually explicit than Viking allowed to be published in 1957, and also uses the real names of Kerouac's friends rather than the fictional names he later substituted. [[Indianapolis Colts]] owner [[Jim Irsay]] paid $2.43&amp;nbsp;million for the original scroll and allowed an exhibition tour that concluded at the end of 2009. The other new issue, ''50th Anniversary Edition,'' is a reissue of the 40th anniversary issue under an updated title.

The Kerouac/Burroughs manuscript, ''[[And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks]]'' was published for the first time on November 1, 2008 by [[Grove Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Entertainment/2008/03/02/new_kerouac-burroughs_book_due_out/2264/|title=New Kerouac-Burroughs book due out|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=March 2, 2008|accessdate=April 29, 2008}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, a fragment of the manuscript had been published in the Burroughs compendium, ''Word Virus''.&lt;ref name="virus"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Burroughs  | first =William   | authorlink =William S. Burroughs  | title =Word virus  | publisher =Grove Press  | year= 1998  | page =576  | isbn =0-8021-1629-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Les Éditions du Boréal, a Montreal-based publishing house, obtained rights from Kerouac's estate to publish a collection of works titled ''La vie est d'hommage'' (it was released in April 2016). It includes 16 previously unpublished works, in French, including a novella, ''Sur le chemin'', ''La nuit est ma femme,'' and large sections of ''Maggie Cassidy'' originally written in French. Both ''Sur le chemin'' and ''La nuit est ma femme'' have also been translated to English by Jean-Christophe Cloutier, in collaboration with Kerouac, and were published in 2016 by the Library of America in ''The Unknown Kerouac''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/jack-kerouac-s-rare-french-novels-to-be-released-by-canadian-publishers-1.2953512 | title=Jack Kerouac's rare French novels to be released by Canadian publishers | date=February 11, 2015 | publisher=CBC/Radio-Canada | accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/unpublished-jack-kerouac-writings-to-be-released-1.2230909 | title=Unpublished Jack Kerouac writings to be released | work=Relaxnews | date=February 11, 2015 | agency=CTV News | accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ka'apor Sign Language''' (also known as '''Urubu Sign Language''' or '''Urubu–Ka'apor Sign Language''', although these are pejorative&lt;ref&gt;Ethnologue 2016&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[village sign language]] used by the small community of [[Ka'apor]] people in the Brazilian state of [[Maranhão]]. Linguist Jim Kakumasu observed in 1968 that the number of deaf people in the community was 7 out of a population of about 500.&lt;ref name=Kakumasu1968&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relatively high ratio of deafness (1 in 75) led to both hearing and deaf members of the community using the language, and most hearing children grow up bilingual in the spoken and signed languages. The current state of the language is unknown. Other Indigenous tribes in the region have also been reported to use sign languages, and to communicate between themselves using sign language [[pidgin]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Notable features of Ka'apor Sign Language are its [[object–subject–verb]] [[word order]], and its locating of the past in front of the signer and the future behind, in contrast to sign languages of European origin, including [[American Sign Language]], [[Auslan]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]]. This may represent a [[world view]] of the past as something visible, and the future as unknowable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kyle|first1=J.G.|last2=Woll|first2=Bencie|authorlink2=Bencie Woll|title=Sign language: the study of Deaf people and their language|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kakumasu noted several features which sign language linguists today recognise as common to other sign languages, such as the use of [[name sign]]s. Conditional and imperative [[grammatical mood]]s are marked by non-manual features such as a widening of the eyes and tensing of facial muscles. Questions are marked with a question sign either before or after the clause, described as "a motion of the index finger towards the referent (addressee) with a slight wrist twist."

'''"Kalki" Thiagaraja Sadasivam''' (pronounced ''"Kalki" Tyāgarājan Sadāśivam'')  (4 September 1902 – 22 November 1997&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/nov/22sad.htm Rediff on the Net:Freedom Fighter Sadasivam Dead]&lt;/ref&gt;) was an Indian [[Indian Independence Movement|freedom fighter]], [[singer]], [[journalist]] and [[film producer]] who was one of the founders, along with [[Kalki Krishnamurthy]] of the Tamil magazine [[Kalki (magazine)|Kalki]]. He is well known as the husband of famous classical carnatic singer [[M.S. Subbulakshmi]]

== Life ==

Kalki Sadasivam was born on 4 September 1902 at Aangarai in [[Tiruchirapalli District]], the third of 16 children of Tyagarajan and Mangalam Iyer. Impressed by the fiery speeches and writings of [[Lala Lajpat Rai]], [[Bipin Chandra Pal]], [[Lokamanya Tilak]] and Sri [[Aurobindo Ghosh]], Kalki Sadasivam joined the [[Indian Independence Movement|freedom movement]] at an early age and being a disciple of [[Subramaniya Siva]] desired to kill an Englishman and court imprisonment for the sake of it. As a result, he quit school and enlisted in the Bharata Samaj, serving [[Subramaniya Siva]] who was afflicted with leprosy and ardent involving himself in the Swadeshi Movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/news/ie/daily/19971122/32650403.html Sadasivam was Spartan Gandhian,PTI, 21 November 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; On listening to speeches by [[Rajaji|Rajagopalachari]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]] he later adopted [[non-violence]].

Sadasivam had two daughters named Radha and Vijaya from his first wife, Smt. Apithakuchambal, who died in 1933. In July 1936, Sadasivam met [[M.S. Subbulakshmi]], who subscribed to his ideological and political views. The two eventually married on 10 July 1940 after his first wife died. Radha later became a popular musician on her own right.

Sadasivam was also close to journalist and writer [[Kalki Krishnamurthy]] with whom he co-founded the popular magazine Kalki in 1940.

[[File:KB South Korea.svg|thumb|500px|South Korean standard Dubeolsik (two-set type) layout.]]

This article explains how the [[Korean language]] is input and output on [[computer]]s.

== Character encodings ==
{{See also|EUC-KR|ISO/IEC 2022|KPS 9566}}
In [[rfc:1557|RFC 1557]], a method known as [[ISO-2022-KR]] for a 7-bit encoding of Korean characters in [[email]] was described.&amp;nbsp; Where 8 bits are allowed, the [[EUC-KR]] encoding is preferred.&amp;nbsp; These two encodings combine US-ASCII ([[ISO/IEC 646|ISO 646]]) with the Korean standard [[KS X 1001]]:1992&lt;ref name="qk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://examples.oreilly.com/cjkvinfo/AppL/ksx1001.pdf |title=KS X 1001:1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; (previously named KS C 5601:1987).&amp;nbsp; In [[North Korea]], a separate character set called [[KPS 9566]] is in use, which is rather similar to KS X 1001.

The international [[Unicode]] standard contains special characters for representing the Korean language in the native [[hangul]] phonetic system.&amp;nbsp; There are two ways supported by Unicode.&amp;nbsp; The way used by [[Microsoft Windows]] is to have every one of the [[Hangul#Unicode Charts|11,172]] syllable combinations as a code and a pre-formed font character.&amp;nbsp; The other way is to encode ''[[Hangul#Jamo|jamos]]'', and to let the software combine them into correct combinations, which is not supported in Windows.&amp;nbsp; Of course the former way needs more font memory, but gives the possibility of getting better shapes, since it is complicated to create fully correct combinations which may be preferred when creating documents.

There is also the possibility of simply stacking a (sequence of) [[Hangul#Jamo|medial]](s) (''jungseong''){{snd}} and then a (sequence of) [[Hangul#Jamo|final]](s) (''jongseong'') and/or a Middle Korean pitch mark, if needed{{snd}} on top of the (sequence of) [[Hangul#Jamo|initial]](s) (''choseong''), if the font has medial and final ''jamos'' with zero-width spacing that are inserted to the left of the cursor or caret, thus appearing in the right place below or to the right of the initial.&amp;nbsp; If a syllable has a horizontal medial ({{lang|ko|ㅗ}}, {{lang|ko|ㅛ}}, {{lang|ko|ㅜ}}, {{lang|ko|ㅠ}} or {{lang|ko|ㅡ}}), the initial will probably appear further left in a complete syllable than is the case in pre-formed syllables due to the space that must be reserved for a vertical medial, giving an aesthetically poor appearance to what may be the only way to display Middle Korean hangul text without resorting to images, romanisation, replacement of obsolete jamo or non-standard encodings.&amp;nbsp; However, most current fonts do not support this.

The [[Unicode]] standard also has attempted to create a unified [[CJK]] character set that can represent Chinese ([[Hanzi]]) as well as the Japanese ([[Kanji]]) and Korean ([[Hanja]]) derivatives of this script through the [[Han unification]] process, which does not discriminate by language nor region for rendering Chinese characters, as long as the different typographic traditions have not resulted in major differences concerning what the character looks like{{snd}} see ''[[:Image:Xin-jiu-zixing.png]]'' for examples of characters whose appearance recently underwent only minor changes in Mainland China. Han unification has been met with some criticism.

== Text input ==
{{See also2|[[Windows#Multilingual support: IMEs and LIPs|Windows multilingual support]]|[[Input method editor]]|[[List of input methods for UNIX platforms|List of input methods for UNIX]]|[[Japanese input methods]]|[[Chinese input methods for computers|Chinese input methods]]}}
On a Korean computer keyboard, text is typically entered by simply pressing a key for the appropriate [[Hangul#Jamo|jamo]]; the operating system creates each composite character on the fly.  Depending on the [[Input method|IME]] and keyboard layout, double consonants can be entered by holding the shift button.  When all jamo making up a syllabic block have been entered, the user may initiate a conversion to hanja or other special characters using a keyboard shortcut or interface button; South Korean keyboards have a separate key for this.  Subsequent semi-automated hanja conversion is supported to varying degrees in word processors.

When using a keyboard from another language, most operating systems require the user to type using an original Korean keyboard layout, the most common of which is [[Keyboard layout#Dubeolsik|''2(du)-beolsik'']].  This is in contrast to some other languages, like Japanese, where text can be entered using a Romanization system on non-native keyboards.

== Hanja ==
Apart from the conversion issues mentioned above, some Korean fonts do not include hanja to start with. At the same time, current word processors do not allow the user to specify which font to use as a fallback for any hanja that may occur in a text. In that case, each sequence of hanja must be manually formatted to appear in the desired font.

== Special situations ==
Having [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|text run in vertical lines]] is supported poorly or not at all by HTML and most word processors, although this is not an issue for modern Korean, as it is usually written horizontally. Until the second half of the 20th century, however, Korean was often written vertically. 15th century texts written in hangul had pitch marks to the left of syllables, which are included in Unicode, although most current fonts&lt;!-- …or none at all? I haven’t seen any yet. --&gt; do not adequately support them, either.

See the section on [[#Character encodings|character encodings]] above for obsolete jamo.

== Programs ==
&lt;!-- please add notable SOUTH Korean programs, too --&gt;
Notable programs specifically designed for Korean language-related use include:
* Language recognition
** A North Korean [[speech recognition]] program is said to recognise 100,000 words and to achieve a success rate of more than 90%.&lt;ref name="qa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tongilnews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=2455 |script-title=ko:문답으로 보는 북한 정보화의 현주소 |author=김치관|work=Tongilnews.com |date=2000-12-02 |language=Korean |accessdate=2006-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hangul in Unicode ==
{{see also|List of Hangul jamo}}

Hangul letters are detailed in several separate parts of the Unicode specification:
* [[Hangul Syllables]] (AC00–D7A3)
* [[Hangul Jamo (Unicode block)|Hangul Jamo]] (1100–11FF)
* [[Hangul Compatibility Jamo]] (3130–318F)
* [[Hangul Jamo Extended-A]] (A960–A97F)
* [[Hangul Jamo Extended-B]] (D7B0–D7FF)

=== Hangul Syllables block ===
The precomposed hangul syllables in the Hangul Syllables block in Unicode are algorithmically defined, using the following formula:
: [(initial) × 588 + (medial) × 28 + (final)] + 44032

* Initial consonants

{{#tag:li| [[wikt:ㅌ|ㅌ]]}}
{{#tag:li| [[wikt:ㅍ|ㅍ]]}}
{{#tag:li| [[wikt:ㅎ|ㅎ]]}}
}}

For example, if one wants to find the code point of "[[wikt:한|한]]" in Unicode:

* The value of initial consonant ㅎ is 18.
* The value of medial vowel ㅏ is 0.
* The value of final consonant ㄴ is 4.

Substituting these values to the formula above, one gets [(18 × 588) + (0 × 28) + 4] + 44032 = 54620. This means that the Unicode value of 한 is 54620 in decimal, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#54620;&lt;/code&gt; by the [[numeric character reference]], and U+D55C in hexadecimal Unicode notation.

=== Hangul Compatibility Jamo block ===
'''Hangul Compatibility Jamo''' block is part of Unicode which has been allocated for compatibility with the [[KS X 1001]] character set. It is usually used for representing some hangul jamo by itself, without distinguishing ''initial'' and ''final''.

=== Hangul Jamo blocks ===
'''Hangul Jamo''', '''Hangul Jamo Extended-A''' and '''Hangul Jamo Extended-B''' blocks contain ''initial jamo'', ''medial jamo'' and ''final jamo'', including obsolete jamo.

=== Hanyang Private Use Area code ===
[[Hangul (word processor)]] ships with fonts from [[Hanyang Information and Communication]]. Their fonts map obsolete hangul characters to the [[Private Use Area]] of Unicode. Despite the use of the Private Use Area instead of dedicated codepoints, Hanyang’s mapping is currently the most popular way to represent obsolete hangul in South Korea.

Starting from Hangul 2010, [[Hancom]] deprecated Hanyang PUA code and chose to represent obsolete hangul characters using hangul jamo in Unicode.

'''Kyirong–Kagate''' is a subgroup of [[Tibetic languages]] spoken primarily in Nepal, with a hundred or so speakers across the border in Tibet.

Varieties are:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;N. Tournadre (2005) "L'aire linguistique tibétaine et ses divers dialectes." ''Lalies'', 2005, n°25, p.&amp;nbsp;7–56 [http://tournadre.nicolas.free.fr/fichiers/2005-aire.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
: [[Kyirong language|Kyirong]] (Lende), [[Kagate language|Kagate]], [[Tsum language|Tsum]], [[Langtang language|Langtang]], [[Yolmo language|Yolmo]] (Helambu Sherpa), Nubri, Gyalsumdo

Although there is a varying degree of mutual intelligibility between these varieties,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gawne|first=Lauren|date=|year=2013|title=Notes on the relationship between Yolmo and Kagate|url=http://www.digitalhimalaya.com/collections/journals/nepling/|journal=Himalayan Linguistics|volume=12 |issue=2|pages=1–27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are considered separate languages by their respective speakers. There are also some major distinctions.  For example, Kyirong has a three-tone system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Tibetan dialect of Lende (Kyirong).|last = Huber|first = Brigitte|publisher = VGH Wissenschaftsverlag|year = 2005|isbn = |location = Bonn|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Yolmo and Kagate have a two-tone system.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Yohlmo Sketch Grammar|last = Hari|first = Anne Marie|publisher = Ekta|year = 2010|isbn = |location = Kathmandu|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gyalsumdo language variety spoken in the Manage district of Nepal shows strong similarities to Kyirong, as well as Nubri, and would therefore likely be classed in the "Kyirong–Kagate" group.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5gp5q3qt|title = Preliminary notes on Gyalsumdo, an undocumented Tibetan variety in Manang District, Nepal.|last = Hildebrandt|first = Kristine Ann|date = 2011|journal = Himalayan Linguistics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Perry|first2 = J. Joseph|issue = 10|pages = 167–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminological limitation ==
The language family is best considered to really be Kyirong–Yolmo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is for a number of reasons; firstly, there are only around 1000 people who identify as Kagate, and many of these also consider themselves to be Yolmo. Secondly, Kagate is only regularly used to identify the community in Ramechhap, while Yolmo can be found in Melamchi, Helambu, Ilam, Lamjung and other places. Thirdly, the name Kagate is considered negative by many speakers, as it refers to the low-caste occupation of papermaking.

== Variation between languages ==
These varieties are all clearly historically related,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; but some are more similar than others. Kagate and Yolmo share many common features, and can be considered mutually intelligible dialects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Lamjung Yolmo: a dialect of Yolmo, also known as Helambu Sherpa|last = Gawne|first = Lauren|date = 2010|journal = Nepalese Linguistics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 25|pages = 34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nubri and Gyalsumdo also appear to be closely related, based on initial research.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although Yolmo and Kyirong are more similar to each other than they are to [[Standard Tibetan]], they are different enough to be considered different languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An investigation of the relationship between the Kyirong, Yòlmo, and Standard Spoken Tibetan speech varieties (unpublished MA thesis)|last = Hedlin|first = Matthew|publisher = Payap University, Chiang Mai, Thailand|year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In politics and government, '''lapsed power''' is a term often used to describe a certain constitutionally-granted power of government that is no longer used, according to [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]. This may be because the power's original conditions of use no longer exist, making it an [[anachronism]], or simply because the nation's political culture and attitudes have shifted, making the power appear too morally or ethically objectionable to use. However, the power still exists.

Examples of lapsed powers include the [[reserve powers]] of a monarch under a [[constitutional monarchy]]. Constitutional monarchs have significant powers over matters such as the appointment of the [[prime minister]] or the [[veto]] of legislation, but in practice these powers are rarely actually used independently.

Comparative public law scholar [[Richard Albert (law professor)|Richard Albert]] has theorized a related phenomenon he calls "constitutional desuetude," which occurs "when an entrenched constitutional provision loses its binding force upon political actors as a result of its conscious sustained nonuse and public repudiation by preceding and present political actors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2461509|title=Richard Albert, "Constitutional Amendment by Constitutional Desuetude," American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol. 62, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10758">Following is a '''list of text corpora''' in various languages. "Text corpora" is the plural of "[[text corpus]]". A text corpus is a large and structured set of texts (nowadays usually electronically stored and processed). Text corpora are used to do statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, checking occurrences or validating linguistic rules within a specific language territory.

'''Louise Weiss''' (25 January 1893 in [[Arras]], [[Pas-de-Calais]] &amp;ndash; 26 May 1983 in [[Paris]]) was a [[France|French]] author, journalist, [[feminist]] and [[European Union|European]] politician.

== Life ==
Louise Weiss came from a cosmopolitan family of [[Alsace]]. Her father, Paul Louis Weiss, a mining engineer, was a distinguished Alsatian [[Protestant]] from [[La Petite-Pierre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/weiss-louise "Louise Weiss"] on the Jewish Woman's Archive&lt;/ref&gt; The ancestors of her Jewish mother, [[Javal family|Jeanne Javal]], originated from the small Alsatian town of [[Seppois-le-Bas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://judaisme.sdv.fr/perso/lweiss/lweiss.htm "Louise Weiss"] on judaisme.sdv.fr&lt;/ref&gt;  She grew up in Paris with five siblings, was trained as a teacher against the will of her family, was a teacher at a secondary school for arts and awarded a degree from [[Oxford University]]. From 1914 to 1918, she worked as a war nurse and founded a hospital in the [[Côtes-du-Nord]]. From 1918 to 1934, she was the publisher of the magazine, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|L'Europe nouvelle|fr}}''. From 1935 to the beginning of [[World War II]], she committed herself to [[women's suffrage]]. In 1936, she stood for [[French legislative election, 1936|French parliamentary elections]], running in the [[Fifth arrondissement of Paris]]. During the War, she was active in the [[French Resistance]]. She was a member of the ''Patriam Recuperare'' network, and she was [[chief editor]] of the secret magazine, "Nouvelle République" from 1942 until 1944. In 1945, she founded the Institute for [[Polemology]] (research on war and conflict) together with {{Interlanguage link multi|Gaston Bouthoul|fr}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.wikimediation.org/index.php?title=Polemology | title=Polemology | work=WikiMediation | accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[London]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} She travelled around the [[Middle East]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Africa]], [[Kenya]], [[Madagascar]], [[Alaska]], [[India]], etc., made documentary films and wrote accounts of her travels. In 1975, she unsuccessfully tried twice to be admitted to the [[Académie Française]]. In 1979, she became a [[Member of the European Parliament]] for the Gaullist Party (now [[Union for a Popular Movement]]).

== Journalist ==

During [[World War I]], she published her first press reports under a [[pseudonym]]. In Paris, she came in contact with her first great loves, representatives of countries striving for independence, such as [[Eduard Beneš]], [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk|Tomáš Masaryk]] and [[Milan Rastislav Štefánik|Milan Štefánik]]. Between 1919 and 1939, she often travelled to [[Czechoslovakia]]. In 1918, she founded the weekly newspaper, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Europe nouvelle|fr|3=L'Europe nouvelle}}'' (New Europe), which she published until 1934. [[Thomas Mann]], [[Gustav Stresemann]], [[Rudolf Breitscheid]] and [[Aristide Briand]] were among her co-authors on the paper. Louise Weiss described those who paved the way for the closening of the [[German-French relationship]] between the World Wars as "peace pilgrims", and they called their important co-worker "my good Louise". Europe dreamed of unification and in 1930, she founded the "Ecole de la Paix" (School of Peace), a private institute for international relations. With the takeover by the [[National Socialism|National Socialists]] in [[Germany]], the possibility of a unification was over.

==Politician==
In 1979, Louise Weiss stood as a candidate of the [[Gaullist Party]] in the [[European Parliament election, 1979 (France)|first European election]] in 1979. On 17 July 1979 she was elected as a French [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP), sitting with the [[European People's Party]]. At the time of the first election, aged 86, she was the oldest member in Parliament and thus the EP's first [[President of the European Parliament#Election|'oldest member']]. She remained MEP and oldest member until her death on 26 May 1983, aged 90.

The main parliament building in Strasbourg bears her name.

== Women's Rights Activist ==
In 1934, she founded the association, ''[[La femme nouvelle]]'' (The New Woman) with [[Cécile Brunsvicg]], and she strove for a stronger role of women in public life. She participated in campaigns for the [[Women's suffrage|right of women to vote]] in France, organised suffragette commands, demonstrated and had herself chained to a street light in Paris with other women. In 1935, she unsuccessfully sued against the "inability of women to vote" before the French [[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]].

'''Maku''' or '''Mako''' (Spanish ''Macú'', Portuguese ''Máku'') is an [[unclassified language]] spoken on the [[Brazil]]–[[Venezuela]] border in [[Roraima]] along the upper [[Uraricoera River|Uraricoera]] and lower [[Auari River|Auari]] rivers, west of [[Boa Vista, Roraima|Boa Vista]]. 300 years ago, the Macu territory had been between the [[Padamo River|Padamo]] and [[Cunucunuma River|Cunucunuma]] rivers to the southeast.

The last speaker died between 2000 and 2002. Aryon Rodrigues and Ernesto Migliazza have worked on the language, and there is enough material for a grammar, though as of 2010 this had not been published.

==Name==
No proper name for the language is recorded.  ''Macu'' is not a proper name, but rather an Arawakan term for unintelligible languages and people held in servitude in the Orinoco region. (See [[Maku people (disambiguation)|Maku people]] for a partial list.) The stress is typically given on the final syllable, '''Makú''' (Migliazza, Fabré). However, in order to distinguish the language of the Auari from the many other languages given this name, the stress is sometimes shifted to the first syllable: '''''Máku''''' (Maciel, Dixon &amp; Aikhenvald) or '''''Máko''''' (Campbell &amp; Grondona). The disambiguator '''''Maku-Auari''''' is used by Hammerström.&lt;ref&gt;"A note on the Maco [wpc] (Piaroan) language of the lower Ventuari, Venezuela". ''Cadernos de Etnolingüística'' volume 3, número 1, February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==

Roraima Macu has six oral vowels, {{IPA|/i y ɨ u e a/}}, and four nasal vowels, {{IPA|/ĩ ũ ẽ ã/}}. Length is contrastive, but only on an initial CV syllable of a polysyllabic word. The most complex syllable is CCVC. There is no contrastive stress or tone.

Consonants are stops {{IPA|/p b t d k ʔ/}}, the affricate {{IPA|/ts/}}, fricatives {{IPA|/s ʃ x h/}}, nasals {{IPA|/m n/}}, the lateral "r" (perhaps {{IPA|/ɺ/}}?), and the approximants {{IPA|/w j/}}.

There is a lateral consonant "r," probably the alveolar flap /ɺ/.

==Grammar==
Macu is highly [[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] and predominantly suffixing. There is [[clusivity]] but no genders or classifiers. The [[Tense–aspect–mood|TAM]] system is very complex.

==Genetic relations==

Suggested genetic relations involving Macu include

* with [[Arawakan]]
* with [[Warao people|Warao]]
* within a [[Kalianan]] grouping with [[Arutani–Sape languages|Arutani–Sape]] (a.k.a. Makú)
* within a [[Macro-Puinavean]] grouping with [[Nadahup languages|Nadahup]] (a.k.a. Makú), [[Katukinan languages|Katukinan]], &amp; [[Arutani–Sape]]

Kaufman (1990) finds the Kalianan proposal "promising", though he is now dated.

The '''grammar of [[Modern Greek]]''', as spoken in present-day [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]], is essentially that of [[Demotic Greek]], but it has also assimilated certain elements of [[Katharevousa]], the archaic, learned variety of Greek imitating [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]] forms, which used to be the official language of Greece through much of the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Horrocks, ''Greek: A History of the Language and its Speakers'', Longman, New York, 1997, {{ISBN|0582307090}}, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tanea"&gt;{{el icon}} Γεώργιος Μπαμπινιώτης (5 December 1999). [http://www.tovima.gr/opinions/article/?aid=116984 "Τι γλώσσα μιλάμε"]. ''[[Ta Nea|Τα Νέα]]''. Retrieved 6 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Greek grammar has preserved many features of [[Ancient Greek grammar|Ancient Greek]], but has also undergone changes in a similar direction as many other modern [[Indo-European languages]], from more [[synthetic language|synthetic]] to more [[analytic language|analytic]] structures.

==General characteristics==

===Syntax===
The predominant word order in Greek is [[subject–verb–object|SVO]] (subject–verb–object), but word order is quite freely variable, with [[verb–subject–object|VSO]] and other orders as frequent alternatives.&lt;ref name="HPW.C.5.2"&gt;{{harvnb|Holton|Mackridge|Philippaki-Warburton|1997|loc=§C.5.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[noun phrase]], adjectives precede the noun (for example, {{lang|el|το μεγάλο σπίτι}}, {{IPA|[to meˈɣalo ˈspiti]}}, 'the big house'), while possessors follow it (for example, {{lang|el|το σπίτι μου}}, {{IPA|[to ˈspiti mu]}}, 'my house'; {{lang|el|το σπίτι του Νίκου}} 'Nick's house').&lt;ref name="HPW.C.2.4.3.2"&gt;{{harvnb|Holton|Mackridge|Philippaki-Warburton|1997|loc=§C.2.4.3.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative constructions involving the opposite order of constituents are possible as a marked option (e.g. {{lang|el|το σπίτι το μεγάλο}} 'the big house'; {{lang|el|του Νίκου το σπίτι}} 'Nick's house')&lt;ref name="HPW.C.2.11"&gt;{{harvnb|Holton|Mackridge|Philippaki-Warburton|1997|loc=§C.2.11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek is a [[pro-drop language]], i.e. [[subject (grammar)|subject]]s are typically not overtly expressed whenever they are inferable from context.&lt;ref name="Joseph1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Joseph|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the word order of the major elements within the clause is fairly free, certain grammatical elements attach to the verb as [[clitic]]s and form a rigidly ordered group together with it. This applies particularly to unstressed object pronouns, negation [[Grammatical particle|particle]]s, the tense particle {{lang|el|θα}} {{IPA|[θa]}}, and the [[subjunctive]] particle {{lang|el|να}} {{IPA|[na]}}. Likewise, possessive pronouns are enclitic to the nouns they modify.

===Morphology===
Greek is a largely [[Synthetic language|synthetic]] (inflectional) language. Although the complexity of the inflectional system has been somewhat reduced in comparison to [[Ancient Greek]], there is also a considerable degree of continuity in the morphological system, and Greek still has a somewhat archaic character compared with other Indo-European languages of Europe.&lt;ref name="Browning"&gt;Robert Browning, ''Medieval and Modern Greek'', Cambridge University Press, Second Edition, 1983, {{ISBN|0521299780}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nouns, adjectives and verbs are each divided into several inflectional classes (declension classes and conjugation classes), which have different sets of endings. In the nominals, the ancient inflectional system is well preserved, with the exception of the loss of one case, the [[dative]], and the restructuring of several of the inflectional classes. In the verbal system, the loss of synthetic inflectional categories is somewhat greater, and several new [[Analytic language|analytic]] (periphrastic) constructions have evolved instead.

===Characteristics of the Balkan language area===
Modern Greek shares several syntactic characteristics with its geographical neighbours, with which it forms the so-called [[Balkan language area]] (''Sprachbund'').&lt;ref name="Lindstedt"&gt;{{harvnb|Lindstedt|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these characteristics are:
*The lack of an infinitive. In Greek, verbal complementation in contexts where English would use an infinitive is typically formed with the help of finite (subjunctive) verb forms (e.g. {{lang|el|θέλω να πάω}}, {{IPA|[ˈθelo na ˈpao]}}, literally 'I-want that I-go', i.e. 'I want to go').
*The merger of the dative and the genitive case. In Greek, indirect objects are expressed partly through genitive forms of nouns or pronouns, and partly through a periphrasis consisting of the preposition {{lang|el|σε}} ({{IPA|[se]}}, 'to') and the accusative.
*The use of a future construction derived from the verb 'want' ({{lang|el|θέλει να}} {{IPA|[ˈθeli na]}} → {{lang|el|θα}} {{IPA|[θa]}}).
*A tendency to use pre-verbal clitic object pronouns redundantly ([[clitic doubling]]), doubling an object that is also expressed elsewhere in the clause: for example, {{lang|el|το είδα το αυτοκίνητο}} ({{IPA|[to ˈiða to aftoˈcinito]}}, 'I saw it, the car", literally 'It I-saw the car').
On the other hand, one prominent feature of the Balkan language area that Greek does not share is the use of a postposed definite article. The Greek article (like the Ancient Greek one) stands before the noun.

==Accent==
Modern Greek has a [[stress accent]], similar to English. The accent is notated with a stroke (΄) over the accented vowel and is called {{lang|el|οξεία}} (''oxeia'', "acute") or {{lang|el|τόνος}} (''tonos'', "accent") in Greek. The former term is taken from one of the accents used in [[polytonic orthography]] which officially became obsolete in 1982.

Most monosyllabic words take no accent such as in {{lang|el|το}} ({{IPA|[to]}}, "the") and {{lang|el|ποιος}} ({{IPA|[pços]}}, "who"). Exceptions include the conjunction {{lang|el|ή}} ({{IPA|[i]}}, "or"), the interrogative adverbs {{lang|el|πώς}} ({{IPA|[pos]}}, "how") and {{lang|el|πού}} ({{IPA|[pu]}}, "where") in both direct and indirect questions and some fixed expressions such as {{lang|el|πού και πού}} ({{IPA|[pu ce pu]}}, "occasionally") and {{lang|el|πώς και πώς}} ({{IPA|[pos ce pos]}}, "cravingly"). Moreover, weak personal pronouns are accented in cases where they may be mistaken for enclitics (see below). For example, {{lang|el|ο σκύλος μού γάβγισε}} ({{IPA|[o ˈscilos mu ˈɣavʝise]}}, "the dog barked at me") instead of {{lang|el|ο σκύλος μου γάβγισε}} ({{IPA|[o ˈsciloz‿mu ˈɣavʝise]}}, "my dog barked").&lt;ref name="triantafyllidis"&gt;Καρανικόλας, Α. κά., ''Νεοελληνική Γραμματική: Αναπροσαρμογή της μικρής νεοελληνικής γραμματικής του Μανόλη Τριανταφυλλίδη'', Οργανισμός Εκδόσεως Διδακτικών Βιβλίων, Αθήνα, 2004, pp. 22–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Enclitics are pronounced very closely to the previous word. Most enclitics are weak personal pronouns. Enclitics do not modify the accent of the previous word when this word is accented on the ultimate or penultimate syllable, for example {{lang|el|οδηγός μας}} ({{IPA|[oðiˈɣoz‿mas]}}, "our driver") and {{lang|el|βιβλίο σου}} ({{IPA|[viˈvlio‿su]}}, "your book"). However, when the previous word is accented on the antepenultimate syllable, the enclitic causes the ultimate syllable to be accented too. For example, {{lang|el|δάσκαλος}} ({{IPA|[ˈðaskalos]}}, "teacher") but {{lang|el|δάσκαλός μου}} ({{IPA|[ˌðaskaˈloz‿mu]}}, "my teacher") and {{lang|el|φόρεσε}} ({{IPA|[ˈforese]}}, "wear {{sc|(imp)}}") but {{lang|el|φόρεσέ το}} ({{IPA|[ˌforeˈse‿to]}}, "wear it"). Finally, enclitics are accented only when they precede another enclitic and these two determine an imperative accented on the penultimate syllable. For example, {{lang|el|φέρε μού το}} ({{IPA|[ˌfere‿ˈmu‿to]}}, "bring it to me").&lt;ref name="triantafyllidis"/&gt;

In [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] which are pronounced as simple [[phoneme]]s such as {{lang|el|αι}} {{IPA|[e]}}, {{lang|el|οι}} {{IPA|[i]}} and {{lang|el|ει}} {{IPA|[i]}} and in the case of {{lang|el|αυ}} ({{IPA|[af]}} or {{IPA|[av]}}) and {{lang|el|ευ}} ({{IPA|[ef]}} or {{IPA|[ev]}}), the accent is written on the second letter as in {{lang|el|αί}}, {{lang|el|εί}}, {{lang|el|αύ}} etc. When the accent is written on the first letter, the sequence is pronounced as an accented diphthong, for example {{lang|el|άι}} {{IPA|[ˈai̯]}} as in {{lang|el|γάιδαρος}} ({{IPA|[ˈɣai̯ðaros]}}, "donkey"). When the second letter takes a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]], the sequence is often pronounced as a diphthong, for example {{lang|el|αϊ}} {{IPA|[ai̯]}} as in {{lang|el|παϊδάκια}} ({{IPA|[pai̯ˈðaca]}}, "ribs"). Finally, when the accent is placed on the second letter together with diaeresis, the vowels are pronounced separately and the second vowel is accented, for example {{lang|el|αΐ}} {{IPA|[aˈi]}} as in {{lang|el|σαΐτα}} ({{IPA|[saˈita]}}, "paper airplane").

As in Ancient Greek, in Modern Greek the accent cannot be placed before the antepenultimate syllable (Greek: {{lang|el|νόμος της τρισυλλαβίας}}, law of limitation, historically called ''[[Dreimorengesetz]]''). As a result, in many [[wikt:imparisyllabic|imparisyllabic]] nouns, i.e. nouns that do not have the same number of syllables in all their inflections, an antepenultimate accent moves to the next syllable when a syllable is added. For example, {{sc|nom}} {{sc|sg}} {{lang|el|μάθημα}} ({{IPA|[ˈmaθima]}}, "lesson") but {{sc|gen}} {{sc|sg}} {{lang|el|μαθήματος}} {{IPA|[maˈθimatos]}} and {{sc|nom}} {{sc|pl}} {{lang|el|μαθήματα}} {{IPA|[maˈθimata]}} etc. In some words, the accent moves forward even without the addition of a syllable. For example, {{sc|nom}} {{sc|sg}} {{lang|el|άνθρωπος}} ({{IPA|[ˈanθropos]}}, "human") but {{sc|gen}} {{sc|sg}} {{lang|el|ανθρώπου}} {{IPA|[anˈθropu]}}, {{sc|gen}} {{sc|pl}} {{lang|el|ανθρώπων}} {{IPA|[anˈθropon]}} and {{sc|acc}} {{sc|pl}} {{lang|el|ανθρώπους}} {{IPA|[anˈθropus]}}. This is due to historical reasons: long vowels and diphthongs occupied two [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] which had the same effect as the addition of a syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{el icon}} [http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/modern_greek/tools/lexica/glossology/show.html?id=21 Portal for the Greek Language: νόμος της τρισυλλαβίας]. Retrieved 6 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verbs==
Greek verb morphology is structured around a basic 2-by-2 contrast of two [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]], namely [[imperfective]] and [[perfective]], and two [[Grammatical tense|tenses]], namely past and non-past (or present). The aspects are expressed by two separate verb stems, while the tenses are marked mainly by different sets of endings. Of the four possible combinations, only three can be used in [[indicative]] function: the '''present''' (i.e. imperfective non-past), the  '''imperfect''' (i.e. imperfective past) and the '''aorist''' (i.e. perfective past). All four combinations can be used in [[subjunctive]] function, where they are typically preceded by the particle {{lang|el|να}} or by one of a set of subordinating conjunctions. There are also two [[Imperative mood|imperatives]], one for each aspect.

In addition to these basic forms, Greek also has several [[periphrastic]] verb constructions. All the basic forms can be combined with the [[Future tense|future]] particle {{lang|el|θα}} (historically a contraction of {{lang|el|θέλει να}}, 'want to'). Combined with the non-past forms, this creates an imperfective and a perfective future. Combined with the imperfective past it is used as a [[Conditional mood|conditional]], and with the perfective past as an [[Inferential mood|inferential]]. There is also a [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], which is expressed with an inflected form of the [[auxiliary verb]] {{lang|el|έχω}} ('have'). It occurs both as a past perfect (pluperfect) and as a present perfect.

Modern Greek verbs additionally have three [[Non-finite verb|non-finite]] forms. There is a form traditionally called "απαρέμφατο" (i.e. 'infinitive', literally the 'invariant form'), which is historically derived from the perfective (aorist) infinitive, but has today lost all syntactical functions typically associated with that category. It is used only to form the periphrastic perfect and pluperfect, and is always formally identical to the 3rd person singular of the perfective non-past. There is also a passive participle, typically ending in ''-menos (-meni, -meno)'', which is inflected as a regular adjective. Its use is either as a canonical adjective, or as a part of a second, alternative perfect periphrasis with transitive verbs. Finally, there is another invariant form, formed from the present tense and typically ending in ''-ontas'', which is variably called either a participle or a gerund by modern authors. It is historically derived from an old present participle, and its sole use today is to form non-finite adjunct adverbial clauses of time or manner, roughly corresponding to an ''-ing'' participle in English.

* Regular perfect periphrasis, with ''aparemphato'' ("invariant form"), for example:
** {{lang|el|Έχω γράψει την επιταγή}} ({{IPA|[ˈexo ˈɣrapsi tin epitaˈʝi]}}, 'I have written the cheque')
* Alternative perfect periphrasis, with passive participle, for example:
** {{lang|el|Έχω την επιταγή γραμμένη}} ({{IPA|[ˈexo tin epitaˈʝi ɣraˈmeni]}}, 'I have written the cheque')
* Adverbial clause with present participle/gerund form, for example:
** {{lang|el|Έτρεξε στο δρόμο τραγουδώντας}} ({{IPA|[ˈetrekse sto ˈðromo traɣuˈðondas]}}, 'he ran along the street singing')

The tables below exemplify the range of forms with those of one large inflectional class of verbs, the 1st Conjugation.

===Augment===
The use of the past tense prefix {{lang|el|ε-}} (''e-''), the so-called [[Augment (linguistics)|augment]], shows some variation and irregularity between verb classes. In regular (demotic) verbs in standard modern Greek, the prefix is used depending on a stress rule, which specifies that each past tense verb form has its stress on the third syllable from the last (the ''antepenultimate''); the prefix is only inserted whenever the verb would otherwise have fewer than three syllables. In these verbs, the augment always appears as {{lang|el|έ-}}. A number of frequent verbs have irregular forms involving other vowels, mostly {{lang|el|η-}} (''i-''), for example, {{lang|el|θέλω}} → {{lang|el|ήθελα}} ('want'). In addition, verbs from the learned tradition partly preserve more complex patterns inherited from ancient Greek. In learned compound verbs with adverbial prefixes such as {{lang|el|περι-}} (''peri-'') or {{lang|el|υπο-}} (''ipo-''), the augment is inserted between the prefix and the verb stem (for example, {{lang|el|περι-γράφω}} → {{lang|el|περι-έ-γραψα}} ('describe'). Where the prefix itself ends in a vowel, the vowels in this position may be subject to further assimilation rules, such as in {{lang|el|υπο-γράφω}} → {{lang|el|υπ-έ-γραψα}} ('sign'). In addition, verbs whose stem begins in a vowel may also display vocalic changes instead of a syllabic augment, as in {{lang|el|ελπίζω}} → {{lang|el|ήλπιζα}} ('hope'). The table below presents some further examples of these patterns:

===Grammatical voice===
Greek is one of the few modern Indo-European languages that still retains a morphological contrast between the two inherited Proto-Indo-European [[grammatical voice]]s: [[Active voice|active]] and [[Mediopassive voice|mediopassive]]. The mediopassive has several functions: 
*Passive function, denoting an action that is performed on the subject by another agent (for example, {{lang|el|σκοτώθηκε}} 'he was killed');
*Reflexive function, denoting an action performed by the subject on him-/herself (for example, {{lang|el|ξυρίστηκε}} 'he shaved himself');
*Reciprocal function, denoting an action performed by several subjects on each other (for example, {{lang|el|αγαπιούνται}} 'they love each other');
*Modal function, denoting the possibility of an action (for example, {{lang|el|τρώγεται}} 'it is edible');
*Deponential function: verbs that occur only in the mediopassive and lack a corresponding active form. They often have meanings that are rendered as active in other languages: {{lang|el|εργάζομαι}} 'Ι work'; {{lang|el|κοιμάμαι}} 'I sleep'; {{lang|el|δέχομαι}} 'I accept'. There are also many verbs that have both an active and a mediopassive form but where the mediopassive has a special function that may be rendered with a separate verb in other languages: for example, active {{lang|el|σηκώνω}} 'I raise', passive {{lang|el|σηκώνομαι}} 'I get up'; active {{lang|el|βαράω}} 'I strike', passive {{lang|el|βαριέμαι}} 'I am bored'.

*There are also more formal suffixes instead of '''-μασταν''', '''-σασταν''': '''-μαστε''', '''-σαστε'''. In this case the suffixes of the first person of the plural of present and imperfect are the same.

===''Be'' and ''have''===
The verbs {{lang|el|είμαι}} ('be') and {{lang|el|έχω}} ('have') are irregular and [[defective verb|defective]], because they both lack the aspectual contrast. The forms of both are given below.
The first and second person plural forms ήμαστε and ήσαστε appear very rarely in the spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;Χατζησαββίδου Αθανασία,Χατζησαββίδης Σωφρόνης , ''Γραμματική Νέας Ελληνικής Γλώσσας'',Υπουργείο Παιδείας, Έρευνας και Θρησκευμάτων/ΙΤΥΕ-Διόφαντος, 1997, {{ISBN|9789600626940}}, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nouns==
The Greek nominal system displays inflection for two numbers (singular and plural), three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter), and four cases (nominative, genitive, accusative and [[vocative case|vocative]]). As in many other Indo-European languages, the distribution of grammatical gender across nouns is largely arbitrary and need not coincide with natural sex.&lt;ref name="HPWC.2.2"&gt;{{harvnb|Holton|Mackridge|Philippaki-Warburton|1997|loc=§C.2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Case, number and gender are marked on the noun as well as on articles and adjectives modifying it. While there are four cases, there is a great degree of [[syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]] between case forms within most paradigms. Only one sub-group of the masculine nouns actually has four distinct forms in the four cases.

===Articles===
There are two articles in Modern Greek, the definite and the indefinite. They are both inflected for gender and case, and the definite article also for number. The article agrees with the noun it modifies.

====Definite article====
The definite article is used frequently in Greek, such as before proper names and nouns used in an abstract sense. For example,
*'''Ο''' Αλέξανδρος ήρθε χθες ('''''O''' Alexandros irthe chthes'', "Alexander came yesterday")
*'''Η''' ειλικρίνεια είναι η καλύτερη πρακτική. ('''''I''' eilikrineia einai i kalyteri praktiki'', "Honesty is the best policy")

====Indefinite article====
The indefinite article is identical with the numeral one and has only singular. The use of the indefinite article is not dictated by rules and the speaker can use it according to the circumstances of their speech.&lt;ref&gt;Χρ. Κλαίρης, Γ. Μπαμπινιώτης, ''Γραμματική της Νέας Ελληνικής: Δομολειτουργική–Επικοινωνιακή'', Ελληνικά Γράμματα, Αθήνα, 2004, {{ISBN|9604068121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indefiniteness in plural nouns is expressed by the bare noun without an article. For example,
*Αγόρασα '''έναν''' υπολογιστή (''Agorasa '''enan''' ypologisti'', "I bought '''a''' computer")

However, the indefinite article is not used in Greek as often as in English because it specifically expresses the concept of "one". For example,
*Είναι δικηγόρος (''Einai dikigoros'', "He is a lawyer")
*Τι καλό παιδί! (''Ti kalo paidi'', "What a good boy!")

===Declensions===
Greek nouns are inflected by case and number. In addition each noun belongs to one of three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. Within each of the three genders, there are several sub-groups (declension classes) with different sets of inflectional endings.

====Masculine nouns====
The main groups of masculine nouns have the nominative singular end in -ος [-os], -ης [-is], -ας [-as], -εας [-ˈeas]. Nouns in ''-os'' are identical to the Ancient Greek [[Ancient Greek nouns#Second declension|second declension]], except for the final ''-n'' of the accusative singular. However, in other parts of speech that follow the same declension and where clarity is necessary, such as in pronouns, the ''-n'' is added. When the word has more than two syllables and the antepenult is accented, the accent fluctuates between the antepenult and the penult according to whether the last syllable has one of the ancient long diphthongs, -ου, -ων or -ους. Nouns in ''-is'' correspond to the ancient [[Ancient Greek nouns#First declension|first declension]] and have the accent on the ultimate syllable in genitive plural, and so do some nouns ending in -ίας [-ˈias].&lt;ref name="Atkinson"&gt;B.F.C. Atkinson, ''The Greek Language'', Cambridge University Press, Second Edition, October 1933, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;  Nouns in ''-as'' stem from the ancient third declension. They formed their nominative singular from the accusative singular and retain the original accent in genitive plural.&lt;ref name="Atkinson" /&gt; Nouns in ''-eas'' stem from the ancient [[Ancient Greek nouns#Third declension|third declension]] and form their plural respectively.

Moreover, there are other categories and forms too that have to do with either Demotic or Katharevousa. For example, through Demotic, many nouns, especially oxytones (those that are accented on the last syllable) in -άς (''-as'') or -ής (''-is'') form their plural by adding the stem extension -άδ- (''-ad-'') and -ήδ- (''-id-'') respectively. Although this declension group is an element of Demotic, it has its roots in [[Ionic Greek]] that influenced later [[Koine Greek|Koine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{el icon}} [http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/studies/history/thema_14/25.html §§ α &amp; β, Χαραλαμπάκης, Χ. (1997; 1999), ''Θέματα ιστορίας της ελληνικής γλώσσας: Δημιουργία της ελληνιστικής κοινής'', edited by Νίκος Παντελίδης, 2007, Πύλη για την Ελληνική γλώσσα] Retrieved May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, from Katharevousa, nouns such as μυς (''mys'', "muscle") follow the ancient declension in all cases except for the dative.

====Feminine nouns====
Most feminine nouns end in -η [-i], -α [-a] and -ος [-os]. Those that end in ''-i'' and many that end in ''-a'' stem from the ancient first declension and have the accent on the ultimate syllable in genitive plural. The rest of those that end in ''-a'' originate from the ancient third declension and have formed their nominative singular from the ancient accusative singular; those nouns keep the accent unchanged in genitive plural. The nouns that end in -ος (''-os'') are identical to the respective masculine nouns. Finally, many feminine nouns that end in -η (''-i'') correspond to Ancient Greek nouns in -ις (''-is''), which are still used as learned forms in formal contexts. Their singular forms have been adapted to the rest of the feminine nouns, while their plural forms have retained the ancient pattern in -εις (''-eis''). The forms of the genitive singular -εως (''-eos'') are also found as a stylistic variant and they are fully acceptable, and in fact are more commonly used than the old-style nominative singular form.&lt;ref name="routledgecomp"&gt;{{cite book|author1-first=David|author1-last=Holton|author2-first=Peter|author2-last=Mackridge|author3-first=Irene|author3-last=Philippaki-Warburton|title=Greek: a Comprehensive Grammar of the Modern Language|publisher=Routledge|publication-place=London; New York|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}}

====Neuter nouns====
Most neuter nouns end either in -ο [-o] (plural: -α [-a]) or -ι [-i] (plural: -ιά [-ia]). Indeed, most of them that end in ''-i'' initially ended in ''-io'', an ending for diminutives that many nouns acquired already since [[Koine Greek]]. As a result, the endings of the plural and of the genitive singular are reminiscent of those older forms. For example, the diminutive of the ancient Greek word παῖς (''pais'', "child") is παιδίον (''paidion'') and hence the modern noun παιδί (''paidi'').&lt;ref&gt;{{el icon}} [http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/studies/history/thema_14/60.html Παπαναστασίου, Γ. (2001), ''Θέματα ιστορίας της ελληνικής γλώσσας: Δημιουργία της ελληνιστικής κοινής'', edited by Νίκος Παντελίδης, 2007, Πύλη για την Ελληνική γλώσσα] Retrieved May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Other neuter nouns end in -α (''-a'') and -ος (''-os'') and their declension is similar to the ancient one. Moreover, some nouns in -ιμο (''-imo''), which are usually derivatives of verbs, are declined similarly to those that end in ''-a''. Also note that most borrowings are indeclinable neuter, and can have just about any ending, such as γουίντ-σέρφινγκ "windsurfing". Finally, all neuter nouns have identical forms across the nominative, accusative and vocative.

For other neuter nouns, the ancient declension is used. For example, το φως (''fos'', "light") becomes του φωτός, τα φώτα and των φώτων and το οξύ (''oxy'', "acid") becomes του οξέος, τα οξέα and των οξέων.

==Adjectives==
Adjectives agree with nouns in gender, case and number. Therefore, each adjective has a threefold declension paradigm for the three genders. Adjectives show agreement both when they are used as attributes, e.g. η όμορφη γυναίκα (''i omorfi gynaika'', "the beautiful woman") and when they are used as predicates e.g. η γυναίκα είναι όμορφη (''i gynaika einai omorfi'', "the woman is beautiful").

Most adjectives take forms in -ος (''-os'') in the masculine, -ο (''-o'') in the neuter and either -η (''-i''), -α (''-a'') or -ια (''-ia'') in the feminine. All those adjectives are declined similarly with the nouns that have the same endings. However they keep the accent stable where nouns change it. Adjectives with a consonant before the ending usually form the feminine with -η, those with a vowel before the ending in -α and some adjectives that end in -κός ([-ˈkos], ''-kos'') or -χός ([-ˈxos], ''-chos'') usually form it in -ια although the ending -η is applicable for those too.

Other classes of adjectives include those that take forms in -ης (''-is'') in both masculine and feminine and in -ες (''-es'') in neuter. They are declined similarly with the ancient declension. Those that are not accented on the ultima usually raise the accent in the neuter. Another group includes adjectives that end in -υς ([-is], ''-ys''). Although some are declined somewhat archaically such as οξύς (''oxys'', "acute"), most of them are declined according to the rules of Demotic Greek and in many cases and persons they acquire other endings, such as in the case of πλατύς (''platys'', "wide").

===Comparative and superlative===

Adjectives in Modern Greek can form a comparative for expressing comparisons. Similar to English, it can be formed in two ways, as a periphrastic form (as in English {{sc|pos}} beautiful, {{sc|comp}} more beautiful) and as a synthetic form using suffixes, as in English {{sc|adj}} tall {{sc|comp}} tall-er. The periphrastic comparative is formed by the particle πιο ([pço], ''pio'', originally "more") preceding the adjective. The synthetic forms of the regular adjectives in -ος, -η and -o is created with the suffix -οτερος (''-oteros''), -οτερη (''-oteri'') and -οτερο (''-otero''). For those adjectives that end in -ης and -ες or -υς, -εια and -υ the corresponding suffixes are -εστερος (''-esteros'') etc. and -υτερος (''-yteros'') etc. respectively.

A [[superlative]] is expressed by combining the comparative, in either its periphrastic or synthetic form, with a preceding definite article. Thus, Modern Greek does not distinguish between ''the largest house'' and ''the larger house''; both are το μεγαλύτερο σπίτι.

Besides the superlative proper, sometimes called "relative superlative", there is also an "absolute superlative" or [[elative (gradation)|elative]], expressing the meaning "very...", for example ωραιότατος means ''very beautiful''. Elatives are formed with the suffixes -οτατος, -οτατη and -οτατο for the regular adjectives, -εστατος etc. for those in -ης and -υτατος for those in -υς.

==Pronouns==
Greek pronouns include [[personal pronoun]]s, [[reflexive pronoun]]s, [[demonstrative pronoun]]s, [[interrogative pronouns]], [[possessive pronoun]]s, [[intensive pronoun]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Holton, Mackridge &amp; Philippaki-Warburton 2004, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; [[relative pronoun]]s, and [[indefinite pronoun]]s.

===Personal pronouns===
There are strong personal pronouns (stressed, free) and weak personal pronouns (unstressed, clitic). Nominative pronouns only have the strong form (except in some minor environments) and are used as subjects only when special emphasis is intended, since unstressed subjects recoverable from context are not overtly expressed anyway. Genitive (possessive) pronouns are used in their weak forms as pre-verbal clitics to express indirect objects (for example, του μίλησα, {{IPA|[tu ˈmilisa]}}, 'I talked to him'), and as a post-nominal clitic to express possession (for example, οι φίλοι του, {{IPA|[i ˈfili tu]}}, 'his friends'). The strong genitive forms are relatively rare and used only for special emphasis (for example, αυτού οι φίλοι, {{IPA|[afˈtu i ˈfili]}}, '''his'' friends'); often they are doubled by the weak forms (for example, αυτού του μίλησα, {{IPA|[afˈtu tu ˈmilisa]}}, ' ''him'' I talked to'). An alternative way of giving emphasis to a possessive pronoun is propping it up with the stressed adjective δικός ({{IPA|[ðiˈkos]}}, 'own'), for example, οι δικοί του φίλοι ({{IPA|[i ðiˈci tu ˈfili]}}, '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''his'' friends').

Accusative pronouns exist both in a weak and a strong form. The weak form in the oblique cases is used as a pre-verbal clitic (for example, τον είδα, {{IPA|[ton ˈiða]}}, 'I saw him'); the strong form is used elsewhere in the clause (for example, είδα αυτόν, {{IPA|[ˈiða afˈton]}}, 'I saw ''him''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'). The weak form in the nominative is found only in few idiomatic deictic expressions, such as να τος 'there he [is]', πού 'ν' τος; 'where is he?'. Third-person pronouns have separate forms for the three genders; those of the first and second person do not. The weak third-person forms are similar to the corresponding forms of the definite article. The strong third-person forms function simultaneously as generic demonstratives ('this, that').

The strong forms of the third person in the genitive (αυτού, αυτής, αυτών, αυτούς) have optional alternative forms extended by an additional syllable {{IPA|[-on-]}} or {{IPA|[-un-]}} (αυτουνού, αυτηνής, αυτωνών). In the plural, there exists the alternative accusative form αυτουνούς.

Besides αυτός {{IPA|[afˈtos]}} as a generic demonstrative, there are also the more specific spatial demonstrative pronouns τούτος, -η, -ο ({{IPA|[ˈtutos]}}, 'this here') and εκείνος, -η, -ο ({{IPA|[eˈcinos]}}, 'that there').

==Prepositions==
In [[Demotic Greek]], prepositions normally require the [[accusative case]]: από (from), για (for), με (with), μετά (after), χωρίς (without), ως (as) and σε (to, in or at). The preposition σε, when followed by a definite article, fuses with it into forms like στο (σε + το) and στη (σε + τη). While there is only a relatively small number of simple prepositions native to Demotic, the two most basic prepositions σε and από can enter into a large number of combinations with preceding adverbs to form new compound prepositions, for example, πάνω σε (on), κάτω από (underneath), πλάι σε (beside) etc.

A few prepositions that take cases other than the accusative have been borrowed into [[Standard Modern Greek]] from the learned tradition of [[Katharevousa]]: κατά (against), υπέρ (in favor of, for), αντί (instead of). Other prepositions live on in a fossilised form in certain fixed expressions (for example, εν τω μεταξύ 'in the meantime', dative).

The preposition από (''apó'', 'from') is also used to express the agent in passive sentences, like English ''by''.

==Conjunctions==
Coordinating and subordinating [[grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] in Greek include:

!colspan="1" |Kinds

The word να ({{IPA|[na]}}) serves as a generic subordinator corresponding roughly to English ''to'' (+ infinitive) or ''that'' in sentences like προτιμώ να πάω ({{IPA|[protiˈmo na ˈpao]}}, 'I prefer to go', literally 'I prefer that I go') or προτιμώ να πάει ο Γιάννης ({{IPA|[protiˈmo na ˈpai o ˈʝannis]}}, 'I prefer that John go'). It marks the following verb as being in the [[subjunctive]] mood. Somewhat similar to the English ''to''-infinitive its use is often associated with meanings of non-factuality, i.e. events that have not (yet) come true, that are expected, wished for etc. In this, it contrasts with ότι {{IPA|[ˈoti]}} and πως {{IPA|[pos]}}, which correspond to English ''that'' when used with a meaning of factuality. The difference can be seen in the contrast between μας είπε να πάμε βόλτα ({{IPA|[mas ˈipe na ˈpame ˈvolta]}}, 'he told us to go for a walk') vs. μας είπε πως πήγε βόλτα ({{IPA|[mas ˈipe pos ˈpiʝe ˈvolta]}}, 'he told us that he went for a walk'). When used on its own with a following verb, να may express a wish or order, as in να πάει! ({{IPA|[na ˈpai]}}, 'let him go' or 'may he go'). Unlike the other subordinating conjunctions, να is always immediately followed by the verb it governs, separated from it only by any clitics that might be attached to the verb, but not by a subject or other clause-initial material.

==Negation==
For sentence negation, Greek has two distinct negation particles, δεν ([ˈðen], ''den'') and μη(ν)&lt;ref name="nu" group="note"/&gt; ([ˈmi(n)], ''mi(n)''). Δεν is used  in clauses with indicative mood, while μην is used primarily in subjunctive contexts, either after subjunctive-inducing να or as a negative replacement for να. Both particles are syntactically part of the [[proclitic]] group in front of the verb, and can be separated from the verb only by intervening clitic pronouns.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph and Philippaki-Warburton, 1987, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between δεν and μην is a particularly archaic feature in Greek, continuing an old [[Prohibitive mood|prohibitive]] negation marker inherited from Indo-European.&lt;ref name="Wackernagel"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jacob|last=Wackernagel|title=Lectures on syntax, with special reference to Greek, Latin, and Germanic. Edited by David Langslow|place=Oxford|publisher=University Press|year=2009|page=§11.258}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, μην is often associated with the expression of a wish for an event not to come true:

*'''Δεν''' του ζήτησα να έρθει. ('''''Den''' tou zitisa na erthei'', "I '''didn't''' ask him to come.")
*Του ζήτησα να '''μην''' έρθει. (''Tou zitisa na '''min''' erthei'', "I asked him '''not''' to come.")

When used alone with a subjunctive verb in the second person, prohibitive μην serves as the functional equivalent to a negative imperative, which itself cannot be negated. Thus, the negation of the positive imperative τρέξε ({{IPA|[ˈtrekse]}}, 'run!') is μην τρέξεις ({{IPA|[min ˈtreksis]}}, 'don't run!').

The particle όχι serves as the stand-alone utterance of negation ('no'), and also for negation of elliptical, verbless sentences and for contrastive negation of individual constituents:

*Κάλεσα την Μαρία, '''όχι''' τον Γιώργο. (''Kalesa tin Maria, '''ochi''' ton Giorgo'', "I invited Mary, '''not''' George.")

For constituent negation, Greek employs [[negative concord]]. The negated constituent is marked with a negative-polarity item (e.g. κανένας 'any, anybody/nobody', τίποτα 'anything/nothing', πουθενά 'anywhere/nowhere'), and the verb is additionally marked with the sentence negator δεν (or μην).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph and Philippaki-Warburton 1987, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; In verbless, elliptical contexts the negative-polarity items can also serve to express negation alone.

|}
The negative pronoun κανείς ([kaˈnis], ''kaneis''), i.e. ''nobody'' or ''anybody'' is declined in all three genders and three cases and can be used as the English determiner ''no''.

*Δεν θέλω κανέναν εδώ. (''Den thelo kanenan edo'', "I want nobody here.")
*—Είναι κανείς εδώ; —Όχι, κανείς. (''—Einai kaneis edo? —Ochi, kaneis'', "'Is anyone here?' 'No, nobody.'")
*Δεν έκανα κανένα λάθος. (''Den ekana kanena lathos'', "I have made no mistake.")

On the other hand, the negative pronoun ουδείς ([uˈðis], ''oudeis''), from the learned tradition of Ancient Greek, is used without negative concord:
*Ουδείς πείστηκε. (''Oudeis peistike'', "No one was convinced.")

==Relative clauses==
Greek has two different ways of forming relative clauses. The simpler and by far the more frequent uses the invariable [[relativizer]] που ({{IPA|[pu]}}, 'that', literally 'where'), as in: η γυναίκα που είδα χτες ({{IPA|[i ʝiˈneka pu ˈiða xtes]}}, 'the woman that I saw yesterday'). When the relativized element is a subject, object or adverbial within the relative clause, then – as in English – it has no other overt expression within the relative clause apart from the relativizer. Some other types of relativized elements, however, such as possessors, are represented within the clause by a resumptive pronoun, as in: η γυναίκα που βρήκα την τσάντα &lt;u&gt;της&lt;/u&gt; ({{IPA|/i ʝiˈneka pu ˈvrika tin ˈt͡sanda &lt;u&gt;tis&lt;/u&gt;/}}, 'the woman whose handbag I found', literally 'the woman that I found &lt;u&gt;her&lt;/u&gt; handbag').

The second and more formal form of relative clauses employs complex inflected [[relative pronoun]]s. They are composite elements consisting of the definite article and a following pronominal element that is inflected like an adjective: ο οποίος, η οποία, το οποίο ({{IPA|[o oˈpios, i oˈpia, to oˈpio]}} etc., literally 'the which'). Both elements are inflected for case, number and gender according to the grammatical properties of the relativized item within the relative clause, as in: η γυναίκα την οποία είδα χτες ({{IPA|[i ʝiˈneka tin oˈpia ˈiða xtes]}}, 'the woman whom I saw yesterday'); η γυναίκα της οποίας βρήκα την τσάντα ({{IPA|[i ʝiˈneka tis oˈpias ˈvrika tin ˈt͡sanda]}}, 'the woman whose handbag I found').

'''Najmadeen Mala''' (1898 in [[Sulaymaniyah]] – 23 April 1962 in Sulaymaniyah) was a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] writer, journalist and teacher. Najmadeen was the son of [[Mullah]] Ghafur Mullah Ali. He worked in [[Ranya]] but moved to [[Halab]] in Syria.

Later, he returned to [[Sulaimani]] and founded a school, which he ran for 40 years. He also owned a book store.

==Literary career==
He had a weekly column called "Child Story" in the newspaper ''Zheen''. He wrote biographies on notable figures and poets. He published more than 90 stories, most of them [[folkloric]].

He wrote several valuable works on [[Kurdish history]] and literature. Najmadeen Mala died on 23 April 1962, and was buried on Azmar Mountain in Sulaimani.

[[File:Niklaus Meienberg.jpg|thumb|Niklaus Meienberg]]
'''Niklaus Meienberg''' (11 May 1940 &amp;ndash; 22 September 1993) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] writer and [[investigative journalist]].

Meienberg lived in Zürich and published 14 books in his lifetime. His works were primarily about recent Swiss history. His texts are used as exemplars in Swiss journalism schools.

Meienberg's best works were compiled in the book ''St.&amp;nbsp;Fiden Paris Oerlikon''. This book was republished in 2005/06 as part of the series ''[[Schweizer Bibliothek]]'' (a series of 20 of the most important Swiss books).

==Life==
Meienberg was born 1940 in [[St. Gallen]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} After five years in the convent school in [[Disentis]], the 20-year-old went to the [[United States|U.S.]] for one year. In [[New York City]] he worked as a clerk for the ''Federation of [[Migros]] Cooperatives'' and in [[Vancouver]], Canada, as a bulldozer driver.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

On his return to Switzerland, he was ready to study. As a main subject, he chose history (at the [[University of Fribourg]], then at the [[ETH Zurich]] and later thanks to a stipend, in [[Paris]]). During his years of study he reportedly was a member of a reactionary secret society. In Paris he experienced the riots of May 1968.

He finished his studies in Fribourg with the title of a „lic. phil.“ and the licentiate work
''De Gaulle und die USA von 1940 bis 42'' (''De Gaulle and the USA from 1940 to 42'').

From 1966 on, he was a Paris correspondent for the ''[[Weltwoche]]'', for five years. Starting in 1971, he reported for the [[SRG SSR idée suisse|Swiss national television’s]] culture show ''Perspektiven'' (“Perspectives”) and lots of productions for the [[SRG SSR idée suisse|Swiss national radio’s]] transmissions, such as the satirical transmission ''Faktenordner'' („Facts Folder“). Meanwhile, he became a freelancer for the Zurich newspaper ''[[Tages-Anzeiger]]'' and the Tages-Anzeiger's magazine ''Magazin'' (today named ''Das Magazin''.)

After 1976, he was banned from writing for the Tages-Anzeiger because of his criticisms of both Swiss history and contemporary Switzerland. The longtime ban was imposed by publisher Otto Coning against the editorial staff's wishes.

In 1977 had to go to court because of scenes of his movie ''Die Erschiessung des Landesverräters Ernst S.'' (English meaning: “The execution of the national betrayer Ernst S.”) and because of a planned theatre play about [[Ulrich Wille]]. Meienberg, who was represented by leftist [[Moritz Leuenberger]], a later member of the Bundesrat (Swiss Federal Council), won the process against the two sons of Wille.

From 1982 to 83, Niklaus Meienberg was head of the Paris Bureau of the German magazine ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]''. Afterwards, he was a freelancer for the weekly newspaper ''WOZ'' and acted as a writer.

In spring 1987, he wrote a critical and heavy discussed biography of Ulrich Wille and his family for the ''Weltwoche''. During fall of the same year, it was published as a book with the title ''Die Welt als Wille und Wahn'' (literally: “The World as Will and Delusion”). The German title is a play on words: “Wille” is not only a German word for “will”/”intention”, but means the surname of Ulrich Wille, too. The title in turn seems to be a reference to German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Arthur Schopenhauer’s]] (1788–1860) main work “Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung” (“The World as Will and Representation”, sometimes also known in English as “The World as Will and Idea”)

Meienberg's penmanship found a lot few other sophisticated word-plays, too: In "Die Erschiessung des Landesverräters Ernst S." he calls the traitor's execution "Tells Geschoss" (Tell's projectile"), because the executor shot through the betrayer's eye, like Tell shot through an apple, and the macabre punchline is as follows: in German, the "eyeball" is literally called "eye apple".
Even Meienberg's book's titles attest a liking for word jokes (e.g. "The make-believing of true facts" that inverts "Die Vorspiegelung falscher Tatsachen", which is a set phrase in the world of German-speaking courts and jurisdiction.)

The above-mentioned report is partially based on photographs of unpublished letters that Wille wrote to his wife. The exclusive photographs were taken by Meienberg without permission - they were exposed as pieces of scenery in an exhibition. In the Afterword, Meienberg, admitted this fact as follows:

''The guard commanding supervisor of the local museum [[Meilen]] never had flipped open the book, but was happy that its content pleased me and photographer [[Roland Gretler]] that much, and didn’t mind me excerpting any passages of the text or Roland Gretler integrally photographing a few dozens of pages.''

Meienberg committed suicide on 22 September 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Quinche|editor1-first=Florence|editor2-last=Rodriguez|editor2-first=Antonio|last=de Roulet|first=Daniel|title=Quelle éthique pour la littérature?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IaT537ci3xcC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aZ9vb5r8bj&amp;sig=K3NHleGglEOWD96iU0NlQvDaonc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=za4kSqWwNaHFtgec69zsBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#PPA243,M1|accessdate=2 June 2009|year=2007|publisher=Labor et Fides|language=French|isbn=978-2-8309-1225-8|page=243|chapter=Le Journalisme Aime La Morale, La Littérature Préfère L'Ironie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the media, the suicide of Meienberg caused a big echo. The Austrian writer [[Erich Hackl]] thinks, Meienberg killed himself, because he was no longer able to cope with the direction of the world. A doctor would trace this back to untreated [[Clinical depression|depression]]. In his last letters Meienberg called himself an “expiring model” (of a journalist?), original text: “auslaufendes Modell”.

Niklaus Meienberg's [[literary remains]] are conserved in the [[Swiss Literary Archives]] in [[Bern]], that amongst others also conserves the literary remains of famous names like [[Albert Einstein]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Patricia Highsmith]] and [[Adolf Muschg]].

In 1998, Meienberg's former lover, Aline Graf, published a book with the title ''Der andere Niklaus Meienberg'' (''The other Niklaus Meienberg''), in which she describes the eight years she was his lover. She writes rather negatively about him, says that he had held her too tight and his body had looked like a cockchafer grub. Graf was invited to talk shows, gave interviews, had a big media presence. Her book received rather bad reviews in Switzerland's papers and magazines, only in Germany were some positive voices. Her style was found dirty and polluting, she was supposed to being keen on media presence.

The Swiss, that defended Meienberg, were disgusted and angry. Graf wanted to leave the country to recover in the Netherlands for a while.

The '''Nukak language''' is a language of uncertain classification, perhaps part of the small [[Nadahup languages|Nadahup (Makú)]] language family. It is mutually intelligible with [[Kakwa language|Kakwa]].&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Politis, ''Nukak: Ethnoarchaeology of an Amazonian People,'' Left Coast Press, Walnut Creek, California (2007) 2009 p.53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
There are six oral and six nasal vowels.

{| class="wikitable"
|
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! [[Central vowel|Central]]
! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| align="left" | i ĩ
| align="center" | ɨ  ɨ̃
| align="center" | u ũ
|-

| align="center" |
| align="right" | ʌ ʌ̃
|-
! [[Open vowel|Low]]
| align="center" |
| align="center" | a ã
| align="center" |
|}

The vowel {{IPA|[u]}} becomes the labial semivowel {{IPA|[w]}} in several environments: in postnuclear position (when it appears immediately after the nuclear vowel of a morpheme), before another vowel, and at the beginning of the word or syllable. The semivowel {{IPA|[w]}} is devoiced (IPA symbol {{IPA|[ʍ]}}) if the [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] rises and the following vowel is {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[ĩ]}}, {{IPA|[ɨ]}}. 

The vowel {{IPA|[i]}} becomes the palatal semivowel {{IPA|[j]}} in postnuclear position.

===Consonants===

There are eleven consonant phonemes: {{IPA|/p/}}; {{IPA|/b/}} (realized as {{IPA|[m]}} with a nasal vowel, otherwise as {{IPA|[mb]}} at the start of a word, and as {{IPA|[bm]}} at the end of a word); {{IPA|/t/}}; {{IPA|/d/}} (realized as {{IPA|[n]}} with a nasal vowel, otherwise as {{IPA|[nd]}} at the start of a word, and as {{IPA|[dn]}} at the end of a word); {{IPA|/tʃ/}} (realized as {{IPA|[ts]}} or {{IPA|[tʃ]}} in free variation); {{IPA|/ɟ/}} (realized as {{IPA|[ɲ]}} in a nasal environment); {{IPA|/k/}}; {{IPA|/ɡ/}} (realized as {{IPA|[ŋ]}} in a nasal environment); {{IPA|/ɺ/}} (lateral sonorant, alternating with the approximant {{IPA|[ɹ]}}, the tap {{IPA|[ɾ]}}, and the lateral approximant {{IPA|[l]}}); {{IPA|/h/}}; {{IPA|/ʔ/}} (the glottal stop). 

The following table of consonant phonemes shows each phoneme followed by the corresponding letter in the Nukak alphabet, where different.

|}

{{IPA|/ɺ/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[t]}} when followed by {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|[d]}} when preceded by a voiced consonant. If {{IPA|/ɟ/}} is preceded by {{IPA|[t]}} or {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, it is pronounced voiceless {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}}. With some infixes or prefixes, {{IPA|/ʔ/}} is replaced by {{IPA|/n/}} when it is followed by any vowel or {{IPA|/h/}} or in nasal {{IPA|[n]}} suffixes.

The voiced palatal allophones {{IPA|[ɟ]}} ~ {{IPA|[ɲ]}} can be considered variants of the vowel {{IPA|[i]}} when they precede a vowel in the initial position of a root or of an affix, or when they lie between two vowels.

===Tones===

The nuclear vowels of [[noun]]s, [[verb]]s, and [[adjective]]s bear tone.  Nukak has two tonemes (minimal pairs exist between them): high and rising. In the surface phonology there are also a low tone and a falling tone. The rising and falling tones are accompanied by lengthening of the vowel. However, the falling tone has been analyzed as actually being the allomorph of the high tone in closed syllables ending in an occlusive consonant or {{IPA|[h]}} or in morpheme final open syllables. Unaccented syllables always bear the low tone. 

The high and rising tones occur only in monosyllabic, monomorphemic [[lexeme]]s. Multisyllabic morphemes are stressed on the first syllable.

==Grammar==
===Typology===

The default word order in sentences is [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV). In any case, the subject always precedes the object. Verbs are conjugated for person. The language is [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]]. The grammatical and lexical meanings expressed by prepositions in the Indo-European languages are expressed by suffixes in Nukak. Adjectives, which are not inflected for grammatical gender, usually follow their head noun.

===Noun===
The Nukak nouns are marked for gender, number, and case. There are two [[grammatical gender]]s. The plural of animate nouns is indicated with the suffix -''wɨn''. Case markers include the following:
:[[accusative]] -''na''
:[[dative]] -''ré' '' ("to")
:[[instrumental case|instrumental]] -''hî'''  ("with")
:[[locative]] -''rí' ''  ("in", "by")
:[[genitive]] -''î ' '' ("of", "belongs to")

Depending on the noun lexeme, the vocative case is expressed by a tone change; by the suffix -''a'';  or by duplicating the nuclear vowel after the root final consonant. 

Nouns can take tense suffixes, e.g., -''hîpî' '', "that [masculine] which came before", and a question suffix, -''má' ''.  The connective formative -''tɨ'' expresses either coordination with another noun, i.e., "also", or the clause conjunction, "and". 

Noun classifying suffixes are common: -''na' ''  (long and slender), -''da' ''  "small and round", -''dub'' "small, slender, and pointed", -''nɨi'' "flat and thin", -''ne'' "long-haired", -''yi'' "abundant, profuse".

===Pronouns===
{| class="wikitable"

| align="center" | ''wéem''

| align="center" | ''kun' ''

|}

Possessive pronouns are free forms: ''wî' '' "mine", ''mí' '' "yours singular",  ''aî' '' "his", ''mi'î' '' "hers", ''wîi' '' "our", ''ñí' '' "yours plural, ''i'î' '' "theirs". The relations "my, your, her", etc. are expressed with prefixes on the possessed noun: ''wa'' "my", ''ma'' "your singular", ''a'', "his", ''mi'' "her", ''hi'' "our", ''ñi'' "your plural", ''i'' "their". In conjugation, the same prefixes are agent (subject) markers. They occur either with or without personal pronouns.

====Interrogative words====
''déi'' ("what?" "which" referring to things), ''de pán'' "what?" referring to actions, ''háu'ka'', ''de'e'' "who?", ''déimɨnɨ'' "when?", ''ded'' "where?", ''jáu' '' why?". They combine with various other markers, e.g., [[case (grammar)|case]] suffixes: the [[allative]] ''de' yúkú'' "towards where?", the  [[instrumental case|instrumental]] ''de'e hin'' "with whom?", the genitive ''de'e î' '' "whose?". Interrogatives combine with tense markers as in ''jáu' ra' '' ("due to what?" + recent past).

===Verbs===
Verbs are conjugated with a subject prefix and with suffixes and infixes expressing [[aspect (linguistics)|aspect]] (continuous, immediate); [[grammatical tense|tense]] (past, present, future) and [[grammatical mood|mood]] (imperative, desiderative, interrogative). For example:
:[[Past tense|Past]] -''nábé''
:[[Future tense|Future]] -''nátu' ''
::dubitative -''náhitu'
:[[Conditional tense|Conditional]] -'náno' ''
:[[Present tense|Present]]
::imperfect  -''náka''
::negative -''kaná''
::continuing -''né' ''
:Interrogative
::past -''yáa''
::future -''pî' ''
::conditional -''no'pî' ''
::present -''ráa' ''
:::negative -''ka''
:Desiderative -''iná''- ("perhaps")
:Planeative -''ɨí' ''- ("to plan" an action)
:Repetitive -''pî''- ("repeatedly")
:Agentive -''rít'' ("because", "due to")

The [[imperative mood]] is formed by duplicating the last vowel of the verb stem, after the root final consonant or semivowel. The vowels [u] and [i] are pronounced as semivowels [w], [j] when duplicated after the final consonant. 

The past imperfect is formed by suffixing to the stem the duplicate of the last vowel in the stem plus [p]:  (-VC-Vp). The combination of the past imperfect suffix with the marker -''tí´ '' marks a past [[subjunctive]]: ''jɨm'' "to be"; ''jɨmɨ'' "may have been",; past imperfect ''jɨmɨp'' "was"; subjunctive preterite ''jɨmɨptí´ '' "if it were".

Verbal negation is expressed in different ways: with the suffix -''ka'', which comes between the verb root and the tense, mood, and aspect markers; with certain prefixes to the verb stem; with the words ''yab´ '', "no", ''dɨi´ '', "refuse", ''îí´ '', "without effect" . Negative commands have a specific marker, -''kê´ ''.

There are many compound verbs. The elements may be two or more verb roots or they may be a verb root plus a noun, adjective, or adverb. The marker -''a'' converts an intransitive verb root into a transitive verb. 

Verbs are nominalized with the suffixes -''hát'', the abstract idea of the action, -''pe' '', the affected object, participle. The agent of the action is indicated with the agentive ("actance") prefix and a suffix expressing person and number. The agentive suffixes are -''ni' '' for the first person, second person, and third person singular feminine; -''ni'' for the third person singular masculine; and -''nit'' for the third person plural. To these may be added the marker for imminence, currently in progress, or emphasis, -''yé' ''.

All verb roots end in a consonant or semivowel. The meaning "to be" can be expressed in two ways: explicitly with the verb ''jɨm'' or tacitly through the various interrogative markers along with the personal pronouns, and occasionally with another verb, ''yit'', which has the emphatic form ''yittí' '', "I am".

===Adverbs===
The Nukak language has many adverb forms. Various adverbs are important in the construction of sentences. For example, they frequently use ''hébáká'' "indeed", and for even greater insistence, -''yé' is suffixed. The verbal link ''tɨtíma'hî'' "after" can occur between the subject and the object and verb. Morphologically, some adverbs are independent words; these can follow nouns, like ''hattí' '' "also", "neither", "yet". There are some adverbial suffixes, e.g., -''hê' '' "only", "precisely".

===Interjections===
''Kútu' '' "Hey!", "Attention!" is an exclamation said in order to begin to speak. Other exclamatory words or phrases are ''hâré'' "Be careful!" or ''dɨpí hâré'' "Be very careful!"; ''waá'yé' '' "Enough!; ''be'bét yé' '' "Hurry up!"; ''ni'kábá'í' '' "That's it!".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3129">In [[morpheme]]-based [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], the term '''null allomorph''' or '''zero allomorph''' is sometimes used to refer to some kind of [[null morpheme]] for which there are also contexts in which the [[underlying representation|underlying]] morpheme is manifested in the [[surface structure]]. It is therefore also an [[allomorph]]. The phenomenon itself is known as ''null allomorphy'', ''morphological blocking'' or ''total morpheme blocking''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://169.229.248.181/dissertations/Pycha_dissertation_2008.pdf Anne Pycha, ''Morphological Sources of Phonological Length'', 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==English==
An example of null allomorphy in English is the [[phrase]] ''two fish-∅'' which cannot be ''two fish-es''. In addition, according to some linguists such as Radford, in [[language acquisition|children's language]] the forms of many [[auxiliary verb]]s such as ''do'' have null allomorphs in [[tense (grammar)|tenseless]] [[clause]]s such as ''Teddy not go''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jTZ5Fq6DJSQC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=%22null+allomorph%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PCbu_xLSuI&amp;sig=biTtfkqwPyyQbLIMwBNZaQ1uxiA&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=6lHOSsTEN86Q-Abc1b2KAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#v=onepage&amp;q=%22null%20allomorph%22&amp;f=fals Barbara Lust, Margarita Suñer, John Whitman, ''Syntactic Theory and First Language Acquisition: Heads, projections, and learnability'', 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

==French==
Main article: [[Liaison (French)]]

[[French language|French]] has many words ending in a "silent consonant", which is written but not pronounced before a pause or a word beginning with a consonant. It reappears in the case of [[liaison (French)|liaison]], e.g. between an article and a nominal syntagm, an epithet adjective and the noun, an adverb and the adjective it modifies, etc. If the following word begins with a vowel (or an "h muet"). Maybe the most common case is that of the [[article (grammar)|article]]s "les, un, des, aux", etc.: e.g. "les hommes" [lezɔm] (the men) where the -s of the article is realized as [z], vs. "les femmes" [lefam] (the women) where it is silent.

==German==
Null allomorphy occurs a lot in the grammar of the [[German language]]. The [[Grammatical number|singular]] form of the [[dative case]] of masculine and neuter nouns such as ''der Mann'' (the man) has an optional grammatical suffix ''-e'': ''dem Mann-e''. However, this suffix is somewhat archaic today and is mainly used in written language. In other cases, its null allomorph occurs: ''dem Mann-∅''.

==Dutch==
To some extent, null allomorphs also occur in the [[Dutch language]]. Many Dutch [[compound word]]s have an [[interfix]] ''-s'' which is completely optional: both ''doodkist'' and ''doodskist'' ("coffin") are possible, as it is the case with ''spellingprobleem'' and ''spellingsprobleem'' ("spelling problem").&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}}[http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/FonetischeVereniging/Bijeenkomsten/NijmegenMPI_090606.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nyenkha''' ([[Dzongkha]]: འནྱེན་ཁ་; [[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]: ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;Nyen-kha''; also called "'Nyenkha", "Henkha", "Lap", "Nga Ked", and "Mangsdekha") is an [[East Bodish languages|East Bodish language]] spoken by about 10,000 people in the eastern, northern, and western areas of the [[Black Mountains (Bhutan)|Black Mountains]].&lt;ref name=JBS&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Bhutan Studies |volume=24 |date=Summer 2011 |first=Jagar |last=Dorji |title=Hen Kha: A Dialect of Mangde Valley in Bhutan |url=http://www.bhutanstudies.org.bt/pubFiles/JBS_24/04%20Henka_JDorji.pdf |format=PDF |pages=69–86 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127042612/http://www.bhutanstudies.org.bt/pubFiles/JBS_24/04%20Henka_JDorji.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers live primarily between the [[Tang Chuu]] to the east and [[Mangde Chhu]] to the west, from the town of [[Trongsa]] in [[Trongsa District]]; along [[Mangde Chhu|Black River]] passes in the Trongsa District villages of Taktse and Usar; to in Ridha and Tashiding villages, and [[Phobji Gewog|Phobji]], [[Dangchu Gewog|Dangchu]], and [[Sephu Gewog]]s and surrounding villages in southeast [[Wangdue Phodrang District]].&lt;ref name=vanDriem93&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.forcedmigration.org/pdf/?pid=fmo:3003 |format=PDF |last=van Driem |first=George L. |authorlink=George van Driem |title=Language Policy in Bhutan |publisher=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]] |location=[[London]] |year=1993 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SIL1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=neh |title=Nyenkha |work=[[Ethnologue]] Online |publisher=[[SIL International]] |location=[[Dallas]] |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyenkha is related to the East Bodish [[Bumthang language|Bumthangkha]] and [[Kurtöp language|Kurtöpkha]],&lt;ref name=SIL1/&gt; with 75–77% and 69% lexical similarity, respectively,&lt;ref name=JBS/&gt;{{rp|76}} however they are not mutually intelligible. Dialects within Nyenkha show variation in tone and vocabulary. Dialects are generally named for their [[villages of Bhutan|villages]], such that names for the overall language are largely confined to academia.&lt;ref name=JBS/&gt;{{rp|72–74}}

==Population==
The 1991 census revealed 11,472 Nyenkha speakers in six [[gewogs of Bhutan]]. In 1993, the number of speakers was around 10,000 according to [[George van Driem|van Driem]].&lt;ref name=vanDriem93/&gt; A 2010 study showed about 8700 speakers in 10 gewogs, which had been redrawn several times since 1991. The decline in numbers may be attributed to population shifts as landless families and former [[slash-and-burn]] agriculturalists relocate to areas opened for settlement. In addition to migration and movement, modernization trends have served to limit the practicality of Nyenkha as a fully functional language. Despite the decline in numbers and a shift toward bilingualism, the majority of young people remain fluent in the language.&lt;ref name=JBS/&gt;{{rp|81–82}}

Many speakers of Nyen have extensive contact with other [[languages of Bhutan]], often through trade. Traditionally, Nyen speakers raised sheep and other livestock for Labi speakers{{cn|date=September 2014}} in exchange for cereals from lower altitudes. The communities also traditionally shared [[Bon]]po orators.&lt;ref name=JBS/&gt;{{rp|76}}

==Vocabulary==
Nyenkha basic vocabulary shows significant difference to [[Kurtöp language|Kurtöp (Zhake)]], a sister East Bodish language, and to [[Dzongkha]], the national language.&lt;ref name=JBS/&gt;{{rp|78–79}}

[[File:Autograph score of part of Act2 (Wolf's Glen) of 'Der Freischütz' - NGO4p1116.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A hand-written [[Sheet music|musical score]] for Act 2 of the [[opera]] ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' by [[Carl Maria von Weber]], written in the 1820s. The score contains all the parts for the singers and the [[accompaniment]] parts and melodies for the [[orchestra]].]]
'''Orchestration''' is the study or practice of writing [[music]] for an [[orchestra]] (or, more loosely, for any [[musical ensemble]], such as a [[concert band]]) or of adapting music composed for another medium for an orchestra. Also called "instrumentation", orchestration is the selection of different instruments to play the different parts (e.g., [[melody]], [[bassline]], etc.) of a musical work. For example, a work for solo piano could be adapted and orchestrated so that an orchestra could perform the piece, or a concert band piece could be orchestrated for a symphony orchestra.

Only gradually over the course of music history did orchestration come to be regarded as a separate compositional art and profession in itself. In [[classical music]], most [[composer]]s write the [[melody|melodies]], [[chord progression]] and [[musical form]] for a piece and, then, if they want the piece to be played by an orchestra, they orchestrate the piece themselves. In [[musical theatre]], however, the composer typically writes the [[melody|melodies]] and then hires a professional [[arranger]] or orchestrator to devise the parts for the [[pit orchestra]] to play.

Similarly, when a film company is making a film score, a composer thinks up the main melodies and themes for the score, and then one or more orchestrators are hired to "flesh out" these basic melodies by adding [[accompaniment]] parts, [[bassline]]s, backing chords, and so on. In jazz [[big band]]s, the composer or [[songwriter]] writes the [[lead sheet]], which contains the melody and the chords, and then one or more orchestrators or arrangers "flesh out" these basic musical ideas by creating parts for the saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and the [[rhythm section]] (bass, piano/[[jazz guitar]]/[[Hammond organ]], drums).

==As profession==
An '''orchestrator''' is a trained musical professional who assigns instruments from an [[orchestra]] or other [[musical ensemble]] to a piece of music written by a [[composer]], or who adapts music composed for another medium for an orchestra. Orchestrators may work for [[musical theatre]] productions, [[film production]] companies or [[recording studio]]s. Some orchestrators teach at colleges, conservatories or universities. The training done by orchestrators varies. Most have completed formal postsecondary education in music, such as a [[Bachelor of Music]] (B.Mus.), [[Master of Music]] (M.Mus.) or an artist's diploma. Orchestrators who teach at universities, colleges and conservatories may be required to hold a master's degree or a Doctorate (the latter may be a Ph.D. or a D.M.A). Orchestrators who work for film companies, musical theatre companies and other organizations may be hired solely based on their orchestration experience, even if they do not hold academic credentials. In the 2010s, as the percentage of faculty holding [[terminal degree]]s and/or Doctoral degrees is part of how an institution is rated, this is causing an increasing number of postsecondary institutions to require terminal and/or Doctoral degrees.

==In practice==
The term ''orchestration'' in its specific sense refers to the way instruments are used to portray any musical aspect such as [[melody]], [[harmony]] or [[rhythm]]. For example, a C [[major chord]] is made up of the notes [[C (musical note)|C]], [[E (musical note)|E]], and [[G (musical note)|G]]. If the notes are held out the entire duration of a [[bar (music)|measure]], the composer or orchestrator will have to decide what instrument(s) play this chord and in what [[Register (music)|register]]. Some instruments, including [[woodwinds]] and [[brass]] are [[Monophony|monophonic]] and can only play one note of the chord at a time. However, in a full orchestra there are more than one of these instruments, so the composer may choose to outline the chord in its basic form with a group of [[clarinets]] or [[trumpets]] (with separate instruments each being given one of the three notes of the chord). Other instruments, including the [[string instrument|strings]], [[piano]], [[harp]], and pitched [[percussion]] are [[polyphonic]] and may play more than one note at a time. As such, if the composer/orchestrator wishes to have the strings play the C major chord, she could assign the low C to the cellos and basses, the G to the violas, and then a high E to the second [[violin]]s and an E an octave higher to the first violins. If the composer/orchestrator wishes the chord to be played only by the first and second violins, she could give the second violins a low C and give the first violins a [[double stop]] of the notes G (an open string) and E.

Additionally in orchestration, notes may be placed into another register (such as transposed down for the [[string bass|basses]]), doubled (both in the same and different octaves), and altered with various levels of dynamics.  The choice of instruments, registers, and dynamics affect the overall [[timbre|tone color]].  If the C major chord was orchestrated for the [[trumpet]]s and [[trombone]]s playing [[fortissimo]] in their upper registers, it would sound very bright; but if the same chord was orchestrated for the [[cello|celli]] and [[string bass]]es playing [[sul tasto]], doubled by the [[bassoon]]s and [[bass clarinet]], it might sound heavy and dark.

Note that although the above example discussed orchestrating a chord, a melody or even a single note may be orchestrated in this fashion. Also note that in this specific sense of the word, ''orchestration'' is not necessarily limited to an orchestra, as a composer may ''orchestrate'' this same C major chord for, say, a [[woodwind quintet]], a [[string quartet]] or a [[concert band]]. Each different ensemble would enable the orchestrator/composer to create different tone "colours" and timbres.

A [[melody]] is also orchestrated. The composer or orchestrator may think of a melody in her head, or while playing the piano or organ. Once she has thought of a melody, she has to decide which instrument (or instruments) will play the melody. One widely used approach for a melody is to assign it to the first violins. When the first violins play a melody, the composer can have the second violins double the melody an octave below, or have the second violins play a harmony part (often in thirds and sixths). Sometimes, for a forceful effect, a composer will indicate in the score that all of the strings (violins, violas, cellos, and double basses) will play the melody in unison, at the same time. Typically, even though the instruments are playing the same note names, the violins will play very high-register notes, the violas and cellos will play lower-register notes, and the double basses will play the deepest, lowest pitches.

As well, the [[woodwinds]] and [[brass instrument]]s can effectively carry a melody, depending on the effect the composer/orchestrator desires. The [[trumpet]]s can perform a melody in a powerful, high register. Alternatively, if the trombones play a melody, the pitch will be lower than the trumpet, and the tone will be heavier, which may change the musical effect that is created. While the [[cello]]s are often given an [[accompaniment]] role in orchestration, there are notable cases where the cellos have been assigned the melody. In even more rare cases, the double bass section (or principal bass) may be given a melody (e.g., the high-register double bass solo in [[Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Lieutenant Kije Suite]]'').

While assigning a melody to a particular section, such as the string section or the woodwinds will work well, as the stringed instruments and all the woodwinds blend together well, some composers give the melody to one section and then have the melody doubled by a different section or an instrument from a different section. For example, a melody played by the first violins could be doubled by the [[glockenspiel]], which would add a sparkling, chime-like colour to the melody. Alternatively, a melody played by the piccolos could be doubled by the [[celesta]], which would add a bright tone to the sound.

In the 20th and 21st century, [[contemporary composer]]s began to incorporate [[music technology (electric)|electric]] and [[music technology (electronic and digital)|electronic]] instruments into the orchestra, such as the [[electric guitar]] played through a [[guitar amplifier]], the [[electric bass]] played through a [[bass amplifier]], the [[Theremin]] and the [[synthesizer]]. The addition of these new instruments gave composers new options for creating tonal "colours" in their orchestration. For example, in the late 20th century and onwards, a composer could have a melody played by the first violins doubled by a futuristic-sounding [[synthesizer]] or a [[theremin]] to create an unusual effect.

Orchestral instrumentation is denoted by an abbreviated formulaic convention,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Orchestral Music a Handbook|last=Daniels|first=David|publisher=Scarecrow Press Inc.|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows: [[flute]], [[oboe]], [[clarinet]], [[bassoon]]- horn, [[trumpet]], [[trombone]], [[tuba]]. More details can be contained in brackets. A dot separates one player from another, a slash indicates doubling. Timpani and percussion are denoted 2Tmp+ number of percussion.

For example, 3[1.2.3/pic] 2[1.Eh] 3[1.2.3/Ebcl/bcl] 3[1.2/cbn.cbn] tmp+2 is interpreted as:

* 3 flautists, the 3rd doubling on piccolo ("doubling" means that the performer can play flute and piccolo)
* 
* 2 oboists, the 2nd playing English horn throughout
* 
* 3 clarinetists, the 3rd doubling also on E-flat clarinet and bass clarinet
* 
* 3 bassoonists, the 2nd doubling on contrabassoon, the 3rd playing only contra
* 
* Timpani+ 2 percussion.

As an example, Mahler Symphony 2 is scored: 4[1/pic.2/pic.3/pic.4/pic] 4[1.2.3/Eh.4/Eh] 5[1.2.3/bcl.4/Ebcl2.Ebcl] 4[1.2.3.4/cbn]- 10 8 4 1- 2tmp+4-2&amp;nbsp;hp- org- str.

==Examples from the repertoire==

===J.S Bach===
During the [[Baroque]] era, composers showed increasing awareness of the expressive potential of orchestration.  While some early Baroque pieces have no indication of which instruments should play the piece, the choice of instruments being left to the musical group's leader or [[concertmaster]], there are Baroque works which specify certain instruments. The orchestral accompaniment to the aria 'et misericordia' from J.S.Bach’s ''[[Magnificat]]'', BWV243 (1723) features muted strings [[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubled]] by flutes, a subtle combination of mellow instrumental [[timbres]].[[File:Et misericordia.png|thumb|center|500px|Orchestral introduction to 'et misericordia' from Bach's Magnificat, BWV 243. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om6FA-8Rs5I Listen]]]

The orchestral introduction to the opening chorus of J.S.Bach’s [[epiphany (holiday)|epiphany]] Cantata [[Sie werden aus Saba alle kommen, BWV 65|''Sie werden aus Saba alle kommen'']] BWV65, which [[John Eliot Gardiner]] (2013, p.&amp;nbsp;328) describes as “one of the crowning glories of Bach’s first Christmas season” demonstrates the composer’s mastery of his craft.  Within a space of eight bars, we hear recorders, [[oboe da caccia|oboes da caccia]], horns and strings creating a “glittery sheen” of contrasted timbres, sonorities and textures ranging from just two horns against a string [[pedal point]] in the first bar to a “restatement of the octave unison theme, this time by all the voices and instruments spread over five octaves” in bars 7-8:&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, J.E. (2013, p. 328) ''Music in the Castle of Heaven''.  London, Allen Lane.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Opening orchestral introduction to J.S. Bach's Cantata, BWV65.wav|thumb|Opening orchestral introduction to J.S. Bach's Cantata, BWV65.]][[File:Sie werden aus Saba Alle kommen opening bars.png|thumb|center|600px|Opening orchestral introduction to J.S. Bach's Cantata, BWV65. ]]

Igor Stravinsky (1959, p45) marvelled at Bach’s skill as an orchestrator: “What incomparable instrumental writing is Bach's. You can smell the resin [(rosin)] in his violin parts, [and] taste the reeds in the 
oboes.”&lt;ref&gt;Stravinsky I. and Craft, R. ''Conversations with Igor Stravinsky''.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rameau===
Jean Philippe [[Rameau]] was famous for "the eloquence of [his] orchestral writing which was something entirely new... - with a feeling for colour [(i.e., tone colour or timbre)] that is altogether 'modern'."&lt;ref&gt;Pincherle, M. (1967, p.122) ''An Illustrated History of Music''.  London, MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; In 'The Entrance of Polymnie' from his opera ''[[Les Boréades]]'' (1763), the predominant string texture is shot through with descending scale figures on the bassoon, creating an exquisite blend of timbres:[[File:Entry of Polymnie from les Boreades.wav|thumb|'L'Entrée de Polymnie' from ''Les Boréades'' by Rameau.]][[File:Entry of Polymnie from les Boreades.png|thumb|center|500px|'L'Entrée de Polymnie' from ''Les Boréades'' by Rameau.]]

===Mozart===
Another important technique of orchestration was [[call and response (music)|antiphony]], the "call and response" exchange of musical motifs or "ideas" between different groups in the orchestra. In an antiphonal section, the composer may have one group of instruments introduce a melodic idea (e.g., the first violins), and then have the woodwinds "answer" by restating this melodic idea, often with some type of variation. In the trio section of the minuet from Mozart’s [[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 41]] (1788), the flute, bassoons and horn exchange phrases with the strings, with the first violin line [[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubled]] at the [[octave]] by the first oboe:[[File:Mozart Jupiter Symphony Trio.wav|thumb|Trio section of the Minuet from Mozart's Symphony No. 41.]] [[File:Mozart Jupiter Trio.png|thumb|center|500px|Trio section of the Minuet from Mozart's Symphony No. 41. ]] Charles Rosen (1971, p.&amp;nbsp;240) admires Mozart’s skill in orchestrating his piano concertos, particularly the [[Piano Concerto No. 22 (Mozart)|Concerto in E flat major, K482]], a work that introduced clarinets into the mix.  “This concerto places the greatest musical reliance on tone colour, which is, indeed, almost always ravishing.  One lovely example of its sonorities comes near the beginning.” &lt;ref&gt;Rosen, C. (1971, p240) The Classical Style.  London Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Mozart Piano Concerto 22 first movement opening.wav|thumb|Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars  1-12]][[File:Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 1-6.png|thumb|center|500px|Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 1-6]] 
 
The orchestral [[tutti]] in the first two bars is answered by just horns and bassoon in bars 2-6.  This passage repeats with fresh orchestration: [[File:Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 7-12.png|thumb|center|500px|Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 7-12. ]]“Here we have the unusual sound on the violins providing the bass for the solo clarinets.  The simplicity of the sequence concentrates all our interest on tone-colour, and what follows – a series of woodwind solos – keeps it there.  The orchestration throughout, in fact, has a greater variety than Mozart had wished or needed before, and fits the brilliance, charm, and grace of the first movement and the finale.” &lt;ref&gt;Rosen, C. (1971, p240) The Classical Style.  London Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beethoven===
A demonstration of Beethoven’s consummate skill at obtaining the maximum variety out of seemingly unprepossessing and fairly simple material can be found in the first movement of the [[Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 5|Piano Concerto No. 5]] in E flat (‘The Emperor’) Opus 73 (1810). The [[sonata form|second subject of the sonata form]] is a deceptively simple tune that, according to Fiske (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;41) “is limited to notes playable on the horns for which it music have been specially designed.”&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, R. (1970), ''Beethoven Concertos and Overtures''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; This theme appears in five different orchestrations throughout the movement, with changes of [[Mode (music)|mode]] (major to minor), [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] ([[forte (music)|forte]] to [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]]) and a blending of instrumental [[Timbre|colour]] that ranges from boldly stated [[tutti]] passages to the most subtle and differentiated episodes, where instrumental sounds are combined often in quite unexpected ways:[[File:Second subject theme from the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (Emperor).wav|thumb|Second subject theme from the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (Emperor)]][[File:Subsidiary theme from the first movement of beethoven's Piano Conxcert No. 5 (Emperor).png|thumb|center|600px|Second subject theme from the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (Emperor)]]

The theme first appears in the minor mode during the orchestral introduction, performed using [[staccato]] articulation and orchestrated in the most delicate and enchanting colours:[[File:Minor version of the theme.wav|thumb|Minor version of the theme]][[File:Minor version 1.png|thumb|center|500px|Minor version of the theme. ]]This is followed by a more straightforward version in the major key, with horns accompanied by strings.  The theme is now played [[legato]] by the horns, accompanied by a sustained [[pedal point]] in the bassoons.  The violins simultaneously play an elaborated version of the theme.  (See also [[heterophony]].)  The timpani and [[pizzicato]] lower strings add further colour to this variegated palette of sounds. “Considering that the notes are virtually the same the difference in effect is extraordinary”:&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, R.

(1970, p.42), ''Beethoven Concertos and Overtures''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berlioz===

The most significant orchestral innovator of the early 19th century was Hector [[Berlioz]].  (The composer was also the author of a ''[[Treatise on Instrumentation]]''.) “He was drawn to the orchestra as his chosen medium by instinct … and by finding out the exact capabilities and [[timbres]] of individual instruments, and it was on this raw material that his imagination worked to produce countless new sonorities, very striking when considered as a totality, crucially instructive for later composers, and nearly all exactly tailored to their dramatic or expressive purpose.” &lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, H. (1969, p5) ''Berlioz Orchestral Music''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous examples of Berlioz’s orchestral wizardry and his penchant for conjuring extraordinary sonorities can be found in his ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]''.  The opening of the fourth movement, entitled “March to the Scaffold” features what for the time (1830) must have seemed a bizarre mix of sounds.  The timpani and the double basses play thick chords against the snarling muted brass: [[File:March to the Scaffold bars 1-4.png|thumb|center|500px|Berlioz, March to the Scaffold from the Symphonie [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXHrHQ5ZEHo Fantastique. Listen]]]

“Although he derives from Beethoven, Berlioz uses features that run counter to the rules of composition in general, such as the chords in close position in the low register of the double basses.” &lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (203, p.44) Boulez on Conducting.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;
Berlioz was also capable of conveying great delicacy in his instrumental writing.  A particularly spectacular instance is the “[[Queen Mab]]” [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsf7Jmj7HM scherzo] from the ''[[Romeo et Juliette]]'' symphony, which [[Hugh Macdonald]] (1969, p51) describes as “Berlioz’s supreme exercise in light orchestral texture, a brilliant, gossamer fabric, [[prestissimo]] and [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]] almost without pause: [[File:Queen Mab main theme.png|thumb|center|500px|Berlioz, Queen Mab scherzo from Romeo et Juliette]]

Boulez points out that the very fast tempo must have made unprecedented demands on conductors and orchestras of the time (1830), “Because of the rapid and precise rhythms, the staccatos which must be even and regular in all registers, because of the isolated notes that occur right at the end of the bar on the third quaver…all of which must fall into place with absolutely perfect precision.” &lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (203, p.37) Boulez on Conducting.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;
Macdonald highlights the passage towards the end of the scherzo where “The sounds become more ethereal and fairylike, low clarinet, high harps and the bell-like antique cymbals…The pace and fascination of the movement are irresistible; it is some of the most ethereally brilliant music ever penned.” &lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, H. (1969, p51) Berlioz orchestral Music.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Queen mab scherzo p218.png|thumb|center|500px|Berlioz, orchestral texture from  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsf7Jmj7HM&amp;t=6m0s Queen Mab Scherzo. Listen]]] The [[New Grove Dictionary]] says that for Berlioz, orchestration “was intrinsic to composition, not something applied to finished music...in his hands [[timbre]] became something that could be used in free combinations, as an artist might use his palette, without bowing to the demands of line, and this leads to the rich orchestral resource of Debussy and Ravel.”&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, H., (2001) “Berlioz”, article in Sadie, S. (ed.) ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition.  London, MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wagner===

After Berlioz, [[Richard Wagner]] was the major pioneer in the development of orchestration during the 19th century.  [[Pierre Boulez]] speaks of the “sheer richness of Wagner’s orchestration and his irrepressible instinct for innovation.”&lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (1986, p273) Orientations.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Latham says that Wagner had a “unique appreciation of the possibilities for colour inherent in the instruments at his disposal, and it was this that guided him both in his selection of new recruits for the orchestral family and in his treatment of its established members. The well-known division of that family into strings, woodwind, and brass, with percussion as required, he inherited from the great classical symphonists such changes as he made were in the direction of splitting up these groups still further.” Latham gives as an example, the sonority of the opening of the opera ''[[Lohengrin]]'', where “the ethereal quality of the music” is due to the violins being “divided up into four, five, or even eight parts instead of the customary two.”&lt;ref&gt;Latham, P. (1926) “Wagner: Aesthetics and Orchestration.” Gramophone, June 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Prelude to Lohengrin condensed score.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Prelude to Lohengrin [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqk4bcnBqls Listen]]]

As he matured as a composer, particularly through his experience of composing [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|''The Ring'']] Wagner made “increasing use of the contrast between pure and mixed [[Timbre|colours]], bringing to a fine point the art of transition from one field of sonority to another.” &lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (1986, p273) Orientations.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first act of his final opera ''[[Parsifal]]'', Wagner offsets the bold brass with gentler strings, showing that the same musical material feels very different when passed between contrasting families of instruments:[[File:Parsifal contrasting groups.png|thumb|center|500px|Contrasting orchestral groups from the first Act of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04Q-dl2RYyA&amp;t=0m54s Parsifal]]]

On the other hand, the prelude to the opera ''[[Tristan and Isolde]]'' exemplifies the variety that Wagner could extract through combining instruments from different [[Orchestra|orchestral families]] with his precise markings of [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] and [[Articulation (music)|articulation]].  In the opening phrase, the cellos are supported by wind instruments: [[File:Tristan prelude bars 1-7.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Tristan prelude, opening. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-qoaioG2UA&amp;list=RDJ-qoaioG2UA Listen]]]

When this idea returns towards the end of the prelude, the [[Timbre|instrumental colors]] are varied subtly, with sounds that were new to the 19th century orchestra, such as the [[cor anglais]] and the [[bass clarinet]].  These, together with the ominous rumbling of the timpani effectively convey the brooding atmosphere: [[File:Wagner, Tristan prelude closing bars.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Tristan Prelude, closing bars. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-qoaioG2UA&amp;list=RDJ-qoaioG2UA&amp;t=9m45s Link to passage]]]

“It’s impressive to see how Wagner… produces balance in his works.  He is true genius in this respect, undeniably so, even down to the working out of the exact number of instruments.”  Boulez is “fascinated by the precision with which Wagner gauges orchestral balance, [which] … contains a multiplicity of details that he achieved with astonishing precision.”&lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (2003, p.52) Boulez on Conducting.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Roger Scruton]], "Seldom since Bach's inspired use of [[obbligato]] parts in his cantatas have the instruments of the orchestra been so meticulously and lovingly adapted to their expressive role by Wagner in his later operas." &lt;ref&gt;Scruton, R. (2016, p147) ''The Ring of Truth: The Wisdom of Wagner's'' Ring of the Nibelung.  Penguin Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahler===
William Austin (1966) says “[[Mahler]] expanded the orchestra, going ahead to a historic climax in the direction already marked by [[Beethoven]], [[Berlioz]] and [[Wagner]]… The purpose of this famous expansion was not a sheer increase in volume, but a greater variety of sound with more nearly continuous gradations… Mahler only occasionally required all his vast orchestra to play together, and his music was as often soft as loud.  Its colours were continually shifting, blending or contrasting with each other.”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p. 123) ''Music in the 20th Century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adorno]] (1971) similarly describes Mahler’s symphonic writing as characterised by “massive tutti effects” contrasted with “chamber-music procedures”.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T.W. (1971, p.53) ''Mahler, a musical physiognomy''.  Trans. Jephcott.  University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The following passage from the first movement of his Symphony No. 4 illustrates this:[[File:Mahler 4 1st movt Fig 5.wav|thumb|Mahler, Symphony No. 4, first movement, Fig 5]][[File:Mahler 4 1st movt Fig 5.png|thumb|center|500px|Mahler, Symphony No. 4, first movement, Figure 5. ]] Only in the first bar of the above is there a full ensemble.  The remaining bars feature highly differentiated small groups of instruments.  Mahler’s experienced conductor’s ear led him to write detailed performance markings in his scores, including carefully calibrated dynamics.  For example, in bar 2 above, the low harp note is marked [[Dynamics (music)|''forte'']], the clarinets, [[Dynamics (music)|''mezzo-forte'']] and the horns [[Dynamics (music)|''piano'']].  Austin (1966) says that “Mahler cared about the finest nuances of loudness and tempo and worked tirelessly to fix these details in his scores.”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p. 123) ''Music in the 20th Century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahler’s imagination for sonority is exemplified in the closing bars of the slow movement of the Fourth Symphony, where there occurs what [[Walter Piston]] (1969, p.&amp;nbsp;140) describes as “an instance of inspired orchestration… To be noted are the sudden change of mode in the harmonic progression, the unusual spacing of the chord in measure 5, and the placing of the perfect fourth in the two flutes. The effect is quite unexpected and magical.”&lt;ref&gt;Piston, W. (1969) ''Orchestration''.  London, Victor Gollancz.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Mahler 4 3rd movement Fig 13.wav|thumb|Mahler Symphony No 4, third movement, Figure 13.]][[File:Mahler 4 third movement.png|thumb|center|500px|Mahler Symphony No 4, third movement, Figure 13.]]

===Debussy===

Apart from Mahler and [[Richard Strauss]], the major innovator in orchestration during the closing years of the nineteenth and the first decades of the twentieth century was Claude [[Debussy]].  According to Pierre [[Boulez]] (1975, p20) “Debussy’s orchestration… when compared with even such brilliant contemporaries as Strauss and Mahler… shows an infinitely fresher imagination.”  Boulez said that Debussy’s orchestration was “conceived from quite a different point of view; the number of instruments, their balance, the order in which they are used, their use itself, produces a different climate.”  Apart from the early impact of [[Wagner]], Debussy was also fascinated by music from Asia that according to Austin “he heard repeatedly and admired intensely at the Paris World exhibition of 1889”.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p20) ''Music in the 20th century''. London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both influences inform Debussy’s first major orchestral work, ''[[Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune|Prelude a l’après-midi d’un faune]]'' (1894).  Wagner’s influence can be heard in the strategic use of [[silence]], the sensitively differentiated orchestration and, above all in the striking [[half-diminished seventh]] chord spread between oboes and clarinets, reinforced by a [[glissando]] on the harp. Austin (1966, p.&amp;nbsp;16) continues “Only a composer thoroughly familiar with the [[Tristan chord]] could have conceived the beginning of the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYyK922PsUw ''Faune''].”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p.16) ''Music in the 20th century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Prelude a l'apres midi opening.png|thumb|center|600px|Debussy, Prelude a l'apres midi d'un faune, opening bars]]

Later in the ''Faune'', Debussy builds a complex texture, where, as Austin says, “[[Polyphony]] and orchestration overlap...He adds to all the devices of [[Mozart]], [[Weber]], [[Berlioz]] and Wagner the possibilities that he learned from the [[heterophonic]] music of the Far East.... The first harp varies the flute parts in almost the same way that the smallest bells of a [[Java]]nese [[gamelan]] vary the slower basic melody.”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p.20) ''Music in the 20th century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Prelude a l'apres midi, from Fig 7- short score version.png|thumb|center|700px|Debussy, Prelude a l'apres midi d'un faune, Figure 7, bars 11-13]]

Debussy’s final orchestral work, the enigmatic ballet ''[[Jeux]]'' (1913) was composed nearly 20 years after the ''Faune''.  The opening bars feature divided strings, spread over a wide range, a harp doubling horns with the addition of the bell-like [[celesta]] in the 5th bar and the sultry voicing of the [[whole tone scale|whole tone]] chords in the woodwind:[[File:Jeux opening bars.png|thumb|center|500px|Debussy, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8qP_2i3HYA Jeux opening bars]]]

Jensen (2014, p.&amp;nbsp;228) says “Perhaps the greatest marvel of ''Jeux'' is its orchestration.  While working on the piano score, Debussy wrote: ‘I am thinking of that orchestral colour which seems to be illuminated from behind, and for which there are such marvellous displays in ''[[Parsifal]]''’  The idea, then, was to produce timbre without glare, subdued… but to do so with clarity and precision.” &lt;ref&gt;Jensen, E.F. (2014) ''Debussy''.  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As adaptation==
In a more general sense, ''orchestration'' also refers to the re-adaptation of existing music into another medium, particularly a full or reduced orchestra. There are two general kinds of adaptation: [[Transcription (music)|transcription]], which closely follows the original piece,  and [[arrangement]], which tends to change significant aspects of the original piece. In terms of adaptation, ''orchestration'' applies, strictly speaking, only to writing for orchestra, whereas the term ''[[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]]'' applies to instruments used in the texture of the piece. In the study of orchestration&amp;nbsp;– in contradistinction to the practice&amp;nbsp;– the term ''instrumentation'' may also refer to consideration of the defining characteristics of individual instruments rather than to the art of combining instruments.

In commercial music, especially musical theatre and film music, independent orchestrators are often used because it is difficult to meet tight deadlines when the same person is required both to compose and to orchestrate. Frequently, when a stage musical is adapted to film, such as ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' or ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'', the orchestrations for the film version are notably different from the stage ones. In other cases, such as ''[[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]]'', they are not, and are simply expanded versions from those used in the stage production.

Most orchestrators often work from a draft (sketch), or [[Sheet music#Types|short score]], that is, a score written on limited number of independent [[musical staff|musical staves]]. Some orchestrators, particularly those writing for the [[opera]] or [[music theatre]]s, prefer to work from a piano [[vocal score]] up, since the singers need to start rehearsing a piece long before the whole work is fully completed. That was, for instance, the method of composition of [[Jules Massenet]]. In other instances, simple cooperation between various creators is utilized, as when [[Jonathan Tunick]] orchestrates [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s songs, or when orchestration is done from a [[lead sheet]] (a simplified music notation for a song which includes just the melody and the [[chord progression]]). In the latter case, arranging as well as orchestration will be involved.

==Film orchestration==
Due to the enormous time constraints of film scoring schedules, most film composers employ orchestrators rather than doing the work themselves, although these orchestrators work under the close supervision of the composer. Some [[Film score|film composers]] have made the time to orchestrate their own music, including [[Bernard Herrmann]] (1911-1975), [[Georges Delerue]] (1925-1992), [[Ennio Morricone]] (1928-), [[John Williams]] (1932-) (his very detailed sketches are 99% orchestrated), [[Howard Shore]] (1946-), [[James Horner]] (1953-2015) (on Braveheart), [[Bruno Coulais]] (1954-), [[Rachel Portman]] (1960-), [[Philippe Rombi]] (1968-) and [[Abel Korzeniowski]] (1972-).

Although there have been hundreds of orchestrators in film over the years, the most prominent film orchestrators for the latter half of the 20th century were [[Jack Hayes (composer)|Jack Hayes]], [[Herbert W. Spencer]], [[Edward B. Powell (orchestrator)|Edward Powell]] (who worked almost exclusively with [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]]), [[Arthur Morton (composer)|Arthur Morton]], Greig McRitchie, and [[Alexander Courage]].  Some of the most in-demand orchestrators today (and of the past 30 years) include [[Jeff Atmajian]], [[Pete Anthony]], [[Brad Dechter]] (James Newton Howard, Christopher Young, Theodore Shapiro, Teddy Castellucci, Danny Elfman, John Powell, Marco Beltrami, John Debney, Marc Shaiman, Michael Giacchino), [[Conrad Pope]] (John Williams, Alexandre Desplat, Jerry Goldsmith, James Newton Howard, Alan Silvestri, James Horner, Mark Isham, John Powell, Michael Convertino, Danny Elfman, Howard Shore), [[Eddie Karam]] (John Williams, James Horner), [[Bruce Fowler]] (Hans Zimmer, Klaus Badelt, Harry Gregson-Williams, Steve Jablonsky, Mark Mothersbaugh, John Powell), [[John Ashton Thomas]] (John Powell, John Debney, Alan Silvestri, James Newton Howard, Henry Jackman, Lyle Workman, Theodore Shapiro, John Ottman, John Paesano), [[Robert Elhai]] (Elliot Goldenthal, Michael Kamen, Ed Shearmur, Brian Tyler, Klaus Badelt, Ilan Eshkeri ) and [[J.A.C. Redford]] (James Horner, Thomas Newman). 

[[Conrad Salinger]] was the most prominent orchestrator of MGM musicals from the 1940s to 1962, orchestrating such famous films as ''[[Singin' in the Rain (film)|Singin' in the Rain]]'', ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'', and ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]''. In the 1950s, film composer [[John Williams]] frequently spent time with Salinger informally learning the craft of orchestration. [[Robert Russell Bennett]] (George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hammerstein) was one of America's most prolific orchestrators (particularly of Broadway shows) of the 20th century, sometimes scoring over 80 pages a day.

===Process===
Most films require 30 to 120 minutes of musical score. Each individual piece of music in a film is called a "cue". There are roughly 20-80 cues per film. A dramatic film may require slow and sparse music while an action film may require 80 cues of highly active music. Each cue can range in length from five seconds to more than ten minutes as needed per scene in the film. After the composer is finished composing the cue, this sketch score is delivered to the orchestrator either as hand written or computer generated. Most composers in Hollywood today compose their music using sequencing software (e.g. [[Digital Performer]], [[Logic Pro]], or [[Cubase]]). A sketch score can be generated through the use of a [[MIDI]] file which is then imported into a [[scorewriter|music notation program]] such as [[Finale (software)|Finale]] or [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]]. Thus begins the job of the orchestrator.

Every composer works differently and the orchestrator's job is to understand what is required from one composer to the next. If the music is created with sequencing software then the orchestrator is given a MIDI sketch score and a synthesized recording of the cue. The sketch score only contains the musical notes (e.g. eighth notes, quarter notes, etc.) with no phrasing, articulations, or dynamics. The orchestrator studies this synthesized "mockup" recording listening to dynamics and phrasing (just as the composer has played them in).  He or she then accurately tries to represent these elements in the orchestra. However some voicings on a synthesizer ([[synthestration]]) will not work in the same way when orchestrated for the live orchestra.

The sound samples are often doubled up very prominently and thickly with other sounds in order to get the music to "speak" louder. The orchestrator sometimes changes these synth voicings to traditional orchestral voicings in order to make the music flow better. He or she may move intervals up or down the octave (or omit them entirely), double certain passages with other instruments in the orchestra, add percussion instruments to provide colour, and add Italian performance marks (e.g. Allegro con brio, Adagio, ritardando, dolce, staccato, etc.). If a composer writes a large action cue, and no woodwinds are used, the orchestrator will often add woodwinds by doubling the brass music up an octave. The orchestra size is determined from the music budget of the film.

The orchestrator is told in advance the number of instruments he or she has to work with and has to abide by what is available. A big-budget film may be able to afford a [[Romantic music era]]-orchestra with over 100 musicians. In contrast, a low-budget [[independent film]] may only be able to afford a 20 performer [[chamber orchestra]] or a [[jazz quartet]]. Sometimes a composer will write a three-part chord for three flutes, although only two flutes have been hired. The orchestrator decides where to put the third note. For example, the orchestrator could have the clarinet (a woodwind that blends well with flute) play the third note. After the orchestrated cue is complete it is delivered to the copying house (generally by placing it on a computer server) so that each instrument of the orchestra can be electronically extracted, printed, and delivered to the scoring stage.

The major film composers in Hollywood each have a lead orchestrator. Generally the lead orchestrator attempts to orchestrate as much of the music as possible if time allows. If the schedule is too demanding, a team of orchestrators (ranging from two to eight) will work on a film. The lead orchestrator decides on the assignment of cues to other orchestrators on the team. Most films can be orchestrated in one to two weeks with a team of five orchestrators. New orchestrators trying to obtain work will often approach a film composer asking to be hired. They are generally referred to the lead orchestrator for consideration. At the scoring stage the orchestrator will often assist the composer in the recording booth giving suggestions on how to improve the performance, the music, or the recording. If the composer is conducting, sometimes the orchestrator will remain in the recording booth to assist as a producer. Sometimes the roles are reversed with the orchestrator [[conducting]] and the composer producing from the booth.

[[Viscount]] '''Philippe de Tarrazi''' ({{lang-ar|فيليب دي طرّازي}} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''Fīlīb dī Ṭarrāzī''; 28 April 1865 – 7 August 1956), was a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[polymath]], [[philanthropist]], founder of the [[National Library of Lebanon]] and a founding member of the [[Arab Academy of Damascus]].

== Life ==
Philippe was born in Beirut to a renowned [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Catholic]] merchant family which had recently emigrated from [[Aleppo]]. His father was given the honorary title [[viscount]] by [[Pope Leo XIII]], which he later held. He studied at the patriarchal school and later the [[Collège Notre Dame de Jamhour|Jesuit College]]. Philippe showed interest in the [[Syriac literature|Syriac]], [[Arabic literature|Arabic]] and [[French literature|French]] literatures, and authored at least 57 books on these, of which only 25 were published.

De Tarrazi helped victims of the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name="Gorgias"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gorgiaspress.com/bookshop/pc-55975-16-de-tarrazi-philip-catalogue-of-eastern-and-western-arabic-libraries.aspx | title=de Tarrazi, Philip.

De Tarrazi was an avid collector of books and publications. His library included an extensive collection of publication from the Near East.

==Legacy==
The [[Lebanese National Library]] was established in 1921, with a donation from Viscount de Tarrazi of twenty thousand books, many rare manuscripts, and the first issues of newspapers from the [[Near East]].&lt;ref name="Manguel p302"&gt;{{citation |title=The Library at Night |last=Manguel |first=Alberto |authorlink=Alberto Manguel |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven &amp; London |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-300-13914-3 |page=302}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  De Tarazi's instructions were that his donation should form "the core of what should become the Great Library of [[Beirut|Beyrouth]]."&lt;ref name="Manguel p302" /&gt;  It was placed under the supervision of the Ministry of National Education in 1922.&lt;ref name="Wedgeworth p452"&gt;{{citation |title=World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services |last=Wedgeworth |first=Robert |publisher=[[American Library Association|ALA Editions]] |year=1993 |isbn=0-8389-0609-5 |page=452}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It moved to the [[Parliament of Lebanon#The building|Lebanese Parliament building]] in 1937.&lt;ref name="Wedgeworth p452" /&gt;

'''Plant perception''' or '''biocommunication''' is the [[paranormal]] idea that [[plant]]s are [[Sentience|sentient]], that they respond to humans in a manner that amounts to [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], and that they experience [[suffering|pain]] and fear. The idea is not accepted, as plants lack [[nervous systems]].&lt;ref name="Galston 1981"&gt;Galston, Arthur W; Slayman, Clifford L. ''Plant Sensitivity and Sensation''.

Cambridge University Press. p. 2. {{ISBN|0-521-82142-8}} "Plants do not have a nervous system and certainly do not make conscious decisions about what to do next."&lt;/ref&gt; Paranormal claims in regard to plant perception are considered to be [[pseudoscience]] by many in the [[scientific community]].&lt;ref name="Galston 1981"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skepdic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Leslie Audus|Audus, Leslie]]. (1974). ''Roots of Absurdity''. ''[[New Scientist]]''. 17 October. p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Galston 1979"&gt;Galston, Arthur W; Slayman, Clifford L. (1979). ''The Not-So-Secret Life of Plants: In Which the Historical and Experimental Myths About Emotional Communication Between Animal and Vegetable Are Put to Rest''. ''[[American Scientist]]'' 67 (3): 337-344.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is distinct from measured [[Plant perception (physiology)|plant perception]] and chemical communication.

==Early research==
The notion that plants are capable of feeling emotions was first recorded in 1848, when [[Gustav Fechner]], a German [[experimental psychologist]], suggested that plants are capable of emotions and that one could promote healthy growth with talk, attention, attitude, and affection.&lt;ref&gt;Heidelberger, Michael. (2004). ''Nature From Within: Gustav Theodor Fechner and his Psychophysical Worldview''. University of Pittsburgh Press. p. 54. {{ISBN|0-8229-4210-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian scientist [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]], began to conduct experiments on plants in the year 1900. Bose invented various devices and instruments to measure electrical responses in plants.&lt;ref name="Galston 1979"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. A Shepard cited in Alexander Volkov. (2012). ''Plant Electrophysiology: Methods and Cell Electrophysiology''. Springer. p. 12. {{ISBN|978-3-642-29119-7}} "Bose began by applying delicate instrumentation he had invented in his semiconductor research to deliver electrical stimuli and record electrical responses from various plant parts... He discovered that both living animal and plant tissues exhibited a diminution of sensitivity after continuous stimulation, recovery after rest, a 'staircase' or summation of electrical effects following mechanical stimulation, abolition of current flow after applying poisons and reduced sensitivity at low temperature."&lt;/ref&gt; He stated from his experiments that an electrical spasm occurs during the end of life for a plant.&lt;ref&gt;Biswal, Basanti; Krupinska, Karin; Biswal, Udaya C. (2013). ''Plastid Development in Leaves During Growth and Senescence''. Springer. p. 303. {{ISBN|978-94-007-5723-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to biologist [[Patrick Geddes]] "In his investigations on response in general Bose had found that even ordinary plants and their different organs were sensitive— exhibiting, under mechanical or other stimuli, an electric response, indicative of excitation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Geddes|Geddes, Patrick]]. (1920). [https://archive.org/stream/sirjagadisbose00geddrich#page/120/mode/2up ''The Life and Work of Sir Jagadis C. Bose'']. Longmans, Green &amp; Company. p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; One visitor to his laboratory, the [[vegetarian]] playwright [[George Bernard Shaw]], was intensely disturbed upon witnessing a demonstration in which a [[cabbage]] had "convulsions" as it boiled to death.&lt;ref&gt;

==Cleve Backster==
In the 1960s [[Cleve Backster]], an [[interrogation]] specialist with the CIA, conducted research that led him to believe that plants can communicate with other lifeforms. Backster's interest in the subject began in February 1966 when he tried to measure the rate at which water rises from a [[philodendron]]'s root into its leaves. Because a [[polygraph]] or 'lie detector' can measure electrical resistance, which would alter when the plant was watered, he attached a polygraph to one of the plant's leaves. Backster stated that, to his immense surprise, "the tracing began to show a pattern typical of the response you get when you subject a [[human]] to emotional stimulation of short duration".&lt;ref&gt;[[Cleve Backster|Backster, Cleve]]. (2003). ''Primary Perception: Biocommunication with Plants, Living Foods, and Human Cells''. White Rose Millennium Press. {{ISBN|978-0966435436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, K. A. Horowitz, D. C. Lewis and E. L. Gasteiger published an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' giving their results when repeating one of Backster's effects - plant response to the killing of [[brine shrimp]] in boiling water. The researchers grounded the plants to reduce electrical interference and rinsed them to remove dust particles. As a control three of five pipettes contained brine shrimp while the remaining two only had water: the pipettes were delivered to the boiling water at random. This investigation used a total of 60 brine shrimp deliveries to boiling water while Backster's had used 13. Positive correlations did not occur at a rate great enough to be considered statistically significant.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, K. A., Lewis, D. C, and Gasteiger, E. L. (1975). ''Plant Primary Perception: Electrophysiological Unresponsiveness to Brine Shrimp Killing''. ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' 189: 478-480.&lt;/ref&gt; Other controlled experiments that attempted to replicate Backster's findings have also produced negative results.&lt;ref name="Galston 1981"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwebs, Ursula. (1973). ''Do Plants Have Feelings?'' ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers]]''. pp. 75-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chedd, Graham. (1975). ''AAAS takes on Emotional Plants''. ''[[New Scientist]]''. 13 February. pp. 400-401&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neher, Andrew. (2011). ''Paranormal and Transcendental Experience: A Psychological Examination''. Dover Publications. pp. 155-156. {{ISBN|978-0486261676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanist [[Arthur Galston]] and [[Physiology|physiologist]] Clifford L. Slayman who investigated Backster's claims wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no objective scientific evidence for the existence of such complex behaviour in plants. The recent spate of popular literature on "plant consciousness" appears to have been triggered by "experiments" with a lie detector, subsequently reported and embellished in a book called ''[[The Secret Life of Plants]]''. Unfortunately, when scientists in the discipline of plant physiology attempted to repeat the experiments, using either identical or improved equipment, the results were uniformly negative. Further investigation has shown that the original observations probably arose from defective measuring procedures.&lt;ref name="Galston 1981"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John M. Kmetz noted that Backster had not used proper controls in his experiments. When controls were used, no plant reactions to thoughts or threats were observed.&lt;ref&gt;Kmetz, John M. (1978). ''Plant Primary Perception: The Other Side of the Leaf''. ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' 2 (2): 57-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''MythBusters''==

The television show ''[[MythBusters]]'' performed [[MythBusters (2006 season)#Primary Perception|experiments]] (Season 4, Episode 18, 2006) to verify or disprove the concept. The tests involved connecting plants to a polygraph [[galvanometer]] and employing actual and imagined harm upon the plants or upon others in the plants' vicinity. The galvanometer showed some kind of reaction about one third of the time. The experimenters, who were in the room with the plant, posited that the vibrations of their actions or the room itself could have affected the polygraph. After isolating the plant, the polygraph showed a response slightly less than one third of the time. Later experiments with an [[EEG]] failed to detect anything. The show concluded that the results were not repeatable, and that the theory was not true.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Pyu Inscription.JPG|thumb|A Pyu inscription from Hanlin Archeological Museum, Burma]]
The '''Pyu script''' is a writing system used to write the [[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu language]], an extinct [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language]] that was mainly spoken in present-day central [[Burma]]. It was based on the [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]]-based scripts of both north and south India. The best available evidence suggests that the Pyu script gradually developed between the 2nd and 6th centuries CE. The Pyu script's immediate precursor appears to be the [[Kadamba script]] of southwest India. The early period Pyu inscriptions always included interlinear Brahmi scripts. It was not until the 7th and 8th centuries that Sri Ksetra's inscriptions appeared all in the Pyu script, without any interlinear Brahmi.&lt;ref name=mat-35-36&gt;Aung-Thwin, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the important inscriptions were written in Sanskrit and Pali, alongside the Pyu script. The Pyu sites have yielded a wide variety of Indian scripts from King [[Ashoka]]'s edicts written in north Indian Brahmi and Tamil [[Sangam literature]], both dated to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, to the [[Gupta script]] and [[Kannada script]] dated to the 4th to 6th centuries CE.&lt;ref name=mat-35-36/&gt;&lt;ref name=geh-4&gt;Harvey, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pyu script is presently not in [[Unicode]]. Its inclusion was proposed in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2010/10295-pyu-chart.pdf|title=Preliminary Code Chart and Names List for the Pyu Script|last=Pandey|first=Anshuman|date=5 August 2010|publisher=Unicode Consortium|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has tentative placement in the Unicode Consortium's roadmap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/|title=Roadmap to the SMP|authors=Michael Everson, Rick McGowan, Ken Whistler, V.S.

'''Salvadoran Sign language''' is a language used by the [[Deaf culture|deaf community]] in [[El Salvador]]. Its main purpose is to provide education. There are three distinct forms of [[sign language]]. [[American Sign Language]] was brought over to El Salvador from the [[United States]] by missionaries who set up small communal schools for the deaf. The government has also created a school for the deaf, teaching by means of their own modified Salvadoran Sign Language. The third type of sign language used is a combination of American Sign Language and Salvadoran Sign language. Most deaf understand and rely upon both. Their own unique Salvidoran Sign language is based on their language and is most useful in regular encounters; however, American Sign Language is often relied on within education due to the larger and more specific vocabulary. This is the reason that the deaf community within El Salvador sometimes relies upon both ASL and SSL in a combined form.

== Education ==
There is a formal school for the deaf run by the government. About every five years, government-hired teachers make their rounds to all the villages and small communities offering to care for and educate the deaf children. The parents may choose to not send their deaf children away, but then the children risk receiving little to no education.

==Classification==
Henri Wittmann&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Wittmann|Wittmann, Henri]] (1991).  "Classification linguistique des langues signées non vocalement." Revue québécoise de linguistique théorique et appliquée 10:1.215–88.[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1991a-class.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; posits that SSL is a language isolate (a 'prototype' sign language), though one developed through [[stimulus diffusion]] from an existing sign language, likely [[French Sign Language]].  SSL is reported to have signs in common with [[Colombian Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{e18|csn|Colombian Sign Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[law]], '''selective [[enforcement]]''' occurs when government [[official]]s such as [[police officer]]s, [[prosecutor]]s, or [[regulatory agency|regulators]] exercise [[Discretion#In_law|'''enforcement discretion''']], which is the power to choose whether or how to punish a person who has violated the law. The [[bias]]ed use of enforcement discretion, such as that based on [[racial prejudice]] or [[corruption]], is usually considered a [[legal abuse]] and a threat to the [[rule of law]].

In some cases, selective enforcement may be desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cane|first1=Peter|title=Responsibility in Law and Morality|date=2002|publisher=Hart|page=239|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S8bO6bsMOc4C&amp;pg=PA239&amp;dq=selective+enforcement+may+be+desirable&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQv4DooafMAhVFcj4KHTbyA24Q6AEINTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=selective%20enforcement%20may%20be%20desirable&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a verbal warning to a teenager may effectively alter their behavior without resorting to legal punishment and with the added benefit of reducing governmental legal costs.  In other cases, selective enforcement may be inevitable. For example, it may be impractical for police officers to issue [[traffic ticket]]s to every driver they observe exceeding the speed limit, so they may have no choice but to limit action to the most flagrant examples of reckless driving.

== United States law ==
In the United States federal system, the [[prosecutor]] has wide latitude in determining when, who, how, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of federal criminal law. The prosecutor's broad discretion in such areas as initiating or forgoing prosecutions, selecting or recommending specific charges, and terminating prosecutions by accepting guilty pleas has been recognized on numerous occasions by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oyler v.

[...] This broad discretion rests largely on the recognition that the decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review. Such factors as the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence value, the Government's enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to the Government's overall enforcement plan are not readily susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts are competent to undertake.&lt;/blockquote&gt;''[[Yick Wo v.

==Immigration law==
More recently this has become a topic of great discussion in the illegal immigration debate in the [[United States]].  The [[Priority Enforcement Program#2011 Morton memo|2011 "Morton Memo"]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ice.gov/doclib/secure-communities/pdf/prosecutorial-discretion-memo.pdf Morton Memo]&lt;/ref&gt; laid out enforcement priorities for the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]], and was intended to channel limited resources into prioritized pursuit of cases involving criminals and felons.  It was interpreted as the waiver of active prosecution of non-criminal illegal aliens and the exclusive focus on criminal illegal aliens.  Enforcement priorities were further defined by the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] program, which started in 2012.  This uses the executive branch's discretionary authority to grant certain people who were illegally brought to the United States as minors the temporary authorization to live and work in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15366">'''Speech segmentation''' is the process of identifying the boundaries between [[word]]s, [[syllable]]s, or [[phoneme]]s in spoken [[natural language]]s. The term applies both to the [[human mind|mental]] processes used by humans, and to artificial processes of [[natural language processing]].

Speech segmentation is a subfield of general [[speech perception]] and an important subproblem of the technologically focused field of [[speech recognition]], and cannot be adequately solved in isolation. As in most [[natural language processing]] problems, one must take into account [[wiktionary:context|context]], [[grammar]], and [[semantics]], and even so the result is often a [[probability|probabilistic]] division (statistically based on likelihood) rather than a categorical one. Though it seems that [[coarticulation]]—a phenomenon which may happen between adjacent words just as easily as within a single word—presents the main challenge in speech segmentation across languages, some other problems and strategies employed in solving those problems can be seen in the following sections.

This problem overlaps to some extent with the problem of [[text segmentation]] that occurs in some languages which are traditionally written without inter-word spaces, like [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], compared to [[writing system]]s which indicate speech segmentation between words by a [[word divider]], such as the [[space (punctuation)|space]]. However, even for those languages, text segmentation is often much easier than speech segmentation, because the written language usually has little interference between adjacent words, and often contains additional clues not present in speech (such as the use of [[kanji|Chinese characters]] for word stems in Japanese). Word Boundary Identification can be overcome by [[Natural language understanding|NLU]] approaches such as [http://www.isi.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Oeffentliche_Medien/Fakultaeten/Philosophische_Fakultaet/Sprache_und_Information/Ball_PatomTheory.pdf Patom theory] integrated with [http://linguistics.buffalo.edu/people/faculty/vanvalin/rrg.html Role and Reference Grammar] (RRG) for languages without spaces between words such as Japanese and Chinese.

==Lexical recognition==

In natural languages, the meaning of a complex spoken sentence can be understood by decomposing it into smaller lexical segments (roughly, the words of the language), associating a meaning to each segment, and combining those meanings according to the grammar rules of the language.

Though lexical recognition is not thought to be used by infants in their first year, due to their highly limited vocabularies, it is one of the major processes involved in speech segmentation for adults. Three main models of lexical recognition exist in current research: first, whole-word access, which argues that words have a whole-word representation in the lexicon; second, decomposition, which argues that morphologically complex words are broken down into their [[morpheme]]s ([[root (linguistics)|roots]], [[Word stem|stems]], [[inflection]]s, etc.) and then interpreted and; third, the view that whole-word and decomposition models are both used, but that the whole-word model provides some computational advantages and is therefore dominant in lexical recognition.&lt;ref name="Badecker &amp; Allen"&gt;Badecker, William and Mark Allen. [http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0749596X01928384/1-s2.0-S0749596X01928384-main.pdf?_tid=34f5485c-cce3-11e3-9892-00000aacb360&amp;acdnat=1398476377_6457ad093e3bb91d019580f52c8b534a "Morphological Parsing and the Perception of Lexical Identity: A Masked Priming Study of Stem Homographs"]. ''Journal of Memory and Language'' 47.1 (2002): 125–144. Retrieved 27 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

To give an example, in a whole-word model, the word "cats" might be stored and searched for by letter, first "c", then "ca", "cat", and finally "cats". The same word, in a decompositional model, would likely be stored under the root word "cat" and could be searched for after removing the "s" suffix. "Falling", similarly, would be stored as "fall" and suffixed with the "ing" inflection.&lt;ref&gt;Taft, Marcus and Kenneth I. Forster. [http://ac.els-cdn.com/0022537176900542/1-s2.0-0022537176900542-main.pdf?_tid=319f4dd8-cce3-11e3-a272-00000aacb35e&amp;acdnat=1398476371_d29fba92de07b4594904df529dae470e "Lexical Storage and Retrieval of Polymorphemic and Polysyllabic Words"]. ''Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior'' 15.6 (1976): 607–620. Retrieved 27 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though proponents of the decompositional model recognize that a morpheme-by-morpheme analysis may require significantly more computation, they argue that the unpacking of morphological information is necessary for other processes (such as [[syntactic structure]]) which may occur parallel to lexical searches.

As a whole, research into systems of human lexical recognition is limited due to little experimental evidence that fully discriminates between the three main models.&lt;ref name="Badecker &amp; Allen" /&gt;

In any case, lexical recognition likely contributes significantly to speech segmentation through the contextual clues it provides, given that it is a heavily probabilistic system—based on the statistical likelihood of certain words or constituents occurring together. For example, one can imagine a situation where a person might say "I bought my dog at a ____ shop" and the missing word's vowel is pronounced as in "net", "sweat", or "pet". While the probability of "netshop" is extremely low, since "netshop" isn't currently a compound or phrase in English, and "sweatshop" also seems contextually improbable, "pet shop" is a good fit because it is a common phrase and is also related to the word "dog".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=January 9–12, 2005 |last=Lieberman |first=Henry |author2=Alexander Faaborg |author3=Waseem Daher |author4=José Espinosa |title=How to Wreck a Nice Beach You Sing Calm Incense |publisher=MIT Media Library |url=http://web.media.mit.edu/~lieber/Publications/Wreck-a-Nice-Beach.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, an utterance can have different meanings depending on how it is split into words. A popular example, often quoted in the field, is the phrase "How to wreck a nice beach", which sounds very similar to "How to recognize speech". As this example shows, proper lexical segmentation depends on context and [[semantics]] which draws on the whole of human knowledge and experience, and would thus require advanced pattern recognition and [[artificial intelligence]] technologies to be implemented on a computer.

Lexical recognition is of particular value in the field of computer [[speech recognition]], since the ability to build and search a network of semantically connected ideas would greatly increase the effectiveness of speech-recognition software. Statistical models can be used to segment and align recorded speech to words or phones. Applications include automatic lip-synch timing for cartoon animation, follow-the-bouncing-ball video sub-titling, and linguistic research. Automatic segmentation and alignment software is commercially available.

==Phonotactic cues==

For most spoken languages, the boundaries between lexical units are difficult to identify; [[phonotactics]] are one answer to this issue. One might expect that the inter-word spaces used by many written languages like English or Spanish would correspond to pauses in their spoken version, but that is true only in very slow speech, when the speaker deliberately inserts those pauses. In normal speech, one typically finds many consecutive words being said with no pauses between them, and often the final sounds of one word blend smoothly or fuse with the initial sounds of the next word.

The notion that speech is produced like writing, as a sequence of distinct vowels and consonants, may be a relic of alphabetic heritage for some language communities. In fact, the way vowels are produced depends on the surrounding consonants just as consonants are affected by surrounding vowels; this is called [[coarticulation]]. For example, in the word "kit", the [k] is farther forward than when we say 'caught'. But also, the vowel in "kick" is phonetically different from the vowel in "kit", though we normally do not hear this. In addition, there are language-specific changes which occur in casual speech which makes it quite different from spelling. For example, in English, the phrase "hit you" could often be more appropriately spelled "hitcha".

From a decompositional perspective, in many cases, phonotactics play a part in letting speakers know where to draw word boundaries. In English, the word "strawberry" is perceived by speakers as consisting (phonetically) of two parts: "straw" and "berry". Other interpretations such as "stra" and "wberry" are inhibited by English phonotactics, which does not allow the cluster "wb" word-initially. Other such examples are "day/dream" and "mile/stone" which are unlikely to be interpreted as "da/ydream" or "mil/estone" due to the phonotactic probability or improbability of certain clusters. The sentence "Five women left", which could be phonetically transcribed as [faɪvwɪmɘnlɛft], is marked since neither /vw/ in /faɪvwɪmɘn/ or /nl/ in /wɪmɘnlɛft/ are allowed as syllable [[Syllable#Onset|onset]]s or [[Syllable#Coda|coda]]s in English phonotactics. These phonotactic cues often allow speakers to easily distinguish the boundaries in words.

Vowel harmony in languages like Finnish can also serve to provide phonotactic cues. While the system does not allow front vowels and back vowels to exist together within one morpheme, compounds allow two morphemes to maintain their own vowel harmony while coexisting in a word. Therefore, in compounds such as "selkä/ongelma" ('back problem') where [[vowel harmony]] is distinct between two [[constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] in a compound, the boundary will be wherever the switch in harmony takes place—between the "ä" and the "ö" in this case.&lt;ref&gt;Bertram, Raymond; Alexander Pollatsek; and Jukka Hyönä. [http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0749596X0400066X/1-s2.0-S0749596X0400066X-main.pdf?_tid=37ab8804-cce3-11e3-aa68-00000aacb35d&amp;acdnat=1398476381_fa7169a2e4a5d02fb148645a8cf1c0d5 "Morphological Parsing and the Use of Segmentation Cues in Reading Finnish Compounds"]. ''Journal of Memory and Language'' 51.3 (2004): 325–345. Retrieved 27 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, there are instances where phonotactics may not aid in segmentation. Words with unclear clusters or uncontrasted vowel harmony as in "opinto/uudistus" ('student reform') do not offer phonotactic clues as to how they are segmented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=General Introduction |url=http://www.lotpublications.nl/publish/articles/004413/bookpart.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427182052/http://www.lotpublications.nl/publish/articles/004413/bookpart.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=May 2017|reason=Author, date, title, academic institution, page number; this is really a cite thesis }}

From the perspective of the whole-word model, however, these words are thought be stored as full words, so the constituent parts wouldn't necessarily be relevant to lexical recognition.

==Speech segmentation in infants and non-natives==

Infants are one major focus of research in speech segmentation. Since infants have not yet acquired a lexicon capable of providing extensive contextual clues or probability-based word searches within their first year, as mentioned above, they must often rely primarily upon phonotactic and rhythmic cues (with [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] being the dominant cue), all of which are language-specific. Between 6 and 9 months, infants begin to lose the ability to discriminate between sounds not present in their native language and grow sensitive to the sound structure of their native language, with the word segmentation abilities appearing around 7.5 months.

Though much more research needs to be done on the exact processes that infants use to begin speech segmentation, current and past studies suggest that English-native infants approach stressed syllables as the beginning of words. At 7.5 months, infants appear to be able to segment bisyllabic words with strong-weak [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] patterns, though weak-strong stress patterns are often misinterpreted, e.g. interpreting "guiTAR is" as "GUI TARis". It seems that infants also show some complexity in tracking frequency and probability of words, for instance, recognizing that although the syllables "the" and "dog" occur together frequently, "the" also commonly occurs with other syllables, which may lead to the analysis that "dog" is an individual word or concept instead of the interpretation "thedog".&lt;ref&gt;Jusczyk, Peter W. and Derek M. Houston. [http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0010028599907168/1-s2.0-S0010028599907168-main.pdf?_tid=dbd9849e-ccf7-11e3-86b0-00000aacb35e&amp;acdnat=1398485246_976ee0593069e43014f2e202dbb97cc3 "The Beginnings of Word Segmentation in English-Learning Infants"].

[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0749596X00927554/1-s2.0-S0749596X00927554-main.pdf?_tid=e0f27d32-ccf7-11e3-b9e6-00000aacb360&amp;acdnat=1398485255_19ff5a8ebf7a7b0dad19cd51e06377c0 "Word Segmentation by 8-Month-Olds: When Speech Cues Count More Than Statistics"]. ''Journal of Memory and Language'' 44 (2001): 548–567. Retrieved 27 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language learners are another set of individuals being researched within speech segmentation. In some ways, learning to segment speech may be more difficult for a second-language learner than for an infant, not only in the lack of familiarity with sound probabilities and restrictions but particularly in the overapplication of the native language's patterns. While some patterns may occur between languages, as in the syllabic segmentation of French and English, they may not work well with languages such as Japanese, which has a [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]-based segmentation system. Further, phonotactic restrictions like the boundary-marking cluster /ld/ in German or Dutch are permitted (without necessarily marking boundaries) in English. Even the relationship between stress and [[vowel length]], which may seem intuitive to speakers of English, may not exist in other languages, so second-language learners face an especially great challenge when learning a language and its segmentation cues.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, Michael D. and Anne Cutler.

'''Thavưng''' or '''Aheu''' is a language spoken by the [[Phon Sung people]] in [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]]. There are thought to be some 1,770 speakers in Laos, largely concentrated in [[Khamkeut District]].  A further 750 speakers live in 3 villages of [[Song Dao District]], [[Sakon Nakhon Province]], Thailand, namely Ban Nong Waeng (in Pathum Wapi Subdistrict), Ban Nong Charoen, and Ban Nong Muang  &lt;ref name= Premsrirat &gt;Suwilai Premsrirat (1996). [http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/suwilai1996phonological.pdf Phonological characteristics of So (Thavung), a Vietic language of Thailand]. Retrieved 22. Nov. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Thavung makes a four-way distinction between clear and breathy phonation combined with glottalized final consonants. This is very similar to the situation in the [[Pearic languages]] in which, however, the glottalization is in the vowel.[http://sealang.net/mk/vietic.htm]

}}
'''{{Lang|la|Tonus peregrinus}}''', or the '''ninth tone''', is a [[reciting tone]] in [[Gregorian chant]].

==Characteristics==
As a reciting tone the {{Lang|la|tonus peregrinus}} does not fit in any of the original eight [[church mode]]s, because a verse recited in this tone has a different tenor note in the first half of the verse as in the second half of the verse.&lt;ref name="Lundberg2012p7-17"&gt;Lundberg 2012 pp. 7–17&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the tenor note in the first half of a verse sung according to the {{Lang|la|tonus peregrinus}} is a tone higher than the tenor note in the second half of the verse. Also usually the last note of a {{Lang|la|tonus peregrinus}} [[melodic formula]] is a [[perfect fifth]] below the first tenor note.&lt;ref name="Lundberg2012p7-17" /&gt;

==History==
In Gregorian chant the {{Lang|la|tonus peregrinus}} existed before the modal system was expanded beyond the eighth mode. Later the ninth tone became associated with the ninth mode, or [[Aeolian mode]], which, in a more modern understanding of harmony, can be equalled with a standard [[minor mode]].&lt;ref name="Lundberg2012p45"&gt;Lundberg 2012 p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Magnificat im 9. Psalmton deutsch (Luther).jpg|thumb|600px|The traditional German Magnificat, sung on a German variant of the ninth tone or {{Lang|la|tonus peregrinus}}]]
The {{Lang|la|tonus peregrinus}} is an exceptional reciting tone in Gregorian chant: there it was most clearly associated with [[Psalm 113]], traditionally sung in [[vespers]]. In [[Lutheranism]], the {{Lang|la|tonus peregrinus}} is associated with the [[Magnificat]] (also usually sung in vespers): the traditional setting of [[Martin Luther|Luther]]'s German translation of the Magnificat ("{{Lang|de|[[Meine Seele erhebt den Herren]]|italic=no}}") is a German variant of the {{Lang|la|tonus peregrinus}}.&lt;ref name="Lundberg2012p7-17" /&gt;

==Musical settings==
{{Lang|la|Tonus peregrinus}} variants appear in:
* "Suscepit Israel" from the [[Magnificat (Bach)|Magnificat in D major]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]
* [[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]] by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (used in the Introit)&lt;ref name="Lundberg2012p275"&gt;Lundberg 2012 p. 275 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sonata No. 4, Op. 98, by [[Josef Rheinberger]] (harmonized version is used as the second theme in the opening movement){{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4647">A '''''tussenvoegsel''''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈtɵsə(n)ˌvuxsəl|pron}}) in [[Dutch language|Dutch linguistics]] is a word that is positioned between a person's [[Given name|first name]] and the main part of the [[last name]] similar to Irish or Scottish [[Family_name#Surname_prefixes|surname prefixes]], [[French name|French ''particules'']] or German ''[[von]]''. The most common ''tussenvoegsels'' are "'''van'''" (as in [[Vincent van Gogh]]; see also [[van (Dutch)]]) meaning "from" and "'''de'''" (as in [[Greg de Vries]]), meaning "the". If a ''tussenvoegsel'' is present it forms an integral part of a surname, to separate it from similar Dutch surnames that include no ''tussenvoegsel'' (e.g. as in [[Jan_de_Boer_(footballer)|Jan de Boer]] versus [[Albert Boer]] and [[Frits de Kok]] versus [[Wim Kok]]). 

The use of ''tussenvoegsels'' differs between the Netherlands and Belgium.

==In the Netherlands==
In the Netherlands, these ''tussenvoegsels'' are not included when sorting alphabetically. For example, in the Dutch [[telephone directory]] the surname "De Vries" is listed under "V", not "D". Therefore, in Dutch [[database]]s ''tussenvoegsels'' are recorded separately. This often simplifies finding a Dutch surname in a Dutch database, because including the ''tussenvoegsel'' would result in many surnames being listed under "D" and "V".

According to Dutch language rules in the Netherlands, the ''tussenvoegsel'' in a surname is written with a capital letter only when it starts a sentence or is not preceded by a first name or initial. So referring to a Peter whose surname is "de Vries" we write "meneer '''D'''e Vries" (Mr De Vries), but "Peter '''d'''e Vries" and "P. '''d'''e Vries".

==In Belgium==
In Belgium, surnames are collated with the full surname including ''tussenvoegsels''. "De Smet" comes before "DeSmet" in a telephone book.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}
Although Francophone surnames commonly also have ''tussenvoegsels'', those are frequently contracted into the last name, turning e.g. Le Roc into Leroc or La Roche into LaRoche, thus explaining the collation preference.

In contrast to Dutch orthographic rules, in Belgium ''tussenvoegsels'' always keep their original [[orthography]], as in ''meneer Van Der Velde'', ''meneer P. Van Der Velde'' or ''Peter Van Der Velde''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onzetaal.nl/advies/tussenvoegsel.php Hoofdletters in eigennamen] Onze Taal Taaladvies&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
''Tussenvoegsels'' originate from the time that Dutch last names officially came into use. Many of the names are place names, which refer to cities (Van [[Coevorden]], for example) or geographical locations (such as Van den Velde, or "of the fields"). The following list of ''tussenvoegsels'' includes approximate translations, some of which have maintained their earlier meaning more than others.
