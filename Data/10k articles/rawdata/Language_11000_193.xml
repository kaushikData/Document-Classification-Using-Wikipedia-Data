'''Ahmad Kasravi''' (29 September 1890 &amp;ndash; 11 March 1946; {{lang-fa|احمد کسروی}}) was a notable [[Iran]]ian [[linguistics|linguist]], [[historian]], [[nationalist]] and reformer. 

Born in Hokmabad (Hohmavar), [[Tabriz]], [[Iran]], Kasravi was an [[Iranian Azeri]].&lt;ref&gt;V. Minorsky. ''Mongol Place-Names in Mukri Kurdistan'' (Mongolica, 4), Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. '''19''', No. 1, pp. 58-81 (1957), p. 66. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/609632 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iran and Its Place Among Nations, Alidad Mafinezam, Aria Mehrabi, 2008, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Kasravi enrolled in a seminary. Later, he joined the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]]. He experienced a sort of conversion to Western learning when he learned that the comet of 1910 had been identified as a reappearance of [[Halley's comet]].  He abandoned his clerical training after this event and enrolled in the [[American Memorial School of Tabriz]]. Thenceforward he became, in [[Roy Mottahedeh]]'s words, "a true anti-cleric."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mottahedeh|first1=Roy|title=The mantle of the prophet : religion and politics in Iran|date=2009|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location=Oxford [England]|isbn=9781851686162|page=104|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kasravi was associated with the [[Democrat Party (Persia)|Democrat Party]] in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lloyd Ridgeon|title=Religion and Politics in Modern Iran: A Reader|date=2005|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-073-4|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a professor of law at [[University of Tehran]] and also a lawyer in [[Tehran]], Iran. He was the founder of a political-social movement whose goal was to build an Iranian [[secular]] identity. The movement was formed during [[Pahlavi dynasty]].

He has authored more than 70 books, mostly in [[Persian language]]. The most important ones are "[[History of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution]]" and "Eighteen Years History of Azerbaijan", which are the among the most important literature works of [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]].

==Life==
It was in [[Tbilisi]] where he first became acquainted with a wide spectrum of political ideas and movements, and he soon was employed by the government of Iran in various cultural posts.

A prolific writer, Kasravi was very critical of both the [[Shi'a]] [[clergy]] and of the policies of the central government. His outspoken ways would lead him to have many supporters and critics starting from the Reza Shah period. While [[Abdolhossein Teymourtash]] was a strong supporter of his works, [[Mohammad Ali Foroughi]] is said to have taken strong exception to his literary theories and banned him from contributing to the Farhangestan or to continue publishing. Moreover, he had liberal views on [[religion]], was a strong supporter of [[democracy]], and expressed them in satirical pamphlets like ''What Is the Religion of the Hajis with Warehouses?'' that infuriated many readers.  His views earned him many powerful enemies such as [[Ayatollah Khomeini]].

His detailed account of the Constitutional Revolution still stands out as one of the most important sources on the events, even though Kasravi was a teenager at the time of the revolution and cannot claim the full authority of a contemporary witness that his writing at times suggests.

==Religion==
A proponent of [[Islamic Modernism|reform in Islam]],&lt;ref&gt;Charles D. Fletcher, "The Methodology of Abdolkarim Soroush: A Preliminary Study" in ''Islamic Studies'',  Vol. 44, No. 4 (Winter 2005), p. 531&lt;/ref&gt; he was respected for his deep knowledge of the religion, as "even his orthodox opponents admit that Kasravi was an able theologian and regard his ''Shari'ate Ahmadi'' as the best book on the fundamentals of Islam and Shi'ism of his time",&lt;ref&gt;Sohrab Behdad, "Utopia of Assassins: Nawab Safavi and the Fada'ian-e Eslamin Prerevolutionary Iran" in Ramin Jahanbegloo, ''Iran: Between Tradition and Modernity'', Lexington Books (2004), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; and, like Dr. [[Ali Shariati]] some three decades later, Kasravi considered that there were two kinds of Islam: &lt;blockquote&gt;[O]ne is the religion that that honorable Arab man brought one thousand, three hundred and fifty years ago and was established for centuries. The other is the Islam that there is today and has turned into many colors from Sunnism, Shi'ism, Esmaili, Aliollahi, Sheikhi, and Karimkhani, and the like. They call both Islam, but they are not one. They are completely different and are opposite of one another.... Nothing is left of that Islam.  This establishment that the mullas are running not only does not have any benefits but it also causes many harms and results in wretchedness.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Kasravi, ''Dar Piramoun-e Eslam'' (Tehran: Payedar, fifth printing, 1969), p.4 quoted by Sohrab Behdad, "Utopia of Assassins: Nawab Safavi and the Fada'ian-e Eslamin Prerevolutionary Iran" in Ramin Jahanbegloo, ''Iran: Between Tradition and Modernity'', Lexington Books (2004), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Basically, he believed and wrote that " all the present-day representations of Islam have been deviated from the essence and the true concept of its foundation".&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Ridgeon, ''Sufi Castigator: Ahmad Kasravi and the Iranian Mystical Tradition'', Routledge (2006), p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly critical of Shia ( since its formation since the sixth emam - emam Jafar Sadegh) and [[Sufism]], to which he ascribed many ills, from its supposed promotion of stagnation, "irrationality" or even being a tool of the [[Orientalists]].&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Ridgeon, ''Sufi Castigator: Ahmad Kasravi and the Iranian Mystical Tradition'', Routledge (2006), pp. 50-57&lt;/ref&gt; His main target in that field was the famous [[E.G. Browne]], appreciated by Iranian intellectuals of all tendencies, whom he accused to have favoured [[Sufi poetry]] in his history of [[Persian literature]], and thus trying to characterize the Iranian spirit with the errors he thinks belong to Sufis (immorality, irrationality, ...), further promoting idleness and passivity in order to keep Iran subjugated to foreign imperialists.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Ridgeon, ''Sufi Castigator: Ahmad Kasravi and the Iranian Mystical Tradition'', Routledge (2006), pp. 121-135&lt;/ref&gt; His criticism of [[Hafez Shirazi]] followed the same path, considering him "a source of disgrace",&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Ridgeon, ''Sufi Castigator: Ahmad Kasravi and the Iranian Mystical Tradition'', Routledge (2006) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; saying that his "immorality" was due to the fact that the [[Mongols]] were the new rulers in the region, not respectful of Islamic law, thus letting some Sufis (like Hafez) "free to indulge in drinking wine, whereas previously they had to be cautious not to offend the Islamic sentiments of the rulers and the religious authorities."&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Ridgeon, ''Sufi Castigator: Ahmad Kasravi and the Iranian Mystical Tradition'', Routledge (2006), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;
Kasravi was also critical about Bahai faith and considered it as another continuation of the same deviation that started from Shia ( penetration and influence of Old Iranian and Judisem beliefs about " a supposed to come savior" into Islam )to Shekhisem ( followers of Shiekh Ahmas Ahsaie, then Bobisem ( followers of seyed Mohammad Bob), then into Baha'i and Azali. These two latest sects were formed by two brothers who were followers of "Bob" once. ( bob in Arabic means door. Bob first claimed that he was the door between "the Savior" and the public, later on he claimed that he himself was "The Savior". )

Kasravi's "views threatened both modernist ( blind followers of western culture in materialistic concept) intellectuals (who worked along and gave legitimacy to traditionalists and Shia leaders who oppose progressive needed changes to modernize the country)  and the traditionalist cleric class", not only because of his vision of religion (apart from Shi'a faith and Sufism, he was also sceptical of [[Bahaism]]), but also due to his critical stance on [[secularism]] and the fact that he was "the first Iranian to criticize [[modernism]] and [[Eurocentrism]] before [[Jalal Al-e Ahmad|Al-e Ahmad]] coined the term “[[Weststruckness]]” and made it a genre."&lt;ref&gt;Farhang Rajaee, ''Islamism and Modernism: The Changing Discourse in Iran'', University of Texas Press (2010), pp. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selected Works ==
“God is with us” or “Khoda Ba Mast” is book by Ahmad Kasravi, talking about Sufism, published in 1944 and it has eight chapters. In the introduction he illustrates some common believes about Sufism, for example he says that Sufism has many followers and it is very diverse and Sophists are everywhere like Tehran, Mashhad, Shiraz Maragheh and ... Also, he says it is not true that science will destroy Sufism and talks about why European adore Sufism. He talks about the root of Sufism and its origin in Greek philosophy. Like his other books about Shia and Baha’i Ideologies he criticizes Sufism and talks about contradictions and flaws in Sufism in the second chapter, for example the fact that most of Sophist do not have any occupation and they do not get married or they do not care about life before death. In the third chapter is about Islam and Sufism and the bad thing that Sufism followers have done to Islam. The next chapter is about the negative effect of Sufism on its followers because of the nature of the ideology. In the sixth chapter he calls Sufism followers liars and criticize their books and what they say as “Kramat”. The next two chapters are about Mongolians attack to Iran and relationship with Sufism, Kasravi blames Sufism for Iran’s defeat. The last chapter is about a Greek philosopher called “Plotinus”, which Kasravi believes is the founder of Sufism and criticizing his ideas. The book is attacking all the ideologies of Sufism and bring some examples from Sufism books.
==Works about the old Azeri language==
Kasravi is known for his solid and controversial research work on the [[ancient Azari language]]. He showed that the ancient Azari language was an offshoot of [[Middle Persian|Pahlavi language]]. Due to this discovery, he was granted membership of the London [[Royal Asiatic Society]] and American Academy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naghed.net/Maghale_ha/Kasravi.htm احمد کسروی؛ پژوهشگری،سرکشی و خرده نگری Khosro Naghed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209172657/http://www.naghed.net/Maghale_ha/Kasravi.htm |date=February 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguing that the [[ancient Azari language]] had been closely related to [[Persian language]] and the influx of Turkic words began only with the Seljuq invasion, Ahmad Kasravi believed that the true national language of [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] was Persian and therefore advocated the linguistic assimilation of Persian in Azarbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tadeusz Swietochowski]], ''Russia and a Borderland in Transition Azerbaijan'', 122-289 p. (Columbia University Press, 1995). {{ISBN|0-231-07068-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1927-8 Ahmad Kasravi led the way in establishing the ancestry of the Safavids dynasty with the publication of three influential articles, and disputed the validity of the 'official' Safavid family tree contained in the Safvat al-Safa, and argued convincingly that the ancestors of Shaykh Safi al-Din, who founded the Safavid Order (tariqa), were indigenous inhabitants of Iran. Today, the consensus among Safavid historians is that the Safavid family hailed from [[Iranian Kurdistan|Persian Kurdistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savory |first=Roger M. |url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/reflections_safavid_history_historiography1.php |title=Iran Chamber Society: History of Iran: Is there an ultimate use for historians? Reflections on Safavid history and historiography |publisher=Iranchamber.com |date=1995-03-16 |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assassination ==
On 11 March 1946, while being tried on charges of "slander against Islam," Kasravi and one of his assistants named Seyyed Mohammad Taghi Haddadpour, were knifed and killed in [[Kakh Dadgostari Tehran|open court]] in Tehran by followers of [[Navvab Safavi]], a Shi'a extremist cleric who had founded an organization called the [[Fadayan-e Islam]] (literally ''Devotees of Islam''), lead by two brothers, Hossein and Ali-Mohammad Emami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amini|first1=Mohammad|title=KASRAVI, AḤMAD ii. ASSASSINATION|publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica|pages=Vol. XVI, Fasc. 1, p. 92-94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same group had failed in assassinating Kasravi earlier in April 1945 in [[Tehran]]. [[Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi|Ayatollah Borujerdi]] and Ayatollah [[Sadr al-Din al-Sadr]] had issued fatwas for killing Ahmad Kasravi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iichs.org/index.asp?id=266&amp;doc_cat=8 |title=IICHS موسسه مطالعات تاريخ معاصر ايران |publisher=Iichs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6898">'''Armchair revolutionary''' is a two-word cliche which, along with the similar terms '''armchair activist''' and '''armchair socialist''', is a description of a speaker or writer who professes radical aims without taking any action to realize them ("from the comfort of the armchair").

== Examples ==

In 1937 [[Nikolai Berdyaev]] wrote, "After years of living in Western Europe, [[Georgi_Plekhanov|Plekhanov]] became entirely a Western and of a very rationalist sort, fairly cultured, although his culture was not of the highest kind; more of an armchair revolutionary than a practical one. He could be a leader of a Marxist school of thought, but he could not be a leader of a revolution; that was made clear at the time of the revolution."{{r|Berdyaev-1960|p=94}}

Columnist [[Julie Burchill]] highlighted the relative the level of energy exhibited in this lede: "During a long hard winter, nothing warms the cold blood of the Western armchair revolutionary more than the sight of a bunch of attractive dark-skinned people out on the streets having a right old revolution."{{r|Burchill-2011-02-03}}

== In culture ==

The Guardian used the cliche in this headline: "We’re a nation of armchair activists—and that's OK, says Bridget Christie".{{r|Christie-2015-04-11}}

William Graham titled his travel book ''Latin America: Notes from an Armchair Revolutionary''.{{r|Graham-2016}}

In December 2014, the ''[[The BMJ|BMJ]]'' published a study, possibly satirical in intent and described as "lighthearted" in ''[[National Health Service (England)#Internet information service|NHS Choices]]'', with the purported purpose of determining how political affiliation correlates with (literal) physical activity levels. The study's stated conclusion was that (literal) "armchair socialists" as a class do not exist, as holders of political views toward either end of the spectrum (Left or Right) tend to be more physically active than political centrists.{{r|Bauman-Gale-and-Milton-2014}}{{r|Bazian-2014-12-15}}

The '''Aslian languages''' are a family of [[Austroasiatic languages]] spoken on the [[Malay Peninsula]]. They are the languages of many of the ''[[Orang Asli]]'', the aboriginal inhabitants of the peninsula. The total number of native speakers of Aslian languages is about fifty thousand and all are in danger of extinction. Aslian languages recognized by the Malaysian administration include [[Kensiu language|Kensiu]], [[Kintaq language|Kintaq]], [[Jahai language|Jahai]], [[Minriq language|Minriq]], [[Batek language|Batek]], [[Cheq Wong language|Cheq Wong]], [[Lanoh language|Lanoh]], [[Temiar language|Temiar]], [[Semai language|Semai]], [[Jah Hut language|Jah Hut]], [[Mah Meri language|Mah Meri]], [[Semaq Beri language|Semaq Beri]], [[Semelai language|Semelai]], and [[Temoq language|Temoq]].&lt;ref name="Austroasiatic Subgroupings And Prehistory In The Malay Peninsula"&gt;Geoffrey Benjamin (1976) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20019154 Austroasiatic Subgroupings and Prehistory in the Malay Peninsula] Jenner ''et al'' Part I, pp. 37–128&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==
Aslian languages originally appeared on the western side of the main mountains and eventually spread eastwards into [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]], and [[Pahang]].&lt;ref name= "Aslian: characteristics and usage."/&gt; The nearest relatives to the Aslian languages are [[Monic languages|Monic]] and [[Nicobarese]].&lt;ref name="Why are Aslian speakers Austronesian in culture."&gt;Blench, R. (2006): [http://www.rogerblench.info/Language%20data/Austroasiatic/Roger%20Blench%20Siem%20Reap%202006%20paper.pdf Why are Aslian speakers Austronesian in culture] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221105722/http://www.rogerblench.info/Language%20data/Austroasiatic/Roger%20Blench%20Siem%20Reap%202006%20paper.pdf |date=February 21, 2011 }}. Paper presented at
the Preparatory meeting for ICAL-3, Siem Reap.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a possibility the early Monic and Nicobarese people had contact with the migrants who moved into the Malay Peninsula from further north.

Aslian languages contain a complex [[palimpsest]] of loanwords from linguistic communities that no longer exist on the Malay Peninsula. Their former residence can be traced from the etymologies and the archaeological evidence for the succession of cultures in the region. [[Roger Blench]] (2006)&lt;ref name="Blench2006"&gt;Blench, Roger. 2006. Why are Aslian speakers Austronesian in culture? Papers presented at ICAL-3, Siem Reap, Cambodia.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that Aslian languages have many [[Bornean languages|Bornean]] and [[Chamic languages|Chamic]] loanwords, pointing to a former presence of Bornean and Chamic speakers on the [[Malay Peninsula]].

Blagden (1906),&lt;ref&gt;Blagden, C. O. 1906. ‘Language.’ In: W. W. Skeat and C. O. Blagden, Pagan races of the Malay Peninsula, volume 2,
London: MacMillan, pp. 379-775.&lt;/ref&gt; Evans (1937),&lt;ref&gt;Evans, I. H. N. 1937. The Negritos of Malaya. London: Frank Cass.&lt;/ref&gt; and Blench (2006)&lt;ref name="Blench2006"/&gt; note that Aslian languages, especially the Northern Aslian ([[Jahaic languages|Jahaic]]) group, contain many words that cannot be traced to any currently known language family. The extinct [[Kenaboi language]] of [[Negeri Sembilan]] also contains many words of unknown origin in addition to words of Austroasiatic and Austronesian origin.

==Classification==
*'''[[Jahaic languages]]''' ("Northern Aslian"): [[Cheq Wong language|Cheq Wong]]; [[Ten'edn]] (Mos); (Eastern) [[Batek language|Batek]], [[Jahai language|Jahai]], [[Minriq language|Minriq]], [[Mintil language|Mintil]]; (Western) [[Kensiu language|Kensiu]], [[Kintaq language|Kintaq]] (Kentaqbong), Maniq.
*'''[[Senoic languages]]''' ("Central Aslian"): [[Semai language|Semai]], [[Temiar language|Temiar]], [[Lanoh language|Lanoh]], *[[Sabüm language|Sabüm]], [[Semnam language|Semnam]].
*'''[[Southern Aslian languages]]''' (Semelaic): [[Mah Meri language|Mah Meri]] (Besisi), [[Semelai language|Semelai]], [[Temoq language|Temoq]], [[Semaq Beri language|Semaq Beri]].
*''[[Jah Hut language|Jah Hut]]''.

The extinct [[Kenaboi language|Kenaboi]] language is unclassified, and may or may not be Aslian.

Phillips (2012:194)&lt;ref name="Phillips2012"/&gt; lists the following consonant sound changes that each Aslian branch had innovated from [[Proto-Aslian language|Proto-Aslian]].
*[[Jahaic languages|Northern Aslian]]: Proto-Aslian *sə– &gt; ha–
*[[Southern Aslian languages|Southern Aslian]]: loss of Proto-Aslian *-ʔ (final glottal stop)
* Proto-Aslian *–N &gt; *–DN in all branches except [[Jah Hut language|Jah Hut]]

==Reconstruction==
{{main|Proto-Aslian language}}
The Proto-Aslian language has been reconstructed by Timothy Phillips (2012).&lt;ref name="Phillips2012"&gt;Phillips, Timothy C. 2012. ''Proto-Aslian: towards an understanding of its historical linguistic systems, principles and processes''. Ph.D. thesis, Institut Alam Dan Tamadun Melayu Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==

=== Syllable structure ===
Aslian words may either be monosyllabic, sesquisyllabic or disyllabic:

:'''Monosyllabic''': either simple CV(C) or complex CCV(C).&lt;ref name= "Aslian: Mon Khmer of Malay Peninsular"&gt;Matissoff, J. 2003. [http://sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/33:1-58.pdf Aslian: Mon–Khmer of Malay Peninsular] Mon Khmer Studies 33:1&amp;ndash;58&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Sesquisyllabic''':&lt;ref name="Tonogenesis in Southeast Asia"&gt;Matisoff, James A, 1973. ''Tonogenesis in Southeast Asia''.
In Larry M. Hyman, ed., ''CTT'' 71-95&lt;/ref&gt; consist of a major syllable with fully stressed vowel, preceded by a minor syllable
::'''Temiar''' ''ləpud'' 'caudal fin'
::'''Semai''' ''kʔɛːp'' [kɛʔɛːp] 'centipede'&lt;ref name="Minor-syllabic vocalism in Senoic languages."&gt;Diffloth, Gerard.1976a. Minor-syllably vocalism in Senoic languages. In Jenner et al., Vol. I, pp 229–2480&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Disyllabic:''' more morphologically complex, resulting from various [[reduplication]]s and [[infixation]]s. Compounds with unreduced though unstressed vowels also occur:
::'''Temiar''' ''diŋ-rəb'' 'shelter'
: Loanwords from Malay are a further source of disyllables:
::'''Jah Hut''' ''suraʔ'' 'sing', from Malay; ''suara'' 'voice'
::'''Semai''' ''tiba:ʔ'' 'arrive', from Malay; ''tiba'' 'arrive'&lt;ref name="Semoq Beri: some preliminary remarks"&gt;Nik Safiah Karim and Ton Dinti Ibrahim. 1979. "Semoq Beri: some preliminary remarks." ''FMJ (n.s)'' 24:17–31&lt;/ref&gt;

:Temiar even has phonetic '''trisyllables''' in morphological categories such as the middle [[causative]] (''tərakɔ̄w'')&lt;ref name="An outline of Temiar grammar"&gt;Benjamin, Geoffrey. 1976b. "An outline of Temiar grammar". In Jenner et al, eds., Vol I, pp. 129–87 ''(OTG)''&lt;/ref&gt; and the continuative causative (''tərɛwkɔ̄w''), or in words with [[proclitic]]s (''barhalab ~ behalab'' 'go downriver').

=== Initial consonants ===
Aslian words generally start with a consonant. Words which start with a vowel will be followed by a glottal stop.&lt;ref name= "Aslian: characteristics and usage."&gt;Asmah Hji Omar (volume editor), 2004. 'Aslian languages', 'Aslian: characteristics and usage.', ''The encyclopedia of Malaysia, volume 12: Languages and literatures,'' Kuala Lumpur. Archipelago Press, pp. 46–49&lt;/ref&gt; In most Aslian languages, [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] consonants are analyzed as sequences of two phonemes, one of which happens to be ''h''.

Aslian syllable-initial consonant clusters are rich and varied. [[Stop consonant|Stops]] for example may cluster without restrictions to their [[place of articulation]] or [[Voice (phonetics)|voicing]]:
:'''Jah Hut''' ''tkak'' 'palate', ''dkaŋ'' 'bamboo rat', ''bkul'' 'gray', ''bgɔk'' 'goiter' &lt;ref name="Jah Hut, an Austroasiatic language of Malaysia"&gt;Diffloth, Gerard. 1976c. "Jah Hut, an Austroasiatic language of Malaysia." In Nguyen Dang Liem, ed., ''SALS'' II:73-118, Canberra: Pacific Linguistics C-42&lt;/ref&gt;

Articulation of laryngeal consonants {{IPA|/h, ʔ/}} may be superimposed upon the vowel midway in its articulation, giving the impression of two identical vowels interrupted by the laryngeals.
:'''Jah Hut''' {{IPA|/jʔaŋ/ [jaʔaŋ]}} 'bone', {{IPA|/ɲhɔːʡ/ [ɲɔˑhɔˑʡ]}}&lt;!--Originally macrons on all vowels; semi-long marks added to phonetics to not imply extra lengthening--&gt; 'tree' &lt;ref name="Minor-syllabic vocalism in Senoic languages." /&gt;

=== Vowels ===
A typical Aslian vowel system is displayed by '''Northern''' '''Temiar''', which has 30 vocalic nuclei.&lt;ref name="An outline of Temiar grammar" /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! colspan="2"| Oral !! colspan="2"| Nasal
|-
| || ''short'' || ''long'' || ''short'' || ''long''
|-
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| {{IPA|i ʉ u}} || {{IPA|iː ʉː uː}} || {{IPA|ĩ ʉ̃ ũ}} || {{IPA|ĩː ʉ̃ː ũː}}
|-
! [[Mid vowel|Mid]]
| {{IPA|e ə o}} || {{IPA|eː əː oː}} || N/A || N/A
|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| {{IPA|ɛ a ɔ}} || {{IPA|ɛː aː ɔː}} || {{IPA|ɛ̃ ã ɔ̃}} || {{IPA|ɛ̃ː ãː ɔ̃ː}}
|}

The functional load of the nasal/oral contrast is not very high in Aslian languages (not many [[minimal pairs]] can be cited). Diffloth&lt;ref name="Towards a history of Mon–Khmer: proto-Semai vowels"&gt;Diffloth, Gerard. 1977. "Towards a history of Mon–Khmer: proto-Semai vowels." ''Tōnan Azia Kenkyū (Kyoto)'' 14(4):463-495&lt;/ref&gt; states that this phenomenon is unpredictable and irregular in '''Semai''' dialects, especially on vowels preceded by ''h''- or'' ʔ''-.

Phonemic vowel length has been retained in Senoic languages such as '''Semai''', '''Temiar''' and '''Sabum'''. Contrastive length has been lost in the Northern and Southern Aslian branches. The loss of vowel length must have led to complex reorganizations in the vocalic systems of the affected languages, by developing new contrasts elsewhere.

[[Diphthongization]] is not as obvious in Aslian languages as compared to the other branches of Mon–Khmer. Proto-'''Semai''' is reconstructed with 10-11 long monophthongal vowels, but with only one diphthong, {{IPA|/iə/}}.&lt;ref name= "Aslian: Mon Khmer of Malay Peninsular" /&gt;

Senoic infixes are sensitive to the number of initial consonants in a root. Rising diphthongs like {{IPA|[i̯ə]}} or {{IPA|[u̯ə]}} are ambiguous, since the glide may be interpreted as either a feature of the initial or of the vowel.

=== Final consonants ===

Aslian languages are well endowed with final consonants,&lt;ref name= "Aslian: Mon Khmer of Malay Peninsular" /&gt; with most of the languages placing a lot of stress on them.&lt;ref name= "Aslian: characteristics and usage." /&gt;

* ''-r, -l, -s, -h'' and ''-ʔ'' are represented and well-preserved in Aslian.&lt;ref name="Sino-Tibetan: a Conspectus"&gt;Benedict, Paul K. 1972. ''Sino-Tibetan: a Conspectus.'' Contributing ed., James A. Matisoff. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a tendency to shorten long vowels before these finals.&lt;ref name="The vocalism of Proto Mon–Khmer"&gt;Shorto, Harry L. 1976. "The vocalism of Proto Mon–Khmer." In Jenner et al., eds., Vol. II, pp. 1041–1067&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported that Temiar -''h'' has bilabial friction after -''u''-, e.g. {{IPA|/tuh/}} 'speak' pronounced as {{IPA|[tuɸ]}}.&lt;ref name="An outline of Temiar grammar" /&gt;

Throughout the Aslian family, final nasals are [[pre-stopped nasal|pre-stopped]]. In Northern Aslian this has gone further, with final nasals merging with the plosive series.

==Morphology==
All Aslian languages that have been thoroughly studied have constructive usage of various morphophonemic devices – prefixation, infixation and reduplication. Also, most Aslian languages preserve fossilized traces of other morphological patterns that are no longer productive.&lt;ref name= "Aslian: Mon Khmer of Malay Peninsular" /&gt;

It was also noted that the use of the suffix in Aslian languages was a product of recent use of Malay loan words. For example, the use of the infix 'n' is prominent in various Aslian language and it encompasses a myriad of definition.&lt;ref name= "Aslian: characteristics and usage." /&gt;

===Simple prefixation===

*'''C(C)VC → (P)(P)–C(C)VC'''

Example: '''Jah Hut''' causatives &lt;ref name= "Aslian: Mon Khmer of Malay Peninsular" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Affixes !! Simplex !! Causative
|-
| p- || ''cyɛk'' 'sleep' || ''pcyɛk'' 'put to sleep'
|-
| pr- || ''bhec'' 'be afraid' || ''prbhec'' 'frighten'
|-
| pn- || ''tlas'' 'escape' || ''pntlas'' 'release'
|-
| tr- || ''hus'' 'get loose (clothes)' || ''trhus'' 'undress'
|-
| kr- || ''lʉy'' 'be inside' || ''krlʉy'' 'put inside'
|}

===Simple infixation&lt;ref name= "Aslian: Mon Khmer of Malay Peninsular" /&gt;===

*'''C (C) V C → C-I-(C) V C'''

Aslian languages insert infixes between two consonants. Simple infixation is when the infix is inserted into the root. The most important liquid infix is the causative -r-, which is productive in Semai and Temiar. 
*'''Semai''' (root has 2 initial consonants, infix comes between them): ''kʔā:c'' 'be wet', ''krʔā:c'' 'moisten something'.&lt;ref name="Ambiguïtè morphologique en semai"&gt;Diffloth, Gerard. 1972b. Ambiguïtè morphologique en semai. In J. Thomas and L.Bernot, eds. LTNS I:91-93, Paris: Klincksieck&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasal infixes are also found in Aslian, especially used as nominalizers of verbal roots. 
*'''Jah Hut''' (the agentive nominalizing prefix is ''mʔ-''): ''lyɛp'' 'plait palm leaves' → ''mlayɛp'' 'one who plaits'; ''cyɛk'' 'sleep' → ''mʔcyɛk'' 'one who sleeps a lot'

===Reduplicative infixation: incopyfixation&lt;ref name= "Aslian: Mon Khmer of Malay Peninsular" /&gt;===

A reduplication of the final consonant of the root is being infixed to the root. This process &lt;ref name="Minor-syllabic vocalism in Senoic languages." /&gt; occurs in all 3 branches of Aslian.

#'''Incopyfix of final alone''' (roots complex by nature):&lt;ref name= "Aslian: Mon Khmer of Malay Peninsular" /&gt;'''
#*'''Kensiw''': ''plɔɲ'' 'sing' → ''pɲlɔɲ'' 'singing'
#*'''Che' Wong''': ''hwæc'' 'whistle' → ''hcwæc'' 'whistling'
# '''Root-external infix plus incopyfix.&lt;ref name= "Aslian: Mon Khmer of Malay Peninsular" /&gt;''' In '''Semai''', count nouns are derived from mass nouns by using a root-external nasal infix and an incopyfix of the final. When the root-initial is simple, the incopyfix precedes the infix:
#*''teːw'' 'river' (mass) →''twneːw'' {{IPA|[tuniːw]}} 'id.' (count).&lt;br/&gt;When the root-initial is complex, the infix precedes the incopyfix:
#*''slaːy'' 'swidden' (mass) → ''snylaːy'' {{IPA|[snilaːj]}} 'id.' (count)
#'''Root-external prefix plus incopyfix.&lt;ref name= "Aslian: Mon Khmer of Malay Peninsular" /&gt;''' Simple-initialled verbs are formed by inserting the prefix ''n-'' and incopyfixing the final between prefix and the root-initial:
#*'''Batek''': ''jɯk'' 'breathe' → ''nkjɯk'' 'the act of breathing'
# '''Reduplication of the initial and a root-external infix.&lt;ref name= "Aslian: Mon Khmer of Malay Peninsular" /&gt;''' This is present in '''Semai''' and '''Temiar''', which have a verbal infix ''-a-''. In '''Semai''', it forms resultative verbs, while in '''Temiar''', it marks the 'simulfactive aspect'.&lt;ref name= "Minor-syllable vocalism in Senoic languages"&gt;Diffloth, Gerard. 1976a. "Minor-syllable vocalism in Senoic languages." In Jenner et al., Vol. I, pp. 229–248.&lt;/ref&gt; In both languages, if the root has two consonants, the suffix''-a-'' is inserted between them:
#*'''Semai''': ''slɔːr'' 'lay flat objects into round container' → ''salɔːr'' 'be in layers (in round container)'
#*'''Temiar''': ''slɔg'' 'lie down, sleep, marry' → ''salɔg'' 'go straight off to sleep'&lt;br/&gt;If the consonant initial of the root is simple, it is reduplicated so that the ''-a-'' can be inserted between the original and its copy.
#*'''Semai''': ''cɛ̃ːs'' 'tear off' → ''cacɛ̃ːs'' 'be torn off'
#*'''Temiar''': ''gəl'' 'sit' → ''gagəl'' 'sit down suddenly'
#'''Reduplication of the initial and incopyfixation of the final.&lt;ref name= "Aslian: Mon Khmer of Malay Peninsular" /&gt;''' A simple initial is reduplicated for the incopyfixation of the final. In Aslian, this is used to derive the progressive verbs.&lt;ref name= "Les langues mon-khmer de Malaisie"&gt;Diffloth, Gerard. 1975. "Les langues mon-khmer de Malaisie: classification historique et innovations." ''ASEMI'' 6(4):1-19.&lt;/ref&gt;
#*'''Batek''' (N.Aslian): ''kɯc'' 'grate' → ''kckɯc'' 'is grating'
#*'''Semelai''' (S.Aslian): ''tʰəm'' 'pound' → ''tmtʰəm'' 'is pounding'
#*'''Semai''' (Senoic): ''laal'' 'stick out one's tongue' → ''lllaal'' 'is sticking out one's tongue'

==Grammar==
Aslian syntax is presumably conservative with respect to Austroasiatic as a whole, though Malay influence is apparent in some details of the grammar (e.g. use of numeral classifiers).&lt;ref name= "Aslian: Mon Khmer of Malay Peninsular" /&gt;

*

=== Basic and permuted word order ===

* Senoic sentences are prepositional and seem to fall into two basic types – process (active) and stative. In stative sentences, the predicate comes first:
{| 
|-
|rowspan="3" valign="top"|(1)
| ''Mənūʔ'' || ''ʔəh (big, it)'' 
|-
| VP || NP (Subject) 
|-
| colspan="2"| It's big.
|}

* In process sentences, the subject normally comes first, with the object and all other complements following the verb:
{| 
|-
|rowspan="3" valign="top"|(2)
| ''Cwəʔ'' || ''yəh-'' || ''mʔmus''
|-
| NP (Subj) || P (Pfx) || V
|-
| colspan="3"| The dog growls.
|}

* In '''Jah Hut''', all are complements, but the direct object require a preposition:
{| 
|-
|rowspan="4" valign="top"|(3)
| ''ʔihãh'' || ''naʔ'' || ''cɔp'' || ''rap'' || ''tuy'' || ''han'' || ''bulus''
|-
| NP (Subj) || Aux || V || N (Obj) || Det || Prep || Obj
|-
| I || INTENT || stab || boar || that || with || spear
|-
| colspan="7"| I'll stab that boar with a spear
|}

* Relative clauses, similar verbal modifiers, possessives, demonstratives and attributive nouns follow their head-noun:
{| 
|-
|rowspan="4" valign="top"|(4)
| ''ʔidɔh'' || ''pləʔ'' || ''kɔm'' || ''bɔʔ-caʔ'' ||
|-
| NP (Subj) || N (H) || Aux || P (Pfx) V ||
|-
| this || fruit || can || 1p-pl, eat
|-
| colspan="4"| This is a fruit which we can eat.
|}

* The negative morpheme precedes the verb, though the personal prefix may intervene before the verb root:
{|

=== Deixis, directionality and voice ===

Senoic languages set much store by deictic precision. This manifests itself in their elaborate pronominal systems, which make inclusive/exclusive and dual/plural distinctions, and take the trouble to reflect the person and number of the subject by a prefixal concordpronoun on the verb.&lt;ref name= "Aslian: Mon Khmer of Malay Peninsular" /&gt;

Locative deixis pays careful attention to the relative position (both horizontal and vertical) of speaker and hearer, even when it may be quite irrelevant to the message:

{|

|rowspan="3" valign="top"|(6)

==Lexicon and semantics==
The Aslian languages have borrowed from each other.&lt;ref name="Austroasiatic Subgroupings And Prehistory In The Malay Peninsula" /&gt;

Austroasiatic languages have a penchant for encoding semantically complex ideas into unanalyzable, monomorphemic lexemes e.g. Semai ''thãʔ'' 'to make fun of elders sexually'.&lt;ref name= "Relations between the animals and the humans in Semai society"&gt;Diffloth, Gerard. 1976e. "Relations between the animals and the humans in Semai society." Handout for lecture presented at Southeast Asian Center, Kyoto University, Nov. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Such lexical specificity makes for a proliferation of lexicon.

Lexicon elaboration is particularly great in areas which reflect the interaction of the Aslians with their natural environment (plant and animal nomenclature, swidden agriculture terminology etc.). The greatest single sweller of the Aslian vocabulary is the class of words called ''expressive''.&lt;ref name= "Expressives in Semai"&gt;Diffloth, Gerard. 1976b. "Expressives in Semai". In Jenner et al., Vol. I, pp. 249–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Expressives are words which describe sounds, visual phenomena, bodily sensations, emotions, smells, tastes etc., with minute precision and specificity.&lt;ref name= "Aslian: Mon Khmer of Malay Peninsular" /&gt; They are characterized by special morphophonemic patterns, and make extensive use of sound symbolism. Unlike nouns and verbs, expressives are lexically non-discrete, in that they are subject to a virtually unlimited number of semantic nuancings that are conveyed by small changes in their pronunciation.

For example, in Semai, various noises and movements of flapping wings, thrashing fish etc. are depicted by an open set of morphophonemically related expressives like ''parparpar, krkpur, knapurpur, purpurpur'' etc.&lt;ref name= "Aslian: Mon Khmer of Malay Peninsular" /&gt;

==Influences from other languages==

The Aslian languages have links with numerous languages. This is evident in the numerous borrowings from early Austronesian languages, specifically those from Borneo. There was a possibility that migrants from Borneo settled in the Malay Peninsula 3000–4000 years ago and established cultural dominance over the Aslian speakers. Aslian words also contain words of Chamic, Acehnese and Malayic origin.&lt;ref name="Why are Aslian speakers Austronesian in culture."/&gt; For example, several Aslian languages made use of Austronesian classifiers, even though classifiers exist in the Aslian language.&lt;ref name= "The Influence of Non-Austroasiatic Languages on Numeral Classification in Austroasiatic"&gt;Adams, L, Karen. 1991. "The Influence of Non-Austroasiatic Languages on Numeral Classification in Austroasiatic". Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 111, No. 1 (Jan–Mar 1991), pp. 62–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aslian languages do not succumb to any great deal of phonological change, yet borrowings from Malay are substantial. This is a result of constant interactions between the Orang Asli and Malays around the region. There is a more significant Malay influence among the nomadic Orang Asli population than within the farming Orang Asli population, as the farmers tend to be situated in the more remote areas and lead a subsistence lifestyle, and thus are less affected by interaction with the Malay language.&lt;ref name= "Aslian: characteristics and usage." /&gt;

==Endangerment and extinction==

All Aslian languages are endangered as they are spoken by a small group of people, with contributing factors including speaker deaths and linguistic assimilation with the Malay community. Some efforts are being made to preserve the Aslian languages in Malaysia. Some radio stations in Malaysia broadcast in Aslian languages for nine hours every day. Other media such as newspapers, magazine-type programs and dramas are broadcast in Aslian languages.&lt;ref name= "Aslian: characteristics and usage." /&gt;

Only a small group of Orang Asli receive formal education in the Aslian languages. Most of the younger Orang Asli use Malay as the medium of instruction in school. There is currently only a total of 5 schools in the state of Pahang and 2 schools in the state of Perak which teach Aslian languages, due to the lack of qualified teachers and teaching aids, which are still in the process of development.&lt;ref name= "Aslian: characteristics and usage."/&gt;

Some Aslian languages are already extinct, such as [[Wila' language|Wila']] (also called Bila' or Lowland Semang), which was recorded having been spoken on the [[Province Wellesley]] coast opposite [[Penang]] in the early 19th century. Another extinct language is Ple-Temer, which was previously spoken near [[Gerik]] in northern [[Perak]].&lt;ref name="Aslian: characteristics and usage."/&gt;

'''Babu Gulabrai''' (17 January 1888 – 13 April 1963) was a significant figure in modern [[Hindi]] literature.

==Biography==
Babu Gulabrai he is a extremely good who was born in [[Etawah]], where his father, Babu Bhawani Prasad, was a munsarif in the judicial court.  His mother was  Gomati Devi and he had both a brother and a sister. He spent his early life at [[Mainpuri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dhavana Madhu|title=Hinisahitya Ka Sanshipit Itihas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tqIdBaOLHooC&amp;pg=PA157|year=2006|publisher=Vānī Prakāśana|isbn=978-81-8143-585-9|pages=157–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gulabrai completed his MA in Philosophy and also his LLB at [[Agra University]]. He started writing philosophical essays in English and switched to Hindi in order to promote it as a national language. His first two works, ''Shanti Dharma'' and ''Maitri Dharma'', reflected his ideology and interests.

He then worked for the Maharaja of [[Chhatarpur]] as private secretary, prime minister and chief justice. After the death of Maharaja, he returned to Agra and resumed writing. He taught at [[St Johns College, Agra]], and was noted for his teaching skills as well as his friendly attitude towards students.

He was conferred with an honorary doctorate from Agra University in the year 1957 by [[V. V. Giri]]. He continued writing until his death on 13 April 1963

Babu Gulabrai was married to Bhagwati Devi of [[Meerut]]. He had three sons and five daughters.

In June 2002, the [[Government of India]] issued a 5 [[Rupee|Rs]] stamp to commemorate his contribution to Hindi literature.

==Literary works==
Gulabrai wrote a history of Hindi literature, ''Hindi ka subodh itihaas'' and developed a unique style of self-satire, which is very prominent in his biographies titled ''Meri Asafaltaein'' and ''Thalua Club''. He also started a literary magazine called ''Sahitya Sandesh''.

His works can be broadly divided into three categories.
*Philosophical. Most of his early work comes into this category .As he was a philosopher by education as well as profession (his work in the court of the maharaja included him being a "philosophical companion" of the king.) He was greatly inspired by the Gandhian philosophy and many of his works provide an analytical as well as scientific defence of it. ''Rashtriyata'', which is a compilation of essays on nationalism, is one of the most mature and rationalistic descriptions of nationalism. He advocates the principle of harmony between internationalism, nationalism and regionalism, giving priority to them in this order.
*Literary essays. He was a prominent Hindi critic of ''Dwivedi'' and ''Shukla Yuga'' during the early half of the 20th century, which was the golden age of Hindi literature. He, along with the likes of Mahaveer Prasad Dwivedi and Acharya Ramchandra Shukla, gave the form a much-needed philosophical and analytical impetus.
*Satire. His output as a satirist include the most famous of his works that were produced in the later part of his life. His autobiography, ''Meri Asafaltain'' ("my Failures") was one of these and in it he made himself an object of humour and entertained the reader with an account of the failures of his life.

==Language==
The language used by him was Sanskritized version of Hindi. His initial works were in English and as he himself admits that he started writing in Hindi due to patriotic reasons and his knowledge of Sanskrit helped him in that. Hence we find heavy usage of Sanskrit words and ''shlokas''. Unlike other essayist and critics of his time, he always tried to make his work simple (but analytical) and accessible to all which gained him much of the popularity.

==Others==

There are several schools that have been named after his name. Few of them are following:

# Shri Gulab Rai Montessori School, [[Bareilly]]. From Class KG to V. This school is affiliated to CBSE board, Delhi.
#Shri Gulab Rai Montessori Senior Secondary School, Bareilly. From Class VI to XII. This school is affiliated to CBSE board, Delhi.
#Shri Gulab Rai Inter College, Bareilly. From Class VI to XII. This school is affiliated to UP board, Allahabad.

[[File:Bulgaria during World War I.png|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Balkans Campaign (World War I)|The Bulgarian campaign]], showing the state of the Balkans during the [[First World War]]]]
'''Balkanization''', or '''Balkanisation''', is a [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] term for the process of fragmentation or division of a region or state into smaller regions or states that are often hostile or uncooperative with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=Balkanize |url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/balkanized |dictionary=Merriam-Webster Online |access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Vidanović|2006}} Balkanisation is a result of foreign policies creating geopolitical fragmentation, as has happened in the namesake [[Balkans|Balkan region]] under the [[History of the Balkans#Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia|Austro-Hungarian empire]].
{{Basic forms of government}}
{{Politics sidebar|expanded=Subseries}}

==Nations and societies==
The term refers to the division of the [[Balkan peninsula]], formerly ruled almost entirely by the [[Ottoman Empire]], into a number of smaller states between 1817 and 1912.{{sfn|Pringle|2016}} It was coined in the early 19th century and has a strong negative connotation.{{sfn|Simic|2013|p=128}} The term however came into common use in the immediate aftermath of the [[First World War]], with reference to the numerous new states that arose from the collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The larger countries within Europe, often being the result of the union of several historical regions or nations, have faced the perceived issue of Balkanisation. The [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Spain]] especially has from the time of [[Al-Andalus]] had to come to terms with Balkanisation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/28/world/europe/28iht-spain.html | work=The New York Times | first=Renwick | last=McLean | title=Catalonia steps up to challenge Spain | date=29 September 2005 | access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with several separatist movements existing today including the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[Catalan independentism]].

[[Canada]] is a stable country but does harbor separatist movements, the strongest of which is the [[Quebec sovereignty movement]] which seeks to create a nation-state that would encompass the majority of Canada's [[French-Canadian]] population. Two referendums have been held to decide this question, one in 1980 and the last one in 1995 being lost by the separatist side by a tiny margin. Less mainstream, smaller movements also exist in the western provinces, namely [[Alberta]], to protest what is seen as a domination by Quebec and Ontario of Canadian politics. [[Saskatchewan]] premier [[Roy Romanow]] had also considered separation from Canada if the 1995 Quebec independence referendum had succeeded; which would have led to the balkanisation of Canada.

[[Quebec]] has been the scene of a small but vociferous [[Partition of Quebec|partition movement]] from the part of [[English language|anglophone]] activist groups opposed to the idea of [[Independence of Quebec]], as such a country would be dominated by francophones on the order of 80%. One such project is the [[Proposal for the Province of Montreal]], which wishes for the establishment of a separate province from Quebec from Montreal's strongly anglophone and immigrant communities.

In January 2007, regarding the growing support for [[Scottish independence]], the then-[[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] of the [[United Kingdom]], and later Prime Minister, [[Gordon Brown]] talked of a "Balkanisation of Britain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=13 January 2007|title=UK's Existence is at Risk – Brown |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6258089.stm |work=BBC News |access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independence movements within Great Britain also exist in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], and [[Northern Ireland]].

==Balkanization in Africa==
As Bates, Chatsworth &amp; Williamson would argue, Balkanization was observed to a great extent in Africa. During the 1960s, countries in the [[Communauté Financière Africaine]] started to opt for "autonomy within the French community" in this post-colonial era.

Countries within the CFA zone were allowed to impose tariffs, regulate trade and manage transport services. Zambia, Malawi, Uganda and Tanzania achieved independence in the post-colonial era. This period also saw the break down of the Federation of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland as well as the East African High Commission. Balkanization was a result of the movement towards a closed economy. Countries were adopting antitrade and anti-market policies. Tariff rates were 15% higher than OECD countries during the 1970s and 1980s.{{sfn|Bates|Coatsworth|Williamson|2007}} Furthermore, countries took approaches to subsidize their own local industries yet the market within the country was small-scale. Transport networks were fragmented; regulations on labor and capital flow were more regulated; prices were under control. Between 1960 and 1990, balkanisation led to disastrous results. The GDP of these regions were one-tenth of OECD countries.{{sfn|Bates|Coatsworth|Williamson|2007}} Balkanisation also resulted in what van de Valle called "typically fairly overvalued exchanged rates" in Africa. Balkanization contributed to what Bates, Chatsworth &amp; Williamson claimed to be a lost decade in Africa.

Economic situations only took a turn during the mid-1990s. Countries within the region started to input more stabilization policies. What was originally a high exchange rate eventually fell to a more reasonable exchange rate after devaluations in 1994. Eighteen countries had an exchange rate 50% higher than the official exchange rate, by 1994, the number of countries that had such exchange rate was decreased to four.{{sfn|Van de Walle|2004}} However, there is still limited progress in improving trade policies within the region according to van de Walle. In addition, the post-independent countries still rely heavily on donors for development plans. Balkanization still has an impact on today's Africa.

'''Charlene Polio''' (born 1961) is a Professor and Associate chair in the Department of Linguistics and Germanic, Slavic, Asian and African Languages at the [[Michigan State University]], [[The United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polio.msu.domains/|title=Michigan State University|date=3 October 2018|publisher=Polio.msu.domains}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research focuses on [[second language acquisition]] with a special focus on [[second language writing]]. 
Along with [[Alister Cumming|Cumming]], [[Ken Hyland|Hyland]], [[Judit Kormos|Kormos]], [[Paul Kei Matsuda|Matsuda]], [[Rosa Manchón|Manchón]], [[Lourdes Ortega|Ortega]], [[Neomy Storch|Storch]] and [[Marjolijn Verspoor|Verspoor]], Polio is considered as one of the most prominent researchers on second language writing.{{By whom|date=October 2018}}

== Career ==
Polio obtained her [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Linguistics]] in 1983 and her her [[Master of Arts]] degree in [[Teaching English to speakers of other languages|TESOL]] in 1984 at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  In 1992 she obtained her [[PhD]] in [[Applied linguistics]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polio.msu.domains/education/|title=Polio - Education|date=3 October 2018|publisher=Polio.msu.domains}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polio was the co-editor of [[The Modern Language Journal|T''he Modern Language Journal'']]''.''
She is  co-editor of [[TESOL Quarterly|''TESOL Quarterly'']] along with Peter De Costa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tesol.org/read-and-publish/journals/tesol-quarterly|title=TESOL Quarterly Editorial Board|date=3 October 2018|publisher=Tesol.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/15457249/homepage/editorialboard.html|title=TESOL Quarterly Editorial Board|date=3 October 2018|publisher=Onlinelibrary.wiley.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since April 2018 she has been a member-at-large of the [[American Association for Applied Linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaal.org/members/charlene-polio|title=Charlene Polio - American Association for Applied Linguistics|date=3 October 2018|publisher=Aaal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Polio's research focuses on second language writing with a special focus on [[language complexity]]. She is noted for her research synthesis on accuracy measures, published in [[Language Learning (journal)|Language Learning]] in 1997. She identified three different types of accuracy measures: (1) holistic scores, (2) error-free units, and (3) error counts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0023-8333.31997003|title=Charlene Polio (1997).

== Musical keyboards ==

In music, more than one key are pressed at a time to achieve more complex sounds, or [[chord (music)|chords]].

== Computer keyboards ==

Chording, with a [[chorded keyboard]] or [[keyer]] allows one to produce as many characters, as a [[QWERTY keyboard]], but with fewer keys and less motion per finger, and is thought to alleviate{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} or prevent{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} [[carpal tunnel syndrome]].

== Pointers ==

[[Mouse chording]] allows a user to use a two-button [[mouse (computing)|mouse]], [[trackball]], or [[touchpad]] as if it where a three-button device. For example, in the [[Unix]] graphical user interface (known as [[X11]]), the middle button is used to [[Cut, copy, and paste|paste text]]. Since Microsoft-type mice traditionally only had two buttons, users of Unix-type systems such as Linux and BSD ''chord'' the right and left buttons to paste text.

== Multitouch chording  ==
TipTapSpeech an application for the iPhone and iPad is a chord-based text entry solution for touch screen computing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiptapspeech.com TipTapSpeech] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215112154/http://tiptapspeech.com/ |date=2010-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[GKOS keyboard#Commercial devices|GKOS chording keyboard]] application development for iPhone was started on the GKOS Google Group &lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/gkos/browse_thread/thread/1f3e60a421bd7e67# GKOS Group]&lt;/ref&gt; on May 25, 2009. The application for iPhone became available on May 8, 2010, and a similar application for Android on October 3, 2010. Thumbs are used to press the keys that are located towards the sides of the screen, either a single key or two keys simultaneously. - The further development of GKOS has led to the '''ComboKey keyboard'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.combokey.plus ComboKey Plus]&lt;/ref&gt; that works better on smartphones. [http://combokey.com ComboKey] also allows one-hand typing with the hand holding the device, generating combinations by occasional swipes to other keys.

[[Douglas Engelbart]], Cherif Algreatly, Valerie Landau, Robert Stephenson, Evan Schaffer, and Eric Matsuno filed a patent in 2010 for a chorded solution for multitouch screens.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

'''False Answer Supervision (FAS)''' refers to [[VoIP]] fraud, when A-party is incorrectly billed: billed duration is more than duration of actual telephone conversation. The FAS is usually performed by VoIP wholesalers in their softswitches for randomly selected calls. Adding a small amount of extra billed seconds for many calls means a big revenue for the VoIP wholesaler. Actually it means stealing of money from caller (A-party).

== Implementation of FAS ==
The FAS fraud can be implemented in a [[softswitch]] in many different ways.&lt;ref name="startrinity-fas"&gt;{{cite web
 | url         = http://startrinity.com/VoIP/CallXml/Scripts/FalseAnswerSupervision.aspx
 | title       = FAS types: detection, generation in a softswitch
 | date        = 2016-08-06
 | publisher   = StarTrinity
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here are few of them:
# False billing of A-party without calling B-party. Usually a fake ringback tone, loopback audio or voicemail message is played
# Start of billing before actual answer of B-party
# Extra billing after disconnection of B-party

== Detection of FAS ==
The FAS can be detected and blocked in a [[softswitch]]. Common methods are:
# Manual verification of [[Call Detail Record]]s, listening to voice recordings
# Identification of FAS types and using algorithms to automatically detect the FAS
* RTP audio signal processing: detection of voice
* RTP audio signal processing: detection of silence
* RTP audio signal processing: detection of ringback tone

[[Image:Cloth flats.png|thumb|right|250 px|{{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} cloth-covered flats]]
A '''flat''' (short for '''scenery flat''') or '''coulisse''' is a flat piece of [[theatre|theatrical]] [[scenery]] which is painted and positioned on [[stage (theatre)|stage]] so as to give the appearance of buildings or other background.

Flats can be soft covered (covered with cloth such as [[muslin]]) or hard covered (covered with [[decorative plywood]] such as luan). Soft-covered flats have changed little from their origin in the Italian Renaissance. Flats with a frame that places the width of the lumber parallel to the face are called "Broadway" or "stage" flats. Hard-covered flats with a frame that is perpendicular to the paint surface are referred to as "Hollywood" or "studio" flats.

Usually flats are built in standard sizes of {{convert|8|ft|m|}}, {{convert|10|ft|m}}, or {{convert|12|ft|m}} tall so that walls or other scenery may easily be constructed, and so that flats may be stored and reused for subsequent productions.

Often affixed to [[batten (theater)|battens]] flown in from the [[fly tower]] or loft for the scenes in which they are used, they may also be stored at the sides of the stage, called wings, and [[brace (theatre)|braced]] to the floor when in use for an entire performance.

==Flat construction==

===Parts of a flat===
'''Rails''' (or '''plates''') are the top and bottom framing members of a flat.  Rails run the full width of the flat ({{convert|4|ft|disp=or}}, for a {{convert|4|×|8|ft|disp=or}}, flat).

'''Stiles''' (or '''studs''') are the vertical members of the frame.  The length of the stiles is the full height of the flat, minus the combined width of the rails ({{convert|7|ft|7|in|disp=or}}, for a {{convert|4|x|8|ft|disp=or}}, flat constructed of {{convert|2+1/2|in|adj=on|disp=or}}, rails).

'''Toggles''' are horizontal cross pieces that run between the stiles or studs.  The number and placement of toggles depends on the type of flat.  The length of the toggles is the total width of the flat minus the combined width of the stiles ({{convert|3|ft|7|in|disp=or}}, for a {{convert|4|x|8|ft|disp=or}}, soft-cover flat constructed of {{convert|2+1/2|in|disp=or}}, stiles).

'''Corner blocks''' are used to join the corners of a soft-cover flat.  They are normally made of {{convert|1/4|in|adj=on}} plywood, and are triangles with corners of 45°, 45°, and 90°.  They are most often made by ripping the plywood at {{convert|6+1/2|in}} and then mitering it at 45 degree angles to create triangles with {{convert|9|in|adj=on}} legs.

'''Keystones''' join the toggles to the stiles of soft-cover flats.  They are {{convert|8|in}} long, and normally rip sawn to the same width as the toggles (usually {{convert|2+3/4|in|disp=or}}) on one end, and {{convert|3+1/2|in}} on the other, forming a shape similar to the keystone of an archway.

'''Straps''' can be used in place of keystones.  They are {{convert|8|in}} long and {{convert|2+1/2|in}} wide (same as toggle) rectangles.  They are easier to construct than keystones, but not as strong due to their narrower dimension and reduced glue/nailing surface area.

A '''[[coffin lock]]''' or screws may be used to join securely adjacent flats, or traditionally with a '''lash line cleat''', where cotton sash cord is [[lashing (ropework)|lashed]] around cleats installed on the flat's edges. This allows for quick standing and striking of the set.

===Styles===
'''Broadway''' or '''stage''' flats are generally constructed of {{convert|1|×|3|in|adj=on}} nominal ({{convert|3/4|×|2+1/2|in|disp=or}} actual) pine boards. The boards are laid out flat on the shop floor, squared, and joined with the keystones and corner blocks. The keystones and corner blocks are inset {{convert|1|in}} from the outside edge, which allows for flats to be hinged or butted together. They are then glued in place, and stapled or screwed down. The flat can then be flipped over and covered with muslin or decorative plywood. Toggles in a Broadway flat are placed on {{convert|4|ft|abbr=on}} centers.

Broadway flats can also be constructed using [[Lap joint|Half-lap]] and [[Lap joint|Cross-lap]] joints instead of keystones and corner blocks, and joins stiles, rails, and toggles, by sawing a {{convert|3/8|in}} deep half-lap at the ends of the pieces, and/or a {{convert|3/8|in}} deep [[Dado (joinery)|dado groove]] mid-piece, which are then glued and stapled together. Dados can be made using a radial arm saw or table saw, and a [[Dado set|dado stack cutter]] (two outer circular saw blades and one or more "chippers" between them, giving a much wider cut). Setting up for a dado stack is approximately the same as for preparing keystones and cornerblocks, but requires less layout, as the length of stiles, rails and, toggles are equal to the face of your flat.

'''Hollywood''' or '''studio''' flats can be made in various thicknesses to suit a particular design, but are most often made of {{convert|1|×|3|in|adj=on}} nominal ({{convert|3/4|×|2+1/2|in|disp=comma}} actual) pine boards. The boards are laid out on edge on the shop floor, the ends are glued together and stapled or screwed. Keystones and corner blocks are not normally used. Once assembled, the flat can be covered with {{convert|1/4|in|adj=on}} or {{convert|1/8|in|adj=on}} decorative plywood, which is glued on and stapled. The toggles in a Hollywood flat are placed on {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=on}} centers.

Hollywood flats may receive a muslin skin over the decorative plywood face. The face is covered in a mixture of water and white glue, the muslin is applied and the entire flat is covered with the water/glue mixture again, to shrink and attach the muslin.

[[File:Hadwiger covering.svg|thumb|300px|A triangle can be covered by three smaller copies of itself; a square requires four smaller copies]]
{{unsolved|mathematics|Can every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional convex body be covered by &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; smaller copies of itself?}}
In [[combinatorial geometry]], the '''Hadwiger conjecture''' states that any [[convex body]] in ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] can be covered by 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; or fewer smaller bodies [[Homothetic transformation|homothetic]] with the original body, and that furthermore, the upper bound of 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is necessary [[if and only if|iff]] the body is a [[parallelepiped]]. There also exists an equivalent formulation in terms of the number of floodlights needed to illuminate the body.

The Hadwiger conjecture is named after [[Hugo Hadwiger]], who included it on a list of unsolved problems in 1957; it was, however, previously studied by {{harvtxt|Levi|1955}} and independently, {{harvtxt|Gohberg|Markus|1960}}. Additionally, there is a different [[Hadwiger conjecture (graph theory)|Hadwiger conjecture]] concerning [[graph coloring]]—and in some sources the geometric Hadwiger conjecture is also called the '''Levi–Hadwiger conjecture''' or the''' Hadwiger–Levi covering problem'''.

The conjecture remains unsolved even in three dimensions, though the two dimensional case was resolved by {{harvtxt|Levi|1955}}.

==Formal statement==
Formally, the Hadwiger conjecture is: If ''K'' is any [[bounded set|bounded]] [[convex set]] in the ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, then there exists a set of 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; [[Scalar multiplication|scalar]]s ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and a set of 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; [[Translation (geometry)|translation vector]]s ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; such that all ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; lie in the range 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;1, and 

: &lt;math&gt;K\subseteq\bigcup_{i=1}^{2^n} s_i K + v_i.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the upper bound is necessary iff ''K'' is a parallelepiped, in which case all 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; of the scalars may be chosen to be equal to 1/2.

===Alternate formulation with illumination===
As shown by [[Vladimir Boltyansky|Boltyansky]], the problem is equivalent to one of illumination: how many floodlights must be placed outside of an opaque convex body in order to completely illuminate its exterior? For the purposes of this problem, a body is only considered to be illuminated if for each point of the boundary of the body, there is at least one floodlight that is separated from the body by all of the [[tangent plane]]s intersecting the body on this point; thus, although the faces of a cube may be lit by only two floodlights, the planes tangent to its vertices and edges cause it to need many more lights in order for it to be fully illuminated. For any convex body, the number of floodlights needed to completely illuminate it turns out to equal the number of smaller copies of the body that are needed to cover it.&lt;ref name="BMP"/&gt;

==Examples==
As shown in the illustration, a triangle may be covered by three smaller copies of itself, and more generally in any dimension a [[simplex]] may be covered by ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 copies of itself, scaled by a factor of ''n''/(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1). However, covering a square by smaller squares (with parallel sides to the original) requires four smaller squares, as each one can cover only one of the larger square's four corners. In higher dimensions, covering a [[hypercube]] or more generally a [[parallelepiped]] by smaller homothetic copies of the same shape requires a separate copy for each of the [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the original hypercube or parallelepiped; because these shapes have 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; vertices, 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; smaller copies are necessary. This number is also sufficient: a cube or parallelepiped may be covered by 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; copies, scaled by a factor of 1/2. Hadwiger's conjecture is that parallelepipeds are the worst case for this problem, and that any other convex body may be covered by fewer than 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; smaller copies of itself.&lt;ref name="BMP"/&gt;

==Known results==
The two-dimensional case was settled by {{harvtxt|Levi|1955}}: every two-dimensional bounded convex set may be covered with four smaller copies of itself, with the fourth copy needed only in the case of parallelograms. However, the conjecture remains open in higher dimensions except for some special cases. The best known asymptotic upper bound on the number of smaller copies needed to cover a given body is
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 4^n (5n\ln n).&lt;/math&gt;
For small &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; the upper bound of &lt;math&gt;(n+1)n^{n-1}-(n-1)(n-2)^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; established by {{harvtxt|Lassak|1988}} is better than the asymptotic one. In three dimensions it is known that 16 copies always suffice, but this is still far from the conjectured bound of 8 copies.&lt;ref name="BMP"&gt;{{harvtxt|Brass|Moser|Pach|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conjecture is known to hold for certain special classes of convex bodies, including symmetric polyhedra and [[Surface of constant width|bodies of constant width]] in three dimensions.&lt;ref name="BMP"/&gt; The number of copies needed to cover any [[zonotope]] is at most &lt;math&gt;(3/4)2^n&lt;/math&gt;, while for bodies with a smooth surface (that is, having a single tangent plane per boundary point), at most &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; smaller copies are needed to cover the body, as [[Friedrich Wilhelm Levi|Levi]] already proved.&lt;ref name="BMP"/&gt;

[[File:Digraphia in Hindustani.png|thumb|300px|Urdu (top) and Hindi (middle) along with [[English language|English]] (bottom) on a road sign in India]]
The '''Hindi–Urdu controversy''' is an ongoing dispute—dating back to the 19th century—regarding the status of [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]] as a single language, [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] (lit "of ''[[Hindustan]]''"), or as two [[Dialect|dialects]] of a single language, and the establishment of a single [[standard language]] in certain areas of [[North India]]. Although this debate was officially settled by a government order in 1950, declaring Hindi as the official language, some resistance remains. The present notion among some Muslims about this dispute is that [[Hindu]]s abandoned the Urdu language, whereas some Hindus claim that Urdu was artificially created during Muslim rule.&lt;ref name="Khan2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abdul Jamil Khan | title=Urdu/Hindi: an artificial divide | year = 2006 | publisher = Algora | isbn=978-0-87586-437-2 | pages=290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] is a literary [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of the Hindustani language, derived from the [[Khariboli dialect]] of the [[Hindi languages]]. A Persianized variant of Hindustani began to take shape during the [[Delhi Sultanate]] (1206–1526 AD) and [[Mughal Empire]] (1526–1858 AD) in [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name="National Council for Promotion of Urdu language 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urducouncil.nic.in/pers_pp/index.htm |title=A Historical Perspective of Urdu |publisher=National Council for Promotion of Urdu language |accessdate=2007-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611133436/http://www.urducouncil.nic.in/pers_pp/index.htm |archivedate=11 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=February 2017}} Urdu, along with English, became the first official language of [[British India]] in 1850.&lt;ref name="Coatsworth2015"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.overstock.com/Books-Movies-Music-Games/Global-Connections-Politics-Exchange-and-Social-Life-in-World-History-Hardcover/9911619/product.html#more|title=Global Connections: Politics, Exchange, and Social Life in World History|last=Coatsworth|first=John|publisher=Cambridge Univ Pr|year=2015|isbn=9780521761062|location=United States|pages=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Tariq Rahman|author-link=Tariq Rahman|date=2011|title=Urdu as the Language of Education in British India|url=http://www.nihcr.edu.pk/Latest_English_Journal/1.%20URDU%20AS%20THE%20LANGUAGE,%20Tariq%20Rahman%20FINAL.pdf|journal=Pakistan Journal of History and Culture|publisher=NIHCR|volume=32|issue=2|pages=1–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urdu was being written, spoken and translated to and from English in all courts, schools, official documents, and government institutes. Although the need to have a language for Hindus developed in the 1850s, the irrevocable momentum of the Hindi language movement occurred around 1880. Urdu is a name derived from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] word ''ordu'' (army) or ''orda''. When the [[Turco-Persian]] [[Mughals]] who invaded the Indian subcontinent made camps, the colloquial Persian spoken by the soldiers, known as the "language of the camp", or "''Zaban-i-Ordu''", became gradually more and more Indianised, as they themselves settled and married into the local communities, until the dialect they spoke was readily intelligible to the native Hindu population.

The last few decades of the nineteenth century witnessed the eruption of the Hindi–Urdu controversy in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] (present-day [[Uttar Pradesh]], then known as "the [[North-Western Provinces]] and [[Oudh]]"). The controversy comprised "Hindi" and "Urdu" protagonists each advocating the official use of Hindustani with the [[Devanagari]] script or with the [[Nastaʿlīq]] script, respectively. Hindi movements advocating the growth of and official status for Devanagari were established in Northern India. [[Babu Shiva Prasad]] and [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] were notable early proponents of this movement. This, consequently, led to the development of Urdu movements defending Urdu's official status; [[Syed Ahmed Khan]] was one of its noted advocates.

In 1900, the Government issued a decree granting symbolic equal status to both Hindi and Urdu, which was opposed by Muslims and received with jubilation by [[Hindu]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Hindi and Urdu started to diverge linguistically, with Hindi drawing on [[Sanskrit]] as the primary source for formal and academic vocabulary, often with a conscious attempt to purge the language of Persian-derived equivalents. Deploring this Hindu-Muslim divide, [[Gandhi]] proposed re-merging the standards, using either Devanagari or Urdu script, under the traditional generic term Hindustani. Bolstered by the support of the [[Indian National Congress]] and various leaders involved in the [[Indian Independence Movement]], Hindi, in the Devanagari script, along with English, replaced Urdu as the official language of India during the institution of the [[Indian constitution]] in 1950.

== Background ==
The main cause of this divide may be attributed to the aspirations of both communities (Hindu and Muslim) to spread their cultural views, which became open contention during [[Partition of India|Indian independence]]. Muslims have mostly looked towards their Muslim [[Ummah]] for cultural inspiration whereas Hindus generally get inspiration from the ancient cultures such as that of the [[Vedic]]. During the rule of Muslims in the subcontinent, often having been [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Afghans|Afghan]], a number of people who converted to [[Islam]] readily adopted aspects of the culture of the Turko-Afghan conquerors and rulers brought with them. [[Persian language|Persian]] at that time was considered a prestigious and important language in many parts of Islamic world like Central Asia, which they thus brought with them. The founders of Islamic rule in India were from different ethnic backgrounds viz. Turks, Mongols, Arabs, Iranians, Afghans, etc. and all of them used Persian as their lingua franca and court language. In general, from its earliest days foreign Muslim culture was imported and patronised in the subcontinent by Turks and Afghans, laying the firm basis for what would, eventually, develop further under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigfried J. de Laet. [https://books.google.nl/books?id=PvlthkbFU1UC&amp;pg=PA734&amp;dq=persian+language+in+anatolia&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMIs-fO2_aRxgIVygYsCh2NJgBM#v=onepage&amp;q=persian%20language%20in%20anatolia&amp;f=false ''History of Humanity: From the seventh to the sixteenth century''] UNESCO, 1994. {{ISBN|9231028138}} p 734&lt;/ref&gt; Hindus considered these things as an alien culture. With the passage of time things like [[Sanskrit]] language, [[Dhoti]], [[Ayurveda]] etc. came to be associated with Hindus, and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Persian, [[Chaghatai language|Chaghatai]], [[Yunani]] medicine with Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[[The New Cambridge History of India]], Volumes 3–5, page 180&lt;/ref&gt; There also came to be differences in the cuisine and culture of two communities.

As the Muslim rule spread in the northern subcontinent, Hindustani interacted with various vernaculars and introduced Persian and Arabic words into local languages and absorbed local vocabulary, and over a period of time developed into a distinct spoken language. Urdu in the Persian script became the language of the courts of Muslim rulers during the eighteenth century. It developed from the [[Khariboli]] dialect of the Delhi area with an infusion of words from [[Arabic]] and Persian. The modern vocabulary is derived from Persian, Arabic and Sanskrit, together with [[Prakrit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Maria Isabel Maldonado Garcia, Mustafa Yapici |title=Common Vocabulary in Urdu and Turkish Languages. A Case of Historical Onomasiology |year=2014 |publisher=Journal of Pakistan Vision |pages=193–225 |volume=15|issue=1 |url=http://pu.edu.pk/images/journal/studies/PDF-FILES/Artical-10_v15_no1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hindi also developed from Khariboli, albeit with the assimilation of words from local languages and Sanskrit, and a smaller component of Arabic and Persian words.

Several factors contributed to the increasing divergence of Hindi and Urdu. The Muslim rulers chose to write Hindustani in Perso-Arabic script instead of [[Devanagari]] script. In time, Hindustani written in Perso-Arabic script also became a [[literary language]] with an increasing body of literature written in the 18th and 19th century. A division developed gradually between Hindus who chose to write Hindustani in Devanagari script and Muslims and some Hindus who chose to write the same in Urdu script. The development of Hindi movements in the late nineteenth century further contributed to this divergence.&lt;ref name="Paul R. Brass"/&gt;

[[Sumit Sarkar]] notes that in the 18th and the bulk of the 19th century, "Urdu had been the language of polite culture over a big part of north India, for Hindus quite as much as Muslims". For the decade of 1881-90, Sarkar gives figures which showed that the circulation of Urdu newspapers was twice that of Hindi newspapers and there were 55% more Urdu books as Hindi books. He gives the example of the author [[Premchand]] who wrote mainly in Urdu till 1915, until he found it difficult to publish in the language.&lt;ref name="Sarkar1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sumit Sarkar|title=Modern India, 1885-1947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x1uBQgAACAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-333-90425-1|pages=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Paul R. Brass]] notes in his book, ''Language, Religion and Politics in North India'', {{quote|The Hindi-Urdu controversy by its very bitterness demonstrates how little the objective similarities between language groups matter when people attach subjective significance to their languages. Willingness to communicate through the same language is quite a different thing from the mere ability to communicate.&lt;ref name="Paul R. Brass"/&gt;}}

== Controversy ==

=== British language policy ===
{{Further|Persian language in South Asia}}
In 1837, the British East India company replaced Persian with local vernacular in various provinces as the official language of government offices and of the lower courts. However, in the northern regions of the Indian subcontinent, Urdu in [[Urdu script]] was chosen as the replacement for Persian, rather than [[Hindi]] in the [[Devanagari]] script.&lt;ref name="Paul R. Brass"&gt;Language, Religion and Politics in North India by Paul R. Brass, Publisher: iUniverse, Incorporated, {{ISBN|978-0-595-34394-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The political awakening in India| edition=| author=John R. McLane| year=1970| pages=105| publisher=Prentice-Hall. Inc, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey| isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done despite the fact that the great majority of people in the northern plains of India were Hindu with an affinity for Hindi and for the Devanagri script. Why exactly this decision was taken is unclear.

The most immediate reason for the controversy is believed to be the contradictory language policy in North India in the 1860s. Although the then government encouraged both Hindi and Urdu as a medium of education in school, it discouraged Hindi or Nagari script for official purposes. This policy gave rise to conflict between students educated in Hindi or Urdu for the competition of government jobs, which eventually took on a communal form.&lt;ref name="Kenneth W. Jones"&gt;Religious Controversy in British India by Kenneth W. Jones, p124, {{ISBN|0-7914-0827-2}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=EmY9fsUTjwYC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=hindi+urdu+controversy#PPA124,M1 Google book]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hindi and Urdu movements ===
{{See also|Urdu movement}}
In 1867, some Hindus in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh]] during the [[British Raj]] in [[India]] began to demand that [[Hindi]] be made an official language in place of [[Urdu]].&lt;ref name = "PK"&gt;[http://www.storyofpakistan.com/articletext.asp?artid=A133 Urdu-Hindi Controversy], from [http://www.storyofpakistan.com/  Story of Pakistan].&lt;/ref&gt;  Babu Shiva Prasad of Banares was one of the early proponents of the Nagari script. In a ''Memorandum on court characters'' written in 1868, he accused the early Muslim rulers of India for forcing them to learn Persian. In 1897, [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] published a collection of documents and statements titled ''Court character and primary education in North Western Provinces and Oudh'', in which, he made a compelling case for Hindi.&lt;ref name="Kenneth W. Jones"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ulrich Ammon, Marlis Hellinger"&gt;Status Change of Languages by Ulrich Ammon, Marlis Hellinger&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Hindi movements were formed in the late 19th and early 20th century; notable among them were [[Nagari Pracharini Sabha]] formed in [[Banaras]] in 1893, Hindi Sahitya Sammelan in [[Allahabad]] in 1910, Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha in 1918 and Rashtra Bhasha Prachar Samiti in 1926.&lt;ref name="Ulrich Ammon, Marlis Hellinger"/&gt; The movement was encouraged in 1881 when Hindi in Devanagari script replaced Urdu in Persian script as the official language in neighboring [[Bihar]]. They submitted 118 memorials signed by 67,000 people to the Education Commission in several cities.&lt;ref name="Paul R. Brass"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ulrich Ammon, Marlis Hellinger"/&gt; The proponents of Hindi argued that the majority of people spoke Hindi and therefore introduction of Nagari script would provide better education and improve prospects for holding Government positions. They also argued that Urdu script made court documents illegible, encouraged forgery and promoted the use of complex Arabic and Persian words.

Organisations such as [[Anjuman Taraqqi-e-Urdu]] were formed for the advocacy of Urdu.&lt;ref name="Paul R. Brass"/&gt; Advocates of Urdu argued that Hindi scripts could not be written faster, and lacked standardisation and vocabulary. They also argued that the Urdu language originated in India, asserted that Urdu could also be spoken fluently by most of the people and disputed the assertion that official status of language and script is essential for the spread of education.

Communal violence broke out as the issue was taken up by firebrands. [[Syed Ahmed Khan|Sir Syed Ahmed Khan]] had once stated, "I look to both Hindus and Muslims with the same eyes &amp; consider them as two eyes of a bride. By the word nation I only mean Hindus and Muslims and nothing else.  We Hindus and Muslims live together under the same soil under the same government. Our interest and problems are common and therefore I consider the two factions as one nation."  Speaking to Mr. Shakespeare, the governor of [[Varanasi|Banaras]], after the language controversy heated up, he said "I am now convinced that the Hindus and Muslims could never become one nation as their religion and way of life was quite distinct from one another."

In the last three decades of the 19th century the controversy flared up several times in [[North-Western Provinces|North-Western provinces]] and [[Oudh]]. The Hunter commission, appointed by the Government of India to review the progress of education, was used by the advocates of both Hindi and Urdu for their respective causes.

=== Gandhi's idea of Hindustani ===
Hindi and Urdu continued to diverge both linguistically and culturally. Linguistically, Hindi continued drawing words from Sanskrit, and Urdu from Persian, Arabic and [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]]. Culturally Urdu came to be identified with Muslims and Hindi with Hindus.  This wide divergence in the 1920s was deplored by [[Gandhi]] who exhorted the re-merging of both Hindi and Urdu naming it Hindustani written in both Nagari and Persian scripts.&lt;ref name="Paul R. Brass"/&gt;  Though he failed in his attempt to bring together Hindi and Urdu under the Hindustani banner, he popularised Hindustani in other non-Hindustani speaking areas.&lt;ref name="Ulrich Ammon, Marlis Hellinger"/&gt;

=== Muslim nationalism ===
It has been argued that the Hindi–Urdu controversy sowed the seeds for [[Muslim nationalism in India]]. Some also argued that Syed Ahmad had expressed separatist views long before the controversy developed.&lt;ref name="Paul R. Brass"/&gt;

=== Linguistic purism ===

Because of linguistic purism and its orientation towards the pre-Islamic past, Hindi and especially its standard literary form has removed many Persian, Arabic and Turkic loanwords and replaced them with borrowings from Sanskrit (that is, from its own ancestral form). Conversely, Urdu retains the Perso-Arabic words that were introduced into the Khariboli dialect during Muslim rule and in formal settings employs far more Perso-Arabic words than in vernacular Khariboli.

== Hindi to Urdu ==
In April 1900, the colonial Government of the North-Western Provinces issued an order granting equal official status to both [[Nagari]] and [[Perso-Arabic]] scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Christopher R. King |title=One language, two scripts |year=1994 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=155 |chapter=Chapter V: The Hindi-Nagari movement |chapterurl=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00urduhindilinks/king/05_chapter.pdf |isbn=0-19-563565-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decree evoked protests from Urdu supporters and joy from Hindi supporters. However, the order was more symbolic in that it did not provision exclusive use of Nagari script. Perso-Arabic remained dominant in North-Western provinces and [[Oudh]] as the preferred writing system until independence.&lt;ref name="Kenneth W. Jones"/&gt;

[[C. Rajagopalachari]], chief minister of [[Madras Presidency]] introduced Hindi as a compulsory language in secondary school education though he later relented and opposed the introduction of Hindi during the Madras anti-Hindi agitation of 1965.&lt;ref name="indiatoday"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tongue tied|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/Tongue+tied/1/2692.html|first=A. R.|last=Venkatachalapathy|work=[[India Today]]|date=December 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] supported Devanagari script as the essential part of nationalist movement. The language policy of Congress and the [[Indian independence movement|independence movement]] paved its status as an alternative [[Official languages of India|official language of independent India]]. Hindi was supported by religious and political leaders, social reformers, writers and intellectuals during independence movement securing that status. Hindi, along with English, was recognised as the official language of India during the institution of the [[Indian constitution]] in 1950.&lt;ref name="Ulrich Ammon, Marlis Hellinger"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1807">The '''javelin argument''', credited to [[Lucretius]], is an ancient [[logical argument]] that the [[universe]], or [[cosmology|cosmological]] [[space]], must be infinite: 

:As to space, I need but ask you, how can that be bounded? For whatever bounds, it that thing must itself be bounded likewise; and to this bounding thing there must be a bound again, and so on for ever and ever throughout all immensity. Suppose, however, for a moment, all existing space to be bounded, and that a man runs forward to the uttermost borders, and stands upon the last verge of things, and then hurls forward a winged javelin,&amp;mdash; suppose you that the dart, when hurled by the vivid force, shall take its way to the point the darter aimed at, or that something will take its stand in the path of its flight, and arrest it? For one or other of these things must happen. There is a dilemma here that you never can escape from.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GyQgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA86 Google Books result]: [[William Hurrell Mallock|W. H. Mallock]], ''[[Lucretius]]''. John B. Alden:New York, 1883. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument was used to support the [[Epicurean]] thesis about the universe.

However, the argument assumes incorrectly that a finite universe must necessarily have a "limit" or edge. The argument fails in the case that [[shape of the universe|the universe might be shaped]] like the surface of a [[hypersphere]] or [[torus]]. (Consider a similar fallacious argument that the Earth's surface must be infinite in area: because otherwise one could go to the Earth's edge and throw a javelin, proving that the Earth's surface continued wherever the javelin hit the ground.)

The '''Jingpho-Luish''', '''Jingpho-Asakian''', '''Kachin–Luic''', or '''Kachinic''' languages are a group of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] belonging the [[Sal languages|Sal branch]]. They are spoken in eastern India and Burma, and consist of the [[Jingpho language|Jingpho]] (also known as Kachin) language and the [[Luish languages|Luish]] ({{aka}} Asakian) languages [[Sak language|Sak]], [[Kadu language (Burma)|Kadu]], [[Ganan language|Ganan]], [[Andro language|Andro]], [[Sengmai language|Sengmai]], and [[Chairel language|Chairel]].

'''Kate Roberts''' (13 February 1891 – 4 April 1985) was one of the foremost [[Welsh language|Welsh-language]] authors of the 20th century. Styled ''Brenhines ein llên'' (The Queen of our Literature), she is known mainly for her [[short stories]], but also wrote novels. Roberts was a prominent [[Welsh nationalism|Welsh nationalist]].&lt;ref&gt;*[[Derec Llwyd Morgan|Morgan, Derec Llwyd]] (1991), ''Kate Roberts''. Writers of Wales series. Cardiff: University of Wales Press. {{ISBN|0-7083-1115-6}}. An introduction to her work in English.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Roberts was born in the village of [[Rhosgadfan]], [[Caernarfonshire]] ([[Gwynedd]] today), where her father (Owen Roberts) was a quarryman in the local [[Slate industry in Wales|slate industry]]. She graduated in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] at the [[University of Wales, Bangor|University College of North Wales, Bangor]], and trained as a teacher. She taught in various schools in south Wales.

Roberts met Morris T. Williams at [[Plaid Cymru]] (the Welsh nationalist party) meetings, and married him in 1928. Williams was a printer, and eventually they bought the printing and publishing house [[Gwasg Gee]] (The Gee Press), [[Denbigh]], and moved to live in the town in 1935. The press published books, pamphlets and the [[Welsh language|Welsh-language]] weekly ''Y Faner'' (The Banner), for which Roberts wrote regularly. After her husband's death in 1946, she carried on working at the press for another ten years.

She remained in [[Denbigh]] after her retirement and died in 1985. [[Alan Llwyd]]'s 2011 biography of Roberts used diaries and letters to shed fresh light on her private life and her relationship with Morris.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Llwyd, ''Kate: Y Cofiant'' (Y Lolfa, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Cae'r Gors, the quarryman's cottage in which Roberts was born and brought up, has been taken into the care of [[Cadw]] and turned into a museum open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Dylan Iorwerth, "Cadw's new quarry cottage", ''Heritage in Wales'', Issue 54, Spring 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
It was the death of her brother in the First World War that led Roberts to writing. She used her literary work as a means of coming to terms with her loss.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Her first volume of short stories, ''O gors y bryniau (From the Swamp of the Hills)'', appeared in 1925. Perhaps her most successful book of short stories is ''[[Te yn y grug]] (Tea in the Heather)'' (1959), a series about children. Of the novels that Roberts wrote, perhaps the most famous was ''Traed mewn cyffion (Feet in Chains)'' (1936), which reflected the hard life of a slate-quarrying family. In 1960 she published ''Y lôn wen'', a volume of autobiography.

Most of her novels and short stories are set in the region where she lived in North Wales. She herself said that she derived the material for her work "from the society in which I was brought up, a poor society in an age of poverty... it was always a struggle against poverty. But notice that the characters haven't reached the bottom of that poverty, they are struggling against it, afraid of it."

Thus her work deals with the uneventful lives of humble people and how they deal with difficulties and disillusionments. It is remarkable for the richness of her language and for her perception. The role of women in society and progressive ideas about life and love are major themes.

Roberts also struck up a literary relationship with [[Saunders Lewis]], which they maintained through letters over a period of forty years. These letters give a picture of life in Wales during the period and the comments of these two literary giants on events at home and abroad.

Many of her works have been translated into other languages.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

'''Kiong Nai''' (or '''Jiongnai''', {{zh|炯奈}} ''jiǒngnài'') is a divergent [[Hmongic languages|Hmongic (Miao)]] language spoken in [[Jinxiu County]], [[Guangxi]], [[China]]. The speakers' [[Endonym|autonym]] is pronounced {{IPA|[kjɔŋ33 nai33]}} or {{IPA|[kjaŋ31 nɛ31]}}; ''kjɔŋ33'' means 'mountain', while ''nai33'' means 'people' (Meng 2001:1). Mao &amp; Li (2002) believe it to be most closely related to [[She language|She]].

==Dialects==
Mao &amp; Li (2002) divide Jiongnai into two major dialects.

*'''Longhua 龙华''', spoken in Longhua 龙华村 of Changdong Township 长垌乡
*'''Liuxiang 六巷''', spoken in Liuxiang Township 六巷乡

Jiongnai is spoken in the following villages in 3 townships of [[Jinxiu Yao Autonomous County]], Guangxi (Mao &amp; Li 2002:1).

'''Lango''' (or '''Langgo''') is an [[Eastern Nilotic languages|Eastern Nilotic]] language spoken an estimated 38,000 people in [[South Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/language/lno|title = Lango|date = 2014|accessdate = 11 Jan 2015|website = Ethnologue 17|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
Lango is listed as a member of the Eastern Nilotic branch of Nilotic, in the Eastern Sudanic sub-grouping of [[Nilo-Saharan]]. Within Eastern Nilotic, Lango is considered part of the Lotuko language group, in the Lotuko-Maa branch of Teso-Lotuko-Maa (also referred to as the non-Bari languages).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/language/lno|title = Lango|date = 2014|accessdate = 11 Jan 2015|website = Ethnologue 17|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other members of the Lotuko language group include [[Lotuko language|Lotuko]], [[Lopit language|Lopit]], [[Dongotono language|Dongotono]] and [[Lokoya language|Lokoya]], all spoken in nearby regions of in [[South Sudan]].

There has been virtually no description of the Lango language, and its relationship to other languages in the Lotuko cluster is unclear, as are the relationships between different dialects of Lango. Five Lango dialects are listed in the Ethnologue: Ketebo, Logir, Logire (Imotong), Lokwaa, Madial Lorwama (Okolie). However, it is also noted that "It is uncertain whether or not the dialects are separate languages".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/language/lno|title = Lango|date = 2014|accessdate = 11 Jan 2015|website = Ethnologue 17|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic distribution ==
The Lango language is spoken by the [[Lango people]], who live in mountainous areas of [[Ikotos County]] in [[Eastern Equatoria State]], [[South Sudan]]. According to the Ethnologue, the Lorwama variety is spoken in Losite payam, Lofos and Lotome; the Logir variety is spoken in Ikotos and Lomohidong payams, Kidepo and Ludwera; the Logire (Imatong) variety is spoken in Ikotos payam between Ikotos and Chukudum; the Lokwaa variety is spoken in Kikire and Ikotos, and the Ketebo variety is spoken in Losite payam, Bira.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/language/lno|title = Lango|date = 2014|accessdate = 11 Jan 2015|website = Ethnologue 17|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar ==
Limited data is available on the Lango language, but Muratori (1938) notes that Lango lexical items appear to be more similar to Lokoya than Lotuko, but that Lango appears to be phonetically and grammatically more similar to Lotuko.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Grammatica Lotuxo|last = Muratori|first = Carlo|publisher = Missioni Africane|year = 1938|isbn = |location = Verona|pages = xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that Lango shares many traits common to other languages in the Lotuko cluster and in Eastern Nilotic more generally, such as [[Verb-Subject-Object]] word order, two morphological verb classes, masculine and feminine grammatical gender for nouns, and a highly irregular number marking system involving a range of morphemes to mark singular, singulative, and plural. In terms of phonology, Lango is likely to have the [[Advanced and retracted tongue root|Advanced Tongue Root]] contrast noted for closely related languages, and a consonant inventory including plosives at four or five places of articulation, with a voicing contrast at most of these.

In his 1938 grammar of the Lotuko language, Muratori includes a short fable for many of the languages related to Lotuko, including Lango. No direct translation is provided for the Lango story, but it is about a racing competition between a hyena and a frog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Grammatica Lotuxo|last = Muratori|first = Carlo|publisher = Missioni Africane|year = 1938|isbn = |location = Verona|pages = 472–473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The languages of [[Austria]]''' include [[German language|German]], the official language and ''[[lingua franca]]''; [[Austro-Bavarian]], the main dialect outside Vorarlberg; [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]], the main dialect in Vorarlberg; and several minority languages.

==German==
German is the national official language and constitutes a ''[[lingua franca]]'' and ''[[de facto]]'' second language: most Austrians other than (mostly rural) seniors are able to speak it. It is the language used in media, in schools, and formal announcements. The variety of German used, [[Austrian German]], is partially influenced by Austro-Bavarian and uses many "Germanized" words.

==Alemannic==
Alemannic is spoken in [[Vorarlberg]]. Vorarlberg uses a [[High Alemannic German|High Alemannic]], the same dialect group as that spoken in Northern Switzerland (outside Basel) and parts of southern Alsace, France. To most Germans and Austrians outside of Vorarlberg it is very difficult to understand, as it is more similar to Swiss German, with many grammatical and pronunciation differences.

==Austro-Bavarian==
The main native language of Austria outside Vorarlberg is Austro-Bavarian, whose many regionally different dialects are spoken. The north-eastern parts of Austria (with the capital [[Vienna]]) speak [[Central Austro-Bavarian]] dialects and the southern parts [[Southern Austro-Bavarian]] dialects. Austro-Bavarian differs a lot from Standard German, making it very difficult for German speakers of different regions to understand the native population. Austro-Bavarian has no official orthography, but there are literary efforts ([[:de:Dialektliteratur]]), especially in poems, to depict the sound of the pronunciation in the spelling. Other words can only be heard while visiting particular regions of Austria and Bavaria that are only rarely used in Standard German, including "Griaß God" (literally: "greet god" = may god greet you), and "Servus/Servas" (at your service) as greeting phrases, or are denoted as strictly dialectal, like "Pfiat di" (literally: "watch over you [god]" = may God watch over you) with the meaning of "goodbye". This particular example also shows that the Austro-Bavarian grammar differs from Standard German.

==Minority languages==
A number of minority languages are spoken in Austria, some of which have official status.

===Turkish===
[[Turkish language|Turkish]] is the largest minority language, in a situation mirroring that of [[Germany]], spoken by 2.3% of the population.

===Serbian===
[[Serbian language|Serbian]] is the second largest minority language, with usage by 2.2% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik.at/web_de/statistiken/bevoelkerung/volkszaehlungen_registerzaehlungen/bevoelkerung_nach_demographischen_merkmalen/022896.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20100123145736/http://www.statistik.at/web_de/statistiken/bevoelkerung/volkszaehlungen_registerzaehlungen/bevoelkerung_nach_demographischen_merkmalen/022896.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 23, 2010 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burgenland Croatian===
Burgenland Croatian, an official language in [[Burgenland]], is spoken by 2.5% of Austrians, and [[Burgenland Croats]] are recognized as a minority and have enjoyed special rights following the [[Austrian State Treaty]] (''Staatsvertrag'') of 1955.

===Hungarian===
[[Image:Map_at_carinthia_municipalities_(Slovenes).png|thumb|right|300px|Areas in Carinthia where Slovene is spoken by above 5% (light-blue) to above 30% (dark-blue) of the population.]]
While little spoken today, Hungarian has traditionally held an important position in Austria (or, more correctly, [[Austria-Hungary]]). Today, Hungarian is spoken by around 1,000 people in Burgenland.

===Slovene===
[[Slovene language|Slovene]] is an official language in [[Carinthia]]. {{As of|2001|pre=the census in }} Slovene is used by 12,686 Austrians as vernacular, and it is reported that Slovene can be spoken by 0.3% of Austrians. [[Carinthian Slovenes]] are recognized as a minority and have enjoyed special rights and affirmative action following the Austrian State Treaty (''Staatsvertrag'') of 1955.

==European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages==

Austria ratified the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] on 28 June 2001 for the following languages in respect of specific [[States of Austria|Länder]]:

* [[Croatian language|Croatian]] of [[Burgenland]]
* [[Slovene language|Slovene]] (in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and [[Styria]])
* [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (in Burgenland and [[Vienna]])
* [[Czech language|Czech]] (in Vienna)
* [[Slovak language|Slovak]] (in Vienna)
* [[Romani language|Romani]] (in Burgenland)

The [[official language]]s of the [[Republic of Cyprus]] are [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus|year=1960|url=http://www.presidency.gov.cy/presidency/presidency.nsf/all/1003AEDD83EED9C7C225756F0023C6AD/$file/CY_Constitution.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|art. 3, § 1}} In [[Northern Cyprus]], Turkish was made the only official language by the 1983 constitution.&lt;ref name="Euromosaic" /&gt;{{rp|4.5}} The everyday spoken language ([[vernacular]]) of the majority of the population is [[Cypriot Greek]], and that of [[Turkish Cypriots]] is [[Cypriot Turkish]]. For official purposes, the [[standard language]]s ([[Standard Modern Greek]] and Standard Turkish) are used.

Three "religious groups" are recognised by the constitution; two have their own language: [[Armenian language|Armenian]] (the language of [[Armenians in Cyprus|Armenian Cypriots]]) and [[Cypriot Arabic]] (the language of [[Maronites in Cyprus|Maronite Cypriots]]). Sometimes ''[[Kurbetcha]]'', the language of the ''Kurbet'', the Cypriot Roma, is included alongside the other two in literature, but it is not officially recognised in any capacity.&lt;ref name="Hadjioannou Tsiplakou Kappler 2011" /&gt;

The 2011 census of the Republic recorded 679,883 native speakers of Greek, 34,814 of English, 24,270 of Romanian, 20,984 of Russian and 18,388 of Bulgarian of a total of 840,407. Following the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|1974 Turkish invasion]], Cyprus was effectively divided into two linguistically near-homogeneous areas: the Turkish-speaking north and the Greek-speaking south;&lt;ref name="Euromosaic" /&gt;{{rp|2.2}} only 1,405 speakers of Turkish reside in territory controlled by the Republic.&lt;ref name="Census 2011"&gt;{{cite book|date=June 2013|title=Population enumerated by age, sex, language spoken and district (1.10.2011) (sheet D1A)|booktitle=Population – Country of Birth, Citizenship Category, Country of Citizenship, Language, 2011|publisher=CYstat|url=http://www.mof.gov.cy/mof/cystat/statistics.nsf/All/8B96E149FE049F49C2257AD90055559F/$file/POP_CEN_11-POP_FOREIGN_LANG-EN-140613.xls?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The languages of Cyprus have historically exerted influence on one another; Cypriot Greek and Cypriot Turkish [[loanword|borrowed]] heavily from each other, and Cypriot Greek has helped shape Cypriot Arabic's phonology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Greek in Turkish Cypriot Literature|last1=Gökçeoğlu|first=Mustafa|last2=Pehlivan|first2=Ahmet|year=2006|pages=83–92|booktitle=Intercultural Aspects in and Around Turkic Literatures; Proceedings of the international conference held on October 11–12th, 2003 in Nicosia|editor-last=Kappler|editor-first=Matthias|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Km2NRLazqDYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84}}&lt;ref name="Borg 1997" /&gt;{{rp|223}}

==Cypriot Greek==
Greek was originally brought to Cyprus by Greek settlers in the 12th–11th century BCE.&lt;ref name="Euromosaic" /&gt;{{rp|2.1}} The earliest known Cypriot Greek inscription dates to c. 1000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britac.ac.uk/sites/default/files/BAR24-16-Steele.pdf Steele Philippa, "The mystery of ancient Cypriot clay balls", British Academy Review, 24, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary [[Cypriot Greek]] (CG)—the mother tongue of [[Greek Cypriots]]—evolved from later [[Byzantine Greek|Byzantine Koine]], under the influence of the languages of the many colonisers of the island. CG differs markedly from [[Standard Modern Greek]] (SMG),&lt;ref name="Joseph Tserdanelis 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joseph|first1=Brian D.|last2=Tserdanelis|first2=Georgios|chapter=Modern Greek|title=Variationstypologie.

SMG has been the language of instruction in Greek Cypriot education since the late 19th century (then [[Katharevousa]]) and is the language used in Greek-language media in the country (though in a recognisably Cypriot form).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arvaniti|first=Amalia|year=2010|journal=Mediterranean Language Review|volume=17|pages=15–45|title=Linguistic practices in Cyprus and the emergence of Cypriot Standard Greek|url=http://www.kent.ac.uk/secl/ell/staff/amalia-arvaniti/docs/Linguistic%20%20practices%20in%20Cyprus%20and%20the%20%20emergence%20of%20Cypriot%20Standard%20Greek.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Greek Cypriots are [[diglossia|diglossic]], with SMG the high (taught) and CG the low variety (naturally acquired), itself a [[dialect continuum]] that has been long undergoing [[dialect levelling|levelling]] and [[koiné language|koinénisation]]. SMG exerts a continuing influence on CG, and CG speakers [[code-mixing|code-mix]] and [[code-switch]] between the two varieties in formal settings. Greek Cypriots' tendency to "downplay the differences between the two varieties"&lt;ref name="Arvaniti 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arvaniti|first=Amalia|year=2006|title=Erasure as a means of maintaining diglossia in Cyprus|journal=San Diego Linguistic Papers|issue=2|publisher=Department of Linguistics, UC San Diego|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/4q90b3fm}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}} has been thought to help preserve diglossia in circumstances that would have otherwise led to the demise of the low variety (CG).&lt;ref name="Hadjioannou Tsiplakou Kappler 2011" /&gt;{{rp|534–535}}&lt;ref name="Ammon et al. 2006" /&gt;{{rp|1887}}

Many [[Turkish Cypriots]] have traditionally (prior to [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|1974]]) been fluent in CG, meaning CG served as the "[[vernacular]] [[lingua franca]]" of the island.&lt;ref name="Ammon et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Ammon|editor1-first=Ulrich|editor2-last=Dittmar|editor2-first=Norbert|editor3-last=Mattheier|editor3-first=Klaus J.|editor4-last=Trudgill|editor4-first=Peter|chapter=Greece and Cyprus|pages=1881–1889|title=Sociolinguistics: an international handbook of the science of language and society / Soziolinguistik: ein internationales Handbuch zur Wissenschaft von Sprache und Gesellschaft|year=2006|edition=2nd|series=Handbooks of linguistics and communication science / Handbücher zur Sprach- und Kommunikationswissenschaft|volume=3|location=Berlin|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMZm0w0k1c4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1886}} Some Turkish Cypriots were uni-lingual in Greek.{{sfn|Beckingham|1957|p=166|ps=:In Cyprus religious and linguistic divisions do not quite coincide. While many Turks habitually speak Turkish there are 'Turkish', that is, Muslim villages in which the normal language is Greek; among them are Lapithiou (P i), Platanisso (F i), Ayios Simeon (F i) and Galinoporni (F i). This fact has not yet been adequately investigated. With the growth of national feeling and the spread of education the phenomenon is becoming not only rarer but harder to detect. In a Muslim village the school teacher will be a Turk and will teach the children Turkish. They already think of themselves as Turks, and having once learnt the language, will sometimes use it in talking to a visitor in preference to Greek, merely as a matter of national pride. On the other hand many Turks, whose mother tongue is Turkish, learn Greek because they find it useful to understand the language of the majority, though it is much less common for them to write it correctly''}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.gr/books?id=r8wGkxXeZuUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=Greek-speaking%20Muslims&amp;f=false  Stavroula Varella, Language Contact and the Lexicon in the History of Cypriot Greek, Peter Lang, 2006, p. 64]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/19366/7/Guelle_Vasif_Ozan.pdf Ozan Gülle (2014), "Structural Convergence in Cyprus", Inauguraldussertation zur Erlangung des Doktorgrades der Philosophie an der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, p. 149]: "it is historically well documented that Turkish Cypriots showed large differences in their frequency of communication in Cypriot Greek [...]: On one end of the spectrum are Turkish Cypriots who were probably monolingual Cypriot Greek speakers or had only little competency in Turkish, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cypriot Turkish==
Emanating from [[Anatolia]] and evolved for four centuries, Cypriot Turkish is the [[vernacular]] spoken by Cypriots with [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]] ancestry, as well as by Cypriots who converted to [[Islam]] during Ottoman rule.&lt;ref&gt; Jennings, Ronald (1993), Christians and Muslims in Ottoman Cyprus and the Mediterranean World, 1571-1640, New York University Press {{ISBN|0-814-74181-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cypriot Turkish consists of a blend of [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and the [[Yörük]] dialect that is spoken in the [[Taurus Mountains]] of southern [[Turkey]]. In addition it has absorbed influences from [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[English language|English]]. Cypriot Turkish is mutually intelligible with [[Turkish language|Standard Turkish]].

==Minority languages==
Two [[minority language]]s are covered by the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] in Cyprus, [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Cypriot Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Implementation of the Charter in Cyprus |work=Database for the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages |publisher=Public Foundation for European Comparative Minority Research |accessdate=26 June 2013 |url=http://languagecharter.eokik.hu/sites/StatesParties/Cyprus.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207055025/http://languagecharter.eokik.hu/sites/StatesParties/Cyprus.htm |archivedate= 7 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armenian===

[[Armenians]] have inhabited Cyprus since the sixth century AD, but about 9,000 more arrived from Turkey in the early 20th century to escape the [[Armenian Genocide]]. Of those, most moved on to other countries. Today, [[Western Armenian]] is taught in Armenian schools (''Nareg'') and is the first language of about 3,000 people of [[Armenians in Cyprus|Armenian descent]] in the Republic.

===Cypriot Arabic===
It is not entirely clear when Arabic first made its way to Cyprus, but Arabic speakers are known to have emigrated from the Levant in the late 12th century AD.&lt;ref name="Borg 1997" /&gt;{{rp|220}} Today, [[Cypriot Arabic]] (CA) is moribund with efforts being made to [[language revitalization|revitalise]] it. It is spoken by an estimated 900 [[Maronites in Cyprus|Cypriot Maronites]], all over the age of 30. [[Kormakitis]] was a long-time stronghold of the language, but most Maronites relocated to the south and spread after 1974, fuelling its—now very likely—[[language death|death]].&lt;ref name="Hadjioannou Tsiplakou Kappler 2011" /&gt;{{rp|507}} CA speakers are bilingual in Greek and CA, and CA, having long existed cut off from other varieties of Arabic, has been heavily influenced by Cypriot Greek, with respect to its [[syntax]], vocabulary and, particularly, phonology: it has lost all [[emphatic consonant]]s and [[stop consonant|stop]] [[consonant voicing and devoicing|voicing]] opposition. CA has traits in common with some [[North Mesopotamian Arabic|north Syrian and Mesopotamian dialects]] and sedentary vernaculars spoken on the Levantine coast.&lt;ref name="Borg 1997"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alexander|last=Borg|chapter=Cypriot Arabic Phonology|editor-last=Kaye|editor-first=Alan S.|title=Phonologies of Asia and Africa (including the Caucasus)|volume=1|pages=219–244|publication-place=Winona Lake, Indiana|publisher=Eisenbrauns|year=1997|isbn=1-57506-017-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T6jmziooEk0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|220–222}} Cypriot Arabic has not so far been [[codification (linguistics)|codified]], though there are plans to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Office of the Law Commissioner|publisher=Council of Europe|year=2011|title=European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.

==Foreign languages==
Proficiency in English is high (higher than in many other European countries), and Cypriots that receive education in English might code-switch between Cypriot Greek and English. English features on road signs, public notices, and in advertisements, etc.&lt;ref name="Ammon et al. 2006" /&gt;{{rp|1888}} English was the sole official language during British colonial rule and lingua franca (until 1960) and continued to be used (''[[de facto]]'') in courts of law until 1989 and in legislature until 1963.&lt;ref name="Euromosaic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyprus|work=Euromosaic III|url=http://ec.europa.eu/languages/documents/cy_en.pdf|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4.4}} A reported 80.4% of residents of Cyprus perceive to have command of the English language as [[second language|L2]], a 10.8% of French, a 4.6% of German, a 2.8% of Russian, and a 2.0% of Spanish.

===Arcadocypriot and transitional Greek===
The [[Ancient Greek|ancient]] [[Arcadocypriot Greek|Arcadocypriot dialect]] of Greek was spoken by the [[Mycenaean Greeks]] to first settle in Cyprus in the 12th or 11th century BCE. It was eventually succeeded by [[Koine Greek]] in the fourth century BCE&lt;ref name="Hadjioannou Tsiplakou Kappler 2011" /&gt;{{rp|509}} and later [[Byzantine Greek|Byzantine Koine]] evolved into Cypriot Greek.&lt;ref name="Joseph Tserdanelis 2003" /&gt;

===Eteocypriot===
[[Eteocypriot]] was a [[pre-Indo-European language]], indigenous to the island, that competed with Greek following the latter's arrival and was ultimately supplanted by it by the third century BCE. It was written in the [[Cypriot syllabary]] that was adopted for Arcadocypriot; the same writing system was used to write both (unrelated) languages. For the time that the two languages co-existed, the peoples of Cyprus were bilingual (and bicultural).&lt;ref name="Haarmann 1995" /&gt;{{rp|115–116}}

A '''manifesto''' is a published declaration of the intentions, motives, or views of the issuer, be it an individual, group, political party or government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manifesto Merriam-Webster online dictionary definition of Manifesto].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seophonist-wahl.de/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912054800/http://www.seophonist-wahl.de/ |archivedate=September 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}  {{de icon}}, article on "Wahlprogramm", literally "election programme".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/manifesto Dictionary.com definition of Manifesto].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Robertson, ''The Routledge Dictionary of Politics'',
Edition 3, Psychology Press, 1890 [https://books.google.com/books?id=WcIkEz3a4nIC&amp;pg=PA295 p. 295], {{ISBN|0415323770}}, 9780415323772&lt;/ref&gt;  A manifesto usually accepts a previously published opinion or [[Consensus decision-making|public consensus]] or promotes a new idea with prescriptive notions for carrying out changes the author believes should be made. It often is [[Politics|political]] or [[Art manifesto|artistic]] in nature, but may present an individual's [[life stance]]. Manifestos relating to [[religious belief]] are generally referred to as [[creed]]s.

== Etymology ==

It is derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''manifesto'', itself derived from the [[Latin]] ''manifestum'', meaning clear or conspicuous. Its first recorded use in English is from 1620, in [[Nathaniel Brent]]'s translation of [[Paolo Sarpi]]'s ''History of the Council of Trent'': "To this citation he made answer by a Manifesto" (p.&amp;nbsp;102). Similarly, "They were so farre surprised with his Manifesto, that they would never suffer it to be published''" (p.&amp;nbsp;103).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational Manifestos ==
{{Undue weight section|date=May 2018}}{{Refimprove section|date=May 2018}}
[[File:Democracy and Education title page.jpg|thumb|322x322px|An Early Manifesto on Education]]
Educational manifestos are documents proposing a change or changes to a current education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thekeysupport.com/insights/2017/05/20/manifesto-summaries-what-do-they-say-about-education/|title=Manifesto summaries: what do they say about education? {{!}} The Key|last=Edwards|first=Mark|date=2017-05-20|work=The Key|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2018}} They can be written by governing bodies, organizations, or individuals involved in education as parents, student, administrators, or other stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/education|title=Better Education for better Democracies|website=Education|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Specify|reason=This just goes to a homepage|date=May 2018}} The writer or writers are positioned as a minority group, with manifestos aimed at a majority group. Educational manifestos include personal or group beliefs about what is important or right in education, make statements about the current state of education, differentiate common terms in education, and make suggestions for changing current education systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://davinebanks.com/teaching/|title=A Teaching Manifesto - DAVIN EBANKS|work=DAVIN EBANKS|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=May 2018}} 

They can often include observations about society and whether or not students are prepared to participate fully in it when they are finished with mandatory schooling.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetattooedprof.com/2016/07/06/radical-hope-a-teaching-manifesto/|title=Radical Hope: A Teaching Manifesto|date=2016-07-06|work=The Tattooed Professor|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=May 2018}} These observations can include a perceived misalignment between mandatory school and society, an unjust, unfair, or right aspect of education, or perceived lack of personalization in learning. Other topics that are frequently addressed in educational manifestos include curriculum, funding, personalization, class size, teacher burnout, and standardized testing, among others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=May 2018}}
[[File:ManifestoforTeachingOnline.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Digital Humanities Education Manifesto]]
These manifestos may offer a reflection or rethinking of some aspect of education or teaching and learning.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://claireboonstra.com/manifesto/|title=manifesto for education {{!}} A movement from status to value|date=2012-11-05|work=Claire Boonstra|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=May 2018}} These may include personal stories, quotes, anecdotes, or experiences in the classroom or administration. The reflection or rethinking serves to illustrate how or why an aspect of an educational system requires change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-articles/rsa-blogs/2017/06/education-manifestos|title=Education Manifestos 2017 – Testing, Testing, 123…|last=RSA|first=|date=|website=[[Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reflections often remind readers of the importance of positive, consistent teacher-student relationships in a good education system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=May 2018}}

Educational manifestos call for reflection or ‘rethinking' on the part of the majority in education, offer a reason to hope for change, and make recommendations to put change into action.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=May 2018}} Reasons for hope can include anecdotes from students, teachers, or parents, or a callback to what motivates teachers and students to teach and learn together. Manifestos written by individuals frequently conclude by sharing techniques, tactics, or philosophies that the writer has found helpful in their own teaching or administrative practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tomprof.stanford.edu/posting/711|title=A Teaching Manifesto {{!}} Tomorrow's Professor Postings|website=tomprof.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Reliable source?|date=May 2018|reason=This looks like it's a message sent out by staff to students, so not sure if it can be used}} Those written by groups or organizations include recommendations for initiating or continuing change in appropriate areas.

Largely self-taught in the study of Islamic texts, Albani is considered to be a major figure of the purist [[Salafi]] movement which developed in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Henri |last=Lauzière | year=2015 | title=The Making of Salafism: Islamic Reform in the Twentieth Century|publisher=Columbia University Press|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/product/464271| via = [[De Gruyter]]|subscription=yes|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Albani did not advocate violence, preferring [[Political quietism in Islam|quietism]] and obedience to established governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Bernard |last=Haykel |title=Salafī Groups|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L.

A [[watchmaker]] by trade, al-Albani was active as a writer, publishing chiefly on [[hadith]] and [[Science of hadith|its sciences]]. He also lectured widely in the Mideast, Spain and the United Kingdom on the Salafist movement.

In the 1960s, Albani was invited to teach at the [[Islamic University of Madinah]] in Saudi Arabia. His views were opposed by numerous traditional clerics and his contract allowed to lapse. He later returned from Syria for a brief time in the 1970s as the head of higher education in [[Islamic law]] in [[Mecca]]. He again aroused too much opposition, and returned to Syria. After serving time under house arrest by the Syrian government in 1979, Albani moved to Jordan, where he resided for the rest of his life.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Albani was born into a poor Muslim family in the city of [[Shkodër]] in northern [[Albania]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joas Wagemakers|year=2016|title=Salafism in Jordan: Political Islam in a Quietist Community|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-10716-366-9|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=L13WDAAAQBAJ|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="king"&gt;[http://kfip.org/sheikh-mohammad-nasir-ad-din-al-albani/ Sheikh Mohammad Nasir Ad-Din Al-Albani], [[King Faisal International Prize]] official website. Accessed November 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of the secularist Albanian leader [[Ahmet Zogu]], al-Albani's family migrated to [[Damascus]], [[Syria]]. In Damascus, Albani completed his early education – initially taught by his father – in the [[Quran]], [[Tajwid]], [[Arabic]] linguistic sciences, [[Hanafi]] [[Fiqh]] and further branches of the Islamic faith, also helped by native Syrian scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Roel Meijer, ''Global Salafism: Islam's New Religious Movement'', pg. 63. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Columbia University Press]], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, he earned a modest living as a [[carpenter]] before joining his father as a [[watchmaker]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Albani began to specialize in [[hadith studies]] in the 1930s. Though he was largely self-taught,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9iDaVH7T7boC|title=Awakening Islam|last=Lacroix|first=Stephane|last2=Holoch|first2=George|date=2011-08-15|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674061071|page=119|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qpDWl2a_lzQC|title=Producing Islamic Knowledge: Transmission and dissemination in Western Europe|last=Bruinessen|first=Martin van|last2=Allievi|first2=Stefano|date=2013-06-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136932854|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rvBOAQAAIAAJ|title=Global Salafism: Islam's new religious movement|last=Meijer|first=Roel|date=2009-10-01|publisher=Hurst &amp; Co.|page=63|language=en|quote=In this way he became a self-taught expert on Islam, learning from the books rather than the ''ulema''.

He followed this writing a series of lectures and books, as well as publishing articles in [[al-Manar (journal)|''Al-Manar'' magazine]].&lt;ref name=king/&gt;

===Scholastic career===

Starting in 1954, Albani began delivering informal weekly lessons. By 1960, his popularity began to worry the government of Syria, and he was placed under surveillance by the Hafiz al-Asad government. He was imprisoned twice in 1969.&lt;ref name="Olidort"&gt;Jacob Olidort, [http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2015/02/salafism-quietist-politics-olidort]. "The Politics of "Quietist" Salafism", [[Brookings Institution]], Analysis Paper No. 18, February 2015, pg 14&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s, the government placed him under house arrest more than once.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, ''Global Salafism'', pg. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a number of his works were published, Albani was invited to teach [[Hadith]] at the [[Islamic University of Madinah]] in Saudi Arabia by the University's then-vice president, [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz]]. Shortly upon his arrival, Albani angered the [[Wahhabi]] elite in Saudi Arabia, who did not like his anti-traditionalist stances in Muslim jurisprudence. They were alarmed by Albani's intellectual challenges to the ruling [[Hanbali]] school of law but were unable to challenge him openly due to his popularity.&lt;ref name=glo66&gt;Meijer, ''Global Salafism'', pg. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; When Albani wrote a book supporting his view that the [[Niqab]], or full face-veil, was not a binding obligation upon Muslim women, he caused a minor uproar in the country. His opponents ensured that his contract with the university was allowed to lapse without renewal.&lt;ref name=glo66/&gt;

In 1963, Albani left Saudi Arabia and returned to his studies and work in the [[Az-Zahiriyah library]] in Syria. He left his watch shop in the hands of one of his brothers. He was later invited back to Saudi Arabia in the 1970s but did not remain long because of opposition from clerics.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Imprisonment in Syria===

He was placed under house arrest more than once in the 1970s by the [[Ba'ath]] regime of [[Hafez al-Assad]].&lt;ref name="Olidort"/&gt;&lt;ref name=salafism&gt;{{Cite book|title = Jordanian Salafism: A Strategy for the "Islamization of Society"and an Ambiguous Relationship with the State|url = http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/amman/07758-book2.pdf|publisher = Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung|isbn = 9780674049642|language = en|last=Abu Rumman|first=Mohammad |last2=Abu Hanieh|first2=Hassan|page = 43|year = 2011}} Dec 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Syrian government accused Albani of "promoting the [[Wahhabi]] da'wa, which distorted Islam and confused Muslims."&lt;ref name=salafism/&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Later life===

Albani visited various countries for preaching and lectures – amongst them [[Qatar]], [[Egypt]], [[Kuwait]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], Spain, and the United Kingdom. He moved a number of times between Syria and a couple of cities in Jordan. He also lived in the UAE.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

After [[Bin Baz]]'s intervention with Saudi educational management, Albani was invited to [[Saudi Arabia]] a second time in order to serve as the head of higher education in [[Islamic law]] in [[Mecca]].&lt;ref name="meijer"&gt;Meijer, ''Global Salafism'', pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; This did not last due to controversy among the Saudi establishment regarding Albani's views.

Albani returned to Syria, where he was briefly jailed again in 1979. He moved to Jordan, living there for the remainder of his time. He died in 1999 at the age of 85.&lt;ref name=king/&gt;

==Views==
{{Salafi}}
Albani was a proponent of [[Salafism]] and is considered one of the movement's primary figureheads in the 20th century. Albani criticised the four mainstream [[Madhhab|schools]] of [[Islamic law]] and rejected the traditional Sunni view that Muslims should automatically turn to a [[Madhhab]] for [[fiqh]] (jurisprudence).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamdeh|first=Emad|date=2017-06-09|title=Qurʾān and Sunna or the Madhhabs?: A Salafi Polemic Against Islamic Legal Tradition|journal=Islamic Law and Society|language=en|volume=24|issue=3|pages=211–253|doi=10.1163/15685195-00240A01|issn=1568-5195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XpLSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Making of a Salafi Muslim Woman: Paths to Conversion|last=Inge|first=Anabel|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780190611675|location=|pages=25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he spent much of his life critically re-evaluating [[hadith]] literature and felt that numerous previously accepted hadiths were unsound.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This led him to produce rulings that were at odds with the Islamic majority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although Salafism has frequently been associated with [[Wahhabism]], Albani distinguished between the two movements, and he criticised the latter while supporting the former. He had a complex relationship to each movement.&lt;ref&gt;Stephane Lacroix, ''Awakening Islam'', pg. 220. Trns. George Holoch. [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]: [[President and Fellows of Harvard College]], 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, ''Global Salafism'', pg. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Albani was amongst some leading Salafi scholars who were preaching for decades against what they considered the warped literalism of extremists. Politically they were quietists who rejected vigilantism and rebellion against the state. They believed that Muslims should focus on purifying their beliefs and practice and that, in time, "God would bring victory over the forces of falsehood and unbelief."&lt;ref name="jacb"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = A.C. Brown|first1 = Jonathan|title = Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy|date = 2014|publisher = Oneworld Publications|isbn = 978-1780744209|pages = 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albani's own views on jurisprudence and dogma have been a matter of debate and discussion. During a 1989 visit to Saudi Arabia, Albani was asked if he adhered to the lesser-known [[Zahiri]] school of Islamic law; he responded affirmatively.&lt;ref&gt;al-Albani, "Shareet al-Khobar," tape No. 4, 1989: [[Khobar]], [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;/ref&gt; Albani's opponents among the mainstream have affirmed this as a point of criticism. A number of Albani's students have denied his association with any formal school of jurisprudence.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Controversies==

Albani held a number of controversial views that ran counter to the wider Islamic consensus, and more specifically to [[Hanbali]] jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=Lacroix2&gt;Stephane Lacroix, [https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/17210/ISIM_21_Al-Albani-s_Revolutionary_Approach_to_Hadith.pdf?sequence=1 Al-Albani's Revolutionary Approach to Hadith]. [[Leiden University]]'s ISIM Review, Spring 2008, No. 21. Page 6&lt;/ref&gt;
These include:
* his view that [[mihrab]]s – the niche found in a mosques indicating the direction of [[Mecca]] – were [[bid'ah]] (an innovation).&lt;ref name=Lacroix2/&gt;
* his view that it was permissible to pray in a mosque with one's shoes&lt;ref name=Lacroix2/&gt;
* his call for Palestinians to leave the occupied territories since, according to him, they were unable to practice their faith there as they should&lt;ref name=Lacroix2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Awakening Islam|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bhnNqkbaGs8C|publisher = Harvard University Press|date = 2011-01-01|isbn = 9780674049642|language = en|first = Stephane|last = Lacroix|first2 = George|last2 = Holoch|page = 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was also controversial within the [[Salafi]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Batrawi|first1=Samar|title=What ISIS Talks About When It Talks About Palestine|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2015-10-28/what-isis-talks-about-when-it-talks-about-palestine|accessdate=5 June 2016|agency=Foreign Affairs|publisher=Foreign Affairs|date=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* his view that it is prohibited for women to wear gold bracelets.&lt;ref name="Canon2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Canonization of Al-Bukhari and Muslim: The Formation and Function of the Sunni Hadith Canon|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nyMKDEAb4GsC|publisher = BRILL|date = 2007-06-05|isbn = 978-9004158399|language = en|first = Jonathan|last = Brown|page = 325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Albani wrote a book in which he redefined the proper gestures and formulae that constitute the Muslim prayer ritual "according to the Prophet's sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallams practice." These were contrary to the prescriptions of all established schools of jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=Lacroix2/&gt; As he argued that several details of the concrete prayer that have been taught from generation to generation were based on dubious hadith, his book caused considerable unease.&lt;ref name="PIK5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WO-5e-HSdOoC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Producing+Islamic+knowledge#v=onepage&amp;q=Albani&amp;f=false|title=Producing Islamic Knowledge: Transmission and Dissemination in Western Europe|last=Bruinessen|first=Martin van|last2=Allievi|first2=Stefano|date=2013-06-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136932861|page=5|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albani's descriptions for the performance of the [[Tahajjud]] and [[Taraweeh]] prayer deviated considerably from established practice.&lt;ref name="PIK5"/&gt;

Albani openly criticized [[Syed Qutb]] after the leader was executed. He claimed that Qutb had deviated in creed and held the belief of [[Sufi metaphysics|Oneness of Being]]. Further, Albani accused [[Hassan al-Banna]], the leader of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], of not being a religious scholar and holding "positions contrary to the Sunna".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Awakening Islam|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bhnNqkbaGs8C|publisher = Harvard University Press|date = 2011-01-01|isbn = 9780674049642|language = en|first = Stephane|last = Lacroix|first2 = George|last2 = Holoch|page = 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Albani was criticized by a number of contemporary [[Sunni]] scholars. [[Safar Al-Hawali]] criticized Albani for his "categorical condemnation of [[Taqlid]]" and his "radical [[hadith]] based revisionism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Radical Islam and the Revival of Medieval Theology|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GET8PikavOwC|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2012-02-29|isbn = 9781107009646|language = en|first = Daniel|last = Lav|page = 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s Syrian [[Muhaddith|Hadith scholar]] [[Abd al-Fattah Abu Ghudda]] published a tract against al-Albani's reevaluation of [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]].&lt;ref name="Canon"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Canonization of Al-Bukhari and Muslim: The Formation and Function of the Sunni Hadith Canon|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nyMKDEAb4GsC|publisher = BRILL|date = 2007-06-05|isbn = 978-9004158399|language = en|first = Jonathan|last = Brown|page = 327}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 the Egyptian hadith scholar Mahmud Sa'id Mamduh published a work entitled ''Alerting the Muslim to al-Albani's Transgression upon Sahih Muslim.''&lt;ref name="Canon"/&gt;

He stated that:

{{quote|Indeed, I have concluded that his methods disagree with those of the jurists and hadith scholars, and that his methods are creating great disarray and evident disruption in the proofs of jurisprudence both generally and specifically. He lacks trust in the Imams of law and hadith, as well as in the rich hadith and law tradition handed down to us, in which the [[umma]] has taken great pride.&lt;ref name="Canon328"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Canonization of Al-Bukhari and Muslim: The Formation and Function of the Sunni Hadith Canon|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nyMKDEAb4GsC|publisher = BRILL|date = 2007-06-05|isbn = 978-9004158399|language = en|first = Jonathan|last = Brown|page = 328}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Syrian [[Muhaddith|hadith scholar]] Nur al-Din 'Itr rebutted some of al-Albani's views.&lt;ref name="Pierret 106"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1YemPpfsU20C|title=Religion and State in Syria: The Sunni Ulama from Coup to Revolution|last=Pierret|first=Thomas|date=2013-03-25|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107026414|page=106|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary, the Syrian scholar [[Mohamed Said Ramadan Al-Bouti|Said Ramadan al-Bouti]], took issue with Albani's well-known call for all Palestinians to leave [[Israel]], the [[West Bank]], and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RMhRCgAAQBAJ|title=Understanding Jihad|last=Cook|first=David|date=2015-09-01|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=9780520962491|page=123|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote two rebuttals of al-Albani entitled ''Anti-Madhabism: the dangers of an innovation that threaten the Sharia'' and ''Salafiyya: a blessed historical period, not a school of fiqh.''&lt;ref name="Pierret 106"/&gt;

Lebanese scholar Gibril Fouad Haddad dubbed al-Albani "the chief innovator of our time" and accused him of [[bid'ah]].&lt;ref name="Canon"/&gt; The "reformed" [[jihadist]] [[Sayyed Imam Al-Sharif]] considered Albani to be "wrapped in evil" and "not suitable to be a sheikh" for his alleged claim that [[Jihad]] is defined as forgiveness, education and prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Global Jihadism: Theory and Practice|url = https://books.google.com/?id=-zd8AgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Global+Jihadism,+theory+and+practice#v=onepage&amp;q=Albani&amp;f=false|publisher = Routledge|date = 2008-09-03|isbn = 9781134055418|language = en|first = Jarret M.|last = Brachman|page = 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and honors==
Albani was awarded the [[King Faisal International Prize]] in 1999 before his death for his contributions to [[King Faisal International Prize#Services to Islam|Islamic studies]]. The award committee described him as "considered by many academics as probably the greatest Islamic scholar of the 20th Century."&lt;ref name=king/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;["Albani 1999 KFIP winner"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a period of sixty years, Albani's lectures and published books were highly influential in the field of Islamic studies, and many of his works became widely referred to by other Islamic scholars.&lt;ref name=king/&gt;
[[Muhibb-ud-Deen Al-Khatib]], a contemporary scholar, said of him: "And from the callers to the Sunnah who devoted their lives to reviving it was our brother Muhammad Nasiruddin Nooh Najati Al-Albani."&lt;ref name="asalaah"&gt;al-Asalaah, Issue #23, Pg. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' remarked that Albani's movement of "'Quietist Salafism' with its strong opposition to [[takfir]]ism (doctrine of excommunication and declaring other Muslims of being heretics) and violence may provide the rhetoric that could prevent youth from being drawn to the apocalyptic rubbish of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tariq|first1=Khwaja Khusro|title=Want to Defeat ISIS?

[[File:Mother and Home of John Jones (Myrddin Fardd), Llanbedrog NLW3364584.jpg|thumb|Mother and Home of John Jones (Myrddin Fardd), Llanbedrog, c.1885]]
'''John Jones''' ([[1836 in Wales|1836]] &amp;ndash; [[July 27]], [[1921 in Wales|1921]]), better known under his ''nom de plume'' '''Myrddin Fardd''', was a Welsh writer and antiquarian scholar born in [[Llangian]], [[Caernarfonshire]].

He attended Foel-gron School in Mynytho, after which he was apprenticed to a smith at [[Llanystumdwy]].  He remained in the blacksmith's trade for most of his life, setting up in business at [[Chwilog]], but from 1861 onwards he was also a regular competitor at eisteddfodau, both as a poet and a prose writer.

'''Ousterhout's dichotomy''' is [[computer scientist]] [[John Ousterhout]]'s categorization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcl.tk/doc/scripting.html |title=Scripting: Higher Level Programming for the 21st Century |accessdate=2011-10-09 |author=Ousterhout, John |date= March 1998|work=IEEE Computer magazine |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[high-level programming language]]s tend to fall into two groups, each with distinct properties and uses: ''[[system programming]] languages'' and ''[[scripting language]]s'' – compare [[programming in the large and programming in the small]]. This distinction underlies the design of his language [[Tcl]].

System programming languages (or ''applications languages'') usually have the following properties:
* They are [[static typing|typed statically]]
* They support creating complex [[data structure]]s
* Programs in them are compiled into [[machine code]]
* Programs in them are meant to operate largely independently of other programs
System programming languages tend to be used for components and applications with large amounts of internal functionality such as operating systems, database servers, and Web browsers.  These applications typically employ complex algorithms and data structures and require high performance. Prototypical examples of system programming languages include [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Modula-2]].

By contrast, scripting languages (or ''[[glue language]]s'') tend to have the following properties:
* They are [[dynamic typing|typed dynamically]]
* They have little or no provision for complex data structures
* Programs in them (''scripts'') are [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]]
Scripting languages tend to be used for applications where most of the functionality comes from other programs (often implemented in system programming languages); the scripts are used to ''glue'' together other programs or add additional layers of functionality on top of existing programs.  Ousterhout claims that scripts tend to be short and are often written by less sophisticated programmers, so execution efficiency is less important than simplicity and ease of interaction with other programs.  Common applications for scripting include Web page generation, report generation, graphical user interfaces, and system administration. Prototypical examples of scripting languages include [[AppleScript]], [[C shell]], [[DOS]] [[batch file]]s, and [[Tcl]].

==History==
The dichotomy was fully set out in {{Harvtxt|Ousterhout|1998}}, though Ousterhout had drawn this distinction since at least the design of Tcl (1988), and had stated it publicly at various times. An early episode was "[http://www.vanderburg.org/OldPages/Tcl/war/ The Tcl War]" of late September and October 1994, where [[Richard Stallman]] posted an article critical of Tcl, entitled "Why you should not use Tcl",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title=Why you should not use Tcl |last=Stallman |first=Richard |date=1994-09-23 |newsgroup=comp.lang.tcl |message-id=9409232314.AA29957@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu |url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.tcl/7JXGt-Uxqag/3JBTj5I43yAJ |accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which Ousterhout replied with an articulation of his dichotomy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title=Re: Why you should not use Tcl |last=Ousterhout |first=John |date=1994-09-26  |newsgroup=comp.lang.tcl |message-id=367307$1un@engnews2.Eng.Sun.COM |url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.tcl/7JXGt-Uxqag/vQNLEgvjmWsJ |accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|
I think that Stallman's objections to Tcl may stem largely from one aspect of Tcl's design that he either doesn't understand or doesn't agree with. This is the proposition that you should use *two* languages for a large software system: one, such as C or C++, for manipulating the complex internal data structures where performance is key, and another, such as Tcl, for writing small-ish scripts that tie together the C pieces and are used for extensions.}}

==Criticism==
Many {{who|date=May 2012}} believe that the dichotomy is highly arbitrary, and refer to it as ''Ousterhout's fallacy'' or ''Ousterhout's false dichotomy''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} While strong-versus-weak typing, data structure complexity, and independent versus stand-alone might be said to be unrelated features, the usual critique of Ousterhout's dichotomy is of its distinction of compiling versus interpreting, since neither semantics nor syntax depend significantly on whether code is compiled into machine-language, interpreted, tokenized, or byte-compiled at the start of each run, or any mix of these. Many languages fall between being interpreted or compiled (e.g. [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], [[UCSD Pascal]], [[Perl]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]). This makes compiling versus interpreting a dubious parameter in a taxonomy of programming languages.

'''Palaihnihan''' (also '''Palaihnih''') is a [[language family]] of northeastern [[California]]. It consists of two closely related languages:

# '''[[Atsugewi language|Atsugewi]]''' ''(†)'' 
# '''[[Achumawi language|Achumawi]]''' (also known as Achomawi, Pit River Indian)

==Reconstructions==
The original reconstruction of proto-Palaihnihan suffered from poor quality data. David Olmsted's dictionary depends almost entirely upon de Angulo, who did not record the phonological distinctions consistently or well,&lt;ref&gt;Nevin 1991, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and carelessly includes [[Pomoan languages|Pomo]] vocabulary from a manuscript in which he (de Angulo) set out to demonstrate that Achumawi and Pomo are not related.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Genetic relations==
The Palaihnihan family is often connected with the hypothetical [[Hokan languages|Hokan]] stock. Proposed special relationships within Hokan include Palaihnihan with [[Shasta language|Shastan]] (known as ''Shasta-Achomawi'') and within a ''Kahi'' sub-group (also known as ''Northern Hokan'') with Shastan, [[Chimariko]], and [[Karuk]].

A '''parse tree''' or '''parsing tree'''&lt;ref&gt;See Chiswell and Hodges 2007: 34.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''derivation tree''' or '''concrete syntax tree''' is an ordered, rooted [[tree (data structure)|tree]] that represents the [[syntax|syntactic]] structure of a [[string (computer science)|string]] according to some [[context-free grammar]]. The term ''parse tree'' itself is used primarily in [[computational linguistics]]; in theoretical syntax, the term ''syntax tree'' is more common.

Parse trees concretely{{clarify|what, specifically, is concrete?|date=January 2017}} reflect the syntax of the input language, making them distinct from the [[abstract syntax tree]]s used in computer programming. Unlike Reed-Kellogg [[sentence diagram]]s used for teaching grammar, parse trees do not use distinct symbol shapes for different types of [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]].

Parse trees are usually constructed based on either the constituency relation of constituency grammars ([[phrase structure grammar]]s) or the dependency relation of [[dependency grammar]]s. Parse trees may be generated for [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s in [[natural language]]s (see [[natural language processing]]), as well as during [[compiler|processing]] of computer languages, such as [[programming language]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

A related concept is that of '''phrase marker''' or '''P-marker''', as used in [[transformational generative grammar]]. A phrase marker is a linguistic expression marked as to its phrase structure. This may be presented in the form of a tree, or as a bracketed expression. Phrase markers are generated by applying [[phrase structure rules]], and themselves are subject to further transformational rules.&lt;ref name="Chomsky2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Noam Chomsky|title=Aspects of the Theory of Syntax|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljFkBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22phrase%20marker%22&amp;f=false|date=26 December 2014|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-52740-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A set of possible parse trees for a [[syntactic ambiguity|syntactically ambiguous]] sentence is called a "parse forest."&lt;ref&gt;Billot, Sylvie, and Bernard Lang. "[https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00075520/document The structure of shared forests in ambiguous parsing]."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constituency-based parse trees==
The constituency-based parse trees of constituency grammars (= [[phrase structure grammar]]s) distinguish between terminal and non-terminal nodes. The [[interior node]]s are labeled by [[nonterminal|non-terminal]] categories of the grammar, while the [[leaf node]]s are labeled by [[terminal symbol|terminal]] categories. The image below represents a constituency-based parse tree; it shows the syntactic structure of the [[English language|English]] sentence ''John hit the ball'':

:::[[File:Parse tree 1.jpg|Parse tree PSG]]

The parse tree is the entire structure, starting from S and ending in each of the leaf nodes (''John'', ''hit'', ''the'', ''ball''). The following abbreviations are used in the tree:

::* S for [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], the top-level structure in this example

::* NP for [[noun phrase]]. The first (leftmost) NP, a single noun "John", serves as the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the sentence. The second one is the [[object (grammar)|object]] of the sentence.

::* VP for [[verb phrase]], which serves as the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]

::* V for [[verb]]. In this case, it's a [[transitive verb]] ''hit''.

::* D for [[determiner (class)|determiner]], in this instance the [[article (grammar)|definite article]] "the"

::* N for [[noun]]

Each node in the tree is either a ''root'' node, a ''branch'' node, or a ''leaf'' node.&lt;ref&gt;See Carnie (2013:118ff.) for an introduction to the basic concepts of syntax trees (e.g. root node, terminal node, non-terminal node, etc.).&lt;/ref&gt; A root node is a node that doesn't have any branches on top of it. Within a sentence, there is only ever one root node. A branch node is a mother node that connects to two or more daughter nodes. A leaf node, however, is a terminal node that does not dominate other nodes in the tree. S is the root node, NP and VP are branch nodes, and ''John'' (N), ''hit'' (V), ''the'' (D), and ''ball'' (N) are all leaf nodes. The leaves are the lexical tokens of the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;See Aho et al. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; A mother node is one that has at least one other node linked by a branch under it. In the example, S is a parent of both N and VP. A daughter node is one that has at least one node directly above it to which it is linked by a branch of a tree. From the example, ''hit'' is a daughter node of V.  The terms ''parent'' and ''child'' are also sometimes used for this relationship.

==Dependency-based parse trees==
The dependency-based parse trees of [[dependency grammar]]s&lt;ref&gt;See for example Ágel et al. 2003/2006.&lt;/ref&gt; see all nodes as terminal, which means they do not acknowledge the distinction between terminal and non-terminal categories. They are simpler on average than constituency-based parse trees because they contain fewer nodes. The dependency-based parse tree for the example sentence above is as follows:

:::[[File:Parse2.jpg|Parse tree DG]]

This parse tree lacks the phrasal categories (S, VP, and NP) seen in the constituency-based counterpart above. Like the constituency-based tree, [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] structure is acknowledged. Any complete sub-tree of the tree is a constituent. Thus this dependency-based parse tree acknowledges the subject noun ''John'' and the object noun phrase ''the ball'' as constituents just like the constituency-based parse tree does.

The constituency vs. dependency distinction is far-reaching. Whether the additional syntactic structure associated with constituency-based parse trees is necessary or beneficial is a matter of debate.

==Phrase markers==
Phrase markers, or P-markers, were introduced in early [[transformational generative grammar]], as developed by [[Noam Chomsky]] and others. A phrase marker representing the [[deep structure]] of a sentence is generated by applying [[phrase structure rule]]s. Then, this application may undergo further transformations. 

Phrase markers may be presented in the form of [[Tree (data structure)|trees]] (as in the above section on [[#Constituency-based parse trees|constituency-based parse trees]]), but are often given instead in the form of "bracketed expressions", which occupy less space in the memory. For example, a bracketed expression corresponding to the constituency-based tree given above may be something like :

&lt;math&gt;[_S\ [_\mathit{NP}\ John]\ [_\mathit{VP}\ [_V\ hit]\ [_\mathit{NP}\ the\ [_N\ ball]]]]&lt;/math&gt;

As with trees, the precise construction of such expressions and the amount of detail shown can depend on the theory being applied and on the points that the query author wishes to illustrate.

A '''postage stamp''' is a small piece of paper issued by a [[Post_office|post office]], [[postal administration]], or other authorized vendors to customers who pay postage (the cost involved in moving, insuring, or registering mail), who then affix the stamp to the face or address-side of any item of [[mail]]—an [[envelope]] or other postal cover (e.g., packet, box, mailing cylinder)—that they wish to send.  The item is then processed by the postal system, where a [[postmark]] or cancellation mark—in modern usage indicating date and point of origin of mailing—is applied to the stamp and its left and right sides to prevent its reuse.  The item is then delivered to its addressee.  

Always featuring the name of the issuing nation, a denomination of its value, and often an illustration of persons, events, institutions, or natural realities that symbolize the nation's traditions and values, every stamp is printed on a piece of usually rectangular, but sometimes triangular or otherwise shaped [[postage stamp paper|special custom-made paper]] whose back is either glazed with an [[postage stamp gum|adhesive gum]] or [[Pressure-sensitive adhesive|self-adhesive]]. 

Because governments issue stamps of different denominations in unequal numbers and routinely discontinue some lines and introduce others, and because of their illustrations and association with the social and political realities of the time of their issue, they are often prized for their beauty and historical significance by [[Stamp_collecting|stamp collectors]] whose study of their history and of mailing systems is called  [[philately]]. Because collectors often buy stamps from an issuing agency with no intention to use them for postage, the revenues from such purchases and payments of postage can make them a source of net profit to that agency.

Throughout [[modern history]], numerous methods were used to indicate that postage had been paid on a mailed item, so several different men have received credit for inventing the postage stamp. 

;William Dockwra
In 1680, [[William Dockwra]], an English merchant in London, and his partner [[Robert Murray (financier)|Robert Murray]] established the [[London Penny Post]], a mail system that delivered letters and small parcels inside the city of London for the sum of one penny. Confirmation of paid postage was indicated by the use of a hand ''stamp'' to frank the mailed item. Though this 'stamp' was applied to the letter or parcel itself, rather than to a separate piece of paper, it is considered by many historians to be the world's first postage stamp.&lt;ref name="William Dockwra and the Penny Post Service"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/cpm/chrono/ch1680ae.shtml |title=William Dockwra and the Penny Post Service |publisher=Canadian Museum of Civilization |accessdate=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Lovrenc Košir
In 1835, the [[Slovenes|Slovene]] civil servant [[Lovrenc Košir]] from [[Ljubljana]] in [[Austria-Hungary]] (now [[Slovenia]]), suggested the use of "artificially affixed postal tax stamps"&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110501020540/http://newissues.stanleygibbons.com/include/content_stampdetails.asp?id=1671/04_may1a "New Issues: Technical Details: Lovrenc Košir"] ''Stanley Gibbons'', archived on 10 May 2011 by [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; using "gepresste papieroblate" ("pressed paper wafers"), but although civil bureaucrats considered the suggestion in detail, it was not adopted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stampdomain.com/stamp_invention/kosir.htm Lovrenc Košir] stampdomain.com 2012. Retrieved 1 March 2012. [https://www.webcitation.org/65py4VSzA Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Meet the new Rowland Hill" in [[Gibbons Stamp Monthly]], April 1949, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Rowland Hill
In 1836, a Member of (British) Parliament, [[Robert Wallace (MP for Greenock)|Robert Wallace]], gave [[Rowland Hill (postal reformer)|Sir Rowland Hill]] numerous books and documents about the postal service, which Hill described as a "half [[Hundredweight|hundred weight]] of material".&lt;ref&gt;The Life of Sir Rowland Hill, p.246&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Hill, Rowland &amp; Hill, George Birkbeck, ''The Life of Sir Rowland Hill and the History of the Penny Post'', Thomas De La Rue, 1880, p.242&lt;/ref&gt;   After a detailed study, on 4 January 1837 Hill submitted a pamphlet entitled ''Post Office Reform: Its Importance and Practicability'', marked "private and confidential," and not released to the general public, to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Thomas_Spring_Rice,_1st_Baron_Monteagle_of_Brandon|Thomas Spring Rice]].&lt;ref&gt;Muir, Douglas N, ''Postal Reform &amp; the Penny Black'', National Postal Museum, 1990, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; The Chancellor summoned Hill to a meeting at which he suggested improvements and changes to be presented in a supplement, which Hill duly produced and submitted on 28 January 1837.&lt;ref&gt;The Life of Sir Rowland Hill, p.264&lt;/ref&gt;  

Summoned to give evidence before the Commission for Post Office Enquiry on 13 February 1837, Hill read from the letter he wrote to the Chancellor that included a statement saying that the notation of paid postage could be created "...by using a bit of paper just large enough to bear the stamp, and covered at the back with a glutinous wash...".&lt;ref&gt;The Life of Sir Rowland Hill, p.269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Ninth Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the Management of the Post-office Department'', 1837, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; This would eventually become the first unambiguous description of a modern adhesive postage stamp (though the term "postage stamp" originated at later date). Shortly afterward, Hill's revision of the booklet, dated 22 February 1837, containing some 28,000 words, incorporating the supplement given to the Chancellor and statements he made to the Commission, was published and made available to the general public. Hansard records that on 15 December 1837, [[Benjamin Hawes]] asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer "whether it was the intention of the Government to give effect to the recommendation of the Commissioners of the Post-office, contained in their ninth report relating to the reduction of the rates of postage, and the issuing of penny stamps?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1837/dec/15/post-office#column_1116 Hansard 15 December 1837]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill’s ideas for postage stamps and charging paid-postage based on weight soon took hold, and were adopted in many countries throughout the world. With the new policy of charging by weight, using envelopes for mailing documents became the norm. Hill’s brother Edwin invented a prototype envelope-making machine that folded paper into envelopes quickly enough to match the pace of the growing demand for postage stamps.&lt;ref name="British Postal Museum &amp; Archive"&gt;[http://postalheritage.wordpress.com/2009/08/21/rowland-hill%E2%80%99s-postal-reforms/ The British Postal Museum &amp; Archive, Rowland Hill’s Postal Reforms]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowland Hill and the reforms he introduced to the United Kingdom postal system appear on several of its commemorative stamps.&lt;ref name="British Postal Museum &amp; Archive"/&gt;

;James Chalmers
In the 1881 book ''The Penny Postage Scheme of 1837'', Scotsman Patrick Chalmers claimed that his father, [[James Chalmers (inventor)|James Chalmers]], published an essay in August 1834 describing and advocating a postage stamp, but submitted no evidence of the essay's existence. Nevertheless, until he died in 1891, Patrick Chalmers campaigned to have his father recognized as the inventor of the postage stamp. &lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, Patrick, ''The Penny Postage Scheme of 1837'', Effingham Wilson, 1881&lt;/ref&gt; Until his death i

The first independent evidence for Chalmers' claim is an essay, dated 8 February 1838 and received by the Post Office on 17 February 1838, in which he proposed adhesive postage stamps to the [[General Post Office]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://postalheritage.org.uk/collections/archive/stamps/phillips/VolI/Vol_I_pg_005/Vol_I_pg_005/image James Chalmers essay of 1837]&lt;/ref&gt; In this approximately 800-word document concerning methods of indicating that postage had been paid on mail he states: 

:"Therefore, of Mr Hill’s plan of a uniform rate of postage ... I conceive that the most simple and economical mode ... would be by Slips ... in the hope that Mr Hill’s plan may soon be carried into operation I would suggest that sheets of Stamped Slips should be prepared ... then be rubbed over on the back with a strong solution of gum ...". 

Chalmers' original document is now in the United Kingdom's National Postal Museum.

Since Chalmers used the same  postage denominations that Hill had proposed in February 1837, it is clear that he  was aware of Hill’s proposals, but whether he obtained a copy of Hill’s booklet or simply read about it in one or both of the two detailed accounts (25 March 1837&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 25 March 1837&lt;/ref&gt; and 20 December 1837&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 20 December 1837&lt;/ref&gt;) published in ''[[The Times]]'' is unknown.  Neither article mentioned "a bit of paper just large enough to bear the stamp," so Chalmers could not have known that Hill had made such a proposal. This suggests that either Chalmers had previously read Hill's booklet and was merely elaborating Hill's idea, or he had independently developed the idea of the modern postage stamp.

James Chalmers organized petitions "for a low and uniform rate of postage". The first such petition was presented in the House of Commons on 4 December 1837 (from Montrose).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1837/dec/04/minutes#S3V0039P0_18371204_HOC_2 Hansard 4 Dec 1837]&lt;/ref&gt; Further petitions organised by him were presented on 1 May 1838 (from Dunbar and Cupar), 14 May 1838 (from the county of Forfar), and 12 June 1839. At this same time, other groups organised petitions and presented them to Parliament.  All petitions for consumer-oriented, low-cost, volume-based postal rates followed publication of Hill's proposals.

==History==
[[File:Penny black.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Penny Black]], the world’s first postage stamp.]]
&lt;!-- The following text was moved from the introduction and should be merged into History:

Postage stamps have facilitated the delivery of mail since the 1840s. Before then, ink and hand-stamps (hence the word 'stamp'), usually made from wood or cork, were often used to frank the mail and confirm the payment of postage. The first adhesive postage stamp, commonly referred to as the [[Penny Black]], was issued in the United Kingdom in 1840. The invention of the stamp was part of an attempt to reform and improve the postal system in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bathpostalmuseum.co.uk/explore/history/history_1800s.html British Postal Museum, The Penny Post and After]&lt;/ref&gt; which, in the early 19th century, was in disarray and rife with corruption.&lt;ref&gt;National Postal Museum: World’s First Postage Stamps&lt;/ref&gt; There are varying accounts of the inventor or inventors of the stamp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norbyhus.dk/btpb.html Before the Penny Black, by Ken Lawrence, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the introduction of postage stamps, mail in the United Kingdom was paid for by the recipient, a system that was associated with an irresolvable problem: the costs of delivering mail were not recoverable by  the postal service when recipients were unable or unwilling to pay for delivered items, and senders had no incentive to restrict the number, size, or weight of items sent, whether or not they would ultimately be paid for.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.costofstamps.net/history_of_postage_stamps.php Cost of Stamps]&lt;/ref&gt; The postage stamp resolved this issue in a simple and elegant manner, with the additional benefit of room for an element of beauty to be introduced. Concurrently with the first stamps, the UK offered [[Wrapper (philately)|wrappers]] for mail.  Later related inventions include [[postal stationery]] such as prepaid-postage envelopes, [[Postcard|post cards]], [[lettercard]]s, [[aerogramme]]s, [[postage meter]]s, and, more recently, specialty boxes and envelopes provided free to the customer by the [[United States Postal Service]] for priority or express mailing.

The postage stamp afforded convenience for both the mailer and postal officials, more effectively recovered costs for the postal service, and ultimately resulted in a better, faster postal system. With the conveniences stamps offered, their use resulted in greatly increased mailings during the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="The British Postal Museum"&gt;[http://postalheritage.org.uk/news_archive/royal-society-350th-anniversary-stamps The British Postal Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; Postage stamps during this era were the most popular way of paying for mail; however, by the end of the 20th century were rapidly being eclipsed by the use of metered postage and bulk mailing by businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Pitney-Bowes-Inc-Company-History.html Pitney-Bowes Postage Meter Company] '''Excerpt:''' (Entering the final decade of the century, PB saw its sales surpass the $3 billion mark for the first time in company history, topping off at $3.2 billion in fiscal 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usps.com/postagesolutions/post_mtr.htm United States Postal Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

As postage stamps with their engraved imagery began to appear on a widespread basis, historians and collectors began to take notice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startstampcollecting.net/ The Life and Times of a Stamp Collector]&lt;/ref&gt; The study of postage stamps and their use is referred to as [[philately]]. [[Stamp collecting]] can be both a [[hobby]] and a form of historical study and reference, as government-issued postage stamps and their mailing systems have always been involved with the history of nations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a1h_1792act.html Smithsonian National Postal Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[Postal Service Act]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
Although a number of people laid claim to the concept of the postage stamp, it is well documented that stamps were first introduced in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] on 1 May 1840 as a part of postal reforms promoted by [[Rowland Hill (postal reformer)|Sir Rowland Hill]]. With its introduction, the postage fee was paid by the sender and not the recipient, though it was still possible to send mail without prepaying. From when the first postage stamps were used, [[postmark]]s were applied to prevent the stamps being used again.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:Washington Franklin 1847 covers.jpg|Photo of two covers bearing the First US Postage stamps showing cancellations]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=2&amp;cmd=1&amp;id=159543&amp;img=1&amp;pg=1 Smithsonian National Postal Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first stamp, the "[[Penny black]]", became available for purchase 1 May 1840, to be valid as of 6 May 1840. Two days later, 8 May 1840, the [[Two penny blue]] was introduced. The Penny black was sufficient for a letter less than half an ounce to be sent anywhere within the UK. Both stamps included an engraving of the young [[Queen Victoria]], without perforations, as the first stamps were separated from their sheets by cutting them with scissors.

The first stamps did not need to show the issuing country, so no country name was included on them. The UK remains the only country to omit its name on postage stamps,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Garfield|first=Simon|title=The Error World: An Affair with Stamps|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|location=Boston|pages=118|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EBI4brLkz7AC&amp;pg=PA118|isbn=0-15-101396-9|date=January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=O'Donnell|first=Kevin|author2=Winger, Larry|title=Internet for Scientists|publisher=CRC Press|location=|pages=19|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xXf068I5-tUC&amp;pg=PA19|isbn=90-5702-222-2|year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using the reigning monarch’s head as country identification. Following the introduction of the postage stamp in the UK, prepaid postage considerably increased the number of letters mailed. Before 1839, the number of letters sent in the UK was typically 76 million. By 1850 this increased five-fold to 350 million, continuing to grow rapidly&lt;ref name="The British Postal Museum"&gt;[http://postalheritage.org.uk/news_archive/royal-society-350th-anniversary-stamps The British Postal Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; until the end of the 20th century when newer methods of indicating the payment of postage reduced the use of stamps.

Other countries soon followed the UK with their own stamps. The [[Canton of Zürich]] in [[Switzerland]] issued the [[Zurich 4 and 6]] [[rappen]] on 1 March 1843. Although the Penny black could be used to send a letter less than half an ounce anywhere within the UK, the Swiss did not initially adopt that system, instead continuing to calculate mail rates based on distance to be delivered. [[Brazil]] issued the [[Bull's Eye (postage stamp)|Bull’s Eye]] stamp on 1 August 1843. Using the same printer used for the Penny black, Brazil opted for an abstract design instead of the portrait of Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], so his image would not be disfigured by a postmark.

In 1845 some [[postmaster]]s in the [[United States]] issued [[A Gallery of U. S. Postmasters' Provisional Stamps, 1845-47|their own stamps]], but it was not until 1847 that the first official U.S. stamps were issued: 5 and 10 cent issues depicting [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[George Washington]]. A few other countries issued stamps in the late 1840s. The famous [[Mauritius "Post Office" stamps]] were issued by Mauritius in September 1847. Many others, such as [[Postage stamps and postal history of India|India]], started their use in the 1850s, and by the 1860s most countries issued stamps.

[[Postage stamp separation|Perforation]] of postage stamps began in January 1854.&lt;ref name=AMEncyclopedia1415 &gt;Why has a Postage Stamp a Perforated Edge? — ''A.M. Encyclopedia'' — Volume Two — page 1415&lt;/ref&gt; The first officially perforated stamps were issued in February 1854. Stamps from Henry Archer's perforation trials were issued in the last few months of 1850; during the 1851 parliamentary session&lt;ref name="AMEncyclopedia1415"/&gt; at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]]; and finally in 1853/54 after the UK government paid Mr. Archer £4,000 for his machine and the patent.&lt;ref name="AMEncyclopedia1415"/&gt;

==Design==
{{Main|Postage stamp design}}
When the first postage stamps were issued in the 1840s, they followed an almost identical standard in shape, size and general subject matter. They were rectangular in shape. They bore the images of Queens, Presidents and other political figures. They also depicted the denomination of the postage-paid, and with the exception of the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;When the [[Universal Postal Union]] began requiring the name of the country on stamps used in the international mails, the United Kingdom was granted an exception, as traditionally, as the first country to use stamps for postage, they had never put the country name on their stamps. See Miller, Rick (2003) "Refresher Course: Symbols can be useful in identifying stamps" ''Linn's Stamp News'' 10 March 2003, archived [https://web.archive.org/web/20101228105659/http://linns.com/howto/refresher/symbols_20030310/refreshercourse.aspx here] by Internet Archive on 28 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; depicted the name of the country from which issued.&lt;ref&gt;Stamps not intended for international mail, such as postage due stamps, do not need to have the country's name.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all early postage stamps depict images of national leaders only.

Soon after the introduction of the postage stamp, other subjects and designs began to appear. Some designs were welcome, others widely criticized. For example, in 1869, the U.S. Post Office broke tradition of depicting presidents or other famous historical figures, instead using other subjects including a train, and horse. (See: [[1869 Pictorial Issue]].) The change was greeted with general disapproval, and sometimes harsh criticism from the American public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspcs.org/uspcs1869.html The U.S. Philatelic Classics Society]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kenmore"&gt;Kenmore Collectors Catalogue, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perforations===
{{Main|Postage stamp separation}}
[[File:Perforations US1940 issues-2c.jpg|thumb|Rows of perforations in a sheet of postage stamps.]]
Perforations are small holes made between individual postage stamps on a sheet of stamps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glossary of Terms |work= |publisher=[[American Philatelic Society]] |date=2017 |url=https://stamps.org/Glossary-of-Terms |accessdate=7 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; facilitating separation of a desired number of stamps. The resulting frame-like, rippled edge surrounding the separated stamp defines a characteristic meme for the appearance of a postage stamp.

In the first decade of postage stamps' existence (depending on the country), stamps were issued without perforations. Scissors or other cutting mechanisms were required to separate a desired number of stamps from a full sheet. If cutting tools were not used, individual stamps were torn off.  This is evidenced by the ragged edges of surviving examples. Mechanically separating stamps from a sheet proved an inconvenience for postal clerks and businesses, both dealing with large numbers of individual stamps on a daily basis. By 1850, methods such as rouletting wheels were being devised in efforts of making stamp separation more convenient, and less time consuming.&lt;ref name="SNPL-Perforations"&gt;[http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/museum/1d_Perforation_Machine.html Smithsonian National postal Museum: Early Perforation Machines]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stamp UK Penny Red pl148.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Penny Red]], 1854 issue. The first officially perforated postage stamp.]]
[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|The United Kingdom]] was the first country to issue postage stamps with perforations.  The first machine specifically designed to perforate sheets of postage stamps was invented in London by [[Henry Archer]], an Irish landowner and railroad man from Dublin, Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffestiniograilway.co.uk/history1.htm Ffestiniog Railway Co.]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1850 [[Penny Red]]&lt;ref name="SNPL-Perforations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Linn's"&gt;[http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/perforations_20020701/refreshercourse.aspx Linn’s Stamp News, Refresher Course, Janet Klug]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Gibbons Ltd, ''Specialised Stamp Catalogue Volume 1: Queen Victoria'' (8th ed. 1985) p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first stamp to be perforated during trial course of Archer's perforating machine. After a period of trial and error and modifications of Archer's invention, new machines based on the principles pioneered by Archer were purchased and in 1854 the U.K. postal authorities started continuously issuing perforated postage stamps in the Penny Red and all subsequent designs.

[[File:Washington 1857 1st perf-3c.jpg|thumb|right|The first officially [[Postage stamp separation|perforated]] United States stamp (1857).]]
In the U.S. the use of postage stamps caught on quickly and became more widespread when on March 3, 1851, the last day of its legislative session, Congress passed the ''Act of March 3, 1851'' (''An Act to reduce and modify the Rates of Postage in the United States'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;mode=1&amp;tid=2027498 National Postal Museum, Charles Toppan &amp; Co.,]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly introduced on the last day of the Congressional session four years later, the ''Act of March 3, 1855'' required the prepayment of postage on all mailings. Thereafter, postage stamp use in the U.S. quickly doubled, and by 1861 had quadrupled.&lt;ref name="SNPL-Perforations"/&gt;

In 1856, under the direction of [[James Campbell (Postmaster General)|Postmaster General James Campbell]], Toppan and Carpenter, (''commissioned by the U.S. government to print U.S. postage stamps through the 1850s'') purchased a rotary machine designed to separate stamps, patented in England in 1854 by William and Henry Bemrose, who were printers in Derby, England.&lt;ref name="National Archives"&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=026-d5239&amp;cid=-1#-1 The National Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; The original machine cut slits into the paper rather than punching holes, but the machine was soon modified.&lt;ref name="Linn's"/&gt;

The first stamp issue to be officially perforated, the 3-cent George Washington, was issued by the U.S. Post Office on February 24, 1857. Between 1857 and 1861 all stamps originally issued between 1851 and 1856 were reissued with perforations. Initial capacity was insufficient to perforate all stamps printed, thus perforated issues used between February and July 1857 are scarce and quite valuable.&lt;ref&gt;Kenmore Collector’s Catalog, 2010, #906.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://values.hobbizine.com/stamps/us-1847-57.html Hobbizine]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shapes and materials===
In addition to the most common rectangular shape, stamps have been issued in geometric (circular, triangular and pentagonal) and irregular shapes.  The United States issued its first circular stamp in 2000 as a [[hologram]] of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/stampstakeflight/holography.html |title=Holography: Into the Future |publisher=National Postal Museum |accessdate=2011-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Associated Press |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/national/stmp141.shtml |title=First round U.S. postage stamp on the way, and that's not all. . . |publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=2000-06-14 |accessdate=2011-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sierra Leone and Tonga have issued stamps in the shapes of fruit. Stamps that are printed on sheets are generally separated by perforations, though, more recently, with the advent of gummed stamps that do not have to be moistened prior to affixing them, designs can incorporate smooth edges (although a purely decorative perforated edge is often present).

Stamps are most commonly made from paper designed specifically for them, and are printed in sheets, rolls, or small booklets. Less commonly, postage stamps are made of materials other than paper, such as [[Embossing (paper)|embossed]] foil (sometimes of [[gold]]). [[Switzerland]] made a stamp that contained a bit of lace and one of wood. The United States produced one of plastic. East Germany issued a stamp of synthetic chemicals. In the Netherlands a stamp was made of silver foil. Bhutan issued one with its [[Postage stamps and postal history of Bhutan|national anthem on a playable record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sandafayre.com/philatelicarticles/talkingstamps.html |title=Bhutan - Talking Stamps" and Other World Firsts! |publisher=Sandafayre (Holdings) Ltd. |accessdate=2013-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphic characteristics===
The subjects found on the face of postage stamps are generally what defines a particular stamp issue to the public and are often a reason why they are saved by collectors or history enthusiasts. Graphical subjects found on postage stamps have ranged from the early portrayals of kings, queens and presidents to later depictions of ships, birds and satellites,&lt;ref name="Kenmore"/&gt; [[List of people on stamps|famous people]],&lt;ref name="Mallon"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/6/2006_6_22.shtml Thomas Mallon] "Stamp: Sober Superheroes, " ''American Heritage'', Nov./Dec. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; historical events, comics, dinosaurs, hobbies (knitting, stamp collecting), sports, holiday themes, and a wealth of other subjects too numerous to list.

Artists, designers, engravers and administrative officials are involved with the choice of subject matter and the method of printing stamps. Early stamp images were almost always produced from [[line engraving|engravings]] — a design etched into a steel die, which was then hardened and whose impression was transferred to a printing plate. Using an ''engraved'' image was deemed a more secure way of printing stamps as it was nearly impossible to counterfeit a finely detailed image with raised lines unless you were a master engraver. In the mid-20th century, stamp issues produced by other forms of printing began to emerge, such as  [[lithography]], [[photogravure]], [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] and [[offset printing|web offset printing]]. These later printing methods were less expensive and typically produced images of lesser quality.

==Types==
[[File:Costa Rica Diamond stamp2 1937-2c.jpg|thumb|right|A Costa Rica [[Airmail]] stamp of 1937.]]
* [[Airmail stamp]] — for payment of airmail service. The term "airmail" or an equivalent is usually printed on special airmail stamps. Airmail stamps typically depict images of airplanes and/or famous pilots and were used when airmail was a special type of mail delivery separate from mail delivered by train, ship or automobile. Aside from mail with local destinations, today almost all other mail is transported by aircraft and thus airmail is now the standard method of delivery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usps.com/communications/news/stamps/2005/sr05_020.htm United States Postal Service / Airmail]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scott catalog|Scott]] has a separate category and listing for U.S. Airmail Postage. Prior to 1940, Scotts Catalogue did not have a special designation for airmail stamps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/airmails_20020930/refreshercourse.aspx Linn’s Stamp News, Refresher Course]&lt;/ref&gt; The various major stamp catalogs have different numbering systems and may not always list airmail stamps the same way.
* [[Postage stamp booklet|Booklet]] stamp — stamps produced and issued in booklet format.
* [[Carrier's stamp]].
* [[Certified mail]] stamp.
* [[Coil stamp]]s — tear-off stamps issued individually in a [[vending machine]], or purchased in a roll.
* [[Commemorative stamp]] — a stamp that is issued for a limited time to commemorate a person or event. Anniversaries of birthdays and historical events are among the most common examples.
* [[Computer vended postage]] — advanced secure postage that uses information-based indicia (IBI) technology. IBI uses a two-dimensional bar code ([[Datamatrix]] or [[PDF417]]) to encode the originating address, date of mailing, postage and a [[digital signature]] to verify the stamp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usps.com/postagesolutions/_doc/MERKSONEDITPCIBIOpen1.doc USPS.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Customised stamp'' — a stamp on which the image can be chosen by the purchaser by sending in a photograph or by use of the computer. Some are not true stamps but technically meter labels.
[[File:Chinese stamp in 1950.jpg|thumb|right|Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong on a Chinese postage stamp, 1950.]]
* [[Definitive (stamp)|Definitive stamps]] — stamps for everyday postage and are usually produced to meet current postal rates. They often have less appealing designs than commemoratives, though there are notable exceptions.&lt;ref name="Scotts1903"&gt;Scotts US Catalogue, 1903 Issue&lt;/ref&gt; The same design may be used for many years. The use of the same design over an extended period may lead to unintended color varieties. This may make them just as interesting to philatelists as are commemoratives. A good example would be the US [[Series of 1902 (United States postage stamps)|1903 regular issues]], their designs being very picturesque and ornamental.&lt;ref name="Scotts1903"/&gt; Definitive stamps are often issued in a series of stamps with different [[Denomination (postage stamp)|denominations]].
[[File:Stamps first 1898-99 Stamps FILIPINO.jpg|thumb|Stamps of the [[First Philippine Republic|Philippine Republic]].]]
* [[Express mail]] stamp / [[Special delivery (postal service)|special delivery]] stamp.
* ''Late fee stamp'' — issued to show payment of a fee to allow inclusion of a letter or package in the outgoing dispatch although it has been turned in after the cut-off time.
* [[Local post]] stamps — used on mail in a local post; a postal service that operates only within a limited geographical area, typically a city or a single transportation route. Some local posts have been operated by governments, while others, known as private local posts, have been operated by for-profit companies.
* [[Make up stamp]] - a stamp with a very small value, used to make up the difference when postage rates are increased.
* [[Military stamp]] — stamp for a country’s [[armed forces]], usually using a special postal system.
* Minisheet — a  commemorative issue smaller than a regular full sheet of stamps, but with more than one stamp. Minisheets often contain a number of different stamps, and often having a decorative border. See also souvenir sheets.
[[Image:Zinnoberroter Merkur.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Red Mercury (newspaper stamp)|Red Mercury]], a rare 1856 [[newspaper stamp]] of Austria.]]
* [[Newspaper stamp]] — used to pay the cost of mailing [[newspaper]]s and other [[periodical]]s.
* [[Official mail]] stamp — issued for use by the government or a government agency.
* ''Occupation stamp'' — a stamp for use by an occupying army or by the occupying [[army]] or authorities for use by civilians
* [[Non-denominated postage]] — postage stamp that remains valid even after the price has risen. Also known as a permanent or "forever" stamp.
* [[Overprint]] - A regularly issued stamp, such as a commemorative or a definitive issue, that has been changed after issuance by "printing over" some part of the stamp. Denominations can be changed in this manner.
* [[Perfin|Perforated stamps]] — while this term usually refers to perforations around a stamp to divide a sheet into individual stamps, it can also be used for stamps perforated across the middle with letters or a pattern or monogram, which are known as "perfins." These modified stamps are usually purchased by corporations to guard against theft by employees.
* [[Personalised stamp]]s — allow the user to add his or her own image.
* [[Pneumatic tube|Pneumatic post]] stamps — for mail sent using pressurized air tubes, only produced in Italy.
* [[Postage currency]] postage stamps used as currency rather than as postage
* [[Postage due]] — a stamp showing that the full postage has not been paid, and indicating the amount owed. The United States Post Office Department has issued "parcel post postage due" stamps.
* ''Postal tax'' — a stamp indicating that a tax above the postage rate required for sending letters has been paid. This is often mandatory on mail issued on a particular day or for a few days.
* [[Self-adhesive stamp]] — not requiring moisture to stick. Self-sticking.
* [[Semi-postal]] / charity stamp — a stamp with an additional charge for charity. The use of semi-postal stamps is at the option of the purchaser. Countries such as [[Belgium]] and [[Switzerland]] that often use charitable fund-raising design stamps that are desirable for collectors.
* Souvenir sheet — a  commemorative issue in large format valid for postage often containing a perforated or imperforate stamp as part of its design.  See also minisheet.
* [[Specimen stamp]] — sent to postmasters and postal administrations so that they are able to identify valid stamps and to avoid forgeries.
* [[Test stamp]] — a label not valid for postage, used by postal authorities to test sorting and cancelling machines or machines that can detect a stamp on an envelope. May also be known as dummy or training stamps.
* [[Variable value stamp]]s - dispensed by machines that print the cost of the postage at the time the stamp is dispensed.
* [[War tax stamp]] — A variation on the postal tax stamp to defray the cost of war.
* [[Water-activated stamp]] — for many years, water-activated stamps were the only type available, so this term entered into use with the advent of self-adhesive stamps. The adhesive or gum on a water-activated stamp must be moistened (usually by licking, thus the stamps are also known as "lick and stick").

Apart from these, there are also [[Revenue stamp|Revenue]] (used to collect taxes or fees on items such as documents, tobacco, alcoholic drinks, hunting licenses and medicines) and [[Telegraph stamp]]s (for sending telegrams), which fall in a separate category from postage stamps.

==First day covers==
[[File:Abudhabi30mar1964fdc.jpg|thumb|right|A philatelic [[First Day Cover]] from Abu Dhabi.]]
{{Main|First day of issue}}
Postage stamps are first issued on a specific date, often referred to as the ''First day of issue.'' A ''[[first day cover]]'' usually consists of an envelope, a postage stamp and a postmark with the date of the stamp’s first day of issue thereon.&lt;ref name="FDC-Soc"&gt;[http://www.afdcs.org/fdccourse.html American First Day Cover Society]&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the mid-20th century some countries began assigning the first day of issue to a place associated with the subject of the stamp design, such as a specific town or city.&lt;ref name="Scotts-FDC"&gt;Scotts United States Stamp Catalogue, First Day of Issue Index.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two basic types of ''First Day Covers'' (FDCs) noted by collectors. The first and often most desirable type among advanced collectors is a cover sent through the mail in the course of everyday usage, without the intention of the envelope and stamp ever being retrieved and collected. The second type of FDC is often referred to as "Philatelic," that is, an envelope and stamp sent by someone with the intention of retrieving and collecting the mailed item at a later time and place. The envelope used for this type of FDC often bears a printed design or cachet of its own in correspondence with the stamp’s subject and is usually printed well in advance of the first day of issue date. The latter type of FDC is usually far more common, and is usually inexpensive and relatively easy to acquire. Covers that were sent without any secondary purpose are considered ''non-philatelic'' and often are much more challenging to find and collect.'&lt;ref name="FDC-Soc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotts-FDC"/&gt;

==Souvenir or miniature sheets==
[[File:Faroe stampsheet 153 Hafnia 1987 II - Torshavn, Western Bay.jpg|thumb|right|A 1987 Faroe Islands [[miniature sheet]], in which the stamps form a part of a larger image.]]
{{Main|Miniature sheet}}
Postage stamps are sometimes issued in [[souvenir sheet]]s or [[miniature sheet]]s containing one or a small number of stamps. Souvenir sheets typically include additional artwork or information printed on the [[selvage]], the border surrounding the stamps. Sometimes the stamps make up a greater picture. Some countries, and some issues, are produced as individual stamps as well as sheets.

==Stamp collecting==
{{Main|Stamp collecting}}
Stamp collecting is a popular [[hobby]]. Collecting is not the same as [[philately]], which is defined as the study of stamps. It is not necessary to closely study stamps in order to enjoy collecting them. Many casual collectors enjoy accumulating stamps without worrying about the details. The creation of a valuable or comprehensive collection, however, may require some philatelic knowledge.

Stamp collectors are an important source of [[revenue]] for some small countries that create limited runs of elaborate stamps designed mainly to be bought by stamp collectors. The stamps produced by these countries may far exceed their postal needs. Hundreds of countries, each producing scores of different stamps each year, resulted in 400,000 different types of stamps in existence by the year 2000. Annual world output averages about 10,000 types.
[[Image:François Barraud - Le Philateliste.jpg|right|thumb|''Le Philateliste'' by [[François Barraud]] (1929).]]
Some countries authorize the production of postage stamps that have no postal use,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the low value Afghanistan issues of 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; but are intended instead solely for collectors. Other countries issue large numbers of low denomination stamps that are bundled together in starter packs for new collectors.  ''Official reprints'' are often printed by companies who have purchased or contacted for those rights and such reprints see no postal use.&lt;ref name="Seebeck"&gt;[http://www.stampcollectingblog.com/seebeck-reprints.php The Stamp Collecting Blog, Seebeck reprints]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPM"&gt;[http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;tid=2035111 '''National Postal Museum'''] — Excerpt: ''Etheridge would have the remainders and reprint rights for the philatelic market. Etheridge sold these rights to Nicholas Seebeck, whose Hamilton Bank Note Company issued Ecuador’s 1892, 1894, and 1895 stamps.'' ...&lt;/ref&gt;  All of these stamps are often found "canceled to order", meaning they are postmarked without ever having passed through the postal system. Most national post offices produce stamps that would not be produced if there were no collectors, some to a far more prolific degree than others. It is up to individual collectors whether this concerns them; collecting such issues is as legitimate an endeavor as any other collection, but is unlikely to result in a collection of any value or to provide a monetary return on an investment (though it may be found worthwhile in other ways, such as teaching geography or collecting methods to a child, or sheer pleasure in the beauty of some of these issues). Others may argue that since these stamps are virtually worthless, they will be discarded in large numbers and eventually become less common and thus collectable in their own right, though this process would likely take many decades.

Sales of stamps to collectors who do not use them for mailing can result in large profits. Good examples of excessive issues have been (1) the stamps produced by [[Nicholas F. Seebeck]] and (2) stamps produced for the component states of the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Seebeck operated in the 1890s as an agent of [[Hamilton Bank Note Company]]. He approached Latin American countries with an offer to produce their entire postage stamp needs for free. In return he would have exclusive rights to market stamps to collectors. Each year a new issue would be produced, but would expire at the end of the year. This assured Seebeck of a continuing supply of remainders.&lt;ref name="Seebeck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPM"/&gt; In the 1960s, printers such as the Barody Stamp Company contracted to produce stamps for the separate Emirates and other countries. The sparse population of the desert states made it wholly unlikely that many of these stamps would ever be used for mailing purposes, and earned them the name of the "sand dune" countries. Another example of what might be considered by some to be excessive issues is that, at the time of the millennium, the United Kingdom issued 96 different stamps over about 24 months, all for pre-existing values with the same four rates for each set.

In the United States there is concern among some collectors that the United States Postal Service has become a promotional agent for the media and entertainment industry, as it has frequently issued entire sets of stamps featuring movie stars and cartoon characters like Mickey Mouse and Bart Simpson&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usps.com/communications/news/stamps/2004/sr04_076.htm USPS Stamp News, The 2005 Commemorative Stamp Program]&lt;/ref&gt;Over the decades the annual average number of new postage stamp issued by the U.S.P.S. has significantly increased.&lt;ref&gt;Scotts U.S. Stamp Catalogue&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sangita Kalanidhi]] '''Rallapalli Ananta Krishna Sharma''' ({{te|రాళ్ళపల్లి అనంతకృష్ణశర్మ}}) (23 January 1893 - 11 March 1979) was a noted composer of [[Carnatic music]], singer as well as a writer. He was a noted scholar in several languages like Telugu, Samkrit, Kannada &amp; Prakrit, and has written books &amp; poetry in these languages.&lt;ref&gt;Anantha Krishna Sharma Rallapalli, Luminaries of 20th Century, Part I, Potti Sriramulu Telugu University, Hyderabad, 2005, pp: 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, he was awarded the [[List of Sangeet Natak Akademi fellows|Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship]] the highest honour conferred by the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], India's National Academy of Music, Dance &amp; Drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sangeetnatak.gov.in/sna/fellowslist.htm|title=SNA: List of Sangeet Natak Akademi ''Ratna Puraskar''winners (Akademi Fellows)|publisher=Official website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206222925/http://www.sangeetnatak.gov.in/sna/fellowslist.htm|archivedate=6 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born on 23 January 1893 at Rallapalli village in [[Kambadur]] mandal of [[Anantapur district]], he was educated in Sanskrit, Telugu and Music by his parents, Karnamadakala Krishnamacharyulu and Alamelu Mangamma.

After moving to [[Mysore]], he sought instruction from the chief pontiff of the famous [[Parakala Mutt]]. Sharma studied Sanskrit and Prakrit languages at the Chamaraja Pathasala; and music with Chikka Rama Rao, Bidaram Krishnappa and Karigiri Rao.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/fr/2008/11/14/stories/2008111451360600.htm He turned the spotlight on Annamayya by Sriram Venkata Krishnan in The Hindu.]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1911, he married Rukminamma.

==Career==
[[File:Maharaja's College Group Photo 1.jpg|thumb|250px|Maharaja's College Faculty:Sitting row-left to right M.H.Krishna (third from left), A.R.Krishnasastry (fourth from left), S.Srikanta sastri (seventh from left), Rallapalli Anantha Krishna Sharma (eighth from left), Standing-bottom row-V. Seetharamaiah (fourth from left) and D.L.Narasimhachar (seventh from left)]]
Sharma was appointed a Telugu Pundit (a scholar) by Sir [[Cattamanchi Ramalinga Reddy]], Principal of the [[Maharaja College of Mysore]] in 1912 and worked until 1949.[[S. Srikanta Sastri#Rallapalli Anantha Krishna Sharma|(''group photo'')]] After which he joined the [[Sri Venkateswara University#Oriental Research Institute|Sri Venkateshwara Oriental Research Centre]], Tirupathi. The then executive officer of [[Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams]], [[Chelikani Anna Rao]] entrusted Sharma with elucidating the compositions of the great songwriter-singer-saint [[Tallapaka Annamacharya]]. These compositions (or kritis) were stored for centuries in the Tirumala temple Bhandagaram (storehouse) on copper plates. Sharma received the project after his predecessor, [[Veturi Prabhakara Sastry]] died. He singularly worked on tuning the songs and helped publish seventh and eighth volumes of Annamacharya's compositions. Sharma went on to edit nearly 300 compositions and brought out five more volumes of compositions between 1951 and 1956. He also wrote the notation for 108 compositions and 87 of them were published in the [[Andhra Patrika]]. Rallapalli Ananta Krishna Sharma was closely associated with eminent journalist, biographer and writer [[S. R. Ramaswamy]] who learnt for sometime the subtle nuances of Carnatic music from the maestro.

Sharma died on 11 March 1979 in [[Bangalore]] and was survived by three daughters and two sons. On 23 August 2008, his life-size bronze statue was installed in [[Tirupati (city)|Tirupathi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="838">In [[grammar]], '''reflexivity''' is a property of syntactic constructs whereby two arguments (actual or implicit) of an action or relation expressed by a single [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] have the same [[reference]].&lt;ref&gt;Routledge dictionary of language and linguistics By Hadumod Bussmann, Gregory Trauth, Kertin Kazzazi [https://books.google.com/books?id=rhvDiOxOUe4C&amp;pg=PA402&amp;dq=reflexivity+grammar&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lb9iTPTTOZL6sAOZkJj_Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=reflexivity%20grammar&amp;f=false, "Reflexivity]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflexivity may be expressed by means of: [[reflexive pronoun]]s or [[reflexive verb]]s. The latter ones may be constructed with the help of [[reflexive affix]]es (e.g., in Russian) or [[reflective particle]]s (e.g., in Polish).

[[File:Gati or existences.jpg|right|thumb|In [[Jainism]], a [[soul]] travels to any one of the four states of existence after death depending on its [[karma]]s.]]

'''Reincarnation''' is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]]  or [[Religion|religious]] concept that an aspect of a living [[being]] starts a new [[life]] in a different [[physical body]] or form after each biological [[death]]. It is also called rebirth or transmigration, and is a part of the [[Saṃsāra]] doctrine of cyclic existence.{{Sfn|Norman C.

Although the majority of denominations within [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] do not believe that individuals reincarnate, particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation; these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of [[Catharism|Cathars]], [[Alawites]], the [[Druze]],&lt;ref&gt;Hitti, Philip K (2007) [1924].

In recent decades, many [[Europeans]] and [[North Americans]] have developed an interest in reincarnation,&lt;ref name="hi.is"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hi.is/~erlendur/english/Nordic_Psychology_erlhar06.pdf |title=Popular psychology, belief in life after death and reincarnation in the Nordic countries, Western and Eastern Europe }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(54.8&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Reincarnation in popular culture|many contemporary works]] mention it.

==Conceptual definitions==
The word "reincarnation" derives from [[Latin]], literally meaning, "entering the flesh again". The Greek equivalent ''[[metempsychosis]]'' (μετεμψύχωσις) derives from ''meta'' (change) and ''empsykhoun'' (to put a soul into),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=metempsychosis metempsychosis], Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; a term attributed to [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Huffman (2014), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pythagoras/ Pythagoras, 4.1 The Fate of the Soul—Metempsychosis] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Stanford University&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate term is transmigration implying migration from one life (body) to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transmigration|author=Oxford Dictionaries|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/transmigrate|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reincarnation refers to the belief that an aspect of every human being (or all living beings in some cultures) continues to exist after death, this aspect may be the soul or mind or consciousness or something transcendent which is reborn in an interconnected cycle of existence; the transmigration belief varies by culture, and is envisioned to be in the form of a newly born human being, or animal, or plant, or spirit, or as a being in some other non-human realm of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/reincarnation |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Concise.britannica.com |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Keown|2013|pp=35–40}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Key Chapple|title=Jainism and Ecology: Nonviolence in the Web of Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abLZNdYxay8C |year=2006|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2045-6 |pages=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been used by modern philosophers such as [[Kurt Gödel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karl Sigmund |url=http://www.goedelexhibition.at/goedel/goedel.html |title=Gödel Exhibition: Gödel's Century |publisher=Goedelexhibition.at |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has entered the English language. Another Greek term sometimes used synonymously is ''[[palingenesis]]'', "being born again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hinduism.iskcon.com/concepts/102.htm |title=Heart of Hinduism: Reincarnation and Samsara |publisher=Hinduism.iskcon.com |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419232238/http://hinduism.iskcon.com/concepts/102.htm |archivedate=2011-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebirth is a key concept found in major Indian religions, and discussed with various terms. ''Punarjanman'' (Sanskrit: पुनर्जन्मन्) means "rebirth, transmigration".&lt;ref name="Monier-Williams582"&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ|year=1872|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Wesley Neufeldt|title=Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaRWtgXjplQC&amp;pg=PA106|year=1986|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-87395-990-2|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reincarnation is discussed in the ancient Sanskrit texts of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, with many alternate terms such as ''punarāvṛtti'' (पुनरावृत्ति), ''punarājāti'' (पुनराजाति), ''punarjīvātu'' (पुनर्जीवातु), ''punarbhava'' (पुनर्भव), ''āgati-gati'' (आगति-गति, common in Buddhist Pali text), ''nibbattin'' (निब्बत्तिन्), ''upapatti'' (उपपत्ति), and ''uppajjana'' (उप्पज्जन).&lt;ref name="Monier-Williams582"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids |author2=William Stede |title=Pali-English Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC |year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7 |pages=95, 144, 151, 361, 475 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These religions believe that this reincarnation is cyclic and an endless [[Saṃsāra]], unless one gains spiritual insights that ends this cycle leading to liberation.{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271–272}}{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|pp=90–99}} The reincarnation concept is considered in Indian religions as a step that starts each "cycle of aimless drifting, wandering or mundane existence",{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271–272}} but one that is an opportunity to seek spiritual liberation through ethical living and a variety of meditative, yogic (''marga''), or other spiritual practices.{{Sfn|John Bowker|2014|pp=84–85}}&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Flood (2010), Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Volume II, Brill, {{ISBN|978-90-04-17893-9}}, pages 881–884&lt;/ref&gt; They consider the release from the cycle of reincarnations as the ultimate spiritual goal, and call the liberation by terms such as [[moksha]], [[nirvana]], ''mukti'' and ''kaivalya''.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier, Mokṣa and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1985), pages 61–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman E.

Série in-8°, Fasc. 61, Édition-Diffusion de Boccard (Paris), {{ISBN|978-2868030610}}, pages 1–9&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Buddhist, Hindu and Jain traditions have differed, since ancient times, in their assumptions and in their details on what reincarnates, how reincarnation occurs and what leads to liberation.{{Sfn|Obeyesekere|2005|p=1-2, 108, 126–128}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=272–273}}

''Gilgul'', ''Gilgul neshamot'' or ''Gilgulei Ha Neshamot'' ([[Hebrew language|Heb.]] גלגול הנשמות) is the concept of reincarnation in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] [[Judaism]], found in much [[Yiddish literature]] among [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. ''Gilgul'' means "cycle" and ''neshamot'' is "souls". Kabbalistic reincarnation says that humans reincarnate only to humans and to the same sex only: men to men, women to women.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==History==

===Origins===

The origins of the notion of reincarnation are obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Theosophical Society in America|title=Reincarnation: The Hope of the World|page=15|author=Irving Steiger Cooper|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion of the subject appears in the philosophical traditions of India. The Greek [[Pre-Socratics]] discussed reincarnation, and the Celtic [[Druids]] are also reported to have taught a doctrine of reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]] thought the Druids might have been influenced by the teachings of [[Pythagoras]]. Diodorus Siculus v.28.6; Hippolytus ''Philosophumena'' i.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas associated with reincarnation may have arisen independently in different regions, or they might have spread as a result of cultural contact. Proponents of cultural transmission have looked for links between Iron Age Celtic, Greek and Vedic philosophy and religion,&lt;ref&gt;one modern scholar has speculated that Buddhist missionaries had been sent to Britain by the Indian king [[Ashoka]]. Donald A.Mackenzie, ''Buddhism in pre-Christian Britain'' (1928:21).&lt;/ref&gt; some{{who|date=October 2010}} even suggesting that belief in reincarnation was present in [[Proto-Indo-European religion]].{{dubious|date=October 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;M. Dillon and N. Chadwick, ''The Celtic Realms'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London, {{Page needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient European, Iranian and Indian agricultural cultures, the life cycles of birth, death, and rebirth were recognized as a replica of natural [[agricultural cycle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ara, Mitra (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ12k9delf4C Eschatology in the Indo-Iranian traditions: The Genesis and Transformation of a Doctrine]''. Peter Lang Publishing Inc., New York, USA. {{ISBN|1-4331-0250-1}}. pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism===

The idea of reincarnation has early roots in the [[Vedic period]] (c. 1500 – c. 500 BCE), predating the [[Buddha]] and the [[Mahavira]].&lt;ref name=damienkeown32&gt;{{cite book|author=Damien Keown |title=Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QXX0Uq29aoC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-966383-5 |pages=28, 32–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of the cycle of birth and death, [[samsara]], and liberation partly derive from ascetic traditions that arose in India around the middle of the first millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin. Olivelle, Patrick. 2003. ''The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism.'' Malden: Blackwell. pg. 273-4. "The second half of the first millennium BCE was the period that created many of the ideological and institutional elements that characterize later Indian religions. The renouncer tradition played a central role during this formative period of Indian religious history....Some of the fundamental values and beliefs that we generally associate with Indian religions in general and Hinduism in particular were in part the creation of the renouncer tradition. These include the two pillars of Indian theologies: samsara – the belief that life in this world is one of suffering and subject to repeated deaths and births (rebirth); moksa/nirvana – the goal of human existence....."&lt;/ref&gt; Though no direct evidence of this has been found, the tribes of the [[Ganges]] valley or the [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] traditions of [[South India]] have been proposed as another early source of reincarnation beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin D. Flood, ''An Introduction to Hinduism'', Cambridge University Press (1996), UK {{ISBN|0-521-43878-0}}  p. 86 – "A third alternative is that the origin of transmigration theory lies outside of vedic or sramana traditions in the tribal religions of the Ganges valley, or even in Dravidian traditions of south India."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hinduism]]'s [[Rigveda]] makes references to reincarnation in the [[Brahmana]]s layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Doctrine of Karma | publisher=Motilal Barnasidass | author=Krishnan, Yuvraj | year=1997 | location=Delhi, IN | pages=13 | isbn=81-208-1233-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |pages=147–148 |year = 1926 |url= https://archive.org/stream/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926#page/n181/mode/2up |quote= '''Quote:''' There we definitely know that the whole hymn is address to a departed spirit, and the poet [of the Rigvedic hymn] says that he is going to recall the departed soul in order that it may return again and live."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Atsushi Hayakawa |title=Circulation of Fire in the Veda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7LtAgAAQBAJ |year=2014| publisher=LIT Verlag Münster| isbn=978-3-643-90472-0| pages=66–67, 101–103 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though these early textual layers of the Vedas, from 2nd millennium BCE, mention and anticipate the doctrine of [[Karma]] and rebirth, the idea is not fully developed.{{sfn|Stephen J.

Laumakis|2008|pp=90–99}}

The texts of ancient [[Jainism]] that have survived into the modern era are post-Mahavira, likely from the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE, and extensively mention rebirth and karma doctrines.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=217–236}}&lt;ref name=dundasp14&gt;{{cite book|author= Paul Dundas|title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055 |pages= 14–16, 102–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jaina philosophy assumes that the soul (''Jiva'' in Jainism, ''Atman'' in Hinduism) exists and is eternal, passing through cycles of transmigration and rebirth.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=226-228}} After death, reincarnation into a new body is asserted to be instantaneous in early Jaina texts.&lt;ref name=dundasp14/&gt; Depending upon the accumulated karma, rebirth occurs into a higher or lower bodily form, either in heaven or hell or earthly realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kristi L.

The [[Buddhist texts#Texts of the Early schools|early Buddhist texts]] discuss rebirth as part of the doctrine of ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|Saṃsāra]]''.

====Rationale====
The earliest layers of Vedic text incorporate the concept of life, followed by an [[afterlife]] in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues (merit) or vices (demerit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[James Hastings]]|author2=John Alexander Selbie|author3=[[Louis Herbert Gray]]|series=[[Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics]]|title=Volume 12: Suffering-Zwingli|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.500005|year=1922|publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark|pages=616–618}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ancient Vedic [[Rishi]]s challenged this idea of afterlife as simplistic, because people do not live an equally moral or immoral life. Between generally virtuous lives, some are more virtuous; while evil too has degrees, and the texts assert that it would be unfair for people, with varying degrees of virtue or vices, to end up in heaven or hell, in "either or" and disproportionate manner irrespective of how virtuous or vicious their lives were.{{Sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|pp=84–86}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kusum P.

===Early Greece===

Early Greek discussion of the concept likewise dates to the 6th century BCE. An early Greek thinker known to have considered rebirth is [[Pherecydes of Syros]] (fl. 540 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Schibli, S., Hermann, Pherekydes of Syros, p. 104, Oxford Univ. Press 2001&lt;/ref&gt; His younger contemporary Pythagoras (c. 570–c. 495 BCE&lt;ref&gt;"The dates of his life cannot be fixed exactly, but assuming the approximate correctness of the statement of Aristoxenus (ap. Porph. ''V.P.'' 9) that he left Samos to escape the tyranny of Polycrates at the age of forty, we may put his birth round about 570 BCE, or a few years earlier. The length of his life was variously estimated in antiquity, but it is agreed that he lived to a fairly ripe old age, and most probably he died at about seventy-five or eighty." [[William Keith Chambers Guthrie]], (1978), ''A history of Greek philosophy, Volume 1: The earlier Presocratics and the Pythagoreans'', page 173. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;), its first famous exponent, instituted societies for its diffusion. [[Plato]] (428/427–348/347 BCE) presented accounts of reincarnation in his works, particularly the ''[[Myth of Er]]''.

Authorities have not agreed on how the notion arose in Greece: sometimes Pythagoras is said to have been Pherecydes' pupil, sometimes to have introduced it with the doctrine of [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]], a [[Thrace|Thracian]] religion that was to be important in the diffusion of reincarnation, or else to have brought the teaching from India. In  ''[[Phaedo]]'', Plato makes his teacher [[Socrates]], prior to his death, state: "I am confident that there truly is such a thing as living again, and that the living spring from the dead." However [[Xenophon]] does not mention Socrates as believing in reincarnation and Plato may have systematised Socrates' thought with concepts he took directly from Pythagoreanism or Orphism.

===Classical Antiquity===

{{see also|metempsychosis}}

The [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic religion]], which taught reincarnation, about the 6th century BC, organized itself into [[mystery schools]] at [[Eleusis]] and elsewhere, and produced a copious literature.&lt;ref&gt;Linforth, Ivan M. (1941) ''The Arts of Orpheus'' Arno Press, New York, {{OCLC|514515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, Herbert S. (1948) ''A Study of the doctrine of metempsychosis in Greece, from Pythagoras to Plato'' (Long's 1942 Ph.D. dissertation) Princeton, New Jersey, {{OCLC|1472399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, Herbert S. (16 February 1948) "Plato's Doctrine of Metempsychosis and Its Source" ''The Classical Weekly'' 41(10): pp. 149—155&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orpheus]], its legendary founder, is said to have taught that the immortal soul aspires to freedom while the body holds it prisoner. The wheel of birth revolves, the soul alternates between freedom and captivity round the wide circle of necessity. Orpheus proclaimed the need of the grace of the gods, [[Dionysus]] in particular, and of self-purification until the soul has completed the spiral ascent of destiny to live for ever.

An association between [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean philosophy]] and reincarnation was routinely accepted throughout antiquity. In the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' Plato makes Socrates tell how Er, the son of Armenius, miraculously returned to life on the twelfth day after death and recounted the secrets of the other world. There are myths and theories to the same effect in other dialogues, in the [[Chariot allegory]] of the [[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]], in the [[Meno]], [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]] and [[Laws]]. The soul, once separated from the body, spends an indeterminate amount of time in "formland" (see The [[Allegory of the Cave]] in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'') and then assumes another body.

In later Greek literature the doctrine is mentioned in a fragment of [[Menander]]&lt;ref&gt;Menander, ''The Inspired Woman''&lt;/ref&gt; and satirized by [[Lucian]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Gallus'', 18 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] literature it is found as early as [[Ennius]],&lt;ref&gt;Poesch, Jessie (1962) "Ennius and Basinio of Parma" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' 25(1/2): pp. 116—118, page 117, FN15&lt;/ref&gt; who, in a lost passage of his ''Annals'', told how he had seen [[Homer]] in a dream, who had assured him that the same soul which had animated both the poets had once belonged to a peacock. [[Persius]] in his satires (vi. 9) laughs at this, it is referred to also by [[Lucretius]]&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius, (i. 124)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Horace]].&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Epistles'', II. i. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Virgil]] works the idea into his account of the Underworld in the sixth book of the [[Aeneid]].&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''The Aeneid'', vv. 724 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; It persists down to the late classic thinkers, [[Plotinus]] and the other [[Neoplatonist]]s. In the [[Hermetica]], a Graeco-Egyptian series of writings on cosmology and spirituality attributed to [[Hermes Trismegistus]]/[[Thoth]], the doctrine of reincarnation is central.

In [[Hellenistic philosophy|Greco-Roman thought]], the concept of metempsychosis disappeared with the rise of [[Early Christianity]], reincarnation being incompatible with the Christian core doctrine of [[salvation]] of the faithful after death. It has been suggested that some of the early Church Fathers, especially [[Origen]], still entertained a belief in the possibility of reincarnation, but evidence is tenuous, and the writings of Origen as they have come down to us speak explicitly against it.&lt;ref&gt;The book ''Reincarnation in Christianity'', by the [[theosophist]] Geddes MacGregor (1978) asserted that Origen believed in reincarnation.  MacGregor is convinced that Origen believed in and taught about reincarnation but that his texts written about the subject have been destroyed. He admits that there is no extant proof for that position. The allegation was also repeated by [[Shirley MacLaine]] in her book ''Out On a Limb''.
Origen does discuss  the concept of transmigration (''metensomatosis'') from Greek philosophy, but it is repeatedly stated that this concept is not a part of the Christian teaching or scripture in his Comment on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (which survives only in a 6th-century Latin translatio): "In this place [when Jesus said Elijah was come and referred to John the Baptist] it does not appear to me that by Elijah the soul is spoken of, lest I fall into the doctrine of [[Transmigration of the soul|transmigration]], which is foreign to the Church of God, and not handed down by the apostles, nor anywhere set forth in the scriptures" (13:1:46–53, see [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IX/Origen on Matthew/Origen's Commentary on Matthew/Book XIII|Commentary on Matthew, Book XIII]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early Christian [[Gnostic]] sects professed reincarnation. The [[Sethians]] and followers of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] believed in it.&lt;ref&gt;Much of this is documented in R.E. Slater's book ''Paradise Reconsidered.''&lt;/ref&gt; The followers of [[Bardaisan]] of [[Mesopotamia]], a sect of the 2nd century deemed heretical by the Catholic Church, drew upon [[Babylon|Chaldean]] [[astrology]], to which Bardaisan's son Harmonius, educated in Athens, added Greek ideas including a sort of metempsychosis. Another such teacher was [[Basilides]] (132–? CE/AD), known to us through the criticisms of [[Irenaeus]] and the work of [[Clement of Alexandria]] (see also [[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]] and [[Buddhism and Gnosticism]]).

In the third Christian century [[Manichaeism]] spread both east and west from [[Babylonia]], then within the [[Sassanid Empire]], where its founder [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] lived about 216–276. Manichaean monasteries existed in Rome in 312 AD. Noting Mani's early travels to the [[Kushan Empire]] and other Buddhist influences in Manichaeism, [[Richard Foltz]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz]], ''Religions of the Silk Road'', New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; attributes Mani's teaching of reincarnation to Buddhist influence. However the inter-relation of Manicheanism, Orphism, Gnosticism and neo-Platonism is far from clear.

===Celtic paganism===
In the 1st century BCE [[Alexander Cornelius Polyhistor]] wrote:

{{bquote|The Pythagorean doctrine prevails among the Gauls' teaching that the souls of men are immortal, and that after a fixed number of years they will enter into another body.}}

[[Julius Caesar]] recorded that the [[druids]] of Gaul, Britain and Ireland had metempsychosis as one of their core doctrines:&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, "De Bello Gallico", VI&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote|The principal point of their doctrine is that the soul does not die and that after death it passes from one body into another... the main object of all education is, in their opinion, to imbue their scholars with a firm belief in the indestructibility of the human soul, which, according to their belief, merely passes at death from one tenement to another; for by such doctrine alone, they say, which robs death of all its terrors, can the highest form of human courage be developed.}}

===Germanic paganism===
{{Main|Rebirth in Germanic paganism}}
[[Image:Ed0027.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sváfa]] holding the dying [[Helgi Hjörvarðsson|Helgi]] in their first incarnation of three, as depicted in an illustration published in 1893]]
Surviving North Germanic texts make several references to beliefs in reincarnation. The ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]'' states that belief in reincarnation was once widespread, but was at the time of the composition restricted to folk belief. In addition, scholars have identified a variety of references to reincarnation among the Germanic peoples outside the North Germanic sphere.

===Judaism===
The belief in reincarnation had first existed amongst Jewish mystics in the Ancient World, among whom differing explanations were given of the after-life, although with a universal belief in an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;''Essential Judaism: A Complete Guide to Beliefs, Customs &amp; Rituals'', By George Robinson, Simon and Schuster 2008, page 193&lt;/ref&gt; Today, reincarnation is an [[esoteric]] belief within many streams of modern Judaism.  Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism), teaches a belief in [[gilgul]], transmigration of souls, and hence the belief in reincarnation is universal in [[Hasidic Judaism]], which regards the Kabbalah as sacred and authoritative, and is also held as an esoteric belief within [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]. In [[Judaism]], the [[Zohar]], first published in the 13th century, discusses reincarnation at length, especially in the [[Torah]] portion "Balak." The most comprehensive [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] work on reincarnation, ''[[Shaar HaGilgulim]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Mind in the Balance: Meditation in Science, Buddhism, and Christianity", p. 104, by  B.

Chajes&lt;/ref&gt; was written by [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital|Chaim Vital]], based on the teachings of his mentor, the 16th century kabbalist [[Isaac Luria]], who was said to know the past lives of each person through his [[Ruach HaKodesh|semi-prophetic]] abilities. The 18th century Lithuanian master scholar and kabbalist, Rabbi Elijah, known as the [[Vilna Gaon]] (Elijah of Vilna), authored a commentary on the biblical [[Book of Jonah]] as an allegory of reincarnation.

The practice of conversion to Judaism is sometimes understood within Orthodox Judaism in terms of reincarnation. According to this school of thought in Judaism, when non-Jews are drawn to Judaism, it is because they had been Jews in a former life. Such souls may "wander among nations" through multiple lives, until they find their way back to Judaism, including through finding themselves born in a gentile family with a "lost" Jewish ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Tales of Reincarnation', By Yonasson Gershom, Yonasson Gershom, Jason Aronson, Incorporated, 31 Jan 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taoism===
[[Taoist]] documents from as early as the [[Han Dynasty]] claimed that [[Lao Tzu]] appeared on earth as different persons in different times beginning in the legendary era of [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]]. The (ca. 3rd century BC) ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Chuang Tzu]]'' states: "Birth is not a beginning; death is not an end. There is existence without limitation; there is continuity without a starting-point. Existence without limitation is Space. Continuity without a starting point is Time. There is birth, there is death, there is issuing forth, there is entering in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vMNI-aFtF4UC&amp;dq|title=Chuang Tzŭ: Mystic, Moralist, and Social Reformer (translated by Herbert Allen Giles)|year= 1889|page= 304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Middle Ages===
Around the 11–12th century in Europe, several reincarnationist movements were persecuted as heresies, through the establishment of the [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]] in the Latin west. These included the [[Cathar]], Paterene or Albigensian church of western Europe, the [[Paulician]] movement, which arose in Armenia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11583b.htm |title=Newadvent.org |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-02-01 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bogomils]] in [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''The Medieval Manichee: A Study of the Christian Dualist Heresy'', 1982, {{ISBN|0-521-28926-2}}, Cambridge University Press, ''The Bogomils'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=d1LGB7u5iD0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=mediaeval+manichee&amp;cd=1 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian sects such as the Bogomils and the Cathars, who professed reincarnation and other gnostic beliefs, were referred to as "Manichean", and are today sometimes described by scholars as "Neo-Manichean".&lt;ref&gt;For example Dondaine, Antoine. O.P. ''Un traite neo-manicheen du XIIIe siecle: Le Liber de duobus principiis, suivi d'un fragment de rituel Cathare'' (Rome: Institutum Historicum Fratrum Praedicatorum, 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; As there is no known Manichaean mythology or terminology in the writings of these groups there has been some dispute among historians as to whether these groups truly were descendants of Manichaeism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01267e.htm |title=Newadvent.org |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Renaissance and Early Modern period===
While reincarnation has been a matter of faith in some communities from an early date it has also frequently been argued for on principle, as Plato does when he argues that the number of souls must be finite because souls are indestructible,&lt;ref&gt;"the souls must always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will not diminish in number." Republic X, 611. The Republic of Plato By Plato, Benjamin Jowett Edition: 3 Published by Clarendon press, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Franklin]] held a similar view.&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to his friend [[George Whatley]] written May 23, 1785: Jennifer T. Kennedy, Death Effects: Revisiting the conceit of Franklin's ''Memoir'', ''Early American Literature'', 2001. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/25057231 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes such convictions, as in Socrates' case, arise from a more general personal faith, at other times from anecdotal evidence such as Plato makes Socrates offer in the ''Myth of Er''.

During the [[Renaissance]] translations of Plato, the [[Hermetica]] and other works fostered new European interest in reincarnation. [[Marsilio Ficino]]&lt;ref&gt;Marsilio Ficino, ''Platonic Theology'', 17.3–4&lt;/ref&gt; argued that Plato's references to reincarnation were intended allegorically, Shakespeare alluded to the doctrine of reincarnation&lt;ref&gt;"Again, Rosalind in "As You Like It" (Act III., Scene 2), says: ''I was never so be-rhimed that I can remember since Pythagoras's time, when I was an Irish rat"'' — alluding to the doctrine of the transmigration of souls." William H. Grattan Flood, quoted at [http://www.libraryireland.com/IrishMusic/XVII-2.php Libraryireland.com]&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Giordano Bruno]] was burned at the stake by authorities after being found guilty of heresy by the [[Roman Inquisition]] for his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Boulting, 1914. pp. 163–64&lt;/ref&gt; But the Greek philosophical works remained available and, particularly in north Europe, were discussed by groups such as the [[Cambridge Platonists]].

===19th to 20th centuries===
{{See also|#Reincarnation research}}

[[Image:Wm james.jpg|upright|thumb|right|American psychologist and philosopher [[William James]] (1842–1910) was an early psychical researcher.&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Arthur S. |authorlink= |author2=Berger, Joyce  |title=The Encyclopedia of Parapsychology and Psychical Research |publisher=Paragon House Publishers |year=1991 |pages= |isbn=1-55778-043-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

By the 19th century the philosophers [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, A: "Parerga und Paralipomena" (Eduard Grisebach edition), On Religion, Section 177&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nietzsche]]&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche and the Doctrine of Metempsychosis, in J. Urpeth &amp; J. Lippitt, ''Nietzsche and the Divine'',  Manchester: Clinamen, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; could access the Indian scriptures for discussion of the doctrine of reincarnation, which recommended itself to the [[American Transcendentalism|American Transcendentalists]] [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and was adapted by [[Francis Bowen]] into ''Christian Metempsychosis''.&lt;ref name="shirleymaclaine.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shirleymaclaine.com/articles/reincarnation/article-318 |title=Shirleymaclaine.com |publisher=Shirleymaclaine.com |accessdate=2011-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106160539/http://www.shirleymaclaine.com/articles/reincarnation/article-318 |archive-date=2011-11-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 20th century, interest in reincarnation had been introduced into the nascent discipline of [[psychology]], largely due to the influence of [[William James]], who raised aspects of the [[philosophy of mind]], [[comparative religion]], the psychology of religious experience and the nature of empiricism.&lt;ref&gt;David Hammerman, Lisa Lenard, ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Reincarnation'', Penguin, p.34. For relevant works by James, see; William James, ''Human Immortality: Two Supposed Objections to the Doctrine (the Ingersoll Lecture, 1897)'', ''The Will to Believe, Human Immortality'' (1956) Dover Publications, {{ISBN|0-486-20291-7}}, ''The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature'' (1902), {{ISBN|0-14-039034-0}}, ''Essays in Radical Empiricism'' (1912) Dover Publications 2003, {{ISBN|0-486-43094-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; James was influential in the founding of the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] (ASPR) in [[New York City]] in 1885, three years after the British [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR) was inaugurated in London,&lt;ref name="Berger"/&gt; leading to systematic, critical investigation of paranormal phenomena.

At this time popular awareness of the idea of reincarnation was boosted by the [[Theosophical Society]]'s dissemination of systematised and universalised Indian concepts and also by the influence of magical societies like [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|The Golden Dawn]]. Notable personalities like [[Annie Besant]], [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Dion Fortune]] made the subject almost as [[Reincarnation in popular culture|familiar an element of the popular culture]] of the west as of the east. By 1924 the subject could be satirised in popular children's books.&lt;ref&gt;Richmal Crompton, ''More William'', George Newnes, London, 1924, XIII. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17125/17125-h/17125-h.htm William and the Ancient Souls]; "The memory usually came in a flash. For instance, you might remember in a flash when you were looking at a box of matches that you had been Guy Fawkes."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Théodore Flournoy]] was among the first to study a claim of past-life recall in the course of his investigation of the medium [[Hélène Smith]], published in 1900, in which he defined the possibility of [[cryptomnesia]] in such accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Théodore Flournoy, [http://www.psychanalyse-paris.com/-Des-Indes-a-la-planete-Mars-.html Des Indes à la planète Mars], Étude sur un cas de somnambulisme avec glossolalie, Éditions Alcan et Eggimann, Paris et Genève, 1900&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Carl Gustav Jung]], like Flournoy based in Switzerland, also emulated him in his thesis based on a study of cryptomnesia in psychism. Later Jung would emphasise the importance of the persistence of memory and ego in psychological study of reincarnation: "This concept of rebirth necessarily implies the continuity of personality... (that) one is able, at least potentially, to remember that one has lived through previous existences, and that these existences were one's own...."&lt;ref name="shirleymaclaine.com"/&gt; [[Hypnosis]], used in [[psychoanalysis]] for retrieving  forgotten memories, was eventually tried as a means of studying the phenomenon of past life recall.

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] states:

{{bquote|
Just as in the body childhood, adulthood and old age happen to an embodied being. So also he (the embodied being) acquires another body. The wise one is not deluded about this. – (2:13){{Sfn| Chapple|2010|p=98}}

As, after casting away worn out garments, a man later takes new ones. So after casting away worn out bodies, the embodied Self encounters other new ones. – (2:22){{Sfn| Chapple|2010|p=107}}

When an embodied being transcends, these three qualities which are the source of the body. Released from birth, death, old age and pain, he attains immortality. – (14:20){{Sfn| Chapple|2010|p=582}}
}}

There are internal differences within Hindu traditions on reincarnation and the state of moksha. For example, the dualistic devotional traditions such as [[Madhvacharya]]'s Dvaita Vedanta tradition of Hinduism champion a theistic premise, assert that human soul and Brahman are different, loving devotion to Brahman (god Vishnu in Madhvacharya's theology) is the means to release from Samsara, it is the grace of God which leads to moksha, and spiritual liberation is achievable only in after-life (''videhamukti'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeaneane D.

Buddhist traditions also vary in their mechanistic details on rebirth. [[Theravada]] Buddhists assert that rebirth is immediate while the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] schools hold to the notion of a ''[[bardo]]'' (intermediate state) that can last up to 49 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

Within Japanese [[Zen]], reincarnation is accepted by some, but rejected by others. A distinction can be drawn between "folk Zen", as in the Zen practiced by devotional lay people, and "philosophical Zen". Folk Zen generally accepts the various supernatural elements of Buddhism such as rebirth. Philosophical Zen, however, places more emphasis on the present moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=McClelland|first=Norman C.|title=Encyclopedia of Reincarnation and Karma|page=281|year=2010|isbn=9780786456758|publisher=McFarland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=warner&gt;{{citation|last=Warner|first=Brad|title=Hardcore Zen|isbn= 9780861719891|publisher=Wisdom Publications|year=2005|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some schools conclude that [[karma]] continues to exist and adhere to the person until it works out its consequences. For the [[Sautrantika]] school, each act "perfumes" the individual or "plants a seed" that later germinates. Tibetan Buddhism stresses the state of mind at the time of death. To die with a peaceful mind will stimulate a virtuous seed and a fortunate rebirth; a disturbed mind will stimulate a non-virtuous seed and an unfortunate rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;''Transform Your Life'': A Blissful Journey, page 52), [[Tharpa Publications]] (2001, US ed. 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-9789067-4-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
{{Further information|Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Karma in Jainism}}
[[File:Seven Jain Hells.jpg|thumb|right|200px|17th-century cloth painting depicting seven levels of [[Naraka (Jainism)|Jain hell]] according to [[Jain cosmology]]. Left panel depicts the demi-god and his animal vehicle presiding over each hell.]]
In [[Jainism]], the reincarnation doctrine, along with its theories of ''Saṃsāra'' and Karma, are central to its theological foundations, as evidenced by the extensive literature on it in the major sects of Jainism, and their pioneering ideas on these topics from the earliest times of the Jaina tradition.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=217–236}}&lt;ref name=dundasp14/&gt; Reincarnation in contemporary Jainism traditions is the belief that the worldly life is characterized by continuous rebirths and suffering in various realms of existence.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=226–228}}&lt;ref name="dundasp14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sethia2004p31"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tara Sethia |title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karma forms a central and fundamental part of Jain faith, being intricately connected to other of its philosophical concepts like transmigration, reincarnation, liberation, non-violence (''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahiṃsā]]'') and non-attachment, among others. Actions are seen to have consequences: some immediate, some delayed, even into future incarnations. So the doctrine of karma is not considered simply in relation to one life-time, but also in relation to both future incarnations and past lives.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp. 226–230&lt;/ref&gt; ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'' 3.3–4 states: "The ''jīva'' or the soul is sometimes born in [[devaloka|the world of gods]], sometimes in [[Naraka (Jainism)|hell]]. Sometimes it acquires the body of a [[asura|demon]]; all this happens on account of its karma. This ''jīva'' sometimes takes birth as a worm, as an insect or as an ant."&lt;ref name=krishan43&gt;Krishan, Yuvraj (1997): p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The text further states (32.7): "Karma is the root of birth and death. The souls bound by karma go round and round in the cycle of existence."&lt;ref name=krishan43 /&gt;

Actions and emotions in the current lifetime affect future incarnations depending on the nature of the particular karma. For example, a good and virtuous life indicates a latent desire to experience good and virtuous themes of life. Therefore, such a person attracts karma that ensures that his future births will allow him to experience and manifest his virtues and good feelings unhindered.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp.70–71&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, he may take birth in heaven or in a prosperous and virtuous human family. On the other hand, a person who has indulged in immoral deeds, or with a cruel disposition, indicates a latent desire to experience cruel themes of life.&lt;ref name=Kuhn64&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp.64–66&lt;/ref&gt; As a natural consequence, he will attract karma which will ensure that he is reincarnated in hell, or in lower life forms, to enable his soul to experience the cruel themes of life.&lt;ref name=Kuhn64/&gt;

There is no retribution, judgment or reward involved but a natural consequences of the choices in life made either knowingly or unknowingly. Hence, whatever suffering or pleasure that a soul may be experiencing in its present life is on account of choices that it has made in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p.15&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this doctrine, Jainism attributes supreme importance to pure thinking and moral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, Aidan (2006) p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain texts postulate four ''gatis'', that is states-of-existence or birth-categories, within which the soul transmigrates. The four ''gatis'' are: ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' (demi-gods), ''manuṣya'' (humans), ''[[Naraka (Jainism)|nāraki]]'' (hell beings) and ''tiryañca'' (animals, plants and micro-organisms).&lt;ref name=Jaini108&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) p.108&lt;/ref&gt; The four ''gatis'' have four corresponding realms or habitation levels in the vertically tiered [[Jain cosmology#Jain geography|Jain universe]]: demi-gods occupy the higher levels where the heavens are situated; humans, plants and animals occupy the middle levels; and hellish beings occupy the lower levels where seven hells are situated.&lt;ref name=Jaini108/&gt;

Single-sensed souls, however, called ''[[nigoda]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The Jain hierarchy of life classifies living beings on the basis of the senses: five-sensed beings like humans and animals are at the top, and single sensed beings like microbes and plants are at the bottom.&lt;/ref&gt; and element-bodied souls pervade all tiers of this universe. ''Nigodas'' are souls at the bottom end of the existential hierarchy. They are so tiny and undifferentiated, that they lack even individual bodies, living in colonies. According to Jain texts, this infinity of ''nigodas'' can also be found in plant tissues, root vegetables and animal bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) pp.108–09&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on its karma, a soul transmigrates and reincarnates within the scope of this cosmology of destinies. The four main destinies are further divided into sub-categories and still smaller sub-sub-categories. In all, Jain texts speak of a cycle of 8.4 million birth destinies in which souls find themselves again and again as they cycle within ''[[Samsara (Jainism)|samsara]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (2000) p.130&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jainism, God has no role to play in an individual's destiny; one's personal destiny is not seen as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment, but rather as a result of its own personal karma. A text from a volume of the ancient Jain canon, ''[[Vyakhyaprajnapti|Bhagvati sūtra]]'' 8.9.9, links specific states of existence to specific karmas. Violent deeds, killing of creatures having five sense organs, eating fish, and so on, lead to rebirth in hell. Deception, fraud and falsehood lead to rebirth in the animal and vegetable world. Kindness, compassion and humble character result in human birth; while austerities and the making and keeping of vows lead to rebirth in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, Yuvraj (1997) p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

Each soul is thus responsible for its own predicament, as well as its own salvation. Accumulated karma represent a sum total of all unfulfilled desires, attachments and aspirations of a soul.&lt;ref name=Kuhn28&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p.69&lt;/ref&gt; It enables the soul to experience the various themes of the lives that it desires to experience.&lt;ref name=Kuhn28 /&gt; Hence a soul may transmigrate from one life form to another for countless of years, taking with it the karma that it has earned, until it finds conditions that bring about the required fruits. In certain philosophies, heavens and hells are often viewed as places for eternal salvation or eternal damnation for good and bad deeds. But according to Jainism, such places, including the earth are simply the places which allow the soul to experience its unfulfilled karma.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp.65–66, 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{See also|Gilgul}}
{{Kabbalah||collapsed=1}}
Jewish mystical texts (the [[Kabbalah]]), from their classic Medieval canon onward, teach a belief in ''[[Gilgul Neshamot]]'' (Hebrew for metempsychosis of souls: literally "soul cycle", plural ''"gilgulim"''). The [[Zohar]] and the [[Sefer HaBahir]] specifically discuss reincarnation. It is a common belief in contemporary [[Hasidic Judaism]], which regards the Kabbalah as sacred and authoritative, though understood in light of a more [[Deveikut|innate]] psychological mysticism. Kabbalah also teaches that "The soul of Moses is reincarnated in every generation."&lt;ref&gt;Kabbalah for Dummies&lt;/ref&gt; Other, Non-Hasidic, [[Orthodox Jewish]] groups while not placing a heavy emphasis on reincarnation, do acknowledge it as a valid teaching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aish.com/jl-old/kc/48943926.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularization entered modern secular [[Yiddish literature]] and folk motif.

The 16th century mystical renaissance in communal [[Safed]] replaced scholastic [[Jewish philosophy|Rationalism]] as mainstream traditional Jewish theology, both in scholarly circles and in the popular imagination. References to ''gilgul'' in former Kabbalah became systematized as part of the metaphysical purpose of creation. [[Isaac Luria]] (the Ari) brought the issue to the centre of his new mystical articulation, for the first time, and advocated identification of the reincarnations of historic Jewish figures that were compiled by [[Haim Vital]] in his [[Shaar HaGilgulim]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sha'ar Ha'Gilgulim, The Gate of Reincarnations'', Chaim Vital&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gilgul'' is contrasted with the other processes in Kabbalah of [[Ibbur]] ("pregnancy"), the attachment of a second soul to an individual for (or by) good means, and [[Dybuk]] ("possession"), the attachment of a spirit, demon, etc. to an individual for (or by) "bad" means.

In Lurianic Kabbalah, reincarnation is not retributive or fatalistic, but an expression of Divine compassion, the microcosm of the doctrine of cosmic rectification of creation. ''Gilgul'' is a heavenly agreement with the individual soul, conditional upon circumstances. Luria's radical system focused on [[Tohu and Tikkun|rectification]] of the Divine soul, played out through Creation. The true essence of anything is the divine spark within that gives it existence. Even a stone or leaf possesses such a soul that "came into this world to receive a rectification". A human soul may occasionally be exiled into lower inanimate, vegetative or animal creations. The most basic component of the soul, the [[nefesh]], must leave at the cessation of blood production. There are four other soul components and different nations of the world possess different forms of souls with different purposes. Each Jewish soul is reincarnated in order to fulfill each of the [[613 Mitzvot|613 Mosaic commandments]] that elevate a particular spark of holiness associated with each commandment. Once all the Sparks are redeemed to their spiritual source, the [[Mashiach|Messianic Era]] begins. Non-Jewish observance of the [[7 Laws of Noah]] assists the Jewish people, though Biblical adversaries of Israel reincarnate to oppose.

Among the many rabbis who accepted reincarnation are [[Nahmanides]] (the Ramban) and Rabbenu [[Bahya ben Asher]], [[Levi ibn Habib]] (the Ralbah), [[Shelomoh Alkabez]], [[Moses Cordovero]], [[Moses Chaim Luzzatto]]; early Hasidic masters such as the [[Baal Shem Tov]], [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]] and [[Nachman of Breslov]], as well as virtually all later Hasidic masters;  contemporary Hasidic teachers such as DovBer Pinson and [[Moshe Weinberger]]; and key Mitnagdic leaders, such as the [[Vilna Gaon]] and [[Chaim Volozhin]] and their school, as well as Rabbi [[Shalom Sharabi]] (known at the RaShaSH), the [[Ben Ish Chai]] of Baghdad, [[Baba Sali]] and Rabbi [[Joel Landau (rabbi)|Joel Landau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://limmudbayarea2016.sched.com/event/7YDY/judaism-and-reincarnation|title=Limmud Bay Area 2016: Judaism and Reincarnation|website=limmudbayarea2016.sched.com|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbis who have rejected the idea include [[Saadia Gaon]], [[David Kimhi]], [[Hasdai Crescas]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Abraham ibn Daud]], [[Leon de Modena]], [[Solomon ben Aderet]], [[Maimonides]] and [[Asher ben Jehiel]]. Among the [[Geonim]], [[Hai Gaon]] argued in favour of ''gilgulim''.

===Sikhism===
Founded in the 15th century, Sikhism's founder [[Guru Nanak]] had a choice between the cyclical reincarnation concept of ancient Indian religions and the linear concept of early 7th-century Islam, and he chose the cyclical concept of time.&lt;ref name=colesambhi13&gt;{{cite book|author1=W.O.

The doctrines of Sikhism teach that the soul exists, and is passed from one body to another in endless cycles of [[Saṃsāra]], until liberation. Each birth begins with karma (''karam''), and these actions leave a ''karni'' (karmic signature) on one's soul which influences future rebirths, but it is God whose grace that liberates.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt; The way out of the reincarnation cycle, asserts Sikhism, is to live an ethical life, devote oneself to God and constantly remember God's name.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair |title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdhLAQAAQBAJ  |year=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-1-4411-0231-7 |pages=145–147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The precepts of Sikhism encourage the [[bhakti]] of One Lord for ''mukti'' (liberation).&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H.

The [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba believe]] in reincarnation within the family. The names Babatunde (Father returns), Yetunde (Mother returns), Babatunji (Father wakes once again) and Sotunde (The wise man returns) all offer vivid evidence of the Ifa concept of familial or lineal rebirth. There is no simple guarantee that your grandfather or great uncle will "come back" in the birth of your child, however.

Whenever the time arrives for a spirit to return to Earth (otherwise known as The Marketplace) through the conception of a new life in the direct bloodline of the family, one of the component entities of a person's being returns, while the other remains in Heaven (Ikole Orun). The spirit that returns does so in the form of a Guardian Ori. One's Guardian Ori, which is represented and contained in the crown of the head, represents not only the spirit and energy of one's previous blood relative, but the accumulated wisdom he or she has acquired through a myriad of lifetimes. This is not to be confused with one’s spiritual Ori, which contains personal destiny, but instead refers to the coming back to The Marketplace of one's personal blood Ori through one's new life and experiences.&lt;!--removed obvious promotional material &amp; link to that website--&gt;

The following is a story of human-to-human reincarnation as told by Thunder Cloud, a Winnebago ([[Ho-Chunk]] tribe) [[Shamanism|shaman]] referred to as T. C. in the narrative. Here T. C. talks about his two previous lives and how he died and came back again to this his third lifetime. He describes his time between lives, when he was “blessed” by Earth Maker and all the abiding spirits and given special powers, including the ability to heal the sick.

T. C.'s Account of His Two Reincarnations:

{{bquote|I ''(my ghost)'' was taken to the place where the sun sets ''(the west)''. ... While at that place, I thought I would come back to earth again, and the old man with whom I was staying said to me, “My son, did you not speak about wanting to go to the earth again?” I had, as a matter of fact, only thought of it, yet he knew what I wanted. Then he said to me, “You can go, but you must ask the chief first.” Then I went and told the chief of the village of my desire, and he said to me, “You may go and obtain your revenge upon the people who killed your relatives and you.” Then I was brought down to earth. ... There I lived until I died of old age. ... As I was lying [in my grave], someone said to me, “Come, let us go away.” So then we went toward the setting of the sun. There we came to a village where we met all the dead. ... From that place I came to this earth again for the third time, and here I am''.&lt;ref name=Jefferson2008 &gt;{{Cite book |last=Jefferson |first=Warren |year=2008 |title=Reincarnation beliefs of North American Indians : soul journeys, metamorphoses, and near-death experiences |publisher=Native Voices |isbn=1-57067-212-1 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/272306114}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Radin, 1923)}}

===Christianity===
In the major Christian denominations, the concept of reincarnation is absent and it is nowhere explicitly referred to in the Bible. However, in a survey by the Pew Forum in 2009, 24% of American Christians expressed a belief in reincarnation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ANALYSIS December 9, 2009 |url=http://pewforum.org/Other-Beliefs-and-Practices/Many-Americans-Mix-Multiple-Faiths.aspx |title=Pewforum.org |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=2009-12-09 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a 1981 survey 31% of regular churchgoing European Catholics expressed a belief in reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spirituale-wholeness.org/faqs/reinceur/reineuro.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010425113340/http://spiritual-wholeness.org/faqs/reinceur/reineuro.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-04-25 |title=Spiritual-wholeness.org |publisher=Spiritual-wholeness.org |accessdate=2011-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some Christian theologians interpret certain Biblical passages as referring to reincarnation. These passages include the questioning of Jesus as to whether he is Elijah, John the Baptist, Jeremiah, or another prophet (Matthew 16:13-15 and John 1:21-22) and, less clearly (while Elijah was said not to have died, but to have been taken up to heaven), John the Baptist being asked if he is not Elijah (John 1:25).&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Frieling, ''Christianity and Reincarnation'', Floris Books 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Albrecht, ''Reincarnation, a Christian Appraisal'', InterVarsity Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn A.

====The idea of reincarnation in the early Church fathers====
There is evidence&lt;ref&gt;"The Big Book of Reincarnation", by Roy Stemman, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; that [[Origen]], a [[Church father]] in early Christian times, taught reincarnation in his lifetime but that when his works were translated into Latin these references were concealed. One of the epistles written by [[St. Jerome]], "To Avitus" (Letter 124 ; Ad Avitum. Epistula CXXIV),&lt;ref name="mlat.uzh.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlat.uzh.ch/MLS/text.php?tabelle=Hieronymus_Stridonensis_cps2&amp;rumpfid=Hieronymus_Stridonensis_cps2,%20Epistolae,%20124,%20%20%20%20p0&amp;corpus=2&amp;lang=0&amp;current_title=EPISTOLA%20CXXIV.%20AD%20AVITUM.%20Quid%20cavendum%20in%20Libris%20%CF%80%CE%B5%CF%81%E1%BD%B6%20%E1%BC%80%CF%81%CF%87%E1%BF%B6%CE%BD.&amp;links=&amp;inframe=1|title=Hieronymus_Stridonensis_cps2, Epistolae, 124, p0|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which asserts that Origen's ''On First Principles'' (Latin: ''De Principiis''; Greek: Περὶ Ἀρχῶν&lt;ref name=Cross&gt;Cross, F. L., and Elizabeth A. Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (Second Edition). New York: Oxford University Press, 1984. p. 1009.&lt;/ref&gt;) was mistranscribed:

{{Quote| About ten years ago that saintly man [[Saint Pammachius|Pammachius]] sent me a copy of a certain person's [ [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]'s&lt;ref name="mlat.uzh.ch"/&gt; ] rendering, or rather misrendering, of Origen's ''First Principles''; with a request that in a Latin version I should give the true sense of the Greek and should set down the writer's words for good or for evil without bias in either direction. When I did as he wished and sent him the book, he was shocked to read it and locked it up in his desk lest being circulated it might wound the souls of many.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3001124.htm|title=Church Fathers: Letter 124 (Jerome)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Under the impression that Origen was a heretic like [[Arius]], St. Jerome criticizes ideas described in ''On First Principles''. Further in "To Avitus" (Letter 124), St. Jerome writes about "convincing proof" that Origen teaches reincarnation in the original version of the book:

{{Quote|The following passage is a convincing proof that he holds the transmigration of the souls and annihilation of bodies. 'If it can be shown that an incorporeal and reasonable being has life in itself independently of the body and that it is worse off in the body than out of it; then beyond a doubt bodies are only of secondary importance and arise from time to time to meet the varying conditions of reasonable creatures. Those who require bodies are clothed with them, and contrariwise, when fallen souls have lifted themselves up to better things, their bodies are once more annihilated. They are thus ever vanishing and ever reappearing.'&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;}}

The original text of ''On First Principles'' has almost completely disappeared.  It remains extant as ''De Principiis'' in fragments faithfully translated into Latin by St. Jerome and in "the not very reliable Latin translation of [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]."&lt;ref name=Cross /&gt;

===Islam===

McClelland |2010|pages=122–123 }} However, some Muslim minority sects such as those found among [[Sufism|Sufis]], and some Muslims in [[South Asia]] and [[Indonesia]] have retained their pre-Islamic Hindu and Buddhist beliefs in reincarnation.{{Sfn|Norman C. McClelland |2010|pages=122–123 }} For instance, historically, South Asian Isma'ilis performed [[Chanto|chantas]] yearly, one of which is for seeking forgiveness of sins committed in past lives. 

====Ghulat sects====
{{Shia Islam||collapsed=1}}
The idea of reincarnation is accepted by a few [[Shia]] [[Muslim]] sects, particularly of the [[Ghulat]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Peter Lamborn, ''Scandal: Essays in Islamic Heresy'', Brooklyn, NY: Autonomedia.

Reincarnation was also accepted by some streams of Sufism. Modern Sufis who embrace the idea include Bawa Muhaiyadeen.&lt;ref&gt;see his ''To Die Before Death: The Sufi Way of Life''&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Inayat Khan]] has criticized the idea as unhelpful to the spiritual seeker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnosticliberationfront.com/sufi_message_of_hazrat_inayat%20khan.htm Gnostic liberation front] The Sufi Message of Hazrat Inayat Khan&lt;/ref&gt;

===Druze===
{{Druze|collapsed=1}}
{{See also|Druze#Beliefs}}
Reincarnation is a paramount tenet in the [[Druze]] faith.&lt;ref&gt;Seabrook, W. B., ''Adventures in Arabia'', Harrap and Sons 1928, (chapters on Druze religion)&lt;/ref&gt; There is an eternal [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|duality]] of the body and the soul and it is impossible for the soul to exist without the body. Therefore, reincarnations occur instantly at one's death. While in the Hindu and Buddhist belief system a soul can be transmitted to any living creature, in the Druze belief system this is not possible and a human soul will only transfer to a human body. Furthermore, a male Druze can only be reincarnated as another male Druze and a female Druze can only be reincarnated as another female Druze. Additionally, souls cannot be divided and the number of souls existing is finite.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Dwairy, Marwan (2006) "The Psychosocial Function Of Reincarnation Among Druze In Israel" ''Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry,'' page 29 – 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few Druzes are able to recall their past but, if they are able to they are called a ''Nateq''. Typically souls who have died violent deaths in their previous incarnation will be able to recall memories. Since death is seen as a quick transient state, mourning is discouraged.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Unlike other Abrahamic faiths, heaven and hell are spiritual. Heaven is the ultimate happiness received when soul escapes the cycle of rebirths and reunites with the Creator, while hell is conceptualized as the bitterness of being unable to reunite with the Creator and escape from the cycle of rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=James |title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2002 |isbn=1615927387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New religious and spiritual movements===
{{Paranormal|state=collapsed}}

====Spiritism====
[[File:Tombe Allan Kardec.JPG|thumb|upright|Tomb of [[Allan Kardec]], founder of spiritism. The inscription says in French "To be born, die, again be reborn, and so progress unceasingly, such is the law".]]
[[Spiritism]], a Christian philosophy codified in the 19th century by the French educator [[Allan Kardec]], teaches reincarnation or rebirth into human life after death. According to this doctrine, free will and cause and effect are the corollaries of reincarnation, and reincarnation provides a mechanism for man's spiritual evolution in successive lives.&lt;ref name="Hess2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Hess|title=Spirits and Scientists: Ideology, Spiritism and Brazilian Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGxsfV-lTtEC&amp;pg=PA16|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=978-0-271-04080-6|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theosophy====
The [[Theosophical Society]] draws much of its inspiration from India. The idea is, according to a recent Theosophical writer, "the master-key to modern problems", including heredity.&lt;ref name="Theosophy and reincarnation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blavatskytrust.org.uk/html/wr_reincarnation.htm |title=Theosophy and reincarnation |publisher=Blavatskytrust.org.uk |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Theosophical world-view reincarnation is the vast rhythmic process by which the soul, the part of a person which belongs to the formless non-material and timeless worlds, unfolds its spiritual powers in the world and comes to know itself. It descends from sublime, free, spiritual realms and gathers experience through its effort to express itself in the world. Afterwards there is a withdrawal from the physical plane to successively higher levels of reality, in death, a purification and assimilation of the past life. Having cast off all instruments of personal experience it stands again in its spiritual and formless nature, ready to begin its next rhythmic manifestation, every lifetime bringing it closer to complete self-knowledge and self-expression. However it may attract old mental, emotional, and energetic ''karma'' patterns to form the new personality.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

====Modern astrology====
Inspired by [[Helena Blavatsky]]'s major works, including ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' and ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'', [[astrology|astrologers]] in the early twentieth-century integrated the concepts of [[karma]] and reincarnation into the practice of [[Western astrology]]. Notable astrologers who advanced this development included [[Alan Leo]], [[Charles E. O. Carter]], [[Marc Edmund Jones]], and [[Dane Rudhyar]]. A new synthesis of East and West resulted as Hindu and Buddhist concepts of reincarnation were fused with Western astrology's deep roots in [[Hermeticism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. In the case of Rudhyar, this synthesis was enhanced with the addition of [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] [[depth psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Jutta Woods. "The Theosophical Heritage in Modern Astrology." ''The Mountain Astrologer.'' Aug/Sept 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This dynamic integration of astrology, reincarnation and depth psychology has continued into the modern era with the work of astrologers [[Steven Forrest (astrologer)|Steven Forrest]] and Jeffrey Wolf Green.  Their respective schools of Evolutionary Astrology are based on "an acceptance of the fact that human beings incarnate in a succession of lifetimes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forrestastrology.com/about-us/about-evolutionary-astrology|title=About Evolutionary Astrology|author=Steven Forrest and Jeffrey Wolf Green|accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anthroposophy====
[[Anthroposophy]] describes reincarnation from the point of view of Western philosophy and culture. The ego is believed to transmute transient soul experiences into universals that form the basis for an individuality that can endure after death. These universals include ideas, which are intersubjective and thus transcend the purely personal (spiritual consciousness), intentionally formed human character (spiritual life), and becoming a fully conscious human being (spiritual humanity). [[Rudolf Steiner]] described both the general principles he believed to be operative in reincarnation, such as that one's will activity in one life forms the basis for the thinking of the next,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''Reincarnation and Karma'' by Steiner&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of successive lives of various individualities.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, ''Karmic Relationships'', volumes 1–6&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scientology====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Whole Track]] --&gt;
{{See also|Scientology beliefs and practices}}

Past reincarnation, usually termed "past lives", is a key part of the principles and practices of the [[Church of Scientology]]. Scientologists believe that the human individual is actually a ''[[thetan]]'', an immortal spiritual entity, that has fallen into a degraded state as a result of past-life experiences. Scientology [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] is intended to free the person of these past-life traumas and recover past-life memory, leading to a higher state of spiritual awareness. This idea is echoed in their highest fraternal religious order, the [[Sea Organization]], whose motto is "Revenimus" or "We Come Back", and whose members sign a "billion-year contract" as a sign of commitment to that ideal. [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the founder of Scientology, does not use the word "reincarnation" to describe its beliefs, noting that: "The common definition of reincarnation has been altered from its original meaning. The word has come to mean 'to be born again in different life forms' whereas its actual definition is 'to be born again into the flesh of another body.' Scientology ascribes to this latter, original definition of reincarnation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientology.org/html/opencms/cos/scientology/en_US/news-media/faq/pg016.html |title=Scientology Church &amp; Religion – What is Scientology? |work=Scientology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613231607/http://www.scientology.org/html/opencms/cos/scientology/en_US/news-media/faq/pg016.html |archivedate=2006-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first writings in Scientology regarding past lives date from around 1951 and slightly earlier. In 1960, Hubbard published a book on past lives entitled ''[[Have You Lived Before This Life]]''. In 1968 he wrote ''[[Mission into Time]]'', a report on a five-week sailing expedition to Sardinia, Sicily and Carthage to see if specific evidence could be found to substantiate L. Ron Hubbard's recall of incidents in his own past, centuries ago.

====Meher Baba====
The Indian spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] stated that reincarnation occurs due to desires and once those desires are extinguished the ego-mind ceases to reincarnate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967), [http://www.discoursesbymeherbaba.org ''Discourses''], Volume III, Sufism Reoriented, 1967, {{ISBN|1-880619-09-1}}, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wicca====

[[Wicca]] is a neo-pagan religion focused on nature, guided by the philosophy of [[Wiccan Rede]] that advocates the tenets "Harm None, Do As Ye Will". Wiccans believe in a form of karmic return where one's deeds are returned, either in the current life or in another life, threefold or multiple times in order to teach one lessons (The Threefold Law). Reincarnation is therefore an accepted part of the Wiccan faith.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Wicca and Witchcraft, Raven Grimassi&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=December 2016}} Wiccans also believe that death and afterlife are important experiences for the soul to transform and prepare for future lifetimes.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Reincarnation in the Western world==
During recent decades, many people in the West have developed an interest in reincarnation.&lt;ref name="hi.is"/&gt; Recent studies have indicated that some Westerners accept the idea of reincarnation&lt;ref name="hi.is" /&gt; including certain contemporary people who were from Catholic families,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Walter and Helen Waterhouse, "[http://socrel.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/2/187.full.pdf A Very Private Belief: Reincarnation in Contemporary England]". ''Sociology of Religion'', Vol. 60, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; modern [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]], followers of [[Spiritism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] and students of [[esotericism|esoteric]] philosophies such as [[Kabbalah]], and [[Gnostic]] and [[Esoteric Christianity]] as well as followers of Indian religions. Demographic survey data from 1999–2002 shows a significant minority of people from Europe and America, where there is reasonable freedom of thought and access to ideas but no outstanding recent reincarnationist tradition, believe we had a life before we were born, will survive death and be born again physically. The mean for the Nordic countries is 22%.&lt;ref name="surv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hi.is/~erlendur/english/Nordic_Psychology_erlhar06.pdf|title=Popular psychology, belief in life after death and reincarnation in the Nordic countries, Western and Eastern Europe|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief in reincarnation is particularly high in the Baltic countries, with [[Lithuania]] having the highest figure for the whole of [[Europe]], 44%. The lowest figure is in East Germany, 12%. In [[Russia]], about one-third believes in reincarnation. The effect of communist anti-religious ideas on the beliefs of the populations of [[Eastern Europe]] seems to have been rather slight, if any, except apparently in East Germany.&lt;ref name="surv" /&gt; Overall, 22% of respondents in [[Western Europe]] believe in reincarnation.&lt;ref name="surv" /&gt; According to a 2005 Gallup poll 20 percent of U.S. adults believe in reincarnation. Recent surveys by the Barna Group, a Christian research nonprofit organization, have found that a quarter of U.S. Christians, including 10 percent of all [[born again]] Christians, embrace the idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldmonitor.wordpress.com/2007/08/25/buddhism-china/]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dalailama1_20121014_4639.jpg|thumb|The [[14th Dalai Lama]] has stated his belief that it would be difficult for science to disprove reincarnation.]]
Skeptic [[Carl Sagan]] asked the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] what he would do if a fundamental tenet of his religion (reincarnation) were definitively disproved by science. The Dalai Lama answered, "If science can disprove reincarnation, Tibetan Buddhism would abandon reincarnation… but it's going to be mighty hard to disprove reincarnation."&lt;ref&gt;"The Boundaries of Knowledge in Buddhism, Christianity, and Science", by Paul David Numrich, p. 13, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, {{ISBN|9783525569870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Stevenson reported that belief in reincarnation is held (with variations in details) by adherents of almost all major religions except [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].  In addition, between 20 and 30 percent of persons in western countries who may be nominal Christians also believe in reincarnation.&lt;ref name=jh&gt;Jane Henry (2005).

One 1999 study by Walter and Waterhouse reviewed the previous data on the level of reincarnation belief and performed a set of thirty in-depth interviews in Britain among people who did not belong to a religion advocating reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors reported that surveys have found about one fifth to one quarter of Europeans have some level of belief in reincarnation, with similar results found in the USA. In the interviewed group, the belief in the existence of this phenomenon appeared independent of their age, or the type of religion that these people belonged to, with most being Christians. The beliefs of this group also did not appear to contain any more than usual of "new age" ideas (broadly defined) and the authors interpreted their ideas on reincarnation as "one way of tackling issues of suffering", but noted that this seemed to have little effect on their private lives.

Waterhouse also published a detailed discussion of beliefs expressed in the interviews.&lt;ref name=Waterhouse1999&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She noted that although most people "hold their belief in reincarnation quite lightly" and were unclear on the details of their ideas, personal experiences such as past-life memories and [[near-death experience]]s had influenced most believers, although only a few had direct experience of these phenomena. Waterhouse analyzed the influences of second-hand accounts of reincarnation, writing that most of the people in the survey had heard other people's accounts of past-lives from regression hypnosis and dreams and found these fascinating, feeling that there "must be something in it" if other people were having such experiences.

=={{Anchor|Reincarnation research}}Academic research into claims of reincarnation==
Psychiatrist [[Ian Stevenson]], from the [[University of Virginia]], having grown up with a mother who was a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]],&lt;ref name="Stevenson2006p13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf|title=Stevenson 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721165720/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf|archive-date=July 21, 2006|dead-url=yes|access-date=September 1, 2016|df=}}, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated his latter career to investigating claims of reincarnation in hopes of providing evidence that reincarnation happens. Other people who have undertaken similar pursuits include [[Jim B. Tucker]], [[Antonia Mills]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamesgmatlock.net/resources/researchers/mills/|title=Mills|work=Signs of Reincarnation}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Satwant Pasricha]], [[Godwin Samararatne]], and [[Erlendur Haraldsson]], but Stevenson's publications remain the most well-known.

Stevenson conducted more than 2,500 [[case study|case studies]] of young children who claimed to remember past lives over a period of 40 years and published twelve books, including ''[[Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation]]'', [[Reincarnation_and_Biology|Reincarnation and Biology: A Contribution to the Etiology of Birthmarks and Birth Defects, a two-part monograph]] and ''[[Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect]]''. He documented the family's and child's statements along with correlates to a [[deceased]] person he believed matched the child's memory. Stevenson also claimed that some [[birthmark]]s and [[birth defects]] matched wounds and scars on the deceased, sometimes providing [[medical records]] like [[autopsy]] photographs to make his case.&lt;ref&gt;Cadoret, Remi. [http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=177497 Book Review: European Cases of the Reincarnation Type] ''The American Journal of Psychiatry'', April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Expecting controversy and [[skepticism]], Stevenson also searched for disconfirming evidence and alternative explanations for the reports, but he argued (not without criticism) that his methods ruled out all possible "normal" explanations for the child’s memories.&lt;ref name="document"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Shroder | first = T | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/10/AR2007021001393.html?nav=hcmodule | title = Ian Stevenson; Sought To Document Memories Of Past Lives in Children | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 2007-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson's work in this regard was impressive enough to [[Carl Sagan]] that he referred to what was apparently Stevenson's investigations in his book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' as an example of carefully collected empirical data, though he rejected reincarnation as a parsimonious explanation for the stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Demon Haunted World|author=Sagan, Carl|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=1996|isbn=978-0-394-53512-8|location=|page=300|authorlink=Carl Sagan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] cited Stevenson's works in his book ''[[The End of Faith]]'' as part of a body of data that seems to attest to the reality of psychic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The End of Faith|last1=Harris|first1=Sam|date=September 17, 2005|publisher=W. W. Norton|isbn=0393327655|edition=Reprint|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critical reviews of these claims include work by [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]] who criticized the accounts of reincarnation as being purely [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]] and [[Cherry picking|cherry-picked]].&lt;ref name="skepticreport.com"&gt;Rockley, Richard. (2002). [http://www.skepticreport.com/sr/?p=482 "Book Review: Children who Remember Previous Lives"]. SkepticReport. Retrieved 2014-10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Edwards says such stories are attributable to [[selective thinking]], [[suggestion]], and [[false memory syndrome|false memories]] that can result from the family's or researcher's belief systems, and thus cannot be counted as [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Edwards, Paul]]. (1996, reprinted in 2001). ''Reincarnation: A Critical Examination''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Keith Augustine wrote in critique that the fact that "the vast majority of Stevenson's cases come from countries where a religious belief in reincarnation is strong, and rarely elsewhere, seems to indicate that cultural conditioning (rather than reincarnation) generates claims of spontaneous past-life memories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infidels.org/library/modern/keith_augustine/immortality.html|title=The Case Against Immortality|publisher=Infidels.org|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, [[Ian Wilson (author)|Ian Wilson]] pointed out that a large number of Stevenson’s cases consisted of poor children remembering wealthy lives or belonging to a [[Caste system in India|higher caste]]. In these societies, claims of reincarnation are sometimes used as schemes to obtain money from the richer families of alleged former incarnations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Wilson (author)|Wilson, Ian]]. (1981). ''Mind Out of Time: Reincarnation Investigated''. Gollancz. {{ISBN|0-575-02968-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these types of criticism, Stevenson published a book on ''[[European Cases of the Reincarnation Type]]'' in attempt to show the reports were cross-cultural. Even still, [[Robert A. Baker|Robert Baker]] explained that all the past-life experiences investigated by Stevenson and other parapsychologists are understandable in terms of known psychological factors including a mixture of [[cryptomnesia]] and [[confabulation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert A. Baker|Baker, Robert A]]. (1996). ''Hidden Memories: Voices and Visions from Within''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|0-87975-576-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards also noted that reincarnation invokes assumptions that are inconsistent with modern science.&lt;ref&gt;Cogan, Robert. (1998). ''Critical Thinking: Step by Step''. University Press of America. pp. 202–203. {{ISBN|0-7618-1067-6}} "Edwards catalogs common sense objections which have been made against reincarnation. 1) How does a soul exist between bodies? 2) Tertullian's objection: If there is reincarnation, why are not babies born with the mental abilities of adults? 3) Reincarnation claims an infinite series of prior incarnations. Evolution teaches that there was a time when humans did not yet exist. So reincarnation is inconsistent with modern science. 4) If there is reincarnation, then what is happening when the population increases? 5) If there is reincarnation, then why do so few, if any people, remember past lives?... To answer these objections believers in reincarnation must accept additional assumptions... Acceptance of these silly assumptions, Edwards says, amounts to a crucifixion of one's intellect."

* [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Edwards, Paul]]. (1996, reprinted in 2001). ''Reincarnation: A Critical Examination''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the vast majority of people do not remember previous lives and there is no empirically documented mechanism known that allows personality to survive death and travel to another body, positing the existence of reincarnation is subject to the principle that "[[extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence]]". Researchers such as Stevenson acknowledged these limitations.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/10/AR2007021001393.html?nav=hcmodule|title=Ian Stevenson; Sought To Document Memories Of Past Lives in Children|last=Shroder|first=Tom|date=2007-02-11|accessdate=2011-12-06|publisher=Washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevenson also claimed there were a handful of cases that suggested evidence of [[xenoglossy]], including two where a subject under hypnosis allegedly conversed with people speaking the foreign language, instead of merely being able to recite foreign words. [[Sarah Thomason]], a linguist at the University of Michigan, reanalyzed these cases, concluding that "the linguistic evidence is too weak to provide support for the claims of xenoglossy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Thomason|Thomason, Sarah G.]]. [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~thomason/papers/xenogl.pdf "Xenoglossy"]. In [[Gordon Stein]]. (1996). ''The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2666">'''Robert Constantin''' (1530 ?, [[Caen]] – 27 December 1605, [[Montauban]]) was a 16th-century French physician, hellenist, bibliographer, lexicographer and humanist.

== Biography ==
Robert Constantin studied and practiced the art of medicine and was a pupil of [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] (1484–1558), with whose children he worked in publishing his ''Poetics'' (Lyon, 1561). He taught at the [[University of Caen]], where he achieved a reputation as a Hellenist and physician and was alderman of Montauban from 1571, where he died in 1605.

Among other works, especially philological (corrections of [[Dioscorides]], [[Theophrastus]] and the ''De re medica'' by [[Celsus]], an edition of [[Hippocrates]] and others of [[Ausonius]]), but also of bibliographic character (composed with [[Conrad Gesner]] (1516-1565), the first [[bibliography]] published in French soil, the ''Nomenclator insignium scriptorium'', 1555). In [[lexicography]], the ''Lexicon Graeco-Latinum'' (1562) was, along the ''Thesaurus Linguae Graecae'' by [[Robert Estienne]], one of the most popular dictionaries for many centuries, whose composition was helped by [[Jean Crespin]]. The monumental second edition, 1592, was extended by [[Franciscus Portus]] (1511-1581) with important appendices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5987">[[File:CursivasRomanas.png|right|thumb|400px|''Roman cursive, old and new'']]
'''Roman cursive''' (or '''Latin cursive''') is a form of [[handwriting]] (or a [[script (styles of handwriting)|script]]) used in [[ancient Rome]] and to some extent into the [[Middle Ages]]. It is customarily divided into old (or ancient) cursive, and new cursive.

== Old Roman cursive ==

Old Roman [[cursive]], also called [[majuscule]] cursive and capitalis cursive, was the everyday form of handwriting used for writing letters, by merchants writing business accounts, by schoolchildren learning the [[Latin alphabet]], and even by [[Roman Emperor|emperors]] issuing commands. A more formal style of writing was based on [[Roman square capitals]], but cursive was used for quicker, informal writing. It was most commonly used from about the 1st century BC to the 3rd century AD, but it probably existed earlier than that. In the early 2nd century BC, the comedian [[Plautus]], in ''[[Pseudolus]]'', makes reference to the illegibility of cursive letters:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Calidorus: Take these letters, then tell yourself what misery and concern are wasting me away.&lt;br /&gt;
Pseudolus: I will do this for you. But what is this, I ask?&lt;br /&gt;
Calidorus: What's wrong?&lt;br /&gt;
Pseudolus: In my opinion, these letters are seeking children for themselves: one mounts the other.&lt;br /&gt;
Calidorus: Are you mocking me with your teasing?&lt;br /&gt;
Pseudolus: Indeed, by [[Castor and Pollux|Pollux]] I believe that unless the [[Sibyl]] can read these letters, nobody else can understand them.&lt;br /&gt;
Calidorus: Why do you speak harshly about these charming letters and charming tablets, written by a charming hand?&lt;br /&gt;
Pseudolus: By Hercules I beg you, do even hens have hands like these? For indeed a hen wrote these letters.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(Plautus, ''Pseudolus'', 21–30)

[[File:I littera in manuscripto.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Cursive handwriting from the reign of [[Claudius]] (41 to 54 AD):&lt;br&gt; ''vobis · vidétur · p · c · décernám[us · ut · etiam]&lt;br&gt;prólátis · rebus iis · iúdicibus · n[ecessitas · iudicandi]&lt;br&gt;imponátur qui · intrá rerum [· agendárum · dies]&lt;br&gt;incoháta · iudicia · non · per[egerint · nec]&lt;br&gt;defuturas · ignoro · fraudes · m[onstrósa · agentibus]&lt;br&gt;multas · adversus · quas · exc[ogitáuimus]...'']]

As the above extract shows, Old Roman cursive was considered difficult to read and roundly mocked even in its heyday, and is now considered almost illegible; the current cursive form of the Latin script has accordingly evolved beyond recognition. The script uses many [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], and some letters are unrecognizable – "a" looks like an uncial "a", but with the left stroke still straight, "b" and "d" are hard to distinguish, "e" is a full height letter (like the "s"), "p" and "t" are very similar, and "v" is written above the baseline, resembling an inverted [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford, [http://vindolanda.csad.ox.ac.uk/exhibition/paleo-1.shtml Scripts at Vindolanda] [http://vindolanda.csad.ox.ac.uk/exhibition/paleo-2.shtml page 2] [http://vindolanda.csad.ox.ac.uk/exhibition/paleo-3.shtml page 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Roman cursive ==

New Roman cursive, also called minuscule cursive or later Roman cursive, developed from old Roman cursive. It was used from approximately the 3rd century to the 7th century, and uses letter forms that are more recognizable to modern readers; "a", "b", "d", and "e" have taken a more familiar shape, and the other letters are proportionate to each other rather than varying wildly in size and placement on a line. These letter forms were in part the basis for the medieval script known as [[Carolingian minuscule]], which was developed at Aachen and in Tours in the 9th century and propagated throughout Charlemagne's empire in a deliberate attempt to unify handwriting, and whose revival in the [[Renaissance]], after it had evolved into the relatively illegible [[blackletter]] and fallen out of use, forms the basis of our modern lowercase letters. The [[uncial]] and [[half-uncial]] scripts also most likely developed from this script; "a", "g", "r", and "s" are particularly similar.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford, [http://vindolanda.csad.ox.ac.uk/exhibition/paleo-1.shtml Scripts at Vindolanda: Historical context].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jan-Olaf Tjäder]], new Roman cursive influenced the development of not only uncial, but of all the other scripts used in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Olaf Tjäder, (Lund, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford, [http://vindolanda.csad.ox.ac.uk/ Vindolanda Tablets]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaelic type]] is an example of a later usage of uncial.

'''Royasc''' is a [[dialect]] bridging the gap between the [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian language]] and the [[Occitan language]]. It is spoken in [[Italy]] and [[France]].

==Area of use==
[[Image:Map of Roiasc.svg|thumb|380px|Area of Royasc in France (blue) and Italy (orange and green)]]
The Royasc dialect is spoken in the Upper Roya valley, at the boundary of France and Italy.
In France, it is spoken in the communes of [[Breil-sur-Roya]], [[La Brigue]], [[Fontan]], [[Saorge]], [[Tende]] ([[Alpes Maritimes]]).
In Italy, it is spoken in the province of [[Imperia]], [[Liguria]] - communes of [[Olivetta San Michele]] and [[Triora]] (only in the villages of Realdo and Verdeggia) and in the province of [[Cuneo]], [[Piemont]] - communes of [[Briga Alta]] and the village of Viozene in the commune of [[Ormea]].

The dialect of La Brigue, Briga Alta, Realdo, Viozene, and Verdeggia is also named [[Brigasc]].

==History and position==
Royasc is the mountainous adaptation of the western [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian dialect]]. It received influence from the Occitan language as the Upper Roya valley was partly ruled by the County of Nice.

Its structure is Ligurian, but its position is discussed: some include it in the Ventimiglia dialect (intemelian)&lt;ref&gt;Werner Forner, "À propos du Ligurien Intémélien. La côte, l’arrière-pays", in ''Travaux du Cercle Linguistique de Nice'', 7-8 (1985-1986), pp. 29-61; Werner Forner, "Areallinguistik I: Ligurien", in ''Lexikon der Romanistischen Linguistik'' (LRL), IV, Tübingen 1988, pp. 453-469 ; Werner Forner, "Géographie linguistique et reconstruction, à l’exemple du ligurien intémélien", in ''Actes du I Colloque International sur l’ancien provençal, l’ancien français et l’ancien ligurien'', Nice sept. 1986 ("Bulletin du Centre de Romanistique et de Latinité Tardive"), Nice 1989, pp. 125-140&lt;/ref&gt; but others consider it a member of a very distinct group of Alpine Ligurian dialects, along with Pignasc and Triorasc.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Philippe DALBERA, "Le royasque: un ensemble dialectal aux confins de la langue d’oc et du ligurien", in Le site du Mont Bego de la protohistoire à nos jours.

'''Salvador Espriu i Castelló''' ({{IPA-ca|səlβəˈðo əsˈpɾiw}}; July 10, 1913 – February 22, 1985) was a Spanish poet who wrote most of his works in [[Catalan language|Catalan]].

==Biography==
Espriu was born in [[Santa Coloma de Farners]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. He was the son of an attorney.  He spent his childhood between his home town, [[Barcelona]], and [[Arenys de Mar]], a village on the [[Maresme]] coast. At the age of sixteen, he published his first book, ''Israel'', written in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. In 1930 he entered the [[University of Barcelona]], where he studied law and ancient history.  While traveling (1933) to [[Egypt]], [[Greece]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], he became acquainted with the countries that originated the great classical myths, and which would be so influential in his work.

During the [[Spanish civil war]] he was mobilised and served in military accounting.

Translated into several languages, Espriu's work has obtained international recognition, most notably the ''Montaigne prize'' (1971). He was also given the ''Award of Honour of Catalan Letters'' (1972), the ''Ignasi Iglesias prize'' (1980), the ''City of Barcelona Prize'' (1982) and the ''Gold Medal of the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]]'' (1982). He was awarded honorary doctor's degrees by the universities of [[University of Toulouse|Toulouse]] and [[University of Barcelona|Barcelona]].

He died in Barcelona in 1985, and was buried in the Arenys de Mar cemetery, which gives name to his poem ''Cementiri de Sinera''.

==Work==

===First works===
In 1931 he published ''El doctor Rip'', and the following year, ''Laia'', novels that move away from the then-fashionable theoretical formulas of the aesthetics of the Catalan [[Noucentisme]] movement.

The publication of ''Aspectes'' (1934), ''Ariadna al laberint grotesc''(1935) and ''Miratge a Citera'' (1935), established him as the most original narrator of his generation. In these books, Espriu's prose alternately shifts from grotesque distortion to an aestheticising lyricism, probably under the influence of Spanish-language modernists [[Valle-Inclán]] and [[Gabriel Miró]]). He elaborated a synthetic realism under the linguistic tutelage of certain Catalan writers, such as [[Víctor Català]] and [[Joaquím Ruyra]].

===The civil war===
In 1937, during the Civil War, he published ''Letizia i altres proses''. In 1939, in occupied Barcelona and before the military conflict ended, he wrote a play, ''Antígona'' (published in 1955 and opened in 1958), on the subject of fratricidal war and compassion for the losers.

===Poetry===
Espriu, who had begun to write poetry before the war, did not publish his first volume of poems until 1946: ''Cementiri de Sinera'', an elegy with a great formal sobriety. With this book and with the play ''Primera història d'Esther'' (published in 1948 and opened in 1957) —linguistically creative and original— began his post-war popularity, which grew as the rest of his work, essentially poetical, was published.

In ''Les cançons d'Ariadna'' (1949) he collected a series of poems from various periods that contrasted satire and distortion with elegy and lyricism and in which the mythological subjects can be found that were to appear in subsequent works.

The four books of poems that followed —''Les hores and Mrs. Death'' (1952), ''El caminant i el mur'' (1954) and ''Final del laberint'' (1955)—compose, together with ''Cementiri de Sinera'', a specific formal unity, on the one hand, given the symmetrical number of poems included in each volume and, on the other, the strict development of a very complex spiritual process that culminates in a mystical experience in the last book of the cycle. The musicality of Espriu's poetry has been stressed by [[Andreas Dorschel]].&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Dorschel, ''Lieder der Ariadne. Der große katalanische Lyriker Salvador Espriu.'' In: ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'', 15 October 2007. Aspects of Dorschel's text have been discussed by Ramon Farrés in ''Fritz Vogelgsang: Salvador Esprius Übersetzer ins Deutsche.'' In: ''Zeitschrift für Katalanistik'' 23 (2010), pp. 39–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular success===
The tremendous public success of ''La pell de brau'' (1960) signified the popular recognition of Espriu: the author posed the historical drama of ''Sepharad'' (poet's nickname for [[Spain]] after [[Sepharad|the Jewish usage]]) in poems with a high spiritual, moral and political resonance.

''Llibre de Sinera'' (1963), one of his most hermetic books, ties in with subjects from the two previous works and again circumscribes the civil ambit of his poetry to the "homeland" mythicized in ''Sinera'', a word phonetically formed by spelling backwards [[Arenys de Mar|Arenys]]. In ''Setmana Santa'' (1971), through the images of the ritual procession, the author presents the myth of the Catholic Passion from a metaphysical perspective.

The bibliography of Espriu contains two more poems, included in the first volume of his Complete works (1968) (''Per al llibre de salms d'aquests vells cecs'' and ''Fragments. Versots. Intencions. Matisos''), and a selection of critical works, ''Evocació de Rosselló-Pòrcel i altres notes'' (1957).

Beginning in 1968, with the publication of his Complete works I. Poetry, he dedicated himself to a minute revision of his entire work. In narrative, the novels ''El doctor Rip'' (1931) and ''Laia'' (1932) were practically re-written when they were again published (1979 and 1968, respectively). The same occurred with his collection of narrations ''Aspectes'' (1934) and ''Ariadna al laberint grotesc'' (1935), published again in 1981 and 1975, respectively.

The last examples of his production were, with respect to theatre, ''Una altra Fedra si us plau ...'' (1978), the prose volume ''Les roques i el mar, el blau'' (1981) and, in poetry, the poem ''D'una vella i encerclada terra'' (1979) and the collection ''Per a la bona gent'' (1984).

Several theatral stagings of this work were made by [[Ricard Salvat]], who also composed, based on texts by Espriu from various origins, ''Ronda de mort a Sinera'' (1966), a work with a broad theatrical audience.

The Valencian songwriter and singer [[Raimon]] has set to music Espriu's poems including ''Les cançons de la roda del temps'' (Songs on the Passing of Time), ''Inici de càntic en el temple'' (Beginning of the Canticle in the Temple) and ''Indesinenter''.

===A meditation on death===
The author generically described his work as a "meditation on death", but this term is too restrictive to comprehend its complexity and cultural point of view. Actually, Espriu proposes to assume the literary tradition of humanity in a personal re-creation situated in a specific geographical and historical context, [[Catalonia]] after the defeat of the Spanish Republic in the Spanish civil war, of which he sings its failings and hope.

Perhaps the most important virtue and originality of Espriu has been his capacity to reconcile, in the same unitary work, the spiritual problems of man, with metaphysical resonances, with his fate as a member of a group subjected to social and political tensions, while posing the great questions of justice and liberty.

===International Acclaim===

During his acceptance of the [[International Catalonia prize]], renowned literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] called Espriu 'an extraordinary poet by any  international standard', and later said 'The [[Nobel prize|Nobel]] committee is guilty of many errors,  and one of those was not to have given the prize to Salvador Espriu. I believe he deserved it'.

'''Semantic neural network''' (SNN) is based on [[John von Neumann]]'s neural network &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;von Neumann, 1966&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and [[Nikolai Amosov]] M-Network.&lt;ref&gt;Amosov, N. M., A. M. Kasatkin, and L. M. Kasatkina. "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/53cf/fb9917c98dcaf48be1ed5b7cb9c30c378a7a.pdf Active semantic networks in robots with independent control]." Proceedings of the 4th international joint conference on Artificial intelligence-Volume 1. Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amosov, N. M., E. M. Kussul, and A. M. Kasatkin. "29. NEURONLIKE NETWORKS, ATTENTION, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE." Neurocomputers and Attention: Connectionism and neurocomputers 2 (1991): 433.&lt;/ref&gt; There are limitations to a link topology for the von Neumann’s network but SNN accept a case without these limitations. Only [[Truth value|logical values]] can be processed, but SNN accept that fuzzy values can be processed too. All neurons into the von Neumann network are synchronized by tacts. For further use of self-synchronizing circuit technique SNN accepts neurons can be self-running or synchronized.

In contrast to the von Neumann network there are no limitations for topology of neurons for semantic networks. It leads to the impossibility of relative addressing of neurons as it was done by von Neumann. In this case an absolute readdressing should be used. Every neuron should have a unique identifier that would provide a direct access to another neuron. Of course, neurons interacting by axons-dendrites should have each other's identifiers. An absolute readdressing can be modulated by using neuron specificity as it was realized for biological neural networks.

There’s no description for self-reflectiveness and self-modification abilities into the initial description of semantic networks [Dudar Z.V., Shuklin D.E., 2000]. But in [Shuklin D.E. 2004] a conclusion had been drawn about the necessity of introspection and self-modification abilities in the system. For maintenance of these abilities a concept of pointer to neuron is provided. Pointers represent virtual connections between neurons. In this model, bodies and signals transferring through the neurons connections represent a physical body, and virtual connections between neurons are representing an astral body. It is proposed to create models of artificial neuron networks on the basis of virtual machine supporting the opportunity for paranormal effects.

SNN is generally used for natural language processing.

'''Slovincian''' is the language formerly spoken by the '''Slovincians''' ({{lang-csb|Słowińcë}}, {{lang-pl|Słowińcy}}, {{lang-de|Slowinzen, Lebakaschuben}}), a [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] tribe living between lakes [[Lake Gardno|Gardno]] and [[Lake Łebsko|Łebsko]] near [[Słupsk]] in [[Pomerania]].

Slovincian is classified either as a language (first by [[Friedrich Lorentz]], 1902/3&lt;ref name=Gilbers&gt;Dicky Gilbers, John A. Nerbonne, J. Schaeken, ''Languages in Contact'', Rodopi, 2000, p.329, {{ISBN|90-420-1322-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or as a [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]] dialect&lt;ref name=Bethin&gt;Christina Yurkiw Bethin, ''Slavic Prosody: Language Change and Phonological Theory'', pp.160ff, Cambridge University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-521-59148-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stankiewicz&gt;Edward Stankiewicz, ''The Accentual Patterns of the Slavic Languages'', Stanford University Press, 1993, p.291, {{ISBN|0-8047-2029-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hulst/&gt; (first by Lorentz, after 1903&lt;ref name=Gilbers/&gt;) or variant,&lt;ref name=Gilbers/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sussex&gt;Roland Sussex, Paul Cubberley, ''The Slavic Languages'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, p.97, {{ISBN|0-521-22315-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Kashubian itself being classified either as a language or as a [[Polish language|Polish]] dialect.&lt;ref name=Hulst&gt;Harry Hulst, Georg Bossong, ''Eurotyp'', Walter de Gruyter, 1999, p.837, {{ISBN|3-11-015750-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slovincian and Kashubian are both classified as [[Pomeranian language|Pomeranian]].&lt;ref name=Gilbers/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sussex/&gt;

Slovincian became extinct in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Gilbers/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sussex/&gt; However, individual words and expressions survived until after [[World War II]], when the region [[former eastern territories of Germany|became Polish]]. Some Slovincians were [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland after World War II|expelled along with the Germans]].&lt;ref name=Comrie762/&gt; Of those allowed to stay, a few elderly people had fragmentary knowledge of Slovincian until the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Comrie762/&gt;

It is disputed whether Slovincians actually used that name, given to them by the Russian academic [[Aleksander Hilferding]], for themselves. The synonym ''Lebakaschuben'' is also used. Some scholars believe that Slovincians regarded themselves merely as Lutheran [[Kashubians]] and their language as Kashubian. Nevertheless, the name "Slovincian" prevails in literature and is also used officially, for example in ''Słowiński Park Narodowy'' ([[Slovincian National Park]]), a protected area on the Polish Pomeranian coast.

==Phonology==

===Accent===
Slovincian is particularly important to Slavic accentologists because, together with the closely related northern Kashubian dialects, it is the only part of [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]] to retain the [[Proto-Slavic accent|free accent]] from [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]]. The accent was stress-based, free (''ˈkolo'',&lt;ref&gt;Using scholarly transcription according to Stankiewicz (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; ''vječˈeřa'', gen. pl. ''břegˈōv''). The length was distinctive (''ˈstrava'' "food" ≠ ''ˈtrāva'' "grass"). Stress can be enclinomenic&lt;ref&gt;See: {{cite web |last1=Carrasquer Vidal |first1=Miguel |title=Balto- Slavic accentology ‘for dummies’ |url= https://www.academia.edu/8855367/Balto-Slavic_Accentology_for_dummies |at=§ Slaaby-Larsen’s law |website=Academia.edu |publisher=Academia.edu |accessdate=5 November 2016 |date=October 2014 |quote=In Slavic, the barytone forms of mobile paradigms behave as if they were underlyingly unstressed. When a preverb or preposition precedes, the stress is retracted from the root to the prefix (ná vodǫ ‘on water’, né bylo ‘it was not’, etc.). Such forms are known as ''enclinomena''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mobile (''ˈvoda'' "water", ''ˈza vodą'' "for water", ''vodˈǭ'' "with water") or bound (''rˈiba'', ''za rˈibą'', ''rˈibǭ''). Beside accent, vowel length can also alternate within the paradigm (''mlˈocic'' "to trash, hit", 2nd. person present ''mlˈōcīš''). The syllable is always long before a voiced final consonant (''břēg'' "hill", but ''ˈbřegū'').

The small number of [[oxytone]]s has been considered both an archaism and an innovation,&lt;ref name=Bethin/&gt; while the quantity distinction by stress is a conservative feature shared with [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]].&lt;ref name=Stankiewicz/&gt; There are two accentual paradigms in Slovincian, a fixed and a mobile one, with the mobile one resulting in a stress alternation only within the stem, not the ending.&lt;ref name=Bethin/&gt;

==Grammar==
{{expand section|date=October 2013}}
Slovincian grammar is preserved in the "''Slovinzische Grammatik''" compiled in 1903 by [[Friedrich Lorentz]], who in 1908-1912 also published "''Slovinzisches Wörterbuch''", a Slovincian dictionary.&lt;ref name=Stankiewicz/&gt;

== History ==

The ancestors of the Slovincians, the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Pomeranians]], moved in after the [[Migration Period]]. Following the [[Ostsiedlung]], the Slovincians like most of the other [[Wends]] gradually became Germanized. The [[Protestant Reformation|adoption of Lutheranism]] in the [[Duchy of Pomerania]] in 1534&lt;ref name="Buchholz pp.205-220"&gt;Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp.205-212, {{ISBN|3-88680-272-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard du Moulin Eckart, ''Geschichte der deutschen Universitäten'', Georg Olms Verlag, 1976, pp.111,112, {{ISBN|3-487-06078-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Realenzyklopädie, p.43ff"&gt;Gerhard Krause, Horst Robert Balz, Gerhard Müller, ''Theologische Realenzyklopädie'', Walter de Gruyter, 1997, pp.43ff, {{ISBN|3-11-015435-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished the Slovincians from the [[Kashubes]] in [[Pomerelia]], who remained [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name=Comrie762&gt;Bernard Comrie, Greville G. Corbett, ''The Slavonic languages'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 2002, p.762, {{ISBN|0-415-28078-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, "''Slovincian''" was also applied to the Slavic speakers in the [[Bytów]] (Bütow) region further south.&lt;ref name=Comrie762/&gt;

In the 16th and 17th century [[Michael Brüggemann]] (also known as Pontanus or Michał Mostnik), Simon Krofey (Szimon Krofej) and J.M. Sporgius introduced Kashubian into the Lutheran Church. Krofey, [[pastor]] in [[Bytów]] (Bütow), published a religious song book in 1586, written in Polish but also containing some Kashubian words. Brüggemann, pastor in [[Schmolsin]], published a Polish translation of some works of [[Martin Luther]] and biblical texts, also containing Kashubian elements. Other biblical texts were published in 1700 by Sporgius, pastor in Schmolsin. His "''Schmolsiner Perikopen''", most of which is written in the same Polish-Kashubian style of Krofey's and Brüggemann's books, also contain small passages ("6th Sunday after Epiphanias") written in pure Kashubian.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hauptmann, Günther Schulz, Kirche im Osten: Studien zur osteuropäischen Kirchengeschichte und Kirchenkunde, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2000, pp.44ff, {{ISBN|3-525-56393-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=qHL3-GAJE-YC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=slowinzen&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA44,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilferding (1862) and [[Parczewski]] (1896) confirmed a progressive language shift in the Kashubian population from their Slavonic vernacular to the local German dialect ([[Low German]] [[Ostpommersch]] or [[High German]], in eastern Kashubian areas also Low German [[Low Prussian]]).&lt;ref name=Gilbers/&gt;

By the 1920s, the Slovincian villages had become linguistically German, though a Slovincian consciousness remained.&lt;ref name=Comrie762/&gt; The area remained within the borders of Germany until becoming part of Poland after World War II ended in 1945 and [[History of Pomerania (1945-present)|the area became Polish]]. Some Slovincians were [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|expelled along with the German population]], some were allowed to remain.&lt;ref name=Comrie762/&gt; In the 1950s, mainly in the village of [[Kluki, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Kluki]] (formerly Klucken), a few elderly people still remembered fragments of Slovincian.&lt;ref name=Comrie762/&gt;

Slovincians began to ask for the right to emigrate to West Germany, and virtually all of the remaining Slovincian families had emigrated there by the 1980s, if they had not already been [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]] there by the Polish authorities between 1945 and 1950.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14558">'''Talibanization''' (or '''Talibanisation''') is a term coined following the rise of the [[Taliban]] movement in [[Afghanistan]] referring to the process where other religious groups or movements come to follow or imitate the strict practices of the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;''The Fundamentalist City?: Religiosity and the Remaking of Urban Space'' by Nezar Alsayyad. p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Talibanization of Southeast Asia: losing the war on terror to Islamist extremists''. Bilveer Singh. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In its original usage, Talibanization referred to groups who followed Taliban practices such as:
*usually strict regulation of women, including forbidding of most employment or schooling for women;
*the banning of long lists of activities generally tolerated by other Muslims—movies, television, videos, music, dancing, hanging pictures in homes, clapping during sports events;
*the banning of activities (especially hairstyles and clothing) generally tolerated by other Muslims on the grounds that the activities are Western;
*oppression of [[Shia]], including [[takfir]] threats that they convert to [[Sunni]] Islam or be prepared to be killed;
*aggressive enforcement of its regulations, particularly the use of armed "[[Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Afghanistan)|religious police]]";
*the destruction of non-Muslim artifacts, especially carvings and statues such as [[Buddhas of Bamyan]], generally tolerated by other Muslims, on the grounds that the artifacts are [[Idolatry|idolatrous]] or [[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]];
*harboring of [[Al Qaeda]] or other extremists;
*a discriminatory attitude towards non-Muslims such as [[sumptuary laws]] against [[Hinduism in Afghanistan|Afghan Hindus]], requiring them to wear [[yellow badge]]s, a practice reminiscent of [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[anti-Semitic]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/fyi/news/05/22/taleban.hindus/index.html Taliban to mark Afghan Hindus],''CNN''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/english/200105/23/eng20010523_70812.html Taliban: Hindus Must Wear Identity Labels],''People's Daily''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cns"&gt;[http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPrint.asp?Page=%5CForeignBureaus%5Carchive%5C200106%5CFor20010615b.html US Lawmakers Condemn Taliban Treatment Of Hindus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525201233/http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPrint.asp?Page=%5CForeignBureaus%5Carchive%5C200106%5CFor20010615b.html |date=2008-05-25 }},''CNSnews.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The term pre-dates the [[Islamic terrorist]] attacks of [[9/11]].  It was first used to describe areas or groups outside of Afghanistan which came under the influence of the Taliban, such as the areas of [[Waziristan]] in [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref name=BORDER-BACKLASH&gt;{{cite news

==In the Gaza Strip==
{{further|Islamization of the Gaza Strip}}
Following the takeover of the Gaza Strip in June 2007, Hamas has attempted to implement Islamic law in the Gaza Strip, mainly at schools, institutions and courts by imposing the Islamic dress or [[hijab]] on women.&lt;ref name="xinhua"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2010-01/03/content_12748559.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514030330/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2010-01/03/content_12748559.htm |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }} Xinhua, 2010-01-03&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Ismael Haniyeh]] officially denied that Hamas intended to establish an Islamic emirate,&lt;ref name="Schanzer"/&gt; in the two years since the 2007 coup, the Gaza Strip has exhibited the characteristics of Talibanization,&lt;ref name="Schanzer"/&gt; whereby the Islamist organization imposed strict rules on women, discouraged activities commonly associated with Western or Christian culture, oppressed non-Muslim minorities, imposed [[sharia]] law, and deployed religious police to enforce these laws.&lt;ref name="Schanzer"&gt;[http://www.currenttrends.org/research/detail/the-talibanization-of-gaza-a-liability-for-the-muslim-brotherhood The Talibanization of Gaza: A Liability for the Muslim Brotherhood] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929201200/http://www.currenttrends.org/research/detail/the-talibanization-of-gaza-a-liability-for-the-muslim-brotherhood |date=2010-09-29 }}. by Jonathan Schanzer. August 19, 2009. [[Current Trends in Islamist Ideology]] vol. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] researcher Dr. [[Khaled Al-Hroub]] has criticized what he called the "Taliban-like steps" Hamas has taken. In an article titled "The Hamas Enterprise and the Talibanization of Gaza", he wrote, "The Islamization that has been forced upon the Gaza Strip – the suppression of social, cultural, and press freedoms that do not suit Hamas's view[s] – is an egregious deed that must be opposed. It is the reenactment, under a religious guise, of the experience of [other] totalitarian regimes and dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hamas Enterprise and the Talibanization of Gaza'', by Khaled Al-Hroub, Al-Ayyam (Palestinian Authority), October 11, 2010. [http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4696.htm Translation] by the Middle East Research Institute, October 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 research by Eli Berman of [[UC San Diego]] and the  [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] drew a number of parallels between Hamas and Taliban. Researchers noted that Taliban and Hamas are both highly ritualistic, extremely conservative Muslim groups, which augment the prohibitions of mainstream Islamic practice, and tend to segregate themselves from other Muslims and to be intolerant of deviation.&lt;ref name="berman"&gt;[http://econ.ucsd.edu/~elib/tamir.pdf Hamas, Taliban and the Jewish Underground: AN ECONOMIST’S VIEW OF RADICAL RELIGIOUS MILITIAS]. [[Eli Berman]], UC San Diego, and National Bureau of Economic Research. August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reference to non-Muslims==
The term is also used non-literally, and is applied to non-Islamic bodies and organizations by those who allege them to hold "repressive policies" based on their respective religions.

In addition, some members of the [[left-wing|left]] in the United States may use it as a criticism of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Christian Right]] in their allegations of the radical right wing implementing policies based on [[Fundamentalist Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Blaker, Kimberly, ''The Fundamentals of Extremism: The Christian Right in America'', New Boston, Mich, 2003, {{ISBN|0-9725496-1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like any highly politicized term, it may also be used hyperbolically or in an alarmist manner, to make a [[slippery slope]] argument, such as in the invocation of the phrase "Talibanization of [[Bradford]]" to discuss a gamut of common racial problems and tensions which fall far short of the imposition of sharia law and terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name=BEHEADING-NATIONS-THE-ISLAMIZATION-OF-EUROPES-CITIES&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4941">'''Temporal annotation''' is the study of how to automatically add semantic information regarding [[time]] to [[natural language]] documents. It plays a role in [[natural language processing]] and [[computational linguistics]].

==About==
Temporal annotation involves the application of a semantic annotation to a document. Significant temporal annotation standards include [[TimeML]], [[ISO-TimeML]] and [[TIDES]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferro|first=L|title=TIDES 2005 standard for the annotation of temporal expressions|journal=MITRE Corporation Technical Report|year=2005|url=https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/sites/www.ldc.upenn.edu/files/english-timex2-guidelines-v0.1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standards typically include annotations for some or all of temporal expressions (or ''timexes''), events, temporal relations, temporal signals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Derczynski|first=L|title=A corpus-based study of temporal signals|journal=Proceedings of the Corpus Linguistics Conference|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and temporal relation types.

In natural language texts, events may be associated with times; e.g., they may start or end at a given at a time. Events are also associated with other events, like occurring before or after them. We call these relations temporal relations. Temporal relation typing classifies the relation between two arguments, and is an important and difficult sub-task of figuring out all the temporal information in a document. [[Allen's interval algebra]] is one scheme for types of temporal relations. Rule-engineering and [[machine learning]] approaches to temporal annotation have both been successful, though achieving high performance in temporal relation typing remains a difficult task.

==Applications==
Successful temporal annotation enables systems to find out when facts asserted in texts are true, to build timelines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ji|first=Heng|title=Tackling Representation, Annotation and Classification Challenges for Temporal Knowledge Base Population|journal=Journal of Knowledge and Information Systems|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to extract plans, and to discover mentions of change. This has had applications in many domains, such as [[information extraction]], [[digital history]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cybulska|first=A|title=Historical event extraction from text|journal=Proceedings of the 5th ACL-HLT Workshop on Language Technology for Cultural Heritage, Social Sciences, and Humanities|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; processing [[social media]], and [[electronic health record|clinical]] [[text mining]].

==Evaluation==
The TempEval task series sets a shared temporal annotation task, and has run at [[SemEval]] three times, attracting system entries from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verhagen|first=Marc|title=Semeval-2007 task 15: Tempeval temporal relation identification|journal=Proceedings of the Workshop on Semantic Evaluation|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verhagen|first=Marc|title=Semeval-2010 task 13: Tempeval-2|journal=Proceedings of the Workshop on Semantic Evaluation|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UzZaman|first=N|title=Semeval-2013 task 1: Tempeval-3|journal=Proceedings of the Workshop on Semantic Evaluation|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task originally centred on determining the types of temporal relations only. In TempEval-2 and -3, this expanded to include event and timex annotation. In addition, the [[i2b2]] clinical evaluation shared task was a temporal annotation exercise in 2012, which attracted a great deal of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sun|first=W|title=Evaluating temporal relations in clinical text: 2012 i2b2 Challenge|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|year=2013|doi=10.1136/amiajnl-2013-001628 |pmc=3756273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''world championship''' is generally an [[international]] [[sport]]s competition open to elite competitors from around the world, representing their nations, and winning such an event will be considered the highest or near highest achievement in the sport or contest.

==Overview==
The title is usually awarded through a combination of specific contests or, less commonly, [[ranking]] systems (e.g. the [[ICC Test Championship]]), or a combination of the two (e.g. [[World Triathlon Championships]] in [[Triathlon]]). This determines a 'world champion', who or which is commonly considered the best nation, team, individual (or other entity) in the world in a particular field, although the vagaries of sport ensure that the competitor recognised at the best in an event is not always the 'world champion' (see [[Underdog (term)|Underdog]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Certain sports do not have a world championship. Instead, they may organise a [[world cup competition]], or they may organize both, for example cycling ([[UCI World Championships]] and [[UCI World Cups]])). Often, the use of the term cup or championship in this sense is just a choice of words. Some sports have multiple champions because of multiple organizations, such as boxing, mixed martial arts and wrestling.

Certain sports do not have a world championship or a world cup as such, but may have one or several world champions. Professional [[boxing]], for example, has several world champions at [[Boxing weight classes|different weights]], but each one of them is decided by a "title fight", not a tournament.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A certain number of sports hold world championships or world cups which are overshadowed, in terms of prestige, by the same events in the [[Olympic Games]], the most prestigious multi-sports event.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Still other sports may or may not have a true world championship but may designate the winners of a domestic competition to be "world champions." This is especially true of the [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]]; world cups and championships exist in all of the major sports, but the domestic U.S. and Canadian leagues are generally nicknamed as the world ''[[professional sports|professional]]'' championships or the equivalent of a world ''club'' championship. (In [[American football]], although an [[IFAF World Championship]] exists, the United States is so far above and beyond the other nations it faces that the winner of the U.S.-based [[Super Bowl]], a competition limited to the 32 teams in the [[National Football League]], is commonly nicknamed as the world champion by the players, the press and fans alike; the NFL itself explicitly marketed the contest as a world championship in its first iterations.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Evans |first=Simon |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/03/us-nfl-superbowl-world-idUSTRE71295820110203 |title=Super Bowl contenders happy with world champions title |agency=Reuters |date= February 3, 2011|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, certain professional sports do not have a world championship or world cup, but rather hold a series of events recognised as the elite level in their field (e.g. [[tennis]] has a series of four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] events recognised as the pinnacle of the game, in addition to key team events, world tour finals and the Olympic Games, though each year [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] designates a [[ITF World Champions|World Champion]] based on performances throughout the year).

This table includes medals for both individual and team events. "Best" in this list is considered to be the sportsperson who is on top of their sport's [[medal table]], rather than sportsperson with most overall medals. Currently active competitors are highlighted in pale green. ''Italics'' indicates more than one title achieved in a single year.
