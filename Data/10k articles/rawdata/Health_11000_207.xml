'''Alternative formats''' include [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]], [[braille]], [[E-text|electronic]] or [[large print]] versions of standard print such as educational material, textbooks, information leaflets, and even people's personal bills and letters. Alternative formats are created to help people who are blind or visual impaired to gain assess to their personal and leisure information either by sight (large print), by ear (audio) or by touch (braille).

== Audio ==
Audio information is beneficial for many people and can be used by anyone who owns a CD player, a [[DAISY Digital Talking Book|DAISY player]] or a computer. Audio enables people who are blind or visual impaired to access information through hearing, in the sense that print readers would understand it. 

=== Choosing audio ===
Different people are likely to have their own preferences about the way they access audio, depending on their experiences, how comfortable are they with technology, and the equipment they to access the audio content.

=== CD as a medium for accessing information ===
[[File:Interference-colors.jpg|thumb|Interference-colors]]
[[Compact Discs]] (CDs) were first produced  in the 1980s to store and playback sound recordings exclusively, and became superior to [[cassette tapes]] (AC) offering better sound and size. Standard CDs have a diameter of 120 millimetres (4.7 in) and can hold up to 80 minutes of uncompressed audio (or 700 Megabytes of data). CDs offer some navigation from the beginning of one track to another, rather than having to fast forward or rewind and guess where the tracks started and finished.[[File:Cassette-tape 8192.jpg|thumb|Cassette-tape 8192]]

Over time, CDs have progressed from being solely for music, to being a format for all kinds of data storage, such as text, images, photos and videos. Educators can use CDs to store educational materials including taped lectures, presentations, and handouts into one compact disc for the student to access on CD players or computers.

== Braille ==
Braille is a tactile system of raised dots that enables people who are visual impaired or blind to access information by touch. The pattern of raised dots is arranged in cells of up to six dots, creating a total of 63 different combinations possible. Each cell represents an alphabet letter, numeral or punctuation mark. Some frequently used words and letter combinations also have their own single cell patterns.

[[File:A person reading a braille book.jpg|thumb|A person reading a braille book]]
Braille can be the building block for language skills and a way to teach spelling, grammar, and punctuations to people with vision loss or who are deaf-blind. Not only do Braille codes represent alphabets, they also denote numbers, symbols, music and mathematical notations, enabling people to learn about different subjects in a different way from most of us. Braille books are available in all subject areas, ranging from modern fiction to mathematics, music and law. As with printed text, Braille makes it possible for people to access information in this format.

== Electronic (e-text) ==
For many of us, having access to computer equipment and appropriate software makes written information accessible. Today’s technology allows people to do majority of their research online, share documents via email, and download lecture notes from school websites. With written text converted into a format that is readable on the computer, it can be accessed visually with screen magnification software, or through auditory means with text-to-speech technology.

== Large print ==
Large print is essential for people who have visual or learning difficulties and have trouble reading fine print or deciphering crowded text at one time. Large print usually ranges from 16 to 22 point, while giant print uses fonts that are bigger than 24 point.

Having one single size will not meet everyone’s needs; therefore, it is important to find out which is a comfortable reading size for each individual. Research has demonstrated the positive impacts of providing enlarged font size for people with mild to moderate visual impairments, resulting in an increased reading fluency and speed.

[[File:HeavenlyBundlePouch.jpg|thumb|William Sears advises mothers to carry their baby on the body as often as possible.]]
'''Attachment parenting''' ('''AP''') is a [[parenting]] philosophy that proposes methods which aim to promote the [[attachment theory|attachment of parent and infant]] not only by maximal parental [[empathy]] and responsiveness but also by continuous bodily closeness and touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=2f, 5, 8–10, 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''attachment parenting'' was coined by the American [[pediatrics|pediatrician]] [[William Sears (physician)|William Sears]].

In [[Sociology of the family|family sociology]], attachment parenting is considered to be the most striking manifestation of ''[[Sociology of the family#Intensive mothering and the motherhood mandate|intensive mothering]]'' or ''[[Parental portrayals in the media#New momism|New momism]]''. The doctrine has hence been targeted by criticism from a host of objectors.&lt;ref&gt;See section [[#Controversy|Controversy]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Context ===
Attachment parenting is only one of many responsiveness and love-oriented parenting philosophies that entered the pedagogical mainstream after [[World War II]], and it owes many of its ideas to older teachings, such as [[Benjamin Spock]]'s influential handbook ''[[The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care|Baby and Child Care]]'' (1946). Spock had mothers advised to raise their infants according to their own [[common sense]] and with plenty of physical contact – a guideline that radically broke with the preceding doctrines of [[Luther Emmett Holt|L. Emmett Holt]] and [[John B. Watson]]; the book became a bestseller, and Spock's new child rearing concept greatly influenced the upbringing of the post-war generations.

Thirty years later, [[Jean Liedloff]] caused a stir by a "[[continuum concept]]" that she presented to the public in a book of the same title (1975). In [[Venezuela]], Liedhoff had studied [[Ye'kuana people]], and later she recommended to Western mothers to nurse and to wear their infants and to share their bed with them. She argued that infants, speaking in terms of [[evolution]], have not arrived in the [[modernity]] yet, so that today's way of child care – with bottle feeding, use of cribs and baby carriages, etc. – does not meet their needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.continuum-concept.org/cc_defined.html |title=Understanding The Continuum Concept | access-date=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, authors such as Sharon Heller and [[Meredith Small]] contributed further [[ethnopediatrics|ethnopediatric]] insights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Small |first=Meredith F. |title=Our Babies, Ourselves. How Biology and Culture Shape the Way We Parent |location=New York |publisher=Anchor Books |year=1999 }}; {{cite book |last=Heller |first=Sharon |title=The vital touch : how intimate contact with your baby leads to happier, healthier development | location=New York, NY | publisher=Henry Holt | year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] [[Aletha Solter]] published her book ''The Aware Baby'' about a parenting philosophy that advocates attachment, extended breastfeeding and abstinence from punishment, similarly to what William Sears later wrote; however, the point that Solter stressed most was an encouragement of the child's emotional expression in order to heal [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] and [[Psychological trauma|trauma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Solter |first=Aletha Jauch|title=The Aware Baby |location=Goleta, CA |publisher=Shining Star Press |year=1984 |isbn=  }}; {{cite web | url=http://www.awareparenting.com |title=Aware Parenting Institute |access-date=2016-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[T. Berry Brazelton]] invigorated  the discussion. He contributed new research about the capacity of even newborn infants to express themselves and their emotions, sensitized parents for these signals, and encouraged them – just like Spock – to follow their own judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/01/t-berry-brazelton-memoir/2113683/ |title=At 95, Brazelton shares 'A Life Caring for Children' |access-date=2015-01-16|newspaper=USA Today|date=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin ===
William Sears came to the term "attachment parenting" in 1982 by reading Liedloff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative parenting : how to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth through adolescence |location=New York |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |year=1983 |edition=pocket book |orig-year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he referred to his new philosophy as "the new continuum concept" and "immersion mothering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |edition=pocket book |pages=87, 164, 166, 174, 176, 181ff, 184, 238f}}; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he published his book ''Creative Parenting'' in 1982, the concept was largely elaborate already. The "7 Baby-Bs" were not explicitly presented as a [[Canon (basic principle)|canon]] yet, but as basic elements of a new parenting philosophy they were distinctly clear even at that early point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |edition=pocket book}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, William Sears and his wife Martha Sears began to link the concept – [[ex post]] – with [[attachment theory]] which they had begun to recognize at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Only since 1987 Sears' writings explicitly refer to [[John Bowlby]]'s and [[Mary Ainsworth]]'s writings. {{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Growing together: A parent's guide to baby's first year |location=Franklin Park, IL |publisher=La Leche League International |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, they used the term "attachment parenting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Christian Parenting and Child Care |publisher= T. Nelson |location=Nashville |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ Quotation | [...] I realized we needed to change the term to something more positive, so we came up with AP, since the Attachment Theory literature was so well researched and documented, by John Bowlby and others. | Martha Sears&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://attachedattheheart.attachmentparenting.org/faq/ |title=How did attachment parenting originate? |access-date=2016-01-20 }}; {{cite book |last1=Nicholson |first1=Barbara |last2=Parker |first2=Lysa |title=Attached at the Heart.

}}

In 1993, William Sears and Martha Sears published ''The Baby Book'' which became the first comprehensive manual for AP-parents and which was occasionally dubbed "the attachment parenting bible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=William |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The baby book : everything you need to know about your baby : from birth to age two |location=Boston |publisher=Little, Brown |year=1993 }} {{cite web |url=http://www.allparenting.com/my-life/articles/971001/what-attachment-parenting-really-means |title=What attachment parenting really means |access-date=2016-03-15 }}; {{cite web |url=http://www.healthfamilydeals.com/children/babies-pooping-over-garbage-cans-and-hypnotized-toddlers-a-guide-to-progressive-parenting.html |title=Babies Pooping Over Garbage Cans and Hypnotized Toddlers: A Guide to Progressive Parenting |access-date=2016-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325155332/http://www.healthfamilydeals.com/children/babies-pooping-over-garbage-cans-and-hypnotized-toddlers-a-guide-to-progressive-parenting.html |archive-date=2016-03-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first attachment parenting organization, ''Attachment Parenting International'', formed in 1994 in [[Alpharetta, Georgia]] and was founded by Lysa Parker and Barbara Nicholson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.attachmentparenting.ca/articles/APAttachmentparenting101.pdf |last=Arnall |first=Judy |title=Attachment Parenting 101 |access-date=2016-03-09 }}; {{cite web | url=http://attachedattheheart.attachmentparenting.org/about-the-authors/ |title=Barbara Nicholson, Lysa Parker |access-date=2016-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book that carried the term ''attachment parenting'' in the title was written by Tammy Frissell-Deppe, a mother who gave an account of her personal experiences and of those of her friends and acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frissell-Deppe |first=Tammy |title=Every Parent's Guide to Attachment Parenting: Getting back to basic instincts! |location=Dracut, MA |publisher=J.E.D. Publishing |year=1998 |isbn=0-9666341-4-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, blogger Katie Allison Granju followed with another book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Granju |first1=Katie Allison |last2=Kennedy |first2=Betsy |title=Attachment Parenting: Instinctive Care for Your Baby and Young Child |location= |publisher=Pocket Books |year=1999 |isbn=0-671-02762-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; to which William Sears contributed a [[foreword]], before he, together with Martha Sears, published his own work, ''The Attachment Parenting Book'' in 2001. All three books stood – with their opposition against a crude behavioristic infant anthropology – in the tradition of Spock, but radicalized the concept of a contingency-oriented parenting on the one hand, and incorporated Liedloff's idea of an instinct-guided resp. "[[Nature|natural]]" childrearing on the other hand.

In the same year as Sears and Sears' ''Attachment Parenting Book'', [[Jan Hunt]] published her essay collection ''The Natural Child. Parenting from the Heart''. Hunt who sees herself as a [[Child advocacy|child advocate]], campaigned in this book not only for attachment parenting, but also for [[unschooling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalchild.org/ |title=The Natural Child Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent AP proponent is parenting advisor Naomi Aldort, who published her book ''Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aldort |first=Naomi |title=Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves: Transforming parent-child relationships from reaction and struggle to freedom, power and joy |location=Borthell, WA |publisher=Book Publishers Network |isbn=978-1887542326 |year=2006  }} {{cite web |url=http://www.naomialdort.com |title=Naomi Aldort's web site |access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice==

=== Babyreading ===
Like before him the founders of [[attachment theory]], [[Mary Ainsworth]] in particular, William Sears teaches that a strong mother-child-attachment emerges from contingency, that is of emotional attunement of mother and child, which again is based on the mother's [[Sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]]. Since the mother "reads" the signals of her infant, Sears speaks in this context of "babyreading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=5–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another metaphor that he uses is "to be in the groove".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Sears strongly believes in the existence of child rearing practices that support "babyreading" and that augment the maternal sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=5, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methods of attachment parenting include seven practices resp. principles that according to Sears form a "synergetic" ensemble and that are based on the child's "biological needs".&lt;ref name="Little, Brown and Company"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sears refers to those principles as "7 Baby Bs":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=5f, 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1999, Sears named only five Baby Bs. The last two were only added in 2001 with the publication of the ''Attachment Parenting Book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Granju |first1=Katie Allison |last2=Kennedy |first2=Betsy |title=Attachment Parenting: Instinctive Care for Your Baby and Young Child |location=New York, NY |publisher=Pocket Books |year=1999 |isbn=0-671-02762-X |pages=xix }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Birth bonding ====
[[File:Postpartum baby2.jpg|thumb|Mother with newborn]]
William Sears postulates the existence of a brief time slot immediately after birth during which the newborn is in a "quiet alert state" and particularly accessible for [[Human bonding|bonding]]. He refers to this birth bonding as "[[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]]" and bases himself on a study by Marshall Klaus and John Kennell from 1967; however, Klaus and Kennell later modified their original assumptions, including the one cited by Sears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |pages=47ff, 52, 54, 183}}; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=36–47 }}; {{cite book |last1=Klaus |first1=Marshall H. |last2=Kennell |first2=John H. |title=Maternal-Infant Bonding: The Impact of Early Separation or Loss on Family Development |location=St. Louis |publisher=C.V.

==== Breastfeeding ====
William Sears argues that [[breastfeeding]] greatly accommodates mother-child-attachment because it triggers the release of [[oxytocin]] in the mother which supports her emotional bonding with the child, notably in the first ten days after childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |p=96, 188 }}; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=53–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to bottle feeding which tends to being done in 3 to 4 hour intervals, breastfeeding enables the mother, too, to perceive the child's moods and needs exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=56–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[half-life]] period of the hormones [[prolactin]] and oxytocin (which promote bonding) are very short, Sears recommends to breastfeed very frequently, newborns in particular (8 to 12 times a day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=55f, 60, 120f }}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that the hours between 1 and 6 am are the most beneficial for breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Sears argues that breastfeeding is beneficial for the health of both child and mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=54f }}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that infants up to 6 months should be exclusively fed with [[breast milk]], since he believes that, at that age, children are [[Food allergy|allergic]] to all other foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

William and Martha Sears advise mothers to breastfeed every child for 1–4 years:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |p=120 }}; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=64 }}; {{cite book |last1=Granju |first1=Katie Allison |last2=Kennedy |first2=Betsy |title=Attachment Parenting: Instinctive Care for Your Baby and Young Child |location=New York, NY |publisher=Pocket Books |year=1999 |isbn=0-671-02762-X |pages=290ff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

William Sears advocates extended breastfeeding, since he is convinced that breastfeeding supports attachment even of older children and that it is a valid instrument to comfort older children or to bring mother and child together on turbulent days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=62f }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither does he object nighttime breastfeeding of toddlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=99 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as in 1992, Norma Jane Bumgarner had campaigned for extended breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bumgarner |first=Norma Jane |title=Mothering your nursing toddler |location=Franklin Park, Illinois |publisher=La Leche League International |year=1992 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sears’ recommendations are in accordance with the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] guidelines on breastfeeding, which recommend exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months and complementary breastfeeding in the first 2 years for all countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/breastfeeding/en/ |title=WHO: Breastfeeding |access-date=2016-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since breastfeeding studies are, for ethical reasons, never conducted as [[randomized controlled trial]]s, critics have repeatedly suspected that studies may have produced the superiority of breastfeeding as an [[artifact (error)|artifact]]. Both the physical, emotional and mental development of children and the preferences of women for a feeding method are strongly determined by [[socioeconomics|socioeconomical]] factors such as the mother's [[ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[social class]], and [[education]]. If researchers go without [[randomization]] and turn a blind eye to those possible alternative factors, they fundamentally run a risk to falsely credit the feeding method for effects of socioeconomical factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/are-the-benefits-of-breastfeeding-oversold/ |title=Are the benefits of breastfeeding oversold? |access-date=2015-02-15 }}; {{cite web | url=http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/content/32/4/595.full.pdf+html |title=Is Breast Really Best? Risk and Total Motherhood in the National Breastfeeding Awareness Campaign |access-date=2015-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A loophole from this problem was first presented by Cynthia G. Colen ([[Ohio State University]]), who successfully factored out socioeconomical determinants by comparing siblings only; her study demonstrated that formula fed children showed only minimal differences to their breastfed siblings, insofar as their physical, emotional and mental thriving was concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Colen |first1=Cynthia G. |last2=Ramey |first2=David M. |title=Is breast truly best?

William Sears' assumptions about the benefit of breastfeeding for the attachment have been studied. In 2006, John R. Britton and a research team ([[Kaiser Permanente]]) found that highly sensitive mothers are more likely than less sensitive mothers to breastfeed and to breastfeed over a long time period. However, the study showed no effect of the feeding method on the attachment quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Britton |first1=John R. |last2=Britton |first2=Helen L. |last3=Gronwaldt |first3=Virginia |title=Breastfeeding, Sensitivity, and Attachment |journal=Pediatrics |volume=118 |issue=5 |year=November 2006 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/118/5/e1436?sso=1&amp;sso_redirect_count=1&amp;nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3a+No+local+token }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Babywearing ====
[[File:Position reclining cradle.jpg|thumb|A child in a sling]]
Sears advises mothers to wear infants on the body as many hours during the day as possible, for example in a [[baby sling|sling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=65 }}; {{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |p=78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that this practice makes the child happy and allows the mother to involve the child into everything she does and never to lose sight of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=65, 67f, 70–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He advises working mothers to wear the child at least 4–5 hours every night in order to make good for her absence during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=133, 139f }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, a research team from New York revealed in a randomized study that children of lower class mothers who to the age of 13 months spent a lot of time in a child carrier on their mother's body showed significantly more frequently a secure attachment as defined by Ainsworth than the control group children, who spend more time in an infant seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anisfeld |first=E. |last2=Casper |first2=V. |last3=Nozyce |first3=M. |last4=Cunningham |first4=N. |title=Does infant carrying promote attachment? An experimental study of the effects of increased physical contact on the development of attachment | journal=Child Development |year=1990 |volume=61 |issue= 5|pages=1617–1627 |pmid=2245751 |doi=10.2307/1130769}}&lt;/ref&gt; For middle-class families, an equivalent study doesn't exist yet.

Sears argues furthermore that babywearing exercises the child's [[Equilibrioception|sense of balance]]; since a child who is worn on the mother's experiences more of her conversations, he believes that babywearing is also beneficial for the child's [[language acquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=71f }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are not studies that confirm such effects.

It is undisputed that babywearing can calm children down. Infants cry the most in the age of 6 weeks; in 1986, a research team at [[McGill University]] showed in a randomized study that infants of that age cried significantly less if their parents wore them a lot on the body during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hunziker |first1=U.A. |last2=Barr |first2=R.G. |title=Increased carrying reduces infant crying: a randomized controlled trial | journal=Pediatrics |volume= 77|issue=5 |year=May 1986 |pages=641–648 |pmid=3517799 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sears recommends babywearing for the purpose of settling a baby to sleep, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He approves on the use of a sling up to the age of 3, since childwearing can also be used to calm a misbehaving toddler down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other pediatricians find it disputable to wear children beyond the age of 9 months permanently on the body, arguing that this is against the child's natural desire for autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://diepresse.com/home/bildung/erziehung/759158/Die-fix-gebundenen-Kinder |title=Die fix gebundenen Kinder |access-date=2015-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Co-Sleeping ====
[[File:Christian Krohg - Mother and Child - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Christian Krohg]]: ''Mother and Child'', 1883]]
William Sears states that any sleeping arrangement that a family practices is acceptable as long as it works; but he advises mother to sleep close to the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |p=78, 173}}; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He thinks of [[co-sleeping]] as the ideal arrangement and refers to it as the nighttime equivalent of babywearing: co-sleeping supports, in his opinion, the mother-child-attachment, makes breastfeeding more convenient, and prevents not only [[anxiety|separation anxiety]], but [[Sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]], too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |p=173}}; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=90, 92–95, 102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sears is convinced that mother and child, in spite of frequent nighttime breastfeeding, have the best sleep when they sleep close together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=92–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also convinced that due to the extra nighttime feedings, a child that sleeps close to the mother thrives better than a child "crying, alone, behind bars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=93f }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Katie Allison Granju argued that co-sleeping is beneficial for children, too, because it gives children a vivid notion of the concept of bedtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Granju |first1=Katie Allison |last2=Kennedy |first2=Betsy |title=Attachment Parenting: Instinctive Care for Your Baby and Young Child |location=New York, NY |publisher=Pocket Books |year=1999 |isbn=0-671-02762-X |pages=188f }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of co-sleeping was not new in modern Western societies; as early as in 1976, Tine Thevenin had campaigned for the "family bed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thevenin |first=Tine |title=The Family Bed | orig-year=1976 | year=1987 |publisher=Avery Pub. Group |location=Wayne, NJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sears doesn't see a problem when a 3 year old still shares his mother's bed every night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |p=174}};  {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=95, 97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He doesn't even object if a child is in the habit of literally spending the whole night with her mother's nipple in her mouth, except when the mother really feels uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sears advises working mothers to co-sleep on all accounts in order to compensate the child for her daytime absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=133, 139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a very rare incident; it occurs in less than ½ per mill of all infants. James J. McKenna ([[University of Notre Dame]]) has discovered that co-sleeping mothers and infants not only synchronize their [[circadian rhythm|sleep-wake-rhythm]], but their breathing, too; he therefore reasons that co-sleeping lowers the SIDS risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKenna |first=James J. |title=Sleep and arousal patterns of co-sleeping human mother/infant pairs: A preliminary physiological study with implications for the study of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) | journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=83 |issue=3|year=1990 |pages=331–347 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.1330830307/abstract |doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330830307 |pmid=2252080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, studies that investigate SIDS ''directly'' have shown that permanent bed sharing rather raises the SIDS risk than lowering it; it is worth noting that in the study, the increased risk of SIDS occurred in infants younger than four months when the parents were especially tired, had consumed alcohol, were smokers, slept on a sofa, or the baby was in a duvet. Otherwise, no increased risk was associated with bed sharing. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blair |first=P.S. |title=Babies sleeping with parents: case-control study of factors influencing the risk of the sudden infant death syndrome : Cot death—the story so far | journal=British Medical Journal |volume=319 |issue=7223 |year=1999 |pages=1457–1462 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/319/7223/1457.short |doi=10.1136/bmj.319.7223.1457}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] also warns against co-sleeping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/PRHTML99/99175.html CPSC Warns Against Placing Babies in Adult Beds; Study finds 64 deaths each year from suffocation and strangulation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618130458/http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/PRHTML99/99175.html |date=2006-06-18 }}, Consumer Product Safety Commission, September 29, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment Parenting International issued a response which stated that the data referenced in the Consumer Product Safety Commission statement were unreliable, and that co-sponsors of the campaign had created a conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.attachmentparenting.org/support/articles/cosleepcritique.php |title=Attachment parenting international calls on government to delay campaign warning parents not to sleep with their babies |accessdate=2014-01-14 |publisher=Attachment Parenting International |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130807102537/http://www.attachmentparenting.org/support/articles/cosleepcritique.php |archivedate = 2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Academy of Pediatrics' policy on SIDS prevention opposes bed-sharing with infants, although room-sharing is encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.106.3.e41 |title=Unsafe Sleep Practices and an Analysis of Bedsharing Among Infants Dying Suddenly and Unexpectedly: Results of a Four-Year, Population-Based, Death-Scene Investigation Study of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Related Deaths |year=2000 |first1=James S. |last1=Kemp |first2=Benjamin |last2=Unger |first3=Davida |last3=Wilkins |first4=Rose M. |last4=Psara |first5=Terrance L. |last5=Ledbetter |first6=Michael A. |last6=Graham |first7=Mary |last7=Case |first8=Bradley T. |last8=Thach |journal=Pediatrics |volume=106 |issue=3 |pages=e41 |pmid=10969125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, research doesn't confirm an advantage of co-sleeping over separate beds. A [[meta analysis|meta study]] from [[Israel]] has pointed out in 2000 that sleeping aids such as [[pacifier]]s and [[teddy bear]]s significantly improve the child's sleep, while co-sleeping and frequent nighttime breastfeeding if anything hinder the formation of wholesome sleeping patterns.&lt;ref name="ib"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benhamou |first=Isabelle |title=Sleep Disorders of Early Childhood: A Review | journal=Israel Journal of Psychiatry and Related Sciences |year=2000 |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=190–196 |url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/ff244386c43b4c861a8b94b6b94f2165/1?pq-origsite=gscholar }}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-sleeping mothers breastfeed 3 times as frequently during the night as mothers who have their bed for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKenna |first=James |title=Experimental studies of infant-parent co-sleeping: mutual physiological and behavioral influences and their relevance to SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) |journal=Early Human Development |year=1994 |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=187–201 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378378294902119 |doi=10.1016/0378-3782(94)90211-9|pmid=7821263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most important factor for a good sleep of the child proved to be the mother's emotional accessibility, not her permanent physical closeness.&lt;ref name="ib"/&gt;

==== "Crying is an attachment tool" ====
[[File:Human-Male-White-Newborn-Baby-Crying.jpg|thumb|Crying newborn]]
William Sears determines [[crying]] as the child's pivotal mean of self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents are challenged to "read" the crying – which is initially generalized – and to provide the child with empathic feedback in order help him to differentiate and elaborate the repertoire of his signals gradually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=81f }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he recommends ''prevention'' of crying: parents are advised not only to practice breastfeeding, babywearing and co-sleeping as much as possible, but also to get into the habit of properly responding to the early warning signals so that crying doesn't happen in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=82f }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, parents must teach their child that some trivial occasions are no cause for alarm at all.&lt;ref&gt;Sears names the method of playing bagatelles down the "Caribbean approach"; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=83f, 88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, Sears argues that infants should never been left crying because this would harm them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |p=165, 169}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.askdrsears.com/topics/health-concerns/fussy-baby/why-do-babies-cry |title=Why do babies cry |access-date=2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as early as in  1962, [[T. Berry Brazelton]] had shown in a study that a certain amount of crying in young infants does not indicate emotional or physical problems, but is to be considered normal and harmless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brazelton |first=T. Berry|title=Crying in Infancy |journal=Pediatrics |year=April 1962 |volume=29|issue=4|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/29/4/579?variant=short&amp;sso=1&amp;sso_redirect_count=2&amp;nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3A%20No%20local%20token&amp;nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3a+No+local+token }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== No sleep training ====
William Sears names two reasons why infants should not undergo [[infant sleep training|sleep training]]: he believes that infant training hardens the mother emotionally and that children who underwent such training don't sleep better but merely resign and become [[apathy|apathic]], a state that he refers to as "shutdown syndrome", although a condition of this name doesn't exist in [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] or [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=121ff, 126f }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frissell-Deppe and Granju believe that sleep training is [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]] for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frissell-Deppe |first=Tammy |title=Every Parent's Guide to Attachment Parenting: Getting back to basic instincts! |location=Dracut, MA |publisher=J.E.D.

Sears argues that advocates of sleep training are professionally incompetent and merely business oriented, and that there is no scientific proof that sleep training is beneficial for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=120, 124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Balance ====
For parents and particularly for mothers, attachment parenting is more strenuous and demanding 
than most other present-day ways of parenting, placing high responsibility on them without allowing for a support network of helpful friends or family. William Sears is fully aware of the arduousness of the methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=107 }}; compare {{cite book |last=Frissell-Deppe |first=Tammy|title=Every Parent's Guide to Attachment Parenting: Getting back to basic instincts! |location=Dracut, MA |publisher=J.E.D. Publishing |year=1998 |isbn=0-9666341-4-4 |pages=introduction }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests a whole package of measures that aim to prevent an emotional [[occupational burnout|burnout]] of the mother, like the prioritization and delegation of duties and responsibilities, streamlining of daily routines, and collaboration between both parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=107–110, 112–117, 143ff }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sears advises mothers to turn to a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapist]] if necessary, but to stick to attachment parenting at all costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=109, 117f }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sears finds the burden of attachment parenting just and reasonable, and describes the opponents of this philosophy as ''"autoritarian males […] caught up in their role of advice giver"''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Granju, too, takes a swipe at ''"the male dominated ′scientific′ childcare guidance"''. She argues that the low reputation that breastfeeding, namely extended breastfeeding in the Western world has, arises from a [[sexualization]] of the female [[breast]]: from the perspective of a [[sexism|sexistic]] society, the breast "belongs" to men, not to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Granju |first1=Katie Allison |last2=Kennedy |first2=Betsy |title=Attachment Parenting: Instinctive Care for Your Baby and Young Child |location=New York, NY |publisher=Pocket Books |year=1999 |isbn=0-671-02762-X |pages=268, 304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mayim Bialik]], too, considers attachment a [[feminism|feminist]] option, since it constitutes an alternative to the – male dominated – superiority of physicians who traditionally shaped the spheres of [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], and [[mother]]hood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/04/30/motherhood-vs-feminism/attachment-parenting-is-feminism |title=Attachment Parenting Is Feminism |newspaper=The New York Times|date=2012-05-01|access-date=2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since attachment parenting poses a considerable challenge to the reconcilability of motherhood and [[Women in the workforce|female career]], the philosophy has been greatly criticized, most notably in the context of the [[#Controversy|attachment parenting controversy]] from 2012.

=== Parental authority ===
Sears states that in attachment families, parents and children practice a highly developed and sophisticated type of communication that makes it unnecessary for parents to use practices such as scolding; often, all it takes is a mere frown. He is convinced that children who trust their parents are cooperative and don't resist parental guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |pages=215, 236ff}}; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=152 }}; {{cite web | url=http://www.askdrsears.com/topics/parenting/discipline-behavior/attachment-parenting-discipline |title=10 Ways Attachment Parenting Discipline is Easier |access-date=2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore recommends [[positive discipline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But in contrast to many AP parents, he isn’t fundamentally opposed to confrontative methods (''firm, corrective response''), and he gives high significance to child [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] and [[conscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.askdrsears.com/topics/parenting/discipline-behavior/discipline-for-children |title=Healthy discipline for children |access-date=2015-01-29}}; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=William |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Discipline Book: Everything You Need to Know to Have a Better-Behaved Child From Birth to Age Ten |year=1995 }}; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=17–21, 29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sears is a decided advocate for [[Parenting styles#Authoritative parenting|authoritative parenting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |pages=237f}}; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As studies have shown, it is indeed possible to use discipline strategies that are sensitive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Zeijl |first1=J. |last2=Mesman |first2=J. |last3=Van Ijzendoorn |first3=M.H. |last4=Bakermans-Kranenburg |first4=M.

== In theory ==

=== Claim ===
Like Benjamin Spock before them, William and Martha Sears consider their parenting philosophy as a [[common sense]] and instinct-guided [[ad hoc]] way of parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=William |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Hachette |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7595-2603-7 |pages=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Spock who derived his ideas in a straight line from [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]’s [[psychoanalysis]], the Searses in fact didn’t start out from a [[theory]]; even the tie to attachment theory was only engineered ex post, when the philosophy was already largely complete. Apart from Liedloff’s rather eclectic thoughts, they came to their ideas mainly from their own personal impressions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=2f, 8, 10, 26f }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Bill Sears, Martha Sears&lt;ref name="apb_ix" /&gt;
}}

Despite the lack of a consistent theory, William and Martha Sears consider attachment parenting scientifically proven:

}}

Their belief in such scientific proof doesn’t hinder the Searses to advise AP parents not to engage in discussions with AP critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=127f }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also favor some science while they refuse other:

=== Fundamental terms and criticism ===
Critics consider a lack of a consistent theoretical foundation – notably the lack of precise definitions of the fundamental terms – a shortcoming of the attachment parenting concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahaparenting.com/parenting-tools/attachment-parenting/Pros-and-cons |title=Attachment Parenting Pros and Cons}} {{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/08/the-perils-of-attachment-parenting/375198/ |title=The Perils of Attachment Parenting }} {{cite web |url=http://www.parentingscience.com/attachment-parenting.html |title=The science of attachment parenting}} {{cite web |url=http://childrensmd.org/browse-by-age-group/toddler-pre-school/attunement-parenting-the-new-attachment-parenting/ |title="Attunement Parenting"—The New Attachment Parenting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sensitivity ====
[[File:Mother-Child face to face.jpg|thumb|Contingency: Mother and child in emotional harmony]]
The concept of mutual emotional fine-tuning has been known in [[psychology]] since [[Franz Mesmer]], who introduced it under the term "[[rapport]]", before Freud adopted it for psychoanalysis. In relation to the mother-child-tie, [[behaviorism|behaviorists]] and developmental psychologists rather speak of "contingency" today; [[Daniel Stern (psychologist)|Daniel Stern]] coined the term "attunement", too.

For Williams Sears, attachment parenting is a kind of parenting that is radically characterized by maternal responsivity. For that, he adopted [[Mary Ainsworth]]’s term of "maternal [[sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]]": The woman directs her attention completely on the child ("[[#Babyreading|babyreading]]") and responds continuously to every signal that the child sends; the result is a state of harmony between mother and child that leads to mutual attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |pages=29, 67ff, 107, 184}}; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=2, 5, 7ff }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sears believes that the maternal "tuning-in" begins during pregnancy already.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Attachment ====
Within the framework of [[infant cognitive development]] studies, the child's [[Attachment in children|attachment]] to the parents has been well researched. As early as in the late 1940s, [[Donald Winnicott]] gave a detailed account of the development of the child's attachment; at the latest after the sixth month, healthy children begin to disengage from the mother-child symbiosis quite normally. However, it was [[Margaret Mahler]] who gave the most accurate description of the attachment development during the first three years. William Sears’ publications reveal no knowledge of this relevant literature.

Sears’ use of the term "attachment" is merely [[colloquialism|colloquial]]. He applies it synonymously with terms like [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], harmony, closeness, [[Affectional bond|bonding]], love bonds, and connection: ''"Attachment describes the whole caregiving relationship between mother or father and baby."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=36 }}; {{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |pages=71, 189}}&lt;/ref&gt; He mentions that attachment emerges from contingency, but in his further accounts, he never differentiates between attachment and contingency. The readers must therefore assume that attachment is a deeply vulnerable state that never stabilizes and that requires constant reestablishment through incessant sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=5, 8f, 11, 16, 20, 23, 36–39, 45ff, 49, 92, 130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the book, in contradiction to his own preceding statements, Sears reassures [[Adoption|adoptive parents]]: ''"Don't worry about the attachment your child may have ’missed’ in foster care. Infants are extremely [[Psychological resilience|resilient]]."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Insecure attachment ====
The establishment of a secure mother-child attachment is the declared and pivotal goal of attachment parenting.

In numerous scientific studies, the normal development of attachment has been well documented. The same applies for deviant or pathological developments. Problematic or disturbed attachment has been described in three contexts: 
*In extreme and rare conditions, the child may not form an attachment at all and may suffer from [[reactive attachment disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Schechter D.S and E. Willheim (2009).

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690512/ Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America 18 (3): 665–86]&lt;/ref&gt; Children who suffer from reactive attachment disorder have often experienced extremely traumatic childhoods with a lot of neglect and abuse. An example of such a case is for children in orphanages in Romania where babies have been known to be left for 18–20 hours by themselves in their cribs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/24/magazine/the-disconnected-attachment-theory-the-ultimate-experiment.html|title=The Disconnected; Attachment Theory: The Ultimate Experiment|date = 1998-05-24|access-date = 2015-04-14|website = The New York Times|publisher = The New York Times|last = Talbot|first = Margaret}}&lt;/ref&gt; As adults, people with reactive attachment disorder show severe emotional abnormalities and a severely impaired social behavior.

*A third group of problematic attachment is constituted by the types of [[Attachment theory#Attachment patterns|insecure-avoidant]] and [[Attachment theory#Attachment patterns|insecure-ambivalent attachment]], both described by Mary Ainsworth, too. Children who are insecurely attached behave in the strange situation test either aloof towards their mothers, or they fluctuate between clinginess and rejection. As Beatrice Beebe ([[Columbia University]]) has substantiated in a study in 2010, these children experience from their mothers constantly behavior like under- or overstimulation, intrusiveness or volatility. Nonetheless, their mothers displayed empathy and were fully able to respond to their children's emotional expressions appropriately; the children showed no signs of emotional distress.&lt;ref name="beebe"/&gt; Insecure attachment as defined by Ainsworth is very common and applies for example in the U.&amp;nbsp;S. to about 1 out of 3 children.&lt;ref name="IK" /&gt;

William Sears uses the terms "lesser quality of attachment", "insecure attachment", and "non-attachment" synonymously. His formulations don't reveal which kind of problematic attachment is meant: reactive attachment disorder (ICD), desorganized attachment (Ainsworth) or the two forms of insecure attachment (Ainsworth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |pages=183}}; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=William |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book : A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Hachette |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7595-2603-7 |pages=16f}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.attachmentparenting.org/support/articles/artadoption.php |title=

Sears offers a discrimation between (good) attachment and (bad) [[enmeshment]], but again without explaining to his readers how exactly they can identify the difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=108f }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Need ====
[[File:Lactancia en tandem 1.jpg|thumb|William Sears assumes that even toddlers can have a need for breastfeeding.]]
The theoretical starting point of attachment parenting – the idea of contingency – would suggest a concept of the infant as a creature who is essentially defined by his ''feelings'' and his ''communication''. William Sears, though, defines infants even more essentially by their ''[[need]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |pages=162, 182}}; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=12, 84, 90, 95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Need is therefore another basic term; attachment parenting means quintessentially to attend to the child's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=1, 5, 7f, 10, 27, 31, 41–43, 78, 83f, 106ff, 131, 151, 155, 157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as in the 1940s, psychologists such as [[Abraham Maslow]] shaped detailed models of the human needs; ever since, scientists have made a clear distinction between needs on the one hand and [[desire]]s on the other hand. In 2000, [[T. Berry Brazelton]], a pioneer in the field of newborn psychology, and child psychiatrist [[Stanley Greenspan]] published their book ''The Irreducible Needs of Children'', in which they re-assessed the term for pediatrics. When the Searses published their ''Attachment Parenting Book'' one year later, they responded neither to Maslow nor to Brazelton and Greenspan, but used the word ''need'' merely in a colloquial sense. Although they stressed that parents must distinguish between ''needs'' and ''desires'' of children, in particular of older children, they denied their readers a guideline of how to tell needs and desires apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=9, 28, 31, 101, 115, 118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a view to infants, they believe that needs and desires are plainly identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, they use both terms synonymously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |pages=167}}; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=23, 29, 30, 32, 44, 56, 60, 74, 77, 144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a view to toddlers, they often phrase it: a child is ''not ready yet'' (to do without breastfeeding, without co-sleeping, etc.); but even in contexts like these, they speak of ''needs'', too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=63, 97f, 101 }}; {{cite book |last1=Granju |first1=Katie Allison |last2=Kennedy |first2=Betsy |title=Attachment Parenting: Instinctive Care for Your Baby and Young Child |location=New York, NY |publisher=Pocket Books |year=1999 |isbn=0-671-02762-X |pages=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of attachment parenting have questioned that the behavior of a 3½ year old who still demands to nurse can actually be classified as a ''need''. Most likely the child is seeking [[consolation]]. To give a child comfort is an important parental responsibility; but parents are just as well liable to teach their child to take heart by his own power.&lt;ref name="savvy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.savvymom.ca/index.php/expert_blog/attachment-parenting |title=Attachment Parenting |access-date=2015-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stress ====
[[File:Waaah!.jpg|thumb|Should parents give comfort or teach composure?]]
[[Stress (psychological)|Stress]] has been surveyed and documented in many studies. The theoretical foundation was created in the 1960s by [[Richard Lazarus]]. In 1974, [[Hans Selye]] introduced the differentiation between [[Stress (psychological)#Distress|distress]] and [[eustress]], and in 1984, psychoanalyst [[Heinz Kohut]] proposed the concept of ''optimal frustration''; Kohut postulated that the harmony between parents and child needs some well allotted disruption in order to empower the child to develop a healthy [[personality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohut |first=Heinz |title=How Does Analysis Cure? |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Psychological resilience|resilience psychology]], too, there is broad agreement today that it harms children if their parents keep any stress away from them indiscriminately; by doing so, they suggest to the child that everyday problems are painful and overall to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.csaschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/helicopter-parents-article-with-Jan-08-letter.pdf |last=Cooper |first=Carolyn C. |title=Band-aids, Safety Nets, and Escape Routes: How "Helicopter Parents" May Be Harming Their Children |access-date=2015-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though stress is one of the fundamental terms of attachment parenting, William Sears’ publications don't reveal acquaintance with pertinent literature about this topic.&lt;ref name="savvy"/&gt; Sears links stress and distress with the release of [[cortisol]], but uses both terms synonymously and in a purely colloquial sense. He refers the term to any uncomfortable or frustrating state which makes the child cry – a signal which AP mothers are supposed to carefully attend to since stress sickens the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |pages=182}}; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=15, 17f, 38, 40, 63, 83–85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Sears advises mothers not to overreact and to teach the child imperturbation ("Caribbean approach").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=83, 87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He leaves it up to the parents to decide which type of response individual situations ask for.

For parenting, any fuzziness of the term ''stress'' as well as of the term ''need'' have far-reaching consequences. If it is assumed that any crying of the child indicates harmful stress and that any of his demands indicate a true need, parents are bound to confuse rapport, sensitivity, responsivity, emotional availability, and wise protection with behaviors that, from an educational standpoint, are highly dysfunctional and that William Sears mostly wouldn't agree with himself:
*with anxious continuous monitoring of the child&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=15, 77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*with [[Helicopter parent|over-parenting]], that is the continuous removal of such problems which the child could actually cope with herself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mogel |first=Wendy |title=The Blessings of a Skinned Knee |year=2001 }}; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Instinct and nature ====
[[File:Mali - Mother with baby.jpg|thumb|Mother with child in [[Mali]] (2006)]]
[[Instinct]] is another basic term of attachment parenting. The Searses describe attachment parenting as the [[Nature|natural]], biological, [[intuition|intuitive]] and spontaneous behavior of mothers who rely on their instincts, [[Extrasensory perception|sixth sense]], inner wisdom or [[common sense]].&lt;ref name="natur"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |pages=29, 32, 45, 88, 91f, 96, 166, 176, 241}}; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=ix, 1, 3ff, 7f, 11, 16f, 23, 26, 30, 34, 36, 38f, 48, 53, 56, 70, 84, 86, 120f, 124, 147, 155 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They attribute even motherliness itself to instincts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas they attest [[Man|men]] a reduced instinct for children's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=114, 153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instinct theory developed in the 1930s within the framework of [[ethology]]. It owes its basic ideas to [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] among others, and its elaboration mainly to [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]]. Lorenz believed that instincts are physiological processes, and assumed they could be described as neuronal circuitry in the brain. But already [[Arnold Gehlen]] had disputed that humans still have much instinct at their disposal; for him, plasticity and learning aptitude outranked instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gehlen |first=Arnold |title=Anthropologische Forschung |publisher=Rowohlt |location=Reinbek |year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today's research, the term instinct is regarded as absolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/instinct.aspx |title=encyclopedia.com: Instinct |access-date=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have demonstrated that motherly behavior is not inbred but biologically and socially determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blaffer-Hrdy |first=Sarah |title=A History of Mothers, Infants, and Natural Selection |publisher=Pantheon |year=1999 |isbn=0-679-44265-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is partly triggered by [[oxytocin]], partly learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/mutterliebe-das-staerkste-gefuehl-entschluesselt-a-415306.html |title=Mutterliebe: Das stärkste Gefühl entschlüsselt|magazine=Der Spiegel|date=2006-05-14 |access-date=2015-01-29}} ; {{cite web | url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/pregnancy-and-parenting/is-mothering-instinctive-or-learned.htm |title=Is mothering instinctive or learned? |access-date=2015-01-29}}; {{cite journal |last1=Kinsley |first1=Craig Howard |last2=Lambert |first2=Kelly G. |title=The Maternal Brain |journal=Scientific American |volume=294 |year=January 2006 |pages=72–79 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-maternal-brain/ |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0106-72}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2010/10/mommy-brain.aspx |title=The Real ‘Mommy Brain’: New Mothers Grew Bigger Brains Within Months of Giving Birth |access-date=2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Sears' writings show no knowledge of this current state of research. The Searses use the word instinct in a purely colloquial sense and synonymous with terms like ''hormonal'' and ''natural'';&lt;ref name="natur"/&gt; as an antipole of instinct and nature, they identify the things that "childcare advisors" say.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=26f, 120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|If you were on an island, and you had no mothers-in-law, no psychologists, no doctors around, no experts, this is what you would naturally and instinctively do to give your baby the best investment you'll ever give.|William Sears, Martha Sears&lt;ref name="Little, Brown and Company"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

William Sears, who owes his formative impressions to Jean Liefloff, points to mammals, [[primate]]s, "other", "primitive", and "traditional cultures", namely on [[Bali]] and in [[Zambia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=26, 60, 62, 65–68, 74, 79, 89, 110, 122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental psychologist Heidi Keller who comparatively researched the mother-child relationship in a large bandwidth of cultures, disputes that attachment parenting can be described as a return to a "natural motherliness", like many supporters advertise it. Keller doesn't rank attachment parenting as a counteragent to the high-tech world, but asserts that it ''"paradoxically fits optimally into a society of individualists and lone warriors how we experience it in the Western world"''. Many of the methods that the representatives of attachment parenting attribute to the [[evolutionary history of life]] don't actually play the major role in non-western cultures that is attributed to them. In [[Cameroon]] for example, children are actually carried in a sling initially, but then have to learn to sit and to walk much earlier than European and North American children; rather than to cultivate affectionate eye contact, mothers blow into their children's face in order to get them out of the habit of making eye contact.&lt;ref name="urform"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fr-online.de/wissenschaft/umgang-mit-kindern--urform-der-mutterliebe-gibt-es-nicht-,1472788,25804470.html | title=Urform der Mutterliebe gibt es nicht | access-date=2015-01-13 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114032752/http://www.fr-online.de/wissenschaft/umgang-mit-kindern--urform-der-mutterliebe-gibt-es-nicht-,1472788,25804470.html | archive-date=2015-01-14 | dead-url=yes | df= }}; {{cite web | url=http://respectfulparent.com/ten-problems-attachment-parenting/ | title=Ten Problems with Attachment Parenting | access-date=2015-01-13 }}; {{cite web | url=http://afterthemillennials.com/2012/06/04/the-mommy-wars-did-modern-mothering-became-a-monastic-servitude-contest/ | title=The mommy wars – did modern mothering become a monastic servitude contest? | access-date=2015-01-20 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120221636/http://afterthemillennials.com/2012/06/04/the-mommy-wars-did-modern-mothering-became-a-monastic-servitude-contest/ | archive-date=2015-01-20 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in the [[United States]], there are [[minority groups]] which can be classified as highly "traditional", none of them practicing attachment parenting.

=== Optimal development of the child ===
As Suzanne M. Cox ([[Northwestern University]]) has pointed out, neither attachment theory nor attachment parenting offer a general outline of the optimal development of the child, which could be used to empirically measure the efficacy of attachment parenting.&lt;ref name="cox"&gt;Cox, Suzanne M.: ''Bridging Attachment Theory and Attachment Parenting with Feminist Methods of Inquiry.'' 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Searses promise parenting results such as increased independence, [[confidence]], health, physical growth, improved development of the [[motor skill|motor]] and [[language development|language skills]], [[etiquette|good manners]], [[conscientiousness]], [[social competence]], sense of justice, [[altruism]], sensitivity, empathy, [[attentional control|concentration]], [[self-control]], and [[intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |pages=182}}; {{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=11–25, 32–34, 71f, 152, 164 }} On his website, Sears even suggests that with attachment parenting, there would have been no [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]: {{cite web | url=http://www.askdrsears.com/topics/parenting/discipline-behavior/attachment-parenting-discipline |title=10 Ways Attachment Parenting Discipline is Easier |access-date=2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no conclusive evidence from empirical research that supports such claims.&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt;

The ultimate target of child rearing is, according to Sears, [[happiness]].&lt;ref name="happy"/&gt; Similar to the German [[Catholic Church|catholic]] Albert Wunsch, Sears therefore ranks among those parenting advisors whose philosophies reflect stray aspects of their [[Belief#Religion|religious beliefs]], but result in a purely worldly target. In the year of the publication of the ''Attachment Parenting Book'', [[Wendy Mogel]], by contrast, suggested her own very influential concept of [[character education]] that was straightforwardly based on her [[Judaism|Jewish faith]] (''The Blessings of a Skinned Knee'', 2001).

In Europe, ''Attachment Parenting Europe'' (APEU, in [[Lelystad]], Netherlands) campaigns for attachment parenting; in the [[Dutch language]] the philosophy is referred to as ''natuurlijk ouderschap'' (''natural parenthood'').

== {{Anchor|Controversy}}Controversy ==
Since 2012, there has been a controversy about Sears' positions which has been mostly carried out in the [[English-speaking world]].

It began in 2012 with a cover picture on the [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] that showed a [[California]]n mother breastfeeding her almost 4-year-old. In the accompanying article ''The Man Who Remade Motherhood'', journalist Kate Pickert argued that even if William Sears' positions are much less radical than those of his followers, they are misogynic and give mothers a chronically guilty conscience, and that they frequently disagree with relevant research results.&lt;ref name="pickCase"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pickert |first=Kate |title= The Man Who Remade Motherhood |newspaper=Time Magazine |date=2012-05-21 }} {{cite web | url=https://achildgrows.com/blog/2009/04/the-case-against-dr-sears/ |title=The Case Against Dr. Sears |access-date=2015-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover picture and article became the starting point of agitated disputes in many media.

At the same time, attachment parenting attracted attention of [[sociology|sociologist]]s like Ellie Lee, Charlotte Faircloth, Jan Macvarish, and [[Frank Furedi]] who described the phenomenon an example of 21st century ''Parental Determinism''. As early as in 1996, sociologist Sharon Hays had described the sociocultural phenomenon of an ''Intensive Mothering''; with attachment parenting, this phenomenon finally became tangible and recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hays |first=Sharon |title=The Cultural Contradictions of Motherhood |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, media critic [[Susan J. Douglas]] and philosopher Meredith W. Michaels followed with their account of a ''New Momism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Douglas |first1=Susan |last2=Michaels |first2=Meredith |title=The Mommy Myth. The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined Women |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Time'' cover picture and article ===
''Time'' cover picture and article were published May 21, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20120521,00.html |title=Are You Mom Enough? (Titelseite) |access-date=2015-01-21 }}; {{cite news |url=http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/blogs/promileaks/2115/der-busen-des-anstosses/ |last=Haas |first=Michaela |title=Der Busen des Anstoßes |newspaper=Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin |date=2013-03-25 |access-date=2015-01-22 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pickert described how parents who follow Sears tend to take opinions that are much more radical than Sears himself.&lt;ref name="pickert"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pickert |first=Kate |title= The Man Who Remade Motherhood |newspaper=Time Magazine |date=2012-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many parents catch from Sears' books an outlook that Pickert jestingly describes as a ''"post-traumatic Sears disorder"'': a severe sense of insufficiency that seems to appear in particular in such mothers who ''want'' to follow Sears' advice, for the sake of their children's mental health, but ''cannot'', e.g. because they can't afford to be stay-at-home-moms.&lt;ref name="pickCase"/&gt;

=== "Parental tribalism" ===
[[Katha Pollitt]] referred to attachment parenting as a [[fad]].&lt;ref name="pollitt"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.thenation.com/article/167928/attachment-parenting-more-guilt-mother# |title=Attachment Parenting: More Guilt for Mother |access-date=2015-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents who follow the philosophy have been reproached as acting according to their own helplessness and unsatisfied emotional neediness which may be the true reasons for their decision to incessantly pacify their child by breastfeeding and babywearing even into toddlerhood, as the belief that the child actually needs all that permanent intimacy for his healthy development is only a subterfuge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-narcissism-epidemic/201112/the-easiest-way-mess-your-child |title=The Easiest Way to Mess up Your Child | journal=Psychology Today|date=2011-12-14 |access-date=2015-01-17 }} {{cite web | url=http://www.psychalive.org/the-problem-with-narcissistic-parents/ |title=The Problem with Narcissistic Parents |access-date=2015-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emma Jenner argued that parents who are in the habit of stereotypically attending to each of the child's signals with physical proximity will not learn to perceive the child's needs in the full extend of their bandwidth and complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/08/the-perils-of-attachment-parenting/375198/ |last=Jenner |first=Emma |title=The Perils of Attachment Parenting |access-date=2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katie Allison Granju, who advocates attachment parenting and who published comprehensive guidelines for AP parents, offers a different perspective. She characterizes attachment parenting as not just a parenting style, but ''"a completely fulfilling [[Lifestyle (sociology)|way of life]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Granju |first1=Katie Allison |last2=Kennedy |first2=Betsy |title=Attachment Parenting: Instinctive Care for Your Baby and Young Child |location=New York, NY |publisher=Pocket Books |year=1999 |isbn=0-671-02762-X |pages=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist Jan Macvarish ([[University of Kent]]), a pioneer in the recent field of parenting culture study, described how AP parents utilize their parenting philosophy as a strategy of individualization, as a way to find personal identity and to join a group of congenial adults. Macvarish even speaks of ''parental tribalism''. According to Macvarish, it is characteristic for such choices that they are much more angled towards the parents' self-perception than towards the child's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kent.ac.uk/chss/staff/research/macvarish.html | title=Jan Macvarish's web site | access-date=2015-01-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118014948/http://www.kent.ac.uk/chss/staff/research/macvarish.html | archivedate=2016-01-18 | df= }}; {{cite web |url=http://www.skepticalob.com/2013/02/attachment-parenting-is-about-the-need-of-parents-for-validation-not-the-needs-of-children.html |title=Attachment parenting is about the need of parents for validation, not the needs of children |access-date=2015-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Charlotte Faircloth, too, considers attachment parenting a strategy that women pursue in order to gain and to express [[Identity formation|personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Faircloth |first=Charlotte |title=Militant Lactivism? Attachment parenting and intensive motherhood in the UK and France |publisher=Berghahn |location= |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-85745-758-5 |pages=15ff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child-rearing and lifestyle preferences of AP parents ===
Multiple authors have stated that many parents choose attachment parenting as part of an individualization strategy and as a statement of personal identity and of social affiliation. This assumption is supported by the observation that most AP parents show further distinctive parenting and life style preferences that are based on a particular set of attitudes (notably: a striving for naturalness), which, however, are mostly not directly tied to the declared goal of attachment parenting:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://afterthemillennials.com/2012/06/04/the-mommy-wars-did-modern-mothering-became-a-monastic-servitude-contest/ | title=The mommy wars – did modern mothering become a monastic servitude contest? | access-date=2015-01-20 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120221636/http://afterthemillennials.com/2012/06/04/the-mommy-wars-did-modern-mothering-became-a-monastic-servitude-contest/ | archive-date=2015-01-20 | dead-url=yes | df= }}; {{cite web |url=http://bringbirthhome.com/attachment-parenting/attachment-parenting-rules/ |title=Attachment Parenting Rules?! |access-date=2015-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some practices and preferences of AP parents are prevalent only in North America:
* decline of infant [[circumcision]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |pages=59f}}; {{cite book |last=Frissell-Deppe |first=Tammy |title=Every Parent's Guide to Attachment Parenting: Getting back to basic instincts! |location=Dracut, MA |publisher=J.E.D.

The Sears encourage some of these practices explicitly, for example non-smoking, healthy and home-prepared food, no circumcision, but don't comment on how they are supposed to be linked to the core ideas of attachment parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sears |first1=Bill |last2=Sears |first2=Martha |title=The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York, Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-316-77809-5 |pages=15, 105 }} {{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |pages=59f, 137–140, 219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the case of positive discipline, the link is quite obvious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |pages=243f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist perspective ===
In his ''Complete Book of Christian Parenting and Child Care'' (1997), William Sears opposes maternal occupation, because he is convinced that it harms the child:&lt;ref name="pickert" /&gt;

{{Quotation | [Some] mothers choose to go back to their jobs quickly simply because they don't understand how disruptive that is to the well-being of their babies. So many babies in our culture are not being cared for in the way God designed, and we as a nation are paying the price.|William Sears|The Complete Book of Christian Parenting and Child Care (1997)}}

{{Quotation|Baby books (including my own) and child care experts extol the virtues of motherhood as the supreme career.|William Sears&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=William |title=Creative Parenting: How to use the new continuum concept to raise children successfully from birth to adolescence |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |location=New York |year=1983 |orig-year=1982 |isbn=0-396-08264-5 |pages=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Any form of intensive, obsessive mothering has, as Katha Pollitt stated, devastating consequences for the equality of treatment of women in the society.&lt;ref name="pollitt" /&gt; In France, [[Élisabeth Badinter]] argued that over-parenting, obsession with washable diapers and organic, home made infant food, and parenting practices as the ones recommended by Sears, with breastfeeding into toddlerhood, bring women inevitably back into outdated patterns of gender role. In the United States, Badinter's book ''The Conflict: How Modern Motherhood Undermines the Status of Women'' (2010) had a partially critical reception, because there is no publicly paid childcare leave in this country, and many women consider it a luxury to be able to be a stay-at-home-mom during the child's first years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/04/23/elisabeth-badinter-s-the-conflict-does-modern-motherhood-undermine-women.html |title=Elisabeth Badinter’s ‘The Conflict’: Does Modern Motherhood Undermine Women? |newspaper=The Daily Beast|date=2012-04-23 |access-date=2015-01-20}} {{cite news | url=http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/13/has-motherhood-replaced-sexism/?_r=0 |title=K. J. Dell’Antonia: ''Has Motherhood Replaced Sexism?'' |newspaper=The New York Times|date=2012-04-13 |access-date=2015-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, gynecologist Amy Tuteur (formerly [[Harvard Medical School]]) stated that attachment parenting amounts to a new subjection of the woman's body under social control – a trend that is more than questionable in the face to the hard-fought achievements of women's movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.skepticalob.com/2013/03/natural-childbirth-attachment-parenting-and-policing-womens-bodies.html |last=Tuteur |first= Amy|title= Natural childbirth, attachment parenting, and policing women’s bodies |access-date=2015-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Erica Jong]] observed, the rise of attachment parenting followed a surge of glamourized motherhood of popular stars ([[Angelina Jolie]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Gisele Bündchen]]) in the [[mass media]]. She stated that the effort to model exceptional children under sacrifice of the parent's own well-being transformed motherhood into a "highly competitive race"; all attempts of women to radically monopolize their parental responsibilities very much accommodate [[right-wing politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jong |first=Erica | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704462704575590603553674296 |title=Mother Madness |access-date=2015-11-02 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=2010-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A "culture of total motherhood" ===
In her 2005 book ''Perfect Madness. Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety'', [[Judith Warner]], too, described how attachment parenting has taken a strong influence on mainstream parenting and how it has established a "culture of total motherhood"; due to these cultural changes, mothers are convinced today that they have to instantly attend to every need of their children in order to protect them from the risk of livelong abandonment issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Warner |first=Judith |title=Perfect Madness. Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety |publisher=Riverhead |year=2005 |isbn=1-59448-170-9}} {{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33490-2005Feb17.html |last=Wilkinson |first=Stephanie |title= The Mommy Mystique |newspaper=Washington Post |date=2005-02-20 |access-date=2015-01-25 }} {{cite web |url=http://judithwarneronline.com/ |title=Judith Warner's web site |access-date=2015-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as in 1996, sociologist Sharon Hays wrote about a newly formed "ideology of intensive mothering". Characteristic of this ideology is the tendency to impose parenting responsibility primarily on ''mothers'' and to favor a kind of parenting that is child-centered, expert-guided, emotionally absorbing, labour- and financially intensive. Hays saw the motives for the overloading of motherhood in the idealistic endeavor to cure an overly egoistical and competitive society through a counterbalancing principle of altruistic motherliness. But according to Hays, any kind of "intensive motherhood" that systematically privileges children's needs over mothers' needs happens without fail to the economical and personal disadvantage of mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hays |first=Sharon|title=The Cultural Contradictions of Motherhood |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-300-07652-5}} {{cite web | url=http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300076523/cultural-contradictions-motherhood |title=The Cultural Contradictions of Motherhood |access-date=2016-02-23}} {{cite web | url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sharon-hays/the-cultural-contradictions-of-motherhood/ |title=The Cultural Contradictions of Motherhood |access-date=2015-01-25 }} {{cite web |last=Douglas |first=Susan |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u2uEMwHTys |title=Understanding parenting culture (video)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a team of researchers at the [[University of Mary Washington]] showed in a study that 23% of mothers who believe in ''intensive motherhood'' suffer from signs of [[Depression (mood)|depression]]; among average mothers, this applies only to 6.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rizzo |first1=Kathryn M. |last2=Schiffrin |first2=Holly H. |last3=Liss |first3=Miriam |title=Insight into the parenthood paradox: mental health outcomes of intensive mothering |journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies |volume=22 |issue=5 |year=July 2012 |pages=614–620 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2012/07/06/the-better-mother-how-intense-parenting-leads-to-depression/ |access-date=2015-01-24 |doi=10.1007/s10826-012-9615-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bed management''' is the allocation and provision of [[bed]]s, especially in a [[hospital]] where beds in specialist [[wikt:ward|ward]]s are a scarce resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ruth |last=Boaden |author2=Nathan Proudlove |author3=Melanie Wilson |title=An exploratory study of bed management |journal=Journal of Management in Medicine |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=234–50 |year=1999 |pmid=10787495 |doi=10.1108/02689239910292945 |issn=0268-9235}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2008-12-08 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The "bed" in this context represents not simply a place for the patient to sleep, but the services that go with being cared for by the medical facility:  admission processing, physician time, nursing care, necessary diagnostic work, appropriate treatment, and so forth.

In the UK, acute hospital bed management is usually performed by a dedicated team and may form part of a larger process of patient flow management.

==Importance==
Because hospital beds are economically [[Scarcity|scarce resources]], there is naturally pressure to ensure high occupancy rates and therefore a minimal buffer of empty beds. However, because the volume of emergency admissions is unpredictable, hospitals with average occupancy levels above 85 per cent "can expect to have regular bed shortages and periodic bed crises."&lt;ref name="NAO_2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/9900/inpatient_admissions_and_bed.aspx |title=Inpatient Admissions and Bed management in NHS acute hospitals |accessdate=2008-05-20 |publisher=[[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] |page=7 |date=2000-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueberry-health.co.uk/sites/health.drupal.bbconsult.co.uk/files/images/NHS-Reforms-and-the-case-for-bed-management-technology.pdf NHS reforms by the coalition government and bed management technology]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the first quarter of 2017 average overnight occupancy in English hospitals was 91.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bed occupancy rate hits record high in first quarter of 2017|url=http://healthcareleadernews.com/article/bed-occupancy-rate-hits-record-high-first-quarter-2017|accessdate=10 July 2017|publisher=Health Care Leader|date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortage of beds can result in cancellations of admissions for planned (elective) surgery, admission to inappropriate wards (medical vs. surgical, male vs. female etc.), delay admitting [[Emergency department|emergency]] patients,&lt;ref name="AuditCommission_2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/reports/NATIONAL-REPORT.asp?CategoryID=&amp;ProdID=81EE0CB0-9FED-11d7-B304-0060085F8572&amp;SectionID=sect2# |work=Bed management: Review of National Findings |accessdate=2008-05-20 |publisher=[[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]] |date=2003-06-19 |title=Patient Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transfers of existing inpatients between wards, which "will add a day to a patient’s length of stay".&lt;ref name="pmid12642528 "&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Proudlove NC, Gordon K, Boaden R |title=Can good bed management solve the overcrowding in accident and emergency departments? |journal=Emerg Med J |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=149–55 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12642528 |pmc=1726041 |doi=10.1136/emj.20.2.149|url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1726041/pdf/v020p00149.pdf|accessdate=2008-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These can be politically sensitive issues in [[Universal health care|publicly funded healthcare]] systems. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] there has been concern over inaccurate and sometimes fraudulently manipulated waiting list statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civitas.org.uk/pubs/NHSBriefingApr05.php |title=The NHS: Has the Additional Funding Worked? |accessdate=2008-05-20 |date=April 2005 |publisher=[[Civitas (think tank)|Civitas]] |pages=2–3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828175213/http://www.civitas.org.uk/pubs/NHSBriefingApr05.php |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and claims that "the current [[Emergency department|A&amp;E]] target is simply not achievable without the employment of dubious management tactics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/media/stories/resources/A%26E_Waiting_Targets_-_Les_Mayhew.pdf |title=Latest research statistically proves A&amp;E waiting times are not being met |accessdate=2008-05-20 |author=Mayhew, Les |author2=Smith, David |date=December 2006 |work=Using queuing theory to analyse completion times in accident and emergency departments in the light of the Government 4-hour target |publisher=[[Cass Business School]] |isbn=978-1-905752-06-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 two [[County Hospital, Stafford|Stafford Hospital]] nurses were struck off the [[Nurse registry|nursing register]] for falsifying A&amp;E discharge times between 2000 and 2010 to avoid breaches of four-hour waiting targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-23450764 | date = 5 July 2013 | title = Stafford nurses struck off over waiting times | publisher = [[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 [[NHS England]] started a new initiative to reduce the number of what it now called "stranded" or "super stranded" patients, super stranded being people in hospital for more 20 days. About 18,000 of the 101,259 acute and general beds in English NHS hospitals were occupied by “super stranded” patients in May 2018.  By August 2018 2,338 of these beds had been freed.  Some of the delays were related to social care, but more related to the management of inpatient stays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Performance Watch: Exclusive figures lay bare hospitals' capacity challenge |url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/expert-briefings-latest/performance-watch-exclusive-figures-lay-bare-hospitals-capacity-challenge/7023661.article? |accessdate=1 December 2018 |publisher=Health Service Journal |date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific problems==
* ''Shortage of beds due to lack of other options.''  Hospitals in developed countries cannot force a patient to leave if the patient's home is reasonably believed to be unsafe. For example, if a frail, elderly patient has recovered from an acute illness, but is unable to dress himself and prepare simple meals on his own, then the hospital must ensure that the patient will have sufficient assistance with these necessary [[activities of daily living]], or the patient must remain in the hospital.  In places with a shortage of [[skilled nursing facilities]], [[home health care]] workers, and related support organizations, beds may be unavailable for new, acutely sick patients because of the continued presence of the previous patients.  This is sometimes known as a "bed blocking".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/wales/4447393.stm Bed blocking threat to A&amp;E unit] and [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/6193318.stm Bed blocking], from the [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''False appearance or unnecessary creation of a bed shortage.''  "Bed hiding", as it is sometimes called, is the practice of delaying admissions due to a falsely claimed lack of beds in the appropriate department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.uchc.edu/headlines/2006/apr06/patientwaiting.html Patients Wait for Hours in Hallways; Strain Felt Throughout State] New Haven Register, April 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bed hiding has several causes, including scheduling so many elective procedures that there are inadequate beds left for emergency admissions; frequent changes from ward to ward; inadequate communication, so that cleaning staff don't know when a bed has become available and needs cleaning; misalignment of tasks, so that skilled nurses are expected to take time away from direct patient care to clean beds; too few nurses scheduled for a shift; and overworked staff, who may be inclined to mis-report a bed as full, especially at the end of a shift, in an effort to shift the workload to another person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2195851/pagenum/all/ How hospitals are killing E.R. patients] at [[Slate.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2008/PsyBdLR.htm Psychiatric boarding] at U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/ref&gt;  Bed hiding can be significantly reduced by careful tracking of bed status, making cleaning after discharge the top priority for cleaning staff, and even by physically moving patients to the ward as soon as they are ready for admission rather than boarding them in the emergency department.  Reducing bed hiding in regular wards can reduce wait times in the emergency department.

The infants use their sense of smell in finding the nipple. The areola smells similar to amniotic fluid, the baby recognizes this smell on its hands and begins to move towards the breast. As shown in a 1994 study in which one of the breasts was washed with unscented soap and the baby preferred the other one.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They also use visual stimuli (such as the mother's face and the breast's [[areola]]) and auditory (the mother's voice).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4218">The '''British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology''' ('''BSSSP''') was founded in 1913, "to advance a particularly radical agenda in the field of sex reform, based on the writings of gurus such as [[Edward Carpenter|[Edward] Carpenter]] and [[Havelock Ellis|[Havelock] Ellis]]."&lt;ref&gt;Lesley A. Hall, '"Disinterested Enthusiasm for Sexual Misconduct": The British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology, 1913-47', ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 30, No. 4 (Oct. 1995),  pp.665-686&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 the Society was renamed the '''British Sexological Society'''.&lt;ref name=Ives&gt;[http://research.hrc.utexas.edu:8080/hrcxtf/view?docId=ead/00060.xml George Cecil Ives: An Inventory of His Papers] at the [[Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]]&lt;/ref&gt;
It seems to have continued until some point in the 1940s.

The society was particularly concerned with [[homosexuality]], aiming to combat legal discrimination against homosexuality with scientific understanding. Members included [[George Cecil Ives]],&lt;ref name=Ives/&gt; [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Montague Summers]], [[Stella Browne]],  [[Laurence Housman]], [[Havelock Ellis]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], and [[Ernest Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;David C.

A '''carbohydrate''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑːr|b|oʊ|ˈ|h|aɪ|d|r|eɪ|t}}) is a [[biomolecule]] consisting of [[carbon]] (C), [[hydrogen]] (H) and [[oxygen]] (O) atoms, usually with a hydrogen–oxygen [[atom]] ratio of 2:1 (as in water) and thus with the [[empirical formula]] {{nowrap|C&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (where ''m'' may be different from ''n''). This formula holds true for [[monosaccharide]]s. Some exceptions exist; for example, [[deoxyribose]], a sugar component of [[DNA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=itHVNZicPgwC&amp;pg=PT86&amp;lpg=PT86&amp;dq=C5H10O4+Deoxyribose | title =Biology | first1 = Eldra Pearl | last1 = Solomon | first2 = Linda R. | last2 = Berg | first3 = Diana W. | last3 = Martin | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | page = 52 | isbn = 978-0534278281 | via =google.books.com | year =2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; has the empirical formula C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/inchi/InChI%3D1S/C5H10O4/c6-2-1-4(8)5(9)3-7/h2,4-5,7-9H,1,3H2 | title =Material Measurement Library D-erythro-Pentose, 2-deoxy- | author =''[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]'' | publisher =nist.gov | year =2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbohydrates are technically [[hydrate]]s of carbon; structurally it is more accurate to view them as [[aldose]]s and [[ketose]]s.

The term is most common in [[biochemistry]], where it is a synonym of 'saccharide', a group that includes [[sugar]]s, [[starch]], and [[cellulose]]. The saccharides are divided into four chemical groups: monosaccharides, [[disaccharide]]s, [[oligosaccharide]]s, and [[polysaccharide]]s. Monosaccharides and disaccharides, the smallest (lower [[molecular weight]]) carbohydrates, are  commonly referred to as sugars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flitsch SL, Ulijn RV | title = Sugars tied to the spot | journal = Nature | volume = 421 | issue = 6920 | pages = 219–20 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12529622 | doi = 10.1038/421219a | bibcode = 2003Natur.421..219F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''saccharide'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''σάκχαρον'' (''sákkharon''), meaning "sugar".&lt;ref name="avenas"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Avenas P | year = 2012 | chapter = Etymology of main polysaccharide names | veditors = Navard P | title = The European Polysaccharide Network of Excellence (EPNOE) | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Wien | url = https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783709104200-c1.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1364512-p174060193 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex, the names of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix [[-ose]], as in the monosaccharides [[fructose]] (fruit sugar) and [[glucose]] (starch sugar) and the disaccharides [[sucrose]] ([[Sugar cane|cane]] or [[Sugar beet|beet]] sugar) and [[lactose]] (milk sugar).

Carbohydrates perform numerous roles in living organisms. Polysaccharides serve for the storage of [[energy]] (e.g. [[starch]] and [[glycogen]]) and as structural components (e.g. [[cellulose]] in plants and [[chitin]] in arthropods). The 5-carbon monosaccharide [[ribose]] is an important component of [[coenzyme]]s (e.g. [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]] and [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]) and the backbone of the genetic molecule known as [[RNA]]. The related [[deoxyribose]] is a component of DNA. Saccharides and their derivatives include many other important [[biomolecules]] that play key roles in the [[immune system]], [[fertilization]], preventing [[pathogenesis]], [[blood clotting]], and [[developmental biology|development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Maton | first1 = Anthea  | first2 = Jean | last2 = Hopkins | first3  = Charles William | last3 = McLaughlin | first4 = Susan | last4 = Johnson | first5 = Maryanna Quon | last5 = Warner | first6 = David | last6 = LaHart | first7 = Jill D. | last7 = Wright | name-list-format = vanc | title=Human Biology and Health|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1993|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|pages=52–59|isbn=0-13-981176-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starch and sugars are the most important carbohydrates in human diet. They are found in a wide variety of natural and processed foods. Starch is a polysaccharide. It is abundant in cereals (wheat, maize, rice), potatoes, and processed food based on cereal [[flour]], such as bread, pizza or pasta. Sugars appear in human diet mainly as table sugar (sucrose, extracted from [[sugarcane]] or [[sugar beet]]s), lactose (abundant in milk), glucose and fructose, both of which occur naturally in [[honey]], many fruits, and some vegetables. Table sugar, milk, or honey are often added to drinks and many prepared foods such as jam, biscuits and cakes.

Cellulose, a polysaccharide found in the cell walls of all plants, is one of the main components of insoluble [[dietary fiber]]. Although it is not digestible, insoluble dietary fiber helps to maintain a healthy digestive system&lt;ref&gt;USDA National Nutrient Database, 2015, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; by easing [[defecation]]. Other polysaccharides contained in dietary fiber include [[resistant starch]] and [[inulin]], which feed some bacteria in the [[microbiota]] of the [[large intestine]], and are [[metabolism|metabolized]] by these bacteria to yield [[short-chain fatty acids]].&lt;ref name="CRC Handbook of Dietary Fiber in Human Nutrition"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cummings|first1=John H.|title=The Effect of Dietary Fiber on Fecal Weight and Composition|date=2001| publisher=CRC Press| location=Boca Raton, Florida| isbn=0-8493-2387-8| pages=184| edition=3rd| url=https://www.crcpress.com/CRC-Handbook-of-Dietary-Fiber-in-Human-Nutrition-Third-Edition/Spiller/p/book/9780849323874}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Byrne CS, Chambers ES, Morrison DJ, Frost G | title = The role of short chain fatty acids in appetite regulation and energy homeostasis | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 39 | issue = 9 | pages = 1331–8 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 25971927 | pmc = 4564526 | doi = 10.1038/ijo.2015.84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
In scientific literature, the term "carbohydrate" has many synonyms, like "sugar" (in the broad sense), "saccharide", "ose",&lt;ref name="avenas"/&gt; "glucide",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Fearon WF | year = 1949 | title = Introduction to Biochemistry | edition = 2nd | location = London | publisher = Heinemann | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YkOaBQAAQBAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; "hydrate of carbon" or "[[Hydroxy group|polyhydroxy]] compounds with [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]]". Some of these terms, specially "carbohydrate" and "sugar", are also used with other meanings.

In [[food science]] and in many informal contexts, the term "carbohydrate" often means any food that is particularly rich in the complex carbohydrate [[starch]] (such as cereals, bread and pasta) or simple carbohydrates, such as sugar (found in candy, [[jam]]s, and desserts).

Often in lists of [[nutritional information]], such as the [[USDA National Nutrient Database]], the term "carbohydrate" (or "carbohydrate by difference") is used for everything other than water, protein, fat, ash, and ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;USDA National Nutrient Database, 2015, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; This includes chemical compounds such as [[acetic acid|acetic]] or [[lactic acid]], which are not normally considered carbohydrates. It also includes [[dietary fiber]] which is a carbohydrate but which does not contribute much in the way of [[food energy]] ([[Calorie|kilocalories]]), even though it is often included in the calculation of total food energy just as though it were a sugar.

In the strict sense, "[[sugar]]" is applied for sweet, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food.

== Structure ==
Formerly the name "carbohydrate" was used in [[chemistry]] for any compound with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Following this definition, some chemists considered [[formaldehyde]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) to be the simplest carbohydrate,&lt;ref name="coulter"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = John Merle | last1 = Coulter | first2 = Charler Reid | last2 = Barnes | first3 = Henry Chandler | last3 = Cowles | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1930 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WyZnVpCiTHIC&amp;pg=PA375&amp;dq=simplest+carbohydrate | title = A Textbook of Botany for Colleges and Universities }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others claimed that title for [[glycolaldehyde]].&lt;ref name="tietz"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Carl A. | last1 = Burtis | first2 = Edward R. | last2 = Ashwood | first3 = Norbert W. | last3 = Tietz | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2000 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l5hqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=simplest+carbohydrate | title = Tietz fundamentals of clinical chemistry }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the term is generally understood in the biochemistry sense, which excludes compounds with only one or two carbons and includes many biological carbohydrates which deviate from this formula. For example, while the above representative formulas would seem to capture the commonly known carbohydrates, ubiquitous and abundant carbohydrates often deviate from this. For example, carbohydrates often display chemical groups such as: ''N''-acetyl (e.g. chitin), sulphate (e.g. glycosaminoglycans), carboxylic acid (e.g. sialic acid) and deoxy modifications (e.g. fucose and sialic acid).

Natural saccharides are generally built of simple carbohydrates called [[monosaccharide]]s with general formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; where ''n'' is three or more. A typical monosaccharide has the structure H–(CHOH)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(C=O)–(CHOH)&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;–H, that is, an [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]] with many [[hydroxyl]] groups added, usually one on each [[carbon]] [[atom]] that is not part of the aldehyde or ketone [[functional group]]. Examples of monosaccharides are [[glucose]], [[fructose]], and [[glyceraldehyde]]s. However, some biological substances commonly called "monosaccharides" do not conform to this formula (e.g. [[uronic acid]]s and deoxy-sugars such as [[fucose]]) and there are many chemicals that do conform to this formula but are not considered to be monosaccharides (e.g. formaldehyde CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and [[inositol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Matthews CE, Van Holde KE, Ahern KG | year = 1999 | title = Biochemistry | edition = 3rd | publisher = Benjamin Cummings | isbn = 0-8053-3066-6 }}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[open-chain]] form of a monosaccharide often coexists with a [[heterocyclic compound|closed ring form]] where the [[aldehyde]]/[[ketone]] [[carbonyl]] group carbon (C=O) and hydroxyl group (–OH) react forming a [[hemiacetal]] with a new C–O–C bridge.

Monosaccharides can be linked together into what are called [[polysaccharide]]s (or [[oligosaccharide]]s) in a large variety of ways. Many carbohydrates contain one or more modified monosaccharide units that have had one or more groups replaced or removed. For example, [[deoxyribose]], a component of [[DNA]], is a modified version of [[ribose]]; [[chitin]] is composed of repeating units of [[N-acetyl glucosamine]], a [[nitrogen]]-containing form of glucose.

==Division==
Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, acids, their simple derivatives and their polymers having linkages of the acetal type. They may be classified according to their degree of polymerization, and may be divided initially into three principal groups, namely sugars, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Carbohydrates in human nutrition | series = FAO Food and Nutrition Paper - 66 | chapter = Chapter 1 – The role of carbohydrates in nutrition | url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/w8079e/w8079e07.htm | publisher =Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monosaccharides==
{{Main|Monosaccharide}}
[[Image:D-glucose color coded.png|130px|right|thumb|[[Glucose|D-glucose]] is an aldohexose with the formula (C·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The red atoms highlight the [[aldehyde]] group and the blue atoms highlight the [[chirality (chemistry)|asymmetric center]] furthest from the aldehyde; because this -OH is on the right of the [[Fischer projection]], this is a D sugar.]]
Monosaccharides are the simplest carbohydrates in that they cannot be [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] to smaller carbohydrates. They are aldehydes or ketones with two or more hydroxyl groups. The general [[chemical formula]] of an unmodified monosaccharide is (C•H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, literally a "carbon hydrate". Monosaccharides are important fuel molecules as well as building blocks for nucleic acids. The smallest monosaccharides, for which n=3, are dihydroxyacetone and D- and L-glyceraldehydes.

Note the position of the hydroxyl group (red or green) on the anomeric carbon relative to the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH group bound to carbon 5: they either have identical absolute configurations (R,R or S,S) (α), or opposite absolute configurations (R,S or S,R) (β).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1955/#_ch2_s4_ | chapter = Structural Basis of Glycan Diversity | title = Essentials of Glycobiology | edition = 3rd | publisher =  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press | location = Cold Spring Harbor (NY) | first1 = Carolyn R | last1 = Bertozzi | first2 = David | last2 = Rabuka | name-list-format = vanc | isbn = 978-1-621821-32-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Monosaccharides are classified according to three different characteristics: the placement of its [[carbonyl]] group, the number of [[carbon]] atoms it contains, and its [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] handedness. If the carbonyl group is an [[aldehyde]], the monosaccharide is an [[aldose]]; if the carbonyl group is a [[ketone]], the monosaccharide is a [[ketose]]. Monosaccharides with three carbon atoms are called [[triose]]s, those with four are called [[tetrose]]s, five are called [[pentose]]s, six are [[hexose]]s, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Neil A.| first2 = Brad | last2 = Williamson | first3 = Robin J. | last3 = Heyden | name-list-format = vanc | title = Biology: Exploring Life|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|year=2006|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=|url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html|isbn=0-13-250882-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two systems of classification are often combined. For example, [[glucose]] is an [[aldohexose]] (a six-carbon aldehyde), [[ribose]] is an [[aldopentose]] (a five-carbon aldehyde), and [[fructose]] is a [[ketohexose]] (a six-carbon ketone).

Each carbon atom bearing a [[hydroxyl group]] (-OH), with the exception of the first and last carbons, are [[Chirality (chemistry)|asymmetric]], making them [[Stereogenic|stereo center]]s with two possible configurations each (R or S). Because of this asymmetry, a number of [[isomer]]s may exist for any given monosaccharide formula. Using [[Le Bel-van't Hoff rule]], the aldohexose D-glucose, for example, has the formula (C·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, of which four of its six carbons atoms are stereogenic, making D-glucose one of 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;=16 possible [[stereoisomer]]s. In the case of [[glyceraldehyde]]s, an aldotriose, there is one pair of possible stereoisomers, which are [[enantiomers]] and [[epimer]]s. [[Dihydroxyacetone|1, 3-dihydroxyacetone]], the ketose corresponding to the aldose glyceraldehydes, is a symmetric molecule with no stereo centers. The assignment of D or L is made according to the orientation of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the carbonyl group: in a standard Fischer projection if the hydroxyl group is on the right the molecule is a D sugar, otherwise it is an L sugar. The "D-" and "L-" prefixes should not be confused with "d-" or "l-", which indicate the direction that the sugar  [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotates]] plane [[Polarization (waves)|polarized light]]. This usage of "d-" and "l-" is no longer followed in carbohydrate chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Pigman | first1 = Ward | last2 = Horton | first2 = D. | name-list-format = vanc | title=The Carbohydrates: Chemistry and Biochemistry Vol 1A|editor=Pigman and Horton|edition=2nd|year=1972|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages=1–67|chapter=Chapter 1: Stereochemistry of the Monosaccharides}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ring-straight chain isomerism===
[[Image:Glucose Fisher to Haworth.gif|thumb|200px|right|[[Glucose]] can exist in both a straight-chain and ring form.]]
The aldehyde or ketone group of a straight-chain monosaccharide will react reversibly with a hydroxyl group on a different carbon atom to form a [[hemiacetal]] or [[hemiketal]], forming a [[heterocyclic]] ring with an oxygen bridge between two carbon atoms. Rings with five and six atoms are called [[furanose]] and [[pyranose]] forms, respectively, and exist in equilibrium with the straight-chain form.&lt;ref name=pigman&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Pigman | first1 = Ward | last2 = Anet | first2 = E.F.L.J. | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Carbohydrates: Chemistry and Biochemistry Vol 1A|editor=Pigman and Horton|edition=2nd|year=1972|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages=165–94|chapter=Chapter 4: Mutarotations and Actions of Acids and Bases}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the conversion from straight-chain form to the cyclic form, the carbon atom containing the carbonyl oxygen, called the [[anomeric carbon]], becomes a stereogenic center with two possible configurations: The oxygen atom may take a position either above or below the plane of the ring. The resulting possible pair of stereoisomers is called [[anomer]]s. In the ''α anomer'', the -OH substituent on the anomeric carbon rests on the opposite side ([[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]) of the ring from the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH side branch. The alternative form, in which the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH substituent and the anomeric hydroxyl are on the same side (cis) of the plane of the ring, is called the ''β anomer''.

===Use in living organisms===
Monosaccharides are the major source of fuel for [[metabolism]], being used both as an energy source ([[glucose]] being the most important in nature) and in [[biosynthesis]]. When monosaccharides are not immediately needed by many cells they are often converted to more space-efficient forms, often [[polysaccharide]]s. In many animals, including humans, this storage form is [[glycogen]], especially in liver and muscle cells. In plants, [[starch]] is used for the same purpose. The most abundant carbohydrate, [[cellulose]], is a structural component of the [[cell wall#plant cell walls|cell wall]] of plants and many forms of algae. [[Ribose]] is a component of [[RNA]]. [[Deoxyribose]] is a component of [[DNA]]. [[Lyxose]] is a component of lyxoflavin found in the human heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=lyxoflavin|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/lyxoflavin|publisher=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ribulose]] and [[xylulose]] occur in the [[pentose phosphate pathway]]. [[Galactose]], a component of milk sugar [[lactose]], is found in [[galactolipid]]s in [[cell membrane#lipids|plant cell membranes]] and in [[glycoprotein]]s in many [[biological tissue|tissues]]. [[Mannose]] occurs in human metabolism, especially in the [[glycosylation]] of certain proteins. [[Fructose]], or fruit sugar, is found in many plants and in humans, it is metabolized in the liver, absorbed directly into the intestines during [[digestion]], and found in [[semen]]. [[Trehalose]], a major sugar of insects, is rapidly hydrolyzed into two glucose molecules to support continuous flight.

==Disaccharides==
[[Image:sucrose 3Dprojection.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Sucrose]], also known as table sugar, is a common disaccharide. It is composed of two monosaccharides: [[glucose|D-glucose]] (left) and [[fructose|D-fructose]] (right).]]
{{Main|Disaccharide}}
Two joined monosaccharides are called a [[disaccharide]] and these are the simplest polysaccharides. Examples include [[sucrose]] and [[lactose]]. They are composed of two monosaccharide units bound together by a [[covalent]] bond known as a [[glycosidic linkage]] formed via a [[dehydration reaction]], resulting in the loss of a [[hydrogen]] atom from one monosaccharide and a [[hydroxyl group]] from the other. The [[chemical formula|formula]] of unmodified disaccharides is C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;. Although there are numerous kinds of disaccharides, a handful of disaccharides are particularly notable.

[[Sucrose]], pictured to the right, is the most abundant disaccharide, and the main form in which carbohydrates are transported in plants. It is composed of one [[glucose|D-glucose]] molecule and one [[fructose|D-fructose]] molecule. The [[systematic name]] for sucrose, ''O''-α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-D-fructofuranoside, indicates four things:
* Its monosaccharides: glucose and fructose
* Their ring types: glucose is a [[pyranose]] and fructose is a [[furanose]]
* How they are linked together: the oxygen on carbon number 1 (C1) of α-D-glucose is linked to the C2 of D-fructose.
* The ''-oside'' suffix indicates that the [[anomeric carbon]] of both monosaccharides participates in the glycosidic bond.

[[Lactose]], a disaccharide composed of one [[galactose|D-galactose]] molecule and one [[glucose|D-glucose]] molecule, occurs naturally in mammalian milk. The [[systematic name]] for lactose is ''O''-β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucopyranose. Other notable disaccharides include [[maltose]] (two D-glucoses linked α-1,4) and cellulobiose (two D-glucoses linked β-1,4). Disaccharides can be classified into two types: reducing and non-reducing disaccharides. If the functional group is present in bonding with another sugar unit, it is called a reducing disaccharide or biose.

==Nutrition==
{{undue weight|date=June 2015}}
[[Image:Wheat products.jpg|thumb|[[cereal|Grain]] products: rich sources of carbohydrates]]

Carbohydrate consumed in food yields 3.87 kilocalories of energy per [[gram]] for simple sugars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/6202|title=Show Foods|work=usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3.57 to 4.12 kilocalories per gram for complex carbohydrate in most other foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5022e/y5022e04.htm|title=Calculation of the Energy Content of Foods – Energy Conversion Factors|work=fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatively high levels of carbohydrate are associated with processed foods or refined foods made from plants, including sweets, cookies and candy, table sugar, honey, soft drinks, breads and crackers, jams and fruit products, pastas and breakfast cereals. Lower amounts of carbohydrate are usually associated with unrefined foods, including beans, tubers, rice, and unrefined fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.diabetes.org.uk/upload/How%20we%20help/catalogue/carb-reference-list-0511.pdf |title=Carbohydrate reference list |website=www.diabetes.org.uk |date=  |access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal-based foods generally have the lowest carbohydrate levels, although milk does contain a high proportion of [[lactose]].

Organisms typically cannot metabolize all types of carbohydrate to yield energy. Glucose is a nearly universal and accessible source of energy. Many organisms also have the ability to metabolize other [[monosaccharide]]s and [[disaccharide]]s but glucose is often metabolized first. In ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', for example, the [[lac operon]] will express enzymes for the digestion of lactose when it is present, but if both lactose and glucose are present the ''lac'' operon is repressed, resulting in the glucose being used first (see: [[Diauxie]]). [[Polysaccharide]]s are also common sources of energy. Many organisms can easily break down starches into glucose; most organisms, however, cannot metabolize [[cellulose]] or other polysaccharides like [[chitin]] and [[arabinoxylans]]. These carbohydrate types can be metabolized by some bacteria and protists. [[Ruminant]]s and [[termite]]s, for example, use microorganisms to process cellulose. Even though these complex carbohydrates are not very digestible, they represent an important dietary element for humans, called [[dietary fiber]]. Fiber enhances digestion, among other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pichon L, Huneau JF, Fromentin G, Tomé D | title = A high-protein, high-fat, carbohydrate-free diet reduces energy intake, hepatic lipogenesis, and adiposity in rats | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 136 | issue = 5 | pages = 1256–60 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16614413 | doi = 10.1093/jn/136.5.1256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===&lt;!-- This title is used as a redirect target --&gt;
[[Nutrition]]ists often refer to carbohydrates as either simple or complex. However, the exact distinction between these groups can be ambiguous. The term ''complex carbohydrate'' was first used in the [[U.S. Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs]] publication ''Dietary Goals for the United States'' (1977) where it was intended to distinguish sugars from other carbohydrates (which were perceived to be nutritionally superior).&lt;ref&gt;Joint WHO/FAO expert consultation (1998), ''Carbohydrates in human nutrition'', [http://www.fao.org/docrep/W8079E/w8079e07.htm chapter 1]. {{ISBN|92-5-104114-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the report put "fruit, vegetables and whole-grains" in the complex carbohydrate column, despite the fact that these may contain sugars as well as polysaccharides. This confusion persists as today some nutritionists use the term complex carbohydrate to refer to any sort of digestible saccharide present in a whole food, where fiber, vitamins and minerals are also found (as opposed to processed carbohydrates, which provide energy but few other nutrients). The standard usage, however, is to classify carbohydrates chemically: simple if they are sugars ([[monosaccharide]]s and [[disaccharide]]s) and complex if they are [[polysaccharide]]s (or [[oligosaccharide]]s).&lt;ref name=NutSource&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbohydrates|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/carbohydrates/|work=The Nutrition Source|publisher=Harvard School of Public Health|access-date=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, the simple vs. complex chemical distinction has little value for determining the nutritional quality of carbohydrates.&lt;ref name=NutSource /&gt; Some simple carbohydrates (e.g. [[fructose]]) raise blood glucose slowly, while some complex carbohydrates (starches), especially if processed, raise blood sugar rapidly. The speed of digestion is determined by a variety of factors including which other nutrients are consumed with the carbohydrate, how the food is prepared, individual differences in metabolism, and the chemistry of the carbohydrate.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jenkins DJ, Jenkins AL, Wolever TM, Thompson LH, Rao AV | title = Simple and complex carbohydrates | journal = Nutrition Reviews | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 44–9 | date = February 1986 | pmid = 3703387 | doi = 10.1111/j.1753-4887.1986.tb07585.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA's]] ''Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010'' call for moderate- to high-carbohydrate consumption from a balanced diet that includes six one-ounce servings of grain foods each day, at least half from [[whole grain]] sources and the rest from [[Enriched grain|enriched]].&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Health and Human Services|DHHS]] and [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], [http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/DietaryGuidelines.htm ''Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010''].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[glycemic index|glycemic index (GI)]] and [[glycemic load]] concepts have been developed to characterize food behavior during human digestion. They rank carbohydrate-rich foods based on the rapidity and magnitude of their effect on [[blood glucose]] levels. Glycemic index is a measure of how quickly food [[glucose]] is absorbed, while glycemic load is a measure of the total absorbable glucose in foods. The [[insulin index]] is a similar, more recent classification method that ranks foods based on their effects on [[insulin|blood insulin]] levels, which are caused by glucose (or starch) and some amino acids in food.

=== Effects of dietary carbohydrate restriction ===

{{See also|Low-carbohydrate diet}}

Carbohydrates are a common source of energy in living organisms; however, no single carbohydrate is an [[essential nutrient]] in humans.&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Westman EC | title = Is dietary carbohydrate essential for human nutrition? | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 75 | issue = 5 | pages = 951–3; author reply 953-4 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 11976176 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/75.5.951a }}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are able to obtain all of their energy requirement from protein and fats, though the potential for some negative health effects of extreme carbohydrate restriction remains, as the issue has not been studied extensively yet.&lt;ref name="r1" /&gt; However, in the case of [[dietary fiber]]&amp;nbsp;– indigestible carbohydrates which are not a source of energy&amp;nbsp;– inadequate intake can lead to significant increases in mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Park Y, Subar AF, Hollenbeck A, Schatzkin A | title = Dietary fiber intake and mortality in the NIH-AARP diet and health study | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 171 | issue = 12 | pages = 1061–8 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21321288 | pmc = 3513325 | doi = 10.1001/archinternmed.2011.18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16685046"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnston CS, Tjonn SL, Swan PD, White A, Hutchins H, Sears B | title = Ketogenic low-carbohydrate diets have no metabolic advantage over nonketogenic low-carbohydrate diets | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 83 | issue = 5 | pages = 1055–61 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16685046 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/83.5.1055 | url = http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/83/5/1055.full.pdf+html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a diet consisting of very low amounts of daily carbohydrate for several days will usually result in higher levels of blood [[ketone bodies]] than an isocaloric diet with similar protein content. This relatively high level of ketone bodies is commonly known as [[ketosis]] and is very often confused with the potentially fatal condition often seen in [[Type 1 diabeties|type 1 diabetics]] known as diabetic [[ketoacidosis]]. Somebody suffering ketoacidosis will have much higher levels of blood ketone bodies along with high blood sugar, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the [[blood–brain barrier]], but the liver can break these down to produce ketones. However, the medium-chain fatty acids octanoic and heptanoic acids can cross the barrier and be used by the brain, which normally relies upon glucose for its energy.&lt;ref name="Ebert_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebert D, Haller RG, Walton ME | title = Energy contribution of octanoate to intact rat brain metabolism measured by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 23 | issue = 13 | pages = 5928–35 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12843297 | doi =  | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/content/23/13/5928.full }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marin-Valencia I, Good LB, Ma Q, Malloy CR, Pascual JM | title = Heptanoate as a neural fuel: energetic and neurotransmitter precursors in normal and glucose transporter I-deficient (G1D) brain | journal = Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 175–82 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23072752 | pmc = 3564188 | doi = 10.1038/jcbfm.2012.151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.medbio.info/Horn/IntMet/integration_of_metabolism%20v4.htm | title=Integration of Metabolism|work=medbio.info | first = Robert S. | last = Horn | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gluconeogenesis]] allows humans to synthesize some glucose from specific amino acids: from the [[glycerol]] backbone in [[triglyceride]]s and in some cases from fatty acids.

==Metabolism==
{{Main|Carbohydrate metabolism}}
Carbohydrate metabolism denotes the various [[biochemistry|biochemical]] processes responsible for the [[anabolism|formation]], [[catabolism|breakdown]] and interconversion of carbohydrates in [[life|living]] [[organism]]s.

The most important carbohydrate is [[glucose]], a simple sugar ([[monosaccharide]]) that is metabolized by nearly all known organisms. Glucose and other carbohydrates are part of a wide variety of metabolic pathways across species: [[plants]] synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water by [[photosynthesis]] storing the absorbed energy internally, often in the form of [[starch]] or [[lipid]]s. Plant components are consumed by animals and [[fungi]], and used as fuel for [[cellular respiration]]. Oxidation of one gram of carbohydrate yields approximately 9&amp;nbsp;kJ (4&amp;nbsp;kcal) of [[Chemical energy|energy]], while the oxidation of one gram of lipids yields about 38&amp;nbsp;kJ (9&amp;nbsp;kcal). The human body stores between 300 to 500&amp;nbsp;g of carbohydrates depending on body weight, with the skeletal muscle contributing to a large portion of the storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onesearch.cuny.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=TN_sciversesciencedirect_elsevierS0263-9319(13)00087-2&amp;context=PC&amp;vid=hc&amp;search_scope=everything&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US|title=Surgery Oxford|last=Maughan|first=Ron|date=June 2013|website=www.onesearch.cuny.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy obtained from metabolism (e.g., oxidation of glucose) is usually stored temporarily within cells in the form of [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name="energetics"&gt;{{cite web | title = Energetics of Cellular Respiration (Glucose Metabolism) | first = Sweety | last = Mehta | name-list-format = vanc | work = Biochemistry Notes, Notes | date = 9 October 2013 | url = http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/10/energetics-of-cellular-respiration-glucose-metabolism/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms capable of anaerobic and [[aerobic respiration]] that metabolizes glucose and [[oxygen]] (aerobic) to release energy with [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]] as byproducts.

===Catabolism===
Catabolism is the metabolic reaction which cells undergo to break down larger molecules, extracting energy. There are two major [[metabolic pathway]]s of monosaccharide [[catabolism]]: [[glycolysis]] and the [[citric acid cycle]].

In glycolysis, oligo- and polysaccharides are cleaved first to smaller monosaccharides by enzymes called [[glycoside hydrolase]]s. The monosaccharide units can then enter into monosaccharide catabolism. A 2&amp;nbsp;ATP investment is required in the early steps of glycolysis to phosphorylate Glucose to [[Glucose 6-phosphate|Glucose 6-Phosphate]] ([[Glucose 6-phosphate|G6P]]) and [[Fructose 6-phosphate|Fructose 6-Phosphate]] ([[Fructose 6-phosphate|F6P]]) to [[Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate|Fructose 1,6-biphosphate]] ([[Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate|FBP]]), thereby pushing the reaction forward irreversibly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onesearch.cuny.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=TN_sciversesciencedirect_elsevierS0263-9319(13)00087-2&amp;context=PC&amp;vid=hc&amp;search_scope=everything&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US|title=Surgery Oxford|last=Maughan|first=Ron|date=June 2013|website=www.onesearch.cuny.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, as with humans, not all carbohydrate types are usable as the digestive and metabolic enzymes necessary are not present.

==Carbohydrate chemistry==
[[Carbohydrate chemistry]] is a large and economically important branch of organic chemistry. Some of the main [[organic reaction]]s that involve carbohydrates are:
* [[Carbohydrate acetalisation]]
* [[Cyanohydrin reaction]]
* [[Lobry de Bruyn–van Ekenstein transformation]]
* [[Amadori rearrangement]]
* [[Nef reaction]]
* [[Wohl degradation]]
* [[Koenigs–Knorr reaction]]
* [[Carbohydrate digestion]]

'''Continuity of Care Record''' ('''CCR''')&lt;ref name=E2369&gt;{{cite techreport |title=Standard Specification for Continuity of Care Record (CCR) |number=ASTM E2369 - 12 |type=Active standard |institution=ASTM International |date=2012 |url=https://www.astm.org/Standards/E2369.htm |doi=10.1520/E2369-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Medical record|health record]] standard specification developed jointly by [[ASTM International]], the [[Massachusetts Medical Society]] (MMS), the [[Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society]] (HIMSS), the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] (AAFP), the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP), and other health informatics vendors.&lt;ref name=E2369/&gt;

==Background and scope==
The CCR was generated by health care practitioners based on their views of the data they may want to share in any given situation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Jeffrey M.|last1=Ferranti|first2=R. Clayton|last2=Musser|first3=Kensaku|last3=Kawamoto|first4=W. Ed|last4=Hammond|title=The Clinical Document Architecture and the Continuity of Care Record: A Critical Analysis|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|date=May–June 2006|volume=13|issue=3|pages=245–252|doi=10.1197/jamia.M1963|doi-access=free|pmid=16501180|pmc=1513652}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2013}} The CCR document is used to allow timely and focused transmission of information to other health professionals involved in the patient's care.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The CCR aims to increase the role of the patient in managing their health and reduce error while improving continuity of patient care.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kibbe |first1=David C. |last2=Phillips |first2=Robert L., Jr. |last3=Green |first3=Larry A. |date=1 October 2004 |title=The Continuity of Care Record |journal=American Family Physician |volume=70 |issue=7 |pages=1. 220, 1222-3 |department=Editorial |pmid=15508532 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2004/1001/p1220.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCR standard is a patient health summary standard. It is a way to create flexible documents that contain the most relevant and timely core health information about a patient, and to send these electronically from one caregiver to another. The CCR's intent is also to create a standard of health information transportability when a patient is transferred or referred, or is seen by another healthcare professional.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite report |publisher=[[ASTM International|American Society for Testing and Materials]] |date=2013 |title=Continuity of Care Record:The Concept Paper of the CCR }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
The CCR is a unique development effort via a syndicate of the following sponsors:

* [[ASTM International]]
* [[Massachusetts Medical Society]]
* [[HIMSS]]
* [[American Academy of Family Physicians]]
* [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]
* [[American Medical Association]]
* Patient Safety Institute
* [[American Health Care Association]]
* National Association for the Support of [[Long-term care|LTC]]

==Content==
The CCR data set contains a summary of the patient's health status including problems, medications, allergies, and basic information about health insurance, care documentation, and the patient's care plan.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; These represent a "snapshot" of a patient's health data that can be useful or possibly lifesaving, if available at the time of clinical encounter.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The ASTM CCR standard's purpose is to permit easy creation by a physician using an [[electronic health record]] (EHR) system at the end of an encounter.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
More specifically within the CCR, there are mandated core elements in 6 sections.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These 6 sections are:

# Header
# Patient Identifying Information
# Patient Financial and Insurance Information
# Health Status of the Patient
# Care Documentation
# Care Plan Recommendation

==CCR standard and structure==
Because it is expressed in the standard data interchange language known as [[XML]], a CCR can potentially be created, read, and interpreted by any EHR or EMR software application. A CCR can also be exported to other formats, such as [[PDF]] or [[Office Open XML]] (Microsoft Word 2007 format).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The [[Continuity of Care Document]] (CCD) is an HL7 [[Clinical Document Architecture|CDA]] implementation of the Continuity of Care Record (CCR). A CCR document can generally be converted into CCD using Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations ([[XSLT]]), but it is not always possible to perform the inverse transformation, since some CCD features are not supported in CCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Fred |last1=Trotter |first2=David |last2=Uhlman |date=2011 |chapter=Chapter 10. Interoperability |chapter-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914043045/http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781449305024/meaningful_use_interoperability.html |title=Getting to Meaningful Use and Beyond |publisher=O'Reilly Media |isbn=978-1-4493-0502-4 |url=http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781449305024/index.html |archive-date=3 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903031803/http://ofps.oreilly.com:80/titles/9781449305024/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HITSP]] provides reference information that demonstrates how CCD and CCR  (as [[HITSP C32]]) are embedded in CDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=December 2009 |title=HITSP 09 N 451 – Comparison of CCR/CCD, CDA Documents and HITSP Products |website=ANSI Public Document Library |url=http://publicaa.ansi.org/sites/apdl/hitspadmin/Matrices/HITSP_09_N_451.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001055244/http://publicaa.ansi.org/sites/apdl/hitspadmin/Matrices/HITSP_09_N_451.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the CCR and CCD standards could continue to coexist, with CCR providing for basic information requests and CCD servicing more detailed requests, the newer CCD standard might eventually completely supplant CCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David C. |last=Kibbe |date=19 June 2008 |url=http://e-caremanagement.com/untangling-the-electronic-health-data-exchange/|title=Untangling the Electronic Health Data Exchange|website=e-CareManagement Blog |publisher=Better Health Technologies, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
As mentioned, the CCR standard uses [[Extensible Markup Language|eXtensible Markup Language]] (XML) as it is aimed at being technology neutral to allow for maximum applicability.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; This specified [[XML]] coding provides flexibility that will allow users to formulate, transfer, and view the CCR in a number of ways, for example, in a browser, in a Health Level 7 (HL7) message, in a secure email, as a [[PDF]] file, as an [[HTML]] file, or as a word document. This is aimed at producing flexible expression of structured data in avenues such as [[electronic health record]] (EHR) systems.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web |first=David C. |last=Kibbe |date=10 August 2006 |title=An Overview of the ASTM Continuity of Care Record (CCR) |website=NCHICA |publisher=North Carolina Healthcare Information and Communications Alliance, Inc. |url=http://www.nchica.org/Past/06/presentations/Kibbe.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114220532/http://www.nchica.org/Past/06/presentations/Kibbe.pdf |archivedate=2013-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the CCR's transportability, secure carriage and transmission of the electronic file can occur via physical
transport media, for example on a USB thumb drive, tablet or phone, CD ROM, or smart card, and in an electronic sense, secure transmission can occur via a network line, or the Internet.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

According to a personal injury law firm in Baltimore, MD, one of many representing class action plaintiffs, 1,400 families in the class action alleged abuse. Bradley was ultimately found guilty on all charges and was sentenced to 14 consecutive terms of [[life imprisonment|life]] plus 165 years in prison without parole on June 26, 2011. His conviction was affirmed by the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] on September 6, 2012.&lt;ref name=SupremeCourt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://courts.delaware.gov/opinions/download.aspx?ID=178080|title=Delaware Supreme Court, ''Bradley v. State'', Del. Supr., No. 467, 2011 |date=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of his arrest, it emerged that he had faced accusations of child abuse as early as 1995 in both Delaware and [[Pennsylvania]].

==Life and reputation==
Bradley was born and raised in [[Philadelphia]]. He graduated from the [[Temple University]] School of Medicine in 1983 and completed his pediatrics residency at [[Thomas Jefferson University Hospital]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vitals.com/doctors/Dr_Earl_Bradley.html |title=Dr. Earl Bradley, Pediatrician - Doctor in Lewes, DE - Pediatrics |publisher=Vitals.com |date=2010-02-22 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1984, he began working at [[Frankford, Philadelphia|Frankford]]-[[Torresdale, Philadelphia|Torresdale]] hospital on Knights Road in Northeast Philadelphia. He opened his own practice in a small complex just a few blocks away, at Academy and Red Lion Roads in Morrell Park.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbs3.com/local/Dr.Earl.Bradley.2.1390288.html |title=Dr. Earl Bradley, Charged With Raping, Sexually Abusing Young Patients Has Ties To Philadelphia |publisher=cbs3.com |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228220515/http://cbs3.com/local/Dr.Earl.Bradley.2.1390288.html |archivedate=December 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to work at Jefferson until a sudden move to Lewes on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="winnipegsun1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/news/world/2010/01/10/12408501-sun.html |title='System failed' with pedo doc |publisher=Winnipeg Sun |date=2010-01-10 |accessdate=2010-05-18}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was abrupt and poorly planned, with many patients complaining that they were not even notified that appointments had been cancelled.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In Lewes, Bradley was widely regarded as eccentric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=9520897 |title=Warnings About Accused Del. Pediatrician Surface |publisher=ABC News |date=2010-01-09 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His practice, '''BayBees Pediatrics''', had patients from nearby resort communities and area farming communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Barrish |first=Cris |url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20100110/NEWS01/105250005/?nclick_check=1 |title=Many missed alleged horrors |work=Delaware Online |date=January 10, 2010 |accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical offices, located near Lewes in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.delawareonline.com/assets/pdf/BL163213827.PDF |title=Superior Court of the State of Delware: Sussex County Search Warrant |work=Delaware Online |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6M7GxOjlw?url=http://www.delawareonline.com/assets/pdf/BL163213827.PDF |archivedate=December 24, 2013 |quote=18259 Coastal Highway Lewes, DE 19958 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; were ostentatiously decorated with carnival rides and other child-friendly decorations, such as a giant statue of [[Buzz Lightyear]] from [[Disney]]'s ''[[Toy Story]]'' and a small movie theatre showing Disney movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wboc.com/global/story.asp?s=11882094 |title=Mother Tells Authorities to Remove Toys from Bradley's Property |publisher=WBOC-TV 16 |date=2010-02-16 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He owned several vehicles which were painted yellow and black with eyes and a tail to resemble bumblebees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20100218/NEWS01/2180333 |title=Delaware crime: Dr. Earl Bradley's property cleaned up |accessdate=March 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221083016/http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20100218/NEWS01/2180333 |archivedate=February 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oddities extended to his home, where he prominently displayed a full suit of medieval armor on his porch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dennisforney.wordpress.com/2009/12/21/the-inscrutable-monstrous-dr-bradley/ |title=The inscrutable, monstrous Dr. Bradley |first=Dennis |last=Forney |work=Barefootin' |date=2009-12-21 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of child abuse==
The first known allegations of inappropriate conduct by Bradley came in 1994, when Thomas Jefferson University Hospital investigated a patient's complaint of sexual misconduct.&lt;ref name="capegazette1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ritter |first=Laura |url=http://www.capegazette.com/storiescurrent/200912/bradley-pa22.html |title=Bradley accused of misconduct in Pennsylvania |publisher=Cape Gazette |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a second allegation in 1995.&lt;ref name="drphil1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drphil.com/slideshows/slideshow/5663/?id=5663&amp;slide=2&amp;showID=1423&amp;preview=&amp;versionID= |title=Delaware Doctor |publisher=Dr. Phil.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital could not verify the claim, and records remain sealed.&lt;ref name="capegazette1"/&gt; Bradley promptly closed his fledgling private practice and relocated with his children to Lewes, where he took a job with [[Beebe Healthcare|Beebe Medical Center]].&lt;ref name="winnipegsun1"/&gt;

In 2004, Bradley's sister Lynda Barnes, who had served as an office manager at his medical office, alerted the state medical society that parents had complained to her about inappropriate touching by Bradley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmdt.com/news-archive.aspx?item=4800 |title=::. WMDT 47 News Delmarvas Choice .:: |publisher=Wmdt.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-18}} {{dead link|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes also reported that Bradley physically and emotionally abused his own son, and stole prescription [[antidepressants]] from the office.&lt;ref name="capegazette2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mavity |first=Ryan |url=http://www.capegazette.com/storiescurrent/201001/bradley-milford08.html |title=Milford police investigated Bradley in 2005 |publisher=Cape Gazette |date=2010-01-07 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations were made again in 2005. Police records show that a nurse reported that he videotaped kids playing and other doctors reported complaints about long and unnecessary [[vagina]]l exams.&lt;ref name="drphil1"/&gt; When police in [[Milford, Delaware]], sought a [[warrant (law)|warrant]] to arrest him for inappropriately touching a child patient, the Attorney General's office concluded at the time that there was insufficient evidence to warrant prosecution.&lt;ref name="capegazette2"/&gt;

On December 16, 2009, following a year-long investigation and complaints of inappropriate touching by a two-year-old patient, Bradley was arrested and charged with nine counts, including a felony charge for a fourth degree rape of a two-year-old patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capegazette.com/article/lewes-doctor-released-bail/10583 |title=Lewes doctor released on bail |publisher=Cape Gazette |date=2009-12-18 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, relying on more than 13 hours of videotaped rapes and molestations discovered by police in Bradley's home and office, additional warrants were issued. These included felony warrants for several counts of child exploitation and first-degree rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capegazette.com/article/charges-mount-lewes-pediatrician-case/3747 |title=Charges mount in Lewes pediatrician case |publisher=Cape Gazette |date=2009-12-21 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest, indictment and fallout==
Bradley surrendered to authorities on December 18, 2009. His bail was set at $2.9 million cash, which was not posted. An initial preliminary hearing was delayed after prison officials placed Bradley on a [[suicide watch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://abcnews.go.com/WN/delaware-pediatrician-earl-bradley-accused-sexually-abusing-young/story?id=9418371 |title=Pediatrician Earl Bradley Accused of Raping Child Patients, Videotaping Acts |first=Emily |last=Friedman |work=ABC News |date=December 24, 2009  |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attorney, Eugene Maurer, denied that Bradley was suicidal but complained that prison officials had deprived him of his prescription glasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/delawareonline/access/1940238771.html?FMT=ABS&amp;date=Jan+15,+2010 |title=Doctor waives initial hearing |publisher=The News Journal: Archives |date=2010-01-15 |accessdate=2010-05-18 | first=Dan | last=Shortridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, a [[grand jury]] sitting for the [[Delaware Superior Court]] indicted Bradley on 471 charges, including counts of rape and exploitation. 103 victims were identified in the indictment, though the Attorney General indicated that they expected to identify even more victims.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; The indictment included allegations that Bradley had forced children as young as three months old to engage in intercourse and oral sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/doctor-in-us-to-go-on-trial-for-471-charges-of-child-rape-1908556.html |title=Doctor in US to go on trial for 471 charges of child rape |publisher=The Independent |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2010-05-18 | location=London | first=Lewis | last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also revealed that Bradley had videotaped sexual assaults during which his victims "appeared to lose consciousness" from Bradley choking them by forcing oral sex on his child victims. The videos also show children in diapers screaming as they attempted to escape from Bradley before he raped them in an outbuilding on the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2011/08/26/20110826delaware-pediatrician-sex-assaults-sentence.html |first=Cris |last=Barrish |title=Ex-pediatrician gets 14 life sentences in sex assaults |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=August 26, 2011 |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20100224/NEWS01/2240356 |title=Delaware crime: Dr. Earl Bradley sex case ignites outrage |publisher=The News Journal |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though his private lawyers quit after Delaware took steps to freeze his assets, Bradley was afforded a public defender and arraigned on March 24, 2010. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. A follow-up hearing was scheduled for May 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Carlin DeGuerin Miller |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20001198-504083.html |title=Alleged Predator Pediatrician, Earl Bradley, Pleads Not Guilty to 471 Counts of Sexual Abuse |publisher=CBS News |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Delaware Board of Medical Practice suspended Bradley's license permanently on February 19, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newarkpostonline.com/articles/2010/02/20/news/doc4b805ebeee4e3581333060.txt |title=Board revokes license of Dr. Earl Bradley |publisher=Newark Post |date=February 20, 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delaware governor [[Jack Markell]], concerned about failures in the medical, police and legal communities that allowed Bradley's crimes to continue for more than a decade, has called for an independent review. [[Widener University]] Law School Dean [[Linda Ammons]] was appointed to head up that review.

Delaware Attorney General [[Beau Biden]], son of [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] [[Joseph Biden|Joe Biden]], announced in a January 2010 speech that he would not seek election to his father's former seat in the [[United States Senate]] because he felt it was more important to fully pursue Bradley's prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Randall Chase |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/jan/25/beau-biden-vps-son-wont-seek-us-senate-seat/ |title=Beau Biden, VP's son, won't seek US Senate seat |publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com |date=2010-01-25 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradley's case was moved to [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] from [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]] because of concerns about getting an impartial jury in Sussex County, as many families of his 127 alleged victims lived there.  However, Bradley then waived his right to a jury trial, opting instead for a bench trial.  The case was then moved back to Sussex County.  After hearing evidence on June 7, 2011, Judge William C. Carpenter, the presiding Judge in Bradley's bench trial, stated he would issue his verdict at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/06/07/delaware.pediatrician.trial/index.html?hpt=ju_c2 | work=CNN | title=Delaware pediatrician goes on trial for alleged sex abuse | date=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 2011, Bradley was convicted on all 24 counts on a consolidated indictment (which originally contained 529 counts): 14 counts of rape, seven counts of assault, and three counts of sexual exploitation of a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20110623/NEWS/110623037/Dr-Earl-Bradley-found-guilty-raping-abusing-child-patients |title=Dr. Earl Bradley found guilty of raping, abusing child patients |publisher=The News Journal |date=June 23, 2011 |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 2011, Judge Carpenter sentenced Bradley to the maximum sentence of 14 consecutive terms of life in prison plus a further 165 years in prison without parole. Under Delaware law, anyone convicted of raping three separate persons automatically receives life without parole. Judge Carpenter said that Bradley "betrayed his patients' trust and disgraced the medical profession", and that "you will never be in a position to harm a child again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://news.yahoo.com/del-pediatrician-gets-life-abusing-patients-145713017.html |title=Del. pediatrician gets life for abusing patients |first=Randall |last=Chase |work=Yahoo News |date=August 26, 2011 |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradley appealed to the [[Delaware Supreme Court]], claiming that the original search warrant was not specific enough about where the evidence would be located, and that the police exceeded the limits of the warrant without probable cause.  The Delaware Supreme Court unanimously affirmed Bradley's convictions on September 6, 2012.&lt;ref name=SupremeCourt/&gt;

The office complex housing his former practice was demolished on October 10, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&amp;id=8356568 |title=Bradley office complex to be demolished next month |publisher=6abc.com |date=September 16, 2011 |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier, state police confiscated the contents of Bradley's storage locker in [[Rehoboth Beach]] and destroyed them; the items were to be auctioned off to satisfy unpaid rent, but Biden intervened on behalf of the victims to buy them for a symbolic $1 so as not to take the chance of them ever being used again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sanginiti |first=Terri |url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20110129/NEWS01/101290333/Delaware-police-destroy-accused-pediatrician-Earl-B-Bradley-s-toys |title=Delaware police destroy accused pediatrician Earl B. Bradley's toys |work=[[The News Journal]] |date=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradley was held in the Special Housing Unit (SHU) of the [[James T. Vaughn Correctional Center]] in [[New Castle County]] until 2016, when Delaware authorities announced they would move him to an out-of-state prison because many of his victims and/or state residents otherwise affected by his actions either worked in or were incarcerated in Delaware prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fisher, James|url=http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/2016/06/13/bradley-moved-prison-out-state/85659834/|title=Earl Bradley moved to prison out of state|publisher=''[[The News Journal]]''|date=2016-06-13|accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connecticut authorities revealed that Bradley was moved to the [[Cheshire Correctional Institution]] in [[Cheshire, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=Nowinc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delaware1059.com/blog/post.php?postid=700|title=Revealed: Earl Bradley now incarcerated in Cheshire Connecticut|publisher=[[105.9 FM]]|accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''See [[Kata]] for "Form" as used in the context of martial arts.''

'''Form''' is a specific way of performing a movement, often a [[strength training]] exercise, to avoid injury, prevent [[Cheating#Strength_training|cheating]] and increase strength.

=='Proper form'==
Exercises or drills in sport have a recognized way of performing the movements that have two purposes:
===Avoiding injury===
By using proper or 'good and' form, the risk of injury is lowered. A lack of proper form commonly results in injury or a lack of effect from the exercise being performed

===Maximize benefit===
Good form ensures that the movement only uses the main muscles, and avoids recruiting secondary muscles.  As a muscle fatigues, the body attempts to compensate by recruiting other muscle groups and transferring force generation to non-fatigued units.  This reduces the benefits in strength or size gain experienced by the muscles as they are not worked to failure.

A '''Gartner's duct cyst''' (sometimes incorrectly referred to as ''vaginal inclusion cyst'') is a benign [[vaginal cysts|vaginal cyst]] that originates from the [[Gartner's duct]], which is a vestigial remnant of the [[mesonephric duct]] (wolffian duct) in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoogendam JP, Smink M | title = Gartner's Duct Cyst | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 376 | issue = 14 | pages = e27 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28379795 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMicm1609983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They are typically small asymptomatic cysts that occur along the lateral walls of the vagina, following the course of the duct. They can present in adolescence with [[Dysmenorrhea|painful menstruation (Dysmenorrhea)]] or difficulty inserting a tampon.

'''Hodbarrow RSPB Reserve''' is a nature reserve run by the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] on the edge of the [[Lake District]] National Park in [[Cumbria]], [[England]]. It is on the [[Duddon Estuary]] near the town of [[Millom]].  

==History==
The nature reserve occupies a site where [[iron ore]] was mined until the 1960s.
The mining caused subsidence, leading to flooding since the closure of the mine, as the site is no longer dewatered. The reserve continues to be protected from the sea by a [[seawall]] completed in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=876 Hodbarrow Sea Defences]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the area of the reserve is taken up by Hodbarrow Lagoon, a flooded part of the former mine, which is described as a "coastal lagoon".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/seenature/reserves/guide/h/hodbarrow/work.aspx Hodbarrow]. RSPB&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
There is a car park on the Millom side of the reserve from which you can walk to the seawall. (Alternatively, there is more direct pedestrian access to the seawall from [[Haverigg]].)
[[File:Lighthouse at edge of Hodbarrow lagoon - geograph.org.uk - 268459.jpg|thumb|Lighthouse on the seawall with Duddon Estuary behind]]
There is a [[bird hide]] on the seawall which gives views of the lagoon.

==Protection status==
The lagoon was originally a separate [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]], notified in 1983. Following an amalgamation of SSSIs, it is part of the [[Duddon Estuary]] Site of Special Scientific Interest.&lt;ref name="SSSI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Duddon Estuary, Cumbria|url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1000104.pdf|publisher=[[Natural England]]|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Duddon estuary is also an [[Important Bird Area]],&lt;ref&gt;BirdLife International (2016) Important Bird and Biodiversity Area factsheet: Duddon Estuary. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 21/08/2016&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Special Protection Area]].&lt;ref name="JNCC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=1981 | title=Duddon Estuary | accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife==
Hodbarrow has breeding populations of [[tern]]s. It is renowned for large numbers of wildfowl during the winter, especially [[teal]], [[wigeon]], [[coot]], [[mallard]], [[tufted duck]], [[common pochard]], [[goldeneye (duck)|goldeneye]], [[red-breasted merganser]], and occasionally [[long-tailed duck]], [[eider]], [[Common merganser|goosander]], [[northern pintail|pintail]] and [[shoveler]].

Stockholm : Nobel Foundation, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Council of Science Museums. 2005. ''Nobel Prize Winners in Pictures with CD-ROM''. Delhi: Foundation Books, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Medical school|medical university]] in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]] within the [[Stockholm urban area]] of [[Sweden]]. It is recognised as Sweden's best university and one of the largest, most prestigious [[medical universities]] in the world. The [[Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute]] awards the Nobel Prize in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]]. The assembly consists of fifty professors from various medical disciplines at the university. The current [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of Karolinska Institute is [[Ole Petter Ottersen]], who took office in August 2017.

The Karolinska Institute was founded in 1810 on the island of [[Kungsholmen]] on the west side of [[Stockholm]]; the main [[campus]] was relocated decades later to Solna, just outside [[Stockholm Municipality|Stockholm]].  A second campus was established more recently in [[Flemingsberg]], [[Huddinge Municipality|Huddinge]], south of Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;http://ki.se/en/about/ki-through-the-centuries retrieved: 8 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Karolinska Institute is consistently ranked among the top medical universities internationally in a number of ranking tables.

The Karolinska Institute is Sweden's third oldest medical school, after [[Uppsala University]] (founded in 1477) and [[Lund University]] (founded in 1666). It is one of Sweden's largest centres for training and research, accounting for 30% of the medical training and more than 40% of all academic medical and life science research conducted in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ki.se/en/research/research-at-karolinska-institutet|title=Research at Karolinska|access-date=14 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313035349/http://ki.se/en/research/research-at-karolinska-institutet|archive-date=13 March 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Karolinska University Hospital]], located in Solna and Huddinge, is associated with the university as a research and teaching hospital. Together they form an [[academic health science centre]]. While most of the medical programs are taught in Swedish, the bulk of the [[Ph.D.]] projects are conducted in English. The institute's name is a reference to the [[Caroleans]].

== History ==

[[File:Gamla Karolinska Instututet 01.JPG|250px|thumb|Original Caroline Institute buildings at street ''Hantverkargatan'' in Kungsholmen, Stockholm]]

===19th century ===
The Karolinska Institute was founded by King [[Karl XIII]] on 13 December 1810 as an "academy for the training of skilled army surgeons" after one in three soldiers wounded in the [[Finnish War|Finnish War against Russia]] died in field hospitals. Indeed, a report of the time came to the conclusion that "the medical skills of the army barber-surgeons are manifestly inadequate, so Sweden needs to train surgeons in order to better prepare the country for future wars." Just one year later, in 1811, the Karolinska Institute was granted license to train not only surgeons but medical practitioners in general.

[[Image:Kungsholmens glasbruk 1865.jpg|thumb|left|The institute's original building as it appeared in the early 1860s]]
As one of KI's first professors, [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] laid the foundations of the newly inaugurated institute's scientific orientation, which in  1816 is granted the name ''Carolinska Institutet'' (in reference to the [[Caroleans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Risling M, Bellander BM, Cullheim S |title=Traumatic injuries in the nervous system |journal=Front Neurol |volume=3 |issue= |pages=26 |year=2012 |pmid=22375136 |pmc=3285774 |doi=10.3389/fneur.2012.00026}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This name, however, didn't really make an impact at the time and so was expanded to ''Carolinska Medico Chirurgiska institutet'', which proved more popular, especially when preceded by the epithet ''Kongliga'' (Royal), as introduced in 1822. This original institute was situated in the Royal Bakery on [[Riddarholmen]] (a small but central island in Stockholm) and within a just a couple of years had grown to encompass four professorships in anatomy, natural history and pharmacy, theoretical medicine and practical medicine (internal medicine and surgery).

At around the same time Anders Johan Hagströmer, a professor of anatomy and surgery from the Collegium Medicum (the National Board of Health and Welfare of its day), was appointed the institute's first inspector, a post equivalent to today's president. In the same year, the institute moved to the old Glasbruk quarter on Norr Mälarstrand, beside what is now the City Hall. The move across the waters of [[Riddarfjärden]] was accomplished with the help of barges, one of which is said to have capsized, consigning parts of Hagströmer's collection of preparations to the lake bed. Despite this his library survives intact and today forms part of the KI-Swedish Society of Medicine museum at the institute's Hagströmer Library.

[[Image:Widerström, Karolina ur Cederschöld; En banbryterska (1913).jpg|upright|thumb|In 1884 [[Karolina Widerström]] became the first woman to obtain a degree from the Karolinska Institute.]]
In 1861 the institute reached a significant milestone in being awarded the right to confer its own degrees; as such it was granted a status equal to that of a university. This, in turn, led to an increase in the size of the student body, necessitating the demolition of the old building on the Glasbruk plot and its replacement with a new, larger one. This new institute building was built in stages, mostly during the 1880s and into the first decade of the 20th century; it stands to this day, and has remained largely unchanged since its opening.

[[Image:Caroline Institute 1906 Stockholm.jpg|thumb|left|The Karolinska Institute's main building in 1906]]
Although it had already gained the right to confer general degrees, KI wasn't licensed to confer medical degrees until 1874. Previously, even though the institute could run courses in medicine, the right to confer medical degrees was almost exclusively that of Uppsala University. Following on from this change in the institute's status the first doctoral thesis was defended at KI by Alfred Levertin, on the subject of "Om Torpa Källa". Just shortly thereafter the Medical Students' Union was formed.

The next decade was one of firsts. By 1880 the Karolinska Institute had started to accept women and so it was in 1884 that [[Karolina Widerström]] became the first woman to obtain a bachelor's degree in medicine from the institute; she later went on to obtain a Licentiate degree in medicine and chose to specialise in women's medicine and gynaecology. [[Anna Stecksén]] later became the first woman to obtain a doctorate from the university.

Just five years later, following the death of [[Alfred Nobel]] in 1895, the Karolinska Institute received the right to select the recipient of the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physiology or Medicine. Since then, this assignment has given the Karolinska Institute a broad contact network in the field of medical science. Indeed, over the years, five of the institute's own researchers have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

===20th century ===
[[File:Karolinska February 2013 03.jpg|thumb|KI Campus in [[Solna]]. [[Karolinska University Hospital]] is seen in the background.]]
By 1930 the Swedish parliament had decided that a new teaching hospital was needed and resolved to build the new facility at Norrbacka in the [[Solna]] area of Stockholm. The hospital was, from the start, planned to have its theoretical and practical functions side by side, essentially signalling the start of the KI's move to the new site. The chief architect appointed to design the building, later to be named the Karolinska Hospital after a proposal by the Karolinska Institute, was [[Carl Westman]]. Westman worked tirelessly on this project, allowing for completion of the main hospital building by 1940. The hospital was officially opened in the same year along with the new Department of Public Health, KI's first building co-located with the hospital complex, and by 1945 KI moved the last of its departments from Kungsholmen to the Norrbacka site, known to current students and staff as the institute's Solna Campus.

The Karolinska Institute was initially slow to adopt social change. Nanna Svartz became the Karolinska Institute and  Sweden's first state-employed female professor in 1937; she was the only female academic of this rank until Astrid Fagréus became the institute's second female professor almost thirty years later in 1965. However, by the mid-twentieth century student revolts were taking place regularly in the pursuit of greater social equality. It was in response to the largest of these revolts in 1968 that the name of the institute was shortened to the current form ''Karolinska Institutet'', or ''KI''.

[[File:John's University (5540460707) (2).jpg|left|thumb|Campus in [[Huddinge]]]]
By the early 1970s the Huddinge Hospital became increasingly affiliated with the institute and, as more and more of the Karolinska Institute's departments start to move into the hospital buildings, the area developed to become what is KI's Huddinge campus today. It was here that the medical information centre for computer-based citation research (MIC) was set up, making the Karolinska Institute the first [[MEDLARS]] (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System) Centre outside the United States. Similarly innovative work continued at the institute throughout the 1970s, with Sweden's first [[toxicology]] programme commencing at KI in 1976 and the establishment of a [[psychotherapy]] course in 1979. Furthermore, in 1977 the Stockholm Institute of Physiotherapy closed, with the study programme transferring to a new [[physiotherapy]] department at KI.

[[File:Karolinska institutet juni 2013.jpeg|thumb|The institute's campus in Solna]]
In 1982 the Huddinge campus was expanded with the addition of the Novum Research Centre for the study of [[biotechnology]], oral biology, nutrition and toxicology, and [[structural biology|structural biochemistry]]. The number of departments was reduced from 150 to 30 in 1993 and programmes in optometry, biomedicine, and dental technology commenced. The other key feature of the 1990s was the institute's increasingly ambitious plans for commercialisation, as a result of which 'Karolinska Institutet Holding AB' and 'Karolinska Innovations AB' were formed to help the institute intensify its relations with the business community and facilitate scientists' attempts to commercialise their discoveries.

The year 1997 marked a major point in the history of the Karolinska Institute as it was finally granted official university status with a stated mission to "contribute to the improvement of human health through research, education and information". This newly acquired status later led to the incorporation of the Stockholm University of Health Sciences into KI, as a result of which seven new study programmes in occupational therapy, audionomy, midwifery, biomedical laboratory science, nursing, radiology nursing and dental hygiene, were added to KI's teaching portfolio. Around the same time the institute's public health science programme commenced bringing the total number of study programmes to nineteen. Similarly, by this point the institute possessed three student unions: The Medical Students' Union, the Dental Students' Union, and the Physiotherapy Students' Union.

===21st century ===
[[File:Aula Medica, Karolinska Institutet (8960275188).jpg|thumb|The Karolinska Institute's new lecture hall complex, Aula Medica]]

With the turn of the millennium the Karolinska Institute sought to strengthen its activities in the field of external education and research, forming dedicated companies to help it do so and later establishing a fundraising campaign with a target of raising an extra 1 billion kronor for research between 2007 and 2010. During the same period new programmes were established in [[medical informatics]], [[podiatry]], and [[psychology]] as well as master's programmes of one and two years duration, and in 2004, the Karolinska Institute appointed its first female president – Harriet Wallberg-Henriksson, professor of integrative physiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ki.se/en/about/ki-through-the-centuries|title=KI through the centuries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 2010 marked yet another significant event in the history of the KI as the institute celebrated its 200th anniversary under the patronage of King [[Carl XVI Gustaf]]. Shortly thereafter, in 2013, Anders Hamsten assumed his new position as vice-chancellor of the Karolinska Institute, a position he held until when he resigned as in the wake of the [[Paolo Macchiarini#Allegations of research misconduct|Macchiarini affair]].&lt;ref name="Hamsten_resignation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anders Hamsten steps down as Vice-Chancellor of Karolinska Institutet|url=http://ki.se/en/news/anders-hamsten-steps-down-as-vice-chancellor-of-karolinska-institutet|website=Karolinska Institutet|accessdate=13 February 2016|date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seal's symbolism==

===Rod of Asclepius===
[[File:Karolinska Institutet seal.svg|right|200px]]
The rod of Asclepius is named after the god of medicine, [[Aesculapius]] or Asclepius. This ancient god was the son of Apollo and was generally accompanied by a snake. Over time, the snake became coiled around the staff borne by the god.

===Snake bowl===

The snake bowl was originally depicted together with Asclepius' daughter, the virgin goddess of health [[Hygieia]] or Hygiea. The snake ate from her bowl, which was considered to bring good fortune. There is nothing to support the notion that the snake would secrete its venom into the bowl.

===Cockerel===

The [[cockerel]] symbolises new life and was sacrificed to Asclepius by those who had recovered from illness. This is the meaning behind the Greek philosopher [[Socrates]]' last words after he drank the poisoned cup: "Crito, we owe a cock to Asclepius. Do pay it. Don't forget."

==Education==
[[File:Medicinska Föreningen i Solna 20060723.jpg|250px|thumb|Building of the Medical Students' Union ''Medicinska Föreningen'']]
The Karolinska Institute offers the widest range of medical education under one roof in Sweden. Several of the programmes include clinical training or other training within the healthcare system. The close proximity of the Karolinska University Hospital and other teaching hospitals in the Stockholm area thus plays an important role during the education.
Approximately 6,000 full-time students are taking educational and single subject courses at Bachelor and Master levels at the Karolinska Institute. Annually, 20 upper high school students from all over Sweden get selected to attend Karolinska's 7-week long biomedical summer research school, informally named "SoFo".

=== Hong Kong donation controversy ===
In February 2015, the KI announced it had received a record $50 million donation from Lau Ming-wai, who chairs Hong Kong property developer [[Chinese Estates Holdings]], and would establish a research centre in the city. Within a few days, ''[[Next Magazine (Chinese magazine)|Next Magazine]]'' revealed that Chuen-yan &amp;ndash; son of Hong Kong Chief Executive [[CY Leung]] &amp;ndash; had recently been awarded a fellowship to research heart disease therapeutics at the institute in Stockholm beginning that year, and raised questions about the "intricate relationship between the chief executive and powerful individuals". CY Leung had visited KI when in Sweden in 2014, and subsequently introduced KI president, Anders Hamsten, to Lau.&lt;ref name=universityworldnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=2015021809361212|title=Karolinska's Asia campus donation questioned - University World News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=4&amp;art_id=154377&amp;sid=43908462&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20150217&amp;fc=4 "CY denies link over son's job and $400m donation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226092553/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=4&amp;art_id=154377&amp;sid=43908462&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20150217&amp;fc=4 |date=26 February 2015 }}. ''The Standard'', 17 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] urged the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|ICAC]] to investigate the donation, suggesting that Leung may have abused his public position to further his son's career. The Chief Executive's Office strenuously denied suggestions of any quid pro quo, saying that "the admission of the [Chief Executive's] son to post-doctoral research at KI is an independent decision by KI having regard to his professional standards. He [the son] plays no role and does not hold any position at the [proposed] Ming Wai Lau Center for Regenerative Medicine."&lt;ref name=universityworldnews/&gt; This accusation has also been questioned by the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'''s Canadian-based pro-Beijing and pro-government opinion columnist, Alex Lo: "The insinuation is that Leung Chuen-yan with a doctorate from Cambridge doesn't deserve his job at the Karolinska Institute...Leung the son probably could get similar junior posts in many other prestigious-sounding – at least to brand-obsessed Hongkongers – research institutes; it's not that big a deal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/technology/article/1720569/next-magazine-misses-mark-saying-money-influence-behind-leung "Next Magazine misses the mark in saying money, influence behind Leung Chuen-yan getting post at Karolinska Institute"].

==Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute==
[[File:Nobel PressConf GKHansen NTNU1147 (15773258580) (2).jpg|250px|thumb|Press Conference for the Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine 2014, held at the Karolinska Institute]]
{{main article|Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute}}
The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute is a body at the Karolinska Institute which awards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The Nobel Assembly consists of fifty professors in medical subjects at the Karolinska Institute, appointed by the faculty of the Institute, and is a private organisation which is formally not part of the Karolinska Institute. The main work involved in collecting nominations and screening nominees is performed by the Nobel Committee at the Karolinska Institute, which has five members. The Nobel Committee, which is appointed by the Nobel Assembly, is only empowered to recommend laureates, while the final decision rests with the Nobel Assembly.

In the early history of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which was first awarded in 1901, the laurates were decided upon by the entire faculty of the Karolinska Institute. The reason for creating a special body for the decisions concerning the Nobel Prize was the fact that the Karolinska Institute is a state-run university, which in turn means that it is subject to various laws that apply to government agencies in Sweden and similar Swedish public sector organisations, such as freedom of information legislation. By moving the actual decision making to a private body at Karolinska Institute (but not part of it), it is possible to follow the regulations for the Nobel Prize set down by the Nobel Foundation, including keeping the confidentiality of all documents and proceedings for a minimum of 50 years. Also, the legal possibility of contesting the decisions in e.g. administrative courts is removed.

The other two Nobel Prize-awarding bodies in Sweden, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Swedish Academy, are legally private organisations (although enjoying royal patronage), and have therefore not had to make any special arrangements to be able to follow the Nobel Foundation's regulations.

A '''kitchen''' is a [[room (architecture)|room]] or part of a room used for [[cooking]] and [[food preparation]] in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment. A modern middle-class residential kitchen is typically equipped with a [[Kitchen stove|stove]], a [[sink]] with hot and cold running water, a [[refrigerator]], and worktops and kitchen [[cabinet (furniture)|cabinets]] arranged according to a [[Modular Kitchen|modular design]]. Many households have a [[microwave oven]], a [[dishwasher]], and other electric appliances. The main functions of a kitchen are to store, prepare and cook food (and to complete related tasks such as [[dishwashing]]). The room or area may also be used for [[dining]] (or small meals such as breakfast), [[entertaining]] and [[laundry]]. The design and construction of kitchens is a huge market all over the world. The United States are expected to generate $47,730m in the kitchen furniture industry for 2018 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/outlook/17030000/102/kitchen-furniture/europe|title=Kitchen Furniture - Europe {{!}} Statista Market Forecast|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This article is about kitchen as a room.  Details about pans and cookware are not needed in lead. --&gt;

Commercial kitchens are found in [[restaurant]]s, [[cafeteria]]s, [[hotel]]s, [[hospital]]s, educational and workplace facilities, army barracks, and similar establishments. These kitchens are generally larger and equipped with  bigger and more heavy-duty equipment than a residential kitchen. For example, a large restaurant may have a huge walk-in refrigerator and a large commercial dishwasher machine. In some instances commercial kitchen equipment such as commercial sinks are used in household settings as it offers ease of use for food preparation and high durability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.homedecorexpert.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-using-a-commercial-sink-at-home.html|title=The Pros and Cons of Using A Commercial Sink at Home - Home Decor Expert|date=2018-06-14|work=Home Decor Expert|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/09/garden/the-commercial-kitchen-at-home-pros-and-cons-by-carol-vogel.html|title=THE COMMERCIAL KITCHEN AT HOME: PROS AND CONS; BY CAROL VOGEL|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developed countries, commercial kitchens are generally subject to [[public health]] laws. They are inspected periodically by public-health officials, and forced to close if they do not meet hygienic requirements mandated by law.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==

The evolution of the kitchen is linked to the invention of the [[Kitchen stove|cooking range]] or [[stove]] and the development of water infrastructure capable of supplying running water to private homes. Food was cooked over an open [[fire]]. Technical advances in heating food in the 18th and 19th centuries changed the architecture of the kitchen. Before the advent of modern pipes, water was brought from an outdoor source such as [[water well|wells]], pumps or springs.

===Antiquity===
The houses in [[History of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greece]] were commonly of the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]]-type: the rooms were arranged around a central courtyard for women. In many such homes, a covered but otherwise open patio served as the kitchen. Homes of the wealthy had the kitchen as a separate room, usually next to a bathroom (so that both rooms could be heated by the kitchen fire), both rooms being accessible from the court.  In such houses, there was often a separate small storage room in the back of the kitchen used for storing food and [[kitchen utensil]]s.

[[File:Villa Rustica Ahrweiler Küche der Mansio.jpg|thumb|Kitchen with stove and oven of a Roman inn (''Mansio'') at the Roman villa of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, Germany.]]
In the [[Roman Empire]], common folk in cities often had no kitchen of their own; they did their [[cooking]] in large public kitchens. Some had small mobile [[bronze]] stoves, on which a fire could be lit for cooking. Wealthy [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had relatively well-equipped kitchens. In a Roman [[villa]], the kitchen was typically integrated into the main building as a separate room, set apart for practical reasons of [[smoke]] and sociological reasons of the kitchen being operated by [[Slavery|slaves]]. The [[fireplace]] was typically on the floor, placed at a wall&amp;mdash;sometimes raised a little bit&amp;mdash;such that one had to kneel to cook. There were no [[chimney]]s.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Medieval kitchen.jpg|thumb|The roasting spit in this [[Europe]]an Renaissance kitchen was driven automatically by a propeller&amp;mdash;the black cloverleaf-like structure in the upper left.]]

Early medieval European [[longhouse]]s had an open fire under the highest point of the building. The "kitchen area" was between the entrance and the fireplace. In wealthy homes there was typically more than one kitchen. In some homes there were upwards of three kitchens. The kitchens were divided based on the types of food prepared in them.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Theodor, Medieval Homes, Sampson Lowel House 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In place of a chimney, these early buildings had a hole in the roof through which some of the smoke could escape. Besides cooking, the fire also served as a source of heat and light to the single-room building. A similar design can be found in the [[Iroquois]] longhouses of [[North America]].

In the larger homesteads of European nobles, the kitchen was sometimes in a separate sunken floor building to keep the main building, which served social and official purposes, free from [[indoor air quality|indoor smoke]].

The first known stoves in [[Japan]] date from about the same time. The earliest findings are from the [[Kofun period]] (3rd to 6th century). These stoves, called ''kamado'', were typically made of clay and mortar; they were fired with [[wood]] or [[charcoal]] through a hole in the front and had a hole in the top, into which a pot could be hanged by its rim. This type of stove remained in use for centuries to come, with only minor modifications. Like in Europe, the wealthier homes had a separate building which served for cooking. A kind of open fire pit fired with charcoal, called ''irori'', remained in use as the secondary stove in most homes until the [[Edo period]] (17th to 19th century). A ''kamado'' was used to cook the staple food, for instance [[rice]], while ''irori'' served both to cook side dishes and as a heat source.

[[File:Smoke kitchen.jpg|left|thumb|18th century cooks tended a fire and endured smoke in this [[Switzerland|Swiss]] farmhouse smoke kitchen.]]

The kitchen remained largely unaffected by architectural advances throughout the Middle Ages; open fire remained the only method of heating food. European medieval kitchens were dark, smoky, and sooty places, whence their name ''"smoke kitchen"''. In European medieval cities around the 10th to 12th centuries, the kitchen still used an open fire [[hearth]] in the middle of the room. In wealthy homes, the ground floor was often used as a stable while the kitchen was located on the floor above, like the bedroom and the hall. In [[castle]]s and [[monastery|monasteries]], the living and working areas were separated; the kitchen was sometimes moved to a separate building, and thus could not serve anymore to heat the living rooms. In some castles the kitchen was retained in the same structure, but servants were strictly separated from nobles, by constructing separate spiral stone staircases for use of servants to bring food to upper levels.{{cn|date=March 2017}} The kitchen might be separate from the great hall due to the smoke from cooking fires and the chance the fires may get out of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Neil |last1=Christie |first2=Oliver |last2=Creighton |first3=Matt |last3=Edgeworth|first4=Helena |last4=Hamerow |authorlink1=Neil Christie |authorlink4=Helena Hamerow |title=Transforming Townscapes: From burgh to borough: the archaeology of Wallingford, AD 800&amp;ndash;1400 |series=The Society for Medieval Archaeology Monograph Series |number=35 |isbn=978-1-909662-09-4 |location=Oxford |year=2013 |publisher=Society for Medieval Archaeology|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few medieval kitchens survive as they were "notoriously ephemeral structures".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Oliver |last1=Creighton |first2=Neil |last2=Christie |contribution=The Archaeology of Wallingford Castle: a summary of the current state of knowledge |title=Wallingford: The Castle and the Town in Context |editor-first1=K.

In Japanese homes, the kitchen started to become a separate room within the main building at that time.

With the advent of the chimney, the hearth moved from the center of the room to one wall, and the first brick-and-mortar hearths were built. The fire was lit on top of the construction; a vault underneath served to store wood. Pots made of [[iron]], [[bronze]], or [[copper]] started to replace the [[pottery]] used earlier. The temperature was controlled by hanging the pot higher or lower over the fire, or placing it on a [[trivet]] or directly on the hot ashes. Using open fire for cooking (and heating) was risky; fires devastating whole cities occurred frequently.

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] invented an automated system for a rotating spit for spit-roasting: a propeller in the chimney made the spit turn all by itself. This kind of system was widely used in wealthier homes. Beginning in the late [[Middle Ages]], kitchens in Europe lost their home-heating function even more and were increasingly moved from the living area into a separate room. The living room was now heated by [[tiled stove]]s, operated from the kitchen, which offered the huge advantage of not filling the room with smoke.

Freed from smoke and dirt, the living room thus began to serve as an area for social functions and increasingly became a showcase for the owner's wealth. In the upper classes, cooking and the kitchen were the domain of the [[servant (domestic)|servants]], and the kitchen was set apart from the living rooms, sometimes even far from the dining room. Poorer homes often did not yet have a separate kitchen; they kept the one-room arrangement where all activities took place, or at the most had the kitchen in the entrance hall.

[[File:Måleri, genrebild. Köksinteriör - Skoklosters slott - 88962.tif|thumb|300px|Kitchen interior, cirka 1565.]]
The medieval smoke kitchen (or [[Farmhouse kitchen]]) remained common, especially in rural [[Farmhouse (building)|farmhouses]] and generally in poorer homes, until much later. In a few European farmhouses, the smoke kitchen was in regular use until the middle of the 20th century. These houses often had no chimney, but only a smoke hood above the fireplace, made of wood and covered with clay, used to smoke meat. The smoke rose more or less freely, warming the upstairs rooms and protecting the woodwork from vermin.

===Colonial America===
[[File:Belgian Farm Summer Kitchen at Heritage Hill State Historical Park.jpg|thumb|left|Summer kitchen]]
In [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], as in other colonies of [[New England]] during [[Colonial America]], kitchens were often built as separate rooms and were located behind the [[parlor]] and [[hall|keeping room]] or [[dining room]]. One early record of a kitchen is found in the 1648 inventory of the estate of a John Porter of [[Windsor, Connecticut]]. The inventory lists goods in the house "over the kittchin" and "in the kittchin". The items listed in the kitchen were: [[silver spoon]]s, [[pewter]], [[brass]], iron, arms, ammunition, [[hemp]], [[flax]] and "other implements about the room".&lt;ref&gt;The Public Records of the Colony of Connecticut 1636-1776, J. Hammond Trumbull, 1850, Vol. 1, p. 476 [https://archive.org/stream/publicrecordsofc001conn#page/476/mode/2up]&lt;/ref&gt; Separate {{anchor|Summer kitchen}}'''summer kitchens''' were also common on large farms in the north; these were used to prepare meals for harvest workers and tasks such as [[canning]] during the warm summer months, to keep the heat out of the main house.

In the southern states, where the [[climate]] and [[society|sociological]] conditions differed from the north, the kitchen was often relegated to an outbuilding. On [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]], it was separate from the big house or [[mansion]] in much the same way as the feudal kitchen in medieval Europe: the kitchen was operated by [[Slavery|slaves]] in the antebellum years. Their working place was separated from the living area of the masters by the social standards, but more importantly, it was a means to reduce the chance of fire in the main house from kitchen operations.

===Technological advances===
[[File:Kitchen rural 1918.jpg|thumb|A typical rural American kitchen of 1918 at The Sauer-Beckmann Farmstead, Texas]]
Technological advances during [[industrialization]] brought major changes to the kitchen. Iron stoves, which enclosed the fire completely and were more efficient, appeared. Early models included the [[Franklin stove]] around 1740, which was a [[furnace]] stove intended for heating, not for cooking. [[Benjamin Thompson]] in England designed his "Rumford stove" around 1800. This stove was much more energy efficient than earlier stoves; it used one fire to heat several pots, which were hung into holes on top of the stove and were thus heated from all sides instead of just from the bottom. However, his stove was designed for large kitchens; it was too big for domestic use. The "Oberlin stove" was a refinement of the technique that resulted in a size reduction; it was patented in the U.S. in 1834 and became a commercial success with some 90,000 units sold over the next 30 years. These stoves were still fired with [[wood]] or [[coal]]. Although the first [[gas lighting|gas street lamps]] were installed in [[Paris]], [[London]], and [[Berlin]] at the beginning of the 1820s and the first U.S. patent on a [[gas stove]] was granted in 1825, it was not until the late 19th century that using gas for lighting and cooking became commonplace in urban areas.

[[image:Hoosier Cabinet.JPG|thumb|left|A typical Hoosier cabinet of the 1920s.]]

Before and after the beginning of the 20th century, kitchens were frequently not equipped with built-in cabinetry, and the lack of storage space in the kitchen became a real problem. The Hoosier Manufacturing Co. of Indiana adapted an existing furniture piece, the baker's cabinet, which had a similar structure of a table top with some cabinets above it (and frequently flour bins beneath) to solve the storage problem. By rearranging the parts and taking advantage of (then) modern metal working, they were able to produce a well-organized, compact cabinet which answered the home cook's needs for storage and working space.  A distinctive feature of the [[Hoosier cabinet]] is its accessories. As originally supplied, they were equipped with various racks and other hardware to hold and organize spices and various staples. One useful feature was the combination flour-bin/sifter, a tin hopper that could be used without having to remove it from the cabinet. A similar sugar bin was also common.

The [[urbanization]] in the second half of the 19th century induced other significant changes that would ultimately change the kitchen. Out of sheer necessity, cities began planning and building [[Water supply network|water distribution]] pipes into homes, and built [[sanitary sewer|sewers]] to deal with the [[waste water]]. [[Gas pipe]]s were laid; gas was used first for lighting purposes, but once the network had grown sufficiently, it also became available for heating and cooking on gas stoves. At the turn of the 20th century, [[electricity]] had been mastered well enough to become a commercially viable alternative to gas and slowly started replacing the latter. But like the gas stove, the [[electric stove]] had a slow start. The first electrical stove had been presented in 1893 at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]], but it was not until the 1930s that the technology was stable enough and began to take off.

====Industrialization====
Industrialization also caused social changes. The new [[factory]] [[working class]] in the cities was housed under generally poor conditions. Whole families lived in small one or two-room [[apartment]]s in tenement buildings up to six stories high, badly aired and with insufficient lighting. Sometimes, they shared apartments with "night sleepers", unmarried men who paid for a bed at night. The kitchen in such an apartment was often used as a living and sleeping room, and even as a [[bathroom]]. Water had to be fetched from wells and heated on the stove. Water pipes were laid only towards the end of the 19th century, and then often only with one tap per building or per story. Brick-and-mortar stoves fired with coal remained the norm until well into the second half of the century. Pots and kitchenware were typically stored on open shelves, and parts of the room could be separated from the rest using simple curtains.

In contrast, there were no dramatic changes for the upper classes. The kitchen, located in the [[basement]] or the [[ground floor]], continued to be operated by servants. In some houses, water [[pump]]s were installed, and some even had kitchen sinks and drains (but no water on tap yet, except for some feudal kitchens in castles). The kitchen became a much cleaner space with the advent of "cooking machines", closed stoves made of iron plates and fired by wood and increasingly charcoal or coal, and that had [[flue pipe]]s connected to the chimney. For the servants the kitchen continued to also serve as a sleeping room; they slept either on the floor, or later in narrow spaces above a lowered ceiling, for the new stoves with their smoke outlet no longer required a high ceiling in the kitchen. The kitchen floors were tiled; kitchenware was neatly stored in [[cupboard]]s to protect them from dust and steam. A large table served as a workbench; there were at least as many chairs as there were servants, for the table in the kitchen also doubled as the eating place for the servants.

====World War II cooking and dining trends====
The urban middle class imitated the luxurious dining styles of the upper class as best as they could. Living in smaller apartments, the kitchen was the main room—here, the family lived. The study or living room was saved for special occasions such as an occasional dinner invitation. Because of this, these middle-class kitchens were often more homely than those of the upper class, where the kitchen was a work-only room occupied only by the servants. Besides a cupboard to store the [[kitchenware]], there were a table and chairs, where the family would dine, and sometimes—if space allowed—even a [[fauteuil]] or a couch.

[[File:"Lena Horne conserves fuel (gas).", ca. 1941 - ca. 1945 - NARA - 535820.jpg|thumb|left|Gas stove, 1940s]]
Gas pipes were first laid in the late 19th century, and gas stoves started to replace the older coal-fired stoves. Gas was more expensive than coal, though, and thus the new technology was first installed in the wealthier homes. Where workers' apartments were equipped with a gas stove, gas distribution would go through a coin meter.

In rural areas, the older technology using coal or wood stoves or even brick-and-mortar open fireplaces remained common throughout. Gas and water pipes were first installed in the big cities; small villages were connected only much later.

===Rationalization===
[[File:Frankfurter-kueche-vienna.JPG|thumb|The [[Frankfurt kitchen]] using [[Taylorism|Taylorist]] principles]]
The trend to increasing gasification and [[electrification]] continued at the turn of the 20th century. In industry, it was the phase of work [[process optimization]]. [[Taylorism]] was born, and [[Time and motion study|time-motion studies]] were used to optimize processes. These ideas also spilled over into domestic kitchen architecture because of a growing trend that called for a professionalization of household work, started in the mid-19th century by [[Catharine Beecher]] and amplified by [[Christine Frederick]]'s publications in the 1910s.

A stepstone was the kitchen designed in Frankfurt by Margarethe Schütte-Lihotzky. Working class women frequently worked in factories to ensure the family's survival, as the men's wages often did not suffice. [[Social housing]] projects led to the next milestone: the [[Frankfurt Kitchen]]. Developed in 1926, this kitchen measured 1.9&amp;nbsp;m by 3.4&amp;nbsp;m (approximately 6&amp;nbsp;ft 2&amp;nbsp;in by 11&amp;nbsp;ft 2&amp;nbsp;in, with a standard layout). It was built for two purposes: to optimize kitchen work to reduce cooking time and lower the cost of building decently equipped kitchens. The design, created by [[Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky]], was the result of detailed time-motion studies and interviews with future tenants to identify what they needed from their kitchens. Schütte-Lihotzky's fitted kitchen was built in some 10,000 apartments in the housing projects erected in [[Frankfurt]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/arts/27iht-design27.html Modernist triumph in the kitchen]&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial reception was critical: it was so small that only one person could work in it; some storage spaces intended for raw loose food ingredients such as [[flour]] were reachable by children. But the Frankfurt kitchen embodied a standard for the rest of the 20th century in rental apartments: the "work kitchen". It was criticized as "exiling the women in the kitchen", but post-[[World War II]] economic reasons prevailed. The kitchen once more was seen as a work place that needed to be separated from the living areas. Practical reasons also played a role in this development: just as in the bourgeois homes of the past, one reason for separating the kitchen was to keep the steam and smells of cooking out of the living room.

===Unit/fitted===
[[File:Poggenpohl.1892.png|thumb|A kitchen produced by the German company [[Poggenpohl]] in 1892]]
The idea of standardized was first introduced locally with the [[Frankfurt kitchen]], but later defined new in the "Swedish kitchen" (''Svensk köksstandard'', Swedish kitchen standard). The equipment used remained a standard for years to come: hot and cold water on tap and a kitchen sink and an electrical or gas stove and oven. Not much later, the [[refrigerator]] was added as a standard item. The concept was refined in the "Swedish kitchen" using unit furniture with wooden fronts for the kitchen cabinets. Soon, the concept was amended by the use of smooth synthetic door and drawer fronts, first in white, recalling a sense of cleanliness and alluding to sterile lab or hospital settings, but soon after in more lively colors, too.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Some years after the Frankfurt Kitchen, Poggenpohl presented the "reform kitchen" in 1928 with interconnecting cabinets and functional interiors. The reform kitchen was a forerunner to the later unit kitchen and fitted kitchen.

Unit construction since its introduction has defined the development of the modern kitchen. Pre-manufactured modules, using mass manufacturing techniques developed during [[World War II]], greatly brought down the cost of a kitchen. Units which are kept on the floor are called "floor units", "floor cabinets", or "base cabinets" on which a kitchen [[Countertop|worktop]] – originally often [[formica (plastic)|formica]] and often now made of [[granite]], [[marble]], tile or wood – is placed. The units which are held on the wall for storage purposes are termed as "[[wall units]]" or "wall cabinets". In small areas of kitchen in an apartment, even a "tall storage unit" is available for effective storage. In cheaper brands, all cabinets are kept a uniform color, normally white, with interchangeable doors and accessories chosen by the customer to give a varied look. In more expensive brands, the cabinets are produced matching the doors' colors and finishes, for an older more bespoke look.

===Open kitchens===
Starting in the 1980s, the perfection of the [[extractor hood]] allowed an open kitchen again, integrated more or less with the living room without causing the whole apartment or house to smell. Before that, only a few earlier experiments, typically in newly built upper-middle-class family homes, had open kitchens. Examples are [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s ''House Willey'' (1934) and ''House Jacobs'' (1936). Both had open kitchens, with high ceilings (up to the roof) and were aired by [[Skylight (window)|skylight]]s. The extractor hood made it possible to build open kitchens in apartments, too, where both high ceilings and skylights were not possible.

The re-integration of the kitchen and the living area went hand in hand with a change in the perception of cooking: increasingly, cooking was seen as a [[Art|creative]] and sometimes social act instead of work.  And there was a rejection by younger home-owners of the standard suburban model of separate kitchens and dining rooms found in most 1900-1950 houses.  Many families also appreciated the trend towards open kitchens, as it made it easier for the parents to supervise the children while cooking and to clean up spills. The enhanced status of cooking also made the kitchen a prestige object for showing off one's wealth or cooking professionalism. Some [[architect]]s have capitalized on this "object" aspect of the kitchen by designing freestanding "kitchen objects". However, like their precursor, Colani's "kitchen satellite", such futuristic designs are exceptions.

Another reason for the trend back to open kitchens (and a foundation of the "kitchen object" philosophy) is changes in how food is prepared. Whereas prior to the 1950s most cooking started out with raw ingredients and a meal had to be prepared from scratch, the advent of [[frozen meal]]s and pre-prepared [[convenience food]] changed the cooking habits of many people, who consequently used the kitchen less and less. For others, who followed the "cooking as a social act" trend, the open kitchen had the advantage that they could be with their guests while cooking, and for the "creative cooks" it might even become a stage for their cooking performance.

The "Trophy Kitchen" is equipped with very expensive and sophisticated appliances which are used primarily to impress visitors and to project social status, rather than for actual cooking.

===Ventilation===
{{main|Kitchen ventilation}}

The ventilation of a kitchen, in particular a large restaurant kitchen, poses certain difficulties that are not present in the ventilation of other kinds of spaces. In particular, the air in a kitchen differs from that of other rooms in that it typically contains grease, smoke and odours.

==Materials==
The Frankfurt Kitchen of 1926 was made of several materials depending on the application. The modern built-in kitchens of today use [[particle board]]s or MDF, decorated with a variety of materials and finishes including wood veneers, lacquer, glass, melamine, laminate, ceramic and eco gloss. Very few manufacturers produce home built-in kitchens from stainless-steel. Until the 1950s, steel kitchens were used by architects, but this material was displaced by the cheaper particle board panels sometimes decorated with a steel surface.

==Domestic kitchen planning==
[[File:Beecher kitchen.jpg|thumb|Beecher's "model kitchen" brought early [[Ergonomics|ergonomic]] principles to the home]]
[[File:Food over a kitchen - 20111001.jpg|thumb|Food in a kitchen pantry]]
[[File:Walnut-solid-floor.jpg|thumb|block kitchen]]
Domestic (or residential) kitchen design is a relatively recent discipline. The first ideas to optimize the work in the kitchen go back to [[Catharine Beecher]]'s ''A Treatise on Domestic Economy'' (1843, revised and republished together with her sister [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] as ''The American Woman's Home'' in 1869). Beecher's "model kitchen" propagated for the first time a systematic design based on early [[ergonomics]]. The design included regular shelves on the walls, ample work space, and dedicated storage areas for various food items. Beecher even separated the functions of preparing food and cooking it altogether by moving the stove into a compartment adjacent to the kitchen.

[[Christine Frederick]] published from 1913 a series of articles on "New Household Management" in which she analyzed the kitchen following [[Taylorism|Taylorist]] principles of efficiency, presented detailed time-motion studies, and derived a kitchen design from them. Her ideas were taken up in the 1920s by architects in Germany and [[Austria]], most notably [[Bruno Taut]], Erna Meyer, and [[Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky]]. A social housing project in Frankfurt (the ''Römerstadt'' of architect [[Ernst May]]) realized in 1927/38 was the breakthrough for her [[Frankfurt kitchen]], which embodied this new notion of efficiency in the kitchen.

While this "work kitchen" and variants derived from it were a great success for tenement buildings, home owners had different demands and did not want to be constrained by a 6.4&amp;nbsp;m² kitchen. Nevertheless, kitchen design was mostly ad-hoc following the whims of the architect. In the [[United States|U.S.]], the "Small Homes Council", since 1993 the "Building Research Council", of the School of Architecture of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] was founded in 1944 with the goal to improve the state of the art in home building, originally with an emphasis on standardization for cost reduction. It was there that the notion of the ''[[Kitchen Work Triangle|kitchen work triangle]]'' was formalized: the three main functions in a kitchen are storage, preparation, and cooking (which Catharine Beecher had already recognized), and the places for these functions should be arranged in the kitchen in such a way that work at one place does not interfere with work at another place, the distance between these places is not unnecessarily large, and no obstacles are in the way. A natural arrangement is a [[triangle]], with the refrigerator, the sink, and the stove at a vertex each.

This observation led to a few common kitchen forms, commonly characterized by the arrangement of the kitchen cabinets and sink, stove, and refrigerator:
* A ''single-file kitchen'' (also known as a one-way galley or a straight-line kitchen) has all of these along one wall; the work triangle degenerates to a line. This is not optimal, but often the only solution if space is restricted. This may be common in an attic space that is being converted into a living space, or a studio apartment.
* The ''double-file kitchen (or two-way galley)'' has two rows of cabinets at opposite walls, one containing the stove and the sink, the other the refrigerator. This is the classical work kitchen and makes efficient use of space.
* In the ''L-kitchen'', the cabinets occupy two adjacent walls. Again, the work triangle is preserved, and there may even be space for an additional table at a third wall, provided it does not intersect the triangle.
* A ''U-kitchen'' has cabinets along three walls, typically with the sink at the base of the "U". This is a typical work kitchen, too, unless the two other cabinet rows are short enough to place a table at the fourth wall.
* A ''G-kitchen'' has cabinets along three walls, like the U-kitchen, and also a partial fourth wall, often with a double basin sink at the corner of the G shape. The G-kitchen provides additional work and storage space, and can support two work triangles. A modified version of the G-kitchen is the ''double-L'', which splits the G into two L-shaped components, essentially adding a smaller L-shaped island or peninsula to the L-kitchen.
* The ''block kitchen (or island)'' is a more recent development, typically found in open kitchens. Here, the stove or both the stove and the sink are placed where an L or U kitchen would have a table, in a free-standing "island", separated from the other cabinets. In a closed room, this does not make much sense, but in an open kitchen, it makes the stove accessible from all sides such that two persons can cook together, and allows for contact with guests or the rest of the family, since the cook does not face the wall any more. Additionally, the kitchen island's counter-top can function as an overflow-surface for serving buffet style meals or sitting down to eat breakfast and snacks.

In the 1980s, there was a backlash against industrial kitchen planning and cabinets with people installing a mix of work surfaces and free standing furniture, led by kitchen designer [[Johnny Grey]] and his concept of the "unfitted kitchen". Modern kitchens often have enough informal space to allow for people to eat in it without having to use the formal [[dining room]]. Such areas are called "breakfast areas", "breakfast nooks" or "breakfast bars" if the space is integrated into a kitchen counter. Kitchens with enough space to eat in are sometimes called "eat-in kitchens". During the 2000s, flat pack kitchens were popular for people doing [[DIY]] renovating on a budget. The flat pack kitchens industry makes it easy to put together and mix and matching doors, bench tops and cabinets. In flat pack systems, many components can be interchanged.

==Other types==
[[File:Canteen kitchen.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Canteen (place)|canteen]] kitchen]]
[[Restaurant]] and [[Cafeteria|canteen]] kitchens found in [[hotel]]s, [[hospital]]s, educational and work place facilities, army barracks, and similar institutions are generally (in developed countries) subject to [[public health]] laws. They are inspected periodically by public health officials, and forced to close if they do not meet hygienic requirements mandated by law.

Canteen kitchens (and castle kitchens) were often the places where new technology was used first. For instance, [[Benjamin Thompson]]'s "energy saving stove", an early 19th-century fully closed iron stove using one fire to heat several pots, was designed for large kitchens; another thirty years passed before they were adapted for domestic use.

As of 2017, restaurant kitchens usually have tiled walls and floors and use stainless steel for other surfaces (workbench, but also door and drawer fronts) because these materials are durable and easy to clean. Professional kitchens are often equipped with gas stoves, as these allow [[Cook (profession)|cooks]] to regulate the heat more quickly and more finely than electrical stoves. Some special appliances are typical for professional kitchens, such as large installed [[deep fryer]]s, [[Steaming|steamers]], or a [[bain-marie]]. [[File:Food tech room Marling.JPG|thumb|right|The Food Technology room at [[Marling School]] in [[Stroud, Gloucestershire]].]]

The [[fast food]] and [[convenience food]] trends have changed the manner in which restaurant kitchens operate. Some of these type restaurants may only "finish" convenience food that is delivered to them, or just reheat completely prepared meals. At the most they may [[grilling|grill]] a [[hamburger]] or a [[steak]]. But in the early 21st century, c-stores (convenience stores) are attracting greater market share by performing more food preparation on-site and better customer service than some fast food outlets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.qsrmagazine.com/exclusives/c-stores-eating-your-lunch Christine Blank, "C-Stores Eating Your Lunch"], ''QSR Magazine'', 09 January 2014; accessed 21 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The kitchens in [[railway]] [[dining car]]s have presented special challenges: space is limited, and, personnel must be able to serve a great number of meals quickly. Especially in the early history of railways, this required flawless organization of processes; in modern times, the [[microwave oven]] and prepared meals have made this task much easier. Kitchens aboard [[ship]]s, [[aircraft]] and sometimes [[Railroad_car|railcars]] are often referred to as [[Galley (kitchen)|galleys]]. On [[yacht]]s, galleys are often cramped, with one or two burners fueled by an [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LP gas]] bottle. Kitchens on [[cruise ship]]s or large [[warship]]s, by contrast, are comparable in every respect with restaurants or canteen kitchens. 

On passenger [[airliner]]s, the kitchen is reduced to a [[pantry]].  The crew's role is to heat and serve in-flight meals delivered by a [[catering]] company. An extreme form of the kitchen occurs in space, ''e.g.'', aboard a [[Space Shuttle]] (where it is also called the "galley") or the [[International Space Station]]. The [[astronaut]]s' food is generally completely prepared, [[Dehydration|dehydrated]], and sealed in plastic pouches before the flight. The kitchen is reduced to a rehydration and heating module.

Outdoor areas where food is prepared are generally not considered kitchens, even though an outdoor area set up for regular food preparation, for instance when [[camping]], might be referred to as an "outdoor kitchen". An outdoor kitchen at a [[campsite]] might be placed near a well, water pump, or water tap, and it might provide tables for food preparation and cooking (using portable campstoves). Some campsite kitchen areas have a large tank of [[propane]] connected to burners, so that campers can cook their meals. Military camps and similar temporary settlements of [[nomad]]s may have dedicated kitchen tents, which have a vent to enable cooking smoke to escape.

In schools where home economics, [[food technology]] (previously known as "[[domestic science]]"), or [[culinary arts]] are taught, there are typically a series of kitchens with multiple equipment (similar in some respects to [[laboratory|laboratories]]) solely for the purpose of teaching. These consist of multiple workstations, each with its own [[oven]], [[sink]], and kitchen utensils, where the teacher can show students how to prepare food and cook it.

==By region==
===China===

Kitchens in China are called {{lang|zh|chúfáng（厨房)}}. More than 3000 years ago, the ancient Chinese used the [[Ding (vessel)|ding]] for cooking food.  The ding was developed into the [[wok]] and pot used today. Many Chinese people believe that there is a [[Kitchen God]] who watches over the kitchen for the family. According to this belief, the god returns to heaven to give a report to the [[Jade Emperor]] annually about this family behavior. Every Chinese New Year Eve, families will gather together to pray for the kitchen god to give a good report to heaven and wish him to bring back good news on the fifth day of the New Year. 
  
The most common cooking equipment in Chinese family kitchens and restaurant kitchens are woks, steamer baskets and pots. The fuel or heating resource was also important technique to practice the cooking skills. Traditionally  Chinese were using wood or straw as the fuel to cook food. A Chinese chef had to master flaming and heat radiation to reliably prepare traditional recipes. Chinese cooking will use a pot or wok for pan frying, stir frying, deep frying or boiling.

===Japan===
{{main|Japanese kitchen}}
Kitchens in Japan are called '''Daidokoro''' (台所; lit. "kitchen"). Daidokoro is the place where food is prepared in a [[Housing in Japan|Japanese house]]. Until the [[Meiji era]], a kitchen was also called ''kamado'' (かまど; lit. [[stove]]) and there are many sayings in the [[Japanese language]] that involve kamado as it was considered the symbol of a house and the term could even be used to mean "family" or "household" (similar to the English word "hearth"). When separating a family, it was called ''Kamado wo wakeru'', which means "divide the stove". ''Kamado wo yaburu'' (lit. "break the stove") means that the family was bankrupt.

===India===

In India, a kitchen is called a “Rasoi” (in hindi\Sanskrit)  or a “Swayampak ghar” in Marathi , and there exist many other names for it in the various regional languages. Many different methods of cooking exist across the country, and the structure and the materials used in constructing kitchens have varied depending on the region. For example, in north and central India, cooking used to be carried out in clay ovens called “Chulha”s, fired by wood, coal or dried cowdung. In households where members observed vegetarianism, separate kitchens were maintained to cook and store vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. Religious families often treat the kitchen as a sacred space. Indian kitchens are built on an Indian architectural science called vastushastra. The Indian kitchen vastu is of utmost importance while designing a kitchens in India. Modern-day architects also follow the norms of vastushastra while designing Indian kitchens across the world.

While many kitchens belonging to poor families continue to use clay stoves and the older forms of fuel, the urban middle and upper classes usually have gas stoves with cylinders or piped gas attached. Electric cooktops are rarer since they consume a great deal of electricity, but microwave ovens are gaining popularity in urban households and commercial enterprises. Indian kitchens are also supported by biogas and solar energy as fuel. World's largest solar energy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://inhabitat.com/world%E2%80%99s-largest-solar-kitchen-in-india-can-cook-upto-38500-meals-per-day/|title=World’s Largest 38500-meal Solar Kitchen in India|access-date=2017-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; kitchen is built in India. In association with government bodies, India is encouraging domestic biogas plants to support the kitchen system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1537">The '''linea alba''' (Latin for ''white line''), in [[dentistry]],&lt;ref name="pmid11788804"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Martínez Díaz-Canel AI, García-Pola Vallejo MJ |title=Epidemiological study of oral mucosa pathology in patients of the Oviedo School of Stomatology |journal=Med Oral |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=4–9, 10–6 |year=2002 |pmid=11788804 |doi= |url=http://www.medicinaoral.com/medoralfree/v7i1/medoralv7i1p4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a horizontal streak on the [[Buccal mucosa|inner surface]] of the cheek, level with the [[Occlusion (dentistry)|biting]] plane. It usually extends from the [[commissure]] to the posterior teeth and can extend to the inner lip mucosa and corners of the mouth.

It is a common finding and most likely associated with pressure, frictional irritation, or sucking trauma from the facial surfaces of the teeth. It may be found in individuals who chew tobacco, and may be mistaken for a lesion requiring treatment.

==Clinical considerations==
*The linea alba is usually present bilaterally.
*It is restricted to dentulous areas (i.e. in areas where there are missing teeth the line will be absent - unless a [[denture]] is worn).
*It presents an asymptomatic, linear elevation, with a whitish colour, at the level of the occlusal line of the teeth.

==Treatment==
Treatment is not required.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7854">A '''[[biobank]]''' is a physical place which stores [[biobank specimens]].  In some cases, participant data is also collected and stored. Access policies details may vary across biobanks but generally involve obtaining [[ethics]] approval from [[institutional review board]]s and scientific review or [[peer review]] approval from the institutions under which the biobanks operate as well as Ethics approval from the institutions where the research projects will be undertaken.  The samples and data are safeguarded so that researchers can use them in experiments deemed adequate.  This page contains a list of biobanks.

==Classification==
Biobanks can be classified in several ways.  Some examples of how they can be classified is by their controlling entity (government, commercial enterprise, or private research institution), by their geographical location, or by what sorts of samples they collect.

Biobanks may be classified by purpose or design. Disease-oriented biobanks usually have a hospital affiliation through which they collect samples representing a variety of diseases, perhaps to look for biomarkers affiliated with disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bevilacqua | first1 = G. | last2 = Bosman | first2 = F. | last3 = Dassesse | first3 = T. | last4 = Höfler | first4 = H. | last5 = Janin | first5 = A. | last6 = Langer | first6 = R. | last7 = Larsimont | first7 = D. | last8 = Morente | first8 = M.

'''Mental health inequality''' refers to the differences in quality of [[mental health]] and mental health care for different identities and populations. Mental health can be defined as well-being and/or the absence of clinically defined [[mental illness]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2003) Investing in mental health. Geneva, World Health Organization (&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/investing_mnh.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; ).&lt;/ref&gt; There are social economic factors that influence individuals or groups of people of a certain demographic. This can be a factor to mental health care access. Inequalities may include presence of mental health, access to mental health care, quality of mental health care, and mental health outcomes between populations with different [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[sexual orientation]], sex, [[gender]], [[socioeconomic status]]es, education level, and geographic location.

== Predictors ==

=== Socioeconomic status disparities ===
Social determinants of health are factors such as economic status, education level, demographics, where you live and genetics that can influence one's health. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/hsnsw/Publications/classifications-project.pdf|title=Public Health Determinants of health|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to experiences certain populations are much more susceptible to mental disorders or illnesses. Traumatic experiences can develop by the lack of resources of the determinants of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1797101|title=Are the brown and Harris vulnerable factors for depression ?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not having employment or being from a certain area where those resources are limited trigger some of the most common mental disorders. ( Depression, anxiety, bipolar, psychological stress)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-types-illness#1|title=Types of Mental Illness|work=WebMD|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental health within itself leads to the inequality among the social determinants of health. The economic level of one's life is a factor to their life expectancy and mental health. For example lung cancer is by far the most preventable disease yet the rates of consumption of tobacco just increase. Ironically the consumers are those with mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/e557702010-001|title=Mental Health of Children and Young People in Great Britain, 2004|last=Green|first=Hazel|last2=McGinnity|first2=Ainee|date=2005|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|access-date=2018-10-14|last3=Meltzer|first3=Howard|last4=Ford|first4=Tamsin|last5=Goodman|first5=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education disparities ===
While education and mental health seem mutually exclusive, there is a significant parallel between the inequities. Educational disparities can be defined as unjust or unfair differences in educational outcomes that can be a result of difference in treatment of certain minority groups in schools, varying socioeconomic statuses, and varying educational needs.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2012|title=Ethnic and Racial Disparities in Education: Psychology's Contributions to Understanding and Reducing Disparities|url=http://www.apa.org/ed/resources/racial-disparities.pdf|journal=American Psychological Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These disparities in education can ultimately lead to issues of mental health. When this happens, less privileged groups get looped into the cascading effects of inequality.

The disparities that arise in education do not happen by chance. There are definitely predictors that factor into these inequalities. Some common ones are socioeconomic status, immigrant status, and ethnic/racial status.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Socioeconomic status plays a large role in the difference in access to educational resources. School districts are split geographically. Because the current funding for public schools comes from local property taxes, there is more incentive for high-status individuals to narrow the boundaries to not include lower income families from their school districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thenotebook.org/articles/2016/08/23/study-examines-how-school-district-borders-exacerbate-school-segregation|title=Study examines how district boundaries exacerbate school segregation|website=thenotebook.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because each school district is then only encompassing one socioeconomic group, the programs and quality are affected. This is where we begin to see the dramatic differences between school districts. While some schools offer amazing guidance departments, advanced classes, and phenomenal facilities, other areas struggle to find qualified and motivated teachers to teach basic classes. Although public education is something that is supposed to be a right for all, an individual's socioeconomic status can greatly affect the quality of that education.

An individual's immigration status also affects the quality of education received. While there are some immigrant groups which do well after immigrating to the United States, many do not have the same level of success. There are many barriers that prevent the academic success of immigrant children. These barriers include but are not limited to the fact that most parents of immigrant children do not understand the United States educational system, inadequate English as a Second Language programs, and segregation. There are also differences in outcomes across immigrant generation, with first-generation immigrants performing better than subsequent generations. This is termed the [[immigrant paradox]]. These issues along with the psychological effects of [[acculturation]] (e.g., adapting to a whole new country, language, and culture) amplify educational inequality.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Disparities in education are the insufficiency of resources that are included but limited. These disparities usually targets socially excluded communities with low income. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/unequal-opportunity-race-and-education/|title=Unequal Opportunity: Race and Education|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics are used when measuring grades, GPA, test scores, and dropout rates to determine the success of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3102/003465430303947|title=Race, School &amp;. Achievement|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disparities as such affect somones mental health by creating a system in which a person could never succeed.

=== Spatial disparities (geographic location) ===
Further research observes that those minority races living in areas of low-poverty have more and easier access to mental health services than those in high-poverty neighborhoods. There is a pattern of people in high-poverty areas being unable escape this cycle. Due to these conditions, inequality remains and they are unable to gain access to mental health care which can be very beneficial to those who may be suffering from stress due to lack of resources and money.

Many minorities including African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans inhabit these poverty filled neighborhoods due to factors being not in their favor in certain aspects of society. These neighborhoods lack resources such as offices with psychiatrists or health clinics with good doctors who are trained to help those in need of mental health care. It would also be beneficial to make specific services just for those in high-poverty neighborhoods who lack the resources so we can encourage those in need to get the help that they deserve. With adjustments made to meet these circumstances, the spatial disparities can be lowered and allow those who need the help to get it.

=== Ethnic and racial disparities ===
There is inequality in mental health care access for different races and ethnicities. It is known through much research that even poor minorities have less access to mental health care than poor non-Latino whites.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alegría|first=Margarita|last2=Canino|first2=Glorisa|last3=Ríos|first3=Ruth|last4=Vera|first4=Mildred|last5=Calderón|first5=José|last6=Rusch|first6=Dana|last7=Ortega|first7=Alexander N.|date=2002-12-01|title=Mental Health Care for Latinos: Inequalities in Use of Specialty Mental Health Services Among Latinos, African Americans, and Non-Latino Whites|url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ps.53.12.1547|journal=Psychiatric Services|volume=53|issue=12|pages=1547–1555|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.53.12.1547|issn=1075-2730}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is also known that blacks have even less of a chance to access to mental health services and care than those who are white.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Many of these minorities may confront an issue directly resulting in the search for mental health care support, yet they don't have the same access as other people.

After surveying people of different races over years we observe that African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans gain less access to the same type of mental services that non-minority whites get access to.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chow|first=Julian Chun-Chung|last2=Jaffee|first2=Kim|last3=Snowden|first3=Lonnie|date=2017-04-07|year=|title=Racial/Ethnic Disparities in the Use of Mental Health Services in Poverty Areas|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=93|issue=5|pages=792–797|issn=0090-0036|pmc=1447841|pmid=12721146|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this research there was a piece that stated:

"This theory postulates that Whites have a greater propensity to avoid living in poverty communities because they are more likely to enjoy social and economic advantages. Only seriously mentally ill Whites suffer from steep downward mobility and come to reside in high-poverty neighborhoods"&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; (Julian Chun-Chung Chow, Kim Jaffee, and Lonnie Snowden).

This has been a problem for minority races that need the same services. It is an issue because African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans need the services more in certain areas due to how biologically certain minority races are more likely to be diagnosed with a mental illness than whites.

=== LGBTQ disparities and predictors ===
{{See also|LGBTQ psychology}}
Sexuality plays a large role in the prediction of mental illnesses and overall mental health. Those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer have a higher risk of having mental health issues, most likely as a result of the continued discrimination and victimization they receive at the hands of others. Members of this population are confronted with derogatory and hateful comments, whether through face-to-face communication or through [[social media]], which affects their self-worth and confidence, leading to anxiety, depression, thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts, and suicide. These mental health effects are most commonly seen among adolescents, however, they are also prevalent among adults of all ages.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=U-M Weblogin|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1744-6171.2010.00246.x/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6171.2010.00246.x | volume=23|journal=Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Nursing|pages=205–213 | last1 = Ryan | first1 = Caitlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mustanski|first=Brian S.|last2=Garofalo|first2=Robert|last3=Emerson|first3=Erin M.|title=Mental Health Disorders, Psychological Distress, and Suicidality in a Diverse Sample of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youths|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2009.178319|journal=American Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=100|issue=12|pages=2426–2432|doi=10.2105/ajph.2009.178319|pmc=2978194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sources of discrimination and victimization that the [[LGBTQ]] population suffers from can be both external and internal. While parts of society today are not accepting of the LGBTQ community and make public statements to advertise their discontent, an identifying LGBTQ can also have low confidence and a lack of self-worth that furthers these negative mental health effects.

The most notable predictor of mental health illnesses among the LGBTQ population is family acceptance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Those of the LGBTQ population who receive little or no family support and acceptance are three times more likely to have thoughts of suicide than those who do have a strong family support system behind them. Oftentimes, the lack of familial support is more conducive of detrimental behaviors, such as drug and illegal substance abuse, which can cause further harm to the individual. Multiple aspects of lifestyles, including religion, can affect family support. Those who have strong family ties to religion may be less likely to seek support and help from family members due to fear of a lack of acceptance within the family, as well as within the religious community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Sex and gender disparities and predictors ===
While [[Mental disorders and gender|gender differences among those with mental health disorders]] are an underdeveloped field of study, there are gender specific aspects to life that cause disparities. Gender is often a determinant of the amount of power one has over factors in their life, such as socioeconomic status and social position, and the stressors that go along with these factors. The location of genders and sex within the social construct can be a great determinant of risks and predictors of mental health disorders. These disparities in gender can correlate to the disparities in the types of mental health disorders that individuals have. While all genders and sexes are at risk of a large variety of mental health illnesses, some illnesses and disorders are more common among one sex than another. Women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with forms of depression, whereas men are three times more likely to be given a diagnosis of a social anxiety disorder than women.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/genderwomen/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Gender and women's mental health|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex can also be a determinant of other aspects of mental health as well. The time of onset of symptoms can be different dependent on one's sex. Women are more likely to show signs of mental illnesses, such as depression, earlier and at a younger age than men. Many believe this to be a correlation with the onset time of puberty. As a result of social stigmatisms and stereotypes within society, women are also more likely to be prescribed mood-altering medications, whereas men are more likely to be prescribed medications for addictions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Further research on the mental health disparities among sex and gender is needed in order to gain a deeper knowledge of the predictors of mental health and the possible differences in treatments.

== Disparities in success to mental health care ==
Over the past decade, many of the disparities regarding mental health stem from differences in racial/ethnic groups. Mental illness is one of the highest health burdens for minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Benjamin Lê|last2=Trinh|first2=Nhi-Ha|last3=Li|first3=Zhihui|last4=Hou|first4=Sherry Shu-Yeu|last5=Progovac|first5=Ana M.|title=Trends in Racial-Ethnic Disparities in Access to Mental Health Care, 2004–2012|url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ps.201500453|journal=Psychiatric Services|language=en|volume=68|issue=1|pages=9–16|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.201500453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many minority groups, certain mental illnesses are under and over diagnosed. For example, schizophrenia is over diagnosed in African Americans while mood disorders, depression, and anxiety are under diagnosed.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This is due to a variety of reasons. The recognition of mental illness is often thought of in conjunction with stereotypes regarding African Americans. Those who present symptoms exhibiting depression and mood swings may be mistaken as stereotypically violent.

While the diagnosis of these minority groups is vastly different, the care they receive also varies between whites and minority groups. This is not only due to external factors and facilities but also the way in which these minority groups choose to proceed with treatment. African Americans generally do receive care from lower quality facilities, but they are also more likely than whites to terminate treatment prematurely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGuire|first=Thomas G.|last2=Miranda|first2=Jeanne|date=2008-01-01|year=|title=Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health Care: Evidence and Policy Implications|journal=Health Affairs (Project Hope)|volume=27|issue=2|pages=393–403|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.27.2.393|issn=0278-2715|pmc=3928067|pmid=18332495|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, health care plans are also a major contributor to the inequities in mental health care access. Provider discrimination involves health care providers unfairly using stereotypes to decide how to distribute diagnoses. Physicians often rely on common stereotypes of individuals in deciding treatment, which ultimately leads to minority groups not getting the specialized treatment required to diagnose and treat mental illness.

== Disparities in quality of mental health care ==
There is a growing unmet need for mental health services and equity in the quality of these services. While these services often advertise themselves as being a support system and caregiver for any and all who need treatment or support, oftentimes certain aspects of an individual's life, such as race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, will determine the type of care that they are given.

Due to a growing level of socioeconomic inequality among races, African Americans are less likely to have access to mental health care and are more likely to have lesser quality care when they do find it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Benjamin L.|last2=McGuire|first2=Thomas|last3=Miranda|first3=Jeanne|date=2007-12-01|title=Measuring Trends in Mental Health Care Disparities, 2000–2004|url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/ps.2007.58.12.1533|journal=Psychiatric Services|volume=58|issue=12|pages=1533–1540|doi=10.1176/ps.2007.58.12.1533|issn=1075-2730}}&lt;/ref&gt; African Americans and Hispanics are more likely to be uninsured or have [[Medicaid]], limiting the amount and type of access that they have mental health outpatient sources. In one study, of all those who received mental health care, minority populations reported a higher degree of unmet needs and dissatisfaction with the services they were given (12.5% of whites, 25.4% of African Americans, and 22.6% of Hispanics reported poor care).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wells|first=Kenneth|last2=Klap|first2=Ruth|last3=Koike|first3=Alan|last4=Sherbourne|first4=Cathy|date=2001-12-01|title=Ethnic Disparities in Unmet Need for Alcoholism, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Care|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.158.12.2027|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=158|issue=12|pages=2027–2032|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.12.2027|issn=0002-953X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LGBTQ population, while still open to the same disparities as racial minority groups, is often confronted with the problem of being denied mental health treatment because of the gender they identify as or their sexual orientation. In a study conducted by The National Center for Transgender Equality and the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]], 19% of the LGBTQ sample reported being denied the healthcare they needed. In addition, 28% of the sample reported being harassed or even physically assaulted during the health visit.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nursingstudentsforsexualandreproductivehealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Tab-6-Supplements-Web.pdf|title=National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report on health and health care|last=|first=|date=National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While denial of treatment and harassment during treatment are large causes of the disparities among mental health care quality, the lack of knowledge is also of concern among the LGBTQ population. As it is such a newly developing field of study, there is very little knowledge or research conducted that relate specifically to LGBTQ health and healthcare. Because of this, about 50% of the LGBTQ population report having to teach aspects of their health and treatment to the health care providers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Suggestions on how to achieve better mental health equality ==
Because mental health inequality is largely due to disparities in health insurance, ways to improve mental health equity must come from changes in healthcare policies. While much of mental health disparities comes from improving access to healthcare for the underprivileged. The biggest reason why people are not obtaining mental health care is because they cannot afford it. Also, changing the content of healthcare literature to include mental health is equally important. The United States has made massive strides to break down the stigmas surrounding mental health. Given that, mental health is still not considered to be a main part of basic health care plans. In order for individuals to receive the treatment necessary for mental illness, it must be acknowledged as an illness.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/707963#vp_2|title=Disparities in Access to Mental Health Services by African Americans: An Expert Interview With Annelle B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9115">The '''Methodic school''' of [[medicine]] (''Methodics'', ''Methodists'', or ''Methodici'', {{lang-el|Μεθοδικοί}}) was an ancient school of medicine in [[Ancient Greek medicine|ancient Greece]] and [[Medicine in ancient Rome|Rome]]. The Methodic school arose in reaction to both the [[Empiric school]] and the [[Dogmatic school]] (sometimes referred to as the Rationalist school).&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Brunschwig, Burnyeat, Schofield 1982, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; While the exact origins of the Methodic school are shrouded in some controversy, its doctrines are fairly well documented. [[Sextus Empiricus]] points to the school's common ground with [[Pyrrhonism]], in that it “follow[s] the appearances and take[s] from these whatever seems expedient.”&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' I.237, trans. Etheridge (''Scepticism, Man, and God'', Wesleyan University Press, 1964, p. 98).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

There is no clear consensus on who founded the Methodic school and when it was founded. It has been purported that the Methodic school was founded by the students of [[Asclepiades of Bithynia|Asclepiades]].&lt;ref&gt;Yapijakis, C: ‘’Hippocrates of Kos, the Father of Clinical Medicine, and Asclepiades of Bithynia, the Father of Molecular Medicine’’. International Institute of Anticaner Research, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[Themison of Laodicea]], [[Asclepiades of Bithynia|Asclepiades]]’ most distinguished student, is often credited with founding the Methodic school in the first century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Boylan, Michael: ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', ''Galen'' http://www.iep.utm.edu/galen/&lt;/ref&gt; However, some historians claim that the Methodic school was founded by [[Asclepiades of Bithynia|Asclepiades]] himself in 50 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Charles Garratt|Garratt, Alfred Charles]], ''Myths in Medicine and Old-Time Doctors''. 1884.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been claimed that the Methodism does not truly arise until the first century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Brunschwig, Burnyeat, Schofield 1982, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, it is widely accepted that Methodism arose as a reaction to the [[Empiric school|Empiric]] and Rationalist (or [[Dogmatic school|Dogmatic]]) schools, bearing some similarities to both schools but fundamentally different.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Brunschwig, Burnyeat, Schofield 1982, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrines==

The Methodic school emphasized the treatment of diseases rather than the history of the individual patient. According to the Methodists, medicine is no more than a “knowledge of manifest generalities” (''gnōsis phainomenōn koinotēnōn''). In other words, medicine was no more than the awareness of general, recurring features that manifest in a tangible way. While Methodist views on medicine are slightly more complex than this, the above generalization was meant to apply to not only medicine, but to any art. Methodists conceive of medicine as a true art, in contrast to Empiricists or Dogmatists.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Brunschwig, Burnyeat, Schofield 1982, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

They asserted that the knowledge of the cause of the disease bears no relation to the method of cure, and that it is sufficient to observe some general symptoms of [[illness]]es. All a doctor really needs to know is the disease itself, and from that knowledge alone will he know the treatment. To claim that knowledge of the disease alone will provide knowledge of the treatment, the Methodists first claim that diseases are indicative of their own treatments. Just as how hunger leads a person naturally to food and how thirst leads a person naturally to water, so too does the disease naturally indicate the cure. As [[Sextus Empiricus]] points out, when a dog is pricked by a thorn, it naturally removes the foreign object ailing its body.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Brunschwig, Burnyeat, Schofield 1982, p. 4,5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The core theory was disruption of the normal circulation of '[[atoms]]' through the body's '[[Porosity|pores]]' caused disease. To cure a disease it is sufficient to observe some general symptoms of [[illness]]es; and that there are three kinds of diseases, one bound, another loose (''fluens'', a disorder attended with some [[Mucopurulent discharge|discharge]]), and the third a mixture of these. Sometimes the excretions of sick people are too small or too large, or a particular excretion might be deficient or excessive. These kinds of illnesses are sometimes severe, sometimes chronic, sometimes increasing, sometimes stable, and sometimes abating. As soon as it is known to which of these diseases an illness belongs, if the body is bound, then it must be opened; if it is loose, then it must be restrained; if it is complicated, then the most urgent malady must be fought first. One type of treatment is required in acute, another in inveterate illnesses; another when diseases are increasing, another when stable, and another when decreasing. The observation of these things constitute the art of medicine, called ''method'' ({{lang-el|Μέθοδος}}).

As the seeking after the causes of diseases seemed to Themison to rest on too uncertain a foundation, he thus wished to establish his system upon the analogies and indications common to many diseases ({{lang-el|κοινότες}}), no matter that these analogies were as obscure as the causes of the Dogmatic school. Themison wrote several works which are now lost.

==Differences from the Empiric and Dogmatic Schools==

The Methodic school takes it to be that once a doctor has recognized the disease a patient has for what it is, the treatment that should follow is inherently obvious. It is not a matter of inference or observation, but of an immediate knowledge. To a Dogmatist, the symptoms a disease manifest is indicative of a hidden state that causes the disease. Only by knowing the hidden state can a doctor understand how to treat a patient. The symptoms manifested by a patient are indicative of the underlying state causing the disease, and the hidden state is indicative of the treatment that follows. Like the Empiricists, the Methodists refuse the notion of hidden states, claiming that there is no need to take a detour into inferences of hidden states. The symptoms manifested make it immediately obvious what needs to be done.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Brunschwig, Burnyeat, Schofield 1982, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Methodists also reject the Empiricist notion that the connection between a disease and its treatment is a matter of experience. Methodists purport that experience is not necessary to understand that a state of depletion implies a need for replenishment, that a state of restraint must be loosened. To a Methodist, treatments to diseases are immediately obvious; it is a matter of common sense, of reason. There is no need for justification by experience; to Methodists, there are no conceivable alternatives to their innate knowledge of proper treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Brunschwig, Burnyeat, Schofield 1982, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Methodists do not take their knowledge of proper treatment as an issue of observation or experience, they are willing to concede that their knowledge is a matter of reason. On this point, the Methodists bear a similarity to Dogmatists, taking reason as a constructive approach to appropriating the proper treatment for an ailment. However, Methodists do not support the Dogmatic concept of employing reason to find hidden causes that belie the disease manifested. The causes of diseases can not be fantastic or obscure forces that would not occur in ordinary life.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Brunschwig, Burnyeat, Schofield 1982, p. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The key difference between Methodist doctors and Empiricist or Dogmatic doctors is that a Methodist's knowledge is "firm and certain," and that it leaves no room for future revision. Rather than rely upon reason and experience, the Methodist does what is inherently obvious; there is no room for error.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Brunschwig, Burnyeat, Schofield 1982, p. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26713">'''Molecular mimicry''' is defined as the theoretical possibility that sequence similarities between foreign and self-peptides are sufficient to result in the cross-activation of autoreactive [[T cells|T]] or [[B cells]] by pathogen-derived [[peptides]]. Despite the prevalence of several peptide sequences which can be both foreign and self in nature, a single [[antibody]] or TCR ([[T cell receptor]]) can be activated by just a few crucial residues which stresses the importance of structural [[homology (chemistry)|homology]] in the theory of molecular mimicry. Upon the activation of B or [[T cells]], it is believed that these "peptide mimic" specific T or B cells can cross-react with self-epitopes, thus leading to tissue pathology ([[autoimmunity]]).&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kohm, A.P., Fuller, K.G. and Miller, S.D.|title=Mimicking the way to autoimmunity: an evolving theory of sequence and structural homology.|journal=Trends in Microbiology|volume=11|pages=101–105|year=2003|doi=10.1016/S0966-842X(03)00006-4|pmid=12648936|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular mimicry is a phenomenon that has been just recently discovered as one of several ways in which autoimmunity can be evoked. A molecular mimicking event is, however, more than an epiphmenon despite its low statistical probability of occurring and these events have serious implications in the onset of many human autoimmune disorders.

In the past decade the study of autoimmunity System, the failure to recognize self [[antigens]] as "self", has grown immensely. Autoimmunity is thought by many researchers to be a result of a loss of [[immunological tolerance]], the ability for an individual to discriminate between self and non-self, though others are beginning to think that many autoimmune diseases are due to mutations governing programmed cell death, or to environmental products that injure target tissues, thus causing a release of immunostimulatory alarm signals,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Matzinger, P|title=An innate sense of Danger|journal=seminars in Immunology|volume=10|pages=399–415|year=1998|doi=10.1006/smim.1998.0143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Matzinger, P|title=The Danger Model: A Renewed Sense of Self|journal=Science|volume=296|page=5566|year=2002|doi=10.1126/science.1071059|pmid=11951032
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth in the field of autoimmunity has resulted in more and more frequent diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. Consequently, recent data show that autoimmune diseases affect approximately 1 in 31 people within the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Shoenfeld, Y.  |author2=Gershwin, M.E.|title=Autoimmunity at a glance.|journal=Autoimmunity Reviewssiews|volume=1|page=1|year=2002|doi=10.1016/S1568-9972(01)00011-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth has also led to a greater characterization of what autoimmunity is and how it can be studied and treated. With an increased amount of research, there has been tremendous growth in the study of the several different ways in which autoimmunity can occur, one of which is molecular mimicry. The mechanism by which pathogens have evolved, or obtained by chance, similar [[amino acid]] sequences or the homologous three-dimensional crystal structure of immunodominant [[epitopes]] remains a mystery.

== Immunological tolerance ==

Tolerance is a fundamental property of the [[immune system]]. Tolerance involves non-self discrimination which is the ability of the normal immune system to recognize and respond to foreign antigens, but not self antigens. Autoimmunity is evoked when this tolerance to self antigen is broken.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abbas, A.K. and Lichtman, A.H. (1995).|title=Cellular and Molecular Immunology: Updated edition|pages=216–217|publisher=Elsevier. Philadelphia, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolerance within an individual is normally evoked as a [[fetus]]. This is known as maternal-fetal tolerance where B cells expressing receptors specific for a particular antigen enter the circulation of the developing fetus via the placenta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Trowsdale, J.  |author2=Betz, A.G.|title= Mother's little helpers: mechanisms of maternal-fetal tolerance.|journal=Nature Immunology|volume=7|pages=241–246|year=2006|doi= 10.1038/ni1317|pmid=16482172|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After pre-B cells leave the bone marrow where they are synthesized, they are moved to the [[bone marrow]] where the maturation of B cells occurs. It is here where the first wave of B cell tolerance arises. Within the bone marrow, pre-B cells will encounter various self and foreign antigens present in the thymus that enter the thymus from peripheral sites via the [[circulatory system]]. Within the thymus, pre-T cells undergo a selection process where they must be positively selected and should avoid negative selection. B cells that bind with low [[avidity]] to self-MHC receptors are '''positively selected''' for maturation, those that do not die by [[apoptosis]]. Cells that survive positive selection, but bind strongly to self-antigens are '''negatively selected''' also by active induction of apoptosis. This negative selection is known as [[clonal deletion]], one of the mechanisms for B cell tolerance. Approximately 99 percent of pre-B cells within the thymus are negatively selected. Only approximately 1 percent are positively selected for maturity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leech, S.|title= Molecular mimicry in autoimmune disease|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|volume=79|pages=448–451|year=1998|doi=10.1136/adc.79.5.448|pmid=10193262|issue=5|pmc=1717758}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:3_ways_for_T_cell_tolerance2.DL.JPG|thumb|Three ways in which T cell tolerance can occur.]] --&gt;

However, there is only a limited repertoire of antigen that B cells can encounter within the thymus. B cell tolerance then must occur within the periphery after the induction of B cell tolerance within the thymus as a more diverse group of antigens can be encountered in peripheral tissues. This same positive and negative selection mechanism, but in peripheral tissues, is known as clonal [[anergy]]. The mechanism of clonal anergy is important to maintain tolerance to many autologous antigens. Active suppression is the other known mechanism of T cell tolerance. Active suppression involves the injection of large amounts of foreign antigen in the absence of an [[adjuvant]] which leads to a state of unresponsiveness. This unresponsive state is then transferred to a naïve recipient from the injected donor to induce a state of tolerance within the recipient.&lt;ref name="ref6"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pelanda, R., Schwers, S., Sonoda, E., Torres, R.M., Nemazee, D. and [[Klaus Rajewsky|Rajewsky, K.]]|title=Receptor editing in a transgenic mouse model: site, efficiency, and role in B cell tolerance and antibody diversification|journal=Immunity|volume=7|pages=765–775|year=1997|doi=10.1016/S1074-7613(00)80395-7|pmid=9430222|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolerance is also produced in T cells. There are also various processes which lead to B cell tolerance. Just as in T cells, clonal deletion and clonal anergy can physically eliminate autoreactive B cell clones. Receptor editing is another mechanism for B cell tolerance. This involves the reactivation or maintenance of [[V(D)J recombination]] in the cell which leads to the expression of novel receptor specificity through V region gene rearrangements which will create variation in the heavy and light [[immunoglobulin]] (Ig) chains.&lt;ref name="ref6"/&gt;

== Autoimmunity ==

Autoimmunity can thus be defined simply as exceptions to the tolerance "rules." By doing this, an immune response is generated against self-tissue and cells. These mechanisms are known by many to be intrinsic. However, there are [[pathogenic]] mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune disease. Pathogens can induce autoimmunity by polyclonal activation of B or T cells, or increased expression of [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) class I or II molecules. There are several ways in which a pathogen can cause an autoimmune response. A pathogen may contain a protein that acts as a [[mitogen]] to encourage cell division, thus causing more B or T cell clones to be produced. Similarly, a pathogenic [[protein]] may act as a [[superantigen]] which causes rapid polyclonal activation of B or T cells. Pathogens can also cause the release of [[cytokines]] resulting in the activation of B or T cells, or they can alter [[macrophage]] function. Finally, pathogens may also expose B or T cells to cryptic determinants, which are self antigen determinants that have not been processed and presented sufficiently to tolerize the developing T cells in the thymus and are presented at the periphery where the infection occurs.&lt;ref name="ref7"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Karlsen, A.E.  |author2=Dyrberg, T.|title=Molecular mimicry between non-self, modified self and self in autoimmunity|journal=Seminars in Immunology|volume=10|pages=25–34|year=1998|doi=10.1006/smim.1997.0102|pmid=9529653|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Molecular mimicry has been characterized as recently as the 1970s as another mechanism by which a pathogen can generate autoimmunity. Molecular mimicry is defined as similar structures shared by molecules from dissimilar genes or by their protein products. Either the linear amino acid sequence or the conformational fit of the immunodominant epitope may be shared between the pathogen and host. This is also known as "[[cross-reactivity]]" between self antigen of the host and immunodominant epitopes of the pathogen. An autoimmune response is then generated against the epitope. Due to similar sequence homology in the epitope between the pathogen and the host, cells and tissues of the host associated with the protein are destroyed as a result of the autoimmune response.&lt;ref name="ref7" /&gt;

== Probability of mimicry events ==

The prerequisite for molecular mimicry to occur is thus the sharing of the immunodominant epitope between the pathogen and the immunodominant self sequence that is generated by a cell or tissue. However, due to the amino acid variation between different proteins, molecular mimicry should not happen from a probability standpoint. Assuming five to six amino acid residues are used to induce a monoclonal antibody response, the probability of 20 amino acids occurring in six identical residues between two proteins is 1 in 20&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; or 1 in 64,000,000. However, there has been evidence shown and documented of many molecular mimicry events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Oldstone, M.B.A.|title= Molecular mimicry and immune-mediated diseases|journal=FASEB J.|volume=12|pages=1255–1265|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine which epitopes are shared between pathogen and self, large protein databases are used. The largest protein database in the world, known as the [[UniProt]] database (formerly SwissProt), has shown reports of molecular mimicry becoming more common with expansion of the database. The database currently contains 1.5 X 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; residues. The probability of finding a perfect match with a motif of 5 amino acids in length is 1 in 3.7 X 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; (0.055).&lt;!--is it really to power -7 --&gt; Therefore, within the SwissProt database, one would expect to find 1.5 X 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; X 3.7 X 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; = 5 matches. However, there are sequence motifs within the database that are overrepresented and are found more than 5 times. For example, the QKRAA sequence is an amino acid motif in the third hypervariable region of HLA-DRB1*0401. This motif is also expressed on numerous other proteins, such as on gp110 of the [[Epstein-Barr virus]] and in ''[[E. coli]]''. This motif occurs 37 times in the database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Roudier, C., Auger, I. and Roudier, J.|title=Molecular mimicry reflected through database screening: serendipity or survival strategy?|journal=Immunology Today|volume=17|pages=357–358|year=1996|doi=10.1016/0167-5699(96)30021-2|pmid=8783494|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would suggest that the linear amino acid sequence may not be an underlying cause of molecular mimicry since it can be found numerous times within the database. The possibility exists, then, for variability within amino acid sequence, but similarity in three-dimensional structure between two peptides can be recognized by T cell clones. This, therefore, uncovers a flaw of such large databases. They may be able to give a hint to relationships between epitopes, but the important three-dimensional structure cannot yet be searched for in such a database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wildner, G.  |author2=Thurau, S.R.|title=Database screening for molecular mimicry|journal=Immunology Today|volume=18|pages=252–253|year=1997|doi=10.1016/S0167-5699(97)90086-4|pmid=9153959|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structural mimicry ==

Despite no obvious amino acid sequence similarity from pathogen to host factors, structural studies have revealed that mimicry can still occur at the host level. In some cases, pathogenic mimics can possess a structural architecture that differs markedly from that of the functional homologues. Therefore, proteins of dissimilar sequence may have a common structure which elicits an autoimmune response. It has been hypothesized that these virulent proteins display their mimicry through molecular surfaces that mimic host protein surfaces (protein fold or three-dimensional conformation), which have been obtained by [[convergent evolution]]. It has also been theorized that these similar protein folds have been obtained by [[horizontal gene transfer]], most likely from a [[eukaryotic]] host. This further supports the theory that microbial organisms have evolved a mechanism of concealment similar to that of higher organisms such as the African [[praying mantis]] or [[chameleon]] who camouflage themselves so that they can mimic their background as not to be recognized by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stebbins, C.E.  |author2=Galan, J.E.|title=Structural mimicry in bacterial virulence|journal=Nature|volume=412|pages=701–705|year=2001|doi=10.1038/35089000|pmid=11507631|issue=6848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite dissimilar sequence homology between self and foreign peptide, weak [[electrostatic interactions]] between foreign peptide and the MHC can also mimic self peptide to elicit an autoimmune response within the host. For example, charged residues can explain the enhanced on-rate and reduced off-rate of a particular antigen or can contribute to a higher affinity and activity for a particular antigen that can perhaps mimic that of the host. Similarly, prominent ridges on the floor of peptide-binding grooves can do such things as create C-terminal bulges in particular peptides that can greatly increase the interaction between foreign and self peptide on the MHC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Speir, J.A., Garcia, K.C., Brunmark, A., Degano, M., Peterson, P.A., Teyton, L. and Wilson, I.A.|title=Structural basis of 2C TCR allorecognition of H-2Ld peptide complexes|journal=Immunity|volume=8|pages=553–562|year=1998|doi=10.1016/S1074-7613(00)80560-9|pmid=9620676|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there has been evidence that even gross features such as acidic/basic and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions have allowed foreign peptides to interact with an antibody or MHC and TCR. It is now apparent that sequence similarity considerations are not sufficient when evaluating potential mimic epitopes and the underlying mechanisms of molecular mimicry. Molecular mimicry, from these examples, has therefore been shown to occur in the absence of any true sequence homology.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

There has been increasing evidence for mimicking events caused not only by amino acid similarities but also in similarities in binding motifs to the MHC. Molecular mimicry is thus occurring between two recognized peptides that have similar antigenic surfaces in the absence of primary sequence homology. For example, specific single amino acid residues such as [[cysteine]] (creates di-sulfide bonds), [[arginine]] or [[lysine]] (form multiple hydrogen bonds), could be essential for T cell cross-reactivity. These single residues may be the only residues conserved between self and foreign antigen that allow the structurally similar but sequence non-specific peptides to bind to the MHC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Quartino, S., Thorpe, C.J., Travers, P.J. and Londei, M.|title=Similar antigenic surfaces, rather than sequence homology, dictate T-cell epitope molecular mimicry|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA|volume=92|pages=10398–10402|year=1995|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.22.10398|pmid=7479792|issue=22|pmc=40804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epitope spreading ==

Epitope spreading, also known as determinant spreading, is another common way in which autoimmunity can occur which uses the molecular mimicry mechanism. Autoreactive T cells are activated ''de novo'' by self epitopes released secondary to pathogen-specific T cell-mediated bystander damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehmann|first=Paul V.|last2=Forsthuber|first2=Thomas|last3=Miller|first3=Alexander|last4=Sercarz|first4=Eli E.|date=1992-07-09|title=Spreading of T-cell autoimmunity to cryptic determinants of an autoantigen|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v358/n6382/abs/358155a0.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=358|issue=6382|pages=155–157|doi=10.1038/358155a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; T cell responses to progressively less dominant epitopes are activated as a consequence of the release of other antigens secondary to the destruction of the pathogen with a homologous immunodominant sequence. Thus, inflammatory responses induced by specific pathogens that trigger pro-inflammatory T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;1 responses have the ability to persist in genetically susceptible hosts. This may lead to organ-specific autoimmune disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Miller, S.D., Vanderlugt, C.L., Begolka, W.S., Pao, W., Yauch, R.L., Neville, K.L., Katz-Levy, Y., Carrizosa, A. and Kim, B.S.|title=Persistent infection with Theiler's virus leads to CNS autoimmunity via epitope spreading|journal=Nature Medicine|volume=3|pages=1133–1136|year=1997|doi=10.1038/nm1097-1133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, epitope spreading could be due to target antigens being physically linked intracellularly as members of a complex to self antigen. The result of this is an autoimmune response that is triggered by exogenous antigen that progresses to a truly autoimmune response against mimicked self antigen and other antigens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davies, J.M.|title=Introduction: epitope mimicry as a component cause of autoimmune disease|journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences|volume=57|pages=523–526|year=2000|doi=10.1007/PL00000713|pmid=11130451|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these examples, it is clear that the search for candidate mimic epitopes must extend beyond the immunodominant epitopes of a given autoimmune response.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

== Implications in human disease ==

===Diseases of the central nervous system===

The [[HIV-1]] virus has been shown to cause diseases of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) in humans through a molecular mimicry apparatus. HIV-1 [[gp41]] is used to bind [[chemokines]] on the cell surface of the host so that the [[virion]] may gain entrance into the host. [[Astrocytes]] are cells of the CNS which are used to regulate the concentrations of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [[neurotransmitter]] which enter the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) to contribute to the [[blood brain barrier]]. A twelve amino acid sequence (Leu-Gly-Ile-Trp-Gly-Cys-Ser-Gly-Lys-Leu-Ile-Cys) on gp41 of the HIV-1 virus (immunodominant region) shows sequence homology with a twelve amino acid protein on the surface of human astrocytes. Antibodies are produced for the HIV-1 gp41 protein. These antibodies can cross-react with astrocytes within human CNS tissue and act as [[autoantibodies]]. This contributes to many CNS complications found in [[AIDS]] patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yamada, M., Zurbriggen, A., Oldstone, M.B.A. and Fujinami, R.S.|title=Common immunologic determinant between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp41 and astrocytes|journal=Journal of Virology|volume=65|pages=1370–1376|year=1991|pmid=1704927|issue=3|pmc=239914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) leads to the development in mice of a progressive CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell-mediated response after these cells have infiltrated the CNS. This virus has been shown to cause CNS disease in  mice that resembles multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease in humans that results in the gradual destruction of the [[myelin]] sheath coating [[axons]] of the CNS. The TMEV mouse virus shares a thirteen amino acid sequence (His-Cys-Leu-Gly-Lys-Trp-Leu-Gly-His-Pro-Asp-Lys-Phe) (PLP ([[proteolipid protein]]) 139-151 epitope) with that of a human myelin-specific epitope. Bystander myelin damage is caused by virus specific T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;1 cells that cross react with this self epitope. To test the efficacy in which TMEV uses molecular mimicry to its advantage, a sequence of the human myelin-specific epitope was inserted into a non-pathogenic TMEV variant. As a result, there was a CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell response and autoimmune demyelination was initiated by infection with a TMEV peptide ligand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Olson, J.K, Croxford, J.L., Calenoff, M.A., Dal Canto, M.C. and Miller, S.D.|title=A virus-induced molecular mimicry model of multiple sclerosis|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|volume=108|pages=311–318|year=2001|pmid=11457884|issue=2|doi=10.1172/JCI13032|pmc=203030}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, it has recently been shown that there are other possible targets for molecular mimicry in patients with multiple sclerosis. These involve the [[hepatitis B]] virus mimicking the human proteolipid protein (myelin protein) and the Epstein-Barr virus mimicking anti-[[myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein]] (contributes to a ring of myelin around blood vessels).&lt;ref name="ref18"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Oleszak, E.L., Chang, J.R., Friedman, H., Katsetos, C.D. and Platsoucas, C.D. |title=Theiler's Virus Infection: a Model for Multiple Sclerosis|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|volume=17|pages=174–207|year=2004 |doi=10.1128/CMR.17.1.174-207.2004|pmid=14726460|issue=1|pmc=321460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muscle disorders===

[[Myasthenia gravis]] is another common autoimmune disease. This disease causes fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue. The disease occurs due to detectable antibodies produced against the human [[acetylcholine receptor]]. The receptor contains a seven amino acid sequence (Trp-Thr-Tyr-Asp-Gly-Thr-Lys)&lt;ref name="ref18" /&gt; in the α-subunit that demonstrates immunological cross-reactivity with a shared immunodominant domain of gpD of the [[herpes simplex virus]] (HSV). Similar to HIV-1, gpD also aids in binding to chemokines on the cell surface of the host to gain entry into the host. Cross-reactivity of the self epitope (α-subunit of the receptor) with antibodies produced against HSV suggests that the virus is associated with the initiation of myasthenia gravis. Not only does HSV cause immunologic cross-reactivity, but the gpD peptide also competitively inhibits the binding of antibody made against the α-subunit to its corresponding peptide on the α-subunit. Despite this, an autoimmune response still occurs. This further shows an immunologically significant sequence homology to the biologically active site of the human acetylcholine receptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schwimmbeck, P.L., Dyrberg, T., Drachman, D.B. and Oldstone, M.B.A.|title=Molecular mimicry and myasthenia gravis. An autoantigenic site of the acetylcholine receptor alpha-subunit that has biologic activity and reacts immunochemically with herpes simplex virus|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|volume=84|pages=1174–1180|year=1989|pmid=2551924|issue=4|doi=10.1172/JCI114282|pmc=329775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Control ==

There are ways in which autoimmunity caused by molecular mimicry can be avoided. Control of the initiating factor (pathogen) via vaccination seems to be the most common method to avoid autoimmunity. Inducing tolerance to the host autoantigen in this way may also be the most stable factor. The development of a downregulating immune response to the shared epitope between pathogen and host may be the best way of treating an autoimmune disease caused by molecular mimicry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barnett, L.A.  |author2=Fujinami, R.S.|title=Molecular mimicry: a mechanism for autoimmunity|journal=FASEB J.|volume=6|pages=840–844|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, treatment with [[immunosuppressive drugs]] such as [[ciclosporin]] and [[azathioprine]] has also been used as a possible solution. However, in many cases this has been shown to be ineffective because cells and tissues have already been destroyed at the onset of the infection.&lt;ref name="ref3" /&gt;

== Conclusion ==

The concept of molecular mimicry is a useful tool in understanding the [[etiology]], [[pathogenesis]], treatment, and prevention of autoimmune disorders. Molecular mimicry is, however, only one mechanism by which an autoimmune disease can occur in association with a pathogen. Understanding the mechanisms of molecular mimicry may allow future research to be directed toward uncovering the initiating infectious agent as well as recognizing the self determinant. This way, future research may be able to design strategies for treatment and prevention of autoimmune disorders. The use of transgenic models such as those used for discovery of the mimicry events leading to diseases of the CNS and muscle disorders has helped evaluate the sequence of events leading to molecular mimicry.

==History==

In early 1981, several member companies of NEMA began studying how to prevent young children from being electrocuted by electrical transformers. This followed incidents where transformer cabinets were vandalized or left unlocked, allowing access to the high-voltage equipment inside and resulting in disfigurement and death. NEMA realized that existing signage did not adequately convey the danger, either because it required literacy (text-only warnings) or because it was too abstract to register on a child (bolts of electricity).

Concerned about "failure to warn" lawsuits, NEMA began exploring ways of warning young children about the dangers of exposed high-voltage equipment.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Member companies within NEMA's Transformer Section formed a task force—the Task Force on Safety Labels for Pad-Mounted Switchgear and Transformers Sited in Public Areas—to design a safety label that very young children would understand, as well as standards on how that label was to be used.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

At the beginning of the project, the task force reached out to transformer manufacturers in an effort to build consensus for standardizing a design. NEMA hired the Agnew Moyer Smith company of Pittsburgh, PA to design the label, and the George R. Fraich Associates Testing Organization of Chicago to test children's reactions to it. NEMA began testing the first iterations of the design in late 1981, initially choosing sixteen different illustrations to test on children. The test groups were located in Chicago, IL and San Antonio, Texas, and consisted of an equal number of English and non-English-speaking children, aged 2.5 to 6 years old. From that group of sixteen illustrations, NEMA selected the four most successful designs and conducted a second round of user tests in early 1982, using a group of children located in Chicago and identical in age range and language. Of those four illustrations, the one children most strongly associated with danger was Mr. Ouch. A 1995 study presented at the annual meeting of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society confirmed that Mr. Ouch most effectively suggested an electrical hazard, out of four other symbols. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Mr. Ouch label designs shown in the 1996 revision of NEMA-260 share many characteristics of OSHA's current ANSI-Z535-based safety standards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| access-date = 2016-02-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;—clear pictogram, caution symbol, and direct explanatory language—and NEMA-260-1996 does not specify that Mr. Ouch labels must be used in accordance with other signage.

Wisconsin Energies created an educational video for schools, to help children recognize Mr. Ouch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=pacificacreative|title=Mr. Ouch Kids Video|date=2010-02-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck1BuRg71nM|accessdate=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ovarian diseases''' are conditions that happen to young women and can affect their reproductive system and general health. 

These can be classified as [[endocrine disorder]]s or as a disorders of the [[reproductive system]].

If the egg fails to release from the [[Ovarian follicle|follicle]] in the [[ovary]] an [[ovarian cyst]] may form. Small [[Ovarian cyst|ovarian cysts]] are common in healthy women. Some women have more follicles than usual ([[polycystic ovary syndrome]]), which inhibits the follicles to grow normally and this will cause cycle irregularities. 

There are various types of ovarian diseases. Some of the ovarian diseases or disorders are:

# [[Endometriosis]].
# [[Ovarian cyst|Ovarian cysts]].
# [[Ovarian cancer|Ovarian Epithelial Cancer]].
# Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors.
# Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors.
# Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).

== Endometriosis ==
[[Endometriosis]] is a condition in which tissues lining the uterus grows abnormally beyond the uterus that may become quite painful. In simpler terms, it means that the tissue lining the uterus develops in different parts outside of it. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/149109.php|title=Endometriosis: Symptoms, causes, and treatments|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Causes''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometriosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354656|title=Endometriosis - Symptoms and causes|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

There is no exact cause of endometriosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/149109.php|title=Endometriosis: Symptoms, causes, and treatments|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Symptoms: 

Menstrual cramps, heavy menstrual bleeding, bowel or urinary problems, nausea, vomiting, blood with stools, painful intercourse, fatigues, spotting or bleeding between periods. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/149109.php|title=Endometriosis: Symptoms, causes, and treatments|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment:

# Surgery at extreme situations
# Hormonal treatments using birth controls.
# Healthier lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/149109.php|title=Endometriosis: Symptoms, causes, and treatments|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ovarian Cysts ==
It is common for many women to develop one cyst in their lifetime[https://www.healthline.com/health/ovarian-cysts#types]. At times, these can go unnoticed without pain or visible symptoms. A cyst may develop in either of the ovaries that are responsible for producing hormones and carrying eggs in the bodies of women. Ovarian cysts can be of various types like [[Dermoid cyst|dermoid cysts,]] endometrioma cysts and the [[Ovarian cyst|functional cyst]] being the most common one [https://www.healthline.com/health/ovarian-cysts#types]

Symptoms:

# Abdominal bloating or swelling.
# Painful bowel movement.
# Pelvic pain before or after the menstrual cycle.
# Painful intercourse.
# Pain in the lower back or thighs.
# Breast tenderness.
# Nausea and vomiting. 
# Fever.
# Rapid breathing.
# Faintness or dizziness.
# Sharp pelvic pain.

Treatment:

# Taking of [[Oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]] or birth control pills as prescribed by the doctor.
# [[Laparoscopy|Laparoscopy:]] Surgery to remove the cyst.
# [[Hysterectomy]] in case the cyst is cancerous. 

== Ovarian Epithelial Cancer ==
It is one of the common ovarian cancers that affect women worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.webmd.com/ovarian-cancer/ovarian-epithelial-cancer#1|title=What Is Ovarian Epithelial Cancer?|work=WebMD|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It develops outside the ovaries and ultimately spreads outside and can affect other organs. 

Causes:

It may happen if there is a family medical history of [[Breast cancer|breast cancer,]] [[Colon cancer staging|colon cancer,]] [[rectal cancer]] or [[uterine cancer]], [[Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer|Lynch syndrome]]. If someone is under the [[Hormone replacement therapy|Estrogen Replacement Therapy]] for a long time. Smoking habits may also lead to the same. [https://www.webmd.com/ovarian-cancer/ovarian-epithelial-cancer#1]

Symptoms:

Symptoms are not very clear and for most of them, it comes to notice when it spreads throughout the abdomen. 

Treatment:

# Surgery to remove the womb.
# [[Chemotherapy]].

== Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors ==
Ovarian germ cell tumors are common among teenagers and young women. It is a growth in the ovaries. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK65925/]

Causes:

Though the exact causes are not known, it may happen owing to certain birth defects affecting the genitals, nervous system or the urinary tract. There may be genetic conditions affecting the sex chromosomes that result in these kind of tumors as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board|title=Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors Treatment (PDQ®): Patient Version|date=2002|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK65925/|work=PDQ Cancer Information Summaries|publisher=National Cancer Institute (US)|pmid=26389363|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms

# Belly swelling.
# Pain or pressure in the belly.
# Swollen abdomen. 
# Vaginal bleeding after [[Menopause|menopause.]] 

Treatment:

# Surgery to remove the tumor, or the [[Fallopian tube|Fallopian tubes]] or one or more ovaries.
# Hysterectomy. 
# Chemotherapy in case the tumor is cancerous.
# [[Radiation therapy]] to prevent the cancerous cells from developing.

== Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors ==
The tumor forms in the ovaries and gradually spreads to the outside of ovary. This mostly affects younger women and also hinders the reproductive system. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.webmd.com/ovarian-cancer/ovarian-low-malignant-potential-tumors#1|title=What Are Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors?|work=WebMD|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Causes:

Causes are debatable and these may occur to both pregnant women and women who do not opt for pregnancy 

Symptoms:

# Belly pain or swelling.
# Bowel problems or constipation.

Treatment:

Depending on the size of the tumor, choice of pregnancy, the spreading of the tumor, age and choices, removing the affected ovary is the most common treatment. In rare situations, the tumor is taken out of the ovary. Also, hysterectomy can be an option. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.webmd.com/ovarian-cancer/ovarian-low-malignant-potential-tumors#1|title=What Are Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors?|work=WebMD|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) ==
This is a condition where the hormone levels in a woman’s body get affected leading to more amounts of male hormones than needed. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/polycystic-ovary-disease|title=Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment|work=Healthline|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Causes:

The increased level of hormones may result in irregular menstrual cycle and diabetes and heart problem in the long run. It also affects the body in various ways like problem getting pregnant, sleep apnea, depression and anxiety, can enhance the risk of endometrial cancer. 

Symptoms:

# Irregular periods.
# Heavy bleeding during periods.
# Excess hair growth on face and other parts of the body like chest, back, belly.
# Acne.
# Gain of weight. 
# Darkening of skin. 
# Headaches. 

Treatment: 

# Taking of birth control pills for getting regular periods prescribed by the doctor.
# Healthier lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pcos/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353443|title=Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) - Diagnosis and treatment - Mayo Clinic|website=www.mayoclinic.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''polyclinic''' is a [[clinic]] that provides both general and specialist examinations and treatments to [[outpatient]]s and is usually independent of a hospital. The term is not clearly defined and includes:

* [[Polyclinics in England]], large health care centres able to provide a wider range of services than a standard doctor's (GP) office, an initiative of [[Ara Darzi|Ara Darzi, Baron Darzi of Denham]] in 2007.
* [[The Polyclinic]], in Seattle, Washington, US

==See also==
* [[Outpatient clinic (hospital department)|Outpatient department of a hospital]] (rarely called ''policlinic'' in American English, and only when referring to European hospital outpatient departments)
* [[District general hospital|General hospital]]; when a polyclinic is so large that it is in fact a hospital, it is also called a general hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/polyclinic polyclinic] in Collins English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3808">In [[obstetrics]], '''position''' is the orientation of the [[fetus]] in the [[womb]], identified by the location of the [[presentation (obstetrics)|presenting part]] of the fetus relative to the [[human pelvis|pelvis]] of the mother. Conventionally, it is the position assumed by the fetus before the process of birth, as the fetus assumes various positions and postures during the course of [[childbirth]].

== Positions ==
Depending upon which part of the fetus is expected to be delivered first (fetal presentation), there are many possible positions:
* [[Vertex presentation]] with longitudinal lie:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name
! Abb.
! Description
|-
| '''Left occipitoanterior'''
| LOA
| [[occiput]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;'''Occiput''' is the prominence of the back of the head&lt;/ref&gt; as against the buttocks, is close to the vagina (hence known as vertex presentation) faces anteriorly (forward with mother standing) and towards left. This is the most common position and lie.
|-
| '''Right occipitoanterior''' 
| ROA
| occiput faces anteriorly and towards right. Less common than LOA, but not associated with labor complications.
|-
| '''Left occipitoposterior'''
| 
| occiput faces posteriorly (behind) and towards left.
|-
| '''Right occipitoposterior'''
| ROP
| occiput faces posteriorly and towards right.
|-
| '''Occipitoanterior'''
| 
| occiput faces anteriorly (absolutely straight without any turning to any of the sides)
|-
| '''Occipitoposterior'''
| 
| occiput faces posteriorly (absolutely straight without any turning to any of the sides)
|-
| '''Left occipitotransverse'''
| LOT
| occiput faces left
|-
| '''Right occipitotransverse'''
| ROT
| occiput faces right
|}

* [[Breech presentation]] with longitudinal lie:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Kish|first= Karen|author2=Joseph V. Collea|editor= Alan H.

#'''Left [[sacrum]] anterior''' (LSA)&amp;mdash;the buttocks, as against the occiput of the vertex presentation, like close to the vagina (hence known as breech presentation), which lie anteriorly and towards the left.
#'''Right sacrum anterior''' (RSA)&amp;mdash;the buttocks face anteriorly and towards the right.

#'''Right sacrum posterior''' (RSP)&amp;mdash;the buttocks face posteriorly and towards right.
#'''Sacrum anterior''' (SA)&amp;mdash;the buttocks face anteriorly.
#'''Sacrum posterior''' (SP)&amp;mdash;the buttocks face posteriorly.

* [[Shoulder presentation]] with transverse lie are classified into four types, based on the location of the [[scapula]] (shoulderblade); note: the presentation is significantly different from [[Asynclitic birth|asynclitic positioning]], and in most cases needs to be delivered by [[cesarean section]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15727">'''Premature thelarche''' (PT) is a [[medical condition]], characterised by isolated [[breast development]] in female infants. It occurs in females younger than 8 years, with the highest occurrence before the age of 2. PT is rare, occurring in 2.2-4.7% of females aged 0 to 2 years old.&lt;ref name="Khokar_2018"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Khokar | first1 = Aditi | last2 = Mojia | first2 = Angela | name-list-format = vanc |date=2018|title=Premature Thelarche|journal=Pediatric Annals|volume=47.1|pages=12–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact cause of the condition is still unknown, but it has been linked to a variety of [[Genetics|genetic]], [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] and [[Physiology|physiological]] factors.&lt;ref name="Rezkalla_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rezkalla J, Von Wald T, Hansen KA | title = Premature Thelarche and the PURA Syndrome | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 129 | issue = 6 | pages = 1037–1039 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28486374 | doi = 10.1097/AOG.0000000000002047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PT is a form of Incomplete Precocious Puberty (IPP). IPP is the presence of a [[secondary sex characteristic]] in an infant, without a change in their [[Sex steroid|sex hormone]] levels. [[Central precocious puberty|Central Precocious Puberty]] (CPP) is a more severe condition than IPP. CPP is the presentation of secondary sex characteristics, with a change in sex hormones due to alteration of the [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis]].&lt;ref name="Khokar_2018" /&gt;{{Infobox medical condition (new)

}}CPP is an aggressive [[Endocrine disease|endocrine disorder]] with harmful developmental consequences for the patient. At the presentation of PT, [[Diagnosis|diagnostics]] are used to ensure it isn’t early stage CPP. CPP can be differentiated from PT through biochemical testing, [[ultrasound]]s and ongoing [[Medical observation|observation]].&lt;ref name="Lee_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee SH, Joo EY, Lee JE, Jun YH, Kim MY | title = The Diagnostic Value of Pelvic Ultrasound in Girls with Central Precocious Puberty | language = English | journal = Chonnam Medical Journal | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 70–4 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26866003 | pmc = 4742613 | doi = 10.4068/cmj.2016.52.1.70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no treatment for PT but regular observation is important to ensure it doesn’t progress to CPP. CPP diagnosis is important as treatment is necessary.&lt;ref name="Khokar_2018" /&gt;

== Symptoms ==
Premature thelarche is [[Hypertrophy|breast hypertrophy]] before puberty. This form of hypertrophy is an increase in [[Breast|breast tissue]]. PT occurs in [[Child|pre-pubecent]] females, under the age of 8, having a peak occurrence in the first two years of life.&lt;ref name="Sømod_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sømod ME, Vestergaard ET, Kristensen K, Birkebæk NH | title = Increasing incidence of premature thelarche in the Central Region of Denmark - Challenges in differentiating girls less than 7 years of age with premature thelarche from girls with precocious puberty in real-life practice | journal = International Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology | volume = 2016 | issue = 1 | pages = 4 | date = 2016-02-22 | pmid = 26909102 | pmc = 4763410 | doi = 10.1186/s13633-016-0022-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The breast development is usually [[Bilateralism|bi-lateral]]: both breasts show development. In some cases development may be [[Unilateralism|unilateral]]: one breast develops.

=== Patterns of PT ===
There are four [[Patterns in nature|patterns]] of PT development. Most patients have hypertrophy followed by complete loss of the excess breast tissue  (51% of cases) or loss of most excess tissue, but some remains until puberty (36% of cases). Less commonly patients have ongoing patterns of thelarche: 9.7% suffer from a cyclic pattern where the size of the breast tissue varies over time, and 3.2% experience continual increase in tissue size.&lt;ref name="Khokar_2018" /&gt;

=== Associated Symptoms ===
The main symptom of PT is enlarged breast tissue in infants. [[Estrogen|Estrogen’s]] role in PT, also leads to increased [[bone age]] and [[Bone growth|growth]] in some cases.&lt;ref name="Codner_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Codner E, Román R | title = Premature thelarche from phenotype to genotype | journal = Pediatric Endocrinology Reviews | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 760–5 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18367996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In PT these [[Symptom|secondary symptoms]] are minimal: bone age only varies from actual age by a few months and growth velocity only slightly varies from the norm. [[Medical test|Diagnostic tests]] will distinguish these PT secondary symptoms from the more severe bone aging and growth occurring in early [[Precocious puberty|CPP]].&lt;ref name="Lee_2016" /&gt;

== Pathophysiology ==
The direct [[pathophysiology]] behind PT is still unknown, but there are many postulated causes.&lt;ref name="Rezkalla_2017" /&gt;

=== Estrogen ===
PT is linked to increased sensitivity of the breast tissue to [[estradiol]], an [[estrogen]] derivative, in certain [[Preadolescence|prepubertal]] individuals.&lt;ref name="Khokar_2018" /&gt; Sporadic estrogen or estradiol production in the [[adrenal gland]]s, [[Ovarian follicle|follicles]] or [[ovarian cyst]]s is also linked to the condition.&lt;ref name="Rezkalla_2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dundar_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dundar B, Pirgon O, Sangun O, Doguc DK | title = Elevated leptin levels in nonobese girls with premature thelarche | journal = Journal of Investigative Medicine | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pages = 984–8 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23838698 | doi = 10.2310/JIM.0b013e31829cbe20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Follicle stimulating hormone ===
[[Follicle-stimulating hormone|Follicle Stimulating Hormone]] (FSH) is secreted from the [[anterior pituitary]]. FSH plays a key role in development, growth and puberty, thus it is suspected to play a role in PT. [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|Gondotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) stimulation testing in some patients with PT has shown a dominant response from FSH. This response is linked to [[Mutation|active mutations]] in the [[Follicle-stimulating hormone receptor|FSH receptor]] and [[Gs alpha subunit|Gs-a subunit]] in PT. [[Genetic testing|Genetic investigation]] indicated these mutations only account for few cases of premature PT.&lt;ref name="Rezkalla_2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Román_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Román R, Johnson MC, Codner E, Boric MA, áVila A, Cassorla F | title = Activating GNAS1 gene mutations in patients with premature thelarche | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 145 | issue = 2 | pages = 218–22 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15289771 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpeds.2004.05.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PT may also be caused by transient partial activation of the [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis|HPG axis]]. Partial activation would release a surplus of FSH from the anterior pituitary without further disruption of the HPG axis.&lt;ref name="Dundar_2013" /&gt;

=== Other causes ===
The consumption or exposure to certain [[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine disrupters]] have also been linked to PT.&lt;ref name="Rezkalla_2017" /&gt;

== CPP and PT ==
PT is the [[Benign tumor|benign growth]] of breasts in infants, while [[Precocious puberty|CPP]] is a condition that involves the frequent activation of the [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis|HPG axis]] in patients.  PT does not require treatment, as the condition is limited to enlarged breast tissue that usually subsides with time. CPP is associated with a wider range of symptoms including [[thelarche]], pubic hair growth, [[Bone age|accelerated bone aging]], increased growth velocity and [[Epiphyseal plate|early epiphyseal growth]]. If an individual is affected with CPP they will need to begin treatment immediately. CPP is treated with [[Luteinizing hormone|lutenizing hormone]] (LH) releasing hormone agonists. PT can impact growth velocity and bone age slightly, but CPP affects these characteristics to the point of detriment to the [[Human height|adult stature]].&lt;ref name="Khokar_2018" /&gt; Patients with suspected PT must undergo [[Medical test|diagnostic]] testing to ensure it isn’t CPP or exaggerated thelarche, the intermediate stage before CPP.&lt;ref name="Lee_2016" /&gt;

Notable hormone differences occur between CPP and PT patients, so studying these hormone levels is the main biochemical diagnostic used in CPP.&lt;ref name="Sømod_2016" /&gt; Individuals with CPP usually have a higher basal LH levels and LH:FSH ratios.&lt;ref name="Khokar_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sømod_2016" /&gt;

Few PT patients, 9 to 14%, are predicted to develop CPP.&lt;ref name="Khokar_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sømod_2016" /&gt; Observation allows clinicians to identify the presentation of CPP indicative symptoms in PT patients.  No diagnostics tests can indicate if a PT patient is at risk of developing CPP.&lt;ref name="Sømod_2016" /&gt;

== Diagnosis and treatment ==
Premature thelarche does not require treatment. In PT, breast [[hypertrophy]] will usually stop completely and patients will experience [[Regression toward the mean|regression]] of the breast tissue over 3 to 60 months.  Less commonly, patients may remain with residual breast tissue or continue through cycles of breast hypertrophy and regression until puberty.&lt;ref name="Khokar_2018" /&gt;

Diagnostics are utilised in individuals with PT, especially at the presentation of other secondary sex characteristics. Diagnostics aim to ensure PT patients are not suffering from [[Precocious puberty|CPP]].&lt;ref name="Khokar_2018" /&gt;

=== Pelvic Ultrasounds ===
[[Medical ultrasound|Pelvic ultrasounds]] are important in diagnosing CPP.&lt;ref name="Lee_2016" /&gt; Patients with CPP have an increased [[ovary]] and [[uterus]] size. The ovary and uterus volume of CPP patients is similar to that of females undergoing puberty.&lt;ref name="Khokar_2018" /&gt; The pelvis ultrasound is problematic as a diagnostic, as there is not a specific cut-off for the uterine and ovary volumes that indicate the patient has CPP. Patients with PT should have a uterine and ovarian volume within the normal range for their age. Pelvic ultrasounds are a desirable diagnostic as they are non-invasive and easy to continually review. The pelvic ultrasound should be paired with biochemical tests to determine the presence of CPP.&lt;ref name="Lee_2016" /&gt;

=== Biochemical tests ===
Biochemical tests study the [[Hormone|hormone levels]] in patients. CPP patients have elevated [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] levels and peak LH:[[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] ratios when compared to PT patients. It is hard to use LH as a diagnostic for CPP, as the LH assay has varying sensitivity and specificity.&lt;ref name="Khokar_2018" /&gt; The [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] stimulation test is the main diagnostic biochemical test used to distinguish PT from CPP.&lt;ref name="Lee_2016" /&gt; The GnRH test demonstrates the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary]] responsiveness to GnRH. GnRH stimulates the release of LH and FSH from the [[anterior pituitary]]. The peak LH:FSH ratio in CPP patients is similar to the ratio of pubertal females. Females with PT demonstrated a LH:FSH ratio lower than pubertal females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zevenhuijzen H, Kelnar CJ, Crofton PM | title = Diagnostic utility of a low-dose gonadotropin-releasing hormone test in the context of puberty disorders | language = english | journal = Hormone Research | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = 168–76 | date = 2004 | pmid = 15331852 | doi = 10.1159/000080324 | url = https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/80324 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The disadvantages of the GnRH stimulation test is it takes a long time to perform and requires multiple collections from the patient, making the process time consuming and inconvenient. The test is highly specific but has low sensitivity as the LH hormone response is usually observed in later stages of CPP.&lt;ref name="Lee_2016" /&gt; There are also overlaps in the expected value in the GnRH test results of individuals with CPP and PT.&lt;ref name="Khokar_2018" /&gt;

=== Combined diagnostic approach ===
The diagnostic inconsistency in CPP means that a combination of all of pelvic ultrasounds and biochemical tests should be paired with observation, to ensure PT doesn’t progress to CPP.&lt;ref name="Khokar_2018" /&gt;

== Research ==

=== Exposure to environmental agents ===
Natural commodities like [[fennel]], [[Lavender oil|lavender]] and [[tea tree oil]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have been linked to PT. Lavender and tea tree oil have weak [[estrogen]]ic activities. These estrogenic properties may cause an imbalance in [[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine signalling pathways]], leading to PT in regular users of these products.&lt;ref name="Khokar_2018" /&gt; Fennel tea has been studied as an [[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine disrupter]] linked to PT. Fennel seed oil contains [[anethole]] a compound with estrogenic effects. The tea contains fennel seed oil and regular use results in increased [[estradiol]] levels in the infant. Infants with fennel tea related PT, were given the tea as a [[Homeopathy|homeopathic remedy]] for [[Psychomotor agitation|restlessness]]. The tea was consumed for at least four months before the presentation of PT symptoms. PT resulting from fennel tea subsides approxiamately six months after stopping the use of fennel tea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Okdemir D, Hatipoglu N, Kurtoglu S, Akın L, Kendirci M | title = Premature thelarche related to fennel tea consumption? | journal = Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism | volume = 27 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 175–9 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24030028 | doi = 10.1515/jpem-2013-0308 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leptin ===
[[Leptin]] is an [[Adipocyte|adipocyte hormone]] that has important implications of puberty and [[Sex steroid|sex hormone secretion]]. Increased leptin has been linked to [[estrogen]] and estradiol secretion. Leptin has key roles in maintaining age appropriate [[body composition]] and [[Body mass index|desired weight]]. [[Leptin receptor]]s are also found in [[Epithelial cells|mammary epithelial cells]] and leptin has been observed as a [[growth factor]] in breast tissue. Increased leptin levels have been observed in some cases of PT. The increase in leptin levels cause increased estradiol levels and development of breast tissue.&lt;ref name="Dundar_2013" /&gt;

=== GNAS1 gene mutation ===
The form of PT with fluctuating hypertrophy in patients has been linked to activating mutations in the GNAS1 gene. This mutation accounts for a small number of cases of PT.&lt;ref name="Codner_2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Román_2004" /&gt;

'''Saint Louis University School of Medicine''' (SLUSOM) is a private, American [[Medical School]] within [[Saint Louis University]]. Located in the city of St. Louis, Missouri, Saint Louis University School of Medicine was established in 1836 and has the distinction of awarding the first [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degree west of the Mississippi River.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The school comprises  about 700 medical students, 550 faculty members and 550 residents in 48 graduate medical education programs including residencies, subspecialty residencies and fellowships. The School is   a pioneer in geriatric medicine, chronic disease prevention, cardiovascular disease, organ transplantation, neurosciences and vaccine research among others. It is  a leading center of research in five key areas: cancer, infectious disease, liver disease, aging and brain disorders, and heart/lung disease.

It provides health services on a local, national, and international level while conducting medical research and training physicians and biomedical scientists of the future. [[Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital]] and [[Saint Louis University Hospital]] are the two main affiliated teaching hospitals of the school.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slu.edu/x46270.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Saint Louis University School of Medicine was established in 1836 as the Medical Department of the University and had the distinction of awarding the first M.D. degree west of the Mississippi River in 1839. Several affiliated doctors of national importance include [[William Beaumont]], whose pioneering studies of the human digestive system opened a new world of research, and [[Daniel Brainerd]], who later founded [[Rush Medical College]] (then part of the University of Chicago). [[Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital]] and [[Saint Louis University Hospital]] are the two main affiliated teaching hospitals of the school.

[[File:SLU Ambulatory Care Unit.jpg|thumb|left|SLU Ambulatory Care Unit]]

The [[Know-Nothing movement]], an anti-immigrant and subsequently anti Catholic movement that surged through the United States in the 1840s and 1850s eventually led to the separation of the University's Medical Department from the University in 1854. As a result, the University was without a medical school for 59 years until the presidency of Father William Banks Rogers (1900 to 1908),  during which plans were initiated for the integration of a new medical school into the University.

In 1903, the Marion Sims-Beaumont College of Medicine was incorporated into the University. At this time, Marion Sims-Beaumont College was a medical school owned and operated by a group of St. Louis physicians. The college's decision to merge with the University was greatly influenced and reinforced by the recommendations of the Council on Medical Education and Hospitals of the [[American Medical Association]], which insisted that all schools of medicine be affiliated with a University. Assured of financial support from the St. Louis civic leader [[Festus J. Wade]], President Rogers successfully secured the needed funds for the purchase of the Marion Sims-Beaumont College.

Since 1994, the students and physicians of the School of Medicine have been committed to providing free primary healthcare services in an academic environment through their Health Resource Center. They currently operate 8 free clinics throughout the Saint Louis area including an adult clinic, pediatric clinic, well woman clinic, cardiology clinic, diabetes clinic, homeless health clinic, extended services clinic, and their most recent addition, the asthma and allergy clinic.

[[File:Doisy Research Center.jpg|thumb|right|alt=SLU Doisy Research Center|The new Doisy Research Center.]]

In 2007, a new research center was added to the university. Made of glass and steel in just 522 working days, the 10-story tower now stands at the northern gateway to the University's Medical Center. This 206,000 square-foot building is named after the late Dr. [[Edward Adelbert Doisy]], who was not only a Nobel Laureate but also a professor at Saint Louis University for five decades.  "The University's $82 million Edward A. Doisy Research Center is now the new home of Saint Louis University researchers working in five key areas of scientific discovery: cancer and molecular biology; liver disease; cardiovascular disease; neurosciences and aging; and vaccine development".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slu.edu/x30261.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective April 1, 2008, Philip O. Alderson, former chairman of the radiology department at [[Columbia University]], became the 12th dean of the Medical School.

The medical school continues to be a leader in research in many fields, especially in emerging diseases, neuroscience, organ transplantation, vaccine development, cardiac health, and afflictions of the liver. Currently, numerous cutting edge research projects are underway including those examining aging and brain disorders, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, biodefense, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and tuberculosis vaccines. Actually, the Saint Louis School of Medicine is one of only eight NIH-funded vaccine research institutions, and made significant contributions to the research and development of the H1N1 influenza vaccine. Furthermore, the Saint Louis University Liver Center is a national leader in the field of hepatology and is also considered one of the largest hepatitis C practices in the world.

==Rankings and admissions==
Admissions to Saint Louis University School of Medicine is highly selective. Matriculates had an average GPA of 3.84 and an average MCAT score of 33 ([[Medical School Admission Requirements]] 2014 edition).  Apart from these academic characteristics, the admissions committee recognizes a responsibility to consider applicants as individuals, particularly in the evaluation of the breadth of their educational experience, their personality traits, maturity level, and appropriate motivation and commitment to a career in medicine. For the most recent class to matriculate at Saint Louis University School of Medicine, 8,518 applicants competed for 181 seats. 

Saint Louis University School of Medicine is currently ranked 70th for research by the 2019 edition of ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' of the 149 fully accredited U.S. medical schools (by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education and the [[American Osteopathic Association]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/st.-louis-university-04057&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Saint Louis University School of Medicine was recently ranked 54 among the nation's 130 medical schools surveyed and the school's geriatrics program was ranked number 13 in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slu.edu/x12524.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Smoking in France'''  was first restricted on public transport by the 1976 Veil law.  Further restrictions were established in the 1991 [[Loi Evin|Évin law]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/texteconsolide/ADEAN.htm Law n°91-32 of 10 January 1991]&lt;/ref&gt; which contains a variety of measures against [[alcoholism]] and [[tobacco]] consumption. A much stronger [[smoking ban]] was introduced on 1 February 2007. Smoking in enclosed public places such as offices, [[Education in France|schools]], [[Political system of France|government]] buildings and restaurants is strictly prohibited. Law officials may enforce the laws with minimum fines set at €500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| title=  Smoking Ban? The French Light Up Again in Public
| publisher=  [[TIME (magazine)|TIME]]
| date= Dec 26, 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Veil law is named after [[Simone Veil]], the French activist health minister, who took an initiative to fight against tobacco smoking in France in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lauriehwang.weebly.com|title=Veil law - First Restrictions on Public Smoking in France|website=lauriehwang.weebly.com|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veil banned advertising for tobacco or tobacco products and required tobacco companies to print severe warnings on their cigarette packages, such as "''Abus Dangereux'' – [Overuse is Hazardous]." Another significant aspect of the Veil Law was to place limitations on smoking places ''affectés à un usage collectif'' (open to the public).

The Évin law is named after [[Claude Évin]], the minister who pushed for it. The law leaves certain important criteria on what is allowed or not with respect to smoking sections to executive-issued regulations, and it is those regulations that were altered in 2007.
 
A legal challenge against the new regulations was filed before the [[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]] in 2007, but was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurispd/index_ac_ld0713.shtml Ruling of 19 March 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427233059/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurispd/index_ac_ld0713.shtml |date=27 April 2007 }} of the Conseil d'État ([http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnDocument?base=JADE&amp;nod=JGXAX2007X03X000000300467 copy] on [[Légifrance]])&lt;/ref&gt; Under the initial implementation rules of the 1991 Évin law, restaurants, cafés etc. just had to provide smoking and non-smoking sections, which in practice were often not well separated. In larger establishments, smoking and non-smoking sections could be separate rooms, but often they were just areas within the same room.

==Current status==
Smoking and vaping are banned in all indoor public places (government buildings, offices, public transport, universities, museums, restaurants, cafés, nightclubs, etc.). Cafés and shops selling tobacco-related products are submitted to the same regulations. No exceptions exist for special smoking rooms fulfilling strict conditions.
Additionally, some outdoor public places also ban smoking and vaping (railway stations).

As of 2015, 32% of French adults declare themselves to be regular smokers.

In case of violation of tobacco laws, the smoker can face a fine up to €450 and the owner of the venue up to €750.

Plain packaging was introduced in 2017.

The island of '''Spinalonga''' ({{lang-el|Σπιναλόγκα}}), officially known as '''[[Kalydon (Elounda)|Kalydon]]''' (Καλυδών), is located in the Gulf of [[Elounda]] in north-eastern [[Crete]], in [[Lasithi]], next to the town of Plaka. The island is further assigned to the area of [[Kalydon (Elounda)|Kalydon]].
It is near the [[Spinalonga peninsula]] ("large Spinalonga") – which often causes confusion as the same name is used for both. The official Greek name of the island today is Kalydon.

Originally, Spinalonga was not an island – it was part of the island of Crete. During Venetian occupation the island was carved out of the coast for defence purposes and a fort was built there. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

During [[Ionian Islands under Venetian rule|Venetian rule]], salt was harvested from salt pans around the island.{{Citation needed|reason=There are also Venetian salt-pans near the causeway leading to Spinalonga Peninsula|date=November 2011}} The island has also been used as a [[leper colony]]. Spinalonga has appeared in novels, television series, and a short film.

== Origin of the name ==
[[File:Spinalonga-et-al-from-OSM-view-with-text-4.png|thumb|left|Map of Elounda, Spinalonga and surrounding areas.]]
According to Venetian documents, the name of the island originated in the Greek expression στην Ελούντα ''stin Elounda'' (meaning "to [[Elounda]]"). The Venetians could not understand the expression so they familiarized it using their own language, and called it ''spina'' "thorn" ''longa'' "long", an expression that was also maintained by the locals. The Venetians were inspired for this expression by the name of an island near Venice called by the same name and which is known today as the island of [[Giudecca]].{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==History==
The Venetian [[cartographer]] [[Vincenzo Coronelli]] reports that Spinalonga was not always an island, but was once linked with the adjacent [[Peninsula Spinalonga]]. He mentions that in 1526, the Venetians cut down a portion of the peninsula and thus created the island. Because of its position the island was fortified from its earliest years in order to protect the entranceway of the port of Ancient [[Olous]].

===Arab raids===
Olous, and accordingly the wider region, were depopulated at the middle of the 7th century because of the raids of the Arab pirates in the Mediterranean. Olous remained deserted until the mid-15th century when the Venetians began to construct salt-pans in the shallow and salty waters of the gulf. Subsequently, the region acquired commercial value and became inhabited. This, in combination with the emergent Turkish threat, particularly after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, and the continuous pirate raids, forced the Venetians to fortify the island.

===Venetian rule===
{{details|Venetian Crete}}
[[File:Spinalonga island.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A view of the Venetian fortifications]]
In 1578 the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] charged the engineer Genese Bressani to plan the island's fortifications. He created [[blockhouse]]s at the highest points of the northern and southern side of the island, as well as a fortification ring along the coast that closed out any hostile disembarkation. In 1579, the ''[[Provveditore generale di Candia]]'', Luca Michiel, put the foundation stone of the fortifications, built over the ruins of an [[acropolis]]. There are two inscriptions that cite this event, one on the transom of the main gate of the castle and the other on the base of the rampart at the north side of the castle. In 1584, the Venetians, realising that the coastal fortifications were easy to conquer by the enemies attacking from the nearby hills, decided to strengthen their defense by constructing new fortifications at the top of the hill. The Venetian fire would thus have bigger range, rendering Spinalonga an impregnable sea fortress, one of the most important in the Mediterranean basin.

Spinalonga, along with [[Gramvousa]] and [[Souda (island)|Souda]], remained in Venetian hands even after the rest of Crete fell to the Ottomans in the [[Cretan War (1645–1669)]] and until 1715, when they fell to the Ottomans during the [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–1718)|last Ottoman–Venetian War]].&lt;ref name="Maltezou159"&gt;Maltezou, ''Crete under Venetian rule'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; These three forts defended Venetian [[trade routes]] and were also useful bases in the event of a new Venetian-Turkish war for Crete.&lt;ref name="Detorakis343"&gt;Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christians found refuge in these fortresses to escape persecution from the Ottoman Turks.
[[File:Spinalonga.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Island of Spinalonga]]

===Ottoman rule===
{{Details|Ottoman Crete}}
In 1715, the Ottoman Turks captured Spinalonga taking over the last remaining Venetian fortress and removing the last trace of Venetian military presence from the island of Crete.&lt;ref name="Detorakis338"&gt;Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cretan revolt===
At the end of the Ottoman occupation the island, together with the fort at [[Ierapetra]], was the refuge of many Ottoman families that feared Christian reprisals.&lt;ref name="Detorakis385"&gt;Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Cretan Revolt (1866–1869)|revolution of 1866]] other Ottoman families came to the island from all the region of [[Mirampello|Mirabello]]. During the Cretan revolt of 1878, only Spinalonga and the fortress at Ierapetra were not taken by the Christian Cretan insurgents.&lt;ref name="Detorakis406"&gt;Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 406&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1881 the 1112 Ottomans formed their own community and later, in 1903, the last Turks left the island.

===20th century leper colony===
The island was subsequently used as a [[leper colony]] from 1903 to 1957. It is notable for being one of the last active leper colonies in Europe. The last inhabitant, a priest, left the island in 1962. This was to maintain the religious tradition of the [[Greek Orthodox]] church, in which a buried person has to be commemorated at following intervals of 40 days; 6 months; 1 year; 3 years; and 5 years, after their death. Other leper colonies that have survived Spinalonga include [[Tichileşti]] in Eastern [[Romania]], [[Fontilles]] in Spain and [[Talsi]] in Latvia. As of 2002, few [[lazaretto]]s remain in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=27 March 2005| url=http://www.abc.net.au/gnt/history/Transcripts/s1231982.htm| title=Peel Island| work=GNT History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two entrances to Spinalonga, one being the ''lepers' entrance'', a tunnel known as "[[Dante]]'s Gate". This was so named because the patients did not know what was going to happen to them once they arrived. However, once on the island they received food, water, medical attention and social security payments. Previously, such amenities had been unavailable to Crete's leprosy patients, as they mostly lived in the area's caves, away from civilization.

== Spinalonga today ==
Today, the uninhabited island is a popular tourist attraction in Crete. In addition to the abandoned leper colony and the fortress, Spinalonga is known for its small pebble beaches and shallow waters. The island can easily be accessed from Plaka, [[Elounda]] and [[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Agios Nikolaos]]. Tourist boats depart from all three towns on a daily basis (every 30 minutes from Elounda). There is no accommodation on Spinalonga, meaning all tours last only a few hours. Boat trips from [[Elounda]] take approximately 25 minutes while trips departing [[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Agios Nikolaos]] can take almost an hour. Round trip fare from Plaka is 8 Euro, from Elounda 10 Euro. Entrance to the island costs 8 Euro/adult.

==In popular culture==
[[File:20100820 Spinalonga island Crete Panorama.jpg|thumb|500px|West bank of Spinalonga]]

Spinalonga featured in the British television series ''[[Who Pays the Ferryman?]]'' and [[Werner Herzog]]'s experimental short film ''[[Last Words (film)|Last Words]]''. It is the (unnamed) setting of Ali Smith's short story ''[[The Touching of Wood]]'' (in ''[[Free Love and Other Stories]]'', 1995). It is also the setting for the 2005 novel ''[[The Island (2005 novel)|The Island]]'' by [[Victoria Hislop]], the story of a family's ties to the leper colony;  the book was adapted for television in the television series ''[[To Nisi]]'' by [[Mega Channel]] Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_civ_0_27/01/2010_114376 Mega takes on ‘The Island’]&lt;/ref&gt;

The short story "Spinalonga" by John Ware, about a tourist group that visits the island, was included in the 13th [[Pan Book of Horror]].&lt;ref name="DoG"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/comics/90459/the_pan_books_of_horror_stories.html|title=The Pan Books Of Horror Stories|date=24 July 2008|work=Den of Geek|publisher=Dennis Publishing|accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16945">'''Squamous cell carcinomas''' (SCCs),  also known as '''epidermoid carcinomas''', comprise a number of different types of [[cancer]] that result from [[squamous cells]].&lt;ref name=NCI2016Def/&gt; These cells form the surface of the [[skin]] and lining of hollow organs in the body and line the [[respiratory tract|respiratory]] and [[digestive tract]]s.&lt;ref name=NCI2016Def&gt;{{cite web|title=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=46595|website=National Cancer Institute|access-date=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common types include:
*[[Squamous cell skin cancer]]: A type of [[skin cancer]]
*[[Squamous-cell carcinoma of the lung]]: A type of [[lung cancer]]
*[[Squamous cell thyroid carcinoma]]: A type of [[thyroid cancer]]
*[[Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma]]: A type of [[esophageal cancer]]
*[[Squamous-cell carcinoma of the vagina]]: A type of [[vaginal cancer]]

Despite sharing the name "squamous cell carcinoma", the SCCs of different body sites can show differences in their presented [[symptom]]s, [[natural history of disease|natural history]], [[prognosis]], and response to [[cancer treatment|treatment]].

==Types==
[[Human papillomavirus infection]] has been associated with SCCs of the [[HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer|oropharynx]], lung,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu Y, Yang A, Hu S, Yan H | title = Correlation of HPV-16/18 infection of human papillomavirus with lung squamous cell carcinomas in Western China | journal = Oncology Reports | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 1627–32 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19424646 | doi = 10.3892/or_00000397 | url = http://www.spandidos-publications.com/or/21/6/1627 }}&lt;/ref&gt; fingers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma In Situ of the Finger| url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/458357|access-date=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anogenital region.

===Head and neck cancer===

===Thyroid===

{{Main|Squamous cell thyroid carcinoma}}

Primary squamous cell thyroid carcinoma shows an aggressive biological phenotype resulting in poor prognosis for patients.&lt;ref name="Syied"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Syed MI, Stewart M, Syed S, Dahill S, Adams C, McLellan DR, Clark LJ | title = Squamous cell carcinoma of the thyroid gland: primary or secondary disease? | journal = The Journal of Laryngology and Otology | volume = 125 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–9 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20950510 | doi = 10.1017/S0022215110002070 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esophagus===

[[Esophageal cancer]] may be due to either esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) or [[adenocarcinoma]] (EAC). SCCs tend to occur closer to the mouth, while adenocarcinomas occur closer to the stomach. [[Dysphagia]] (difficulty swallowing, solids worse than liquids) and [[odynophagia|painful swallowing]] are common initial symptoms. If the disease is localized, [[esophagectomy|surgical removal of the affected esophagus]] may offer the possibility of a cure. If the disease has spread, [[chemotherapy]] and radiotherapy are commonly used.

===Lung===

{{Main|Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung}}
[[File:Ca bronchus.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of a squamous cell carcinoma: Tumour is on the left, obstructing the bronchus (lung), beyond the tumour, the bronchus is inflamed and contains mucus.]]

When associated with the lung, it is typically a centrally located large-cell cancer (nonsmall-cell lung cancer). It often has a [[paraneoplastic syndrome]] causing ectopic production of [[parathyroid hormone-related protein]], resulting in [[hypercalcemia]], but paraneoplastic syndrome is more commonly associated with small-cell lung cancer. It is primarily due to smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Charlotte | last1 = Pooler | first2 = Ruth A | last2 = Hannon | first3 = Carol | last3 = Porth | first4 = Glenn | last4 = Matfin | name-list-format = vanc |title=Porth pathophysiology: concepts of altered health states |year=2010 |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-1-60547-781-7 |pages=660 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-MFXOEG0lcC&amp;pg=PA660 |edition=1st Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Penis===
Human papillomavirus (HPV), primarily HPV 16 and 18, are strongly implicated in the development of SCC of the penis.
Three carcinomas ''in situ'' are associated with SCCs of the penis:

# [[Bowen's disease]] presents as leukoplakia on the shaft.  Around a third of cases progress to SCC.
# [[Erythroplasia of Queyrat]], a variation of Bowen's disease, presents as erythroplakia on the glans.
# Bowenoid papulosis, which histologically resembles Bowen disease,  presents as reddish papules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Robbins |first1=Stanley |last2=Kumar |first2=Vinay |last3=Abbas |first3=Abul |last4=Fausto |first4=Nelson | name-list-format = vanc |title=Robbins Basic Pathology |date=2007 |publisher=Saunders/Elsevier |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-1-4160-2973-1 |pages=688 |edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostate===

When associated with the [[prostate]], squamous cell carcinoma is very aggressive in nature. It is difficult to detect as no increase in [[prostate specific antigen|prostate-specific antigen]] levels is seen, meaning that the cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage.

===Vagina and cervix===

[[Squamous-cell carcinoma of the vagina|Vaginal SCC]] spreads slowly and usually stays near the vagina, but may spread to the lungs and liver. This is the most common type of [[vaginal cancer]].

===Bladder===

Most bladder cancer is transitional cell, but bladder cancer associated with [[schistosomiasis]] is often SCC.

==Diagnosis==
===Classification===
Cancer can be considered a very large and exceptionally heterogeneous family of malignant diseases, with squamous cell carcinomas comprising one of the largest subsets.&lt;ref name='BermanTaxonomy'&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berman JJ | title = Tumor taxonomy for the developmental lineage classification of neoplasms | journal = BMC Cancer | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 88 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15571625 | pmc = 535937 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2407-4-88 | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/4/88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='BermanAristotle'&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berman JJ | title = Tumor classification: molecular analysis meets Aristotle | journal = BMC Cancer | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 10 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15113444 | pmc = 415552 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2407-4-10 | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/4/10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='who2004'&gt;{{cite book |title=Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart |editor1-last=Travis |editor1-first=William D |editor2-last=Brambilla |editor2-first=Elisabeth |editor3-last=Muller-Hermelink |editor3-first=H Konrad |editor4-last=Harris |editor4-first=Curtis C | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |year=2004 |series=World Health Organization Classification of Tumours |isbn=92-832-2418-3 |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/pat-gen/bb10/bb10-cover.pdf |access-date=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All SCC lesions are thought to begin via the repeated, uncontrolled division of cancer [[stem cells]] of epithelial lineage or characteristics.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} SCCs arise from [[squamous cell]]s, which are flat cells that line many areas of the body.  Accumulation of these cancer cells causes a microscopic focus of abnormal cells that are, at least initially, locally confined within the specific tissue in which the progenitor cell resided. This condition is called squamous cell [[carcinoma in situ|carcinoma ''in situ'']], and it is diagnosed when the tumor has not yet penetrated the [[basement membrane]] or other delimiting structure to invade adjacent tissues. Once the lesion has grown and progressed to the point where it has breached, penetrated, and infiltrated adjacent structures, it is referred to as "[[Invasive (medical)|invasive]]" squamous cell carcinoma. Once a carcinoma becomes invasive, it is able to spread to other organs and cause the formation of a [[metastasis]], or "secondary tumor".

====Tissue of origin====

The [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|International Classification of Diseases for Oncology]] (ICD-O) system lists a number of [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] subtypes and variants of [[malignant]] squamous cell [[neoplasm]]s, including:&lt;ref name='ICD-O-2'&gt;World Health Organization. ''International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Second Edition''. Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organization, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Papillary thyroid cancer|Papillary thyroid carcinoma]] (code 8050/3)
*Verrucous squamous cell carcinoma (code 8051/3)
*Papillary squamous cell carcinoma (code 8052/3)
*Squamous cell carcinoma (code 8070/3)
*Large-cell keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (code 8071/3)
*Large-cell nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (code 8072/3)
*Small-cell keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (code 8073/3)
*Spindle-cell squamous cell carcinoma(code 8074/3)
*Adenoid/pseudoglandular squamous cell carcinoma (code 8075/3)
*Intraepidermal squamous cell carcinoma (code 8081/3)
*Lymphoepithelial carcinoma (code 8082/3)

Other variants of SCCs are recognized under other systems, such as [[keratoacanthoma]].

====Morphology====
* [[Bowen's disease]] is a sunlight-induced skin disease, and is considered to be an early form of SCC.
* [[Erythroplasia of Queyrat]]
* [[Keratoacanthoma]] is a low-grade malignancy of the skin.  It originates in the [[sebaceous gland|pilosebaceous glands]], and is similar in clinical presentation and microscopic analysis to SCC, except that it contains a central [[keratin]] plug.  Statistically, it is less likely to become invasive than SCC.
* [[Marjolin's ulcer]] is a type of SCC that arises from a nonhealing [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]] or burn wound. More recent evidence, however, suggests that genetic differences exist between SCC and [[Marjolin's ulcer]], which were previously underappreciated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sinha S, Su S, Workentine M, Agabalyan N, Cheng M, Gabriel V, Biernaskie J | title = Transcriptional Analysis Reveals Evidence of Chronically Impeded ECM Turnover and Epithelium-to-Mesenchyme Transition in Scar Tissue Giving Rise to Marjolin's Ulcer | journal = Journal of Burn Care &amp; Research | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = e14-e22 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27679957 | doi = 10.1097/BCR.0000000000000432 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Microscopic appearance====
One method of classifying squamous cell carcinomas is by their [[histology|appearance under microscope]]. Subtypes may include:
* Adenoid squamous cell carcinoma (also known as pseudoglandular squamous cell carcinoma) is characterized by a tubular microscopic pattern and [[keratinocyte]] [[acantholysis]].&lt;ref name="Fitz2"&gt;{{cite book | editor-first1 = Thomas B | editor-last1 = Fitzpatrick | editor-first2 = Irwin M | editor-last2 = Freedberg | name-list-format = vanc |date=2003 |title=Fitzpatrick's dermatology in general medicine |edition=6th |location=New York, NY |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-138076-0 |page=743}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma is characterized by a predilection for the tongue base.&lt;ref name="Fitz2"/&gt;
* Clear-cell squamous cell carcinoma (also known as clear-cell carcinoma of the skin) is characterized by keratinocytes that appear clear as a result of [[hydropic swelling]].&lt;ref name="Fitz2"/&gt;
* Signet ring-cell squamous cell carcinoma (occasionally rendered as signet ring-cell squamous cell carcinoma) is a histological variant characterized by concentric rings composed of keratin and large [[vacuole]]s corresponding to markedly dilated [[endoplasmic reticulum]].&lt;ref name="Fitz2"/&gt; These vacuoles grow to such an extent that they radically displace the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] toward the cell membrane, giving the cell a distinctive superficial resemblance to a "signet ring" when viewed under a [[microscope]].
* Spindle-cell squamous cell carcinoma (also known as spindle-cell carcinoma&lt;ref name="Bolognia"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rapini | first1 = Ronald P. | last2 = Bolognia | first2 = Jean L. | last3 = Jorizzo | first3 = Joseph L. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a subtype characterized by spindle-shaped atypical cells.&lt;ref name="Fitz2"/&gt;

SCC is a histologically distinct form of cancer. It arises from the uncontrolled multiplication of cells of epithelium, or cells showing particular cytological or tissue architectural characteristics of squamous cell differentiation, such as the presence of keratin, [[tonofilament]] bundles, or [[desmosome]]s, structures involved in cell-to-cell adhesion.

Studies have found evidences for an association between diet and skin cancers, including SCC. The consumption of high-fat dairy foods increases SCC tumor risk in people with previous skin cancer. Green leafy vegetables may help prevent development of subsequent SCC and multiple studies found that raw vegetables, citrus fruits and noncitrus fruits are significantly protective against SSC risk.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = De Stefani E, Deneo-Pellegrini H, Ronco AL, Boffetta P, Brennan P, Muñoz N, Castellsagué X, Correa P, Mendilaharsu M | title = Food groups and risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus: a case-control study in Uruguay | journal = British Journal of Cancer | volume = 89 | issue = 7 | pages = 1209–14 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14520448 | pmc = 2394307 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjc.6601239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen YK, Lee CH, Wu IC, Liu JS, Wu DC, Lee JM, Goan YG, Chou SH, Huang CT, Lee CY, Hung HC, Yang JF, Wu MT | title = Food intake and the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in different sections of the esophagus in Taiwanese men | journal = Nutrition | volume = 25 | issue = 7-8 | pages = 753–61 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19394796 | doi = 10.1016/j.nut.2009.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, consumption of whole milk, yogurt, and cheese may increase SCC risk in susceptible people. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hughes MC, van der Pols JC, Marks GC, Green AC | title = Food intake and risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in a community: the Nambour skin cancer cohort study | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 119 | issue = 8 | pages = 1953–60 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16721782 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.22061 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, meat and fat dietary pattern can increase the risk of SCC in people without a history of SCC, but the association is again more prominent in people with a history of skin cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ibiebele TI, van der Pols JC, Hughes MC, Marks GC, Williams GM, Green AC | title = Dietary pattern in association with squamous cell carcinoma of the skin: a prospective study | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 85 | issue = 5 | pages = 1401–8 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17490979 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/85.5.1401 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco smoking and a dietary pattern characterized by high beer and liquor intake also increase the risk of SCC significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bahmanyar S, Ye W | title = Dietary patterns and risk of squamous-cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia: a population-based case-control study in Sweden | journal = Nutrition and Cancer | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 171–8 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16898861 | doi = 10.1207/s15327914nc5402_3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''St John Ambulance Australia (also known as St John )''' ('''SJAA''') is a self-funding [[charitable organisation]] dedicated to helping people in sickness, distress, suffering or danger. It is part of an international organisation that consists of eight Priories that form the [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Order of St John]]. The organisation is sometimes incorrectly referred to as "St John's Ambulance" instead of "St John Ambulance".

St John First Aid training centres were established in [[Australia]] in the late 19th century. On 13 June 1883 a public meeting was held in the [[Melbourne Town Hall]] to form a local branch of the association. By the end of June 1883, a centre had been established under the leadership of [[Edward Neild]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stjohn.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=19 |title= History |publisher=St John Ambulance Australia |accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first division of the St John Ambulance Brigade (now known as St John Ambulance Event Health Services) was established in [[Glebe, New South Wales]] in 1903. A division of this organisation is still in operation today and is known as St John Ambulance [http://sjaglebe.com/featured/a-step-back-in-time/ Glebe Division]. After this initial division was established other states followed suit, with divisions being set up in other states soon after. In 1987, the organisation adopted a single public title, "St John Ambulance Australia". The cadet movement was established in Australia in 1925 with a division in Glebe, NSW. The first Grand Prior's Badge issued outside the UK went to a cadet from Marrickville Cadet Division in 1933 named Marion Higgins.

== Structure of St John ==
[[File:St John Ambulance in Australia.jpg|thumb|St John First Aid Services Ambulance]]
The organisation is divided into the states/territories who have their own boards and oversee the day-to-day running of St John. Some states are also divided into regions, who oversee all branches and report to the state boards. St John Ambulance Australia has three main branches, with each one having its own specific area of operation.

=== Event Health Services ===
St John provides volunteer event health &amp; first aid services at events and emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stjohn.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=41 |title= First Aid Services |publisher=St John Ambulance Australia |accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; First Aid Services is divided into states, regions and divisions.

Events covered by St. John Australia include sports, such as the [[2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games]], where a team of 500 members treated over 3000 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dutch|first=Martin J|author2=Senini, Lisa M |author3=Taylor, Deborah J |title=Mass gathering medicine: The Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games experience|journal=Emergency Medicine Australasia|date=31 May 2008|volume=20|issue=3|pages=228–233|doi=10.1111/j.1742-6723.2008.01085.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other events covered include sporting events, such as the [[Australian Open (tennis)|Australian Open]], music concerts and community fetes.

St John EHS volunteers support state emergency management and disaster plans in some states, in conjunction with other organisations like the [[State Emergency Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stjohnvic.com.au/com-extraordinary-people-wanted.asp |title= Extraordinary People Wanted |publisher=St John Ambulance Australia (Victoria) |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commercial First Aid Training===
St John is the largest first aid training organisation in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stjohnvic.com.au/you-aid-courses.asp |title= First Aid Courses |publisher=St John Ambulance Australia (Victoria) |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from its flagship Provide First aid (a workplace first aid course), St John also offer instruction in topics such as Advanced Resuscitation, Advanced First Aid, AED (Automated External Defibrillation) and analgesic administration, remote first aid and occupational first aid.

=== Ophthalmic branch ===

== Youth and cadet movements ==
{{Further|St John Ambulance Australia Cadets}}
St John runs Cadet Divisions for children aged 8–17, this includes Juniors (8-11) and Cadets (11-17). These can be found in most towns or suburbs of major cities in Australia. Examples are Glebe Division and Bathurst Division in [[New South Wales]], [[Greater Dandenong]] Division in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and Playford Cadet Division in South Australia.

The youth program in Australia, focuses on developing young people in a variety of aspects. Young members are taught first aid and participate in youth development and social activities. For cadets, it is also possible to study for various 'badges'. Some of the topics available include counter-disaster, animal care and cookery.

Across most divisions, youth and cadet divisions meet once a week, in a designated place, to conduct a training night. There is a designated training program for youth and cadet divisions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjaa.com.au/volunteers|title= Volunteers|accessdate =28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth members within Event and Emergency First Aid Service programs attend public duties to provide first aid at various events to members of the public. These duties include things such as: Big Day Out, [[Sydney Royal Easter Show|Royal Easter Show]] (NSW), [[National Folk Festival (Australia)|National Folk Festival]] (ACT), [[Australian Football League|AFL]] Games (All AFL states), NRL, Super 12, and [[Rugby Union]] games, amongst other popular events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ambulance.net.au/content.asp?id=145 |title= St John Ambulance Western Australia |publisher=St John Ambulance Australia |accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many more lower profile events, like local fetes and markets. At these duties, St John members use treatment tools such as oxygen therapy equipment, defibrillators and analgesic gases on top of the standard first aid equipment.

In most states, new youth members (minimum age 14) will be put through a Senior First Aid Course (SFA) free of charge.

St John youth also provides leadership opportunities for people of all ages. The program possesses a leadership program and a ranking system similar to the military.

First aid competitions are also held each year. In these competitions, cadets (in teams of up to 3, or on their own) are tested on their first aid skill, practical thinking and problem solving ability, and scene management skills. A national competition is held every year, at the National Cadet Camp.

== Youth Councils ==

Each State and Territory is encouraged to facilitate provision of a Youth Council, the National Office also facilitates the Australian Youth Council. Broadly, Youth Councils provide guidance to St John on issues affecting the organisation and its future development, particularly concerning the opinion and interests of young people.

In 2006, the Australian Youth Council (AYC) restructured to be made up of 16 State/Territory representatives (nominated by their State/Territory, including the State/Territory Chairperson and another representative) and 5 National portfolio holders, including a Communications Coordinator, Training and Leadership Coordinator, Research Development Coordinator, Policy Coordinator and Australian Chair. The AYC Chair also sits as a full member of the National Board of Directors for St John Ambulance Australia. The aims of the Australian Youth Council include:

# To work across St John to make it the volunteering organisation of choice for young people in Australia.
# To provide opportunity for young people to actively participate in the governance of St John.
# To provide guidance to St John that will contribute to the further development and improvement of the organisation.
# To develop young leaders in St John.
# To be relevant to young people.

The AYC usually meets in person once or twice a year, usually including the National Conference or Priory in June, and another meeting (Youth Stakeholders Weekend) later in the year, as well as teleconferences during the year which may include either the entire Council or the National Team.

Youth councils consist of young people in the organisation who are aged 12 to 25 years.

[[File:Susana-logo.png|thumb|Logo of the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]]

The '''Sustainable Sanitation Alliance''' ('''SuSanA''') is a loose network of organizations who are "working along the same lines towards achieving [[sustainable sanitation]]".&lt;ref name="website 1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/about/vision-mission|title=Vision|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began its work in 2007, one year before the United Nation's [[International Year of Sanitation]] in 2008. The intention of creating SuSanA was to have a joint label for the planned activities for 2008 and to align the various organizations for further initiatives.

SuSanA has over 340 partner organizations and over 10,000 individual members (as of November 2018).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/partner|title=Partners|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.susana.org/forum/statistics|title=Discussion forum statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=Discussion Forum|publisher=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; SuSanA's vision document contains a definition of sustainable sanitation which was developed by SuSanA partners in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;SuSanA (2008). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/267 Towards more sustainable sanitation solutions - SuSanA Vision Document]. Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA)&lt;/ref&gt;

SuSanA is not an [[NGO]] ([[non-governmental organization]]). It has no legal structure and takes no membership fees. It encourages other organizations to join the network and to become active members in the thematic working groups.

The SuSanA secretariat is funded by the [[Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development|German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development]] which has commissioned the [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit]] (GIZ) for this task. Other SuSanA partners make contributions for example by paid time of their staff members.

SuSanA is dedicated to achieving the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], and in particular SDG6 (Goal Number 6) which is "water and sanitation for all".&lt;ref name="website 1" /&gt; This is done by promoting [[sustainable sanitation]] systems. These systems should be "economically viable, socially acceptable, technically and institutionally appropriate, and protect health, the environment and natural resources".&lt;ref name="website 2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/about/vision-mission|title=Sustainable sanitation|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SuSanA is one of several knowledge management platform in the [[WASH]] sector such as the [[LinkedIn]] Discussion Group "Community of Practice on Sanitation and Hygiene in Developing Countries" by [[Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council|WSSCC]], Blue Planet, [[International Water Association]] (IWA), Akvopedia and others.&lt;ref&gt;Cranston, P. (2014). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2023 Knowledge Management and Building Demand for Sanitation].

===Activities===
Since 2007, SuSanA has held 23 meetings in different locations around the world. Each year one meeting takes place before or after the [[World Water Week in Stockholm]], and a further meeting usually takes place in the [[Global South]], connected to another WASH event. SuSanA also organises side events, seminars and working group meetings in conjunction with other major [[WASH]] conferences.

SuSanA members are contributing to [[Wikipedia]] articles on WASH-related topics.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sei-international.org/press/press-releases/3771|title=Join the SuSanA Sanitation Wikipedia project|last=|first=|date=10 October 2017|website=Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are particularly active just before two [[List of international observances|international observance days]]: [[World Water Day]] on 22 March and [[World Toilet Day]] on 19 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sei-international.org/-news-archive/3642|title=SuSanA seeks volunteers to upgrade Wikipedia sanitation pages|last=|first=|date=9 March 2017|website=Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They have also set up a list of "[[List of abbreviations used in sanitation]]".&lt;ref name="website 3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/shared-learning/glossary|title=Glossary and Wikipedia|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On their Twitter account they promote these activities by using the hashtag: #edit4toilets.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/Sanitation_Wikipedia/2|title=Wikipedia:Meetup/Sanitation Wikipedia/2|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikipedia Project Page|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}}

=== Funding sources ===

SuSanA has no legal structure, budget nor income. Partners contribute time and resources from their own budgets. The SuSanA secretariat is funded by the [[Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development|German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (BMZ) who has commissioned the [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit]] (GIZ) GmbH. Between 2012 and 2018, co-funding for the online Discussion Forum and other improvements to the SuSanA platform was provided by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth von Muench, Dorothee Spuhler, Trevor Surridge, Nelson Ekane, Kim Andersson, Emine Goekce Fidan, Arno Rosemarin (2013) [http://www.susana.org/_resources/documents/default/2-2042-ssp-17okt20134-10-about-the-gates-sanitation-grants-on-forum.pdf Sustainable Sanitation Alliance members take a closer look at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation’s sanitation grants], Sustainable Sanitation Practice Journal, Issue 17, p. 4-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sanitationupdates.wordpress.com/2016/11/04/sustainable-sanitation-alliance-grant-of-2-7-million-to-supercharge-sustainable-sanitation-knowledge-platform/|title=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance: Grant of $2.7 million to supercharge sustainable sanitation knowledge platform|last=|first=|date=4 November 2016|website=|publisher=Sanitation Updates|access-date=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several active core group partners, for example [[Stockholm Environment Institute|SEI]], seecon, [[Bremen Overseas Research and Development Association|BORDA]], [[Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology]], [[International Water Association|IWA]], [[WASTE]] have also funded various travel costs of SuSanA members, seminars, the printing of SuSanA publications and so forth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Impacts ===
The activities of the SuSanA network have contributed to increasing awareness about [[sustainability]] in the sanitation sector. SuSanA members were active in the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]] and helped to shape the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] where Goal Number 6 now includes a goal of universal use of sustainable sanitation services that protect [[public health]] and dignity.

Other actors have picked up on the theme of innovative sanitation (often with [[reuse of excreta]] in some form), most notably the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Sustainable sanitation has become a topic in the nexus (water, energy, food) dialogue as well as in the WASH and nutrition theme.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Structure==
=== Thematic working groups ===
SuSanA has 13 thematic working groups covering areas of [[sustainable sanitation]] where conceptual and knowledge management work is required:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.susana.org/en/working-groups/overview|title = Overview of the working groups|date = |accessdate = 3 March 2015|website = |publisher = Sustainable Sanitation Alliance|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Capacity building|Capacity development]]
# Market development
# Renewable energies and [[climate change]]
# Sanitation systems, technology options, [[hygiene]] and health - includes [[hand washing]]
# [[Food security]] and productive sanitation systems ([[reuse of excreta]])
# Cities and planning
# Community, rural and schools (with gender and social aspects) - includes [[community-led total sanitation]]
# Emergency and reconstruction situations ([[emergency sanitation]])
# Public Awareness, [[advocacy]] and civil society engagement
# Operation and maintenance
# Groundwater protection - includes [[groundwater pollution]] issues
# [[WASH]] and nutrition - includes issues on [[malnutrition]]
# [[Behavior change (public health)|Behavior change]]

=== Partner organizations ===
SuSanA has over 340 partner organizations (as of November 2018).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The partners are of the following types: Local NGO, International NGO, private sector, research and education, governmental / state-owned organization, multi-lateral organizations, associations and networks and others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;SuSanA (2014). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1302 A standard set of Powerpoint slides to explain SuSanA]. SuSanA Secretariat, located at GIZ, Eschborn, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; All prospective new SuSanA partner organizations have to agree to the vision document when they join.

A [[social network analysis|network analysis]] study conducted in 2014 assessed the SuSanA network by examining the communication channels used and the quality of relationships among partners.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Saffer|first1 = Adam|title = Sustainable Relationships within the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance: SuSanA Network Analysis Report|url = https://www.academia.edu/12048446/Sustainable_Relationships_within_the_Sustainable_Sanitation_Alliance_SuSanA_Network_Analysis_Report|publisher = University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, USA|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It found that "SuSanA partners have strong levels of trust, cooperation and information exchange with one another". However, partners seem to have low diversity of relationships with partners in different economic zones, such as [[developing countries]] versus developed countries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Many of the partners use their membership primarily to receive information from the discussion forum.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Individual members ===
Individuals can join as members. There are nearly 9000 members (as of November 2017).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Challenges and difficulties ==
SuSanA has been criticized by some in the [[WASH]] (Water, Sanitation, Hygiene) sector for a perceived dominance of the [[ecosan]] theme in SuSanA. This is due to the strong focus of two of its founding organizations on ecosan: [[Stockholm Environment Institute]] and [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH]]. Others have criticised SuSanA for being too focussed on technologies and sanitation systems (rather than on non-technical issues); that it is too dominated by people from the Global North; too dominated by GIZ who leads the secretariat; and too theoretical and far removed from the realities on the ground.

SuSanA has no regional nodes, offices or secretariats. It also has limited impact so far in the non-English speaking parts of the world, notably Latin America, Russia or Central Asia.

The SuSanA core group has reacted to these criticisms by defining a mission statement in 2014, a roadmap for 2013 onwards and by hosting an open discussion forum where such issues can be discussed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recommendations made in 2014 to the SuSanA network for its future development and to further develop relationships among partners include: Continue to hold meetings in different locations around the world, establish regional nodes, re-activate the working groups, and create more active members through engagement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== History ==
SuSanA started in January 2007 with a first meeting in Eschborn, Germany at [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH]], an international enterprise owned by the [[German Federal Government]]. GIZ agreed to host SuSanA's secretariat and has been doing so since 2007. The reason why SuSanA was started in 2007 was to prepare for the [[International Year of Sanitation]] in 2008, and to align the organizations active in sustainable sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVfU3df4mOA|title=SuSanA's milestones and impacts during 2007 - 2017 (by SuSanA members and Thilo Panzerbieter)|last=|first=|date=|website=Video of a presentation at the 10th SuSanA anniversary in Eschborn, Germany on 17 January 2017 (youtube video)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''T-3000''' is a fictional cyborg assassin, serving as the primary antagonist in ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'', the fifth installment in the [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'' series]], portrayed by [[Jason Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movieweb.com/terminator-genisys-posters-characters-t-3000/|title=‘Terminator Genisys’ Character Posters Introduce the T-3000 -- Jason Clarke's John Connor is not who he seems in a set of 5 ‘Terminator Genisys’ posters that show off each generation of cyborg.|publisher=[[movieweb.com]]|accessdate=2015-07-07|date=May 9, 2015|first=ALAN|last=ORANGE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/terminator-genisys-posters-present-t3000/|title=Terminator Genisys Posters Present The T-3000|publisher=wegotthiscovered.com|accessdate=2015-07-07|date=  |first=Isaac|last=Feldber}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/What-Exactly-John-Connor-Terminator-Genisys-70857.html|title=What Exactly Is John Connor In Terminator: Genisys?|publisher=cinemablend.com|accessdate=2015-07-07|date=  |first=Gregory|last=Wakeman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/2015/02/03/terminator-5-genisys-storyline-revealed-2653687?lt_source=external,manual|title=Terminator 5: Genisys Storyline Revealed!|publisher=[[moviepilot.com]]|accessdate=2015-07-07|date=February 3, 2015|first=Jim|last=Galizia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710084804/http://moviepilot.com/posts/2015/02/03/terminator-5-genisys-storyline-revealed-2653687?lt_source=external,manual|archivedate=July 10, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the film, the T-3000 is an alternate timeline counterpart of [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]]'s (portrayed by [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) nemesis [[John Connor]] (also portrayed by Clarke), created after Skynet infects a variant of Connor with [[nanotechnology]] and fractures the timeline. T-3000 also serves as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] personality to "Guardian" (a reprogrammed [[Terminator (character)|T-800]] portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]), a protagonist who is somewhat similar to T-3000 but also opposite in many ways, of their relationship dynamics with [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] (portrayed by [[Emilia Clarke]]) and [[Kyle Reese]] (portrayed by [[Jai Courtney]]).

The T-3000's sole mission is to protect and ensure the ultimate survival of Skynet, which seeks to eliminate the human race with its global machine network. The T-3000 describes itself as neither machine nor human; rather, it is a hybrid nanotechnological [[cyborg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/04/13/im-not-machine-im-not-man-im-more-new-trailer-for-terminator-genisys/|publisher=bleedingcool.com|title="I'm Not Machine, I'm Not Man... I'm More." - New Trailer For Terminator Genisys|accessdate=2015-07-08|date=April 13, 2015|first=Dan |last=Wickline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[David Ellison]] explains that the title ''Terminator Genisys'' "[is] in reference to genesis, which is in reference to the [[technological singularity|singularity]] and the [[posthuman|man-machine hybrid]] that John Connor ends up being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-terminator-genisys-20150702-story.html|publisher=[[latimes.com]]|title=Why was 'Terminator Genisys' spelled with a 'Y'?|accessdate=2015-07-08|date=July 3, 2015|first=Meredith|last=Woerner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|John Connor}}
In a desperate effort to ensure its survival, the rogue [[artificial intelligence]] Skynet creates an avatar for itself in the form of a T-5000 ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/rumor-matt-smiths-terminator-genisys-role-revealed-844|publisher=[[joblo.com]]|title=-Matt Smith's Terminator - Genisys Role Revealed|accessdate=2015-07-08|first=Jesse |last=Giroux}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Terminator (character concept)|Terminator]] travels through many timelines searching for a way to defeat the Human Resistance and ultimately infiltrates it under the guise of a fighter named Alex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/456251-matt-smiths-terminator-genisys-character-explained|publisher=comingsoon.com|title=Matt Smith’s Terminator Genisys Character Explained|accessdate=2015-07-08|first=SILAS |last=LESNICK |date=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Alex" is present as a soldier when [[John Connor]] and [[Kyle Reese]] ([[Jai Courtney]]) discover Skynet's [[time machine]] at the end of the war with the machines. As Kyle is being sent back in time to protect John's mother [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] ([[Emilia Clarke]]) from the T-800 Terminator sent to kill her in 1984, "Alex" carries out his attack. He kills all of the other soldiers nearby and infects John Connor with [[Nanorobotics|nanomachines]], transforming him into a new hybrid Terminator designated as the T-3000. John Connor's conversion into a Terminator as Kyle travels back in time turns out to be such a major event that it leads to a fracturing of the timeline, completely rewriting the past and the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/06/film-review-terminator-genisys/|publisher=[[consequenceofsound.net]]|title=Film Review: Terminator Genisys|accessdate=2015-07-08|first=MICHAEL |last=ROFFMANON |date=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/terminator-genisys-sequels-jai-courtney/|title=Jai Courtney Calls TERMINATOR GENISYS a "Reset" for the Franchise; Says You Don’t Have to Have Seen the Previous Films to Understand It|publisher=Collider|date=2014-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The T-3000 is sent back in time to 2014, and given the mission to assist Cyberdyne Systems as the company's architect in developing a new [[operating system]] named ''Genisys'', in addition to revolutionary robotic and time traveling technology, which is in reality Skynet and the recreation of its machines. When Sarah and Kyle arrive in 2017, he meets them at a hospital and convinces them that he really is John Connor, but his disguise is exposed by the [[Terminator (character)|Guardian]] (a reprogrammed T-800 portrayed by Schwarzenegger). The T-3000 engages the trio in multiple destructive battles before finally being destroyed by the Guardian by having his body disintegrated by a prototype time machine's [[magnetic field]]. Before his demise, the T-3000 furiously throws what remains of the Guardian's endoskeleton into a vat of [[mimetic]] polyalloy, inadvertently converting the Guardian into a nano-android with abilities similar to those of the [[T-1000]], and saving the Guardian's life.

The Guardian explains during the film that before the final battle between Skynet and the Resistance, the former attempted to create a number of T-3000s, but the human subjects went insane and died; John Connor was the only known subject to survive the transformation reasonably mentally intact, albeit now loyal to Skynet as opposed to his previous loyalty to humanity.

==Design==
The on-screen representation of the T-3000 was made by British effects company [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]]. Footage would combine Jason Clarke filmed on set, [[key frame|keyframed]] animation, and [[motion capture]]. Supervisor Peter Bebb said that the company tried to design the T-3000 like a computer would do it, focusing on design and battle efficiency, "form follows function". Given it is a Terminator built out of a human, the result is "a pure robot that sits under flesh structure", still retaining an overall human shape. The mechanical cells tried to resemble the material on [[stealth aircraft]], with a result described as "more [[Gloss and matte paint|matte]] than metal", resembling a slightly [[Iridescence|iridescent]] [[ceramic matrix composite|ceramic carbon]].&lt;ref name=fxguide&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/terminator-new-makes-new-models-new-vfx/|title=Terminator: New makes. New models. New VFX.|publisher=FX Guide|first=Ian|last=Failes|date=July 5, 2015|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postmagazine.com/Publications/Post-Magazine/2015/July-1-2015/Summer-Movies-Terminator-Genisys.aspx|title=Summer Movies: 'Terminator Genisys'|work=Post Magazine|first=Marc|last=Loftus|date=July 1, 2015|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abilities==
The Guardian identifies the T-3000 with John's form and memories as being made of ''machine-phase matter'' (essentially, [[programmable matter]]) held together by a [[magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/terminator-genisys-review-arnold-schwarzenegger-emilia-clarke-jason-clarke-jai-courtney/|publisher=[[thewrap.com]]|title=‘Terminator Genisys’ Review: Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Swagger Can’t Save This Redundant Tentpole|accessdate=2015-07-08|date=June 24, 2015|first=James |last=Rocchi }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=T-3000|url=http://www.terminatorgenisysmovie.co.uk/insidelook/?model=t3000&amp;content=shoulder|website=Terminator Genisys|publisher=Skydance Pictures|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119122228/http://www.terminatorgenisysmovie.co.uk/insidelook/?model=t3000&amp;content=shoulder|archivedate=2015-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the T-3000's abilities far exceed those of the T-1000 and other Terminator models. It is capable of [[shapeshifting]] at much more rapid speed than the [[liquid metal|mimetic polyalloy]] Terminators, though it is still limited by complexity or mass; its transformation abilities are such that it can dissolve into its most basic form while falling head-first through the air, reorient itself to land on its feet and be fully transformed back to normal by the time it stands up. Likewise, it is capable of regenerating from almost any injury in mere moments. Unlike previous Terminators, the T-3000 transforms and regenerates in layers, beginning with its bone structure, then muscle tissue, skin and clothing. These layers can be adjusted independently of each other, as shown when John Connor adds and removes his facial scar at will in the film. These aspects, combined with the access the cyborg has to its original human host's memories in addition retaining his or her personality, behavioral traits, and some levels of emotions, the T-3000 can easily convince even those well-versed in tactics used by Terminators that it is actually a human, essentially a machine that thinks like them (see [[Turing test]]). This makes it more effective than other Terminators at infiltration. It appears to retain the ability to infect others and create more T-3000s, as it offers this to Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese in ''Terminator Genisys''. The transformation, which is described as replacing its victim's body on the cellular level, cannot be reversed.

Though a formidable enemy, the T-3000 is not invulnerable. Because its abilities are primarily tied to its magnetic field, it is susceptible to magnetic attacks that disrupt said field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweirdrobot.com/2015/07/03/review-terminator-genisys/|publisher=theweirdrobot.com|title= Terminator Genisys|accessdate=2015-07-08|date=July 3, 2015|first=|last=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Weaker magnetism is capable of disrupting or disabling the T-3000's shapeshifting and regeneration abilities, due to affecting its ability to manipulate its particles. A sufficiently strong magnetic field can pull the T-3000 apart briefly to restrain it, and, if its body is exposed to a powerful magnetic field for a sustained amount of time, the cyborg can be torn apart and terminated. The machine-phase matter is also vulnerable to the laser used in shaping mimetic polyalloy for use in the construction of T-1000s. If struck by this laser, the T-3000 can suffer enough external damage to render its outermost layer irreparably compromised, forcing it to discard its human appearance and use its true machine form. The T-3000 is still susceptible to some degrees of physical injuries and pains, and its agonies can escalate when it is under a magnetic attack. It is also shown to experience pain and have its movements impaired when trapped in an electrical current. However, these effects are only temporary due to its regeneration capabilities, which heal it once it manages to escape the current.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1903">'''Teaching grandmother to suck eggs''' is an [[English language]] saying meaning that a person is giving advice to someone else about a subject of which they are already familiar (and probably more so than the first person).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/teach+grandmother+to+suck+eggs|title=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=2009-05-07}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the phrase==
The origins of the phrase are not clear.  The [[OED]] and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-tea1.htm|title=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that it comes from a translation in 1707, by J. Stevens, of [[Francisco de Quevedo]] (Spanish author):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"You would have me teach my Grandame to suck Eggs"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Notable early uses==
* ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling]]'', [[Henry Fielding]] (1749):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fielding.thefreelibrary.com/The-History-of-Tom-Jones-a-Foundling/12-13|title=The History of Tom Jones a Foundling, Chapter 12|author=Henry Fielding|accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“I remember my old schoolmaster, who was a prodigious great scholar, used often to say, Polly Matete cry Town is my daskalon. The English of which, he told us, was, That a child may sometimes teach his grandmother to suck eggs”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Letter from [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] to [[Leigh Hunt]], 15 August 1819:&lt;blockquote&gt;“But what am I about?  If my grandmother sucks eggs, was it I who taught her?”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Related phrase==
The use of the phrase "Suck-egg" for "a silly person" dates back to 1609, in the OED.&lt;ref name="aue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Alt/alt.usage.english/2006-04/msg00681.html|title=alt.usage.english|accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other problems include video game-provoked [[seizures]] in patients with [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name= pmid17211654&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shoja MM, Tubbs RS, Malekian A, Jafari Rouhi AH, Barzgar M, Oakes WJ |title=Video game epilepsy in the twentieth century: a review |journal=Childs Nerv Syst |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=265–7 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17211654 |doi=10.1007/s00381-006-0285-2 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rare and extreme cases, deaths have resulted from excessive video game playing (see [[Video game addiction#Deaths|Deaths due to video game addiction]]).

==General findings==
Studies look at students with powerful behavior records in the past and who finished a measure of characteristic aggressive. They found that students, who reported playing more violent games in their middle and high school time, occupied  with more forceful behavior, Moreover, the time spent playing violent games in the past related to lower grades in school, which is a cause of dissatisfaction for some students. 

There may or may not be an accompanying [[video game addiction]]. Video games are also been linked in some studies to [[aggressive behaviour]] and violence or fearful behaviour by its players in the short term although other studies have not supported this link.&lt;ref name= pmid16533123&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huesmann LR, Taylor LD |title= The role of media violence in violent behavior |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=27 |issue= |pages=393–415 |year=2006 |pmid=16533123 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.26.021304.144640 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= pmid19230901&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ferguson CJ, Kilburn J |title=The public health risks of media violence: a meta-analytic review |journal=J.

Studies have mainly reported health problems in children, mainly boys. Several specific names have been given to video-game related health problems, for example [[PlayStation thumb]], [[Nintendinitis]] and [[acute (medicine)|acute]] [[Wiiitis]]; however, the literature does not seem to support these as truly separate disease entities.&lt;ref name= pmid12441565&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gillespie RM |title=The physical impact of computers and electronic game use on children and adolescents, a review of current literature |journal=Work |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=249–59 |year=2002 |pmid=12441565 |doi= |url=http://iospress.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;issn=1051-9815&amp;volume=18&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Video game console]]s linked to medical problems include the [[PlayStation]] and the [[Nintendo]] [[Wii]], although it is unknown whether certain types are more connected to these problems than others.&lt;ref name="pmid17554133"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bonis J |title=Acute Wiiitis |journal=N.

[[Physical sign]]s linked to excessive video game playing include black rings in the skin under the eyes and [[Delayed onset muscle soreness|muscular stiffness]] in the shoulders, possibly caused by a tense posture or [[sleep deprivation]].&lt;ref name= pmid11737743&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tazawa Y, Okada K |title=Physical signs associated with excessive television-game playing and sleep deprivation |journal=Pediatr Int |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=647–50 |date=December 2001 |pmid=11737743 |doi= 10.1046/j.1442-200X.2001.01466.x| url= http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=1328-8067&amp;date=2001&amp;volume=43&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing literature on gaming is inconsistent, and studies occasionally produce contradictory results. Some studies show strong correlations between gaming and psychological issues like increased aggression in males and increased depression in females.&lt;ref name= pmid19765501&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=((Weaver JB III)), Mays D, Sargent Weaver S, Kannenberg W, Hopkins GL, Eroğlu D, Bernhardt JM |title=Health-risk correlates of video-game playing among adults. |journal= Am J Prev Med  |volume=37 |issue=4|pages=299–305 |date=October 2009|pmid=19765501 |doi= 10.1016/j.amepre.2009.06.014 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study claims that girls who gamed were less likely to experience depression but were more likely to get into fights.&lt;ref name= pmid21078729&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Desai RA, Krishnan-Sarin S, Cavallo D, Potenza MN |title=Video-gaming among high school students: health correlates, gender differences, and problematic gaming |journal=Pediatrics |volume=126 |issue=6 |pages=1414–24 |date=December 2010 |pmid=21078729 |doi=10.1542/peds.2009-2706|pmc=3678538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, during a speech to the [[American Medical Association]], US President [[Barack Obama]] identified video games as a health concern, stating that they are a key factor in unhealthy sedentary lifestyles.&lt;ref name= gamepolitics20090614obama&gt;{{cite news | website= GamePolitics.com |title=Obama Names Video Games as Health Concern in Speech to A.M.A.| url= http://www.gamepolitics.com/2009/06/15/obama-names-video-games-health-concern-speech-ama| date = 15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musculoskeletal issues ==
When questioned, children often admit to having physical complaints during video game playing, for example pain in the hands and wrists, back and neck.&lt;ref name="pmid12477916"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burke A, Peper E |title= Cumulative trauma disorder risk for children using computer products: results of a pilot investigation with a student convenience sample |journal=Public Health Rep |volume=117 |issue=4 |pages=350–7 |year=2002 |pmid=12477916 |pmc=1497444 |doi= 10.1016/S0033-3549(04)50171-1|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16131744"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramos EM, James CA, Bear-Lehman J |title=Children's computer usage: are they at risk of developing repetitive strain injury? |journal=Work |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=143–54 |year=2005 |pmid=16131744 |doi= |url= http://iospress.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;issn=1051-9815&amp;volume=25&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= pmid16552547&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zapata AL, Moraes AJ, Leone C, Doria-Filho U, Silva CA |title=Pain and musculoskeletal pain syndromes related to computer and video game use in adolescents |journal=Eur.

[[Ergonomy|Ergonomic]] measures could improve postural problems associated with video game playing.&lt;ref name= pmid16131744 /&gt;

A 2004 case report in ''[[The Lancet]]'', authored by a 9-year-old boy, mentions the [[Playstation thumb]], which features [[numbness]] and a [[blister]] caused by friction between the thumb and the controller from rapid game play.&lt;ref name="pmid15051306"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vaidya HJ |title=Playstation thumb |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9414 |page=1080 |date=March 2004 |pmid=15051306 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15865-0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16100887"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karim SA |title=Playstation thumb--a new epidemic in children |journal=S.

[[Nintendonitis]] has been used to describe tendon injuries ([[tendinosis]]) of the hands and wrists in Nintendo players.&lt;ref name="pmid11130299"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Macgregor DM |title=Nintendonitis?

A 2010 case report in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' reported a fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal after using a Wii balanceboard; this was dubbed a Wii fracture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eley KA | year = 2010 | title = A Wii Fracture | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/362/5/473 | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 362 | issue = 5| pages = 473–474 | doi=10.1056/nejmc0909544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further study involving musculoskeletal symptoms and computer use among Finnish adolescents affirmed the association between musculoskeletal symptoms and computer usage. The study claims that daily computer use of 2 hours or more increases the risk for pain at most anatomic sites.&lt;ref name="pmid22439805"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hakala PT, Saarni LA, Punamäki RL, Wallenius MA, Nygård CH, Rimpelä AH |title=Musculoskeletal symptoms and computer use among Finnish adolescents--pain intensity and inconvenience to everyday life: a cross-sectional study |journal= BMC Musculoskelet Disord |volume=13 |issue=41 |page= |date=March 2012|pmid=22439805 |doi= 10.1186/1471-2474-13-41|pages=41 |pmc=3348031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistently long sessions of video game play also leads to an increased likelihood of lower back pain, according to a study conducted in a population of school children. Children who played video games for more than 2 hours a day were more inclined to have lower back pain, however the same could not be said for those who watched television instead.&lt;ref name="pmid10664300"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gunzburg R, Balagué F, Nordin M, Szpalski M, Duyck D, Bull D, Mélot C |title=Low back pain in a population of school children. |journal= Eur Spine J |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages= 439–43 |year=1999 |pmid=10664300 |doi= 10.1007/s005860050202|pmc=3611220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vision problems ==
{{Expand section| date=December 2009}}

Video game playing may be associated with vision problems.&lt;ref name="pmid12441565"/&gt; Extensive viewing of the screen can cause eye strain, as the cornea, pupil, and iris are not intended for mass viewing sessions of electronic devices. Using video games for too long may also cause headaches, dizziness, and chances of vomiting from focusing on a screen. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

However, certain studies have shown that video games can be used to improve various eye conditions. An investigation into the effect of action gaming on spatial distribution of attention was conducted and revealed that gamers exhibited an enhancement with attention resources compared to non-gamers, not only in the periphery but also in central vision.&lt;ref name="pmid17154785"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Green CS, Bravelier D |title=Effect of action video games on the spatial distribution of visuospatial attention |journal=J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=1465–78 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17154785 |doi= 10.1037/0096-1523.32.6.1465|pmc=2896828}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies in 2011, concluded that a combination of video game therapy alongside occlusion therapy, would greatly improve the recovery of visual acuity in those experiencing [[amblyopia]].&lt;ref name="pmid21912514"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li RW, Ngo C, Nguyen J, Levi DM |title=Video-game play induces plasticity in the visual system of adults with amblyopia. |journal=PLoS Biol |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages= e1001135|date=August 2011 |pmid=21912514 |doi= 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001135 |pmc=3166159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epileptic seizures==
Concerns that video games can trigger [[epileptic seizure]]s began in the early 1980s, with the first medically documented case of a video game-induced seizure occurring in 1981.&lt;ref name= NGen10&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title= Do Video Games Screw You Up?|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=10|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=October 1995|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1993 ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' reported a boy choked to death on his own vomit during a seizure triggered by playing a video game; similar though less serious incidents were subsequently reported by news media around the world, and within a year all video game console manufacturers required that epilepsy warnings be included in the instruction manuals for all games published for their consoles.&lt;ref name= NGen10 /&gt;

Studies published in 1994 in ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'' and ''[[The Lancet]]'' found that video games only cause seizures in people already predisposed to [[epilepsy]], and that people with a predisposition to epilepsy can greatly reduce the risk of a seizure by staying 10 feet or more away from the TV set and wearing sunglasses while playing.&lt;ref name= NGen10 /&gt;

== Obesity == 
{{See also| Video game addiction}}
Video game play has been constantly associated with obesity. Many studies have been conducted on the link between television &amp; video games and increased BMI ([[Body Mass Index]]). Due to video games replacing physical activities, there appears to be a clear association between time spent playing video games and increased BMI in young children.&lt;ref name="pmid16793838"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carvalhal MM, Padez MC, Moreira PA, Rosado VM |title=Overweight and obesity related to activities in Portuguese children, 7-9 years |journal=Eur J Public Health |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=42–6 |date=June 2006|pmid=16793838 |doi= 10.1093/eurpub/ckl093|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such study produced data that indicated that boys who spend less than 1.5 hours on the television and playing video games, were 75.4% less likely to be overweight than those who spend more than 1.5 hours.&lt;ref name="pmid20557246"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rehbein F, Kleimann M, Mössle T |title=Prevalence and risk factors of video game dependency in adolescence: results of a German nationwide survey |journal=Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=269–77 |date=June 2010 |pmid= 20557246 |doi= 10.1089/cyber.2009.0227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in 2011 formalized the association of video game play and an increase in food intake in teens. A single session of video game play resulted in an increase in food intake, regardless of appetite.&lt;ref name= pmid21490141&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chaput JP, Visby T, Nyby S, Klingenberg L, Gregersen NT, Tremblay A, Astrup A, Sjödin A |title=Video game playing increases food intake in adolescents: a randomized crossover study |journal=Am J Clin Nutr |volume=93 |issue=6 |pages=1196–203 |date=June 2011|pmid=21490141 |doi= 10.3945/ajcn.110.008680 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recent trend of "[[active video game]]s" revolving around the Wii and Xbox Kinect might be a way to help combat the aforementioned problem however this finding still needs confirmation from other studies.&lt;ref name= pmid21562081&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maddison R, Foley L, Ni Mhurchu C, Jiang Y, Jull A, Prapavessis H, Hohepa M, Rodgers A |title=Effects of active video games on body composition: a randomized controlled trial |journal=Am J Clin Nutr |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=156–63 |date=July 2011|pmid=21562081 |doi=10.3945/ajcn.110.009142 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= pmid20603468&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Biddiss E, Irwin J |title=Active video games to promote physical activity in children and youth: a systematic review |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=164 |issue=7 |pages= 664–72 |date=July 2010|pmid=20603468 |doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2010.104 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a study conducted in Baylor College of Medicine revolving around children claims that there is no evidence which supports the belief that acquiring an active video game under naturalistic circumstance would result in a beneficial outcome toward children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3942">'''Wake therapy''' is a form of [[sleep deprivation]] used as a treatment for [[clinical depression|depression]]. The subject stays awake all night, or is woken at 1AM and stays awake all morning, and the next full day. While sleepy, patients find that their depression vanishes, until they sleep again. Combining this with bright [[light therapy]] make the beneficial effects last longer than one day.  Partial sleep deprivation in the second half of the night may be as effective as an all-night sleep deprivation session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wirz-Justice|first=A|author2=Benedetti F |author3=Berger M |author4=Lam RW |author5=Martiny K |author6=Terman M |author7=Wu JC |title=Chronotherapeutics (light and wake therapy) in affective disorders.|journal=Psychol.

Wake Therapy is a therapy that falls under chronotherapeutics. [[Chronotherapy (treatment scheduling)]] is a process to manipulate biological rhythms and sleep that can help to improve affective disorders quickly.

Wake therapy is beneficial for those experiencing major depression along with unipolar, bipolar, and melancholic types of depression.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Wake therapy is best used to jump start the effects of the use of an antidepressant. Wake therapy is the use of prolonged times of wakefulness, along with periods of recovering sleep. It is a fast way to improve symptoms of depression. This therapy is best used with other chronotherapeutic techniques. Months of use of this therapy and other therapies can be quite effective to help prevent relapse of depression.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Procedure==
Wake therapy involves one to three rounds which consist of complete sleep avoidance for the night and entire day after, then the cycles are separated with nights of recovery sleep (a full night's sleep). The treatment lasts between two and five days, depending on the number of rounds done. Relapse into depression typically occurs immediately after any amount of sleep. The intervention is done in a hospital or sleep center in order to make sure the program is done properly and full effects are established.&lt;ref&gt;Martiny, K. (2010).

'''Walter Mittelholzer''' (April 2, 1894 – May 9, 1937) was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[aviation]] pioneer. He was active as a pilot, photographer, travel writer, and also as one of the first aviation [[entrepreneur]]s.

== Life ==
Born on April 2, 1894 in [[St. Gallen]]  in Mittelholzer earned his private pilot's license in 1917, and in 1918 he completed his instruction as a military pilot.

On November 5, 1919 he co-founded an air-photo and passenger flight business, ''[[Alfred Comte|Comte]], Mittelholzer, and Co.'' In 1920 this firm merged with the financially stronger [[Ad Astra Aero]]. Mittelholzer was the director and head pilot of Ad Astra Aero which later became [[Swissair]].

He made the first North-South flight across [[Africa]]. It took him 77 days. Mittelholzer started in [[Zürich]] on December 7, 1926, flying via [[Alexandria]] and landing in [[Cape Town]] on February 21, 1927.  Earlier, he had been the first to do serious aerial reconnaissance of [[Spitsbergen]], in a [[Junkers]] [[monoplane]], in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The MENA region covers roughly 11.1 million square km. There are three major deserts in the MENA region:&lt;ref name="abuzeid2006"&gt;{{cite web |title=Water Conflict and Conflict Management Mechanisms in the Middle East and North Africa |url=http://water.cedare.int/cedare.int/files15%5CFile2862.pdf |publisher=Centre for Environment and Development for the Arab Region and Europe |author1=Khaled AbuZeid |author2=Amr Abdel-Meguid |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, much of [[Iran]] is covered in desert. Average annual rainfall is less than 100&amp;nbsp;mm in 65% of the region, between 100 and 300&amp;nbsp;mm in 15% of the region, and more than 300mm in the remaining region.&lt;ref name="abuzeid2006"/&gt;

==Jordan River Basin==

===Water resources===
[[File:Middle East Topographic Political EN.svg|thumb|left|Satellite map of the Middle East.]]
The three headwaters of the Jordan River – the [[Hasbani River]] (annual stable flow of 250 Mm^3), the [[Banias River]] (annual stable flow of 125 Mm^3), and the [[Dan River (Middle East)|
Dan River]] (annual stable flow of 250 Mm^3) originate in [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], and [[Israel]], respectively.&lt;ref name="alazhar1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ju'ub|first=Dr. Ghassan Abu|title=Water Conflicts in the Middle East Between the Present and the Future|url=http://www.alazhar.edu.ps/arabic/centers/IWE/Researches/GazaPaper-new/water.pdf|publisher=Al-Azhar University}}&lt;/ref&gt; They merge in [[Lake Huleh]] and then flow south as the Jordan River. Just south of [[Tiberias]], the [[Yarmuk River]] joins the Jordan River. In total, the Jordan River flows for roughly 350&amp;nbsp;km, starting in the foothills of [[Mount Hermon]] in the north and ending in the [[Dead Sea]] to the south.&lt;ref name="alazhar1"/&gt; The River has an estimated flow of 1880 MCM/Y, 73 percent of which originates in Arab countries and 27 percent of which originates in Israel.&lt;ref name="kiser59"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiser|first=Stephen|title=WATER:  THE HYDRAULIC  PARAMETER OF CONFLICT IN  THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH  AFRICA|journal=USAF Institute for National Security Studies|date=September 2000|series=INSS Occasional Papers|issue=35|pages=59|url=http://www.usafa.edu/df/inss/OCP/ocp35.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a September 2000 USAF study, over 90% of Syria’s water is shared with neighboring [[Iraq]], [[Turkey]], Israel, Lebanon, and [[Jordan]].&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; Approximately 36 percent of Jordan’s water sources are shared with Syria, the [[West Bank]], and Israel, and more than half of Israel’s waters is shared with Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the West Bank.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt;

Further north, the [[Litani River]] and Orontes River comprise the northern [[Levant]] watershed.  Although their headwaters are geographically close, the Litani flows south then west to the Mediterranean near [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], crossing through Lebanon alone, while the Orontes flows north into Syria, entering the Mediterranean around the city of [[Antioch]].&lt;ref name="alazhar1"/&gt; The Litani's estimated annual flow of 410 MCM/Y has been the target of proposed Syrian, Jordanian, and Israeli water solutions.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt;

Syria, Lebanon, and Israel all have indigenous underground fresh water aquifers.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; There are two main underground aquifers that provide fresh water to modern day Israel. The Mountain Aquifer is underneath the West Bank. It recharges 679 Mm^3 of water annually, of which 78 Mm^3 are brackish.&lt;ref name="alazhar1"/&gt; The Mountain Aquifer’s three main basins are the Eastern Basin, the Western Basin, and the Northeastern Basin. The Eastern Basin is the smallest in terms of fresh water quantities, but largest in terms of area. It covers roughly 3260&amp;nbsp;km^2.&lt;ref name="alazhar1"/&gt; The Western Basin is the largest of the three in terms of fresh water content. It covers roughly 1780&amp;nbsp;km^2.&lt;ref name="alazhar1"/&gt; Finally, the Northeastern Basin has an area of roughly 610&amp;nbsp;km^2.&lt;ref name="alazhar1"/&gt; The Coastal Aquifer located along the Mediterranean Coast has a total annual recharge of 330 Mm^3.&lt;ref name="alazhar1"/&gt;

The area around the Jordan River Basin is one of the driest in the world. Israel and northwestern Jordan receive an average of 110&amp;nbsp;cm of rainfall per year.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; Little of this water can be exploited. Only [[Kuwait]], [[Libya]], [[Oman]], and [[Singapore]] receive less rain annually than Jordan or Israel. Syria and Lebanon, in contrast, receive enough rainfall to support agriculture and recharge underground aquifers.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; As stated earlier, while northern parts of Jordan and Israel receive 110&amp;nbsp;cm of annual rainfall, central Jordan and the West Bank receive 20 mcm/y. Only 3 mcm/y of this water is usable, however.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt;

===Water consumption===
Israel uses roughly 850 MCM/Y of groundwater, 400 MCM/Y of which come from the Mountain Aquifer. In 1964, Israel began to withdraw 320 MCM/Y from the Jordan River for the [[National Water Carrier]]. By 1967, Israel’s National Water Carrier was extracting almost 70 percent of the Jordan River before it reached the [[Palestinians]] in the West Bank.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; In the 1980s, Israeli settlers consumed seven times more water than Arab farmers. Other sources show a smaller, yet still sizeable difference. Per a September 2000 study, Israel uses 1180 MCM/Y, or 62 percent of its total annual water supply on agriculture. In comparison, Jordan uses 67 MCM/Y, or 74 percent of its total water supply on agriculture.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; Roughly 48 percent of Israel’s average annual water usage of 1,950 MCM/Y comes from territory captured in 1967. 400 MCM/Y of this comes from ground water in the West Bank, while 450 MCM/Y comes from the upper Jordan River and the [[Golan Heights]].&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; As early as 1981, however, Israel was exploiting 99 percent of its available water resources.

===Water Supply Systems===

====British Mandate Period (1917–1948)====
At the time of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] (1913–148), three irrigation systems existed along the eastern slopes of the [[Judaean Mountains]]. The [[Wadi Qelt]] aqueduct provided 3 MCM/Y of fresh water to [[Jericho]] from the Ein Fara, Ein Fawar, and Ein Qelt springs.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; Additionally, the Wadi Uja aqueduct supplied the Uja Valley with 7 MCM/Y of fresh water from the Ein Uja spring and the Wadi Faria aqueduct transported 5 MCM/Y of water from the Ein Shibli, Ein Isca, and Ein Baidan springs to the Giftlik.&lt;ref name="gvirtzmanil"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gvirtzman|first=Haim|title=The Israeli-Palestinian Water Conflict: An Israeli Perspective|url=http://www.biu.ac.il/SOC/besa/MSPS94.pdf|publisher=The Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Roman rule, the Nablus and Jerusalem aqueducts were also active in the Judea and [[Samaria]] Mountains. These aqueducts brought a combined additional 3 MCM/Y to [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sabastia]] and [[Jerusalem]]. During the Mandate, another 200 small groundwater springs were used and rainwater was collected from cisterns, yielding an additional 5 MCM/Y of fresh water during rainy years.&lt;ref name="gvirtzmanil"/&gt; With the addition of two electric power plants supplying an addition 2 MCM/Y to Jerusalem and [[Ramallah]], the maximum water capacity in the Judea and Samaria Mountains was 25 MCM/Y.&lt;ref name="gvirtzmanil"/&gt; [[File:Lasjalomne023 (7).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Lake Tiberias.| Lake Tiberias]]

Several plans attempted to allocate the water resources of the region during the British Mandate. The Ionides Plan of 1939 made three recommendations. First, it proposed to store the floodwaters of the Yarmouk River in [[Lake Tiberias]] (Sea of Galilea).&lt;ref name="isaac1992"&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaac|first=Jad|title=Roots of the Water Conflict in the Middle East|url=http://web.macam.ac.il/~arnon/Int-ME/water/Roots%20of%20the%20Water%20Conflict%20in%20the%20Middle%20East.htm|publisher=Applied Research Institute – Jerusalem|author2=Leonardo Hosh |date=7–9 May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, it set and amount of the water in the lake to be diverted through the East Ghor Canal and used for irrigation east of the Jordan River.&lt;ref name="isaac1992"/&gt; Third, it limited the use of Jordan River Basin water to the Jordan River Valley.&lt;ref name="isaac1992"/&gt; This was rejected by Zionist advocates who envisioned using waters from the Jordan River Basin to settle the [[Negev Desert]] in the south of the country. In contrast, the Lowdermilk Plan, commissioned by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], proposed irrigating the Jordan River Valley and diverting the Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers for hydroelectric power.&lt;ref name="isaac1992"/&gt; In 1948, James B. Hays used the findings in Lowdermilk as a basis for the Hays Plan in which the Yarmouk River was to be diverted into [[Lake Tiberias]] to compensate for the waters lost in the diversion of the Jordan River for agricultural purposes.&lt;ref name="isaac1992"/&gt;

====Jordanian Rule (1948–1967)====
In 1948 Israel officially became a state. The Kingdom of Jordan assumed control of the water resources of the Judea and Samaria Mountains. They retained control over the region until the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. Additional wells drilled during this period and the maximum water supply in the region reached 66 MCM/Y.&lt;ref name="gvirtzmanil"/&gt; Only four of 708 Palestinian towns, however, were connected to the water supply at the time.&lt;ref name="gvirtzmanil"/&gt; In 1965 an additional 350 wells were drilled, supplying a total of 41 MCM/Y.&lt;ref name="gvirtzmanil"/&gt;
In the [[Israeli War of Independence]] (1948) the Jewish Army destroyed the Rutenburg electric plant in trying to prevent the exclusive Arab control of both the Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers.&lt;ref name="isaac1992"/&gt; As a direct result the Jordanian Government and the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] commission the MacDonald Plan, which resembled the Ionides Plan (1939) in limiting the waters of the Jordan River Basin to the Jordan River Valley. It also called for a diversion of the Yarmouk River for storage in Lake Tiberias to be used to support agricultural developments on both sides of the Jordan River.&lt;ref name="isaac1992"/&gt; Jordan and Syria backed the Bunger Plan, which proposed a dam of the Yarmouk River and the creation of two hydroelectric power plants to supply electricity to Jordan and Syria. In 1953, shortly after construction had started, increased pressure from the U.S. forced Jordan and Syria to abandon their plans.&lt;ref name="isaac1992"/&gt; The Eisenhower Administration sent Eric Johnston as a special envoy. The [[Johnston Plan]] implemented the policies of a [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] study conducted by Chales Main – the Main Plan – that included water distribution quotas of the Jordan River Basin.&lt;ref name="isaac1992"/&gt; Although neither side accepted the plan, it has been used as the basis for many subsequent water conflict negotiations.

====Israeli Administration (1967–present)====
When Israel occupied the West Bank in the Six-Day-War 1967, the water resources of the region were declared as state property. The occupation has huge impacts on the daily lives of the Palestinian people and their water supply:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Palestinian Water: Resources, Use, Conservation, Climate Change, and Land Use|last = Hassan, M.A., McIntyre G.|first = |date = 2012|journal = Digest of Middle East Studies |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=313–326|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Jordan Valley: a case study profile. Part of CLICO project tasks.|last = Tamimi, A., Abu Jamous, S.|first = |date = 2012|journal = Unpublished CLICO deliverable.|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many aspects the occupation implicates breaches of international law, such as the international human rights law or the international humanitarian law. Especially the land confiscations and property demolitions by the Israeli military as well as the restrictions on the movement of people and goods are criticized. Since 1967, most water sources are controlled by the Israeli military. Moreover, water resources are diverted and the Palestinian population is denied access to most water resources. In the same time, Israel claims that the Palestinians drill unauthorized wells. Large parts of the Palestinian water infrastructure, including cisterns, wells, and irrigation systems, are declared as illegal and systematically demolished. As the development of new Palestinian water infrastructures is mostly prohibited, the Palestinian water supply systems are in a very poor condition. In that way, they are reflecting the weak and ambiguous political status of Palestine. As most people in the West Bank depend on agriculture, the Palestinian water deficit is also weakening the local economy. Thereby it is strongly contributing to poverty and unemployment. The unbalanced water allocation in the Palestinian territories shaped the term of "water apartheid".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = When the rivers run dry: What happens when our water runs out?|last = Pearce, F.|first = |publisher = Eden Project Books.|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though it is difficult to get accurate data, the average Israeli water consumption in the West Bank is about 6 times higher than the average Palestinian water consumption of approximately 50 liters/person/day, what is about the half of the World Health Organization minimum recommended level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, there are other data showing a different picture. By excluding treated sewage and
desalinated water and using a different type of demographic data, Gvirtzman&lt;ref name="gvirtzmanil" /&gt; (2012) for instance argues that the average Israeli and the average Palestinian water consumption is nowadays almost the same. The huge differences in the Israeli and Palestinian water data illustrate how contested and urgent the question of water allocation still is.

Until today, there is no final agreement granting water rights to the Palestinian population. Although water questions were a topic in the Oslo Peace Process, the water dispute was not solved through the negotiations. Indeed, Article 40 of the "Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip" (1995) deals with the Palestinian water rights, but it states that "these will be negotiated in the permanent status negotiations and settled in the Permanent Status Agreement relating to the various water resources".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Peace/Guide/Pages/THE%20ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN%20INTERIM%20AGREEMENT%20-%20Annex%20III.aspx#app-40|title = The Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip - Annex III.|date = 1995|accessdate = 2015-11-25|website = |publisher = Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, "during the interim period a total quantity of 28.6 mcm/year" will be allocated to the Palestinian population "in order to meet the immediate needs [..] in fresh water for domestic use".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In reality, due to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian tensions, a Permanent Status Agreement was never negotiated. Therefore, the agreement indirectly maintained Israeli domination over water resources and handled the issue of water deficit in the occupied Palestinian territories as a matter of humanitarian need rather than a right.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Moreover, the Israeli-Palestinian Joint Water Commission (JWC) was established to implement the agreement in a collaborative way.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Hydrological, Engineering, Sewage, and Pricing Committees of the JWC meet on a regular basis to approve the construction of water supply systems or sewage installations. As a part of that agreement, Israel transferred the control of the water supply in the Palestinian territories to the Palestinian Authority. Nevertheless, the Palestinian Authority is hardly able to fulfill its responsibilities, as Israeli members of the Joint Water Commission are able to veto any Palestinian project. Furthermore, the members of the Palestinian Authority are unable to access most areas as they are denied access by the military. The result is, that more than 33% of the water supplied to the Palestinian territories "leaks from internal pipelines".&lt;ref name="gvirtzmanil" /&gt; Both sides contest that the laws established in Oslo are no longer being followed. As the Palestinian population is not allocated enough water, the work of the Joint Water Commission can be considered as insufficient.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Nile River Basin==

===Water resources===
[[File:Egypt Nil.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Nile River.| Nile River in Egypt]]
The [[Nile River]] is an international water basin, running through 10 different sovereign nations.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; The Nile runs through [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], [[Burundi]], [[Rwanda]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Egypt]] and is considered to be the longest river in the world. The Nile is the only significant source of water in North Africa and 40% of Africa’s population lives in the [[Nile River Basin]].&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; The Nile has two major tributaries: the [[White Nile]] and the [[Blue Nile]]. The White Nile is the longer of the two, rising in the Great Lakes Region of central Africa. Its most distant source is unknown, located in either Burundi or Rwanda. From there, it flows through Tanzania, [[Lake Victoria]], Uganda, and South Sudan. The Blue Nile originates from Ethiopia’s [[Lake Tana]], flowing into Sudan from the southeast. In total, Ethiopian headwaters provides 86% of Nile River waters.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; The two major tributaries meet near the Sudanese capital of [[Khartoum]] and flow north through Egypt and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

===Sudanese Civil War===
Access to key resources, mainly water, is a primary source of the Civil War in Sudan. Ecologically, Sudan is divided into a northern and southern region. The North is densely populated with Arab Muslims. Although the Nile flows through the northern part of Sudan, it is largely beyond the drainage basins of the feeder streams and rivers that consolidate themselves into the White and Blue Niles further to the south.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; The South is lightly populated, but much more fertile. It receives adequate rainfall and benefits from many feeder streams and springs scattered throughout the area.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; Persistent drought and desertification, population expansion, and the need to increase food output have forced many northern Arabs to look south for lands and resources. The introduction by the North of mechanized farming equipment continues to threaten southern subsistence farming. Organized as the [[Sudan People’s Liberation Army]] (SPLA),&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; southerners have fought back against northern intrusion for the better part of three decades.

Water conflict in Sudan typically concerns canal building or farming projects. One of the more notable sources of conflict has been the [[Jonglei Canal]] project, begun in 1978. The project was started for two primary reasons: to drain the Sudd Swamps to create additional farmland and to conserve the water being evaporated as it sat idle in the swamps.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; The amount lost through evaporation was estimated at 4000 mcm/y.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; Both the Sudanese and Egyptian governments supported the project as both would share in the benefits of additional water. The Jonglei Canal is massive enough to be seen from space. It averages 210&amp;nbsp;feet in width and 16&amp;nbsp;feet in depth.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt;
Drainage of the wetlands threatened the roughly 1.7 million local tribesmen that depended on the swamps for survival and in November 1974, locals rioted in the southern city of [[Juba]].&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; Southerners began to flock to the SPLA, which led violent attacks on construction sites along the Jonglei Canal. They eventually forced the suspension of the project in 1984. 250 of 360&amp;nbsp;km of canal had been built.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt;

The incursion of northern mechanized farming in southern Sudan has also caused conflict. The Arab-dominated government envisioned agricultural development in the South and northern farmers continually encroached upon the fertile southern plains. Such encroachment threatened the [[Nilotic]] tribes, who ran the cattle economies of the south.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; Southerners responded to northern incursion with hostility and violence.

Conflict again broke out between the northern government and the Sudanese people concerning the government’s decision to build the Kajbar Dam on the Nile. The resulting reservoir would have forced the relocation of the last remaining [[Nubian people|Nubian]] tribes in the Sudan.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; Much of the Nubian homeland had already been flooded after the [[Aswan High Dam]] was built by Egypt in the 1950s. Many Sudanese protested the building of the Kajbar, with members of the Nubain Alliance even threatening mass suicide in protest.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; They have declined offers of compensation from the Sudanese government.

===Regional conflicts===
Aside from a source of internal conflict within nations, water has caused external tension between sovereign states. While Egypt consumes 99% of the Nile’s water supply,&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; little water originates within Egypt’s sovereign borders. High water demands of a lower riparian have often fueled regional conflict. Such is the case in North Africa.

In the early 1900s, a world cotton shortage put pressure on Egypt and Sudan to use arable lands to increase cotton production.&lt;ref name="usaid1"&gt;{{cite web|last = Wolf|first = Aaron|title = Middle East Water Conflicts and Directions for Conflict Resolution|url = http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABY541.pdf|publisher = International Food Policy Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton, however, requires extensive irrigation and is less suitable to Egyptian and Sudanese climate than are other more traditional crops. The need for water and flood control precipitated water development projects along the Nile, which often led to clashes between the British foreign office – Sudan was a British-Egyptian condominium at the time – and local Egyptians and Sudans.&lt;ref name="usaid1"/&gt; After World War I it became apparent that a formal allocations treaty would need to be signed to regulate water usage of the Nile. In 1920, the Nile Projects Commission was formed.&lt;ref name="usaid1"/&gt; Led by representatives from India, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the commission estimated water usage based on the water usage needs of each country. Based on an average flow rate of 84 bcm/y the commission estimated necessary Egyptian consumption to be 58 bcm/y, while Sudan was believed to be able to meet its irrigation needs using only the waters of the Blue Nile.&lt;ref name="usaid1"/&gt; The commission also proposed dividing any deviations from the annual average water flow equally between Egypt and Sudan. The findings of the commission, however, were never acted upon. Also in 1920, the British proposed the Century Storage Scheme, the most comprehensive plan for water development along the Nile.&lt;ref name="usaid1"/&gt; The plan called for a water storage facility to be built on the Uganda-Sudan border, a dam to be built at Sennar, Sudan, to irrigate the regions south of Sudan, and a dam along the White Nile to hold summer floodwaters for Egyptian dry-season consumption.&lt;ref name="usaid1"/&gt; The British scheme worried many Egyptians, as most of the major water structures were to be built outside of Egyptian territory. On May 7, 1929, Egypt and Sudan signed the Nile Waters Agreement. Based largely on findings from the 1920 commission, the treaty allocated 4 bcm/y to Sudan, and 48 bcm/y to Egypt. In between January 20 and July 15, however, the entire flow of the Nile was allocated for Egyptian consumption.&lt;ref name="usaid1"/&gt;

In the 1950s, Egypt unilaterally pursued construction of the Aswan High Dam until 1954, when the Sudanese was brought in on the negotiations. The first round of negotiations between Egypt and Sudan took place in December 1954, but was called off before a consensus could be reached.&lt;ref name="usaid1"/&gt; The two governments met again in April 1955, again failing to reach a compromise. Tensions mounted in 1958 after a failed Egyptian expedition into disputed territory along the Sudanese border. In response, Sudan raised the [[Sennar Dam]] in the summer of 1959, effectively repudiating the 1929 agreement signed with Egypt.&lt;ref name="usaid1"/&gt; The two countries signed the Agreement for the Full Utilization of the Nile Waters (Nile Waters Treaty) on November 8, 1959.&lt;ref name="usaid1"/&gt; The Nile Waters Treaty, based on an average annual water flow of 84 bcm/y provided the following:&lt;ref name="usaid1"/&gt;
* 55.5 bcm/y to Egypt, 18.5 bcm/y to Sudan.
* Any derivations from the average annual water flow were to be divided equally between Egypt and Sudan.
* Until 1977, Sudan would "loan" Egypt an additional 1.5 bcm/y.
* Any future developments that led to an increase in Nile water flow would be paid for equally between the two nations. Any resulting water was also to be split evenly between them.
* Egypt would repay Sudan 15 million British Pounds in compensation for past flooding that resulted from Egyptian water development projects.
Additionally, the 1959 treaty established a Permanent Joint Technical Committee to resolve any future conflicts. Both Sudan and Egypt agreed that the water needs of the other eight riparians would not exceed 1 to 2 bcm/y and further agreed to meet any threat to Nile resources with a unified Egyptian-Sudanese response.&lt;ref name="usaid1"/&gt; The building of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s was contentious as it flooded areas of southern Sudan near [[Wadi Halfa]] and displaced Sudanese residents living along the Egyptian-Sudanese border.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt;
[[File:MeroweDam-NASA.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A Merowe Dam.| The Merowe Dam, as seen from space.]]
In the mid 1990s Egypt began a massive project just south of the Aswan. The New Delta Project in southern Egypt and the Salaam Canal in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] were both initiatives undertaken by former Egyptian president [[Hosni Mubarak]] to increase water supply for the expanding Egyptian population, which has dispersed further and further from the Nile.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; Increasing Egyptian water consumption is a source of conflict in the region as upstream riparians – Sudan and Ethiopia – have begun to assert their own rights to dam the river for hydroelectric development. Sudanese plans to build the Kajbar Dam near Khartoum at the confluence of the White and Blue Niles &lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; has caused much international tension. Sudan is also planning on building the [[Merowe Dam]] south of the Kajbar and enlarging the [[Roseires Dam]], located 300&amp;nbsp;miles southeast of Khartoum on the Blue Nile.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; It is estimated that the building of these projects would likely lead to Sudan exceeding its water allotments from the 1959 treaty.

Ethiopia has also emerged as a major player in Nile River development. In 1957 they announced their intentions to pursue unilaterally the development of Nile River headwaters within Ethiopian territory. By the year 2000, more than 200 small dams had been constructed along Nile headwaters. Collectively, the dams will use nearly 500 million mcm/y of the Nile’s annual flow.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt; Ethiopia is the only Nile River riparian to make a legal claim to Nile waters other than Egypt or Sudan since the Nile Waters Treaty was signed in 1959. Like in Egypt, population growth in Ethiopia has led to an increase in water consumption. Ethiopian population growth exceeds that of Egypt, and with populations of roughly equal size, Ethiopia’s water demands may soon exceed Egypt’s. Irrigating only half of Ethiopia’s arable lands would reduce water flow to downstream Sudan and Egypt by 15%.&lt;ref name="kiser59"/&gt;

==Tigris-Euphrates River Basin==

===Water resources===
[[File:Satellite image of Syria in May 2003.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Syria| The Euphrates River in Syria.]]The Tigris-Euphrates River Basin consists of its two primary rivers – The [[Tigris River]] and the [[Euphrates River]] – and their minor tributaries. Both the Tigris and the Euphrates originate in southeastern Turkey. The Tigris flows from Turkey, tracing the border between Turkey and Syria for 32&amp;nbsp;km before flowing south through [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name="alazhar1"/&gt; From its origin in Turkey, the Euphrates flows into Syria from the north, before continuing on through Iraq.&lt;ref name="alazhar1"/&gt; The two rivers meet in Iraq to form the [[Shatt Al-Arab]], which flows south into the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref name="alazhar1"/&gt;

===Regional conflict===
Although hydropolitical tensions in the region have existed for centuries, population pressures in the 1960s led each country to pursue unilateral development of water resources. The [[Keban Dam]] was built in southern [[Anatolia]] from 1965 to 1973 and Syria built its [[Tabqa Dam]] between 1965 and 1973.&lt;ref name="usaid1"/&gt; Despite bilateral and sometimes tripartite (including the Soviet Union) negotiations, no formal agreements were in place when the two dams became operational in 1973. As the dams began to fill, downstream water flow decreased significantly. In 1974, Syria granted an Iraqi request and allowed an additional 200 mcm/year to flow from the Tabqa Dam. The following year, however, Iraq asked for [[Arab League]] intervention, citing that the flow of water reaching Iraq had fallen from the normal 920 m³/s to an "intolerable" 197 m³/s.&lt;ref name="usaid1"/&gt; The Syrian government responded by claiming that water flow into Syria had been reduced by more than 50%.[[File:Ataturk dam 1-GAP.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The Ataturk Dam.| The Ataturk Dam along the Euphrates River]] After trading mutually hostile statements, Syria withdrew from an Arab League committee tasked with resolving the dispute. Tension increased in May 1975 as Syria closed its airspace to Iraqi flights and both countries amassed troops on their borders.&lt;ref name="usaid1"/&gt; Saudi Arabian intervention, however, defused the situation with both sides arriving at an agreement that averted the impending violence. The terms of the agreement were never made public, but Iraqi sources have privately said that Syria was permitted to keep 40% of the water in the Euphrates flowing through its country, while 60% of the water was to be allowed to flow south through Iraq.&lt;ref name="usaid1"/&gt;

The [[Southeastern Anatolia Project]] (Turkish acronym: GAP) continues to be a source of tension in the region. GAP is a massive hydroelectric project, consisting of 21 dams and 19 hydroelectric facilities.&lt;ref name="usaid1"/&gt; The water will be used to generate 26 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity with an installed capacity of 7,500 megawatts and irrigate 1.65 million hectares of land.&lt;ref name="usaid1"/&gt; In 1987, Turkish Prime Minister [[Turgut Ozal]] reportedly signed an agreement guaranteeing a minimum flow of 500 mcm/y into Syria. Talks between Turkey, Syria, and Iraq were held again in January 1990 when Turkey shut off the flow of the Euphrates for 30 days by closing the gates of the [[Ataturk Dam]]. Iraq insisted that Turkey allow a minimum of 500 mcm/y to pass into Syria, but negotiations were suspended due to the outbreak of the first [[Gulf War]]. Negotiations after the war in September 1992 failed to reach an agreement.&lt;ref name="usaid1"/&gt;

==Blue Peace==
The Blue Peace method which seeks to transforms trans-boundary water issues into instruments for cooperation has proven to be effective in cases like the [http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/40595Blue%20Peace_Middle%20East.pdf Middle East] and the [http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/84153Blue%20Peace%20for%20the%20Nile.pdf Nile basin].  This unique approach to turn tensions around water into opportunities for socio-economic development was developed by Strategic Foresight Group in partnership with the Governments of Switzerland and Sweden. A recent report "Water Cooperation for a Secure World" published by Strategic Foresight Group shows that active water cooperation between countries reduces the risk of war. This conclusion is reached after examining trans-boundary water relations in over 200 shared river basins in 148 countries.Countries in the Middle East face the risk of war as they have avoided regional cooperation for too long. The report provides examples of successful cooperation, which can be used by countries in the Middle East.

The challenges of water security have a great human costs and a much larger impact on the Middle East. Water insecurity is always accompanied by one or more issues such as poverty, war and conflict, low women’s development and environmental degradation.&lt;ref&gt;http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/environment/water-cooperation-key-to-ensuring-peace-1.1475648&lt;/ref&gt; These devastating effects have been documented in two reports release in 2015: ‘The Hydro Insecure: Crisis of Survival in the Middle East’ and ' Water and Violence: Crisis of Survival in the Middle East'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americansecurityproject.org/the-middle-east-struggles-with-water-security/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water supply and sanitation in Jamaica''' is characterized by high levels of access to an [[improved water source]], while access to adequate sanitation stands at only 80%. This situation affects especially the poor, including the urban poor many of which live in the country's over 595 unplanned squatter settlements in unhealthy and unsanitary environments with a high risk of [[waterborne disease]]. Despite a number of policy papers that were mainly focused on water supply and despite various projects funded by external donors, increases in access have remained limited (1% for water and 5% for sanitation between 1990 and 2004).

The responsibility for water and sanitation policies within the government rests with the Ministry of Water and Housing, and the main service provider is the National Water Commission. An autonomous regulatory agency, the Office of Utilities Regulation, approves tariffs and establishes targets for efficiency increases.

In urban areas, where 52% of Jamaica’s population lives, access to improved water supply is 98% access to improved sanitation is 91%.  Only 31% of the urban population is connected to sewers. In rural areas access stands at 88% for improved water supply and 69% for improved sanitation. Overall, access to improved water supply in Jamaica stands at 93% and access to improved sanitation is currently at 80%.

Between 1990 and 2004 access only increased slightly by 1% for water by 5% for sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/JAMAICAEXTN/0,,menuPK:338345~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:338335,00.html World Bank Jamaica Country Brief], based on data from the WHO/UNICEF JMP&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service quality ==
Many homes receive water only at low pressure. Many rural communities receive water that is not or only irregularly chlorinated. According to the 2011 Population and Housing Census, 69 percent of Jamaica's households receive untreated drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;Jamaica Observer:Majority of Jamaicans Drink Unclean Water, 24 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table summarizes the results of the water tested from the 11 major surface sources and 6 wells of the National Water Commission (NWC) as compared to the standards set by the Ministry of Health (MOH).

Most of the country's over 595 unplanned squatter settlements&lt;ref&gt;Sanitation Policy&lt;/ref&gt; or approximately 10% of the population is located nearby unhealthy and unsanitary environments without piped water or sanitation where there is a high risk of waterborne diseases. The vulnerability to natural disasters threatens the existing water and sanitation systems. Furthermore, there is a heightened probability of contamination of systems following hurricanes due to service interruption as well as the incidence of health-related diseases.

== Infrastructure ==

The National Water Commission (NWC), which produces more than 90% of Jamaica's total potable water supply, operates a network of more than 160 wells, over 116 river sources (via water treatment plants) and 147 springs. The various Parish Councils and a small number of private water companies supply the rest of the potable water. The NWC operates more than 1,000 water supply and over 100 sewerage facilities islandwide. These vary from large raw water storage reservoirs at Hermitage and Mona in St. Andrew and the Great River treatment plant in St. James, to medium-sized and small diesel-driven pumping installations serving rural towns and villages across Jamaica. The NWC facilities also include over 4,000 kilometres of pipelines and more than 500 kilometres of sewer mains across the island. NWC supplies some 190 million gallons of potable water each day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwcjamaica.com/Corporate_Profile.asp National Water Commission:Corporate Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibility for water supply and sanitation ==

=== Policy and regulation ===
'''Policy institutions''' The '''Ministry of Water and Housing''' (MWH) is responsible for setting water and sanitation policies. It is also in charge of ensuring that all housing developments meet required standards for sanitation. The '''Ministry of Health''' develops and implements health policies and legislation to promote appropriate sanitation practices; establishes and monitors health indicators for sanitation, enforces public health laws, provides public education on sanitation and hygiene. The '''National Environment and Planning Agency''' (NEPA) determines and monitors environmental standards for water supply and sanitation. Local Authorities have only a limited role in the sector.

The following water agencies operate under the supervision of the Ministry of Water and Housing
 
* The National Water Commission, in charge water supply and sanitation
* The Rural Water Supply Company, formerly Carib Engineering Corporation Limited (CECL)
* The Water Resource Authority

The '''Water Resources Authority''' (WRA) is responsible for the management, protection, and controlled allocation and use of Jamaica's water resources. The WRA maintains a hydrological database and provides data, information, and technical assistance to government and non-government institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wra.gov.jm/ Water Resource Authority]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Policies''' Some of the existing policies related to water supply and sanitation are:
* The Water Sector Policy Paper (1999) "outlines the current situation and problems within the water sector , defines the objectives of the Government to address the issues, and sets out the mode of implementation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wra.gov.jm/dynaweb.dti?dynasection=history&amp;dynapage=water_policy Water Sector Policy Paper 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The National Solid Waste Management Policy (2000) establishes the framework for standard setting and regulatory agency, the National Solid Waste Management Authority which facilitates the private sector as the principal service provider. The policy also indicates cost recovery provision as key, establishments of sanitary landfills, and solid waste management.
* The draft National sanitation policy for Jamaica of 2005 notes that there are overlapping responsibilities at the national and local levels of government and a need for greater collaboration between [[NGO]]s, Community-based organizations, community members, as well as the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsacd/cd48/Sanitation_Policy.pdf National sanitation policy for Jamaica (draft)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Water Sector Policy, Strategy and Action Plan (2004) has as its main objective to ensure that all households have access to water by 2010, sewer all major towns by 2020, as well as rehabilitate existing non-compliant facilities to achieve compliance with national environmental standards.
* The Rural Water Supply Master Plan, announced in 2008, is currently under elaboration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jis.gov.jm/water_housing/html/20080501t100000-0500_15012_jis_rural_water_supply_master_plan_being_developed.asp Ministry of Water&amp;Housing:Rural Water Supply Master Plan Being Developed], 1 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regulation''' The Office of Utilities Regulation (OUR), established by an Act of Parliament in 1995, regulates, among others, water and sanitation service provision. The Office approves tariffs, sets targets for efficiency improvements, processes all license applications for utility services and makes recommendations to the Minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.our.org.jm/ Office of Utilities Regulation]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service provision ===
Water service on the island is provided by one large public entity and three small private companies:
* The National Water Commission (NWC) is the main institution responsible for all major water and sewerage operations, including: production of water and collection, treatment and disposal of urban sewage. Provision for rural water is shared between the NWC and the [[Parishes of Jamaica|Parish Councils]].
* The smaller private service providers are: Four Rivers Development, Runaway Bay Water Co., Rio Bueno Water Co, among others. The three provide 10-year non-exclusive licenses.
Sanitation services are provided by NWC, Can Cara Development Company and Rosehall Utilities Company.&lt;ref&gt;OUR Annual Report 2006, p. 49 [http://www.our.org.jm/new/PDF-FILES/annualreport/OUR_Annual_Report_2005-2006.pdf OUR]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
The Jamaica Social Investment Fund finances community-based water and sanitation projects.

== Economic efficiency ==
The water and sanitation infrastructure is inadequate and inefficiently operated, as the level of [[Non-revenue water]] for the NWC was 66% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;OUR Annual Report 2005-2006, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, service providers produced 277 million cubic meters of water, but only 103 million cubic meters were consumed.&lt;ref&gt;OUR Annual Report 2005-2006, p. 47. The report makes reference to megaliters (Ml); each Ml (one million liters) is equivalent to 1,000 cubic meters&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial aspects==

=== Tariffs and cost recovery ===

'''Cost recovery''' Despite a tariff increase granted to NWC in 2004, the utility continued to register an operating loss for the fourth consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;OUR Annual Report 2005-2006, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; There thus is no cost recovery for capital costs. Poor enforcement of tariff payments contributes to the utility's low revenues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&amp;eid=000094946_02092104004520 World Bank]&lt;/ref&gt; Whenever tariffs are adjusted, the NWC and the OUR shall implement a public awareness campaign on how to reduce bills through water conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Water "Jamaica Water Sector" 28 January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Affordability''' The average Jamaican household spends 2.1% of its income on water services. This is approximately half of what the average household spend on electricity, and a bit less than half of what the average household spends on telephone services. The poorest 20% of household in Jamaica spend 3.2% of their income on water, while the richest 20% send 1.8% of their income on water.&lt;ref name="JWSPP"/&gt;

=== Investment and Financing ===

Most financing is provided through government grants to NWC, which are in turn financed by external loans, internal debt or general tax revenue. The government intends to tap other sources of financing, such as property taxes (called millage) and private sector financing.

The Water Sector Policy Paper of 1999 estimated investment needs until 2015 at US$2.2 billion, including US$1.3 billion for the "non-agricultural sector", US$0.3 billion for the agricultural sector  and US$0.6 billion for sewerage systems.&lt;ref name="JWSPP"&gt;[http://www.wra.gov.jm/dynaweb.dti?dynasection=history&amp;dynapage=water_policy#1 Ministry of Water:Jamaica Water Sector Policy Paper 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

== External cooperation ==

The main external cooperation partners that provide support to the Jamaican government for water supply and sanitation are the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], the [[World Bank]], United States and Japan.

=== Inter-American Development Bank ===
* Kingston Metro Water Supply Rehabilitation
Approved on 23 June 2004, a US$40 million loan aims to improve water and sanitation as well as to modernize the management in Kingston, Jamaica. The project is being implemented by the Ministry of Finance and Planning, as well as by the National Water Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iadb.org/news/articledetail.cfm?language=English&amp;artid=310&amp;artType=PR IDB:Kingston Metro Water Supply Rehabilitation]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7798">'''Willi A. Kalender''' (born August 1, 1949) is a German Medical Physicist and Professor and Chairman of the Institute of Medical Physics of the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imp.uni-erlangen.de/|title=Institute of Medical Physics, Erlangen|website=www.imp.uni-erlangen.de|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a Fellow of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) and Honorary Fellow of the British Institute of Radiology (BIR) and of the [[Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine]] (IPEM).

==Education==

Willi Kalender started his studies in physics and mathematics at the University of Bonn, Germany. He completed his Master’s and Ph.D. degree in Medical Physics at the University of Wisconsin in 1974 and 1979, respectively. In 1988 he completed all postdoctoral lecturing qualifications (Habilitation) at the University of Tübingen, Germany. In order to get a better grasp of the subject, he took and successfully completed all courses in the pre-clinical medicine curriculum.

==Career==

From 1979 to 1995 Dr. Kalender worked in the research laboratories of Siemens Medical Systems in Erlangen, Germany; he was appointed head of the Medical Physics group in 1988.  In 1995 he was appointed full Professor and Chairman of the newly established Institute of Medical Physics at the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. In 1999 he became Distinguished Visiting Professor to the Department of Radiology at Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.

==Research and Development Achievements==

Willi Kalender has conducted research mainly in the area of diagnostic radiology imaging with a clear focus on special CT applications. The goals of and motivation for his projects were mostly derived from observations during patient exams in clinical radiology.
 
Outstanding results were the development of the world’s first product options for dual-energy CT [1] in 1983 and for metal artefact reduction (MAR) [2] in 1987.

The development and introduction of volumetric spiral computed tomography was a highlight of his work; the world’s first clinical spiral CT studies were presented at RSNA 1989 [3] and were highly welcomed. The combination of continuous data acquisition with slip-ring-based data transmission and continuous table translation led to considerable reduction of examination times, to an essential reduction of motion artefacts and image quality significantly improved by providing isotropic spatial resolution as a decisive feature.
 
The development of a number of new and advanced applications such as angio-CT [4] and heart phase-specific cardiac imaging [6] followed and became a big success.
 
Other highly important fields of W. Kalender’s research have been radiation protection and the development of intelligent and very efficient dose reduction approaches such as tube current modulation [7] and the optimization of the choice of x-ray spectra [8]. They allow reducing the patient dose by an order of magnitude in many cases without impairing image quality. An overview of all measures he introduced is given in [9].

Presently, Willi Kalender’s research focusses on the development of an efficient breast-CT system to improve the early detection of breast cancer [10]. The scanner and in particular the development of its high-resolution photon-counting detector design allow scanning the breast with a dose similar to that of digital mammography, but with much higher resolution and clarity than mammography due to superposition-free fully 3D-resolution of breast-CT [11]. The introduction into clinical practice is expected for 2018 and should become another success story.

In the course of his prolific career Willi Kalender has founded a number of university spinoff companies to transfer scientific results into products and small business. In recognition of his contributions to the field of medical imaging Willi Kalender has received a number of prestigious awards.

[[Image:FieldWindbreaks.JPG|right|thumb|Aerial view of field windbreaks in [[North Dakota]]]]
[[Image:Svappavaara 1965a.jpg|right|thumb|One of the original buildings at [[Svappavaara]], designed by [[Ralph Erskine (architect)|Ralph Erskine]], which forms a long windbreak]]

A '''windbreak''' (shelterbelt) is a [[planting]] usually made up of one or more rows of [[tree]]s or [[shrub]]s planted in such a manner as to provide shelter from the [[wind]] and to protect soil from [[erosion]]. They are commonly planted in [[hedge]]rows around the edges of fields on [[farm]]s. If designed properly, windbreaks around a home can reduce the cost of heating and cooling and save [[energy]]. Windbreaks are also planted to help keep [[snow]] from drifting onto roadways or yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windbreaks|url=https://www.fs.usda.gov/nac/practices/windbreaks.shtml|website=National Agroforestry Center|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers sometimes use windbreaks to keep snow drifts on farm land that will provide water when the snow melts in the spring. Other benefits include contributing to a [[microclimate]] around [[crop]]s (with slightly less [[drying]] and chilling at night), providing [[habitat]] for wildlife&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blue-berry.pl/index.php/blog/role-of-trees-in-agriculture|title=Role of trees in agriculture|last=User|first=Super|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and, in some regions, providing [[wood]] if the trees are harvested.

Windbreaks and [[intercropping]] can be combined in a farming practice referred to as [[alleycropping]]. Fields are planted in rows of different crops surrounded by rows of trees. These trees provide fruit, wood, or protect the crops from the wind. Alley cropping has been particularly successful in India, Africa, and Brazil, where coffee growers have combined farming and forestry.&lt;ref&gt;Withgott &amp; Brennan 2008, p.249&lt;/ref&gt;

A further use for a shelterbelt is to screen a farm from a main road or motorway. This improves the farm landscape by reducing the visual incursion of the motorway, [[Noise mitigation|mitigating noise]] from the traffic and providing a safe barrier between farm animals and the road.

The term "windbreak" is also used to describe an article of clothing worn to prevent wind chill; this term is favored by Europeans whereas Americans tend to use the term "[[windbreaker]]".

Fences called "windbreaks" are also used. Normally made from [[cotton]], [[nylon]], [[canvas]], and recycled sails, windbreaks tend to have three or more panels held in place with poles that slide into pockets sewn into the panel.  The poles are then hammered into the ground and a windbreak is formed. Windbreaks or "wind fences" are used to reduce wind speeds over erodible areas such as open fields, industrial stockpiles, and dusty industrial operations. As erosion is proportional to wind speed cubed, a reduction of wind speed of 1/2 (for example) will reduce erosion by over 80%.

== Windbreak aerodynamics ==

[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-15117-0005, Infografik, Windschutz, Ertragssteigerung.jpg|thumb|An [[East Germany|East German]] windbreak promotion poster, 1952]]

In essence, when the wind encounters a porous obstacle such as a windbreak or shelterbelt, air pressure increases (loosely speaking, air ''piles up'') on the windward side and (conversely) air pressure decreases on the leeward side. As a result, the airstream approaching the barrier is retarded, and a proportion of it is displaced up and over the barrier, resulting in a ''jet'' of higher wind speed aloft. The remainder of the impinging airstream, having been retarded in its approach, now circulates through the barrier to its downstream edge, pushed along by the decrease in pressure across the shelterbelt's width; emerging on the downwind side, that airstream is now further retarded by an adverse pressure gradient, because in the lee of the barrier, with increasing downwind distance air pressure ''recovers'' again to the ambient level. The result is that minimum wind speed occurs not at or within the windbreak, nor at its downwind edge, but further downwind - nominally, at a distance of about 3 to 5 times the windbreak height ''H''. Beyond that point wind speed recovers, aided by downward momentum transport from the overlying, faster-moving stream. From the perspective of the [[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations]] these effects can be understood as resulting from the loss of momentum caused by the drag of leaves and branches and would be represented by the body force ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (a distributed momentum sink).&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1985; Journal of Wind Engineering &amp; Industrial Aerodynamics, Vol. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only is the mean (average) wind speed reduced in the lee of the shelter, the wind is also less gusty, for turbulent wind fluctuations are also damped. As a result, turbulent vertical mixing is weaker in the lee of the barrier than it is upwind, and interesting secondary microclimatic effects result. For instance, by day sensible heat rising from the ground due to the absorption of sunlight (see ''surface energy budget'') is mixed upward less efficiently in the lee of a windbreak, with the result that air temperature near ground is somewhat higher in the lee than on the windward side. Of course this effect is attenuated with increasing downwind distance and indeed, beyond about 8''H'' downstream a zone may exist that is actually ''cooler'' than upwind.&lt;ref&gt;Argete &amp; Wilson, 1989, Agricultural &amp; Forest Meteorology, Vol 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Yehuda Hiss was born in [[Poland]] shortly after the end of [[World War II]]. His family [[aliyah|immigrated]] to Israel when he was ten years old. He studied medicine in Israel, [[Italy]], [[Austria]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Myre&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/24/world/israeli-pathologist-faces-grisly-task-after-the-bombings.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/V/Violence&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Israeli Pathologist Faces Grisly Task After the Bombings|author=Greg Myre|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=February 24, 2004|accessdate=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical career==
Hiss became the director and chief pathologist at Abu Kabir in 1988. As director of the Institute, Hiss was involved with high-profile cases. Hiss performed the autopsy on [[Yitzhak Rabin]] after his 1995 assassination; his report was challenged in March 1999 by a group of Israeli academics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel National News]], 26 September 2005, [http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/90518 Infamous Chief Pathologist to Once Again Evade Punishment]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2003, he confirmed the identification of the body that washed ashore the beaches of Tel Aviv to be that of Omar Sharif, the accomplice of Asif Hanif, who carried out the [[Mike's Place suicide bombing]] the month previous.&lt;ref name=Guardian1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/20/israel|title=Mystery of the last hours of failed suicide bomber found dead in sea|author1=Chris McGreal|author2=Jeevan Vasagar|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=May 20, 2003 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hiss told [[Haaretz]] that Sharif's DNA was matched to samples provided by two British detectives and the cause of death was determined to be drowning.&lt;ref name=Haaretz1&gt;{{cite web|title=British bomber's body identified|author=Haaretz Staff|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=294817&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|date=May 19, 2003|accessdate=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also performed the autopsy on [[Rachel Corrie]].

A piece featuring Hiss that appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in February 2004 noted Hiss played a "unique role" in the response network that Israel had to developed to deal with the more than 100 suicide bombings it had experienced over the three years previous. All the dead from such attacks are brought to the Forensic Institute, and Hiss had been present to attend to, "the dismembered victims and shattered victims," in all but one attack.&lt;ref name=Myre/&gt; The same article mentions the controversy surrounding Hiss as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;"While the forensic center is praised for its work after bombings, Dr. Hiss has been involved in controversies related to other cases, including allegations that the institute removed organs from corpses without permission from the families. The issue is enormously sensitive because of [[Judaism]]'s emphasis on burying the whole body. Government inquiries have not resulted in any charges against Dr. Hiss. But in December the Israeli attorney general recommended disciplinary action. The issue is still under consideration, and no sanctions have been imposed so far."&lt;ref name=Myre/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 2006, following the carrying out of an autopsy that was ordered by the Israeli courts for a Haredi woman found murdered in her apartment, a riot by dozens of [[Haredim]] took place inside the institute where Hiss worked. According to Dr. Benny Davidson, the manager of the institute, "Even in the institute's darkest days, there wasn't an event this big. They wrecked the entire hall, broke expensive equipment, and destroyed (institute director) Yehuda Hiss' room. The public reaction to the articles on the pathological institute was an abandonment of Hiss."&lt;ref name=Ynet1&gt;{{cite web|title=Haredim ransack Forensics Institute|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3208824,00.html|author=Ynet reporters|date=January 31, 2006|accessdate=2009-10-01|publisher=[[YNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy==
According to Rebecca Dube in the ''[[The Forward|Forward]]'', allegations that Hiss and his lab were taking organs from corpses without permission and using them for research or selling them to medical schools were substantiated by the Israeli government.&lt;ref name=Dube/&gt; In 1998, after Alistair Sinclair, a Scottish tourist apprehended on suspicion of dealing drugs, died in a holding cell at [[Ben Gurion International Airport]], apparently having hanged himself.&lt;ref name=Dube/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenblum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishmediaresources.com/178/presumed-guilty|title=Rosenblum's Columns: Presumed guilty|author=[[Jonathan Rosenblum]]|publisher=Jewish Media Resources (Original in [[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=October 17, 2000|accessdate=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an autopsy overseen by Hiss, the body was returned to his family; a second autopsy performed by pathologists at the [[University of Glasgow]] found that the heart and a small bone at the base of his tongue were missing.&lt;ref name=Dube/&gt; [[Jonathan Rosenblum]] reported that the missing bone from his neck was considered necessary to confirming that he had hanged himself as stated, and that the Sinclair family believed his heart had been used for transplant.&lt;ref name=Rosenblum/&gt; The scandal was publicized by media in Israel and Scotland after the family sued.&lt;ref name=Dube/&gt;

Rosenblum, writing in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' in October 2000 cited a 12-page investigative report in November 1999 by the local [[Tel Aviv]] newspaper ''[[Ha'ir]]'' claiming that medical students at Abu Kabir under Hiss' direction were allowed to practice on bodies sent there for autopsy, and body parts were transferred for transplant  without permission from the families.&lt;ref name=Rosenblum/&gt; In January 2001, ''[[Yediot Aharonot]]'' claimed the institute headed by Hiss had been involved in "organ sales" of body parts to universities and medical schools for research and training, citing evidence including the "price listings" for body parts.&lt;ref name=Judy&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.322.7279.128/d|author=Judy Siegel-Itzkovich|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abridged/322/7279/128/d|journal=BMJ|date=January 20, 2001|volume=322|issue=128|version=Abridged|title=News roundup: "Sale of organs" to be investigated|doi-broken-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel's [[Israeli Health Ministry|Ministry of Health]] convened a committee to investigate the claims which found that Hiss had been involved for years in the sale of illegally removed body parts to medical schools.&lt;ref name=Dube/&gt;&lt;ref name=Judy/&gt; Hiss was never charged with any crime, but was forced to step down from running the state morgue in 2004. According to Rebecca Dube, "the final straw, apparently, was when the body of a youth killed in a road accident was gnawed upon by a rat in Hiss's lab."&lt;ref name=Dube/&gt; Every body that ended up in Hiss' morgue, whether Israeli or Palestinian, was fair game for organ harvesting.&lt;ref name=Dube&gt;{{Cite web|title=Illicit Body-Part Sales Present Widespread Problem|author=Rebecca Dube|publisher=[[The Forward|Forward]]|date=August 26, 2009|publication-date=September 4, 2009|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/112915/|accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiss ceased being the director of the institute in 2005 when allegations of a trade in organs resurfaced.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt; After Hiss admitted to having removed parts from 125 bodies without authorization, and following a [[plea bargain]] with the State of Israel, Israel's attorney-general, decided not to press criminal charges.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt; Hiss was given only a reprimand and continued to hold his position as chief pathologist at Abu Kabir and eventually regained his position as director.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/963/op2.htm|title=But did it happen?|author=[[Jonathan Cook]]|publisher=[[Al-Ahram]]|date=September 3–9, 2009|issue= 963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="health.gov.il"&gt;http://www.health.gov.il/english/forensic.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
