{{Criminal law}}
'''Causation''' is the "causal relationship between conduct and result". In other words, causation provides a means of connecting conduct with a resulting effect, typically an injury. In criminal law, it is defined as the ''[[actus reus]]'' (an action) from which the specific injury or other effect arose and is combined with ''[[mens rea]]'' (a state of mind) to comprise the elements of guilt. Causation only applies where a result has been achieved and therefore is immaterial with regard to [[inchoate offense]]s.

==Background concepts==
Legal systems more or less try to uphold the notions of [[Equity (law)|fairness]] and [[justice]]. If a [[State (polity)|state]] is going to penalize a person or require that person pay compensation to another for losses incurred, liability is imposed according to the idea that those who injure others should take responsibility for their actions. Although some parts of any legal system will have qualities of [[strict liability]], in which the ''[[mens rea]]'' is immaterial to the result and subsequent liability of the actor, most look to establish liability by showing that the defendant was the cause of the particular injury or loss.

Even the youngest children quickly learn that, with varying degrees of probability, consequences flow from physical acts and omissions. The more predictable the outcome, the greater the likelihood that the actor caused the injury or loss intentionally. There are many ways in which the law might capture this simple rule of practical experience: that there is a natural flow to events, that a reasonable man in the same situation would have foreseen this consequence as likely to occur, that the loss flowed naturally from the breach of contractual duties or tortuous actions, etc. However it is phrased, the essence of the degree of fault attributed will lie in the fact that reasonable people try to avoid injuring others, so if harm was foreseeable, there should be liability to the extent that the extent of the harm actually resulting was foreseeable.

===Relationship between causation and liability===
Causation of an event alone is insufficient to create legal liability.

Sometimes causation is one part of a multi-stage test for legal liability. For example, for the defendant to be held liable for the tort of negligence, the defendant must have owed the plaintiff a [[duty of care]], breached that duty, by so doing caused [[Property damage|damage]] to the plaintiff, and that damage must not have been too remote. Causation is just one component of the tort.

On other occasions, causation is the only requirement for legal liability (other than the fact that the outcome is proscribed). For example, in the law of [[product liability]], the courts have come to apply to principle of ''strict liability'' : the fact that the defendant's product caused the plaintiff harm is the only thing that matters. The defendant need not also have been negligent.

On still other occasions, causation is irrelevant to legal liability altogether. For example, under a contract of [[Indemnity|indemnity insurance]], the [[Insurance|insurer]] agrees to indemnify the [[Victimology|victim]] for harm not caused by the insurer, but by other parties.

Because of the difficulty in establishing causation, it is one area of the law where the case law overlaps significantly with general doctrines of analytic philosophy to do with causation. The two subjects have long been intermingled.

== Establishing causation ==
Where establishing causation is required to establish legal liability, it usually involves a two-stage inquiry, firstly establishing 'factual' causation, then 'legal' causation.

‘Factual’ causation must be established before inquiring into legal causation, perhaps by assessing if the defendant acted in the plaintiff’s loss.

Determining ‘legal’ causation often involves a question of public policy regarding the sort of situation in which, despite the outcome of the factual enquiry,  the defendant might nevertheless be released from liability, or impose liability.

==Establishing factual causation==
The usual method of establishing factual causation is the ''but-for test''. The but for test inquires ‘But for the defendant’s act, would the harm have occurred?’ A shoots and wounds B. We ask ‘But for A's act, would B have been wounded?’ The answer is ‘No.’ So we conclude that A caused the harm to B. The but for test is a test of necessity. It asks was it ‘necessary’ for the defendant’s act to have occurred for the harm to have occurred. In New South Wales, this requirement exists in s 5D of the ''Civil Liability Act 2002'' (NSW),&lt;ref name="CLA 5D"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|cla2002161|Civil Liability Act 2002|5D}} General principles.&lt;/ref&gt; reinforcing established common law principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|48|2009|litigants=Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak; Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Bou Najem |parallelcite= |date=10 November 2009 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One weakness in the but-for test arises in situations where each of several acts alone are sufficient to cause the harm. For example, if both A and B fire what would alone be fatal shots at C at approximately the same time, and C dies, it becomes impossible to say that but-for A's shot, or but-for B's shot alone, C would have died. Taking the but-for test literally in such a case would seem to make neither A nor B responsible for C's death.

The courts have generally accepted the but for test notwithstanding these weaknesses, qualifying it by saying that causation is to be understood “as the man in the street” would,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yorkshire Dale Steamship Co v Minister of War Transport]]'' {{Oscola|PROP|1942||AC|691|[[House of Lords|HL]]|}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, or by supplementing it with “common sense”.&lt;ref name="March v Stramare"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1993|litigants=[[March v Stramare (E &amp; MH) Pty Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1991) 171 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 506 |courtname=auto |date=24 April 1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This dilemma was handled in the [[United States]] in ''[[State v. Tally]]'', {{West|S|15||722|Ala.|1894|738}}, where the court ruled that: “The assistance given ... need not contribute to criminal result in the sense that but for it the result would not have ensued. It is quite sufficient if it facilitated a result that would have transpired without it.” Using this logic, A and B are liable in that no matter who was responsible for the fatal shot, the other "facilitated" the criminal act even though his shot was not necessary to deliver the fatal blow.

However, legal scholars have attempted to make further inroads into what explains these difficult cases. Some scholars have proposed a test of sufficiency instead of a test of necessity. [[H. L. A. Hart]] and [[Tony Honoré]], and later [[Richard W. Wright (Professor, Chicago-Kent College of Law)|Richard Wright]], have said that something is a cause if it is a ‘necessary element of a set of conditions jointly sufficient for the result’. This is known as the [[NESS test]]. In the case of the [[Summers v. Tice|two hunters]], the set of conditions required to bring about the result of the victim's injury would include a gunshot to the eye, the victim being in the right place at the right time, gravity, etc. In such a set, either of the hunters' shots would be a member, and hence a cause. This arguably gives us a more theoretically satisfying reason to conclude that something was a cause of something else than by appealing to notions of intuition or common sense.

Hart and Honore, in their famous work ''Causation in the Law'', also tackle the problem of 'too many causes'. For them, there are degrees of causal contribution.  A member of the NESS set is a "causally relevant condition". This is elevated into a "cause" where it is a deliberate human intervention, or an abnormal act in the context. So, returning to our [[Hunting|hunter]] example, hunter A's grandmother's birth is a causally relevant condition, but not a "cause". On the other hand, hunter A's gunshot, being a deliberate human intervention in the ordinary state of affairs, is elevated to the status of "cause". An intermediate position can be occupied by those who "occasion" harm, such as accomplices. Imagine an accomplice to a murder who drives the principal to the scene of the crime. Clearly the principal's act in committing the murder is a "cause" (on the but for or NESS test). So is the accomplice's act in driving the principal to the scene of the crime. However, the causal contribution is not of the same level (and, incidentally, this provides some basis for treating principals and accomplices differently under criminal law). Leon Green and Jane Stapleton are two scholars who take the opposite view. They consider that once something is a "but for" (Green) or NESS (Stapleton) condition, that ends the factual inquiry altogether, and anything further is a question of policy.

==Establishing legal causation==
Notwithstanding the fact that causation may be established in the above situations, the law often intervenes and says that it will nevertheless not hold the defendant liable because in the circumstances the defendant is not to be understood, in a legal sense, as having caused the loss. In the United States, this is known as the doctrine of [[proximate cause]]. The most important doctrine is that of ''novus actus interveniens'', which means a ‘new intervening act’ which may ‘cut the chain of causation’.

===Proximate cause===
{{Main|Proximate cause}}
The but-for test is factual causation and often gives us the right answer to causal problems, but sometimes not. Two difficulties are immediately obvious. The first is that under the but-for test, almost anything is a cause. But for a tortfeasor's grandmother's birth, the relevant tortious conduct would not have occurred. But for the victim of a crime missing the [[bus]], he or she would not have been at the site of the crime and hence the crime would not have occurred.  Yet in these two cases, the grandmother's birth or the victim's missing the bus are not intuitively causes of the resulting harm. This often does not matter in the case where cause is only one element of liability, as the remote actor will most likely not have committed the other elements of the test. The legally liable cause is the one closest to or most proximate to the injury. This is known as the Proximate Cause rule. However, this situation can arise in strict liability situations.

===Intervening cause===
Imagine the following. A critically injures B. As B is wheeled to an ambulance, she is struck by lightning. She would not have been struck if she had not been injured in the first place. Clearly then, A caused B's whole injury on the ‘but for’ or NESS test.&lt;ref name="CLA 5D"/&gt;&lt;ref name="March v Stramare"/&gt; However, at law, the intervention of a supervening event renders the defendant not liable for the injury caused by the lightning.

The effect of the principle may be stated simply:
:if the new event, whether through human agency or natural causes, does not break the chain, the original actor is liable for all the consequences flowing naturally from the initial circumstances. But if the new act breaks the chain, the liability of the initial actor stops at that point, and the new actor, if human, will be liable for all that flows from his or her contribution.

Note, however, that this does not apply if the [[Eggshell skull]] rule is used.&lt;ref&gt;''Nader v Urban Transit Authority of NSW'' (1985) 2 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 501.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kavanagh v Akhtar"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|779|1998|litigants=Kavanagh v Akhtar |parallelcite=(1998) 45 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 588 |courtname=auto |date=23 December 1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For details, see article on the Eggshell Skull doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/camplr24&amp;div=6&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals# J. Stanley McQuade, The Eggshell Skull Rule and Related Problems in Recovery for Mental Harm in the Law of Torts, 24 Campbell L. Rev. 1, 46 (2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;
actus interveniens

===Independent sufficient causes===
When two or more negligent parties, where the consequence of their negligence joins together to cause damages, in a circumstance where either one of them alone would have caused it anyway, each is deemed to be an "Independent Sufficient Cause," because each could be deemed a "substantial factor,"  and both are held legally responsible for the damages. For example, where negligent firestarter A's fire joins with negligent firestarter B's fire to burn down House C, both A and B are held responsible. (e.g., ''Anderson v. Minneapolis, St: P. &amp; S. St. R.R. Co''., 146 Minn. 430, 179 N.W. 45 (1920).)  This is an element of Legal Cause.

===''Summers v. Tice'' Rule===

The other problem is that of overdetermination.  Imagine two hunters, A and B, who each negligently fire a shot that takes out C's eye.  Each shot on its own would have been sufficient to cause the damage.  But for A's shot, would C's eye have been taken out?  Yes.  The same answer follows in relation to B's shot.  But on the but-for test, this leads us to the counterintuitive position that neither shot caused the injury. However, courts have held that in order to prevent each of the defendants avoiding liability for lack of actual cause, it is necessary to hold both of them responsible, See ''[[Summers v. Tice]]'', 33 Cal.2d 80, 199 P.2d 1 (1948).  This is known, simply, as the ''Summers v. Tice'' Rule.

===Concurrent actual causes===
Suppose that two actors' negligent acts combine to produce one set of damages, where but for either of their negligent acts, no damage would have occurred at all.  This is two negligences contributing to a single cause, as distinguished from two separate negligences contributing to two successive or separate causes.  These are "concurrent actual causes".  In such cases, courts have held both defendants liable for their negligent acts. Example:  A leaves truck parked in the middle of the road at night with its lights off.  B fails to notice it in time and plows into it, where it could have been avoided, except for want of negligence, causing damage to both vehicles.  Both parties were negligent. (''Hill v. Edmonds'', 26 A.D.2d 554, 270 N.Y.S.2d 1020 (1966).)

===Foreseeability===

Legal Causation is usually expressed as a question of 'foreseeability'.  An actor is liable for the foreseeable, but not the unforeseeable, consequences of his or her act.  For example, it is foreseeable that if I shoot someone on a beach and they are immobilized, they may drown in a rising tide rather than from the trauma of the gunshot wound or from loss of blood.  However it is not (generally speaking) foreseeable that they will be struck by lightning and killed by that event.

This type of causal foreseeability is to be distinguished from foreseeability of extent or kind of injury, which is a question of remoteness of damage, not causation.  For example, if I conduct welding work on a dock that lights an oil slick that destroys a ship a long way down the river, it would be hard to construe my negligence as anything other than causal of the ship's damage.  There is no ''novus actus interveniens''.  However, I may not be held liable if that damage is not of a type foreseeable as arising from my negligence.&lt;ref name= "PC"&gt;{{cite bailii|litigants=[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd]] (Wagon Mound No. 1) |year=1961 |court=UKPC |num=2 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1961] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 388; [1961] 1 [[All England Law Reports |All ER]] 404 |courtname=auto |juris=NSW |date=18 January 1961}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  That is a question of public policy, and not one of causation.{{or|date=September 2011}}

==Example==
An example of how foreseeability does not apply to the extent of an injury is the [[eggshell skull rule]].  If Neal punched Matt in the jaw, it is foreseeable that Matt will suffer a bodily injury that he will need to go to the hospital for.  However, if his jaw is very weak, and his jaw comes completely off from my punch, then the doctor bills, which would have been about $5,000 for wiring his jaw shut had now become $100,000 for a full-blown jaw re-attachment.  Neal would still be liable for the entire $100,000, even though $95,000 of those damages were not reasonably foreseeable.

== Other relevant considerations ==
Because causation in the law is a complex amalgam of fact and policy, other doctrines are also important, such as foreseeability and risk.  Particularly in the United States, where the doctrine of 'proximate cause' effectively amalgamates the two-stage factual then legal causation inquiry favoured in the English system, one must always be alert to these considerations in assessing the postulated relationship between two events.

===Foreseeability tests===
Some aspects of the physical world are so inevitable that it is always reasonable to [[imputation (law)|impute]] knowledge of their incidence. So if A abandons B on a beach, A must be taken to foresee that the tide comes in and goes out. But the mere fact that B subsequently drowns is not enough. A court would have to consider where the body was left and what level of injury A believed that B had suffered. If B was left in a position that any [[reasonable person]] would consider safe but a [[storm surge]] caused extensive flooding throughout the area, this might be a ''novus actus''. That B was further injured by an event within a foreseen class does not of itself require a court to hold that every incident falling within that class is a natural link in the chain. Only those causes that are reasonably foreseeable fit naturally into the chain. So if A had heard a weather forecast predicting a storm, the drowning will be a natural outcome. But if this was an event like a [[flash flood]], an entirely unpredictable event, it will be a ''novus actus''.

The question of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B is only slightly injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is it to say that he ''ought'' to have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.

Similarly, in the quantification of damages generally and/or the partitioning of damages between two or more defendants, the extent of the liability to compensate the plaintiff(s) will be determined by what was reasonably foreseeable. So if, for example, the plaintiff unexpectedly contributed to the extent of the loss suffered, that additional element would not be included in the damages award even though the plaintiff would not have had the opportunity to make this mistake had it not been for the defendant's breach. In cases involving the partitioning of damages between multiple defendants, each will be liable to the extent that their contribution foreseeably produced the loss.

===Risk===
Sometimes the reverse situation to a ''novus actus'' occurs, i.e. factual causation cannot be proved but the court nevertheless does want to hold the defendant liable.  In ''Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories'', {{West|P|607|2|924|Cal.|1980|}} the plaintiff's mother consumed [[diethylstilbestrol]] as a miscarriage preventative.&lt;ref name="Sindell5945"&gt;''Sindell'', at 594-95.{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medicine, later re-called from the market, caused the defendant to develop a malignant bladder tumor due to its negligent manufacture.&lt;ref name="Sindell5945"/&gt; However, there were many manufacturers of that drug in the market.  The manufacturer of the particular medication that caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain.&lt;ref&gt;''Sindell'', at 596.{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court held that the defendant was liable in proportion to its market share.&lt;ref name="Sindell6112"&gt;''Sindell'', at 611-12.{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They departed from traditional notions of pure cause and adopted a ‘risk based’ approach to liability.  The defendant was held liable because of the amount of risk it contributed to the occasioning of the harm.&lt;ref name="Sindell6112"/&gt;  Note that a risk theory is not strictly a theory built on notions of cause at all, as, by definition, the person who caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain.  However, it does show that legal notions of causation are a complex mixture of factual causes and ideas of public policy relating to the availability of legal remedies. In ''R v Miller'' {{Oscola|NEUT|1982|||6|UKHL|}}, the House of Lords said that a person who puts a person in a dangerous position, in that case a fire, will be criminally liable if he does not adequately rectify the situation.

===Evidence proving causation===
To be acceptable, any rule of law must be capable of being applied consistently, thus a definition of the criteria for this qualitative analysis must be supplied. Let us assume a purely factual analysis as a starting point. A injures B and leaves him lying in the road. C is a driver who fails to see B on the road and by running over him, contributes to the cause of his death. It would be possible to ask for a detailed medical evaluation at a [[Autopsy|post mortem]] to determine the initial degree of injury and the extent to which B's life was threatened, followed by a second set of injuries from the collision and their contribution. If the first incident merely damaged B's leg so that he could not move, it is tempting to assert that C's driving must have been the more substantial cause and so represents a ''novus actus'' breaking the chain. Equally, if B was bleeding to death and the only contribution that the driving made was to break B's arm, the driving is not a ''novus actus'' and does not break the chain. But this approach ignores the issue of A's foresight.

Roads are, by their nature, used by vehicles and it is clearly foreseeable that a person left lying on the road is at risk of being further injured by an inattentive driver. Hence, if A leaves B on the road with knowledge of that risk and a foreseeable event occurs, A remains the more [[proximate cause]]. This leaves whether the test of foresight should be subjective, objective or hybrid (i.e. both subjective and objective). Obviously, there is no difficulty in holding A liable if A had actual knowledge of the likelihood that B would be further injured by a driver. The fault which caused the initial injury is compounded by the omission to move B to a safer place or call for assistance. But let us assume that A never averts the possibility of further injury. The issue is now the extent to which knowledge may be [[imputation (law)|imputed]] objectively.

== The future? ==
A difficult issue that has arisen recently is the case where the defendant neither factually causes the harm, nor increases the risk of its occurrence.  In ''[[Chester v Afshar]]'' {{Oscola|PROP|2004|4|All ER|587|[[House of Lords|HL]]|}}, a doctor negligently failed to warn a patient of risks inherent in an operation, specifically [[cauda equina syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Chester5"&gt;''Chester'' [5].{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The patient had the operation and a risk materialized causing injury.&lt;ref name="Chester5"/&gt;  It was found that even if the patient had been warned, the patient would still have undergone the operation, simply at a different time.&lt;ref&gt;''Chester'' [7].{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The risk of the injury would be the same at both times.  Accordingly, the doctor neither caused the injury (because but for the failure to warn, the patient would still have gone ahead with the operation), nor increased the risk of its occurrence (because the risk was the same either way).  Yet the House of Lords, embracing a more normative approach to causation, still held the doctor liable.  Lawyers and philosophers continue to debate whether and how this changes the state of the law.

==English criminal case law examples==

===''[[Breaking the chain|Novus actus interveniens]]''===
*'''Victim's contribution''' ''R v Dear'' (1996) CLR 595. Believing that the victim had sexually interfered with his 12-year-old daughter, the defendant attacked the victim with a Stanley knife. The defendant argued that the chain of causation had been broken because, two days later, the victim had committed suicide either by reopening his wounds or because he had failed to take steps to staunch the blood flow after the wounds had reopened spontaneously (i.e. the potential suicide constituted a ''novus actus interveniens''). It was held that the real question was whether the injuries inflicted by the defendant were an operating and significant cause of or contribution to the death. Distinctions between the victim's mere self-neglect (no break in the chain) and the victim's gross self-neglect (break in the chain) were not helpful. The victim's death resulted from bleeding from the artery severed by the defendant. Whether the resumption or continuation of that bleeding was deliberately caused by the victim, the defendant's conduct remained the operative and significant cause of the victim's death.
*'''Third party's inadvertent contribution''' ''[[R v Smith]]'' (1959) 2 QB 35 the defendant stabbed his victim twice in a barrack room brawl. Another soldier carried him to the medical centre but dropped him twice. The medical captain was very busy and failed to recognise the extent of the injuries. If the soldier had received proper treatment, he would have had a good chance of a complete recovery. Smith was convicted of [[manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]] because the wound was the "operating and substantial cause of death".  In ''R v Cheshire'' (1991) 3 AER 670, the victim was shot in the leg and stomach. In hospital, he suffered pneumonia and respiratory problems in intensive care so had a tracheotomy. After two months, he died. There was some medical negligence because the tracheotomy had caused a thickening of tissue ultimately causing suffocation. In upholding the conviction for [[murder in English law|murder]], [[Roy Beldam|Beldam LJ]] laid down the following test:
:Even though negligence in the treatment of the victim was the immediate cause of his death, the jury should not regard it as excluding the responsibility of the accused unless the negligent treatment was so independent of his acts, and in itself so potent in causing death, that they regard the contribution made by his acts as insignificant.
*'''Third party's deliberate intervention''' ''R v Malcherek'' (1981) 73 Cr. App. R. 173. The victim was placed on a life support machine and, after determining that she was brain dead, the doctors turned off the machine. The defendant appealed the conviction of murder arguing that the doctors had broken the chain of causation  by deliberately switching off the life support machine. It was held that the original wounds were the operating and substantial cause of death, and that a life support machine does no more than hold the effect of the injuries in suspension and when the machine is switched off, the original wounds continue to cause the death no matter how long the victim survives after the machine's disconnection. In ''R v Pagett'' (1983) 76 Cr. App. R. 279, to resist lawful arrest, the defendant held a girl in front of him as a shield and shot at armed policemen. The police instinctively fired back and killed the girl. The Court of Appeal held that the defendant's act caused the death and that the reasonable actions of a third party acting in [[self-defence in English law|self-defence]] could not be regarded as a ''novus actus interveniens'' because self-defence is a foreseeable consequence of his action and had not broken the chain of causation.

===Foreseeability===
*'''Victim's conscious actions''' ''[[R v. Blaue]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R v Blaue |year=1975 |court=EWCA |division=Crim |num=3 |date=16 July 1975 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a criminal law application of the "[[thin skull rule]]" in [[criminal law]]. The defendant visited the home of a Jehovah's Witness and demanded sex. When she refused, he stabbed her four times. At hospital, she refused a blood transfusion which would have saved her life. There was no suggestion that the doctors had acted improperly. Blaue was convicted of manslaughter by an unlawful act, namely [[grievous bodily harm|wounding with intent]]. "But for" his actions, she would not have been faced with the choice about treatment and those who use violence on others must take their victims as they find them (albeit that he had known her religion and so her refusal was foreseeable).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5741">The '''cheerleader effect''', also known as the '''group attractiveness effect''', is the [[cognitive bias]] which causes people to think individuals are more attractive when they are in a group. The term was backed up by research by Drew Walker &amp; Edward Vul (2013) and van Osch et al. (2015).&lt;ref name="Walker2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vanOsch2015"/&gt;

== Media ==
The phrase was coined by the character [[Barney Stinson]] in "[[Not a Father's Day]]", an episode of the television series ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', first aired in 2008. Barney points out to his friends a group of women that initially seem attractive, but who all seem to be very ugly when examined individually. This point is made again by [[Ted Mosby|Ted]] and [[Robin Scherbatsky|Robin]] later in the episode, who note that some of Barney's friends also only seem attractive in a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/11/cheerleader-effect-why-people-are-more-beautiful-in-groups/281119/|title=Cheerleader Effect: Why People Are More Beautiful in Groups|work=[[The Atlantic]]|last=Hamblin|first=James|date=November 4, 2013|accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Studies ==
===2013 study===
Across five studies by Walker and Vul (2013), participants rated the attractiveness of male and female faces when shown in a group photo, and an individual photo, with the order of the photographs randomised. The people photographed got higher scores for their group photos.&lt;ref name="Walker2013"/&gt;

This effect occurs with male-only, female-only and mixed gender groups, and both small and large groups. The effect occurs to the same extent with groups of four and 16 people. Participants in studies looked more at the attractive people than the unattractive people in the group. The effect does not occur because group photos give the impression that individuals have more social or emotional intelligence: this was shown to be the case by a study which used individual photos grouped together in a single image, rather than photos taken of people in a group.

====Proposed explanation====
Drew Walker and Edward Vul proposed that this effect arises due to the interplay of three [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive phenomena]]:&lt;ref name="Walker2013"/&gt;
#The human [[visual system]] takes "ensemble representations" of faces in a group.
#Perception of individuals is biased towards this average.
#Average faces are more attractive, perhaps due to "averaging out of unattractive idiosyncracies".&lt;ref name=Langlois1990/&gt;
When all three of these phenomena are taken together, the individual faces will seem more attractive in a group, as they appear more similar to the average group face, which is more attractive than members' individual faces.&lt;ref name="Walker2013"/&gt;

===2015 study===
A 2015 study by van Osch et al. confirmed the results obtained by Walker and Vul.&lt;ref name="vanOsch2015"/&gt;

====Proposed explanation====
The research team offered two different explanations for the group attractiveness effect:&lt;ref name="vanOsch2015"/&gt;
#[[Selective attention]] to attractive group members.
#The [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] principle of similarity.
They claim that selective attention fits better the gathered data.&lt;ref name="vanOsch2015"/&gt;

===Controversy===
A 2015 replication of Walker and Vul's study failed to show any significant results for the group attractiveness effect. The research team hypothesized that this may be due to cultural differences, since the replication study was performed in Japan.&lt;ref name="Ojiro2015"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17478">[[File:CigarSockets.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Metal and plastic cigarette lighter receptacles]]
The '''cigarette lighter receptacle''' (also called a '''cigar lighter receptacle''' or '''cigar lighter socket''') in an [[automobile]] was initially designed to power an electrically heated [[lighter|cigarette lighter]], but became a [[de facto standard]] [[DC connector]] to supply electrical power for portable accessories used in or near an automobile. While the cigarette lighter receptacle is a common feature of automobiles and trucks, as a DC power connector it has the disadvantages of bulkiness, relatively low current rating{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}, and poor contact reliability.

Examples of devices that can be operated from a cigarette lighter receptacle include lights, fans, beverage heating devices, and small motorized tools such as [[air compressor]]s for inflating [[tire]]s. Many portable electronic devices such as [[Digital audio player|music players]] or [[mobile telephone]]s use a cigarette lighter receptacle to recharge their internal batteries or to directly operate from the vehicle electrical system. Adapters for electronic devices may change voltage to be compatible with the supplied device. Devices that require alternating-current [[mains electricity]] can be operated with a plug-in [[electrical inverter|inverter]].

Automobiles may provide several 12&amp;nbsp;V receptacles that are intended only to operate electrical accessories, and which cannot be used with a cigarette lighter. Car manufacturers may offer a cigarette lighter only as an optional extra-cost accessory. Usually, only one 12&amp;nbsp;V receptacle near the driver will be able to accommodate an actual cigarette lighter, with other receptacles designated as "12&amp;nbsp;V auxiliary power outlets" which are not physically able to power a lighter.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== History ==
The electrical cigar-lighter was invented and patented in the early 1880s by the German inventor {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich Wilhelm Schindler|de}}.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} In the 1890s, these tools were sold as electrical cigar lighters (''Cigarrenanzünder''), and later as ''Zigarrenanzünder'' in the major German warehouse catalogues.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Probably in the 1920s they were renamed "cigarette lighters", as cigarettes overtook cigars in sales.

In 1921, the Morris {{US patent|1,376,154}} was issued for a so-called "wireless" or "cordless" lighter with a removable element. The igniter was heated in the socket and then manually removed for use after an appropriate time interval.&lt;ref name="supreme.justia.com"/&gt;

In the United States, cigarette lighters started appearing as standard equipment in automobiles in 1925–1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/11/04/pf/autos/lighters/index.htm?cnn=yes|title=Cigarette lighters: The new cupholders?|publisher=CNN.com|accessdate=2007-06-05 | date=2003-11-04 | first=Peter | last=Valdes-Dapena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, the Connecticut Automotive Specialty Company (Casco) in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] [[patent]]ed its version of an automotive cigarette lighter, which used a cord and reel.&lt;ref name="Casco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cascoglobal.com/n20845/i22128.html |title=Casco Cigar lighter Facts &amp; Figures |publisher=Casco |accessdate=2007-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625154507/http://www.cascoglobal.com/n20845/i22128.html |archivedate=2007-06-25 |df= }}{{dubious|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the reel-type lighters, the igniter unit was connected with a source of current by a cable which was wound on a spring drum so that the igniter unit and cable could be withdrawn from the socket and be used for lighting a cigar or cigarette. As the removable plug was returned to the socket, the wires were reeled back into it. The circuit was closed either by pressing a button or removing the igniter from its socket.&lt;ref name="supreme.justia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/314/84/index.html|title=Cuno Engineering v. Automatic Devices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern "automatic" removable automotive V-Coil lighter was developed by Casco in 1956,&lt;ref name="Casco" /&gt; for which it received {{US patent|2,959,664}}, issued in 1960.

== Use as a lighter ==
[[Image:Car cigarette lighter.jpg|thumb|Car cigarette lighter, with brass-colored heating element visible at front]]
The lighter is a metal or plastic cylinder containing a thin flat coil of [[nichrome]] metal strip, through which high current (~10 [[ampere]]s) passes when the device is activated, usually by pushing it into the socket as though it were a [[push-button]]. When pushed in, the lighter is held against the force of a spring by a clip attached to a [[bi-metallic strip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|5,932,126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[heating element]] glows orange hot in seconds, causing the bi-metallic strip to bend and release the mechanism, and the handle pops out, eliminating the need for the user to time the heating operation. If the lighter is then promptly removed from its socket, it can light a  cigarette, cigar, or [[tinder]].

== Use as an electrical outlet ==
[[File:Car 12V DC plug.jpg|thumb|upright|A 12 volt cigarette lighter plug, with a tip that may be unscrewed to replace an internal [[Fuse (automotive)|fuse]]]]
In newer cars, the socket is equipped with a plastic cover without the lighter heating element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/28213/Latest-Gallup-Update-Shows-Cigarette-Smoking-Near-Historical-Lows.aspx|title=Latest Gallup Update Shows Cigarette Smoking Near Historical Lows|publisher=Gallup.com|accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the socket has been repurposed and continues to be used to power [[consumer electronics]] in vehicles.&lt;ref name="Laukkonen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laukkonen|first1=Jeremy|title=12V Socket or Cigarette Lighter Receptacle? The De Facto 12V DC Power Socket|url=http://cartech.about.com/od/Power/a/12v-Socket-Or-Cigarette-Lighter-Receptacle.htm|website=About.com|accessdate=2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, a vehicle may come with several outlets for convenience, some in the rear passenger area of the vehicle or even the cargo area, for such purposes as powering portable [[GPS]] devices, recharging mobile phones, or powering a [[air compressor|tire inflator]], a [[vacuum cleaner]] or a [[thermoelectric cooler]]. These outlets usually have a plastic cap tethered to them, and are usually labeled as being only for DC power, because they are not intended to withstand the heat produced by an electrical cigarette lighter.

The use of cigarette lighter receptacles to supply 12 volt DC power is a classic example of [[backward compatibility]] to a [[de facto standard]]. The connector falls far short of ideal, being physically large and awkward to use, while being less reliable than alternatives such as the [[Anderson Powerpole]] connector (which is often used by [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts in mobile operations). Nevertheless, cigarette lighter receptacles are in widespread use, and all but the lowest-cost cars, trucks, [[recreational vehicles|RVs]], and even boats can be expected to have at least one such receptacle. Portable cigarette lighter receptacles attached to cables and [[alligator clip]]s for connection directly to [[car battery|car batteries]] are available for temporary use. In newer vehicles, one or more [[USB connector]]s may also be provided, as a source of modest amounts of 5 volt DC power, but even in these situations a cigarette lighter receptacle is provided for 12 volt DC power, and for applications that require higher current.

Standardized 12 volt DC automobile plugs are defined in the United States by [[Underwriters Laboratories|UL]] Standard 2089 regarding vehicle [[Lead–acid battery|battery]] adapters. This standard covers plugs and cord sets that insert into cigarette lighter receptacles. In Europe, 12 volt plugs and sockets are not specially regulated, and do not require approvals for the [[CE mark]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The male plug is sometimes used to feed power ''into'' a vehicle to recharge its battery. For instance, portable solar battery maintainers generally connect to a vehicle's battery in this manner. [[Trickle charge]]rs also sometimes connect in this way, eliminating the need to leave a vehicle's hood open, as well as eliminating the possibility of reversed polarity. In some models, the cigarette lighter outlet is not powered when the ignition key is removed and charging is not possible.

=== Technical details ===
The sockets and mating plugs are defined in the ANSI/SAE J563&lt;ref name="SAE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard for 12 Volt Cigarette Lighters, Power Outlets, and Accessory Plugs|url=http://standards.sae.org/j563_200902/|website=SAE International|publisher=SAE International|accessdate=2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; specification. For the 12 volt systems, the "contact point", which is the center part of the plug when viewed end-on, carries the positive voltage, whereas the "can" part, which is the outer part of the connector, carries the negative voltage (which is the "ground" connection for most automobiles, which have a negative ground electrical system).

12 volt auto connectors are made to comply with a standard by [[Underwriters Laboratories]] for safety. UL2089 was developed to cover the requirements for portable adapters rated 24 V DC or less that are intended to be supplied from the battery powered electrical system of a vehicle. Products covered by the standard include cord assemblies of a plug that mates with the standard cigarette receptacle found in automobiles.

; 6-volt cigarette lighter receptacle and plug:
* Receptacle inside diameter: {{nowrap|21.34–21.46 mm}} (median {{nowrap|21.4 mm}})
* Plug body diameter: {{nowrap|21.08–21.23 mm}} (median {{nowrap|21.155 mm}})

; 12-volt cigarette lighter receptacle and plug, size A:
* Receptacle inside diameter: {{nowrap|20.93–21.01 mm}} (median {{nowrap|20.97 mm}})
* Plug body diameter: {{nowrap|20.73–20.88 mm}} (median {{nowrap|20.805 mm}})
* Most often used in American automobiles

; 12-volt cigarette lighter receptacle and plug, size B:
* Receptacle inside diameter: {{nowrap|21.41–21.51 mm}} (median {{nowrap|21.455 mm}})
* Plug body diameter: {{nowrap|21.13–21.33 mm}} (median {{nowrap|21.18 mm}})
* Most often used in European automobiles, and sometimes as a second socket in American automobiles expressly for DC power connections.

Plugs often include a [[pilot light]] [[LED]] indicator to indicate that electrical power is connected. Optionally, the plug may be equipped with an internal [[Fuse (automotive)|fuse]] for electrical safety, usually rated at 10 amps or less. In some designs, the tip of the plug may be unscrewed to reveal a cylindrical glass fuse; other variants may use a newer blade-type fuse inserted into the side or back of the plug.

=== Design considerations ===
Since the cigarette lighter socket was originally designed only to heat a cigarette lighter, repurposing these sockets as generic power connectors can lead to many problems. In addition to the issues with partially-compatible physical dimensions, the plugs can vibrate out of the socket under normal driving conditions, owing to poor retention. Also, there have been reports of melted plug tips due to poor contact and heat generation from [[electrical resistance|ohmic resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showthread.html?t=215769#td_post_2354183|title=Testing power from car cigarette lighter socket ?|publisher=moneysavingexpert.com|accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-vehicular use in stationary settings may avoid vibration problems when used as an alternative to 120 volt AC outlets, but low-quality connectors may still develop high resistance or intermittent contact.

A second problem is that nominally "twelve-volt" power in cars fluctuates widely. The actual voltage will be approximately 12.5 volts when dormant (less in cold conditions), approximately 14.5 volts when the engine and the alternator/generator are operating (more when cold), and may briefly drop as low as 5–6 volts during engine start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servicemanagement365.com/Mobile_Communications_Hardware/Article405913.aspx |title=Plugging the cigar lighter gap |publisher=Service Management 365 |accessdate=2007-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717205010/http://www.servicemanagement365.com/Mobile_Communications_Hardware/Article405913.aspx |archivedate=July 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When used, [[DC to DC converter]]s will usually compensate for small fluctuations, but reliable power may not be available without an independent battery-powered [[uninterruptible power supply]].

Rarely, more extreme cases of voltage fluctuation can occur when the car battery is disconnected while the engine is running, or when the car receives a [[Jump start (vehicle)|jump start]]. When the battery is disconnected while the engine is running, a [[load dump]] transient can produce very high voltages as the built in [[voltage regulator]] has been controlling the alternator field current to charge the vehicle battery and although it will attempt to reduce the field current to keep the output voltage constant, the field winding is highly inductive and setting the current to its new value takes several hundred milliseconds, during which the alternator output voltage will exceed its intended value. The load dump transient may also ruin the [[diode]]s in the [[alternator]] by exceeding their breakdown voltage. A car receiving a jump start from a truck may be subject to a 24&amp;nbsp;V electrical system used in some vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c984D31D2sQC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PWK0YWGbFG|title=Handbook of automotive power electronics and motor drives|first=Ali|last=Emadi|page=119|isbn=0-8247-2361-9|publisher=CRC press|date=2005-05-25|quote=The maximum operating voltage for 14&amp;nbsp;V systems is specified at 24&amp;nbsp;V, representing a double battery jump-start condition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a "double battery jump-start" is performed by some tow truck drivers in cold climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/an_pk/3893|work=High-Frequency Automotive Power Supplies|series=Application note 3893|date=2007-07-17|publisher=Maxim Integrated Products|title= Double-Battery Jump Start | quote = Another steady-state [[Overvoltage|OV]] condition is the double-battery jump start, which occurs when a [[tow truck]] or other service personnel use 24&amp;nbsp;V to jump-start a disabled vehicle or otherwise charge a dead battery. The typical [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] test requirement for this condition is about 24&amp;nbsp;V for two minutes. Some systems related to safety and engine management are required to operate under these conditions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equipment intended to be powered by the receptacle needs to account for intermittent contact, and voltages outside the nominal {{nowrap|12 V DC}}, such as maximum voltage {{nowrap|9–16 V}} continuously, or maximum voltage of {{nowrap|20 V}} lasting {{nowrap|1 hour}}, {{nowrap|24 V}} lasting {{nowrap|1 minute}}, and {{nowrap|40 V}} lasting {{nowrap|400 ms}}.&lt;ref name="fordemc"&gt;[http://www.fordemc.com/docs/download/EMC_CS_2009rev1.pdf fordemc.com - EMC_CS_2009rev1.pdf]{{dead link|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of protection component ratings tolerance is {{nowrap|+50}} to {{nowrap|−60 V DC}}.&lt;ref name="LM2931"&gt;{{cite web|title=LM2931 Datasheet|url=http://www.datasheetlib.com/datasheet/260207/lm2931_national-semiconductor.html|website=Datasheetlib|accessdate=2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robust equipment must tolerate temperatures varying between {{convert|-40|and|+85|°C}}, plus possible high humidity and condensation of water.&lt;ref name="fordemc"/&gt;

A '''closed-household economy''' is a society's [[economic system]] in which goods are not traded. Instead, those goods are produced and consumed by the same households. In other words, a closed-household economy is an economy where households are closed to [[Trade|trading]]. This kind of economy is present, for example, in [[hunter-gatherer]] societies.

The production and consumption of goods is not separated as in a society with high [[division of labor]].

The closed-household economy contrasts with a [[barter economy]], in which goods are bartered (traded against each other), and a [[monetary economy]], in which goods are traded for money.

The closed-household economy and the barter economy are together referred to as ''non-monetary economies''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25532">A '''cognitive model''' is an approximation to animal [[cognition|cognitive processes]] (predominantly human) for the purposes of comprehension and prediction. Cognitive models can be developed within or without a [[cognitive architecture]], though the two are not always easily distinguishable.

In contrast to cognitive architectures, cognitive models tend to be focused on a single cognitive phenomenon or process (e.g. list learning), how two or more processes interact (e.g. visual search and decision making), or to make behavioral predictions for a specific task or tool (e.g. how instituting a new software package will affect productivity). Cognitive architectures tend to be focused on the structural properties of the modeled system, and help constrain the development of cognitive models within the architecture. Likewise, model development helps to inform limitations and shortcomings of the architecture. Some of the most popular architectures for cognitive modeling include [[ACT-R]], [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|Clarion]], and [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]].

==History==
Cognitive modeling historically developed within [[cognitive psychology]]/[[cognitive science]] (including [[human factors]]), and has received contributions from the fields of [[machine learning]] and [[artificial intelligence]] to name a few. There are many types of cognitive models, and they can range from box-and-arrow diagrams to a set of equations to software programs that interact with the same tools that humans use to complete tasks (e.g., computer mouse and keyboard)&lt;ref&gt; Sun, R. (ed.), (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Box-and-arrow models==
A number of key terms are used to describe the processes involved in the perception, storage, and production of speech. Typically, they are used by speech pathologists while treating a child patient. The input signal is the speech signal heard by the child, usually assumed to come from an adult speaker. The output signal is the utterance produced by the child. The unseen psychological events that occur between the arrival of an input signal and the production of speech are the focus of psycholinguistic models. Events that process the input signal are referred to as input processes, whereas events that process the production of speech are referred to as output processes. Some aspects of speech processing are thought to happen online—that is, they occur during the actual perception
or production of speech and thus require a share of the attentional resources dedicated to the speech task. Other processes, thought to happen offline, take place as part of the child's background mental processing rather than during the time dedicated to the speech task.
In this sense, online processing is sometimes defined as occurring in real-time, whereas offline processing is said to be time-free (Hewlett, 1990). In box-and-arrow psycholinguistic models, each hypothesized level of representation or processing can be represented in a diagram by a “box,” and the relationships between them by “arrows,” hence the name. Sometimes (as in the models of Smith, 1973, and Menn, 1978, described later in this paper) the arrows represent processes additional to those shown in boxes. Such models make explicit the hypothesized information-
processing activities carried out in a particular cognitive function (such as language), in a manner analogous to computer flowcharts that depict the processes and decisions carried out by a computer program. Box-and-arrow models differ widely in the number of unseen psychological processes they describe and thus in the number of boxes they contain. Some have only one or two boxes between the input and output signals (e.g., Menn, 1978; Smith, 1973), whereas others have multiple boxes representing complex relationships between a number of different information-processing events (e.g., Hewlett, 1990; Hewlett, Gibbon, &amp; Cohen- McKenzie,1998; Stackhouse &amp; Wells, 1997). The most important box, however, and the source of much ongoing debate, is that representing the underlying representation (or UR). In essence, an underlying representation captures information stored in a child's mind about a word he or she knows and uses. As the following description of several models will illustrate, the nature of this information and thus the type(s) of representation present in the child's knowledge base have captured the attention of researchers for some time. (Elise Baker et al. Psycholinguistic Models of Speech Development and Their Application to Clinical Practice. Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research. June 2001. 44. p 685–702.)

==Computational models==
A [[computational model]] is a mathematical model in [[computational science]] that requires extensive computational resources to study the behavior of a complex system by computer simulation. The system under study is often a complex nonlinear system for which simple, intuitive analytical solutions are not readily available. Rather than deriving a mathematical analytical solution to the problem, experimentation with the model is done by changing the parameters of the system in the computer, and studying the differences in the outcome of the experiments. Theories of operation of the model can be derived/deduced from these computational experiments.
Examples of common computational models are weather forecasting models, earth simulator models, flight simulator models, molecular protein folding models, and neural network models.

Hybrid computers are computers that exhibit features of analog computers and digital computers. The digital component normally serves as the controller and provides logical operations, while the analog component normally serves as a solver of differential equations.

==Dynamical systems==
In the traditional [[Computer Simulation|computational approach]], [[Mental representation|representations]] are viewed as static structures of discrete [[Symbolic system|symbols]]. [[Cognition]] takes place by transforming static symbol structures in [[Discrete time|discrete]], sequential steps. [[Sensory system|Sensory]] information is transformed into symbolic inputs, which produce symbolic outputs that get transformed into [[Motor system|motor]] outputs. The entire system operates in an ongoing cycle.

What is missing from this traditional view is that human cognition happens [[Continuous function|continuously]] and in real time. Breaking down the processes into discrete time steps may not fully [[Mathematical model|capture]] this behavior. An alternative approach is to define a system with (1) a state of the system at any given time, (2) a behavior, defined as the change over time in overall state, and (3) a state set or [[State space (dynamical system)|state space]], representing the totality of overall states the system could be in.&lt;ref&gt;van Gelder, T. (1998). [https://static.cambridge.org/resource/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20170214115306027-0503:S0140525X98311735:S0140525X9800173Xa.pdf The dynamical hypothesis in cognitive science]. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 21, 615-665.&lt;/ref&gt; The system is distinguished by the fact that all of these states belong together. A change in any aspect of the system depends on other aspects of the system.&lt;ref&gt;van Gelder, T. &amp; Port, R. F. (1995). [http://cogsci.ucd.ie/connectionism/Articles/vanGelderPort.pdf It's about time: An overview of the dynamical Approach to cognition]. In R.F. Port and T. van Gelder (Eds.), Mind as motion: Explorations in the Dynamics of Cognition. (pp. 1-43). Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical [[Dynamical system|dynamical]] model is [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalized]] by several [[differential equation]]s that describe how the system's state changes over time.  By doing so, the form of the space of possible [[Orbit (dynamics)|trajectories]] and the internal and external forces that shape a specific trajectory that unfold over time, instead of the physical nature of the underlying [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] that manifest this dynamics, carry explanatory force. On this dynamical view, parametric inputs alter the system's intrinsic dynamics, rather than specifying an internal state that describes some external state of affairs.

===Early dynamical systems===

====Associative memory====
Early work in the application of dynamical systems to cognition can be found in the model of [[Hopfield network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfield, J. J. (1982). [http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/79/8/2554.full.pdf Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities]. PNAS, 79, 2554-2558.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hopfield, J. J. (1984). [http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/81/10/3088.full.pdf Neurons with graded response have collective computational properties like those of two-state neurons]. PNAS, 81, 3088-3092.&lt;/ref&gt; These networks were proposed as a model for [[associative memory (psychology)|associative memory]]. They represent the neural level of [[memory]], modeling systems of around 30 neurons which can be in either an on or off state.  By letting the [[Neural network|network]] learn on its own, structure and computational properties naturally arise. Unlike previous models, “memories” can be formed and recalled by inputting a small portion of the entire memory. Time ordering of memories can also be encoded. The behavior of the system is modeled with [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] which can change values, representing different states of the system. This early model was a major step toward a dynamical systems view of human cognition, though many details had yet to be added and more phenomena accounted for.

==== Language acquisition====
By taking into account the [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evolutionary development]] of the human [[nervous system]] and the similarity of the [[brain]] to other organs, [[Jeffrey Elman|Elman]] proposed that [[language]] and cognition should be treated as a dynamical system rather than a digital symbol processor.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, J. L. (1995). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.50.7356&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Language as a dynamical system]. In R.F. Port and T. van Gelder (Eds.), Mind as motion: Explorations in the Dynamics of Cognition. (pp. 195-223). Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Neural networks of the type Elman implemented have come to be known as [[Recurrent neural networks|Elman networks]].  Instead of treating language as a collection of static [[Lexicon|lexical]] items and [[grammar]] rules that are learned and then used according to fixed rules, the dynamical systems view defines the [[lexicon]] as regions of state space within a dynamical system. Grammar is made up of [[attractor]]s and repellers that constrain movement in the state space. This means that representations are sensitive to context, with mental representations viewed as trajectories through mental space instead of objects that are constructed and remain static. Elman networks were trained with simple sentences to represent grammar as a dynamical system. Once a basic grammar had been learned, the networks could then parse complex sentences by predicting which words would appear next according to the dynamical model.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, J. L. (1991). [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00114844.pdf Distributed representations, simple recurrent networks, and grammatical structure]. Machine Learning, 7, 195-225.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cognitive development====
A classic developmental error has been investigated in the context of dynamical systems:&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, J. P., Smith, L. B., &amp; Thelen, E. (2001). Tests of dynamical systems account of the A-not-B error: The influence of prior experience on the spatial memory abilities of two-year-olds. Child Development, 72(5), 1327-1346.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thelen"&gt;Thelen E., Schoner, G., Scheier, C., Smith, L. B. (2001). [https://static.cambridge.org/resource/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20170214114618504-0222:S0140525X01223917:S0140525X01003910a.pdf The dynamics of embodiment: A field theory of infant preservative reaching]. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 24, 1-86.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[A-not-B error]] is proposed to be not a distinct error occurring at a specific age (8 to 10 months), but a feature of a dynamic learning process that is also present in older children. Children 2 years old were found to make an error similar to the A-not-B error when searching for toys hidden in a sandbox. After observing the toy being hidden in location A and repeatedly searching for it there, the 2-year-olds were shown a toy hidden in a new location B. When they looked for the toy, they searched in locations that were biased toward location A. This suggests that there is an ongoing representation of the toy's location that changes over time. The child's past behavior influences its model of locations of the sandbox, and so an account of behavior and learning must take into account how the system of the sandbox and the child's past actions is changing over time.&lt;ref name="Thelen" /&gt;

====Locomotion====
One proposed mechanism of a dynamical system comes from analysis of continuous-time [[recurrent neural networks]] (CTRNNs).  By focusing on the output of the neural networks rather than their states and examining fully interconnected networks, three-neuron [[central pattern generator]] (CPG) can be used to represent systems such as leg movements during walking.&lt;ref&gt;Chiel, H. J., Beer, R. D., &amp; Gallagher, J. C. (1999). Evolution and analysis of model CPGs for walking. Journal of Computational Neuroscience, 7, 99-118.&lt;/ref&gt; This CPG contains three [[motor neuron]]s to control the foot, backward swing, and forward swing effectors of the leg. Outputs of the network represent whether the foot is up or down and how much force is being applied to generate [[torque]] in the leg joint. One feature of this pattern is that neuron outputs are either [[Binary number|off or on]] most of the time. Another feature is that the states are quasi-stable, meaning that they will eventually transition to other states. A simple pattern generator circuit like this is proposed to be a building block for a dynamical system. Sets of neurons that simultaneously transition from one quasi-stable state to another are defined as a dynamic module. These modules can in theory be combined to create larger circuits that comprise a complete dynamical system. However, the details of how this combination could occur are not fully worked out.

===Modern dynamical systems===

====Behavioral dynamics====
Modern formalizations of dynamical systems applied to the study of cognition vary. One such formalization, referred to as “behavioral dynamics”,&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;Warren, W. H. (2006). [http://rci.rutgers.edu/~persci/speakers/Warren_P%26A_PR06.pdf The dynamics of perception and action]. Psychological Review, 113(2), 359-389. doi: 10.1037/0033-295X.113.2.358&lt;/ref&gt; treats the [[Intelligent agent|agent]] and the environment as a pair of [[Coupling (physics)|coupled]] dynamical systems based on classical dynamical systems theory.  In this formalization, the information from the [[Environment (systems)|environment]] informs the agent's behavior and the agent's actions modify the environment. In the specific case of [[Motor cognition|perception-action cycles]], the coupling of the environment and the agent is formalized by two [[Function (mathematics)|functions]].  The first transforms the representation of the agents action into specific patterns of muscle activation that in turn produce forces in the environment.  The second function transforms the information from the environment (i.e., patterns of stimulation at the agent's receptors that reflect the environment's current state) into a representation that is useful for controlling the agents actions.  Other similar dynamical systems have been proposed (although not developed into a formal framework) in which the agent's nervous systems, the agent's body, and the environment are coupled together&lt;ref&gt;Beer, R. D. (2000). Dynamical approaches to cognitive science.  Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4(3), 91-99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beer, R. D. (2003). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.120.3706&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf The dynamics of active categorical perception in an evolved model agent]. Adaptive Behavior, 11(4), 209-243. doi: 10.1177/1059712303114001&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Adaptive behaviors=====
Behavioral dynamics have been applied to locomotive behavior.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fajen, B., R., &amp; Warren, W. H. (2003). [http://www.rc.unesp.br/ib/e_fisica/aplab/obstacle%20avoidance.pdf Behavioral dynamics of steering, obstacle avoidance, and route selection]. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 29, 343-362.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fajen, B. R., Warren, W. H., Temizer, S., &amp; Kaelbling, L. P. (2003). [http://cs.ait.ac.th/~mdailey/cvreadings/Fajen-Dynamical.pdf A dynamical model of visually-guided steering, obstacle avoidance, and route selection]. International Journal of Computer Vision, 54, 15-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Modeling locomotion with behavioral dynamics demonstrates that adaptive behaviors could arise from the interactions of an agent and the environment.  According to this framework, adaptive behaviors can be captured by two levels of analysis.  At the first level of perception and action, an agent and an environment can be conceptualized as a pair of dynamical systems coupled together by the forces the agent applies to the environment and by the structured information provided by the environment.  Thus, behavioral dynamics emerge from the agent-environment interaction.  At the second level of time evolution,  behavior can be expressed as a dynamical system represented as a vector field. In this vector field, attractors reflect stable behavioral solutions, where as bifurcations reflect changes in behavior.  In contrast to previous work on central pattern generators, this framework suggests that stable behavioral patterns are an emergent, self-organizing property of the agent-environment system rather than determined by the structure of either the agent or the environment.

====Open dynamical systems====
In an extension of classical [[dynamical systems theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Hotton, S., &amp; Yoshimi, J. (2010). The dynamics of embodied cognition. International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, 20(4), 943-972. doi: 10.1142/S0218127410026241&lt;/ref&gt; rather than coupling the environment's and the agent's dynamical systems to each other, an “open dynamical system” defines a “total system”, an “agent system”, and a mechanism to relate these two systems.  The total system is a dynamical system that models an agent in an environment, whereas the agent system is a dynamical system that models an agent's intrinsic dynamics (i.e., the agent's dynamics in the absence of an environment).  Importantly, the relation mechanism does not couple the two systems together, but rather continuously modifies the total system into the decoupled agent's total system. By distinguishing between total and agent systems, it is possible to investigate an agent's behavior when it is isolated from the environment and when it is embedded within an environment.  This formalization can be seen as a generalization from the classical formalization, whereby the agent system can be viewed as the agent system in an open dynamical system, and the agent coupled to the environment and the environment can be viewed as the total system in an open dynamical system.

=====Embodied cognition=====
In the context of dynamical systems and [[embodied cognition]], representations can be conceptualized as indicators or mediators.  In the indicator view, internal states carry information about the existence of an object in the environment, where the state of a system during exposure to an object is the representation of that object.  In the mediator view, internal states carry information about the environment which is used by the system in obtaining its goals. In this more complex account, the states of the system carries information that mediates between the information the agent takes in from the environment, and the force exerted on the environment by the agents behavior.  The application of open dynamical systems have been discussed for four types of classical embodied cognition examples:&lt;ref&gt;Hotton, S., &amp; Yoshimi, J. (2011). [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01151.x Extending dynamical systems theory to model embodied cognition]. Cognitive Science, 35, 444-479. doi: 10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01151.x&lt;/ref&gt;   
# Instances where the environment and agent must work together to achieve a goal, referred to as "intimacy". A classic example of intimacy is the behavior of simple agents working to achieve a goal (e.g., insects traversing the environment).  The successful completion of the goal relies fully on the coupling of the agent to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Haugeland, J. (1996). [https://philpapers.org/rec/HAUMEA Mind embodied and embedded]. In J. Haugeland (Ed.), Having thought: Essays in the metaphysics of mind (pp. 207-237). Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Instances where the use of external artifacts improves the performance of tasks relative to performance without these artifacts. The process is referred to as "offloading".  A classic example of offloading is the behavior of [[Scrabble]] players; people are able to create more words when playing Scrabble if they have the tiles in front of them and are allowed to physically manipulate their arrangement.  In this example, the Scrabble tiles allow the agent to offload [[working memory]] demands on to the tiles themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Maglio, P., Matlock, T., Raphaely, D., Chernickym B., &amp; Kirsh, D. (1999). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Kirsh/publication/2518995_Interactive_Skill_in_Scrabble/links/0912f51230e9fea0bb000000/Interactive-Skill-in-Scrabble.pdf Interactive skill in scrabble]. In M. Hahn &amp; S. C. Stoness (Eds.), Proceedings of twenty-first annual conference of the Cognitive Science Society, (pp. 326-330). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Instances where a functionally equivalent external artifact replaces functions that are normally performed internally by the agent, which is a special case of offloading.  One famous example is that of human (specifically the agents Otto and Inga) navigation in a complex environment with or without assistance of an artifact.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, A., &amp; Chalmers, D. (1998). [https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/1312/TheExtendedMind.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y The extended mind]. Analysis, 58(1), 7-19.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Instances where there is not a single agent. The individual agent is part of larger system that contains multiple agents and multiple artifacts. One famous example, formulated by [[Edwin Hutchins|Ed Hutchins]] in his book ''Cognition in the Wild'', is that of navigating a naval ship.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, E., (1995). [https://books.google.com/books?id=CGIaNc3F1MgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cognition in the wild]. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
The interpretations of these examples rely on the following [[Reason|logic]]: (1) the total system captures embodiment; (2) one or more agent systems capture the intrinsic dynamics of individual agents; (3) the complete behavior of an agent can be understood as a change to the agent's intrinsic dynamics in relation to its situation in the environment; and (4) the paths of an open dynamical system can be interpreted as representational processes.  These embodied cognition examples show the importance of studying the emergent dynamics of an agent-environment systems, as well as the intrinsic dynamics of agent systems.  Rather than being at odds with traditional cognitive science approaches, dynamical systems are a natural extension of these methods and should be studied in parallel rather than in competition.

The '''commons''' is the cultural and [[natural]] resources accessible to all members of a society, including natural materials such as air, water, and a habitable earth. These resources are held in common, not owned privately. Commons can also be understood as natural resources that groups of people (communities, user groups) manage for individual and collective benefit. Characteristically, this involves a variety of informal norms and values (social practice) employed for a governance mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Basu|first1=Soutrik|last2=Jongerden|first2=Joost|last3=Ruivenkamp|first3=Guido|title=Development of the drought tolerant variety Sahbhagi Dhan: exploring the concepts commons and community building|journal=International Journal of the Commons|date=17 March 2017|volume=11|issue=1|page=144||doi=10.18352/ijc.673|url=https://www.thecommonsjournal.org/articles/10.18352/ijc.673/|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Commons can be also defined as a social practice of governing a resource not by state or market but by a community of users that self-governs the resource through institutions that it creates .&lt;ref&gt; Classical theory based on Elinor Ostrom's book Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action.

The term "commons" derives from the traditional English legal term for [[common land]], which are also known as "commons", and was popularised in the modern sense as a shared resource term by the ecologist [[Garrett Hardin]] in an influential 1968 article called [[The Tragedy of the Commons]]. As Frank van Laerhoven and Elinor Ostrom have stated; "Prior to the publication of Hardin's article on the tragedy of the commons (1968), titles containing the words 'the commons', '[[common pool resource]]s', or 'common property' were very rare in the academic literature."&lt;ref&gt;Frank van Laerhoven and Elinor Ostrom. "[https://www.thecommonsjournal.org/articles/abstract/10.18352/ijc.76/ Traditions and Trends in the Study of the Commons]". ''International Journal of the Commons'', Vol. 1, no. 1, October 2007, pp. 3–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Some texts make a distinction in [[usage]] between [[common ownership]] of the commons and [[collective ownership]] among a group of colleagues, such as in a producers' [[cooperative]]. The precision of this distinction is not always maintained.

The use of "commons" for natural resources has its roots in European intellectual history, where it referred to shared agricultural fields, grazing lands and forests that were, over a period of several hundred years, enclosed, claimed as private property for private use. In European political texts, the common wealth was the totality of the material riches of the world, such as the air, the water, the soil and the seed, all nature's bounty regarded as the inheritance of humanity as a whole, to be shared together. In this context, one may go back further, to the Roman legal category ''res communis'', applied to things common to all to be used and enjoyed by everyone, as opposed to ''res publica'', applied to public property managed by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Basu|first1=Soutrik|last2=Jongerden|first2=Joost|last3=Ruivenkamp|first3=Guido|title=Development of the drought tolerant variety Sahbhagi Dhan: exploring the concepts commons and community building|url=https://www.thecommonsjournal.org/articles/10.18352/ijc.673/|website=International Journal of the Commons|date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of commons==

=== Environmental resource ===

The examples below illustrate types of environmental commons.

==== European land use ====

{{main article|Common land}}

Originally in [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval England]] the common was an integral part of the [[manor]], and was thus legally part of the [[estate in land]] owned by the [[lord of the manor]], but over which certain classes of manorial tenants and others held certain rights. By extension, the term "commons" has come to be applied to other resources which a community has rights or access to. The older texts use the word "common" to denote any such right, but more modern usage is to refer to particular rights of common, and to reserve the name "common" for the land over which the rights are exercised. A person who has a right in, or over, common land jointly with another or others is called a ''commoner''.&lt;ref name="Anon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/commoner |title=Commoner |last=Anon |publisher=Farlex Inc |accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In middle Europe, commons (relatively [[small-scale agriculture]] in, especially, southern Germany, Austria, and the alpine countries) were kept, in some parts, till the present.&lt;ref name="Rad" /&gt; Some studies have compared the German and English dealings with the commons between late medieval times and the agrarian reforms of the 18th and 19th centuries. The UK was quite radical in doing away with and enclosing former commons, while southwestern Germany (and the alpine countries as e.g. Switzerland) had the most advanced commons structures, and were more inclined to keep them. The [[Lower Rhine region]] took an intermediate position.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Zückert, "Allmende und Allmendaufhebung". ''Vergleichende Studien zum Spätmittelalter bis zu den Agrarreformen des 18./19. Jahrhunderts'' (= Quellen und Forschungen zur Agrargeschichte; Bd. 47), Stuttgart: Lucius &amp; Lucius 2003, IX + 462 S., 4 Farb-Abb., {{ISBN|978-3-8282-0226-9}} [http://www.sehepunkte.de/2004/10/5184.html review (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the UK and the former dominions have till today a large amount of [[Crown land]] which often is used for community or conservation purposes.

==== Mongolian grasslands ====

Based on a research project by the Environmental and Cultural Conservation in Inner Asia (ECCIA) from 1992 to 1995, satellite images were used to compare the amount of land degradation due to livestock grazing in the regions of Mongolia, Russia, and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sneath |first=David |title=State Policy and Pasture Degradation in Inner Asia |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/281/5380/1147.full?ijkey=2a465918ef9b55416bf136bee66c9175ccef1bdb&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha |work=Science Magazine |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mongolia, where shepherds were permitted to move collectively between seasonal grazing pastures, degradation remained relatively low at approximately 9%. Comparatively, Russia and China, which mandated state-owned pastures involving immobile settlements and in some cases privatization by household, had much higher degradation, at around 75% and 33% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ostrom |first=Elinor |title=Revisiting the Commons: Local Lessons, Global Challenges |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/284/5412/278.full |work=Science Magazine |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collaborative effort on the part of Mongolians proved much more efficient in preserving grazing land.

==== Lobster fishery of Maine ====

Widespread success of the Maine lobster industry is often attributed to the willingness of Maine's lobstermen to uphold and support lobster conservation rules. These rules include harbor territories not recognized by the state, informal trap limits, and laws imposed by the state of Maine (which are largely influenced by lobbying from lobster industry itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Acheson |first=James |title=Capturing the Commons: Devising Institutions to Manage the Maine Lobster |year=2004 |publisher=University Press of New England |url=https://books.google.com/?id=u23TkAVptOYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=james+acheson+lobster#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=9781584653936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the lobstermen collaborate without much government intervention to sustain their common-pool resource.

==== Community forests in Nepal ====

In the late 1980s, Nepal chose to decentralize government control over forests. Community forest programs work by giving local areas a financial stake in nearby woodlands, and thereby increasing the incentive to protect them from overuse. Local institutions regulate harvesting and selling of timber and land, and must use any profit towards community development and preservation of the forests. In twenty years, locals have noticed a visible increase in the number of trees. Community forestry may also contribute to community development in rural areas – for instance school construction, irrigation and drinking water channel construction, and road construction. Community forestry has proven conducive to democratic practices at grass roots level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mehta |first=Trupti Parekh |title=Community Forestry in India and Nepal |work=PERC Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Irrigation systems of New Mexico ====

{{Main article|Acequia}}

''Acequia'' is a method of collective responsibility and management for irrigation systems in desert areas. In New Mexico, a community-run organization known as Acequia Associations supervises water in terms of diversion, distribution, utilization, and recycling, in order to reinforce agricultural traditions and preserve water as a common resource for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Davidson-Harden |first=Adam |title=Local Control and Management of Our Water Commons: Stories of Rising to the Challenge |url=http://ourwatercommons.org/sites/default/files/local-control-management-water-commons.pdf |work=www.ourwatercommons.org |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural and intellectual commons===
Today, the commons are also understood within a [[cultural]] sphere. These commons include literature, music, arts, design, film, video, television, radio, information, software and sites of heritage. [[Wikipedia]] is an example of the production and maintenance of [[common good]]s by a contributor community in the form of encyclopedic knowledge that can be freely accessed by anyone without a central authority.&lt;ref&gt;Huberman, Bernardo A. and Romero, Daniel M. and Wu, Fang, Crowdsourcing, Attention and Productivity (September 12, 2008). {{DOI|10.2139/ssrn.1266996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tragedy of the commons]] in the Wiki-Commons is avoided by community control by individual authors within the Wikipedia community.&lt;ref&gt;"Avoiding Tragedy in the Wiki-Commons", by Andrew George, 12 Va. J.L. &amp; Tech. 8 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The information commons may help protect users of commons. Companies that pollute the environment release information about what they are doing. The Corporate Toxics Information Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Corporate Toxics Information Project |url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/Corporate-Toxics.298.0.html |work=[[Political Economy Research Institute]] |publisher=PERI-Umass |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725114045/http://www.peri.umass.edu/Corporate-Toxics.298.0.html |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and information like the Toxic 100, a list of the top 100 polluters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ash |first=Michael |title=Justice in the Air |url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/dpe/ctip/justice_in_the_air.pdf |work=PERI |publisher=PERI- Umass}}&lt;/ref&gt; helps people know what these corporations are doing to the environment.

===Digital commons===
{{Main article|Digital commons (economics)}}

[[Mayo Fuster Morell]] proposed a definition of digital commons as "information and knowledge resources that are collectively created and owned or shared between or among a community and that tend to be non-exclusive, that is, be (generally freely) available to third parties. Thus, they are oriented to favor use and reuse, rather than to exchange as a commodity. Additionally, the community of people building them can intervene in the governing of their interaction processes and of their shared resources."&lt;ref&gt;Fuster Morell, M. (2010, p. 5). Dissertation: ''Governance of online creation communities: Provision of infrastructure for the building of digital commons''. http://www.onlinecreation.info/?page_id=338&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berry |first=David |date=21 February 2005 |title=The commons |journal=[[Free Software Magazine]] |url=http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/commons_as_ideas |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of digital commons are [[Wikipedia]], [[free software]] and [[open-source hardware]] projects.

===Urban commons===
Urban commons present the opportunity for the citizens to gain power upon the management of the urban resources and reframe city-life costs based on their use value and maintenance costs, rather than the market-driven value.&lt;ref&gt;Dellenbaugh-Losse, M. (2017). "[https://urban-policy.com/2017/09/18/what-makes-urban-commons-different/ What makes urban commons different from other commons?]" ''Urban Policy''. Retrieved December 28, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:20110630 Indignados Syntagma general mass Athens Greece.jpg|thumb|Syntagma Square in Athens as urban commons]]
[[File:Tahrir Square - February 9, 2011.png|thumb|Tahrir Square in Cairo as urban commons]]
Urban commons situates citizens as key players rather than public authorities, private markets and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.shareable.net/sites/default/files/Sharing%20Cities.pdf Sharing Cities: activating the Urban Commons]. (2017). Mountain View: Shareable. Retrieved December 28, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; David Harvey (2012) defines the distinction between public spaces and urban commons. Public spaces and goods in the city make a commons when part of the citizens take political action. Syntagma Square in Athens, Tahrir Square in Cairo, and the Plaza de Catalunya in Barcelona were public spaces that transformed to an urban commons as people protested there to support their political statements. Streets are public spaces that have often become an urban commons by social action and revolutionary protests.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, D. (2013). "[http://abahlali.org/files/Harvey_Rebel_cities.pdf Rebel cities: from the right to the city to the urban revolution]". London: Verso&lt;/ref&gt;. Urban commons are operating in the cities in a complementary way with the state and the market. Some examples are community gardening, urban farms on the rooftops and cultural spaces&lt;ref&gt;C. Iaione. "[https://www.greeneuropeanjournal.eu/the-city-as-a-commons/ The city as a commons]" (personal communication, November 9, 2016) [Blog post]&lt;/ref&gt;. More recently participatory studies of commons and infrastructures under the conditions of the financial crisis emerge &lt;ref&gt;Dalakoglou, D. (2016).

City vol. 6 (2) &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; See also [http://www.infra-demos.net infra-demos] &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Knowledge commons===
In 2007, Elinor Ostrom along with her colleague Charlotte Hess, did succeed in extending the commons debate to knowledge, approaching knowledge as a complex ecosystem that operates as a common – a shared resource that is subject to social dilemmas. The focus here was on the ready availability of digital forms of knowledge and associated possibilities to store, access and share it as a common. The connection between knowledge and commons may be made through identifying typical problems associated with natural resource commons, such as congestion, overharvesting, pollution and inequities, which also apply to knowledge. Then, effective alternatives (community-based, non-private, non-state), in line with those of natural commons (involving social rules, appropriate property rights and management structures), solutions are proposed. Thus, the commons metaphor is applied to social practice around knowledge. It is in this context that the present work proceeds, discussing the creation of depositories of knowledge through the organised, voluntary contributions of scholars (the research community, itself a social common), the problems that such knowledge commons might face (such as free-riding or disappearing assets), and the protection of knowledge commons from enclosure and commodification (in the form of intellectual property legislation, patenting, licensing and overpricing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Basu|first1=Soutrik|last2=Jongerden|first2=Joost|last3=Ruivenkamp|first3=Guido|title=Development of the drought tolerant variety Sahbhagi Dhan: exploring the concepts commons and community building|journal=International Journal of the Commons|date=17 March 2017|volume=11|issue=1|page=144|doi=10.18352/ijc.673|url=https://www.thecommonsjournal.org/articles/10.18352/ijc.673/|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, it is important to note the nature of knowledge and its complex and multi-layered qualities of non-rivalry and non-excludability. Unlike natural commons – which are both rival and excludable (only one person can use any one item or portion at a time and in so doing they use it up, it is consumed) and characterised by scarcity (they can be replenished but there are limits to this, such that consumption/destruction may overtake production/creation) – knowledge commons are characterised by abundance (they are non-rival and non-excludable and thus, in principle, not scarce, so not impelling competition and compelling governance). This abundance of knowledge commons has been celebrated through alternative models of knowledge production, such as Commons Based Peer Production (CBPP), and embodied in the free software movement. The CBPP model showed the power of networked, open collaboration and non-material incentives to produce better quality products (mainly software).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Basu|first1=Soutrik|last2=Jongerden|first2=Joost|last3=Ruivenkamp|first3=Guido|title=The emergence of a hybrid mode of knowledge production in the Generation Challenge Programme Rice Research Network (GCP-RRN) in India: Exploring the concept of Commons-Based Peer Production (CBPP)|journal=Geoforum|volume=84|page=107|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2017.06.008|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718517301562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic theories==

===Tragedy of the commons===
{{Main article|Tragedy of the commons}}
A commons failure theory, now called [[tragedy of the commons]], originated in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Rad"&gt;{{harvnb|Radkau|2008|p=90, ff in the German text}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1833 [[William Forster Lloyd]] introduced the concept by a hypothetical example of herders overusing a shared parcel of land on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze, to the detriment of all users of the common land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lloyd |first=William Forster |title=Two Lectures on Population |year=1833 |jstor=1972412}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same concept has been called the "tragedy of the fishers", when over-fishing could cause stocks to plummet.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Bowles: Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution, [[Princeton University Press]], pp. 27–29 (2004) {{ISBN|0-691-09163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said the dissolution of the traditional land commons played a watershed role in landscape development and cooperative land use patterns and property rights.&lt;ref name=ws&gt;The end of the commons as a watershed' The Age of Ecology, Joachim Radkau, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 3 April 2014, p. 15 ff&lt;/ref&gt; However, as in the British Isles, such changes took place over several centuries as a result of land [[enclosure]].

Economist Peter Barnes has proposed a 'sky trust' to fix this tragedic problem in worldwide generic commons. He claims that the sky belongs to all the people, and companies do not have a right to over pollute. It is a type of cap and dividend program. Ultimately the goal would be to make polluting excessively more expensive than cleaning what is being put into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barnes |first=Peter |title=Pie in the Sky |year=2000 |publisher=Corporation for Enterprise Development |location=Washington D.C |isbn=1-883187-32-X |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Successful commons===
While the original work on the tragedy of the commons concept suggested that all commons were doomed to failure, they remain important in the modern world. Work by later economists has found many examples of successful commons, and [[Elinor Ostrom]] won the [[Nobel prize]] for analysing situations where they operate successfully.&lt;ref name=rifkin /&gt;&lt;ref name=governing&gt;{{cite book|author=Elinor Ostrom |year=2015 |title=Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action |isbn=9781107569782}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Ostrom found that grazing commons in the [[Swiss Alps]] have been run successfully for many hundreds of years by the farmers there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/06/12/154872185/remembering-elinor-ostrom-nobel-laureate NPR: Remembering Elinor Ostrom, Nobel Laureate Updated June 13, 201211:08 AM ET Published June 12, 20125:37 PM ET]&lt;/ref&gt;

Allied to this is the "comedy of the commons" concept, where users of the commons are able to develop mechanisms to police their use to maintain, and possibly improve, the state of the commons.{{r|comedy}} This term was coined in an essay by legal scholar, Carol M. Rose, in 1986.{{r|comedy}}&lt;ref name=rifkin /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Drama of the Commons

Other related concepts are the ''inverse commons'', ''[[cornucopia]] of the commons''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bricklin.com/cornucopia.htm|title=The Cornucopia of the Commons: How to get volunteer labor|website=www.bricklin.com|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and ''triumph of the commons''.&lt;ref name=bollier&gt;Silent Theft: The Private Plunder of Our Common Wealth By David Bollier&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cox /&gt; It is argued that some types of commons, such as [[open-source software]], work better in the cornucopia of the commons; proponents say that, in those cases, "the grass grows taller when it is grazed on".&lt;ref&gt;The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an … By Eric Raymond&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8152">'''Communication-Avoiding Algorithms''' minimize movement of data within a [[memory hierarchy]] for improving its running-time and energy consumption. These minimize the total of two costs (in terms of time and energy): arithmetic and communication. Communication, in this context refers to moving data, either between levels of memory or between multiple processors over a network. It is much more expensive than arithmetic.&lt;ref name="demmel2012"&gt;Demmel, Jim. "Communication avoiding algorithms." 2012 SC Companion: High Performance Computing, Networking Storage and Analysis. IEEE, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation ==
Consider the following running-time model:&lt;ref&gt;Demmel, James, and Kathy Yelick. "Communication Avoiding (CA) and Other Innovative Algorithms." The Berkeley Par Lab: Progress in the Parallel Computing Landscape: 243-250.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Measure of computation = Time per [[FLOP]] = γ
* Measure of communication = No. of words of data moved = β
⇒ Total running time = γ*(no. of [[FLOP]]s) + β*(no. of words)

From the fact that '''β &gt;&gt; γ''' as measured in time and energy, communication cost dominates computation cost. Technological trends&lt;ref name="darpa2008"&gt;Bergman, Keren, et al. "[http://staff.kfupm.edu.sa/ics/ahkhan/Resources/Articles/ExaScale%20Computing/TR-2008-13.pdf Exascale computing study: Technology challenges in exascale computing systems]." [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] [[Information Processing Techniques Office]] (DARPA IPTO), Tech. Rep 15 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that the relative cost of communication is increasing on a variety of platforms, from [[cloud computing]] to [[supercomputers]] to mobile devices. The report also predicts that gap between [[DRAM]] access time and FLOPs will increase 100x over coming decade to balance power usage between processors and DRAM.&lt;ref name="demmel2012"/&gt;

Energy consumption increases by orders of magnitude as we go higher in the memory hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Shalf, John, Sudip Dosanjh, and John Morrison. "Exascale computing technology challenges." High Performance Computing for Computational Science–VECPAR 2010. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2011. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; United States president Barack Obama cited Communication-Avoiding Algorithms in the FY 2012 Department of Energy budget request to Congress:&lt;ref name="demmel2012"/&gt; ''“New Algorithm Improves Performance and Accuracy on Extreme-Scale Computing Systems. '''On modern computer architectures, communication between processors takes longer than the performance of a floating point arithmetic operation by a given processor'''. ASCR researchers have developed a new method, derived from commonly used linear algebra methods, '''to minimize communications between processors and the memory hierarchy, by reformulating the communication patterns specified within the algorithm.''' This method has been implemented in the TRILINOS framework, a highly-regarded suite of software, which provides functionality for researchers around the world to solve large scale, complex multi-physics problems.”''

== Objective ==
Communication-Avoiding algorithms are designed with the following objectives:
* Reorganize algorithms to reduce communication across all memory hierarchies.
* Attain the lower-bound on communication when possible.

The following simple example&lt;ref name="demmel2012" /&gt; demonstrates how these are achieved.

=== Matrix Multiplication Example ===
Let A, B and C be square matrices of order n x n. The following naive algorithm implements C = C + A * B:

[[File:Matrix_multiplication_algorithm_diagram.png|500px|]]
  for i = 1 to n
      for j = 1 to n
          for k = 1 to n
          C(i,j) = C(i,j) + A(i,k) * B(k,j)

Arithmetic cost (time-complexity): n² (2n-1) for sufficiently large n or O(n³).

Rewriting this algorithm with communication cost labelled at each step

  for i = 1 to n
      {read row i of A into fast memory}               - n² reads
      for j = 1 to n
          {read C(i,j) into fast memory}               - n² reads
          {read column j of B into fast memory}        - n³ reads
          for k = 1 to n
              C(i,j) = C(i,j) + A(i,k) * B(k,j)
              {write C(i,j) back to slow memory}       - n² writes

Fast memory may be defined as the local processor memory ([[CPU cache]]) of size M and slow memory may be defined as the DRAM.

Communication cost (reads/writes): n³ + 3n² or O(n³)

Since total running time = γ*O(n³) + β*O(n³) and β &gt;&gt; γ the communication cost is dominant. The Blocked (Tiled) Matrix Multiplication algorithm&lt;ref name="demmel2012"/&gt; reduces this dominant term.

==== Blocked (Tiled) Matrix Multiplication ====

Consider A,B,C to be n/b-by-n/b matrices of b-by-b sub-blocks where b is called the block size;	assume 3 b-by-b blocks fit in fast memory.

[[File:Tiled_matrix_multiplication_diagram.png|500px|]]
     for i = 1 to n/b
         for j = 1 to n/b
         {read block C(i,j) into fast memory}           - b² × (n/b)² = n² reads
         for k = 1 to n/b
             {read block A(i,k) into fast memory}       - b² × (n/b)³ = n³/b reads 
             {read block B(k,j) into fast memory}       - b² × (n/b)³ = n³/b reads
             C(i,j) = C(i,j) + A(i,k) * B(k,j)          - {do a matrix multiply on blocks}
         {write block C(i,j) back to slow memory}       - b² × (n/b)² = n² writes

Communication cost: 2n³/b + 2n² reads/writes &lt;&lt; 2n³ arithmetic cost

Making b as large possible:
3b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ M 
We achieve the following communication lowerbound:
3&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/M&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;  + 2n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  or Ω(no. of FLOPs / M&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; )

== Previous approaches for reducing communication == 
Most of the approaches investigated in the past to address this problem rely on scheduling or tuning techniques that aim at overlapping communication with computation. However, this approach can lead to an improvement of at most a factor of two. Ghosting is a different technique for reducing communication, in which a processor stores and computes redundantly data from neighboring processors for future computations. Cache-oblivious algorithms represent a different approach introduced in 1999 for Fast Fourier Transforms,&lt;ref&gt;M. Frigo, C. E. Leiserson, H. Prokop, and S. Ramachandran, “Cacheoblivious algorithms,” In FOCS ’99: Proceedings of the 40th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 1999. IEEE Computer Society.&lt;/ref&gt; and then extended to graph algorithms, dynamic programming, etc. They were also applied to several operations in linear algebra&lt;ref&gt;S.

The design of architecture specific algorithms is another approach that can be used for reducing the communication in parallel algorithms, and there are many examples in the literature of algorithms that are adapted to a given communication topology.&lt;ref&gt;Grigori, Laura.

In [[mathematics]], especially in [[order theory]], a '''complete Heyting algebra''' is a [[Heyting algebra]] that is [[completeness (order theory)|complete]] as a [[lattice (order)|lattice]]. Complete Heyting algebras are the [[object (category theory)|objects]] of three different [[category (category theory)|categories]]; the category '''CHey''', the category '''Loc''' of locales, and its [[opposite (category theory)|opposite]], the category '''Frm''' of frames. Although these three categories contain the same  objects, they differ in their [[morphism]]s, and thus get distinct names. Only the morphisms of '''CHey''' are [[homomorphism]]s of complete Heyting algebras.

Locales and frames form the foundation of [[pointless topology]], which, instead of building on [[point-set topology]], recasts the ideas of [[general topology]] in categorical terms, as statements on frames and locales.

== Definition ==
Consider a [[partially ordered set]] (''P'', ≤) that is a [[complete lattice]]. Then ''P'' is a ''complete Heyting algebra'' if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:
* ''P'' is a Heyting algebra, i.e. the operation {{nowrap|1=( ''x'' &amp;and; &amp;minus; )}} has a [[Adjoint functors|right adjoint]] (also called the lower adjoint of a (monotone) [[Galois connection]]), for each element ''x'' of ''P''.
* For all elements ''x'' of ''P'' and all subsets ''S'' of ''P'', the following infinite [[distributivity (order theory)|distributivity]] law holds:
: &lt;math&gt;x \wedge \bigvee_{s \in S} s = \bigvee_{s \in S} (x \wedge s).&lt;/math&gt;
* ''P'' is a distributive lattice, i.e., for all ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' in ''P'', we have
: &lt;math&gt;x \wedge ( y \vee z ) = ( x \wedge y ) \vee ( x \wedge z )&lt;/math&gt;

: and the meet operations {{nowrap|1=( ''x'' &amp;and; &amp;minus; )}} are [[Scott continuous]] for all ''x'' in ''P'' (i.e., preserve the suprema of [[directed set]]s) .

==Examples==
The system of all open sets of a given [[topological space]] ordered by inclusion is a complete Heyting algebra.

== Frames and locales ==
The [[object (category theory)|objects]] of the category '''CHey''', the category '''Frm''' of frames and the category '''Loc''' of locales are the complete lattices satisfying the infinite distributive law. These categories differ in what constitutes a [[morphism]].

The morphisms of '''Frm''' are (necessarily [[monotonic|monotone]]) functions that [[limit preserving function (order theory)|preserve]] finite meets and arbitrary joins. Such functions are not homomorphisms of complete Heyting algebras.  The definition of Heyting algebras crucially involves the existence of right adjoints to the binary meet operation, which together define an additional [[implication operation]] ⇒. Thus, a ''homomorphism of complete Heyting algebras'' is a morphism of frames that in addition preserves implication. The morphisms of '''Loc''' are [[dual (category theory)|opposite]] to those of '''Frm''', and they are usually called maps (of locales).

The relation of locales and their maps to topological spaces and continuous functions may be seen as follows. Let
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt;
be any map. The [[power set]]s ''P''(''X'') and ''P''(''Y'') are [[complete Boolean algebra]]s, and the map
: &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\colon P(Y)\to P(X)&lt;/math&gt;
is a homomorphism of complete Boolean algebras. Suppose the spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[topological space]]s, endowed with the topology ''O''(''X'') and ''O''(''Y'') of [[open set]]s on ''X'' and ''Y''. Note that ''O''(''X'') and ''O''(''Y'') are subframes of ''P''(''X'') and ''P''(''Y''). If ''ƒ'' is a continuous function, then
: &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\colon O(Y)\to O(X)&lt;/math&gt;
preserves finite meets and arbitrary joins of these subframes.  This shows that ''O'' is a [[functor]] from the category '''Top''' of topological spaces to the category '''Loc''' of locales, taking any continuous map
: &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt;
to the map
: &lt;math&gt;O(f)\colon O(X)\to O(Y)&lt;/math&gt;
in '''Loc''' that is defined in '''Frm''' to be the inverse image frame homomorphism
: &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\colon O(Y)\to O(X).&lt;/math&gt;
It is common, given a map of locales
: &lt;math&gt;f\colon A\to B&lt;/math&gt;
in '''Loc''', to write
: &lt;math&gt;f^{*}\colon B\to A&lt;/math&gt;
for the frame homomorphism that defines it in '''Frm'''. Hence, using this notation, ''O''(''ƒ'') is defined by the equation {{nowrap|1=''O''(''&amp;fnof;'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

Conversely, any locale ''A'' has a topological space ''S''(''A'') that best approximates the locale, called its ''spectrum''. In addition, any map of locales
: &lt;math&gt;f\colon A\to B&lt;/math&gt;
determines a continuous map
: &lt;math&gt;S(A)\to S(B),&lt;/math&gt;
and this assignment is functorial: letting ''P''(1) denote the locale that is obtained as the powerset of the terminal set {{nowrap|1=1 = { * },}} the points of ''S''(''A'') are the maps
: &lt;math&gt;p\colon P(1)\to A&lt;/math&gt;
in '''Loc''', i.e., the frame homomorphisms
: &lt;math&gt;p^*\colon A\to P(1).&lt;/math&gt;
For each {{nowrap|1=''a'' &amp;isin; ''A''}} we define the set {{nowrap|1=''U&lt;sub&gt;a''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;sube; ''S''(''A'')}} that consists of the points {{nowrap|1=''p'' &amp;isin; ''S''(''A'')}} such that {{nowrap|1=''p''*(''a'') = { * }.}} It is easy to verify that this defines a frame homomorphism {{nowrap|1=''A'' &amp;rarr; ''P''(''S''(''A'')),}} whose image is therefore a topology on ''S''(''A''). Then, if
: &lt;math&gt;f\colon A\to B&lt;/math&gt; is a map of locales,
to each point {{nowrap|1=''p'' &amp;isin; ''S''(''A'')}} we assign the point ''S''(''ƒ'')(''q'') defined by letting ''S''(''ƒ'')(p)* be the composition of ''p''* with ''ƒ''*, hence obtaining a continuous map
: &lt;math&gt;S(f)\colon S(A)\to S(B).&lt;/math&gt;

This defines a functor &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; from '''Loc''' to '''Top''', which is right adjoint to ''O''.

Any locale that is isomorphic to the topology of its spectrum is called ''spatial'', and any topological space that is homeomorphic to the spectrum of its locale of open sets is called ''sober''. The adjunction between topological spaces and locales restricts to an [[equivalence of categories]] between sober spaces and spatial locales.

Any function that preserves all joins (and hence any frame homomorphism) has a right adjoint, and, conversely, any function that preserves all meets has a left adjoint. Hence, the category '''Loc''' is isomorphic to the category whose objects are the frames and whose morphisms are the meet preserving functions whose left adjoints preserve finite meets. This is often regarded as a representation of '''Loc''', but it should not be confused with '''Loc''' itself, whose morphisms are formally the same as frame homomorphisms in the opposite direction.

==Ancient Mesopotamia==

[[File:Lamashtu plaque 9167.jpg|thumb|Bronze protection plaque from the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian era]] showing the demon [[Lamashtu]]]]
The ancient [[Mesopotamia]]ns believed that magic was the only viable defense against [[demon]]s, [[ghost]]s, and evil sorcerers.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farber|first=Walter|date=1995|title=Witchcraft, Magic, and Divination in Ancient Mesopotamia|url=http://wsrp.usc.edu/information/REL499_2011/Witchcraft,%20Magic,%20and%20Divination%20in%20Ancient%20Mesopotamia.pdf|journal=Civilizations of the Ancient Near East|volume=3|location=New York City, New York|publisher=Charles Schribner’s Sons, MacMillan Library Reference USA, Simon &amp; Schuster MacMillan|pages=1891-1908|isbn=978-0-68-419279-6|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; To defend themselves against the spirits of those they had wronged, they would leave offerings known as ''kispu'' in the person's tomb in hope to appease them.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; If that did not work, they also sometimes took a figurine of the deceased and buried it in the ground, demanding for the gods to eradicate the spirit, or force it to leave the person alone.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt;

The ancient Mesopotamians also used magic to protect themselves from evil sorcerers who might place curses on them.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; They had no distinction between "light magic" and "black magic" and a person defending him or herself from witchcraft would use exactly the same techniques as the person trying to curse someone.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; The only major difference was the fact that curses were enacted in secret;&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; whereas a defense against sorcery was conducted in the open, in front of an audience if possible.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; One ritual to punish a sorcerer was known as [[Maqlû]], or "The Burning".&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; The person afflicted by the witchcraft would create an effigy of the sorcerer and put it on trial at night.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; Then, once the nature of the sorcerer’s crimes had been determined, the person would burn the effigy and thereby break the sorcerer’s power over him or her.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt;

The ancient Mesopotamians also performed magical rituals to purify themselves of sins committed unknowingly.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; One such ritual was known as the [[Šurpu]], or "Burning",&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; in which the caster of the spell would transfer the guilt for all his or her misdeeds onto various objects such as a strip of dates, an onion, and a tuft of wool.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; He or she would then burn the objects and thereby purify him or herself of all sins that he or she might have unknowingly committed.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; A whole genre of love spells existed.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; Such spells, which usually invoked the aid of the goddess [[Ishtar]], were believed to cause a person to fall in love with another person, restore love which had faded, or cause a male sexual partner to be able to sustain an erection when he had previously been unable.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; Other spells were used to reconcile a man with his patron deity or to reconcile a wife with a husband who had been neglecting her.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt;

The Sumerian god [[Enki]], who was later syncretized with the [[East Semitic]] god Ea, was closely associated with magic and incantations;&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; he was the patron god of the ''bārȗ'' and the ''ašipū'' and was widely regarded as the ultimate source of all arcane knowledge.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; The ancient Mesopotamians also believed in [[omen]]s, which could come when solicited or unsolicited.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; Regardless of how they came, omens were always taken with the utmost seriousness.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; The Mesopotamians also invented [[astrology]].&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt;

==Ancient Egypt==

[[File:Wedjat (Udjat) Eye of Horus pendant.jpg|thumb|Ancient Egyptian [[Eye of Horus]] amulet]]
Magic was an integral part of ancient Egyptian religion and culture.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brier|first1=Bob|last2=Hobbs|first2=Hoyt|date=2009|title=Ancient Egypt: Everyday Life in the Land of the Nile|location=New York City, New York|publisher=Sterling|isbn=978-1-4549-0907-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|66}} The ancient Egyptians would often wear magical amulets, known as ''meket'', for protection.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|66}} The most common material for such amulets was a kind of ceramic known as [[faience]], but amulets were also made of stone, metal, bone, and wood.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|66}} Amulets depicted specific symbols.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|67}} One of the most common protective symbols was the [[Eye of Horus]], which represented the new eye given to [[Horus]] by the god [[Thoth]] as a replacement for his old eye, which had been destroyed during a battle with Horus’s uncle Seth.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|67}} The most popular amulet was the scarab beetle, the emblem of the god [[Khepri]].&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|67}} Pregnant women would wear amulets depicting Tauret, the goddess of childbirth, to protect against miscarriage.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|44}} The god [[Bes]], who had the head of a lion and the body of a dwarf, was believed to be the protector of children.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|44}} After giving birth, a mother would remove her Tauret amulet and put on a new amulet representing Bes.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|44}}
 
Like the Mesopotamians, the ancient Egyptians had no distinction between magic and medicine.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mark|first=Joshua|date=2017|title=Magic in Ancient Egypt|website=ancient.eu|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|url=http://www.ancient.eu/article/1019/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians believed that diseases stemmed from supernatural origins&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; and ancient Egyptian doctors would prescribe both magical and practical remedies to their patients.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; Doctors would interrogate their patients to find out what ailments the person was suffering from. The symptoms of the disease determined which deity the doctor needed to invoke in order to cure it. 
Doctors were extremely expensive,&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; so, for most everyday purposes, the average Egyptian would have relied on individuals who were not professional doctors, but who possessed some form of medical training or knowledge.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; Among these individuals were folk healers and seers, who could set broken bones, aid mothers in giving birth, proscribe herbal remedies for common ailments, and interpret dreams.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; If a doctor or seer was unavailable, then everyday people would simply cast their spells on their own without assistance.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; Although most Egyptians were illiterate, it was likely commonplace for individuals to memorize spells and incantations for later use.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt;

The main principle behind Egyptian magic seems to have been the notion that, if a person said something with enough conviction, the statement would automatically become true.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|54}} The interior walls of the pyramid of Unas, the final pharaoh of the Egyptian Fifth Dynasty, are covered in hundreds of magical spells and inscriptions, running from floor to ceiling in vertical columns.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|54}} These inscriptions are known as the "[[Pyramid Texts]]"&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|54}} and they contain spells needed by the pharaoh in order to survive in the [[Egyptian afterlife|Afterlife]].&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|54}} The Pyramid Texts were strictly for royalty only;&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}} the spells were kept secret from commoners and were written only inside royal tombs.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}} During the chaos and unrest of the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]], however, tomb robbers broke into the pyramids and saw the magical inscriptions.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}} Commoners began learning the spells and, by the beginning of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], commoners began inscribing similar writings on the sides of their own coffins, hoping that doing so would ensure their own survival in the Afterlife.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}} These writings are known as the "[[Coffin Texts]]". &lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}}

Eventually, the Coffin Texts became so extensive that they no longer fit on the outside of a coffin.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}} They began to be instead recorded on scrolls of papyrus, which would then be placed inside the coffin with the deceased’s own corpse.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}} The writings on these scrolls are now known as ''[[The Book of the Dead]]''.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}} There were hundreds of different versions of ''The Book of the Dead'', all of them containing different spells.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}} Egyptologists have identified more than four hundred different spells belonging to ''The Book of the Dead'' collectively.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}} Egyptologists have codified and classified these spells, assigning them specific numbers based on their content and purpose.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}}

As ''The Book of the Dead'' became more popular, a whole industry of scribes arose for the sole purpose of copying manuscripts so that customers would be able to buy copies of the spells to be buried with them in their tombs.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56-57}} The quality of manuscripts was highly variable.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56-57}} Some editions were ninety feet long and contained beautiful, color illustrations to illuminate the text;&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56-57}} others were short with no illustrations whatsoever.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56-57}} The scrolls were copied before they were bought, meaning that the name of the owner was unknown.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56-57}} As such, the scribes would leave the places for the person’s name blank and fill in the person's name after the scroll was purchased.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56-57}} Sometimes scribes would accidentally misread or miscopy what they were writing.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56-57}} Sometimes the spells would be abbreviated in order to avoid running out of space.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56-57}} Such mistakes could render the texts unintelligible. &lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56-57}}

After a person died, his or her corpse would be mummified and wrapped in linen bandages in order to ensure that the deceased's body would survive for as long as possible&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; because the Egyptians believed that a person's soul could only survive in the Afterlife for as long as his or her physical body survived here on earth.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; The last ceremony before a person's body was sealed away inside the tomb was known as the "[[Opening of the mouth ceremony|Opening of the Mouth]]".&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; In this ritual, the priests would touch various magical instruments to various parts of the deceased's body, thereby giving the deceased the ability to see, hear, taste, and smell in the Afterlife.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt;

Before dead person was buried, his or her mummified corpse would be stuffed full of magic amulets and protective charms in order to ensure that he or she would be safe in the next world.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; The family would also place important grave goods inside the person’s tomb in order to ensure that he or she had everything he or she would need in the next life.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; Among these grave goods were small figurines made of faience or wood known as ''[[Ushabti|shabti]]''. The shabti were intended as slaves for the deceased.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; The ancient Egyptians believed that physical labor was just as necessary in the Afterlife as it was in the present one.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; As such, they believed that the deceased could cast a spell to animate these figurines so that he or she would be able to order them to perform tasks and chores in the Afterlife so that the deceased him or herself would not be forced to perform any labor.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt;

[[File:Hécate - Mallarmé.png|thumb|[[Hecate]], the ancient Greek goddess of magic.]]

Ancient Greek scholarship of the 20th century, almost certainly influenced by Christianising preconceptions of the meanings of magic and religion, and the wish to establish Greek culture as the foundation of Western rationality, developed a theory of ancient Greek magic as primitive and insignificant, and thereby essentially separate from [[Homeric]], communal ("''polis''") religion. Since the last decade of the century, however, recognising the ubiquity and respectability of acts such as ''katadesmoi'' ("[[Curse tablet|binding spells]]"), described as magic by modern and ancient observers alike, scholars have been compelled to abandon this viewpoint.&lt;ref name="Kindt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kindt|first1=Julia|title=Rethinking Greek Religion|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521110920}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|90–95}} The Greek word ''mageuo'' ("practise magic") itself derives from the word ''[[Magi|Magos]]'', originally simply the Greek name for a [[Iran#Classical antiquity|Persian tribe]] known for practising religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Copenhaver|first1=Brian P.|title=Magic in Western Culture: From Antiquity to the Enlightenment|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781107070523|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-civic "[[mystery cults]]" have been similarly re-evaluated:&lt;ref name="Kindt"/&gt;{{rp|97–98}}

'' [[Curse tablet|Katadesmoi'' (Latin: '' defixiones)]]''), curses inscribed on wax or lead tablets and buried underground, were frequently executed by all strata of Greek society, sometimes to protect the entire ''polis''.&lt;ref name="Kindt"/&gt;{{rp|95–96}} Communal curses carried out in public declined after the Greek classical period, but private curses remained common throughout antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinnells|first1=John|title=The Penguin Handbook of Ancient Religions|date=2009|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=0141956666|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were distinguished as magical by their individualistic, instrumental and sinister qualities.&lt;ref name="Kindt"/&gt;{{rp|96}} These qualities, and their perceived deviation from inherently mutable cultural constructs of normality, most clearly delineate ancient magic from the religious rituals of which they form a part.&lt;ref name="Kindt"/&gt;{{rp|102–103}}

==Middle Ages==

{{Further information|Medieval European magic}}
Ars Magica or magic is a major component and supporting contribution to the belief and practice of spiritual, and in many cases, physical healing throughout the Middle Ages. Emanating from many modern interpretations lies a trail of misconceptions about magic, one of the largest revolving around wickedness or the existence of nefarious beings who practice it. These misinterpretations stem from numerous acts or rituals that have been performed throughout antiquity, and due to their exoticism from the commoner's perspective, the rituals invoked uneasiness and an even stronger sense of dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flint|first1=Valerie I.J.|title=The Rise of Magic in Early Medieval Europe|date=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0691031657|pages=4, 12, 406|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated813"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kieckhefer|first1=Richard|title=The Specific Rationality of Medieval Magic|journal=The American Historical Review|date=June 1994|volume=99|issue=3|pages=813–818|doi=10.2307/2167771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One societal force in the Middle Ages more powerful than the singular commoner, the Christian Church, rejected magic as a whole because it was viewed as a means of tampering with the natural world in a supernatural manner associated with the [[Bible|biblical]] verses of Deuteronomy 18:9-12. Despite the many negative connotations which surround the term magic, there exist many elements that are seen in a divine or holy light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=David C.|title=The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, 600 B.C. to A.D. 1450|date=2007|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226482057|page=20|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various yet sparse healers of the Middle Ages were among the few, if not the only, proponents of a positive impression of magic. One of the most famous healers of this time was [[Hildegard of Bingen|Saint Hildegard of Bingen]]. Her healing abilities were so sought after that many individuals, healthy and ill alike, would travel great distances to be blessed by her.&lt;ref name="Sweet"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweet|first1=Victoria|title=Hildegard of Bingen and the Greening of Medieval Medicine|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|date=1999|volume=73|issue=3|pages=381–403|doi=10.1353/bhm.1999.0140|pmid=10500336|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/bulletin_of_the_history_of_medicine/v073/73.3sweet.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians of medicine along with the people of the Middle Ages both possess no straightforward answer as to where her abilities derived from; however, many of these historians argue or speculate that they are related to mental visions of which recorded documents, such as her three volumes of visionary theology, depict. The volumes include: [[Scivias]], ("Know the Ways"), [[Hildegard of Bingen#Liber Vitae Meritorum|Liber Vitae Meritorum]], ("Book of Life's Merits"), and [[Liber Divinorum Operum]] ("Book of Divine Works").&lt;ref name="Sweet"/&gt;

Diversified instruments or rituals used in medieval magic include, but are not limited to: various amulets, talismans, potions, as well as specific chants, dances, prayers. Along with these rituals are the adversely imbued notions of demonic participation which influence of them. The idea that magic was devised, taught, and worked by demons would have seemed reasonable to anyone who read the Greek magical papyri or the [[Sepher Ha-Razim|Sefer-ha-Razim]] and found that healing magic appeared alongside rituals for killing people, gaining wealth, or personal advantage, and coercing women into sexual submission.&lt;ref name="autogenerated813"/&gt; Archaeology is contributing to a fuller understanding of ritual practices performed in the home, on the body and in monastic and church settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilchrist|first1=Roberta|title=Magic for the Dead?

The [[Islam]]ic reaction towards magic did not condemn magic in general and distinguished between magic which can heal sickness and [[Demonic possession#Islam|possession]], and sorcery. Magic is therefore a ''special gift from [[God in Islam|God]]'', while the latter is achieved through help of [[Jinn]] and [[Devil (Islam)|devils]]. [[Ibn al-Nadim]] hold, [[Exorcist]]s gain their power by their obedience to God, while sorcerers please the devils by acts of disobidience and sacrifices and they in return do him a favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=El-Zein|first1=Amira|title=Islam, Arabs, and the Intelligent World of the Jinn|date=2009|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, New York|isbn=9780815650706|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ibn Arabi]] [[Al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yusuf al-Shubarbuli]] was due to his piety able to walk on water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lebling|first1=Robert|title=Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar|date=2010|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857730633|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[Quran]], regarding Islamic legends of [[Solomon in Islam|Solomon]], magic was taught by devils to the humans. Solomon took the [[Testament of Solomon|writings]] of the sorcerer away and hid them under his throne. After his death, [[Iblis]], unable to get close to Solomons court, told the people, they will find a treasure under the throne and thus lead them to sorcery. Another account hold, sorcery came with the [[Fallen angel#Islam|fallen angels]] [[Harut and Marut]] to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nasr|first1=Seyyed Hossein|last2=Dagli|first2=Caner K.|last3=Dakake|first3=Maria Massi|last4=Lumbard|first4=Joesph E.B.|last5=Rustom|first5=Mohammed|title=The Study Quran; A New Translation and Commentary|date=2015|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=9780062227621|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance==

{{Further information|Renaissance magic}}
[[Renaissance]] [[humanism]] saw a resurgence in [[hermeticism]] and [[Neo-Platonic]] varieties of [[ceremonial magic]]. The Renaissance, on the other hand, saw the rise of [[science]], in such forms as the dethronement of the [[Ptolemaic theory]] of the universe, the distinction of astronomy from astrology, and of chemistry from alchemy.&lt;ref name="Kiekhefer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kieckhefer|first1=Richard|title=Forbidden Rites: A Necromancer's Manual of the Fifteenth Century|date=2002|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pennsylvania|isbn=0271017511|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

There was great uncertainty in distinguishing practices of superstition, occultism, and perfectly sound scholarly knowledge or pious ritual. The intellectual and spiritual tensions erupted in the Early Modern [[witch-hunt|witch craze]], further reinforced by the turmoil of the [[Protestant Reformation]], especially in Germany, England, and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Kiekhefer"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

Sorcery is a legal concept in [[Papua New Guinea]] law, which differentiates between legal good magic, such as healing and fertility, and illegal black magic, held responsible for unexplained deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Cannibal cult members arrested in PNG|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10817610|newspaper = New Zealand Herald|date = 2012-07-05|access-date = 2015-11-28|issn = 1170-0777|language = en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the idea of '''descent''' extends the intuitive idea of 'gluing' in [[topology]]. Since the [[quotient space (topology)|topologists' glue]] is the use of [[equivalence relation]]s on [[topological space]]s, the theory starts with some ideas on identification.
&lt;!--A sophisticated theory resulted. It was a tribute to the efforts to use [[category theory]] to get around the alleged 'brutality'{{clarify|date=April 2013}} of imposing equivalence relations within geometric categories. One outcome was the eventual definition adopted in [[topos theory]] of [[geometric morphism]], to get the correct notion of [[surjection|surjectivity]].--&gt;

==Descent of vector bundles==

The case of the construction of [[vector bundle]]s from data on a [[disjoint union]] of [[topological space]]s is a straightforward place to start.

Suppose ''X'' is a topological space covered by open sets ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Let ''Y'' be the [[disjoint union]] of the ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', so that there is a natural mapping

:&lt;math&gt;p: Y \rightarrow X.&lt;/math&gt;

We think of ''Y'' as 'above' ''X'', with the ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' projection 'down' onto ''X''. With this language, ''descent'' implies a vector bundle on ''Y ''(so, a bundle given on each ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''), and our concern is to 'glue' those bundles ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', to make a single bundle ''V'' on X. What we mean is that ''V'' should, when restricted to ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', give back ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', [[up to]] a bundle isomorphism.

The data needed is then this: on each overlap

:&lt;math&gt;X_{ij},&lt;/math&gt;

intersection of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, we'll require mappings

:&lt;math&gt;f_{ij}: V_i \rightarrow V_j&lt;/math&gt;

to use to identify ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' there, fiber by fiber. Further the ''f&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' must satisfy conditions based on the reflexive, symmetric and transitive properties of an equivalence relation (gluing conditions). For example, the composition

:&lt;math&gt;f_{jk} \circ f_{ij} = f_{ik}&lt;/math&gt;

for transitivity (and choosing apt notation). The ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ii''&lt;/sub&gt; should be identity maps and hence symmetry becomes &lt;math&gt;f_{ij}=f^{-1}_{ji}&lt;/math&gt; (so that it is fiberwise an isomorphism).

These are indeed standard conditions in [[fiber bundle]] theory (see [[transition map]]). One important application to note is ''change of fiber'': if the ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; are all you need to make a bundle, then there are many ways to make an [[associated bundle]]. That is, we can take essentially same ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, acting on various fibers.

Another major point is the relation with the [[chain rule]]: the discussion of the way there of constructing [[tensor field]]s can be summed up as 'once you learn to descend the [[tangent bundle]], for which transitivity is the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] chain rule, the rest is just 'naturality of tensor constructions'.

To move closer towards the abstract theory we need to interpret the disjoint union of the

:&lt;math&gt;X_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

now as

:&lt;math&gt;Y \times_X Y,&lt;/math&gt;

the [[fiber product]] (here an [[Equaliser (mathematics)|equalizer]]) of two copies of the projection p. The bundles on the ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; that we must control are ''V''&amp;prime; and ''V''", the pullbacks to the fiber of ''V'' via the two different projection maps to ''X''.

Therefore, by going to a more abstract level one can eliminate the combinatorial side (that is, leave out the indices) and get something that makes sense for ''p'' not of the special form of covering with which we began. This then allows a [[category theory]] approach: what remains to do is to re-express the gluing conditions.

==History==

The ideas were developed in the period 1955–1965 (which was roughly the time at which the requirements of [[algebraic topology]] were met but those of [[algebraic geometry]] were not). From the point of view of abstract [[category theory]] the work of [[comonad]]s of Beck was a summation of those ideas; see [[Beck's monadicity theorem]].

The difficulties of algebraic geometry with passage to the quotient are acute. The urgency (to put it that way) of the problem for the geometers accounts for the title of the 1959 [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]] seminar ''TDTE'' on ''theorems of descent and techniques of existence'' (see [[Fondements de la Géometrie Algébrique|FGA]]) connecting the descent question with the [[representable functor]] question in algebraic geometry in general, and the [[moduli problem]] in particular.

== Fully faithful descent ==
Let &lt;math&gt;p:X' \to X&lt;/math&gt;. Each sheaf ''F'' on ''X'' gives rise to a descent data:
:&lt;math&gt;(F' = p^* F, \alpha: p_0^* F' \simeq p_1^* F'), \, p_i: X'' = X' \times_X X' \to X'&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the cocycle condition:
:&lt;math&gt;p_{02}^* \alpha = p_{12}^* \alpha \circ p_{01}^* \alpha, \, p_{ij}: X'' \times_{X'} X'' \times_{X'} X'' \to X'' \times_{X'} X''&lt;/math&gt;.

The fully faithful descent says: &lt;math&gt;F \mapsto (F', \alpha)&lt;/math&gt; is fully faithful. The descent theory tells conditions for which there is a fully faithful descent.

In [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch politics]] the term '''dualism''' is used to refer to the [[separation of powers]] between the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|cabinet]] and [[States-General of the Netherlands|parliament]]. In this respect, the way the Dutch cabinets function is somewhat [[Semi-presidential_system|semi-presidential]] in its system of government, not [[Parliamentary_system|parliamentary]]. Unlike the presidential system, the legislative branch consists of the cabinet together with the parliament and cabinets are formed on basis of a majority in parliament. Unlike the [[Westminster system|Westminster parliamentary system]], cabinet ministers cannot be members of parliament. An important political issue is whether ministers and leaders of governing parliamentary parties should prepare important political decisions. According to the dualistic position, members of parliament of governing parties should function independently of their cabinet. The term '''monism''' is used to refer to a stance that important decisions should be prepared by the members of the governing coalition in order to promote political stability.

In the context of the history of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], "dualism" refers to the political doctrine of [[Austria]]'s and [[Hungary]]'s [[Imperial and Royal|co-equality]]. The phrase "during dualism" ({{lang-hu|dualizmus alatt}}) is used in Hungarian historiography as shorthand for "during the dual monarchy."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9250">'''Earning to give''' involves deliberately pursuing a high-earning career for the purpose of donating a significant portion of earned income, typically because of a belief in [[effective altruism]].

Advocates of earning to give sometimes suggest that maximizing the amount one can donate to charity is an important consideration for individuals when deciding what career to pursue, even if the individual has less [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] interest in high-earning careers.&lt;ref name=kristof&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-the-trader-who-donates-half-his-pay.html?_r=0|title = The Trader Who Donates Half His Pay|last= Kristof|first = Nicholas|authorlink = Nicholas Kristof|date = April 4, 2015|accessdate = April 10, 2015|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proponents==
In the 1996 book ''[[Living High and Letting Die]]'', the philosopher [[Peter Unger]] wrote that it was morally praiseworthy and perhaps even morally required for people in academia who could earn substantially greater salaries in the business world to leave academia, earn the greater salaries, and donate most of the extra money to charity.&lt;ref name="Unger"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Unger|first1=Peter|title=Living High and Letting Die|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198026811}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]] has laid the foundations for effective altruism and earning to give in his 1971 essay "[[Famine, Affluence, and Morality|''Famine, Affluence and Morality'']]" and since advocated for donating considerable amounts of one's income to effective charitable organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-singer-on-the-ethics-of-philanthropy-1428083293|title=Peter Singer on the Ethics of Philanthropy|last=Wolfe|first=Alexandra|date=2015-04-03|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-04-04|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer is a public proponent of effective altruism and endorsed earning to give in his 2013 [[TED talk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Singer|first=Peter|title=The why and how of effective altruism|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism|language=en|accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associate Professor in Philosophy at Oxford University [[William MacAskill]] promoted earning to give as one possible high impact career in several news articles and in his 2015 book [[Doing Good Better|''Doing Good Better: Effective Altruism and a Radical New Way to Make a Difference'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/57254/to-save-the-world-dont-get-a-job-at-a-charity-go-work-on-wall-street/|title=To save the world, don’t get a job at a charity; go work on Wall Street|work=Quartz|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2015/09/10/working-for-a-hedge-fund-could-be-the-most-charitable-thing-you-do/|title=Working for a hedge fund could be the most charitable thing you do|last=MacAskill|first=William|date=2015-09-10|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-04-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=MacAskill|first2=William|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacAskill is the co-founder and president of [[80,000 Hours]], a nonprofit which conducts research on careers with positive social impact and provides career advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/about/meet-the-team/|title=Meet the team - 80,000 Hours|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization recommends earning to give as a career path with a high impact potential for effective altruists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/articles/earning-to-give/|title=Why and how to earn to give - 80,000 Hours|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/31/join-wall-street-save-the-world/|title=Join Wall Street.

==Debate==
[[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] criticized the concept in his ''[[New York Times]]'' opinion column,&lt;ref name=brooks&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html?ref=opinion|title = The Way to Produce a Person|last = Brooks|first = David|date = 2013-06-03|accessdate = 2013-10-16|publisher = ''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that, while altruists may start doing "earning to give" to realize their deepest commitments, their values may erode over time, becoming progressively less altruistic. In addition, Brooks objected to the view on which altruists should turn themselves "into a machine for the redistribution of wealth." [[Peter Singer]] responded to these criticisms in his book ''The Most Good You Can Do'' by giving examples of people who have been earning to give for years without losing their altruistic motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.yupnet.org/2016/08/09/earning-to-give-leads-to-happiness/|title='Earning to Give' Leads to Happiness|date=2016-08-09|website=Yale Press Log|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; William MacAskill also defended the practice against Brooks' criticisms in ''[[The Washington Post]],'' arguing that even [[Friedrich Engels]] was earning to give to support the work of anti-capitalist [[Karl Marx]] financially.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Dana Goldstein]] has also criticized earning to give, prompting a response from [[Reihan Salam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/349841/rise-singerians-reihan-salam|title = The Rise of the Singerians|last = Salam|first = Reihan|date = May 31, 2013|accessdate = November 26, 2013|publisher = ''[[National Review]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12904">In [[financial mathematics]] and [[stochastic optimization]], the concept of [[risk measure]] is used to quantify the risk involved in a random outcome or risk position. Many risk measures have hitherto been proposed, each having certain characteristics. The '''entropic value-at-risk''' ('''EVaR''') is a [[coherent risk measure]] introduced by Ahmadi-Javid,&lt;ref name=Ahmadi1&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmadi-Javid|first=Amir|title=An information-theoretic approach to constructing coherent risk measures|year=2011|publisher=Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory|location=St. Petersburg, Russia|pages=2125–2127|doi= 10.1109/ISIT.2011.6033932}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ahmadi2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmadi-Javid|first=Amir|title=Entropic value-at-risk: A new coherent risk measure|journal=Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications|year=2012|volume=155|pages=1105–1123|doi=10.1007/s10957-011-9968-2|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an upper bound for the [[value at risk]] (VaR) and the [[conditional value-at-risk]] (CVaR), obtained from the [[Chernoff inequality]]. The EVaR can also be represented by using the concept of [[relative entropy]]. Because of its connection with the VaR and the relative entropy, this risk measure is called "entropic value-at-risk". The EVaR was developed to tackle some computational inefficiencies{{clarify|reason=What inefficiencies?|date=February 2013}} of the CVaR. Getting inspiration from the dual representation of the EVaR, Ahmadi-Javid&lt;ref name="Ahmadi1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahmadi2" /&gt; developed a wide class of [[coherent risk measure]]s, called '''[[g-entropic risk measure]]s'''. Both the CVaR and the EVaR are members of this class.

== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[probability space]] with &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; a set of all simple events, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; a &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra of subsets of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; a [[probability measure]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[random variable]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_{M^+}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all [[Borel measurable]] functions &lt;math&gt;X:\Omega\to\R&lt;/math&gt; whose [[moment-generating function]] &lt;math&gt;M_X(z)&lt;/math&gt; exists for all &lt;math&gt;z\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;. The entropic value-at-risk (EVaR) of &lt;math&gt;X\in \mathbf{L}_{M^+}&lt;/math&gt; with confidence level &lt;math&gt;1-\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X):=\inf_{z&gt;0} \left \{z^{-1}\ln \left (\frac{M_X(z)}{\alpha} \right ) \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

In finance, the [[random variable]] &lt;math&gt;X \in \mathbf{L}_{M^+},&lt;/math&gt; in the above equation, is used to model the ''losses'' of a portfolio.

Consider the Chernoff inequality

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Pr(X\geq a)\leq e^{-za}M_X(z),\quad \forall z&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Solving the equation &lt;math&gt; e^{-za}M_X(z)=\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;a,&lt;/math&gt; results in 

:&lt;math&gt;a_X(\alpha,z):=z^{-1}\ln \left (\frac{M_X(z)}{\alpha} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

By considering the equation ({{EquationNote|1}}), we see that 

:&lt;math&gt;\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X):=\inf_{z&gt;0}\{a_X(\alpha,z)\},&lt;/math&gt;

which shows the relationship between the EVaR and the Chernoff inequality. It is worth noting that &lt;math&gt;a_X(1,z)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''[[entropic risk measure]]'' or ''[[exponential premium]]'', which is a concept used in finance and insurance, respectively.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_{M}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all Borel measurable functions &lt;math&gt;X:\Omega\to \R&lt;/math&gt; whose moment-generating function &lt;math&gt;M_X(z)&lt;/math&gt; exists for all &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. The [[dual representation]] (or robust representation) of the EVaR is as follows:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X)=\sup_{Q\in \Im}(E_Q(X)),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;X\in \mathbf{L}_{M},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Im&lt;/math&gt; is a set of probability measures on &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\Im=\{Q\ll P:D_{KL}(Q||P)\leq-\ln\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that 

:&lt;math&gt;D_{KL}(Q||P):=\int\frac{dQ}{dP}\left (\ln\frac{dQ}{dP} \right )dP&lt;/math&gt; 

is the [[relative entropy]] of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;P,&lt;/math&gt; also called the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]]. The dual representation of the EVaR discloses the reason behind its naming.

==Properties==
* The EVaR is a coherent risk measure.

* The moment-generating function &lt;math&gt;M_X(z)&lt;/math&gt; can be represented by the EVaR: for all &lt;math&gt;X\in \mathbf{L}_{M^+}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;M_X(z)=\sup_{0&lt;\alpha\leq 1}\{\alpha\exp(z\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X))\}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

* For &lt;math&gt;X,Y\in\mathbf{L}_M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X)=\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(Y)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in]0,1]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;F_X(b)=F_Y(b)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;b\in\R&lt;/math&gt;.

* The entropic risk measure with parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta,&lt;/math&gt; can be represented by means of the EVaR: for all &lt;math&gt;X\in \mathbf{L}_{M^+}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;\theta^{-1}\ln M_X(\theta)=a_X(1,\theta)=\sup_{0&lt;\alpha\leq 1}\{\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X)+\theta^{-1}\ln\alpha\}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

* The EVaR with confidence level &lt;math&gt;1-\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the tightest possible upper bound that can be obtained from the Chernoff inequality for the VaR and the CVaR with confidence level &lt;math&gt;1 - \alpha&lt;/math&gt;;
{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;\text{VaR}(X)\leq \text{CVaR}(X)\leq\text{EVaR}(X).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

* The following inequality holds for the EVaR: 
{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;\text{E}(X)\leq\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X)\leq\text{esssup}(X)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}
:where &lt;math&gt;\text{E}(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[expected value]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{esssup}(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[essential supremum]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\inf_{t\in\R}\{t:\Pr(X\leq t)=1\}&lt;/math&gt;. So do hold &lt;math&gt;\text{EVaR}_0(X)=\text{E}(X)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\alpha\to 0}\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X)=\text{esssup}(X)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==

[[File:Comparing the VaR, CVaR and EVaR for the uniform distribution.png|thumbnail|right|Comparing the VaR, CVaR and EVaR for the uniform distribution over the interval (0,1)]]
For &lt;math&gt;X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2),&lt;/math&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X)=\mu+\sigma\sqrt{-2\ln\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}

For &lt;math&gt;X\sim U(a,b),&lt;/math&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\text{EVaR}_{1-\alpha}(X)=\inf_{t&gt;0}\left\lbrace t\ln\left(t\frac{e^{t^{-1}b}-e^{t^{-1}a}}{b-a}\right)-t\ln\alpha \right\rbrace.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}

Figures 1 and 2 show the comparing of the VaR, CVaR and EVaR for &lt;math&gt;N(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U(0,1)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Optimization==
Let &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; be a risk measure. Consider the optimization problem

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\min_{\boldsymbol{w}\in \boldsymbol{W}}\rho(G(\boldsymbol{w},\boldsymbol{\psi})),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{w}\in\boldsymbol{W}\subseteq\R^n&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional real [[decision vector]], &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\psi}&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional real [[random vector]] with a known [[probability distribution]] and the function &lt;math&gt;G(\boldsymbol{w},.) :\R^m\to\R&lt;/math&gt; is a Borel measurable function for all values &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{w}\in\boldsymbol{W}.&lt;/math&gt; If &lt;math&gt;\rho=\text{EVaR},&lt;/math&gt; then the optimization problem ({{EquationNote|10}}) turns into:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\min_{\boldsymbol{w}\in\boldsymbol{W}, t&gt;0} \left \{t\ln M_{G(\boldsymbol{w},\boldsymbol{\psi})}(t^{-1})-t\ln\alpha \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|11}}}}

Let &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{S}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[support of the random vector]] &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\psi}.&lt;/math&gt; If &lt;math&gt;G(.,\boldsymbol{s})&lt;/math&gt; is [[convex function|convex]] for all &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s}\in\boldsymbol{S}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}}&lt;/math&gt;, then the objective function of the problem ({{EquationNote|11}}) is also convex. If &lt;math&gt;G(\boldsymbol{w},\boldsymbol{\psi})&lt;/math&gt; has the form

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;G(\boldsymbol{w},\boldsymbol{\psi})=g_0(\boldsymbol{w})+\sum_{i=1}^mg_i(\boldsymbol{w})\psi_i,\qquad g_i:\R^n\to\R, i=0,1,\ldots,m,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|12}}}}

and &lt;math&gt;\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_m&lt;/math&gt; are [[independent random variables]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_M&lt;/math&gt;, then ({{EquationNote|11}}) becomes

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\min_{\boldsymbol{w}\in\boldsymbol{W}, t&gt;0}\left\lbrace g_0(\boldsymbol{w})+t\sum_{i=1}^m\ln M_{g_i(\boldsymbol{w})\psi_i}(t^{-1})-t \ln \alpha \right\rbrace.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|13}}}}

which is computationally [[tractable problem|tractable]]. But for this case, if one uses the CVaR in problem ({{EquationNote|10}}), then the resulting problem becomes as follows:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\min_{\boldsymbol{w}\in\boldsymbol{W}, t\in\R}\left\lbrace t+\frac{1}{\alpha}\text{E}\left[ g_0(\boldsymbol{w})+ \sum_{i=1}^{m} g_i(\boldsymbol{w}) \psi_i-t \right]_+ \right\rbrace.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|14}}}}

It can be shown that by increasing the dimension of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, problem ({{EquationNote|14}}) is computationally intractable even for simple cases. For example, assume that &lt;math&gt;\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_m&lt;/math&gt; are independent [[discrete random variable]]s that take &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; distinct values. For fixed values of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{w}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t,&lt;/math&gt; the [[complexity]] of computing the objective function given in problem ({{EquationNote|13}}) is of order &lt;math&gt;mk&lt;/math&gt; while the computing time for the objective function of problem ({{EquationNote|14}}) is of order &lt;math&gt;k^m&lt;/math&gt;. For illustration, assume that &lt;math&gt;k=2, m=100&lt;/math&gt; and the summation of two numbers takes &lt;math&gt;10^{-12}&lt;/math&gt; seconds. For computing the objective function of problem ({{EquationNote|14}}) one needs about &lt;math&gt;4\times 10^{10}&lt;/math&gt; years, whereas the evaluation of objective function of problem ({{EquationNote|13}}) takes about &lt;math&gt;10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt; seconds. This shows that formulation with the EVaR outperforms the formulation with the CVaR (see &lt;ref name=Ahmadi2/&gt; for more details).

==Generalization (g-entropic risk measures)==
Drawing inspiration from the dual representation of the EVaR given in ({{EquationNote|3}}), one can define a wide class of information-theoretic coherent risk measures, which are introduced in.&lt;ref name=Ahmadi1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ahmadi2/&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; be a convex [[proper function]] with &lt;math&gt;g(1)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; be a non-negative number. The &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;-entropic risk measure with divergence level &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\text{ER}_{g,\beta}(X):=\sup_{Q\in\Im}\text{E}_Q(X)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|15}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\Im=\{Q\ll P:H_g(P,Q)\leq\beta\}&lt;/math&gt; in which &lt;math&gt;H_g(P,Q)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[generalized relative entropy]] of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. A primal representation of the class of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;-entropic risk measures can be obtained as follows:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\text{ER}_{g,\beta}(X)=\inf_{t&gt;0,\mu\in\R}\left\lbrace t\left[ \mu+\text{E}_P\left( g^*\left( \frac{X}{t}-\mu+\beta \right) \right) \right] \right\rbrace&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|16}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;g^*&lt;/math&gt; is the conjugate of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. By considering

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g(x)=\begin{cases} x\ln x &amp; x&gt;0 \\ 0 &amp; x=0 \\ +\infty &amp; x&lt;0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|17}}}}

with &lt;math&gt;g^*(x)=e^{x-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta=- \ln\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the EVaR formula can be deduced. The CVaR is also a &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;-entropic risk measure, which can be obtained from ({{EquationNote|16}}) by setting

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g(x)= \begin{cases} 0 &amp; 0\leq x\leq \frac{1}{\alpha} \\ +\infty &amp; \text{otherwise}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|18}}}}

with &lt;math&gt;g^*(x)=\tfrac{1}{\alpha}\max\{0,x\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta=0&lt;/math&gt; (see &lt;ref name=Ahmadi1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ahmadi3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmadi-Javid|first=Amir|title=Addendum to: Entropic Value-at-Risk: A New Coherent Risk Measure|journal=Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications|year=2012|volume=155|pages=1124–1128|doi=10.1007/s10957-012-0014-9|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; for more details).

'''Ernst Roets''' is a political activist, writer and filmmaker in [[South Africa]]. He is Deputy CEO of the civil rights organisation [[AfriForum]] and the CEO of the film production company Forum Films.

== Education ==
Roets grew up in the agricultural town of Tzaneen where he matriculated in 2003 from the Merensky High School. He obtained his LLB degree in 2009 from the [[University of Pretoria|University of Pretoria (UP)]]. During his student years he served in various leadership structures, including the Student Representative Council (SRC) and the Senate, at this university.

During his student years Roets served as founding member and the first National Chairperson of Solidarity Youth. In 2008 Solidarity Youth changed its name and the organisation was converted to AfriForum Youth. In 2016, Roets obtained his LLM degree in Public Law with distinction from the [[University of Pretoria|UP]]. The title of his dissertation was ''’n Peiling van die middele kragtens die Suid-Afrikaanse Grondwet, ter afdwinging van die basiese regte van minderheidsgemeenskappe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roets|first=Ernst|date=2016|title='n Peiling van die middele kragtens die Suid-Afrikaanse Grondwet, ter afdwinging van die basiese regte van minderheidsgemeenskappe|url=https://repository.up.ac.za/handle/2263/53186|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Roets was arrested in 2010 after he attempted to install a billboard with the words “Welcome to Pretoria” next to the N1 highway. This action was in protest against the [[City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality|Tshwane Metropolitan]] Municipality’s use of the word “Tshwane” to refer to the capital during the 2010 Fifa Soccer World Cup, while the city’s name is in fact [[Pretoria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/3-held-for-violating-ad-by-law-20100709|title=3 held for violating ad by-law|last=|first=|date=2010-07-09|website=News24|archive-url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/3-held-for-violating-ad-by-law-20100709|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2011 Roets was appointed as Deputy CEO of AfriForum. He testified on behalf of [[AfriForum]] in 2011 in the case of AfriForum vs. [[Julius Malema|Malema]]. On behalf of AfriForum he submitted a charge of hate speech against Julius Malema after Malema sang the song “Dubula I’Bhunu” (Shoot the Boer) at various political gatherings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/Archives/City-Press/Afriforum-takes-Malema-to-Equality-Court-20150430|title=Afriforum takes Malema to Equality Court|last=|first=|date=11 March 2010|work=News24|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The court found Malema guilty of hate speech&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAEQC/2011/2.html|title=Afri-Forum and Another v Malema and Others (20968/2010) [2011] ZAEQC 2; 2011 (6) SA 240 (EqC); [2011] 4 All SA 293 (EqC); 2011 (12) BCLR 1289 (EqC) (12 September 2011)|last=|first=|date=12 September 2011|website=South Africa: Equality Court|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Roets addressed various conferences of the United Nations (UN), especially on farm murders and the state of minority rights in South Africa. In 2015, at the UN’s offices in Genève, he reacted sharply to an accusation by the South African government that those who are asking for the prioritisation of farm murders only did so because they were steering a racial agenda and wanted to bring back apartheid&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=AfriForum|title=AfriForum kap regering by VN|date=2015-11-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5oFBek4e2E|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the same year Roets submitted a complaint of discrimination against the South African government with the UN’s Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders after the South African government politically interfered at the UN to prevent AfriForum from registering as a non-government organisation at the UN&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politicsweb.co.za/politics/dirco-guns-for-afriforum-at-un--ernst-roets|title=DIRCO guns for AfriForum at UN - Ernst Roets - POLITICS {{!}} Politicsweb|website=politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Farm murders ==
Since 2012 Roets has led AfriForum's campaign to raise awareness about farm attacks.

=== Tainted Heroes ===
Tainted Heroes is a [[South Africa|South African]] documentary film that was produced by Forum Films under direction of Elrich Yssel, with Roets and Beatrice Pretorius as producers. The film is about the violent battle of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) against [[apartheid]] in South Africa between 1976 and 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://taintedheroes.co.za/|title=Tainted Heroes|website=taintedheroes.co.za|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The documentary is based on the book ''People’s War: New Light on the Struggle for [[South Africa]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://irr.org.za/reports/books/copy_of_peoples-war-new-light-on-the-struggle-for-south-africa|title=People's War: New Light on the Struggle for South Africa|last=Jonathan|first=Ball|date=|website=SAIRR (South African Institute of Race Relations)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Anthea Jeffery. 

Max du Preez described the film as “crude” and “reckless”, but afterwards admitted that he hasn’t seen the film yet. The journalist Pieter du Toit said that Roets played with fire. Even though the ANC did not want to comment on the contents of the film, the party characterised it as propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/anc-scoffs-at-propaganda-film-claims-1980960|title=ANC scoffs at ‘propaganda’ film claims {{!}} IOL News|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Kill the Boer (book) ===
Roets is the author of the book ''Kill the Boer'' that was published in June 2018. ''Kill the Boer'' is about farm attacks in [[South Africa]]. In the book Roets argues that the South African government, due to a number of reasons, is complicit in the attacks.&lt;ref name="Hlatshaneni"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hlatshaneni |first1=Simnikiwe |title=Outrage surrounds book claiming top ANC officials ‘killed the boer’ |url=https://citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/1964479/outrage-surrounds-book-claiming-top-anc-officials-killed-the-boer/ |accessdate=24 November 2018 |publisher=The Citizen |date=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He characterises the events as [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.killtheboerbook.com|title=Home - Kill the Boer Book|website=Kill the Boer Book|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roets argues that in 2017 [[South African farm attacks]] took place at an unusual frequency" and that the killings "were unusually cruel."&lt;ref name="JordaanAttacks"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jordaan |first1=Nomahlubi |title=AfriForum concerned about 'sharp' increase in farm attacks |url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2018-06-28-afriforum-concerned-about-sharp-increase-in-farm-attacks/ |accessdate=25 November 2018 |publisher=[[The Times (South Africa)]] |date=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In engineering, '''hardware architecture''' refers to the identification of a system's physical components and their interrelationships. This description, often called a '''hardware design model''', allows hardware designers to understand how their components fit into a system architecture and provides to software component designers important information needed for software development and integration. Clear definition of a hardware architecture allows the various traditional engineering disciplines (e.g., electrical and mechanical engineering) to work more effectively together to develop and manufacture new machines, devices and components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rai, L.  |author2=Kang, S.J. |title=Rule-based modular software and hardware architecture for multi-shaped robots using real-time dynamic behavior identification and selection |journal=Knowledge-Based Systems |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=273–283 |year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.knosys.2007.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hardware'' is also an expression used within the computer engineering industry to explicitly distinguish the ([[electronic computer]]) hardware from the ''software'' that runs on it.  But ''hardware,'' within the [[automation]] and [[software engineering]] disciplines, need not simply be a computer of some sort.  A modern automobile runs vastly more ''software'' than the Apollo spacecraft. Also, modern aircraft cannot function without running tens of millions of computer instructions embedded and distributed throughout the aircraft and resident in both standard computer hardware and in specialized hardward components such as IC wired logic gates, analog and hybrid devices, and other digital components. The need to effectively model how separate physical components combine to form complex systems is important over a wide range of applications, including computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, surgical instrumentation, satellites, and submarines.

Hardware architecture is the representation of an engineered (or ''to be engineered'') electronic or electromechanical hardware system, and the process and discipline for effectively implementing the [[design]](s) for such a system.  It is generally part of a larger integrated system encompassing [[information]], [[software]], and device [[prototyping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frampton, K.D., Martin, S.E. &amp; Minor, K. |title=The scaling of acoustic streaming for application in micro-fluidic devices |journal=Applied Acoustics |volume=64 |issue=7 |pages=681–692 |year=2003|doi=10.1016/S0003-682X(03)00005-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a ''representation'' because it is used to convey information about the related [[wiktionary:element|elements]] comprising a hardware system, the relationships among those elements, and the [[wiktionary:rule|rules]] governing those relationships.

It is a ''process'' because a sequence of steps is prescribed to produce or change the architecture, and/or a design from that architecture, of a hardware system within a set of constraints.

It is a ''discipline'' because a body of knowledge is used to inform practitioners as to the most effective way to design the system within a set of constraints.

A hardware architecture is primarily concerned with the internal electrical (and, more rarely, the [[Electromechanics|mechanical]]) [[Electrical connector|interface]]s among the system's [[software componentry|components]] or [[system|subsystem]]s, and the [[computer bus|interface]]  between the system and its external environment, especially the devices operated by or the electronic displays viewed by a [[User (computing)|user]].  (This latter, special interface, is known as the [[computer human interface]], ''AKA'' human computer interface, or [[Human-computer interaction|HCI]]; formerly called the man-machine interface.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brunelli, C., Garzia, F. &amp; Nurmi, J. |title=A coarse-grain reconfigurable architecture for multimedia applications featuring subword computation capabilities |journal=Journal of Real-Time Image Processing |volume=3 |issue=1–2 |pages=21–32 |year=2008|doi=10.1007/s11554-008-0071-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated circuit (IC) designers are driving current technologies into innovative approaches for new products.

Prior to the advent of digital computers, the electronics and other engineering disciplines used the terms system and hardware as they are still commonly used today.  However, with the arrival of digital computers on the scene and the development of software engineering as a separate discipline, it was often necessary to distinguish among engineered ''hardware'' artifacts, ''software'' artifacts, and the combined artifacts.  

A [[Computer program|programmable]] hardware artifact, or machine, that lacks its computer program is impotent; even as a software artifact, or program, is equally impotent unless it can be used to alter the sequential states of a suitable (hardware) machine.  However, a hardware machine and its programming can be designed to perform an almost illimitable number of abstract and physical tasks.  Within the computer and software engineering disciplines (and, often, other engineering disciplines, such as communications), then, the terms hardware, software, and system came to distinguish between the hardware that runs a [[computer program]], the software, and the hardware device complete with its program.

The ''hardware'' engineer or architect deals (more or less) exclusively with the hardware device; the ''software'' engineer or architect deals (more or less) exclusively with the program; and the ''systems'' engineer or [[systems architect]] is responsible for seeing that the programming is capable of properly running within the hardware device, and that the system composed of the two entities is capable of properly interacting with its external environment, especially the user, and performing its intended function.

A hardware architecture, then, is an abstract representation of an electronic or an electromechanical device capable of running a fixed or changeable program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Assif, D., Himel, R. &amp; Grajower, Y. |title=A new electromechanical device to measure the accuracy of interocclusal records |journal=Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=672–676 |year=1988|pmid=3165452 |doi=10.1016/0022-3913(88)90380-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zimmermann, M., Volden, T., Kirstein, K.-U., Hafizovic, S., Lichtenberg, J., Brand, O. &amp; Hierlemann, A. |title=A CMOS-based integrated-system architecture for a static cantilever array |journal=Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical |volume=131 |issue=1 |pages=254–264 |year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.snb.2007.11.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hardware architecture generally includes some form of analog, digital, or hybrid electronic computer, along with electronic and mechanical sensors and actuators. Hardware design may be viewed as a 'partitioning [[Scheme (mathematics)|scheme]],' or [[algorithm]], which considers all of the system's present and foreseeable requirements and arranges the necessary hardware components into a workable set of cleanly [[wikt:bounded|bounded]] [[subsystem]]s with no more parts than are required.  That is, it is a partitioning scheme that is exclusive, inclusive, and [[Collectively exhaustive events|exhaustive]].  A major purpose of the partitioning is to arrange the elements in the hardware subsystems so that there is a minimum of electrical connections and electronic communications needed among them.  In both software and hardware, a good subsystem tends to be seen as a meaningful "[[object (computer science)|object]]."  Moreover, a clear allocation of user requirements to the architecture (hardware and software) provides an effective basis for [[Verification and Validation|validation tests]] of the user's requirements in the as-built system.

Developed by [[Northrop Grumman]], the '''Integrated Meteorological System''' (AN/TMQ-40 '''IMETS)''' is the meteorological component of the Intelligence and Electronic Warfare (IEW) an element of the Army Battle Command System (ABCS). IMETS provides Army commanders at all echelons with an automated weather system to receive, process, and disseminate weather observations, forecasts, and weather and environmental effects decision aids to all Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS). IMETS is a mobile, tactical, automated weather data receiving, processing and dissemination system. The IMETS is an Army-furnished and maintained system operated by US Air Force battlefield weather team personnel. It uses US Air Force and Army developed software to provide a total weather system to support the Army. The [[Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid]] (IWEDA) software, originally developed by the [[U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] (ARL) in 1992, has been fielded on IMETS since 1997 to provide tactical weather support to the U.S. Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Szymber |first1=Richard J . |title=Quantitative Weather Impacts: An Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid Impact Magnitude Gradation Scheme and Friendly Versus Threat Delta Advantage |url=https://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2013/ARL-TR-6539.pdf |website=www.arl.army.mil/ |publisher=Army Research Laboratory |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IMETS is a heavy [[Humvee]] mounted tactical system which provides automation and communications support to staff weather teams assigned to echelons from brigade through Echelons Above Corps (EAC). IMETS receives weather information from polar-orbiting civilian and defense meteorological satellites, Air Force Global Weather Center, artillery meteorological teams, remote sensors and civilian forecast centers. IMETS processes and collates forecasts, observations, and climatological data to produce timely and accurate weather products tailored to the specific Warfighter’s needs.

IMETS provides automation and communications support to USAF Weather Teams assigned to Army G2/G3 sections at echelons Brigade through EAC. IMETS receives, processes, and collates forecasts, observations, and climatological data to produce weather forecasts and timely and accurate products to meet Commanders' requirements. IMETS produces displays and disseminates, over Army ABCS, weather forecasts and tactical decision aids that compare the impact of current, projected, or hypothesized weather conditions on friendly and enemy capabilities.

==Variations==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:IMETS-Light.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''IMETS Light'']] --&gt;
The IMETS currently fielded is in two configurations. They are the vehicle-mounted configuration (VMC), IMETS-Heavy, and the laptop version, the IMETS-Light. The IMETS-Light is the most common version; US Army uses IMETS-Light for aviation brigades and brigade combat teams.  Both configurations have identical intelligence processing capabilities. The IMETS-Light has recently passed the Milestone C review and its production and fielding have official authorization. Both configurations of IMETS operate with ABCS Version 6.X-complaint software.

==Training==
IMETS training is accomplished at Staff Weather Officer (SWO) Course at [[Fort Huachuca]], Arizona. SWO training is four weeks long, IMETS portion being half of that.  This is somewhat ironic, as IMETS has not been used much since the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq began.

==My Weather Impacts Decision Aid==
As of 2018, '''My Weather Impacts Decision Aid (MyWIDA)''', a [[Decision support software|decision-support software]], was developed by the [[U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] (ARL).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=1416|title=MyWIDA helps solve complexities of battlespace weather|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0ouDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT151&amp;lpg=PT151&amp;dq=mywida+army&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xP7brmz4ta&amp;sig=j5Q2zAR69eCrdVKcUB0Zrd6MBq8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjpy-Hf5Y3dAhWHt1MKHeAjC4c4ChDoATADegQIBxAB#v=onepage&amp;q=mywida%20army&amp;f=false|title=Military Quantitative Physiology: Problems and Concepts in Military Operational Medicine: Problems and Concepts in Military Operational Medicine|last=Institute|first=Borden|last2=General|first2=Office of the Surgeon|last3=Lenhart|first3=Martha K.|date=2017-07-26|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=9780160939112|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed to improve compatibility of technology with environmental factors through weather forecasting, MyWIDA is an updated version of the Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid (IWEDA), which the Army fielded in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8wIcWpgq4wC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=mywida&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MARFPd5Ttn&amp;sig=h1Kco1yPnypSij5YYuifpftdFf0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqjJDIhYjcAhUEu1MKHVspCko4ChDoAQhEMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=mywida&amp;f=false|title=History of U.S. Army Research Laboratory|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MyWIDA uses weather forecast data to evaluate environmental impacts on military technology, aiding decision-makers in selecting appropriate technological tools under forecasted weather events.  An example is surface winds greater than 25 knots, which prohibit launching of [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] (UAVs) in a military scenario. The user would be alerted of this physical limitation through the MyWIDA software.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The system includes red-amber-green ratings (unfavorable-marginal-favorable), which account for a combination of weather parameters that affect a system or technology. These ratings determine limits beyond which it is not feasible for the technology function due to safety considerations, decreased system effectiveness or violation of manufacturer's operating limits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

MyWida was preceded by Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid (IWEDA), an automated software decision aid developed by ARL in 1992.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2011/ARL-TR-5570.pdf|title=An Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid Parameter Weighting Scheme|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

IWEDA was fielded on the Integrated Meteorological System (IMETS) in 1997 to provide tactical weather support to the U.S. IWEDA software was certified and accredited for the Army in 2006. As of 2011, the web-based MYWIDA was under development for eventual replacement of IWEDA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

IWEDA was designed to address the adverse effects of the environment and climate (i.e. wind, precipitation, storms and temperature) on military operations and weapon systems. IWEDA produced a graphic display of weather impacts on 70 weapon systems, including 16 threat systems. Impacts were displayed graphically on a user interface, called the Weather Effects Matrix (WEM), which color coded the impacts on the system of interest (i.e. green “favorable,” amber “marginal,” and red “unfavorable”). Although intended for the Army, applications were also integrated into the Air Force and Navy systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.878.8661&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=The Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid: A Common Software Tool to Assist in Command and Control Decision Making|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, observations have identified varying needs for IWEDA’s improvement. These included (1) a need to derive complete mission impact due to poor weather conditions, rather than simply presenting a “worst-case scenario” for specific weapon systems; and (2) a need to improve representation of IWEDA’s “stoplight” color scheme (green, yellow and red) by providing more color-coded values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a588633.pdf|title=Quantitative Weather Impacts: An Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid Impact Magnitude Gradation Scheme and Friendly Versus Threat Delta Advantage|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Integrated threat theory''', also known as '''intergroup threat theory'''&lt;ref name='stephan2009'&gt;{{cite book |last=Stephan |first=Walter G. |last2=Ybarra |first2=Oscar |last3=Morrison |first3=Kimberly Rios |editor-last=Nelson |editor-first=Todd D. |title=Handbook of Prejudice, Stereotyping, and Discrimination |publisher=Psychology Press. Taylor and Francis Group| date=2009 |pages=44 |chapter=Intergroup Threat Theory}}
&lt;/ref&gt; is a theory in [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] which attempts to describe the components of perceived threat that lead to prejudice between [[social group]]s. The theory applies to any social group that may feel threatened in some way, whether or not that social group is a majority or minority group in their society. This theory deals with perceived threat rather than actual threat. Perceived threat includes all of the threats that members of group believe they are experiencing, regardless of whether those threats actually exist. For example, people may feel their economic well-being is threatened by an [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]] stealing their jobs even if, in reality, the outgroup has no effect on their job opportunities. Still, their perception that their job security is under threat can increase their levels of prejudice against the outgroup. Thus, even [[false alarm]]s about threat still have “real consequence” for prejudice between groups.&lt;ref name='stephan2009'/&gt;

==Original components of the theory==
Integrated Threat Theory was first proposed by Walter G. Stephan and Cookie White Stephan (2000).&lt;ref name="ZZ"&gt;Stephan, W. G.; Stephan, C. W. (2000). An integrated threat theory of prejudice. In Oskamp, S. (Ed.) Reducing Prejudice and Discrimination (pp. 23–45). Mahwah, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; The original theory had four components: realistic threats, symbolic threats, [[intergroup anxiety]], and negative [[stereotypes]].&lt;ref name="ZZ"/&gt; 

===Realistic threats===

Realistic threats are threats that pose a danger to the in-group’s well-being. These can include threats to physical safety or health, threats to economic and political power, and threats to the existence of the group. This component was originally developed as a part of [[realistic conflict theory]] by Donald T. Campbell (1965).&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D.T. (1965). Ethnocentric and Other Altruistic Motives. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press. pp. 283–311.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Symbolic threats===

Symbolic threats arise where there is a perceived difference between the values and worldview of an [[ingroup and outgroup]]. The difference can make the ingroup feel that the outgroup poses a threat to their group morals, standards, beliefs, and attitudes. These threats are thus strongly tied to a group’s sense of identity. The category was derived from [[Gordon Allport]]’s discussion of the relationship between one’s values and one’s identity. He proposed that, since values are important to who we are, we will reject other groups that disagree with our values.&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G.W. (1954) The nature of prejudice. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also based on the research of Esses and colleagues (1993), who found that groups had more negative feelings towards an outgroup if that outgroup interfered with the in-group’s customs.&lt;ref&gt;Esses V., Haddock G., and Zanna M. (1993) Values, stereotypes, and emotions as determinants of intergroup attitudes. In Mackie, D.M. &amp; Hamilton, D.L. (Eds.), Affect, cognition, and stereotyping - interactive processes in group perception (pp. 137-166) San Diego, CA: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intergroup anxiety===

Intergroup anxiety refers to the expectation that interacting with someone from a different group will be a negative experience. People with intergroup anxiety fear that they will feel uncomfortable, embarrassed, unsafe, or judged, either by members of the outgroup or by people of their own in-group. 
Before creating the Integrated Threat Theory framework, Stephan &amp; Stephan had been conducting research on intergroup anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, W.G. &amp; Stephan, C.W. (1985) Intergroup Anxiety. Journal of Social Issues, 41, 157-175. &lt;/ref&gt; The concept of intergroup anxiety also draws from Aversive Racism Theory, which argues that subconscious negative feelings about Black Americans are an important part of racism against them.&lt;ref&gt;Gaertner, S.L. &amp; Dovidio, J. F. (1986). "The aversive form of racism". In Gaertner, S.L. &amp; Dovidio, J. F. (Eds.), Prejudice, Discrimination and Racism (pp. 61–89). Orlando: Academic Press. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative stereotypes===

Stereotypes are a strategy of simplifying a complex situation by relying on popular pre-set judgements.&lt;ref name="WG"&gt;Stephan, W.G. &amp; Stephan, C.W. (1993) Cognition and affect in stereotyping : parallel interactive networks. In Mackie, D.M. &amp; Hamilton, D.L. (Eds.), Affect, cognition, and stereotyping - interactive processes in group perception (pp. 137-166). San Diego, CA: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated Threat Theory predicts that negative pre-set judgments about another group can lead to prejudice. 
This component of ITT draws from research that found that belief in negatively-rated stereotypical traits was linked to higher levels of prejudice against the stereotyped group.&lt;ref name="WG"/&gt; Stephan &amp; Stephan (2000) acknowledged that some research has not found links between prejudice and general stereotypes.&lt;ref name="ZZ"/&gt; Thus, it seems that, while general stereotypes assume some positive things about other groups, only the negative aspects of stereotypes are relevant to prejudice.


== Updated two-component theory ==

In 2002, Stephan and Renfro proposed an updated version of the theory which reduced the four components to two basic types: realistic and symbolic threats.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, W. G., &amp; Renfro, C. L. (2002). The role of threat in intergroup relations. In D. M. Mackie &amp; E. R. Smith (Eds.), From prejudice to inter-group emotions: Differentiated reactions to social groups (pp. 191–207). New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The categories of negative stereotypes and intergroup anxiety were removed from the basic framework of the theory because they were found to be better understood as subtypes of threat. They can lead to either realistic or symbolic threats rather than standing as their own separate categories.&lt;ref name='stephan2009'/&gt; For example, intergroup anxiety can be based on expectations of physical danger, a realistic threat, as well as on expectations of damage to one’s identity, a symbolic threat.&lt;ref name='stephan2009'/&gt; 

===Experimental Support===
Since ITT makes a causal claim that perceived threat causes prejudice, studies using an [[experimental design]] are necessary. Some researchers have taken on this task to experimentally manipulate types of realistic and perceived threat in order to examine if they cause prejudice. For example, Esses and colleagues (1998) and Esses and colleagues (2001) carried out research studies in which they manipulated the research participants’ understanding of economic threat posed by immigrants. Esses and colleagues (1998) had Canadian undergraduate student participants read one of two editorials that were written for the study. One editorial discussed a new group of immigrants with no mention of the job market while the other editorial discussed the same group and emphasized their success in finding jobs despite the scarcity of jobs in Canada. They then studied the effects of perception of economic threat, a type of realistic threat, on attitudes about immigrants and reported willingness to help immigrants. Results showed that participants that read the editorial that emphasized competition had less favorable attitudes towards immigrants and were less likely to approve of programs to empower immigrants &lt;ref name="Esses"&gt;Esses, V.M., Jackson, L.M., Armstrong, T.L. (1998). Intergroup competition and attitudes toward immigrants and immigration: An instrumental model. Journal of Social Issues, 54, 699-724.&lt;/ref&gt; Esses and colleagues (2001) carried out similar experiments with very similar editorials. Their results showed that participants that read articles that emphasized the tough job market had more negative attitudes towards the immigrants, were less supportive of their immigration into Canada, and were less supportive of programs to empower immigrants. &lt;ref name="VM"&gt;Esses, V.M., Dovidio, J.F., Jackson, L.M., Armstrong, T.L. (2001). The immigration dilemma: The role of perceived competition, ethnic prejudice, and national identity. Journal of Social Issues, 57, 389-412.&lt;/ref&gt; The data from these research studies provide some support for the causal influence of realistic threat on prejudice against immigrants.&lt;ref name="Esses"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VM"/&gt;

The causal influence of symbolic threat on prejudice was partially explored in a study by Branscombe &amp; Wann (1994), who focused on perceived threat to in-group identity in particular. The participants, undergraduate females from the U.S., answered questionnaires about their levels of pride in their American identity at the beginning of the study. They then  manipulated the participants’ perceived threat to in-group identity using video clips, which either showed an American or a Russian boxer beating the other in a match. After seeing one version of the video, participants completed a questionnaire that measured their desire to distance themselves from the outgroup, in this case, Russians. The results of this study showed that increased perception of threat to in-group identity raises a desire to distance oneself from the out-group. &lt;ref&gt;Branscome, N. &amp; Wann, D. (1994). Collective self esteem consequences of outgroup derogation when a valued social identity is on trial. European Journal of Social Psychology, 24, 641-657 &lt;/ref&gt; This provides some experimental evidence that perception of threat to in-group identity may causes greater prejudice towards out-groups. However, further experimental research is necessary in order to more firmly and widely establish the causal role of realistic and symbolic threats in prejudice. 

== Factors that influence levels of perceived threat ==
Several factors can lead to increased or decreased levels of group perceived threat.[such as?]

===Power Dynamics===
The updated ITT theory draws from the findings of [[contact hypothesis]], which claims that it is important to have equality between groups. Power dynamics between two groups are shown to have an influence on how the groups relate to and perceive each other. High-power groups are more likely to influence and threaten other groups. Low-power groups are often vulnerable to the influence and threats of other groups. Thus, low-power groups tend to be on alert and perceive more threats than high power groups do.&lt;ref&gt; Stephan, Walter G.; Ybarra, Oscar; Morrison, Kimberly Rios (2009). "Intergroup Threat Theory". In Nelson, Todd D. Handbook of Prejudice, Stereotyping, and Discrimination. Psychology Press. Taylor and Francis Group. p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Corenblum &amp; Stephan (2001) found, for example, that Native Canadians felt more threatened by White Canadians than White Canadians felt about them. &lt;ref&gt; Corenblum, B. &amp; Stephan, WG. (2001).  White fears and native apprehensions: An integrated threat theory approach to intergroup attitudes. ''Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science- Revue Canadienne des Sciences du Comportement, 33,'' 251-268.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when high-power groups do perceive threat from another group, they “will react more strongly” than low-power groups.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, Walter G.; Ybarra, Oscar; Morrison, Kimberly Rios (2009). "Intergroup Threat Theory". In Nelson, Todd D. Handbook of Prejudice, Stereotyping, and Discrimination. Psychology Press. Taylor and Francis Group. p. 44.
&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely because they have more to lose if the threat is real and have more resources that allow them to counter to such threats.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, Walter G.; Ybarra, Oscar; Morrison, Kimberly Rios (2009). "Intergroup Threat Theory". In Nelson, Todd D. Handbook of Prejudice, Stereotyping, and Discrimination. Psychology Press. Taylor and Francis Group. p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Two groups of relatively equal power status can be especially sensitive to feeling threatened if they are in competition with each other for resources, such as jobs. &lt;ref&gt;Garcia, S.M., Torr, A., Gonzales, R. (2006) Ranks and rivals: A theory of competition. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,'' ''32,'' 970-982.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity===
Stephan &amp; Renfro (2016) predicted that, the more important group membership is to ingroup members’ sense of personal identity, the more likely those people will feel threatened by and uncomfortable when interacting with other groups. According to this prediction, people with strong in-group identification are likely to be more focused on differences between the groups, thus giving them more motivation to hold negative stereotypes of other groups so that they can believe that their group is the best. &lt;ref name="Stephan"&gt;Stephan, W.G., &amp; Renfro, C.L. (2016). The Role of Threat in Intergroup Relations. In Mackie, D.M. &amp; Smith, E.R. (Eds.), From Prejudice to Intergroup Emotions: Differentiated Reactions to Social Groups, (191-207). ProQuest Ebook Central. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
There may be a link between the personal importance of group membership and the larger culture in which the groups live. Collectivistic cultures, for example, place a greater emphasis on the importance of group membership compared to individualistic cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Markus, H.R. &amp; Kitayama, S. (1991). Culture and the Self: Implications for Cognition, Emotion, and Motivation. Psychological Review, 98, 224-253.&lt;/ref&gt; Culture can also influence perceived threat between groups through the culture’s level of uncertainty avoidance. Hofstede &amp; Bond (1984) define uncertainty avoidance as “the degree to which people feel threatened by ambiguous situations, and have created beliefs and institutions that try to avoid these.”&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, G. &amp; Bond, M. H., (1984). Hofstede’s Culture Dimensions: An Independent Validation Using Rokeach’s Value Survey. Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 15, 417-433.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephan &amp; Renfro (2016) thus suggest that cultures which hold norms and laws as very important are likely to perceive threat from “unfamiliar groups.”&lt;ref name="Stephan"/&gt; Further research on these topics can better inform the role of culture in intergroup relationships.

==Research applications== 
The Integrated Threat Theory has been used in research on various social groups, including immigrants, Muslims, tourists, and more. 

===Immigrants===
Multiple studies on inter-group relations have focused on immigrants. For example, Ward and Masgoret (2006) built upon ITT in combination with the Instrumentive Model of Group Conflict to test a model of attitudes toward immigrants, using participants from New Zealand. These participants filled out questionnaires that measured Multicultural Ideology, Intergroup Anxiety, Contact with Immigrants, Perceived Intergroup Threat, and Attitudes toward Immigrants. The results supported the model, suggesting that increased contact with immigrants and multicultural ideology are related to lower levels of perceived threat from immigrants, which is in turn directly related to more positive attitudes towards immigrants. &lt;ref&gt;Ward, C. &amp; Masgoret, A.M. (2006). An integrative model of attitudes towards immigrants. International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 30, 671-682. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Croucher (2013) used the ITT framework to explore reasons that dominant groups in France, Germany, and Great Britain sometimes resist Muslim immigrants’ efforts to assimilate. The data was collected through questionnaires, which included measures for symbolic threats, realistic threats, stereotypes, perception of immigrants’ motivation to assimilate, and multigroup ethnic identity. The results supported the theory that the more that the dominant groups felt threatened by the immigrants, the less they thought that the immigrants wanted to assimilate into their country.&lt;ref&gt; Croucher, S.M. (2013). Integrated threat theory and acceptance of immigrant assimilation: an analysis of Muslim immigration in Western Europe. Communication Monographs, 80, 46-62. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Similarly, Rohmann, Piontkowski, and van Randenborgh (2008) used the ITT framework to examine the relationship between perceived threat and a dominant group’s expectation of an immigrant group’s attitude about acculturation. Their research included two studies, one in which German participants were asked about their expectations of French and Turkish immigrants in Germany and another in which German participants were asked about their expectations of two fictitious groups, based on paragraph-long descriptions. Results from both studies suggest that levels of perceived threat are higher if dominant groups expect that an immigrant group has different attitudes about acculturation than the dominant group does.&lt;ref&gt;Rohmann, A., Piontkowski, U., &amp; van Randenborgh, A. (2008). When attitudes do not fit: discordance of acculturation attitudes as an antecedent of intergroup threat. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 34, 337-352.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslims===
Tausch, Hewstone, and Roy (2009) examined Muslim relations with Hindus in India. ITT was incorporated into their research in order to examine which factors are important in perceived threat between the minority Muslim and majority Hindu groups of India. Their data was collected through a survey given to both Muslim and Hindu students at the same university, which measured contact quantity, contact quality, perceived relative status of the two groups, realistic threats, symbolic threats, intergroup anxiety, preference for social distance, and in-group bias. &lt;ref name= "Tausch"&gt;Tausch, N., Hewstone, M., &amp; Roy, R. (2009). The relationships between contact, status and prejudice: An integrated threat theory analysis of Hindu–Muslim relations in India. Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology, 19, 83-94.&lt;/ref&gt;Results showed that symbolic threat was important for Hindus’ levels of perceived threat while realistic threat was important for Muslims’ levels of perceived threat.&lt;ref name= "Tausch"/&gt; 

Gonzalez and colleagues (2008) carried out similar research in the Netherlands, examining the prejudice of Dutch youth, who are members of the majority, against the Muslim minority in the country. Their data was collected through a questionnaire given to high schoolers in different cities, which measured support for multicultural ideologies, frequency of contact with Muslims, in‐group identification, realistic economic threat, symbolic threats, stereotypes, and prejudicial attitudes towards Muslims.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"&gt;Gonzalez, K.V., Verkuyten, M.W., Jeroen Poppe, E. (2008). Prejudice towards Muslims in The Netherlands: Testing integrated threat theory. British Journal of Social Psychology, 47, 667-685.&lt;/ref&gt; Results showed that prejudicial attitudes were related to higher perception of symbolic threats and more belief in stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"/&gt; 

Uenal (2016) applied the ITT framework to better understand factors involved in the presence of [[Islamophobic]] conspiracy stereotypes in Europe. The data was collected through an online survey given to German university students which measured [[ambiguity intolerance]], belief in a [[clash of civilizations]], realistic threats, symbolic threats, and levels of education.&lt;ref name="Uenal"&gt; Uenal, F. (2016). The "Secret Islamization" of Europe: Exploring Integrated Threat Theory for Predicting Islamophobic Conspiracy Stereotypes. International Journal Of Conflict And Violence, 10, 94-108.&lt;/ref&gt; Ambiguity intolerance was found to be related to increased conspiracy stereotypes through increased perceptions of symbolic threat. Belief in a clash of civilizations was found to be related to higher levels of realistic and symbolic threat and higher levels of belief in conspiracy stereotypes. Higher education levels showed the opposite trends, as it was related to lower levels of perceived threat and lower levels of belief in conspiracy stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Uenal"/&gt;

===Tourists===
Tourism can bring different groups into contact and has thus been the subject of some research on inter-group relations using ITT. For example, Ward and Berno (2011) used ITT and contact hypothesis as theoretical backgrounds for predicting attitudes about tourism in Fiji and New Zealand. They collected data through surveys, which included measures of perceived impact of tourism, contact with tourists, the four aspects of the original ITT, and attitudes towards tourists.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt; Ward, C. &amp; Berno, T. (2011). Beyond social exchange theory: Attitudes towards tourists. Annals of Tourism Research, 38, 1556-1569. &lt;/ref&gt; Following the expectations of ITT, the data showed that lower levels of perceived realistic threat, symbolic threat, and intergroup anxiety, and more positive stereotypes were useful predictors of positives attitudes about tourism.&lt;ref name="Ward"/&gt; Monterubio (2016) applied ITT in studying negative attitudes towards spring break tourists in Cancun, Mexico. Data was collected through interviews with Cancun residents, which included questions about the social impact of spring break and attitudes towards spring breakers.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;Monterrubio, C. (2016). The impact of spring break behaviour: An integrated threat theory analysis of residents' prejudice. Tourism Management, 54, 418-427.&lt;/ref&gt; Transcripts of these interviews were then analyzed for themes, including the four components of the original ITT. The results suggested that realistic threats and intergroup anxiety were relevant aspects of prejudice against spring break tourists, largely because of the influence of their behavior.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; 

==Critique of the theory==
Stephan &amp; Renfro (2016) updated ITT into the two-factor model and admitted that “ultimately, the model is circular.” The theory states that perceived threat leads to prejudice but the outcomes of that prejudice itself can also lead into increased perceived threat.&lt;ref name="Stephan"/&gt; 

[[Anxiety/Uncertainty Management]] Theory counters the way that ITT conceptualizes anxiety as harmful for relationships between social groups. Instead, it understands anxiety as helpful for leading to more effective communication between groups. &lt;ref&gt;Gudykunst, W. D. (1995). Anxiety/uncertainty management (AUM) theory: Current status. International and intercultural communication annual, 19, 8-58. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic biography==
Shapiro obtained his Bachelor's degree in English from [[Harvard College]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="crimson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bwsp"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/13/science/the-biologist-who-saw-a-pattern.html|title=The Biologist Who Saw a Pattern|first=Gina|last=Kolata|authorlink=Gina Kolata|journal=[[New York Times]]|date=October 13, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, inspired by a [[genetics]] course he had taken as a senior,&lt;ref name="beckwith"&gt;{{citation|title=Making genes, making waves: a social activist in science|first=Jonathan R.|last=Beckwith|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-674-00928-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; he shifted from English to science, earned a doctorate in genetics from [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] in 1968, and did postdoctoral research with [[Jon Beckwith]] at the [[Harvard Medical School]]. He was troubled by the potential [[genetic engineering]] applications of his research.&lt;ref name="beckwith"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/05/science/elusive-genetic-switch-at-last-yields-image-of-its-3-d-structure.html|title=Elusive Genetic Switch At Last Yields Image Of Its 3-D Structure|first=Gina|last=Kolata|authorlink=Gina Kolata|journal=[[New York Times]]|date=March 5, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Harvard Geneticist Turns to Social Ills|journal=[[Boston Globe]]|first=Richard|last=Knox|date=January 20, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent two years teaching genetics in [[Havana, Cuba]], before returning to another postdoctorate with Harlyn Halvorson at [[Brandeis University]].&lt;ref name="bwsp"/&gt; Since 1973, he has worked as a professor of microbiology at the University of Chicago, and has also been a visiting professor from time to time, including once as a Darwin Prize Visiting Professor at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://shapiro.bsd.uchicago.edu/cv.shtml | title=Curriculum Vitae, James A. Shapiro | publisher=University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
While working with Beckwith at Harvard, Shapiro was part of the first team to isolate a single [[gene]] from an organism.&lt;ref name="bwsp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/11/23/archives/scientists-isolate-a-gene-step-in-heredity-control-scientists.html|title=Scientists Isolate a Gene; Step in Heredity Control|journal=[[New York Times]]|date=November 23, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/12/08/archives/playing-with-biological-fire.html|title=Playing With Biological Fire|journal=[[New York Times]]|date=8 December 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gene they isolated was ''[[lac operon|lacZ]]'', which codes for the [[β-galactosidase]] [[enzyme]] used by ''[[E. coli]]'' bacteria to digest the sugars in milk. Their technique involved [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]] of two complementary copies of the gene into two different [[bacteriophage]]s, then mixing the genetic material from the two phages, and finally using a [[nuclease]] to degrade the single-stranded phage genome, leaving only the double-stranded DNA formed by the two copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ppRmC9-a6JQC&amp;pg=PA42|title=The lac Operon: a short history of a genetic paradigm|first=Benno|last=Müller-Hill|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1996|isbn=978-3-11-014830-5|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper published in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' in 1979, Shapiro was the first to propose [[replicative transposition]] as a mechanism for gene mobility. In this model, genes such as [[retrotransposon]]s are copied from one [[DNA]] sequence to another via a process in which the two sequences combine to form an intermediate "theta" shape, sometimes called a "Shapiro intermediate".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8oIaOGHURroC&amp;pg=PA46|title=Lateral DNA transfer: mechanisms and consequences|first=Frederic|last=Bushman|publisher=CSHL Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-87969-621-4|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Shapiro showed that bacteria cooperate in communities that exhibit complex behavior such as [[hunting]], building protective structures, and spreading spores, and in which individual bacteria may sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the larger community.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/05/science/some-thoughts-on-self-sacrifice.html|title=Some Thoughts on Self Sacrifice|first=Malcolm W.|last=Browne|journal=[[New York Times]]|date=July 5, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/13/science/bacteria-are-found-to-thrive-on-a-rich-social-life.html|title=Bacteria Are Found to Thrive on a Rich Social Life|journal=[[New York Times]]|first=Gina|last=Kolata|authorlink=Gina Kolata|date=October 13, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Scientist uncovers secret lives of bacteria|journal=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=December 15, 2004|first=Sandra|last=Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this work, Shapiro believes that cooperative behavior is a fundamental organizing concept for biological activity at all levels of complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/14/science/biologists-tally-generosity-s-rewards.html|title=Biologists Tally Generosity's Rewards|journal=[[New York Times]]|first=Malcolm W.|last=Browne|date=April 14, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shapiro has also studied [[pattern formation]] in bacteria, an area where he feels that there are new mathematical principles to be discovered that also underlie the growth of [[crystal]]s and the shape of [[cosmology|cosmological structures]].&lt;ref name="bwsp"/&gt; For instance, he found that the gut bacterium ''[[Proteus mirabilis]]'' forms complex terraced rings, an [[emergent property]] of simple rules that the bacterium uses to avoid neighboring cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Making the complex simple|date=January 25, 2001|journal=[[The Economist]]|url=http://www.economist.com/node/484994?Story_ID=484994&amp;CFID=756778&amp;CFTOKEN=91709399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has proposed the term [[natural genetic engineering]] to account for how novelty is created in the course of biological evolution. It has been criticized by some.&lt;ref&gt;Bezak, Eva (2011). "(Review) Evolution: A View from the 21st Century". Australasian Physical &amp; Engineering Science in Medicine 34 (4): 643–645.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buratti, Emanuele (2012). "Evolutionary Lessons for 21st Century Molecular Biotechnologists". Molecular Biotechnology 52 (1): 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Laurence A (May–June 2011).

"(Review) Evolution: A View from the 21st Century". Trends in Evolutionary Biology 4 (e6): 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4476">[[Image:Gedimin grav xvii.jpg|thumb|Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania]]

There are 6 surviving transcripts of '''letters of Gediminas''' written in 1323–1324 by Grand Duke [[Gediminas]]. These letters are one of the first surviving documents from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Since they were sent to the Western Europe, the pope, merchants, and craftspeople, they were written in [[Latin]].

The first letter was written to [[Pope John XXII]]. Gediminas claimed that the [[Teutonic Knights]] did not act in the interest of the Catholic faith. Instead, they brutally devastated the land. The people were forced into resistance. Gediminas enumerated many crimes and damages done by the knights; for example, he claimed that his predecessor [[Vytenis]] sent a letter to the [[Franciscan]] monks asking for two brothers who could come to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to look after a local church. When the Teutonic Knights learned about the letter, they sent their army and destroyed the church. In the last sentence Gediminas vaguely promised to accept Christianity and obey the pope.

The second letter was written on January 25, 1323 to the German cities of [[Lübeck]], [[Sund, Sweden|Sund]], [[Bremen]], [[Magdeburg]], [[Cologne]] and other cities in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Gediminas explained that the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was very tolerant to the Christians, but remained pagan and did not accept Christianity only because of brutal Teutonic Knights. He told about the first letter sent to the pope and his intentions to baptize in the Catholic rite. Gediminas invited knights, [[squire]]s, merchants, doctors, smiths, wheelwrights, [[shoemaking|cobbler]]s, [[Skinner (profession)|skinners]], millers, and others to come to the Grand Duchy and practice their trade and faith without any restrictions. The peasants were promised tax exemption for ten years. The merchants were also exempt from any tariffs or taxes. This letter is best known because [[Vilnius]], capital of Lithuania, was mentioned in written sources for the first time. Therefore, 1323 is considered to be the official founding year of Vilnius. Gediminas is considered to be the city's founder even though the city existed years before Gediminas' reign. Also, Vilnius is unambiguously mentioned as the capital city. His invitation notably included German Jews as well as Christians, and its issuance is closely linked to the establishment of the [[Litvaks|Jewish community in Lithuania]].

The third letter addressed to Lübeck, [[Rostock]], Sund, [[Greifswald]], [[Stetin]], [[Gotland]] cities was written on May 26, 1323. In essence it repeated the second letter. It asked for various craftspeople (the list of crafts was expanded) to come to Lithuania and practice their trade. It said that there were three churches in the duchy: two Franciscan (in Vilnius and in [[Navahradak]]) and one [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]. Everyone was free to use them.

The fourth and the fifth letters were also written on May 26, 1323 and were addressed to the Franciscan and Dominican Orders. Gediminas, in anticipation of his baptism, invited priests and monks to come to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He also asked to spread the word to craftspeople that they were welcome in Lithuania. In the letter to the Dominicans, Gediminas mentioned that his seal was burned by the Teutonic Knights.

The last surviving letter was written on September 22, 1324 and was addressed to the bishop of [[Tartu]], Erzel, ruler of [[Tallinn]] land, and Council of [[Riga]]. It reported that the Teutonic Knights violated a peace treaty signed earlier. The Knights attacked border regions, killed residents, and took all valuables. Many messengers were captured and killed. Gediminas asked for help enforcing the treaty.

[[File:Decree of Pixodaros.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Decree of [[Pixodaros]]'' in the Lycian script]]

The '''Lycian alphabet''' was used to write the [[Lycian language]]. It was an extension of the Greek alphabet, with half a dozen additional letters for sounds not found in Greek. It was largely similar to the [[Lydian alphabet|Lydian]] and the [[Phrygian alphabet]]s.

==The alphabet==

The Lycian alphabet&lt;ref&gt;Adiego (2007) page 764.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryce (1986) pages 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt; contains letters for 29 sounds. Some sounds are represented by more than one symbol, which is considered one "letter". There are six vowel letters, one for each of the four oral vowels of Lycian, and separate letters for two of the four nasal vowels. Nine of the Lycian letters do not appear to derive from the Greek alphabet.

In some ways, [[Modern Greek phonology|Modern Greek]] resembles Lycian more in its orthography than it does Ancient Greek.

==Unicode==

{{Buddhism}}

'''Manas-vijnana''' (Skt. "'मानस-विज्ञान"'; '''mānas-vijñāna'''; "mind-knowledge", compare ''[[mantra|man-tra]]'', [[Jnana|jñāna]]) is the seventh of the [[Eight Consciousnesses|eight consciousnesses]] as taught in [[Yogacara]] and [[Zen]] Buddhism, the [[higher consciousness]] or [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive consciousness]] that on the one hand localizes experience through thinking and on the other hand universalizes experience through intuitive perception of the universal mind of [[alayavijnana]]. Manas-vijnana, also known as klista-manas-vijnana or simply manas, is not to be confused with ''manovijnana'' which is the sixth consciousness.

== Overlapping Pali terms for "mind" ==
According to [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], the post-canonical Pali [[atthakatha|commentary]] uses the three terms ''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'', ''[[Manas (early Buddhism)|mano]]'' and ''[[citta]]'' as synonyms for the mind sense base (''mana-[[ayatana]]''); however, in the [[Sutta Pitaka]], these three terms are generally contextualized differently:
* '''''Viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a''''' refers to awareness through a specific internal sense base, that is, through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body or mind.  Thus, there are six sense-specific types of ''Viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a''.  It is also the basis for personal continuity within and across lives.
* '''''[[Manas (early Buddhism)|Manas]]''''' refers to mental "actions" (''kamma''),  as opposed to those actions that are physical or verbal.  It is also the sixth internal sense base (''[[ayatana]]''), that is, the "mind base," cognizing  mental sensa (''dhammā'') as well as sensory information from the physical sense bases.
* '''''[[Citta]]''''' includes the formation of thought, emotion and volition; this is thus the subject of Buddhist mental development (''[[Buddhist meditation|bhava]]''), the mechanism for release.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), pp. 769-70, ''n''. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overlapping Sanskrit terms for "mind" ==
According to [[Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki]] (who uses the term "Manas" rather than "Manas Vijnana" for the seventh consciousness) the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] presents the Zen view of the [[Eight Consciousnesses]] rather than the Yogacara view. In his introduction to his translation of the Lankavatara Sutra he clarifies the distinction between the overlapping terms:

:What may be termed Buddhist psychology in the Laṅkā consists in the analysis of [[mind]], that is, in the classification of the Vijñānas. To understand thus the psychology of Buddhism properly the knowledge of these terms is necessary: citta, manas, vijñāna, manovijñāna, and ālayavijñāna.
 
:To begin with [[vijnana|Vijñāna]]. Vijñāna is composed of the prefix vi, meaning "to divide", and the root jñā which means "to perceive", "to know". Thus, Vijñāna is the faculty of distinguishing or discerning or judging. When an object is presented before the eye, it is perceived and judged as a red apple or a piece of white linen; the faculty of doing this is called eye-vijñāna. In the same way, there are ear-vijñāna for sound, nose-vijñāna for odour, tongue-vijñāna for taste, body-vijñāna for touch, and thought-vijñāna (manovijñāna) for ideas—altogether six forms of Vijñāna for distinguishing the various aspects of world external or internal.
 
:Of these six Vijñānas, the Manojivñāna is the most important as it is directly related to an inner faculty known as Manas. Manas roughly corresponds to mind as an organ of thought, but in fact it is more than that, for it is also a strong power of attaching itself to the result of thinking. The latter may even be considered subordinate to this power of attachment. The Manas first wills, then it discriminates to judge; to judge is to divide, and this dividing ends in viewing existence dualistically. Hence the Manas' tenacious attachment to the dualistic interpretation of existence. Willing and thinking are inextricably woven into the texture of Manas.
 
:[[Citta]] comes from the root cit, "to think", but in the Laṅkā the derivation is made from the root ci, "to pile up", "to arrange in order". The Citta is thus a storehouse where the seeds of all thoughts and deeds are accumulated and stored up. The Citta, however, has a double sense, general and specific. When it is used in the general sense it means "mind", "mentation", "ideas", including the activities of Manas and Manovijñāna, and also of the Vijñānas; while specifically it is a synonym of Ālayavijñāna in its relative aspects, and distinguishable from all the rest of the mental faculties. When, however, it is used in the form of Citta-mātra, Mind-only, it acquires still another connotation. We can say that Citta appears here in its highest possible sense, for it is then neither simply mentation nor intellection, nor perception as a function of consciousness. It is identifiable with the Ālaya in its absolute aspect. This will become clearer later on.
 
:[[alayavijnana|Ālayavijñāna]] is ālaya+vijñāna, and ālaya is a store where things are hoarded for future use. The Citta as a cumulative faculty is thus identified with the Ālayavijñāna. Strictly speaking, the Ālaya is not a Vijñāna, has no discerning power in it; it indiscriminately harbours all that is poured into it through the channel of the Vijñānas. The Ālaya is perfectly neutral, indifferent, and does not offer to give judgments.

== Various descriptions of "Manas-vijnana" ==
* One of the primary functions of Manas-vijnana is to perceive the subjective position of the [[store consciousness]]  and erroneously regard it as one's own [[Ego (religion)|ego]], thereby creating ego [[Upādāna|attachment]].
* The basic nature of Manas-vijnana is that of [[thought]].
* There is a difference between the "thought" of this seventh consciousness, Manas-vijnana, and the sixth consciousness "thought" of cognition.
* Not consciously controllable, Manas-vijnana is said to be a mind of a realm that gives rise to contradiction of conscious decisions, and to incessant self-love.
* Manas-vijnana can be described as "the consciousness which sees the limits of human variation from within".
* Manas-vijnana consciousness is also described as the place where good and evil are eternally accumulated.
* Manas-vijnana consciousness is theorized as the connecting realm between the ''mano''-consciousness and the ''ālayavijñāna''. (citation or clarification needed)
* Manas-vijnana as the seventh consciousness is the basis of human existence, which unceasingly continues and changes, and serves as the ground for the sixth consciousness of cognition.
* In part II of [[Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki]]'s Introduction,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lirs.ru/do/lanka_eng/lanka-intro.htm#introduction The Lankavatara Sutra: Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; to his translation of the [[Lankavatara Sutra]], the Manovijñāna, or "that which knows thought", is directly related to an inner faculty known as "Manas".  "Manas" is a strong power that attaches to the ''result'' of thinking.  From this viewpoint one could discern that the "thought-consciousness", that part of the mind that is conscious of thought, also has the power to "velcro" itself to a completed thought process.  This would explain the human difficulty of observing one's own thoughts, as the "manas" or "velcro" must first be detached, so to speak.

'''Marko Vuokola''' (born 1967) is a [[Finns|Finnish]] [[conceptual art]]ist. He lives and works in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]].

==Early life and education==
Marko Vuokola was born in [[Toijala]], [[Finland]] as the youngest son of photographer [[Aimo Vuokola]] and Tuula Vuokola. He studied at the Department of Sculpture at the Finnish [[Academy of Fine Arts, Helsinki]] from 1987 and received a BA in 1991, followed by studies in Media Arts at AKI, De Academie voor Kunst en Industrie in [[Enschede]], the [[Netherlands]] 1991-92. He graduated with an MA from the Finnish Academy of Fine Arts in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anhava.com/cms/docs_100/Vuokola%20CV%202013.pdf |format=PDF |title=Marko Vuokola : CV |publisher=Anhava.com |accessdate=2015-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603142516/http://www.anhava.com/cms/docs_100/Vuokola%20CV%202013.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marko Vuokola 2012"&gt;Marko Vuokola. Edited by Märit Aronsson. Trondheim Kunstmuseum, Trondheim 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marko Vuokola 2008"&gt;Marko Vuokola. The Seventh Wave. Galerie Anhava, Helsinki 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Vuokola works across a wide variety of media and materials, departing often from a conceptual exploration of issues relating to time and space. Many works, particularly in his collaborations in the OLO collective (together with [[Pasi Eerik Karjula]]), have a strongly installational and site-related character. Despite his training as a sculptor, much of his artistic oeuvre is based on photography, video or computer animation. He is often mentioned as a photographer, although it is more proper to describe his work as based on ideas just as much as on materials. His works often also explore the optical and other aspects of his artistic media, like the camera or the video projector.&lt;ref name="autogenerated10"&gt;Pontus Kyander, ”Shift. Marko Vuokola” in Marko Vuokola. The Seventh Wave. Galerie Anhava, Helsinki 2008, pp 10-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gold Thread, 1995===
During the summer of 1995, Vuokola spent five weeks in remote [[Palsinoja]] in the Finnish [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] digging for gold. The 4 grams of gold that he collected were stretched into a thin thread only 0,12&amp;nbsp;mm thick and approximately 7 m long. The work deals with time just as much as with the precious material, and also with the concepts of sculpture and visuality in art. The thread can hardly be seen when stretched across a wall, while it represents a considerable amount of physical work. The work was exhibited at [[Henry Moore Foundation|Henry Moore institute]], Leeds, in 1996 and later acquired by [[Kiasma]], the Finnish national museum of contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kokoelmat.fng.fi/app?lang=en&amp;si=http%3A%2F%2Fkansallisgalleria.fi%2FE42_Object_Identifier%2FN-1997-45 |title=Vuokola, Marko : Untitled |publisher=Kokoelmat.fng.fi |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Seventh Wave, 2001- ===
In 2001 Vuokola started up the series of works that he is most known for, The Seventh Wave. In these photographic diptychs, each panel depicts what might seem an identical motive. The difference between the images can be described in terms of time, as an unknown amount of time has passed between the two exposures. The difference is also a matter of space and material, as the physical and light circumstances have changed, even if these differences might be very small. The camera remains in the same position during these exposures. Many of these works have been shot outdoors, but this does not mean it is a series of landscape images, as several interiors and even seemingly abstract motives are included in the series.&lt;ref name="autogenerated10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Johansson, ”On the Themes and Motives of the Seventh Wave Series by Marko Vuokola” in Marko Vuokola. The Seventh Wave. Galerie Anhava, Helsinki 2008, pp 3-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Seventh Wave includes landscapes from Finland, park views from the [[Versailles]] of [[Louis XIV]], the surroundings of [[Donald Judd]]’s [[Marfa, Texas|Marfa]] in [[Texas]], interiors and exteriors from [[Hong Kong]], [[Great Barrier Island]] in [[New Zealand]],  seascapes from [[Vietnam]], a car vendor’s display room and the artist’s home and neighbourhood. The title of the series comes from the popular belief, that on sea, the seventh wave tends to be the largest.&lt;ref name="Marko Vuokola 2012"/&gt;

===RGB Series, 1996- ===
Starting as an experiment with a projector displaying a video of the projector itself – very much in the spirit of [[Nam June Paik]]’s work – RGB-light (1996) became just as much a study of how projected light behaves when interacting with visitors. The projection itself is in black and white, but the light cast on the wall of the exhibition space is prismatically split into a variety of colours, depending on how the three [[Additive color|additive primary colours]] (red, green and blue) of the RGB projector are affected by the movement of visitors in the space.
A continued experimentation with the possibilities within these aspects of optics has resulted also in the prints RGB (1996-2012) and the computer animation RGB-information (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.av-arkki.fi/en/artists/marko-vuokola_en/ |title=Artist: Marko Vuokola &amp;#124; AV-arkki |publisher=Av-arkki.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Anatomy of Images, 2012- ===
Originating in experiments with images of streaming water (Tammerkoski, 2012), Vuokola started exploring the very fundaments of digital photography. In Flora (sharpen), a large diptych of a Norwegian waterfall from the same year, a small selection of pixels from the center of each of the two digital files were enlarged to form a new diptych of their own. The connection in this case to landscape imagery is essential, as the work approaches the basics of the construction of visuality as well as digital images.&lt;ref&gt;Jyrki Siukonen, ”Chasing Falling Water” in Marko Vuokola. Edited by Märit Aronsson. Trondheim Kunstmuseum, Trondheim 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaborations==
Together with artist colleague [[Pasi Eerik Karjula]] Vuokola has formed the collective OLO since 1990. OLO is primarily working with site-engaged installations and commissions. The collaboration has resulted in over 50 works, most of them outside of Finland. The best known of these is the extensive public art work for Hietalahti Square in Helsinki (OLO No. 22, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamhelsinki.fi/en/sculpture/olo-no-22-pasi-karjula-marko-vuokola/ |title=Olo n:o 22 : Pasi Karjula, Marko Vuokola - HAM |publisher=Hamhelsinki.fi |date=2000-07-25 |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another long term collaboration although less formalised is the collective [[Forest Camp]], which was formed in 1998.

The '''mathematical principles of reinforcement''' ('''MPR''') constitute of a set of [[mathematical equation]]s set forth by [[Peter Killeen]] and his colleagues attempting to describe and predict the most fundamental aspects of behavior (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003). The three key principles of MPR, '''arousal''', '''constraint''', and '''coupling''', describe how [[incentive]]s motivate responding, how time constrains it, and how [[reinforcer]]s become associated with specific responses, respectively. [[Mathematical model]]s are provided for these basic principles in order to articulate the necessary detail of actual data.

== First principle: arousal ==
The first basic principle of MPR is [[arousal]]. Arousal refers to the activation of behavior by the presentation of incentives. An increase in activity level following repeated presentations of incentives is a fundamental aspect of [[operant conditioning|conditioning]]. Killeen, Hanson, and Osborne (1978) proposed that adjunctive (or schedule induced) behaviors are normally occurring parts of an organism's repertoire. Delivery of incentives increases the rate of adjunctive behaviors by generating a heightened level of general activity, or arousal, in organisms.

Killeen &amp; Hanson (1978) exposed pigeons to a single daily presentation of food in the experimental chamber and measured general activity for 15 minutes after a feeding. They showed that activity level increased slightly directly following a feeding and then decreased slowly over time. The rate of decay can be described by the following function:
:&lt;math&gt;b(t) = b_1 \times e ^ {\frac{-t}{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;
: {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} = y-intercept (responses per minute)
:{{mvar|t}} = time in seconds since feeding
:''&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;'' = time constant
:{{mvar|e}} = [[e (mathematical constant)|base of natural logarithm]]

The time course of the entire theoretical model of general activity is modeled by the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;R = A \times (e - \frac{t}{C} - e - \frac{t}{I})&lt;/math&gt;
:{{mvar|A}} = arousal
:{{mvar|I}} = temporal inhibition
:{{mvar|C}} = competing behaviors

To better conceptualize this model, imagine how rate of responding would appear with each of these processes individually. In the absence of temporal inhibition or competing responses, arousal level would remain high and response rate would be depicted as an almost horizontal line with a very small negative slope. Directly following food presentation, temporal inhibition is at its maximum level. It decreases quickly as time elapses, and response rate would be expected to increase up to the level of arousal in a short time. Competing behaviors such as goal tracking or hopper inspection are at a minimum directly after food presentation. These behaviors increase as the interval elapses, so the measure of general activity would slowly decrease. Subtracting these two curves results in the predicted level of general activity.

Killeen et al. (1978) then increased the frequency of feeding from daily to every fixed-time seconds. They showed that general activity level increased substantially from the level of daily presentation. Response rate asymptotes were highest for the highest rates of reinforcement. These experiments indicate that arousal level is proportional to rate of incitement, and the asymptotic level increases with repeated presentations of incentives. The increase in activity level with repeated presentation of incentives is called cumulation of arousal. The first principle of MPR states that arousal level is proportional to [[rate of reinforcement]], &lt;math&gt;A=ar&lt;/math&gt;, where:

{{mvar|A}}= arousal level

{{mvar|a}}= specific activation

{{mvar|r}}= rate of reinforcement

(Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003).

== Second principle: constraint ==
An obvious but often overlooked factor when analyzing response distributions is that responses are not instantaneous, but take some amount of time to emit (Killeen, 1994). These ceilings on response rate are often accounted for by competition from other responses, but less often for the fact that responses cannot always be emitted at the same rate at which they are elicited (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003). This limiting factor must be taken into account in order to correctly characterize what responding could be theoretically, and what it will be empirically.

An organism may receive impulses to respond at a certain rate. At low rates of reinforcement, the elicited rate and emitted rate will approximate each other. At high rates of reinforcement, however, this elicited rate is subdued by the amount of time it takes to emit a response. Response rate, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, is typically measured as the number of responses occurring in an epoch divided by the duration of an epoch. The reciprocal of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; gives the typical measure of the inter response (IRT), the average time from the start of one response to the start of another (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003). This is actually the cycle time rather than the time between responses. According to Killeen &amp; Sitomer (2003), the IRT consists of two subintervals, the time required to emit a response, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; plus the time between responses, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, response rate can be measured either by dividing the number of responses by the cycle time:
: &lt;math&gt;b = \frac{1}{\delta + \tau}&lt;/math&gt; ,

or as the number of responses divided by the actual time between responses:
: &lt;math&gt;b = \frac{1}{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; .

This instantaneous rate, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; may be the best measure to use, as the nature of the operandum may change arbitrarily within an experiment (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003).

Killeen, Hall, Reilly, and Kettle (2002) showed that if instantaneous rate of responding is proportional to rate of reinforcement, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\tau} = ar&lt;/math&gt;, then a fundamental equation for MPR results. Killeen &amp; Sitomer (2003) showed that:

if &lt;math&gt;\tau = 1 / ar&lt;/math&gt;

then &lt;math&gt;b=\frac{1}{(\delta+\frac{1}{ar})}&lt;/math&gt;,

and rearranging gives:

&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{r}{\delta r + \frac{1}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;

While responses may be elicited at a rate proportional to &lt;math&gt;A = ar&lt;/math&gt;, they can only be emitted at rate &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; due to constraint. The second principle of MPR states that the time required to emit a response constrains response rate (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003).

== Third principle: coupling ==
Coupling is the final concept of MPR that ties all of the processes together and allows for specific predictions of behavior with different schedules of reinforcement. Coupling refers to the association between responses and reinforcers. The target response is the response of interest to the experimenter, but any response can become associated with a reinforcer. Contingencies of reinforcement refer to how a reinforcer is scheduled with respect to the target response (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003), and the specific schedules of reinforcement in effect determine how responses are coupled to the reinforcer. The third principle of MPR states that the degree of coupling between a response and reinforcer decreases with the distance between them (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003). Coupling coefficients, designated as &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt;, are given for the different schedules of reinforcement. When the coupling coefficients are inserted into the activation-constraint model, complete models of conditioning are derived:

:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{c.r}{\delta r + 1/a }&lt;/math&gt;

This is the fundamental equation of MPR. The dot after the &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a placeholder for the specific contingencies of reinforcement under study (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003).

=== Fixed-ratio reinforcement schedules ===
The rate of reinforcement for fixed-ratio schedules is easy to calculate, as reinforcement rate is directly proportional to response rate and inversely proportional to ratio requirement (Killeen, 1994). The schedule feedback function is therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{b}{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

Substituting this function into the complete model gives the equation of motion for ratio schedules (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003). Killeen (1994, 2003) showed that the most recent response in a sequence of responses is weighted most heavily and given a weight of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, leaving &lt;math&gt;1-\beta&lt;/math&gt; for the remaining responses. The penultimate response receives &lt;math&gt;\beta(1-\beta)&lt;/math&gt;, the third back receives &lt;math&gt;\beta(1-\beta)^2&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th response back is given a weight of &lt;math&gt;\beta(1-\beta)^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

The sum of this series is the coupling coefficient for fixed-ratio schedules:

:&lt;math&gt;c_{FR_n} = 1 - (1-\beta)^n &lt;/math&gt;

The continuous approximation of this is:

: &lt;math&gt;c_{FR_n} = 1 - e^{-\lambda n}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the intrinsic rate of memory decay. Inserting the reinforcement rate and coupling coefficient into the activation-constraint model gives the predicted response rates for FR schedules:

:&lt;math&gt; b = \frac{c.}{\delta} - \frac{n}{\delta a} &lt;/math&gt;

This equation predicts low response rates at low ratio requirements due to the displacement of memory by consummatory behavior. However, these low rates are not always found. Coupling of responses may extend back beyond the preceding reinforcer, and an extra parameter, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt; is added to account for this. Killeen &amp; Sitomer (2003) showed that the coupling coefficient for FR schedules then becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;c_{FR_n} = 1 - (1 - \beta)n + n_0 = 1 - \epsilon(1-\beta)n &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt; is the number of responses preceding the prior reinforcer that contribute to response strength. &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; which ranges from 0 to 1 is then the degree of erasure of the target response from memory with the delivery of a reinforcer. (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\epsilon = (1-\beta)n_0&lt;/math&gt;) If &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=1&lt;/math&gt;, erasure is complete and the simpler FR equation can be used.

=== Variable-ratio reinforcement schedules ===
According to Killeen &amp; Sitomer (2003), the duration of a response can affect the rate of memory decay. When response durations vary, either within or between organisms, then a more complete model is needed, and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is replaced with &lt;math&gt;1-e^{-\lambda\delta}&lt;/math&gt; yielding:

:&lt;math&gt;1-\epsilon(1-\beta)\delta n = 1-\epsilon e^{-\lambda \delta n}&lt;/math&gt;

Idealized variable-ratio schedules with a mean response requirement of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; have a constant probability of &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt; of a response ending in reinforcement (Bizo, Kettle, &amp; Killeen, 2001). The last response ending in reinforcement must always occur and receives strengthening of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. The penultimate response occurs with probability &lt;math&gt;1-p&lt;/math&gt; and receives a strengthening of &lt;math&gt;\beta(1-\beta)&lt;/math&gt; . The sum of this process up to infinity is (Killeen 2001, Appendix):

: &lt;math&gt;C(n) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \beta (1 - \beta)^{j-1} (1-p)^{j-1}&lt;/math&gt;{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The coupling coefficient for VR schedules ends up being:

&lt;math&gt;c_{VR_n}=\frac{n}{n+ \frac{(1-b)}{b}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by degree of erasure of memory gives:

&lt;math&gt;c_{VR_n}=\frac{n}{n+\epsilon\frac{(1-\beta)}{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt;

The coupling coefficient can then be inserted into the activation-constraint model just as the coupling coefficient for FR schedules to yield predicted response rates under VR schedules:

&lt;math&gt;b= \frac{c_{VR_n}}{\delta}-\frac{n}{\delta a}&lt;/math&gt;

In interval schedules, the schedule feedback function is

&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{1}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum average time between reinforcers (Killeen, 1994). Coupling in interval schedules is weaker than ratio schedules, as interval schedules equally strengthen all responses preceding the target rather than just the target response. Only some proportion &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; of memory is strengthened. With a response requirement, the final, target response must receive strength of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. All preceding responses, target or non-target, receive a strengthening of &lt;math&gt;1-\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

Fixed-time schedules are the simplest time dependent schedules in which organisms must simply wait t seconds for an incentive. Killeen (1994) reinterpreted temporal requirements as response requirements and integrated the contents of memory from one incentive to the next. This gives the contents of memory to be:

N

MN= lò e-lndn

0

This is the degree of saturation in memory of all responses, both target and non-target, elicited in the context (Killeen, 1994). Solving this equation gives the coupling coefficient for fixed-time schedules:

c=r(1-e-lbt)

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the proportion of target responses in the response trajectory. Expanding into a power series gives the following approximation:

c» rlbt
 1+lbt
This equation predicts serious instability for non-contingent schedules of reinforcement.

Fixed-interval schedules are guaranteed a strengthening of a target response, b=w1, as reinforcement is contingent on this final, contiguous response (Killeen, 1994). This coupling is equivalent to the coupling on FR 1 schedules

w1=b=1-e-l.

The remainder of coupling is due to the memory of preceding behavior. The coupling coefficient for FI schedules is:

c= b +r(1- b -e-lbt).

Variable-time schedules are similar to random ratio schedules in that there is a constant probability of reinforcement, but these reinforcers are set up in time rather than responses. The probability of no reinforcement occurring before some time t’ is an exponential function of that time with the time constant t being the average IRI of the schedule (Killeen, 1994). To derive the coupling coefficient, the probability of the schedule not having ended, weighted by the contents of memory, must be integrated.
 ∞
M= lò e-n’t/te-ln’ dn’
 0
In this equation, t’=n’t, where t is a small unit of time. Killeen (1994) explains that the first exponential term is the reinforcement distribution, whereas the second term is the weighting of this distribution in memory. Solving this integral and multiplying by the coupling constant r, gives the extent to which memory is filled on VT schedules:

c=rlbt
 1+lbt

This is the same coupling coefficient as an FT schedule, except it is an exact solution for VT schedules rather than an approximation. Once again, the feedback function on these non-contingent schedules predicts serious instability in responding.

As with FI schedules, variable-interval schedules are guaranteed a target response coupling of b. Simply adding b to the VT equation gives:
 ∞
M= b+ lò e-n’t/te-ln’ dn’
 1
Solving the integral and multiplying by r gives the coupling coefficient for VI schedules:

c= b+(1-b) rlbt
 1+lbt

The coupling coefficients for all of the schedules are inserted into the activation-constraint model to yield the predicted, overall response rate. The third principle of MPR states that the coupling between a response and a reinforcer decreases with increased time between them (Killeen &amp; Sitomer, 2003).

Mathematical principles of reinforcement describe how incentives fuel behavior, how time constrains it, and how contingencies direct it. It is a general theory of reinforcement that combines both contiguity and correlation as explanatory processes of behavior. Many responses preceding reinforcement may become correlated with the reinforcer, but the final response receives the greatest weight in memory. Specific models are provided for the three basic principles to articulate predicted response patterns in many different situations and under different schedules of reinforcement. Coupling coefficients for each reinforcement schedule are derived and inserted into the fundamental equation to yield overall predicted response rates.

[[File:OZ5-2-94.JPG|thumb|A [[political cartoon]] from an 1894 [[Puck (magazine)|''Puck'' magazine]] by illustrator S.D. Ehrhart, shows a farm woman labeled "Democratic Party" sheltering from a tornado of political change.]]

A '''metaphor''' is a [[figure of speech]] that, for rhetorical effect, directly refers to one thing by mentioning another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metaphor|title=Definition of METAPHOR|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may provide clarity or identify hidden similarities between two ideas. [[Antithesis]], [[hyperbole]], [[metonymy]] and [[simile]] are all types of metaphor.&lt;ref name="English Language 1992 pp.653"&gt;The Oxford Companion to the English Language (1992) pp.653&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most commonly cited examples of a metaphor in English literature is the "[[All the world's a stage]]" monologue from ''[[As You Like It]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances ...
:—[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[As You Like It]]'', 2/7&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shakespeare.mit.edu/asyoulikeit/full.html |title=As You Like It: Entire Play |publisher=Shakespeare.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This quotation expresses a metaphor because the world is not literally a stage. By asserting that the world is a stage, Shakespeare uses points of comparison between the world and a stage to convey an understanding about the mechanics of the world and the behavior of the people within it.

''The Philosophy of Rhetoric'' (1937) by rhetorician [[I. A. Richards]] describes a metaphor as having two parts: the '''tenor''' and the '''vehicle'''. The tenor is the subject to which attributes are ascribed. The vehicle is the object whose attributes are borrowed. In the previous example, "the world" is compared to a stage, describing it with the attributes of "the stage"; "the world" is the '''tenor''', and "a stage" is the '''vehicle'''; "men and women" is the secondary tenor, and "players" is the secondary vehicle.

Other writers employ the general terms '''ground''' and '''figure''' to denote the tenor and the vehicle. [[Cognitive linguistics]] uses the terms '''target''' and '''source''', respectively.

The English ''metaphor'' derived from the 16th-century [[Old French]] word ''métaphore'', which comes from the [[Latin]] ''metaphora'', "carrying over", in turn from the [[Greek language|Greek]] μεταφορά (''metaphorá''), "transfer",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2367015 μεταφορά], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; from μεταφέρω (''metapherō''), "to carry over", "to transfer"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%dsfsafdsagsafvdfc cdasc3D%2367010 μεταφέρω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and that from μετά (''meta''), "after, with, across"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2366573 μετά], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; + φέρω (''pherō''), "to bear", "to carry".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23110599 φέρω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with other types of analogy ==

Metaphors are most frequently compared with [[simile]]s. It is said, for instance, that a metaphor is 'a condensed analogy' or 'analogical fusion' or that they 'operate in a similar fashion' or are 'based on the same mental process' or yet that 'the basic processes of analogy are at work in metaphor'. It is also pointed out that 'a border between metaphor and analogy is fuzzy'  and 'the difference between them might be described (metaphorically) as the distance between things being compared'.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski (2017) Multiple Functions of Analogical Reasoning in Science and Everyday Life. Polish Sociological Review no. 1/2017, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; A simile is a specific type of metaphor that uses the words "like" or "as" in comparing two objects. A metaphor asserts the objects in the comparison are identical on the point of comparison, while a simile merely asserts a similarity. For this reason a common-type metaphor is generally considered more forceful than a [[simile]].&lt;ref name="English Language 1992 pp.653" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Encyclopedia (6th edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

The metaphor category contains these specialized types:
* [[Allegory]]: An extended metaphor wherein a story illustrates an important attribute of the subject.
* [[Antithesis]]: A rhetorical contrast of ideas by means of parallel arrangements of words, clauses, or sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antithesis|title=Definition of ANTITHESIS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Catachresis]]: A mixed metaphor, sometimes used by design and sometimes by accident (a rhetorical fault).
* [[Hyperbole]]: Excessive exaggeration to illustrate a point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hyperbole|title=Definition of HYPERBOLE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Metonymy]]: A figure of speech using the name of one thing in reference to a different thing to which the first is associated. In the phrase "lands belonging to the crown", the word "crown" is metonymy for ruler or monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metonymy|title=Definition of METONYMY|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Parable]]: An extended metaphor told as an anecdote to illustrate or teach a moral or spiritual lesson, such as in [[Aesop's fables]] or [[parables of Jesus|Jesus' teaching method]] as told in the [[New Testament|Bible]]. 
* [[Pun]]: Similar to a metaphor, a pun alludes to another term. However, the main difference is that a pun is a frivolous allusion between two different things whereas a metaphor is a purposeful allusion between two different things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herscberger|first=Ruth|title=The Structure of Metaphor|journal=The Kenyan Review|date=Summer 1943|volume=5|issue=3|pages=433–443|jstor=4332426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metaphor, like other types of [[analogy]], can be distinguished from [[metonymy]] as one of two fundamental modes of thought. Metaphor and analogy work by bringing together concepts from different conceptual domains, while metonymy uses one element from a given domain to refer to another closely related element. A metaphor creates new links between otherwise distinct conceptual domains, while a metonymy relies on the existing links within them.

==Subtypes==
A '''[[dead metaphor]]''' is a metaphor in which the sense of a transferred image has become absent. The phrases "to grasp a concept" and "to gather what you've understood" use physical action as a metaphor for understanding. The audience does not need to visualize the action; dead metaphors normally go unnoticed. Some distinguish between a dead metaphor and a [[cliché]]. Others use "dead metaphor" to denote both.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

A '''mixed metaphor''' is a metaphor that leaps from one identification to a second inconsistent with the first, e.g.:
{{quote|I smell a rat [...] but I'll nip him in the bud"-Irish politician [[Boyle Roche]]}}
This form is often used as a parody of metaphor itself:
{{quote|If we can hit that bull's-eye then the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards... [[Checkmate]].|''[[Futurama]]'' character [[Zapp Brannigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0013045/quotes|title=Zapp Brannigan (Character)|work=IMDb|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An '''extended metaphor''', or '''conceit''', sets up a principal subject with several subsidiary subjects or comparisons. In the above quote from ''As You Like It'', the world is first described as a stage and then the subsidiary subjects men and women are further described in the same context.

== In rhetoric ==

[[Aristotle]] writes in his work the [[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|''Rhetoric'']] that metaphors make learning pleasant: "To learn easily is naturally pleasant to all people, and words signify something, so whatever words create knowledge in us are the pleasantest."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, W. Rhys Roberts, Ingram Bywater, and Friedrich Solmsen. Rhetoric. New York: Modern Library, 1954. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing Aristotle's  ''Rhetoric'', Jan Garret stated "metaphor most brings about learning; for when [Homer] calls old age "stubble", he creates understanding and knowledge through the genus, since both old age and stubble are [species of the genus of] things that have lost their bloom."&lt;ref&gt;Garret, Jan. "Aristotle on Metaphor." , Excerpts from Poetics and Rhetoric. N.p., 28 Mar. 2007. Web. 29 Sept. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphors, according to Aristotle, have "qualities of the exotic and the fascinating; but at the same time we recognize that strangers do not have the same rights as our fellow citizens".&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Richard. 1996. Artifice and persuasion: The work of metaphor in the rhetoric. In Essays on Aristotle's rhetoric, ed. Amelie Oksenberg Rorty, 385-398. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other rhetoricians have asserted the relevance of metaphor when used for a persuasive intent. [[Sonja K. Foss]] characterizes metaphors as "nonliteral comparisons in which a word or phrase from one domain of experience is applied to another domain".&lt;ref&gt;

She argues that since reality is mediated by the language we use to describe it, the metaphors we use shape the world and our interactions to it.

== Larger applications ==
[[File:Anger Symbol.jpg|thumb|A metaphorical visualization of the word [[anger]].]]
The term metaphor is used to describe more basic or general aspects of experience and cognition:
* A '''[[conceptual metaphor|cognitive metaphor]]''' is the association of object to an experience outside the object's environment
* A '''[[conceptual metaphor]]''' is an underlying association that is systematic in both language and thought
* A '''root metaphor''' is the underlying worldview that shapes an individual's understanding of a situation
* A '''nonlinguistic metaphor''' is an association between two nonlinguistic realms of experience
* A '''visual metaphor''' uses an image to create the link between different ideas
Metaphors can be implied and extended throughout pieces of literature.

=== Conceptual metaphors ===

{{Main article|Conceptual metaphor}}

Some theorists have suggested that metaphors are not merely stylistic, but that they are cognitively important as well. In ''[[Metaphors We Live By]]'', [[George Lakoff]] and Mark Johnson argue that metaphors are pervasive in everyday life, not just in language, but also in thought and action. A common definition of metaphor can be described as a comparison that shows how two things that are not alike in most ways are similar in another important way. They explain how a metaphor is simply understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another, called a "conduit metaphor". A speaker can put ideas or objects into containers, and then send them along a conduit to a listener who removes the object from the container to make meaning of it. Thus, communication is something that ideas go into, and the container is separate from the ideas themselves. Lakoff and Johnson give several examples of daily metaphors in use, including "argument is war" and "time is money". Metaphors are widely used in context to describe personal meaning. The authors suggest that communication can be viewed as a machine: "Communication is not what one does with the machine, but is the machine itself."&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, G. &amp; Johnson, M. Metaphors We Live By (IL: [[University of Chicago Press]], 1980), Chapters 1–3. (pp. 3–13).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nonlinguistic metaphors ===

Metaphors can map experience between two nonlinguistic realms. [[Musicologist]] [[Leonard Meyer]] demonstrated how purely rhythmic and harmonic events can express human emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, L. (1956) Emotion and Meaning in Music.  Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an open question whether [[synesthesia]] experiences are a sensory version of metaphor, the “source” domain being the presented stimulus, such as a musical tone, and the target domain, being the experience in another modality, such as color.&lt;ref&gt;Blechner, M. (2018) ''The Mindbrain and Dreams: An Exploration of Dreaming, Thinking, and Artistic Creation''. NY: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

Art theorist Robert Vischer argued that when we look at a painting, we "feel ourselves into it" by imagining our body in the posture of a nonhuman or inanimate object in the painting. For example, the painting ''[[The Lonely Tree]]'' by [[Caspar David Friedrich]] shows a tree with contorted, barren limbs.&lt;ref&gt;Blechner, M. (1988) Differentiating empathy from therapeutic action. [[Contemporary Psychoanalysis]], 24:301–310.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vischer, R. (1873) Über das optische Formgefühl: Ein Beitrag zur Aesthetik. Leipzig: Hermann Credner. For an English translation of selections, see Wind, E. (1963) Art and Anarchy. London: Faber and Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;  Looking at the painting, we imagine our limbs in a similarly contorted and barren shape, evoking a feeling of strain and distress. Nonlinguistic metaphors may be the foundation of our experience of visual and musical art, as well as dance and other art forms.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, M. &amp; Larson, S. (2003) "Something in the way she moves" – Metaphors of musical motion. Metaphor and Symbol, 18:63–84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whittock, T. (1992) The role of metaphor in dance. British Journal of Aesthetics, 32:242–249.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In historical linguistics ==
In historical [[onomasiology]] or in [[historical linguistics]], a metaphor is defined as a semantic change based on a similarity in form or function between the original concept and the target concept named by a word.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Joachim Grzega]] (2004), ''Bezeichnungswandel: Wie, Warum, Wozu? Ein Beitrag zur englischen und allgemeinen Onomasiologie'', Heidelberg: Winter, and Blank, Andreas (1997), ''Prinzipien des lexikalischen Bedeutungswandels am Beispiel der romanischen Sprachen'', Tübingen: Niemeyer.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, '''mouse''': ''small, gray rodent with a long tail'' → ''small, gray, computer device with a long cord''.

Some recent linguistic theories view all language in essence as metaphorical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/reith2003/lecture4.shtml |title=Radio 4 – Reith Lectures 2003 – The Emerging Mind |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical theories==

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] makes metaphor the conceptual center of his early theory of society in [[On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense|''On Truth and Lies in the Non-Moral Sense'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Nietzsche/Truth_and_Lie_in_an_Extra-Moral_Sense.htm|title=T he Nietzsche Channel: On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense|work= oregonstate.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sociologists have found his essay useful for thinking about metaphors used in society and for reflecting on their own use of metaphor. Sociologists of religion note the importance of metaphor in religious worldviews, and that it is impossible to think sociologically about religion without metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= McKinnon|first= A. M.|year= 2012|title= Metaphors in and for the Sociology of Religion: Towards a Theory after Nietzsche|work= Journal of Contemporary Religion|volume= 27, no. 2|pages= 203–216|url= http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3056/1/Nietzsche_religion_metaphor_for_repository.pdf|format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As style in speech and writing===
[[File:Tombe juive de femmes - Jewish tombstone of women.jpg|thumb|Tombstone of a [[Jewish]] woman depicting broken candles, a visual metaphor of the end of life.]]

As a characteristic of speech and writing, metaphors can serve the poetic imagination. This allows [[Sylvia Plath]], in her poem "Cut", to compare the blood issuing from her cut thumb to the running of a million soldiers, "[[Redcoat (British army)|redcoat]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, every one"; and enabling [[Robert Frost]], in "The Road Not Taken", to compare a life to a journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sylviaplathforum.com/thread2.html |title= Cut |publisher=Sylvia Plath Forum |date= |accessdate= 4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sylviaplathforum.com/index.shtml] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912170625/http://www.sylviaplathforum.com/index.shtml |date=12 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bartleby.com/119/1.html |title= 1. The Road Not Taken. Frost, Robert. 1920. Mountain Interval |publisher= Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate= 4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metaphor can serve as a device for persuading an audience of the user's argument or thesis, the so-called rhetorical metaphor.

===As a foundation of our conceptual system===
[[Cognitive linguistics|Cognitive linguists]] emphasize that metaphors serve to facilitate the understanding of one conceptual domain—typically an abstraction such as "life", "theories" or "ideas"—through expressions that relate to another, more familiar conceptual domain—typically more concrete, such as "journey", "buildings" or "food".&lt;ref name=lakoffmwlb&gt;{{Cite book |author= Lakoff G. |author2= Johnson M. |origyear= 1980|year= 2003 |title= Metaphors We Live By |location= Chicago |publisher= University of Chicago Press |isbn= 0-226-46801-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kovecses2002&gt;Zoltán Kövecses. (2002) Metaphor: a practical introduction. [[Oxford University Press]] US. {{ISBN|978-0-19-514511-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example: we ''devour'' a book of ''raw'' facts, try to ''digest'' them, ''stew'' over them, let them ''simmer on the back-burner'', ''regurgitate'' them in discussions, and ''cook'' up explanations, hoping they do not seem ''half-baked''.

{{quote|A convenient short-hand way of capturing this view of metaphor is the following: CONCEPTUAL DOMAIN (A) IS CONCEPTUAL DOMAIN (B), which is what is called a '''conceptual metaphor'''. A conceptual metaphor consists of two conceptual domains, in which one domain is understood in terms of another. A conceptual domain is any coherent organization of experience. For example, we have coherently organized [[knowledge]] about journeys that we rely on in understanding life.&lt;ref name=kovecses2002/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Lakoff and Johnson greatly contributed to establishing the importance of conceptual metaphor as a framework for thinking in language, leading scholars to investigate the original ways in which writers used novel metaphors and question the fundamental frameworks of thinking in conceptual metaphors.

From a sociological, cultural, or philosophical perspective, one asks to what extent [[ideologies]] maintain and impose conceptual patterns of thought by introducing, supporting, and adapting fundamental patterns of thinking metaphorically.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM. (2013). 'Ideology and the Market Metaphor in Rational Choice Theory of Religion: A Rhetorical Critique of “Religious Economies”'. Critical Sociology, vol 39, no. 4, pp. 529-543.[http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3714/1/rational_choice_critique_author_final_version.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; To what extent does the ideology fashion and refashion the idea of the nation as a container with borders? How are enemies and outsiders represented? As diseases? As attackers? How are the metaphoric paths of fate, destiny, history, and progress represented? As the opening of an eternal monumental moment ([[German fascism]])? Or as the path to [[communism]] (in [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[Czech language|Czech]] for example)?{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Some cognitive scholars have attempted to take on board the idea that different languages have evolved radically different concepts and conceptual metaphors, while others hold to the [[Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis|Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]. German [[philologist]] [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] contributed significantly to this debate on the relationship between culture, language, and linguistic communities. Humboldt remains, however, relatively unknown in English-speaking nations. [[Andrew Goatly]], in "Washing the Brain", takes on board the dual problem of conceptual metaphor as a framework implicit in the language as a system and the way individuals and ideologies negotiate conceptual metaphors. Neural biological research suggests some metaphors are innate, as demonstrated by reduced metaphorical understanding in psychopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meier|first1=Brian P.|display-authors=etal|title=Failing to take the moral high ground: Psychopathy and the vertical representation of morality|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=September 2007|volume=43|issue=4|pages=757–767|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.02.001|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222054362_Failing_to_take_the_moral_high_ground_Psychopathy_and_the_vertical_representation_of_morality|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James W. Underhill, in ''Creating Worldviews: Ideology, Metaphor &amp; Language'' (Edinburgh UP), considers the way individual speech adopts and reinforces certain metaphoric paradigms. This involves a critique of both communist and fascist discourse. Underhill's studies are situated in Czech and German, which allows him to demonstrate the ways individuals are thinking both within and resisting the modes by which ideologies seek to appropriate key concepts such as "the people", "the state", "history", and "struggle".

Though metaphors can be considered to be "in" language, Underhill's chapter on French, English and ethnolinguistics demonstrates that we cannot conceive of language or languages in anything other than metaphoric terms.

[[File:Monad.svg|thumb|The circled dot was used by the Pythagoreans and later Greeks to represent the first metaphysical being, the '''Monad''' or [[The Absolute]].]]
{{God}}

'''Monad''' (from Greek μονάς ''monas'', "singularity" in turn from μόνος ''monos'', "alone"),&lt;ref&gt;Compact Oxford English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; refers in [[cosmogony]] to the [[God|Supreme Being]], [[divinity]], or the totality of all things. The concept was reportedly conceived  by the [[Pythagoreans]]  and may refer variously to a single source acting alone, or to an indivisible origin, or to both.  The concept was later adopted by other philosophers, such as [[Leibniz]], who referred to the monad as an [[elementary particle]]. It had a [[geometric]] counterpart, which was debated and discussed contemporaneously by the same groups of people.

==Historical background==
According to [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]], the worldview was inspired by the [[Pythagoreans]], who called the first thing that came into existence the "monad", which begat (bore) the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]] (from the Greek word for two), which begat the [[number]]s, which begat the [[Point (geometry)|point]], begetting [[line (geometry)|line]]s or [[Wikt:finite|finiteness]],  etc.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It meant [[divinity]], the first being, or the totality of all beings, referring in [[cosmogony]] (creation theories) variously to source acting alone and/or an indivisible origin and [[abstraction (philosophy)|equivalent comparators]].&lt;ref&gt;Fairbanks, Arthur, Ed., "The First Philosophers of Greece". K. Paul, Trench, Trubner. London, 1898, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] and [[Platonism|Platonic]] philosophers like [[Plotinus]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] condemned Gnosticism (see [[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]]) for their treatment of the monad.

===Pythagorean concept===
For the Pythagoreans, the generation of number series was related to objects of [[geometry]] as well as [[cosmogony]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandywell, p. 205. ''The generation of the series of number is to the Pythagoreans, in other words, both the generation of the objects of geometry and also cosmogony. Since things equal numbers, the first unit, in generating the number series, is generating also the physical universe. (KR: 256) From this perspective ‘the monad’ or ‘One’ was readily identified with the divine origin of reality.''&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Diogenes Laertius]], from the monad evolved the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]]; from it numbers; from numbers, points; then lines, two-dimensional entities, three-dimensional entities, bodies, culminating in [[Classical element|the four elements]] earth, water, fire and air, from which the rest of our world is built up.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], '' Lives of Eminent Philosophers.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This Pythagorean cosmogony is in some sense similar to a brief passage found in the [[Daoist]] ''[[Daodejing|Laozi]]'': "From the Dao comes one, from one comes two, from two comes three, and from three comes the ten thousand things." （道生一、一生二、二生三、三生萬物。） ''Dao De Jing,'' Chapter 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern philosophy==
The term monad was later adopted from [[Greek philosophy]] by [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] ([[Monadology]]), [[John Dee]], and others.

== Etymology ==
The word ''nirvāṇa'', states Steven Collins, is from the verbal root ''vā'' "blow" in the form of past participle ''vāna'' "blown", prefixed with the preverb ''nis'' meaning "out". Hence the original meaning of the word is "blown out, extinguished". [[Sandhi]] changes the sounds: the ''v'' of ''vāna'' causes ''nis'' to become ''nir'', and then the ''r'' of ''nir'' causes [[retroflexion]] of the following ''n'': ''nis+vāna'' &gt; ''nirvāṇa''.{{sfn|Collins|2010|pp=63-64}}

The term ''nirvana'' in the soteriological sense of "blown out, extinguished" state of liberation does not appear in the [[Veda]]s nor in the [[Upanishad]]s. According to Collins, "the Buddhists seem to have been the first to call it ''nirvana''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC |year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57054-1|pages=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ideas of spiritual liberation using different terminology, with the concept of soul and Brahman, appears in Vedic texts and Upanishads, such as in verse 4.4.6 of the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Max Müller |title=Theosophy Or Psychological Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjiD_XWea7cC |year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-07326-4 |pages=307–310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been deliberate use of words in early Buddhism, suggests Collins, since Atman and Brahman were described in Vedic texts and Upanishads with the imagery of fire, as something good, desirable and liberating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC |year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57054-1|pages=216–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of ''moksha'' is connected to the Vedic culture, where it conveyed a notion of ''amrtam'', "immortality",{{sfn|Collins|2010|p=29}}{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=136}} and also a notion of a ''timeless'', "unborn", or "the still point of the turning world of time". It was also its timeless structure, the whole underlying "the spokes of the invariable but incessant wheel of time".{{refn|group=note|The wheel is a typical Vedic, or Indo-European, symbol, which is manifested in various symbols of the [[Historical vedic religion|Vedic religion]] and of Buddhism and Hinduism. See, for examples, [[Dharmacakra]], [[Chakra]], [[Chakravartin]], [[Kalachakra]], [[Dukkha]] and [[Mandala]].}} The hope for life after death started with notions of going to the worlds of the Fathers or Ancestors and/or the world of the Gods or Heaven.{{sfn|Collins|2010|p=29}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Heaven (Christianity)]] and Walhalla}}

The earliest [[Vedas|Vedic texts]] incorporate the concept of life, followed by an afterlife in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues (merit) or vices (demerit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Hastings|author2=John Alexander Selbie|author3=Louis Herbert Gray|title=Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UD8TAAAAYAAJ |year=1922|publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark|pages=616–618}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ancient Vedic [[Rishi]]s challenged this idea of afterlife as simplistic, because people do not live an equally moral or immoral life. Between generally virtuous lives, some are more virtuous; while evil too has degrees, and either permanent heaven or permanent hell is disproportionate. The Vedic thinkers introduced the idea of an afterlife in heaven or hell in proportion to one's merit, and when this runs out, one returns and is reborn.{{Sfn|Frazier|2011|pp=84-86}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Atsushi Hayakawa|title=Circulation of Fire in the Veda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7LtAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-643-90472-0|pages=101–103 with footnote 262|quote=The concept of punarmrtyu appeared, which conveys that even those who participated in rituals die again in the life after death when the merit of the ritual runs out.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krishan1997p17"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krishan|first1=Yuvraj|title=The Doctrine of Karma: Its Origin and Development in Brāhmaṇical, Buddhist, and Jaina Traditions|date=1997|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|isbn=9788120812338|pages=17–27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC&amp;lpg=PR3&amp;ots=tRXwo5Ccld&amp;dq=The%20Doctrine%20of%20Karma%3A%20Its%20Origin%20and%20Development%20in%20Br%C4%81hma%E1%B9%87ical%2C%20Buddhist%2C%20and%20Jaina%20Traditions&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZAxAQAAIAAJ|volume= Volume 8|year=1998|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|isbn=978-0-85229-633-2|page=533|quote=[These Upanishadic texts] record the traditions of sages (Rishis) of the period, notably Yajnavalkya, who was a pioneer of new religious ideas.

The Buddha is believed in the Buddhist scholastic tradition to have realized two types of nirvana, one at enlightenment, and another at his death.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014|p=590}} The first is called ''sopadhishesa-nirvana'' (nirvana with a remainder), the second ''[[parinirvana]]'' or ''anupadhishesa-nirvana'' (nirvana without remainder, or final nirvana).{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014|p=590}}

Indeed any postulated Self would lead to attachment, for it seems that for the Buddha a Self fitting the description could legitimately be a suitable subject of attachment. There is absolutely no suggestion that the Buddha thought there is some additional factor called the Self (or with any other name, but fitting the Self-description) beyond the five aggregates.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nirvana is also described as identical to achieving ''[[sunyata]]'' (emptiness), where there is no essence or fundamental nature in anything, and everything is empty.&lt;ref name="Choong1999p85"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mun-Keat Choong|title=The Notion of Emptiness in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJafx7uO0VsC| year=1999| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass| isbn=978-81-208-1649-7| pages=1–4, 85–88|quote=Emptiness is a characteristically Buddhist teaching.

Nagarjuna argued that there is no such thing as the fundamental nature, or essence, of anything. (...) In a word, all is emptiness, shunyata; instead of essence, there is a void. (...) everything is empty."; Quote (p 136): "What we can say, whichever branch of Buddhism we may have in mind, is that the state of nirvana, to which all Buddhists aspire, is like samadhi, a non-dual state. (...) the Buddhist concept of enlightened mind - bodhichitta - refers to a state beyond desire (dukkha) whereby the one who seeks nirvana has achieved shunyata, the emptiness or void described on pages 58-9."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moksha ===
{{main article|Moksha}}
The ancient soteriological concept in Hinduism is moksha, described as the liberation from the cycle of birth and death through self-knowledge and the eternal connection of Atman (soul, self) and metaphysical Brahman. Moksha is derived from the root ''muc*'' ({{lang-sa|मुच्}}) which means free, let go, release, liberate; Moksha means "liberation, freedom, emancipation of the soul".&lt;ref name=mmw&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0800/mw__0853.html मुच] Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heinrich Robert Zimmer|title=Philosophies of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bRQ5fpTmwoAC&amp;pg=PA41|year=1951|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-01758-1|page=41|quote=Moksa, from the root muc, "to loose, set free, let go, release, liberate, deliver" [...] means "liberation, escape, freedom, release, rescue, deliverance, final emancipation of the soul.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Vedas and early Upanishads, the word mucyate ({{lang-sa|मुच्यते}})&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt; appears, which means to be set free or release - such as of a horse from its harness.

The traditions within Hinduism state that there are multiple paths (''marga'') to moksha: ''jnana-marga'', the path of knowledge; ''bhakti-marga'', the path of devotion; and ''karma-marga'', the path of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chad Meister|title=Introducing Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOCT3qFirJMC |year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-14179-1|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brahma-nirvana in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' ===
The term Brahma-nirvana appears in verses 2.72 and 5.24-26 of the Bhagavad Gita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Winthrop Sargeant (Translator)|editor=Christopher Key Chapple|title=The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COuy5CDAqt4C |year=2010|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-1-4384-2840-6 |pages=157, 266–268 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the state of release or liberation; the union with the [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name="Flood" /&gt; According to Easwaran, it is an experience of blissful egolessness.{{sfn|Easwaran|2007|p=268}}

According to Zaehner, Johnson and other scholars, ''nirvana'' in the Gita is a Buddhist term adopted by the Hindus.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=48}} Zaehner states it was used in Hindu texts for the first time in the Bhagavad Gita, and that the idea therein in verse 2.71-72 to "suppress one's desires and ego" is also Buddhist.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=48}} According to Johnson the term ''nirvana'' is borrowed from the Buddhists to confuse the Buddhists, by linking the Buddhist nirvana state to the pre-Buddhist Vedic tradition of metaphysical absolute called Brahman.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=48}}

According to [[Mahatma Gandhi]], the Hindu and Buddhist understanding of ''nirvana'' are different because the nirvana of the Buddhists is [[shunyata]], emptiness, but the nirvana of the Gita means peace and that is why it is described as brahma-nirvana (oneness with Brahman).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|quote=The nirvana of the Buddhists is shunyata, emptiness, but the nirvana of the Gita means peace and that is why it is described as brahma-nirvana [oneness with Brahman]|publisher=North Atlantic Books|year=2009|title=The Bhagavad Gita&amp;nbsp;– According to Gandhi|author=Mahatma Gandhi|editor=John Strohmeier|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Noether_theorem_1st_page.png|thumb| First page of [[Emmy Noether]]'s article "Invariante Variationsprobleme" (1918), where she proved her theorem.]]
'''Noether's''' ('''first''')&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Noether's second theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt; '''theorem''' states that every [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] of the [[action (physics)|action]] of a physical system has a corresponding [[conservation law]]. The theorem was proven by mathematician [[Emmy Noether]] in 1915 and published in 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Noether E | year = 1918 | title = Invariante Variationsprobleme | journal = Nachr. D. König. Gesellsch. D. Wiss. Zu Göttingen, Math-phys. Klasse | volume = 1918 | pages = 235–257 |url= https://eudml.org/doc/59024}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a special case was proven by [[Eugène_Cosserat|E. Cosserat]] &amp; [[François_Cosserat|F. Cosserat]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Cosserat E., Cosserat F. |year = 1909 | title = Théorie des corps déformables | publisher = Hermann | place = Paris | url = http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;idno=06420001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of a physical system is the [[time integral|integral over time]] of a [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] function (which may or may not be an [[integral over space]] of a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian density function]]), from which the system's behavior can be determined by the [[principle of least action]]. This theorem only applies to continuous symmetries over [[physical space]].

Noether's theorem is used in [[theoretical physics]] and the [[calculus of variations]]. A generalization of the formulations on [[constants of motion]] in Lagrangian and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] (developed in 1788 and 1833, respectively), it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a Lagrangian alone (e.g. systems with a [[Lagrangian_mechanics#Extensions_to_include_non-conservative_forces|Rayleigh dissipation function]]). In particular, [[dissipative]] systems with [[Continuous symmetry|continuous symmetries]] need not have a corresponding conservation law.

==Basic illustrations and background==
{{unreferenced-section|date=June 2016}}
As an illustration, if a physical system behaves the same regardless of how it is oriented in space, its [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] is symmetric under continuous rotations: from this symmetry, Noether's theorem dictates that the [[angular momentum]] of the system be conserved, as a consequence of its laws of motion. The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. It is the laws of its motion that are symmetric.

As another example, if a physical process exhibits  the same outcomes regardless of place or time, then its Lagrangian is symmetric under continuous translations in space and time respectively: by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the [[conservation law]]s of [[momentum|linear momentum]] and [[energy]] within this system, respectively.

As a final example, if the behavior of a physical system does not change upon spatial or temporal reflection, then its Lagrangian has reflection symmetry and time reversal symmetry respectively: Noether's theorem says that these symmetries result in the conservation laws of [[Parity (physics)|parity]] and [[entropy]],{{cn|date=June 2018}} {{discuss|Need to resolve the case when we are discussing entropy of a closed system, which always increases.}} respectively.

Noether's theorem is important, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also as a practical calculational tool. It allows investigators to determine the conserved quantities (invariants) from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it allows researchers to consider whole classes of hypothetical Lagrangians with given invariants, to describe a physical system. As an illustration, suppose that a physical theory is proposed which conserves a quantity ''X''. A researcher can calculate the types of Lagrangians that conserve ''X'' through a continuous symmetry.  Due to Noether's theorem, the properties of these Lagrangians provide further criteria to understand the implications and judge the fitness of the new theory.

There are numerous versions of Noether's theorem, with varying degrees of generality. The original version applied only to [[ordinary differential equation]]s (used for describing distinct particles) and not [[partial differential equation]]s (used for describing fields). The original versions also assume that the Lagrangian depends only upon the first derivative, while later versions generalize the theorem to Lagrangians depending on the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; derivative.{{Disputed inline|False_claim_on_limited_applicability_of_original_version|date=June 2014}}  There are natural quantum counterparts of this theorem, expressed in  the [[Ward–Takahashi identity|Ward–Takahashi identities]]. Generalizations of Noether's theorem to [[superspace]]s also exist.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

== Informal statement of the theorem ==
All fine technical points aside, Noether's theorem can be stated informally

{{quote|If a system has a continuous symmetry property, then there are corresponding quantities whose values are conserved in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thompson, W.J. |title=Angular Momentum: an illustrated guide to rotational symmetries for physical systems |publisher=Wiley |year=1994 |isbn=0-471-55264-X |volume=1 |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O25fXV4z0B0C&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A more sophisticated version of the theorem involving fields states that:

{{quote|To every differentiable [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] generated by local actions, there corresponds a [[conserved current]].}}

The word "symmetry" in the above statement refers more precisely to the [[covariant transformation|covariance]] of the form that a physical law takes with respect to a one-dimensional [[Lie group]] of transformations satisfying certain technical criteria. The [[conservation law]] of a [[physical quantity]] is usually expressed as a [[continuity equation]].

The formal proof of the theorem utilizes the condition of invariance to derive an expression for a current associated with a conserved physical quantity. 
In modern (since ca. 1980&lt;ref&gt;The term "Noether charge" occurs in Seligman, ''Group theory and its applications in physics, 1980: Latin American School of Physics, Mexico City'', American Institute of Physics, 1981. It comes enters wider use during the 1980s, e.g. by G. Takeda in: Errol Gotsman, Gerald Tauber (eds.) ''From SU(3) to Gravity: Festschrift in Honor of Yuval Ne'eman'', 1985, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;) terminology, the  conserved quantity is called the ''Noether charge'', while the flow carrying that charge is called the ''Noether current''. The Noether current is defined [[up to]] a [[solenoidal]] (divergenceless) vector field.

In the context of gravitation, [[Felix Klein]]'s statement of Noether's theorem for action ''I'' stipulates for the invariants:&lt;ref&gt;Nina Byers (1998) [http://cwp.library.ucla.edu/articles/noether.asg/noether.html "E. Noether's Discovery of the Deep Connection Between Symmetries and Conservation Laws."] in Proceedings of a Symposium on the Heritage of Emmy Noether, held on 2–4 December 1996, at the Bar-Ilan University, Israel, Appendix B.&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|If an integral I is invariant under a continuous group G&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; with ρ parameters, then ρ  linearly independent combinations of the Lagrangian expressions are divergences.}}

==Historical context==
{{main|Constant of motion|conservation law|conserved current}}

A [[conservation law]] states that some quantity ''X'' in the mathematical description of a system's evolution remains constant throughout its motion — it is an [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]].   Mathematically, the rate of change of ''X'' (its [[derivative]] with respect to [[time]]) is zero,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dX}{dt} = 0 ~.&lt;/math&gt;

Such quantities are said to be conserved; they are often called [[constant of motion|constants of motion]] (although motion ''per se'' need not be involved, just evolution in time). For example, if the energy of a system is conserved, its energy is invariant at all times, which imposes a constraint on the system's motion and may help in solving for it. Aside from insights that such constants of motion give into the nature of a system, they are a useful calculational tool; for example, an approximate solution can be corrected by finding the nearest state that satisfies the suitable conservation laws.

The earliest constants of motion discovered were [[momentum]] and [[energy]], which were proposed in the 17th century by [[René Descartes]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] on the basis of [[collision]] experiments, and refined by subsequent researchers. [[Isaac Newton]] was the first to enunciate the conservation of momentum in its modern form, and showed that it was a consequence of [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law]]. According to [[general relativity]], the conservation laws of linear momentum, energy and angular momentum are only exactly true globally when expressed in terms of the  sum of the [[stress–energy tensor]] (non-gravitational stress–energy) and the [[Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor#Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor|Landau–Lifshitz stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor]] (gravitational stress–energy). The local conservation of non-gravitational linear momentum and energy in a free-falling reference frame is expressed by the vanishing of the covariant [[divergence]] of the [[stress–energy tensor]]. Another important conserved quantity, discovered in studies of the [[celestial mechanics]] of astronomical bodies, is the [[Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector]].

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, physicists developed more systematic methods for discovering invariants. A major advance came in 1788 with the development of [[Lagrangian mechanics]], which is related to the [[principle of least action]]. In this approach, the state of the system can be described by any type of [[generalized coordinate]]s '''q'''; the laws of motion need not be expressed in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], as was customary in Newtonian mechanics. The [[action (physics)|action]] is defined as the time integral ''I'' of a function known as the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]&amp;nbsp;''L''

::&lt;math&gt;I = \int L(\mathbf{q}, \dot{\mathbf{q}}, t) \, dt ~,&lt;/math&gt;

where the dot over '''q''' signifies the rate of change of the coordinates '''q''',

::&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{q}} = \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{dt} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Hamilton's principle]] states that the physical path '''q'''(''t'')—the one actually taken by the system—is a path for which infinitesimal variations in that path cause no change in ''I'', at least up to first order. This principle results in the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \right) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}}   ~.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, if one of the coordinates, say ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', does not appear in the Lagrangian, the right-hand side of the equation is zero, and the left-hand side requires that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_k} \right) = \frac{dp_k}{dt} = 0~,&lt;/math&gt;

where the momentum

:&lt;math&gt; p_k = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_k} &lt;/math&gt;

is conserved throughout the motion (on the physical path).

Thus, the absence of the '''ignorable''' coordinate ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' from the Lagrangian implies that the Lagrangian is unaffected by changes or transformations of ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''; the Lagrangian is invariant, and is said to exhibit a [[symmetry in physics|symmetry]] under such transformations. This is the seed idea generalized in Noether's theorem.

Several alternative methods for finding conserved quantities were developed in the 19th century, especially by [[William Rowan Hamilton]]. For example, he developed a theory of [[canonical transformation]]s which allowed changing coordinates so that some coordinates disappeared from the Lagrangian, as above, resulting in conserved canonical momenta. Another approach, and perhaps the most efficient for finding conserved quantities, is the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]].

==Mathematical expression==
{{see also|Perturbation theory}}

===Simple form using perturbations===

The essence of Noether's theorem is generalizing the ignorable coordinates outlined.

One can assume that the Lagrangian ''L'' defined above is invariant under small perturbations (warpings) of the time variable ''t'' and the [[generalized coordinate]]s '''q'''. One may write

:&lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow t^{\prime} = t + \delta t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} \rightarrow \mathbf{q}^{\prime} = \mathbf{q} + \delta \mathbf{q} ~,&lt;/math&gt;

where the perturbations ''δt'' and ''δ'''''q''' are both small, but variable. For generality, assume there are (say) ''N'' such [[symmetry transformations]] of the action, i.e. transformations leaving the action unchanged; labelled by an index ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''N''.

Then the resultant perturbation can be written as a linear sum of the individual types of perturbations,
:&lt;math&gt;\delta t = \sum_r \varepsilon_r T_r &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf{q} = \sum_r \varepsilon_r \mathbf{Q}_r ~, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[infinitesimal]] parameter coefficients corresponding to each: 
*[[Lie group#The exponential map|generator]] ''T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' of [[time evolution]], and
*[[Lie group#The exponential map|generator]] '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; of the generalized coordinates.
For translations, '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is a constant with units of [[length]]; for rotations, it is an expression linear in the components of '''q''', and the parameters make up an  [[angle]].

Using these definitions, [[Emmy Noether|Noether]] showed that the ''N'' quantities

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}} - L \right) T_r - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \cdot \mathbf{Q}_r&lt;/math&gt;

(which have the [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] of [energy]·[time] + [momentum]·[length] = [action]) are conserved ([[constants of motion]]).

==== Examples ====

;Time invariance

For illustration, consider a Lagrangian that does not depend on time, i.e., that is invariant (symmetric) under changes ''t'' → ''t'' + δ''t'', without any change in the coordinates '''q'''. In this case, ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and '''Q'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0; the corresponding conserved quantity is the total [[energy]] ''H''&lt;ref name="energy" &gt;{{harvnb|Lanczos|1970|pp=401–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}} - L. &lt;/math&gt;

;Translational invariance

Consider a Lagrangian which does not depend on an ("ignorable", as above)  coordinate ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;; so  it is invariant (symmetric) under changes ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''δq''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. In that case, ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1; the conserved quantity is the corresponding [[momentum]] ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="momentum" &gt;{{harvnb|Lanczos|1970|pp=403–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p_k = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q_k}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], these apparently separate conservation laws are aspects of a single conservation law, that of the [[stress–energy tensor]],&lt;ref name="stress–energy_tensor" &gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|pp=592–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is derived in the next section.

;Rotational invariance

The conservation of the [[angular momentum]] '''L''' = '''r''' × '''p''' is  analogous to its linear momentum counterpart.&lt;ref name="angular_momentum" &gt;{{harvnb|Lanczos|1970|pp=404–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed that the symmetry of the Lagrangian is rotational, i.e., that the Lagrangian does not depend on the absolute orientation of the physical system in space. For concreteness, assume that the Lagrangian does not change under small rotations of an angle ''δθ'' about an axis '''n'''; such a rotation transforms the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} \rightarrow \mathbf{r} + \delta\theta \, \mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since time is not being transformed, ''T''=0. Taking ''δθ'' as the ''ε'' parameter and the Cartesian coordinates '''r''' as the generalized coordinates '''q''', the corresponding '''Q''' variables are given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then Noether's theorem states that the following quantity is conserved,
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \cdot \mathbf{Q}_{r} = 
\mathbf{p} \cdot \left( \mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{r} \right) = 
\mathbf{n} \cdot \left( \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p} \right) = 
\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{L}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the component of the angular momentum '''L''' along the '''n''' axis is conserved.

If '''n''' is arbitrary, i.e., if the system is insensitive to any rotation, then every component of '''L''' is conserved; in short, [[angular momentum]] is conserved.

===Field theory version===
Although useful in its own right, the version of Noether's theorem just given is a special case of the general version derived in 1915. To give the flavor of the general theorem, a version of the Noether theorem for continuous fields in four-dimensional [[space–time]] is now given. Since field theory problems are more common in modern physics than [[mechanics]] problems, this field theory version is the most commonly used (or most often implemented) version of Noether's theorem.

Let there be a set of differentiable [[Field (physics)|fields]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; defined over all space and time; for example, the temperature &lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{x}, t)&lt;/math&gt; would be representative of such a field, being a number defined at every place and time. The [[principle of least action]] can be applied to such fields, but the action is now an integral over space and time

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S} = \int \mathcal{L} \left(\varphi, \partial_\mu \varphi, x^\mu \right) \, d^4 x&lt;/math&gt;

(the theorem can actually be further generalized to the case where the Lagrangian depends on up to the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; derivative using [[jet bundle]]s)

A continuous transformation of the fields &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; can be written infinitesimally as

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi \mapsto \varphi + \varepsilon \Psi,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is in general a function that may depend on both &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. The condition for &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; to generate a physical symmetry is that the action &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is left invariant. This will certainly be true if the Lagrangian density &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is left invariant, but it will also be true if the Lagrangian changes by a divergence,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} \mapsto \mathcal{L} + \varepsilon \partial_\mu \Lambda^\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

since the integral of a divergence becomes a boundary term according to the [[divergence theorem]]. A system described by a given action might have multiple independent symmetries of this type, indexed by &lt;math&gt;r = 1, 2, \ldots, N,&lt;/math&gt; so the most general symmetry transformation would be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi \mapsto \varphi + \varepsilon_r \Psi_r,&lt;/math&gt;

with the consequence

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} \mapsto \mathcal{L} + \varepsilon_r \partial_\mu \Lambda^\mu_r&lt;/math&gt;

For such systems, Noether's theorem states that there are &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; conserved [[conserved current|current densities]]

:&lt;math&gt;
j^\nu_r = \Lambda^\nu_r - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \varphi_{,\nu}} \cdot \Psi_r
&lt;/math&gt;

(where the dot product is understood to contract the ''field'' indices, not the &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; index or &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; index)

In such cases, the [[conservation law]] is expressed in a four-dimensional way

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_{\nu} j^\nu = 0&lt;/math&gt;

which expresses the idea that the amount of a conserved quantity within a sphere cannot change unless some of it flows out of the sphere. For example, [[electric charge]] is conserved; the amount of charge within a sphere cannot change unless some of the charge leaves the sphere.

For illustration, consider a physical system of fields that behaves the same under translations in time and space, as considered above; in other words, &lt;math&gt;L \left(\boldsymbol\varphi, \partial_\mu{\boldsymbol\varphi}, x^\mu \right)&lt;/math&gt; is constant in its third argument. In that case, ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, one for each dimension of space and time. An infinitesimal translation in space, &lt;math&gt;x^\mu \mapsto x^\mu + \varepsilon_r \delta^\mu_r&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; denoting the [[Kronecker delta]]), affects the fields as &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x^\mu) \mapsto \varphi(x^\mu - \varepsilon_r \delta^\mu_r)&lt;/math&gt;: that is, relabelling the coordinates is equivalent to leaving the coordinates in place while translating the field itself, which in turn is equivalent to transforming the field by replacing its value at each point &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; with the value at the point &lt;math&gt;x^\mu - \varepsilon X^\mu&lt;/math&gt; "behind" it which would be mapped onto &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; by the infinitesimal displacement under consideration. Since this is infinitesimal, we may write this transformation as

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_r = -\delta^\mu_r \partial_\mu \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrangian density transforms in the same way, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(x^\mu) \mapsto \mathcal{L}(x^\mu - \varepsilon_r \delta^\mu_r)&lt;/math&gt;, so

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^\mu_r = -\delta^\mu_r \mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;

and thus Noether's theorem corresponds to the conservation law for the [[stress–energy tensor]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ν&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref name="stress–energy_tensor" /&gt; where we have used &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; in place of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. To wit, by using the expression given earlier, and collecting the four conserved currents (one for each &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;) into a tensor &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, Noether's theorem gives

:&lt;math&gt;
T_\mu{}^\nu = -\delta^\nu_\mu \mathcal{L} + \delta^\sigma_\mu \partial_\sigma \varphi \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \varphi_{,\nu}} = \left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \varphi_{,\nu}}\right) \cdot \varphi_{,\mu} - \delta^\nu_\mu \mathcal{L}
&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;T_\mu{}^\nu{}_{,\nu} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

(note that we relabelled &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; at an intermediate step to avoid conflict). (However, note that the &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; obtained in this way may differ from the symmetric tensor used as the source term in general relativity; see [[Stress–energy tensor#Canonical stress.E2.80.93energy tensor|Canonical stress–energy tensor]].)

The conservation of [[electric charge]], by contrast, can be derived by considering ''Ψ'' linear in the fields ''φ'' rather than in the derivatives.&lt;ref name="charge"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|pp=593–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[quantum mechanics]], the [[probability amplitude]] ''ψ''('''x''') of finding a particle at a point '''x''' is a complex field ''φ'', because it ascribes a [[complex number]] to every point in space and time. The probability amplitude itself is physically unmeasurable; only the probability ''p'' = |''ψ''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be inferred  from a set of  measurements. Therefore, the system is invariant under transformations of the ''ψ'' field and its [[complex conjugate]] field ''ψ''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; that leave |''ψ''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; unchanged, such as

:&lt;math&gt;\psi \rightarrow e^{i\theta} \psi \ ,\ \psi^{*} \rightarrow e^{-i\theta} \psi^{*}~,&lt;/math&gt;

a complex rotation. In the limit when the phase ''θ'' becomes infinitesimally small, ''δθ'', it may be taken as the parameter ''ε'', while the ''Ψ'' are equal to ''iψ'' and −''iψ''*, respectively. A specific example is the [[Klein–Gordon equation]], the [[special relativity|relativistically correct]] version of the [[Schrödinger equation]] for [[spin (physics)|spinless]] particles, which has the Lagrangian density

:&lt;math&gt;L = \psi_{,\nu} \psi^{*}_{,\mu} \eta^{\nu \mu} + m^2 \psi \psi^{*}.&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, Noether's theorem states that the conserved (∂⋅''j'' = 0) current equals

:&lt;math&gt;j^{\nu} = i \left( \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x^{\mu}} \psi^{*} - \frac{\partial \psi^{*}}{\partial x^{\mu}} \psi \right) \eta^{\nu \mu}~,&lt;/math&gt;

which, when multiplied by the charge on that species of particle, equals the electric current density due to that type of particle. This "gauge invariance" was first noted by [[Hermann Weyl]], and is one of the prototype [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]] of physics.

== Derivations ==

===One independent variable===
Consider the simplest case, a system with one independent variable, time. Suppose the dependent variables '''q''' are such that the action integral

:&lt;math&gt;I = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L [\mathbf{q} [t], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t], t] \, dt &lt;/math&gt;

is invariant under brief infinitesimal variations in the dependent variables. In other words, they satisfy the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} [t] = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} [t].&lt;/math&gt;

And suppose that the integral is invariant under a continuous symmetry. Mathematically such a symmetry is represented as a [[flow (mathematics)|flow]], '''φ''', which acts on the variables as follows

:&lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow t' = t + \varepsilon T &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} [t] \rightarrow \mathbf{q}' [t'] = \varphi [\mathbf{q} [t], \varepsilon] = \varphi [\mathbf{q} [t' - \varepsilon T], \varepsilon]&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε'' is a real variable indicating the amount of flow, and ''T'' is a real constant (which could be zero) indicating how much the flow shifts time.

:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{\mathbf{q}} [t] \rightarrow \dot{\mathbf{q}}' [t'] = \frac{d}{dt} \varphi [\mathbf{q} [t], \varepsilon] = \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} [\mathbf{q} [t' - \varepsilon T], \varepsilon] \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t' - \varepsilon T]
.&lt;/math&gt;

The action integral flows to

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I' [\varepsilon] &amp; = \int_{t_1 + \varepsilon T}^{t_2 + \varepsilon T} L [\mathbf{q}'[t'], \dot{\mathbf{q}}' [t'], t'] \, dt' \\[6pt]
&amp; = \int_{t_1 + \varepsilon T}^{t_2 + \varepsilon T} L [\varphi [\mathbf{q} [t' - \varepsilon T], \varepsilon], \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} [\mathbf{q} [t' - \varepsilon T], \varepsilon] \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t' - \varepsilon T], t'] \, dt'
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which may be regarded as a function of ''ε''. Calculating the derivative at ''ε''' = 0 and using [[Leibniz's rule (derivatives and integrals)|Leibniz's rule]], we get

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 = {} &amp; \frac{d I'}{d \varepsilon} [0] = L [\mathbf{q} [t_2], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_2], t_2] T - L [\mathbf{q} [t_1], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_1], t_1] T \\[6pt]
&amp; {} + \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \left( - \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} T + \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} \right) + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \left( - \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{(\partial \mathbf{q})^2} {\dot{\mathbf{q}}}^2 T + \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon \partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} -
\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \ddot{\mathbf{q}} T \right) \, dt.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the Euler–Lagrange equations imply

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} T \right) 
&amp; = \left( \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \right) \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} T + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \left( \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \right) \dot{\mathbf{q}} T + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \ddot{\mathbf{q}} \, T \\[6pt]
&amp; = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} T + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \left( \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{(\partial \mathbf{q})^2} \dot{\mathbf{q}} \right) \dot{\mathbf{q}} T + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \ddot{\mathbf{q}} \, T.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into the previous equation, one gets

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 = {} &amp; \frac{d I'}{d \varepsilon} [0] \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; L [\mathbf{q} [t_2], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_2], t_2] T - L [\mathbf{q} [t_1], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_1], t_1] T - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_2] T + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_1] T \\[6pt]
&amp; {} + \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon \partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} \, dt.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Again using the Euler–Lagrange equations we get

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{d t} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} \right) 
= \left( \frac{d}{d t} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \right) \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon \partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}}
= \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon \partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into the previous equation, one gets

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 = {} &amp; L [\mathbf{q} [t_2], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_2], t_2] T - L [\mathbf{q} [t_1], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_1], t_1] T - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_2] T + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_1] T \\[6pt]
&amp; {} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} [t_2] - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} [t_1].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

From which one can see that

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} - L \right) T - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

is a constant of the motion, i.e., it is a conserved quantity. Since φ['''q''', 0] = '''q''', we get &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} = 1&lt;/math&gt; and so the conserved quantity simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} - L \right) T - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon}.&lt;/math&gt;

To avoid excessive complication of the formulas, this derivation assumed that the flow does not change as time passes. The same result can be obtained in the more general case.

===Field-theoretic derivation===
Noether's theorem may also be derived for tensor fields ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt; where the index ''A'' ranges over the various components of the various tensor fields. These field quantities are functions defined over a four-dimensional space whose points are labeled by coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt; where the index ''μ'' ranges over time (''μ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) and three spatial dimensions (''μ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3). These four coordinates are the independent variables; and the values of the fields at each event are the dependent variables. Under an infinitesimal transformation, the variation in the coordinates is written

:&lt;math&gt;x^\mu \rightarrow \xi^\mu = x^\mu + \delta x^\mu &lt;/math&gt;

whereas the transformation of the field variables is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^A \rightarrow \alpha^A (\xi^\mu) = \varphi^A (x^\mu) + \delta \varphi^A (x^\mu)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

By this definition, the field variations ''δφ''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt; result from two factors: intrinsic changes in the field themselves and changes in coordinates, since the transformed field ''α''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt; depends on the transformed coordinates ξ&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;. To isolate the intrinsic changes, the field variation at a single point ''x''&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt; may be defined

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^A (x^\mu) = \varphi^A (x^\mu) + \bar{\delta} \varphi^A (x^\mu)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If the coordinates are changed, the boundary of the region of space–time over which the Lagrangian is being integrated also changes; the original boundary and its transformed version are denoted as Ω and Ω’, respectively.

Noether's theorem begins with the assumption that a specific transformation of the coordinates and field variables does not change the [[action (physics)|action]], which is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density over the given region of spacetime. Expressed mathematically, this assumption may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\Omega^{\prime}} L \left( \alpha^A, {\alpha^A}_{,\nu}, \xi^{\mu} \right) d^{4}\xi - \int_{\Omega} L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^{\mu} \right) d^{4}x = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where the comma subscript indicates a partial derivative with respect to the coordinate(s) that follows the comma, e.g.

:&lt;math&gt;{\varphi^A}_{,\sigma} = \frac{\partial \varphi^A}{\partial x^{\sigma}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Since ξ is a dummy variable of integration, and since the change in the boundary Ω is infinitesimal by assumption, the two integrals may be combined using the four-dimensional version of the [[divergence theorem]] into the following form

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{\Omega} \left\{ 
\left[ L \left( \alpha^A, {\alpha^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) - 
L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) \right]
+ \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} \left[ L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) \delta x^\sigma \right]
\right\} d^4 x = 0
\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The difference in Lagrangians can be written to first-order in the infinitesimal variations as

:&lt;math&gt;
\left[ L \left( \alpha^A, {\alpha^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) - 
L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) \right] = 
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \varphi^A} \bar{\delta} \varphi^A + 
\frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \bar{\delta} {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}
\,.&lt;/math&gt;

However, because the variations are defined at the same point as described above, the variation and the derivative can be done in reverse order; they [[commutativity|commute]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\bar{\delta} {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma} = 
\bar{\delta} \frac{\partial \varphi^A}{\partial x^\sigma} = 
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} ( \bar{\delta} \varphi^A)
\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the Euler–Lagrange field equations

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \right) =
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \varphi^A}
&lt;/math&gt;

the difference in Lagrangians can be written neatly as

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \left[ L \left( \alpha^A, {\alpha^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) - 
L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^{\mu} \right) \right] \\[4pt]
= {} &amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \right) \bar{\delta} \varphi^A + 
\frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \bar{\delta} {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}
= \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} 
\left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \bar{\delta} \varphi^A \right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the change in the action can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_\Omega \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} 
\left\{ \frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \bar{\delta} \varphi^A + 
L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) \delta x^\sigma
\right\} d^{4}x = 0
\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Since this holds for any region Ω, the integrand must be zero

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} 
\left\{ \frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \bar{\delta} \varphi^A + 
L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) \delta x^\sigma
\right\} = 0
\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For any combination of the various [[symmetry in physics|symmetry]] transformations, the perturbation can be written

:&lt;math&gt;\delta x^{\mu} = \varepsilon X^\mu&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta \varphi^A = \varepsilon \Psi^A = \bar{\delta} \varphi^A + \varepsilon \mathcal{L}_X \varphi^A&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X \varphi^A&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lie derivative]] of φ&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt; in the ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt; direction. When ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt; is a scalar or &lt;math&gt;{X^\mu}_{,\nu} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X \varphi^A = \frac{\partial \varphi^A}{\partial x^{\mu}} X^\mu\,.&lt;/math&gt;

These equations imply that the field variation taken at one point equals

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\delta} \varphi^A = \varepsilon \Psi^A - \varepsilon \mathcal{L}_X \varphi^A\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating the above divergence with respect to ''ε'' at ''ε''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and changing the sign yields the conservation law

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial }{\partial x^\sigma} j^\sigma = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where the conserved current equals

:&lt;math&gt;
j^\sigma = 
\left[\frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \mathcal{L}_X \varphi^A - L \, X^\sigma\right]
- \left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \right) \Psi^A\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Manifold/fiber bundle derivation===
Suppose we have an ''n''-dimensional oriented [[Riemannian manifold]], ''M'' and a target manifold ''T''. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] of [[smooth function]]s from ''M'' to ''T''. (More generally, we can have smooth sections of a [[fiber bundle]] over ''M''.)

Examples of this ''M'' in physics include:
* In [[classical mechanics]], in the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formulation, ''M'' is the one-dimensional manifold '''R''', representing time and the target space is the [[cotangent bundle]] of [[space]] of generalized positions.
* In [[field (physics)|field theory]], ''M'' is the [[spacetime]] manifold and the target space is the set of values the fields can take at any given point. For example, if there are ''m'' [[real number|real]]-valued [[scalar field]]s, &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1,\ldots,\varphi_m&lt;/math&gt;, then the target manifold is '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;. If the field is a real vector field, then the target manifold is [[isomorphic]] to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Now suppose there is a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow \mathbf{R},&lt;/math&gt;

called the [[Action (physics)|action]]. (Note that it takes values into '''R''', rather than '''C'''; this is for physical reasons, and doesn't really matter for this proof.)

To get to the usual version of Noether's theorem, we need additional restrictions on the [[Action (physics)|action]]. We assume &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}[\varphi]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[integral]] over ''M'' of a function

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(\varphi,\partial_\mu\varphi,x)&lt;/math&gt;

called the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian density]], depending on φ, its [[derivative]] and the position. In other words, for φ in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S}[\varphi]\,=\,\int_M \mathcal{L}[\varphi(x),\partial_\mu\varphi(x),x] \, \mathrm{d}^nx.&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose we are given [[boundary condition]]s, i.e., a specification of the value of φ at the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] if ''M'' is [[Compact space|compact]], or some limit on φ as ''x'' approaches ∞. Then the [[subspace topology|subspace]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; consisting of functions φ such that all [[functional derivative]]s of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; at φ are zero, that is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta \mathcal{S}[\varphi]}{\delta \varphi(x)}\approx 0&lt;/math&gt;

and that φ satisfies the given boundary conditions, is the subspace of [[on shell]] solutions. (See [[principle of stationary action]])

Now, suppose we have an [[infinitesimal transformation]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, generated by a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]], ''Q'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;Q \left[ \int_N \mathcal{L} \, \mathrm{d}^n x \right] \approx \int_{\partial N} f^\mu [\varphi(x),\partial\varphi,\partial\partial\varphi,\ldots] \, \mathrm{d}s_\mu &lt;/math&gt;

for all compact submanifolds ''N'' or in other words,

:&lt;math&gt;Q[\mathcal{L}(x)]\approx\partial_\mu f^\mu(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x'', where we set

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(x)=\mathcal{L}[\varphi(x), \partial_\mu \varphi(x),x].&lt;/math&gt;

If this holds [[on shell]] and [[off shell]], we say ''Q'' generates an off-shell symmetry. If this only holds [[on shell]], we say ''Q'' generates an on-shell symmetry. Then, we say ''Q'' is a generator of a [[one-parameter group|one parameter]] [[symmetry]] [[Lie group]].

Now, for any ''N'', because of the [[Euler–Lagrange]] theorem, [[on shell]] (and only on-shell), we have

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Q\left[\int_N \mathcal{L} \, \mathrm{d}^nx \right]
&amp; =\int_N \left[\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\varphi} - \partial_\mu \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\varphi)} \right]Q[\varphi] \, \mathrm{d}^nx + \int_{\partial N} \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\varphi)}Q[\varphi] \, \mathrm{d}s_\mu \\
&amp; \approx\int_{\partial N} f^\mu \, \mathrm{d}s_\mu.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since this is true for any ''N'', we have

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu\left[\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\varphi)}Q[\varphi]-f^\mu\right]\approx 0.&lt;/math&gt;

But this is the [[continuity equation]] for the current &lt;math&gt;J^\mu&lt;/math&gt; defined by:&lt;ref name=Peskin&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i35LALN0GosC&amp;pg=PA689&amp;dq=weinberg+%22symmetry+%22 |page=18 |author1=Michael E. Peskin |author2=Daniel V. Schroeder |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-201-50397-2 |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;J^\mu\,=\,\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\varphi)}Q[\varphi]-f^\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

which is called the '''Noether current''' associated with the [[symmetry]]. The continuity equation tells us that if we [[Integral|integrate]] this current over a [[space-like]] slice, we get a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]] called the Noether charge (provided, of course, if ''M'' is noncompact, the currents fall off sufficiently fast at infinity).

=== Comments ===
Noether's theorem is an [[on shell]] theorem: it relies on use of the equations of motion—the classical path. It reflects the relation between the boundary conditions and the variational principle. Assuming no boundary terms in the action, Noether's theorem implies that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial N} J^\mu \, \mathrm{d}s_\mu \approx 0~.&lt;/math&gt;

The quantum analogs of Noether's theorem involving expectation values, e.g. ⟨∫''d''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''x'' ∂·''J''⟩&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, probing [[off shell]] quantities as well are the [[Ward–Takahashi identity|Ward–Takahashi identities]].

=== Generalization to Lie algebras ===
Suppose we have two symmetry derivations ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, [''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] is also a symmetry derivation. Let's see this explicitly. Let's say

:&lt;math&gt;Q_1[\mathcal{L}]\approx\partial_\mu f_1^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;Q_2[\mathcal{L}]\approx\partial_\mu f_2^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

Then,

:&lt;math&gt;[Q_1,Q_2][\mathcal{L}]=Q_1[Q_2[\mathcal{L}]]-Q_2[Q_1[\mathcal{L}]]\approx\partial_\mu f_{12}^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;]&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;]. So,

:&lt;math&gt;j_{12}^\mu=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu\varphi)}\mathcal{L}\right)(Q_1[Q_2[\varphi]]-Q_2[Q_1[\varphi]])-f_{12}^\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

This shows we can extend Noether's theorem to larger Lie algebras in a natural way.

=== Generalization of the proof ===
This applies to ''any'' local symmetry derivation ''Q'' satisfying ''QS''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;0, and also to more general local functional differentiable actions, including ones where the Lagrangian depends on higher derivatives of the fields. Let ''ε'' be any arbitrary smooth function of the spacetime (or time) manifold such that the closure of its support is disjoint from the boundary. ''ε''&amp;nbsp;is a [[test function]]. Then, because of the variational principle (which does ''not'' apply to the boundary, by the way), the derivation distribution q generated by ''q''[''ε''][Φ(''x'')] = ''ε''(''x'')''Q''[Φ(''x'')] satisfies ''q''[''ε''][''S'']&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;0 for every&amp;nbsp;''ε'', or more compactly, ''q''(''x'')[''S'']&amp;nbsp;≈ 0&amp;nbsp;for all ''x'' not on the boundary (but remember that ''q''(''x'') is a shorthand for a derivation ''distribution'', not a derivation parametrized by ''x'' in general). This is the generalization of Noether's theorem.

To see how the generalization is related to the version given above, assume that the action is the spacetime integral of a Lagrangian that only depends on φ and its first derivatives. Also, assume

:&lt;math&gt;Q[\mathcal{L}]\approx\partial_\mu f^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

Then,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
q[\varepsilon][\mathcal{S}] &amp; = \int q[\varepsilon][\mathcal{L}] \, \mathrm{d}^n x  \\
&amp; = \int \left\{ \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \varphi}\mathcal{L}\right) \varepsilon Q[\varphi]+ \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu \varphi)}\mathcal{L}\right]\partial_\mu(\varepsilon Q[\varphi]) \right\} \, \mathrm{d}^n x \\
&amp; = \int \left\{ \varepsilon Q[\mathcal{L}] + \partial_{\mu}\varepsilon \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial \left( \partial_\mu \varphi\right)} \mathcal{L} \right] Q[\varphi] \right\} \, \mathrm{d}^n x \\
&amp; \approx \int \varepsilon \partial_\mu \left\{f^\mu-\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu\varphi)}\mathcal{L}\right]Q[\varphi]\right\} \, \mathrm{d}^n x
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''ε''.

More generally, if the Lagrangian depends on higher derivatives, then

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\partial_\mu\left[f^\mu-\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu\varphi)} \mathcal{L} \right] \right. &amp; \left.\!\! Q[\varphi] - 2\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu \partial_\nu \varphi)}\mathcal{L}\right]\partial_\nu Q[\varphi] \right. \\[6pt]
&amp; \left. {} + \partial_\nu\left[\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu \partial_\nu \varphi)}\mathcal{L}\right] Q[\varphi]\right]-\,\cdots\right]\approx 0.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Example 1: Conservation of energy ===
Looking at the specific case of a Newtonian particle of mass ''m'', coordinate ''x'', moving under the influence of a potential ''V'', coordinatized by time ''t''. The [[Action (physics)|action]], ''S'', is:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathcal{S}[x] &amp; = \int L[x(t),\dot{x}(t)] \, dt \\
&amp; = \int \left(\frac m 2 \sum_{i=1}^3\dot{x}_i^2-V(x(t))\right) \, dt.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first term in the brackets is the [[kinetic energy]] of the particle, whilst the second is its [[potential energy]]. Consider the generator of [[time translation]]s ''Q'' = ''d/dt''. In other words, &lt;math&gt;Q[x(t)]=\dot{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that ''x'' has an explicit dependence on time, whilst ''V'' does not; consequently:

:&lt;math&gt;Q[L]=m \sum_i\dot{x}_i\ddot{x}_i-\sum_i\frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x_i}\dot{x}_i = \frac{d}{dt}\left[\frac{m}{2}\sum_i\dot{x}_i^2-V(x)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

so we can set

:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{m}{2} \sum_i\dot{x}_i^2-V(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Then,

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
j &amp; = \sum_{i=1}^3\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}_i}Q[x_i]-L \\
&amp; = m \sum_i\dot{x}_i^2 -\left[\frac{m}{2}\sum_i\dot{x}_i^2 -V(x)\right] \\
&amp; = \frac{m}{2}\sum_i\dot{x}_i^2+V(x).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The right hand side is the energy, and Noether's theorem states that &lt;math&gt;\dot{j}=0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the principle of conservation of energy is a consequence of invariance under time translations.

More generally, if the Lagrangian does not depend explicitly on time, the quantity

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}_i}\dot{x_i}-L&lt;/math&gt;

(called the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]]) is conserved.

=== Example 2: Conservation of center of momentum ===
Still considering 1-dimensional time, let

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathcal{S}[\vec{x}] &amp; = \int \mathcal{L}[\vec{x}(t),\dot{\vec{x}}(t)] \, \mathrm{d}t \\
&amp; = \int \left [\sum^N_{\alpha=1} \frac{m_\alpha}{2}(\dot{\vec{x}}_\alpha)^2 -\sum_{\alpha&lt;\beta} V_{\alpha\beta}(\vec{x}_\beta-\vec{x}_\alpha)\right] \, \mathrm{d}t
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. ''N'' Newtonian particles where the potential only depends pairwise upon the relative displacement.

For &lt;math&gt;\vec{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, let's consider the generator of Galilean transformations (i.e. a change in the frame of reference). In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;Q_i[x^j_\alpha(t)]=t \delta^j_i. &lt;/math&gt;

Note that

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Q_i[\mathcal{L}] &amp; = \sum_\alpha m_\alpha \dot{x}_\alpha^i-\sum_{\alpha&lt;\beta}\partial_i V_{\alpha\beta}(\vec{x}_\beta-\vec{x}_\alpha)(t-t) \\
&amp; = \sum_\alpha m_\alpha \dot{x}_\alpha^i.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This has the form of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\sum_\alpha m_\alpha x^i_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; so we can set

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{f}=\sum_\alpha m_\alpha \vec{x}_\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

Then,

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{j}=\sum_\alpha \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \dot{\vec{x}}_\alpha}\mathcal{L}\right)\cdot\vec{Q}[\vec{x}_\alpha]-\vec{f}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;=\sum_\alpha (m_\alpha \dot{\vec{x}}_\alpha t-m_\alpha \vec{x}_\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\vec{P}t-M\vec{x}_{CM}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec{P}&lt;/math&gt; is the total momentum, ''M'' is the total mass and &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}_{CM}&lt;/math&gt; is the center of mass. Noether's theorem states:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\vec{j}} = 0 \Rightarrow {\vec{P}}-M \dot{\vec{x}}_{CM} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example 3: Conformal transformation ===

Both examples 1 and 2 are over a 1-dimensional manifold (time). An example involving spacetime is a [[conformal transformation]] of a massless real scalar field with a [[Quartic interaction|quartic potential]] in (3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-[[Minkowski spacetime]].

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathcal{S}[\varphi] &amp; =\int \mathcal{L}[\varphi (x),\partial_\mu \varphi (x)] \, \mathrm{d}^4x \\
&amp; =\int \left( \frac{1}{2}\partial^\mu \varphi \partial_\mu \varphi -\lambda \varphi^4\right ) \, \mathrm{d}^4x
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For ''Q'', consider the generator of a spacetime rescaling. In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;Q[\varphi(x)]=x^\mu\partial_\mu \varphi(x)+\varphi(x). &lt;/math&gt;

The second term on the right hand side is due to the "conformal weight" of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. Note that

:&lt;math&gt;Q[\mathcal{L}]=\partial^\mu\varphi\left(\partial_\mu\varphi+x^\nu\partial_\mu\partial_\nu\varphi+\partial_\mu\varphi\right)-4\lambda\varphi^3\left(x^\mu\partial_\mu\varphi+\varphi\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This has the form of

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu\left[\frac{1}{2}x^\mu\partial^\nu\varphi\partial_\nu\varphi-\lambda x^\mu \varphi^4 \right] = \partial_\mu\left(x^\mu\mathcal{L}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

(where we have performed a change of dummy indices) so set

:&lt;math&gt;f^\mu=x^\mu\mathcal{L}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
j^\mu &amp; =\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial
(\partial_\mu\varphi)}\mathcal{L}\right]Q[\varphi]-f^\mu \\
&amp; =\partial^\mu\varphi\left(x^\nu\partial_\nu\varphi+\varphi\right)-x^\mu\left( \frac 1 2 \partial^\nu\varphi\partial_\nu\varphi-\lambda\varphi^4\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Noether's theorem states that &lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu j^\mu = 0 &lt;/math&gt; (as one may explicitly check by substituting the Euler–Lagrange equations into the left hand side).

Note that if one tries to find the [[Ward–Takahashi identity|Ward–Takahashi]] analog of this equation, one runs into a problem because of [[anomaly (physics)|anomalies]].

== Applications ==
Application of Noether's theorem allows physicists to gain powerful insights into any general theory in physics, by just analyzing the various transformations that would make the form of the laws involved invariant. For example:

* the invariance of physical systems with respect to spatial [[translation (physics)|translation]] (in other words, that the laws of physics do not vary with locations in space) gives the law of conservation of [[linear momentum]];
* invariance with respect to [[rotation]] gives the law of conservation of [[angular momentum]];
* invariance with respect to [[time]] translation gives the well-known [[law of conservation of energy]]

In [[quantum field theory]], the analog to Noether's theorem, the [[Ward–Takahashi identity]], yields further conservation laws, such as the conservation of [[electric charge]] from the invariance with respect to a change in the [[phase factor]] of the [[Complex number|complex]] field of the charged particle and the associated [[gauge invariance|gauge]] of the [[electric potential]] and [[vector potential]].

The Noether charge is also used in calculating the [[entropy]] of [[stationary black hole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vivek Iyer |author2=Wald |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.52.4430 |journal=[[Physical Review D]]  |title=A comparison of Noether charge and Euclidean methods for Computing the Entropy of Stationary Black Holes |volume=52 |issue=8 |pages=4430–9 |year=1995 |arxiv=gr-qc/9503052|bibcode = 1995PhRvD..52.4430I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Non Contact Force is a [[force]] which acts on an object without coming physically in contact with it.&lt;ref name="gravity"&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Basics of Physics
|year=2006

|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most familiar example of a non-contact force is [[gravity]], which confers [[weight]].&lt;ref name="gravity"/&gt; In contrast a [[contact force]] is a force applied to a body by another body that ''is'' in contact with it.&lt;ref name="gravity"/&gt;

==Examples==
All four known [[fundamental interaction]]s are non-contact forces:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* [[Gravity]], the force of attraction that exists among all bodies that have [[mass]]. The force exerted on each body by the other through weight is proportional to the mass of the first body times the mass of the second body divided by the square of the distance between them.
* [[Electromagnetism]] is the force that causes the interaction between electrically charged particles; the areas in which this happens are called electromagnetic fields. Examples of this force include: [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]]s, [[infrared]], [[visible light]], [[X-rays]] and [[gamma ray]]s. Electromagnetism mediates all chemical, biological, electrical and electronic processes.
* [[Strong nuclear force]]: Unlike gravity and electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force is a short distance force that takes place between fundamental particles within a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. It is [[electric charge|charge]] independent and acts equally between a [[proton]] and a proton, a [[neutron]] and a neutron, and a proton and a neutron. The strong nuclear force is the strongest force in nature; however, its range is small (acting only over distances of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; m). The strong nuclear force mediates both [[nuclear fission]] and [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactions.
* [[Weak nuclear force]]: The weak nuclear force mediates the [[beta decay|β decay]] of a neutron, in which the neutron [[radioactive decay|decays]] into a proton and in the process emits a [[beta particle|β particle]] and an uncharged particle called a [[neutrino]]. As a result of mediating the β decay process, the weak nuclear force plays a key role in [[supernovae|supernovas]]. Both the strong and weak forces form an important part of [[quantum mechanics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24461">'''Nudge''' is a concept in [[behavioral science]], [[political theory]] and [[behavioral economics]] which proposes [[positive reinforcement]] and indirect suggestions as ways to [[Social influence|influence]] the behavior and [[decision making]] of groups or individuals. Nudging contrasts with other ways to achieve compliance, such as [[education]], [[legislation]] or [[enforcement]]. The concept has influenced British and American politicians. Several nudge units exist around the world at the national level (UK, Germany, Japan and others) as well as at the international level (e.g. [[OECD]], [[World Bank]], [[United Nations|UN]]).

==Definition of a nudge==
[[File:Nudge_Toilet_1.jpg|thumb|Example of a nudge: a housefly painted onto the ceramic of a [[urinal]] in a men's public toilet]]
The first formulation of the term and associated principles was developed in [[cybernetics]] by James Wilk before 1995 and described by Brunel University academic D. J. Stewart as "the art of the nudge" (sometimes referred to as micronudges&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Wilk, J. | year=1999 | chapter=Mind, nature and the emerging science of change: An introduction to metamorphology. | editor1=G. Cornelis|editor2=S. Smets|editor3=J. Van Bendegem | title=EINSTEIN MEETS MAGRITTE: An Interdisciplinary Reflection on Science, Nature, Art, Human Action and Society: Metadebates on science | volume=6 | pages=71–87 | publisher=Springer Netherlands | doi=10.1007/978-94-017-2245-2_6| isbn=978-90-481-5242-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). It also drew on methodological influences from clinical [[psychotherapy]] tracing back to [[Gregory Bateson]], including contributions from [[Milton Erickson]], [[Paul Watzlawick|Watzlawick]], [[John Weakland|Weakland]] and Fisch, and [[Bill O'Hanlon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author1=O'Hanlon, B.|author2=Wilk, J. | year=1987 | title=Shifting contexts : The generation of effective psychotherapy. | publisher=New York, N.Y.: Guilford Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this variant, the nudge is a microtargetted design geared towards a specific group of people, irrespective of the scale of intended intervention.

In 2008, [[Richard Thaler]] and [[Cass Sunstein]]'s book ''[[Nudge (book)|Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness]]'' brought nudge theory to prominence. It also gained a following among US and UK politicians, in the private sector and in [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://www.shponline.co.uk/features-content/full/cpd-article-nudge-nudge-think-think Dr. Jennifer Lunt and Malcolm Staves]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors refer to influencing behaviour without coercion as [[libertarian paternalism]] and the influencers as choice architects.&lt;ref name=speak /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lucidez.pe/economia/richard-thaler-y-el-auge-de-la-economia-conductual-por-marco-carrasco/|title=Richard Thaler y el auge de la Economía Conductual|last=Carrasco-Villanueva|first=Marco|date=2017-10-18|language=es|work=Lucidez|access-date=2018-10-31|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thaler and Sunstein defined their concept as:

{{quote|''A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the [[choice architecture]] that alters people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives. To count as a mere nudge, the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid. Nudges are not mandates. Putting fruit at eye level counts as a nudge. Banning junk food does not.''}}

In this form, drawing on [[behavioral economics]], the nudge is more generally applied to influence behaviour.

One of the most frequently cited examples of a nudge is the etching of the image of a housefly into the men's room [[Urinal|urinals]] at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, which is intended to "improve the aim".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nudge|last = R. Thaler and C. Sunstein.|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A nudge makes it more likely that an individual will make a particular choice, or behave in a particular way, by altering the environment so that automatic cognitive processes are triggered to favour the desired outcome.&lt;ref name="Saghai"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saghai|first1=Yashar|title=Salvaging the concept of nudge|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=2013|volume=39|issue=8|pages=487–93|doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-100727|pmid=23427215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual’s behaviour is not always in alignment with their intentions (termed a [[value-action gap]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common knowledge that humans are not fully rational beings; that is, people will often do something that is not in their own self interest, even when they are aware that their actions are not in their best interest.&lt;ref name="Kosters"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosters|first1=M|last2=Van der Heijden|first2=J|title=From mechanism to virtue: evaluating nudge theory|journal=Evaluation|date=2015|volume=21|issue=3|page=276–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, when hungry, dieters often under-estimate their ability to lose weight, and their intentions to eat healthy can be temporarily weakened until they are satiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nordgren|first1=L.|last2=Van der Pligt|first2=J.|last3=van Harreveld|first3=F.|title=The instability of health cognitions: visceral states influence self-efficacy and related health beliefs|journal=Health Psychology|date=2008|volume=27|issue=6|page=722–727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaler and Sunstein&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nudge|last = R. Thaler and C. Sunstein.|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; describe two distinct systems for processing information as to why people sometimes act against their own self-interest: System 1 is fast, automatic, and highly susceptible to environmental influences; System 2 processing is slow, reflective, and takes into account explicit goals and intentions.&lt;ref name="Saghai"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saghai|first1=Yashar|title=Salvaging the concept of nudge|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=2013|volume=39|issue=8|pages=487–93|doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-100727|pmid=23427215}}&lt;/ref&gt; When situations are overly complex or overwhelming for an individual’s cognitive capacity, or when an individual is faced with time-constraints or other pressures, System 1 processing takes over decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; System 1 processing relies on various judgmental heuristics to make decisions, resulting in faster decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, this can also lead to sub-optimal decisions. In fact, Thaler and Sunstein&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nudge|last = R. Thaler and C. Sunstein.|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; trace maladaptive behaviour to situations in which System 1 processing over-rides an individual’s explicit values and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is well documented that habitual behaviour is resistant to change without a disruption to the environmental cues that trigger that behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudging techniques aim to use judgmental heuristics to our advantage. In other words, a nudge alters the environment so that when heuristic, or System 1, decision-making is used, the resulting choice will be the most positive or desired outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a nudge is switching the placement of junk food in a store, so that fruit and other healthy options are located next to the cash register, while junk food is relocated to another part of the store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kroese|first1=F.|last2=Marchiori|first2=D.|last3=de Ridder|first3=D.|title=Nudging healthy food choices: a field experiment at the train station|journal=Journal of Public Health|date=2016|volume=38|issue=2|page=e133–e137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of nudges==
Nudges are small changes in environment that are easy and inexpensive to implement.&lt;ref name="Saghai"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saghai|first1=Yashar|title=Salvaging the concept of nudge|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=2013|volume=39|issue=8|pages=487–93|doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-100727|pmid=23427215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several different techniques exist for nudging, including defaults, social proof heuristics, and increasing the salience of the desired option.

A default option is the option an individual automatically receives if he or she does nothing. People are more likely to choose a particular option if it is the default option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Pichert &amp; Katsikopoulos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pichert|first1=D.|last2=Katsikopoulos|first2=K.V.|title=Green defaults: information presentation and pro-environmental behavior|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|date=2008|volume=28|page=63–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that a greater number of consumers chose the [[renewable energy]] option for electricity when it was offered as the default option.

A social proof heuristic refers to the tendency for individuals to look at the behavior of other people to help guide their own behavior. Studies have found some success in using social proof heuristics to nudge individuals to make healthier food choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheung|first1=T.|last2=Kroese|first2=F.|last3=Fennis|first3=B.|last4=de Ridder|first4=D.|title=The hunger games: using hunger to promote healthy choices in self-control conflicts|journal=Appetite|date=2017|volume=116|page=401–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an individual’s attention is drawn towards a particular option, that option will become more salient to the individual, and he or she will be more likely to choose to that option.  As an example, in [[snack]] shops at train stations in the Netherlands, consumers purchased more fruit and [[healthy diet|healthy snack]] options when they were relocated next to the cash register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kroese|first1=F.|last2=Marchiori|first2=D.|last3=de Ridder|first3=D.|title=Nudging healthy food choices: a field experiment at the train station|journal=Journal of Public Health|date=2016|volume=38|issue=2|page=e133–e137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application of theory==
In 2008, the United States appointed Sunstein, who helped develop the theory, as administrator of the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]].&lt;ref name=speak&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/aug/22/davidcameron.conservatives|title=Speak 'Nudge': The 10 key phrases from David Cameron's favorite book|author=Andrew Sparrow|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=2008-08-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/article4330267.ece|title=Why Barack Obama and David Cameron are keen to 'nudge' you|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|author=Carol Lewis |date=2009-07-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|title=Nudge, nudge: meet the Cameroons' new guru|publisher=''[[The Spectator]]''|author=James Forsyth|date=2009-07-16|accessdate=2009-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124222449/http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|archivedate=2009-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Notable applications of nudge theory include the formation of the British [[Behavioural Insights Team]] in 2010. It is often called the "Nudge Unit", at the British [[Cabinet Office]], headed by [[David Halpern (psychologist)|David Halpern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/behavioral-insights-team/about#responsibilities|title=About us - Behavioural Insights Team - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] and President [[Barack Obama]] sought to employ nudge theory to advance [[domestic policy]] goals during their terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/first-obama-now-cameron-embraces-nudge-theory-2050127.html|title=First Obama, now Cameron embraces 'nudge theory'|date=12 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the government of New South Wales established a Behavioural Insights community of practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bi.dpc.nsw.gov.au/|title=Behavioural Insights Unit - What's new in the Behavioural Insights Unit|first=corporateName=Department of Premier and Cabinet; address=1 Farrer Place, Sydney, NSW, 2000; contact=+61 2 9228|last=5555|website=bi.dpc.nsw.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudge theory has also been applied to [[business management]] and [[corporate culture]], such as in relation to [[Environment, health and safety|health, safety and environment]] (HSE) and human resources. Regarding its application to HSE, one of the primary goals of nudge is to achieve a "zero accident culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rydermarsh.co.uk/pdfs/SHP.0112.pdf|format=PDF|title=Cast No Shadow|website=Rydermarsh.co.uk|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Leading [[Silicon Valley]] companies are forerunners in applying nudge theory in corporate setting. These companies are using nudges in various forms to increase productivity and happiness of employees. Recently, further companies are gaining interest in using what is called "nudge management" to improve the productivity of their white-collar workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebert|first=Philip|last2=Freibichler|first2=Wolfgang|year=2017|title=Nudge management: applying behavioural science to increase knowledge worker productivity|journal=Journal of Organization Design|volume=6:4|pages=|doi=10.1186/s41469-017-0014-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral insights and nudges are currently used in many countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carrasco-Villanueva |first=Marco |editor=上海社会科学院 [Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences]|title=2016上海青年汉学家研修计划论文集|language=zh|publisher=中国社会科学出版社 [China Social Sciences Press]|date=2016 |pages=368–392 |chapter=中国的环境公共政策：一个行为经济学的选择 [Environmental Public Policies in China: An Opportunity for Behavioral Economics]|isbn=978-1-234-56789-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
Nudging has also been criticised. Tammy Boyce, from public health foundation [[The King's Fund]], has said: "We need to move away from short-term, politically motivated initiatives such as the 'nudging people' idea, which are not based on any good evidence and don't help people make long-term behaviour changes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/unhealthy-lifestyles-here-to-stay-in-spite-of-costly-campaigns-1055693.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Unhealthy lifestyles here to stay, in spite of costly campaigns | first=Nina | last=Lakhani | date=December 7, 2008 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cass Sunstein has responded to critiques at length in his ''The Ethics of Influence''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TlvWDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=ethics+of+influence+sunstein#v=onepage&amp;q=ethics%20of%20influence%20sunstein&amp;f=false|title=The Ethics of Influence: Government in the Age of Behavioral Science|last=Sunstein|first=Cass R.|date=2016-08-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107140707|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the case in favor of nudging against charges that nudges diminish [[autonomy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Christian|date=2015-10-12|title=On the Ethics of Public Nudging: Autonomy and Agency|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2672970|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;, threaten [[dignity]], violate liberties, or reduce [[welfare]]. He further defended nudge theory in his ''Why Nudge?: The Politics of Libertarian Paternalism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Rx3qAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Why Nudge?: The Politics of Libertarian Paternalism|last=Sunstein|first=Cass R.|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300212693|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; by arguing that [[choice architecture]] is inevitable and that some form of paternalism cannot be avoided. Ethicists have debated nudge theory rigorously&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barton|first=Adrien|last2=Grüne-Yanoff|first2=Till|date=2015-09-01|title=From Libertarian Paternalism to Nudging—and Beyond|journal=Review of Philosophy and Psychology|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=341–359|doi=10.1007/s13164-015-0268-x|issn=1878-5158}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These charges have been made by various participants in the debate from Bovens&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Preference Change|last=Bovens|first=Luc|date=2009|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|isbn=9789048125920|series=Theory and Decision Library|pages=207–219|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-90-481-2593-7_10|chapter = The Ethics of Nudge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to Goodwin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Tom|date=2012-06-01|title=Why We Should Reject 'Nudge'|journal=Politics|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=85–92|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9256.2012.01430.x|issn=0263-3957}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Wilkinson for example charges nudges for being manipulative, while others such as Yeung question their scientific credibility&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yeung|first=Karen|date=2012-01-01|title=Nudge as Fudge|journal=The Modern Law Review|language=en|volume=75|issue=1|pages=122–148|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2230.2012.00893.x|issn=1468-2230}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Public opinion on the ethicality of nudges has also been shown to be susceptible to “partisan nudge bias”.&lt;ref name="NT"&gt;[https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/todd_rogers/files/tannenbaum_fox_rogers.2017.pdf Tannenbaum, D., Fox, C. R., &amp; Rogers, T. (2017). On the misplaced politics of behavioural policy interventions. Nature Human Behaviour , 1 (10 July 2017), 1-7.]&lt;/ref&gt; Research from David Tannenbaum, Craig R. Fox, and Todd Rogers (2017) found that adults and policymakers in the United States found behavioral policies to be more ethical when they aligned with their own political leanings.&lt;ref name="NT"/&gt; Conversely, people found these same mechanisms to be more unethical when they differed from their politics.&lt;ref name="NT"/&gt; The researchers also found that nudges are not inherently partisan: when evaluating behavioral policies absent of political cues, people across the political spectrum were alike in their assessments.&lt;ref name="NT"/&gt;

Some, such as Hausman &amp; Welch&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hausman|first=Daniel M.|last2=Welch|first2=Brynn|date=2010-03-01|title=Debate: To Nudge or Not to Nudge*|journal=Journal of Political Philosophy|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=123–136|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9760.2009.00351.x|issn=1467-9760}}&lt;/ref&gt; have inquired whether nudging should be permissible on grounds of (distributive{{clarify|date=February 2018}}) justice; Lepenies &amp; Malecka &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lepenies|first=Robert|last2=Małecka|first2=Magdalena|date=2015-09-01|title=The Institutional Consequences of Nudging – Nudges, Politics, and the Law|journal=Review of Philosophy and Psychology|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=427–437|doi=10.1007/s13164-015-0243-6|issn=1878-5158}}&lt;/ref&gt; have questioned whether nudges are compatible with the rule of law. Similarly, legal scholars have discussed the role of nudges and the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alemanno|first=A.|last2=Spina|first2=A.|date=2014-04-01|title=Nudging legally: On the checks and balances of behavioral regulation|url=https://academic.oup.com/icon/article/12/2/429/710410/Nudging-legally-On-the-checks-and-balances-of|journal=International Journal of Constitutional Law|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=429–456|doi=10.1093/icon/mou033|issn=1474-2640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kemmerer|first=Alexandra|last2=Möllers|first2=Christoph|last3=Steinbeis|first3=Maximilian|last4=Wagner|first4=Gerhard|date=2016-07-15|title=Choice Architecture in Democracies: Exploring the Legitimacy of Nudging - Preface|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2810229|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral economists such as Bob Sugden have pointed out that the underlying normative benchmark of nudging is still [[homo economicus]], despite the proponents' claim to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sugden|first=Robert|date=2017-06-01|title=Do people really want to be nudged towards healthy lifestyles?|journal=International Review of Economics|language=en|volume=64|issue=2|pages=113–123|doi=10.1007/s12232-016-0264-1|issn=1865-1704}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has been remarked that nudging is also a [[euphemism]] for [[psychological manipulation]] as practiced in [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/olin_center/papers/pdf/Sunstein_809.pdf|format=PDF|title=NUDGING AND CHOICE ARCHITECTURE: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS|author=Cass R.

There exists an anticipation and, simultaneously, implicit criticism of the nudge theory in works of Hungarian social psychologists who emphasize the active participation in the nudge of its target (Ferenc Merei)&lt;ref&gt;MÉREI Ferenc (1987): A perem-helyzet egyik változata: a szociálpszichológiai kontúr (A variant of the edge-position: the contour socialpsychological); Pszichológia (1987), 1, pp. 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;, Laszlo Garai&lt;ref&gt;Garai L.

'''''Nulla poena sine lege''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "no penalty without a law") is a [[Law|legal]] principle, requiring that one cannot be punished for doing something that is not prohibited by law. This principle is accepted and codified in modern democratic states as a basic requirement of the [[rule of law]].&lt;ref&gt;A description and analysis of the principle can be found in [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1347126 Shahram Dana, Beyond Retroactivity to Realizing Justice: The Principle of Legality in International Criminal Law Sentencing, 99 JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL LAW AND CRIMINOLOGY 857 (2009) ]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "one of the most 'widely held value-judgement[s] in the entire history of human thought{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] in ''[[Rogers v. Tennessee]]'', citing J. Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law 59 (2d ed. 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
In modern European criminal law, e.g. of the [[Constitutional Court of Germany]], the principle of ''nulla poena sine lege'' has been found to consist of four separate requirements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boot|first=M.|title=Genocide, Crimes Against Humanity, War Crimes: Nullum Crimen Sine Lege and the Subject Matter Jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court|year=2002|publisher=Intersentia|isbn=9789050952163|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6QjrSHfoEiAC&amp;pg=PA94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Nulla poena sine &lt;u&gt;praevia&lt;/u&gt; lege poenali'': There is to be no penalty without ''previous'' law. This prohibits [[ex post facto law]]s, and the retroactive application of criminal law. It is a basic [[Maxim (saying)|maxim]] in [[continental Europe]]an legal thinking. It was written by [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach]] as part of the Bavarian Criminal Code in 1813.

;''Nulla poena sine lege &lt;u&gt;scripta&lt;/u&gt;'': There is to be no penalty without ''written'' law. That is, criminal prohibitions must be set out in written legal instruments of general application, normally [[statute]]s, adopted in the form required by constitutional law. This excludes [[customary law]] as a basis of criminal punishment.

;''Nulla poena sine lege &lt;u&gt;certa&lt;/u&gt;'': There is to be no penalty without ''well-defined'' law. This provides that a penal statute must define the punishable conduct and the penalty with sufficient definiteness to allow citizens to foresee when a specific action would be punishable, and to conduct themselves accordingly. The rule expresses the general principle of [[legal certainty]] in matters of criminal law. It is recognised or codified in many national jurisdictions, as well as e.g. by the [[European Court of Justice]] as a "general principle of [[Law of the European Union|Union law]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klip|first=André|title=Substantive Criminal Law of the European Union|year=2011|publisher=Maklu|isbn=9789046604403|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KrkY5eZ36zAC&amp;pg=PA69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Nulla poena sine lege &lt;u&gt;stricta&lt;/u&gt;'': There is to be no penalty without ''exact'' law. This prohibits the [[Analogy#Law|application by analogy]] of statutory provisions in criminal law.

One complexity is the lawmaking power of judges under [[common law]]. Even in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems that do not admit judge-made law, it is not always clear when the function of interpretation of the criminal law ends and judicial lawmaking begins.

In [[English criminal law]] there are offences of [[common law]] origin. For example, [[murder]] is still a [[common law offence]] and lacks a statutory definition. The [[Homicide Act 1957]] did not include a statutory definition of murder (or any other homicidal offense). Therefore, the definition of murder was the subject of no fewer than six appeals to the House of Lords within the next 40 years (''Director of Public Prosecutions v. Smith'' [1961] A.C. 290; ''Hyam v. Director of Public Prosecutions'' [1975] A.C. 55; ''Regina v. Cunningham'' [1982] A.C. 566; ''Regina v. Moloney'' [1985] A.C. 905; ''Regina v. Hancock'' [1986] A.C. 455; ''Regina v. Woollin'' [1998] 4 A11 E.R. 103 (H.L.)).

== In natural law ==
The legal principle ''nulla poena sine lege'' as principle in natural law is due to the contention of scholars of the [[Scholasticism]] about the preconditions of a guilty conscience. In relation to the [[Ezekiel]]-commentary of [[Jerome|Sophronius Eusebius Hieronymus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Patrologiae cursus completus {{!}} sive bibliotheca universalis, integra, uniformis, commoda, oeconomica, omnium ss. patrum, doctorum scriptorum que ecclesiasticorum qui ab aevo apostolico ad usque Innocentii III tempora floruerunt (...)

(…) Excudebat Migne (...).|last=Hieronymus|first=Sophronius Eusebius|publisher=|year=1884|isbn=|location=|pages=col. 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Francisco Suárez]] analysed the formal conditions of the punishment of [[conscience]]. Thomas located the conditions within the [[Synderesis|synderesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Summa Theologiae Ia|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=q. LXXIX art. XII. resp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him it is a formal and active part of the human soul. Understanding of activity, which is in accordance with the human nature, is formal possible due to the synderesis. Hence the synderesis contains in the works of patristic authors a law which commands how the human as human has to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Patrologiae cursus completus {{!}} sive bibliotheca universalis, integra, uniformis, commoda, oeconomica, omnium ss. patrum, doctorum scriptorum que ecclesiasticorum qui ab aevo apostolico ad tempora concilii tridentini pro latinis et cconcilii florentini pro graecis floruerunt (...) Series Graeca Prior, accurante J.-P. Migne, Patrologiae Graecae Tomus XCIV. S. Joannes Damascenus (…) Excudebat Migne.|last=Damascenus|first=Joannes|publisher=|year=1864|isbn=|location=|pages=col. 1199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the individual case this law is contentual definite. For the scholastic this is shown in the action of the intellect. This action is named since Thomas ''conscientia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Summa Theologiae Ia|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=q.LXXIX a.XIII. resp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible content of the ''conscientia'' is the punishment in concordance with the content of the synderesis, in case the human has had not act in concordance with the human nature. An example for the punishment is madness, which since antiquity is a punishment of conscience. The [[Oresteia]] is a famous example for this.

According Suárez the punishment of conscience is the insight in an obligation to act in concordance with the human nature to undo a past misdeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Suárez, Opera Omnia. Editio nova, A D. M. André, Canonico Repullensi ,(...) Thomus Quartus. Parisiis: Ludovicum Vivès, Tractatus Tertius. De bonitate et malitia humanorum actuum.|last=Suárez|first=Francisco|publisher=|year=1865|isbn=|location=|pages=Disputatio XII. Sectio II. n.1, 439.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This insight obligates to impossible actions due to the fact that the misdeed is in the past and hence it is unchangeable. Therefore the ''conscientia'' obligates in concordance with the synderesis to do an impossible action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=De bonitate et malitia humanorum actuum.|last=Suárez|first=Francisco|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Disputatio XII. sectio IV. n.729–35, 445.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the ''conscientia'' restricts conscientious persons by doing a limitation on their own will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Summa Theologiae Ia|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=q. XLVIII. Art. V. resp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For they are unable to think about any other action than to fulfil their obligation. Inasmuch the conscientia restricts the intellect the scholastic speak of it as a ''malum'' or ''malum metaphysicum'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Summa Theologiae Ia|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=q. XLVIII. Art. V. resp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the limitation is related to a metaphysical quality of a human. The law is constituted by the human nature itself from what the ''malum metaphysicum'' is inflicted. Therefore the punishment of the conscience is executed because of a violation of [[natural law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simmert|first=Sebastian|date=2016|title=Nulla poena sine lege. Etiam sine lege poena est conscientia.|url=|journal=Rechtsphilosophie - Zeitschrift für Grundlagen des Rechts.|volume=3|pages=283–304|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In cases of universal jurisdiction==
The question of [[jurisdiction]] may sometimes come to contradict this principle. For example, [[customary international law]] allows the prosecution of [[pirate]]s by any country (applying [[universal jurisdiction]]), even if they did not commit crimes at the area that falls under this country's law. A similar principle has appeared in the recent decades with regard to crimes of [[genocide]] (see [[genocide#Genocide as a crime under domestic law|genocide as a crime under domestic law]]); and [[UN Security Council Resolution 1674]] "reaffirms the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 [[World Summit Outcome Document]] regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity"&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/e529762befa456f8852571610045ebef!OpenDocument Resolution 1674 (2006)]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223154915/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/e529762befa456f8852571610045ebef!OpenDocument |date=February 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; even if the State in which the population is being assaulted does not recognise these assaults as a breach of domestic law. However, it seems that universal jurisdiction is not to be expanded substantially to other crimes, so as to satisfy ''Nulla poena sine lege''.

Since the [[Nuremberg Trials]], [[penal law]] is taken to include the prohibitions of international criminal law, in addition to those of [[domestic law]]. The [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1347126 normative content of nulla poena] in international law is developed by Shahram Dana in "Beyond Retroactivity to Realizing Justice: The Principle of Legality in International Criminal Law Sentencing" published in 99 JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL LAW AND CRIMINOLOGY 857 (2009).  Thus, prosecutions have been possible of such individuals as [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[war criminal]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Nuremberg Principles]] I &amp; II state; "Any person who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefore and liable to punishment." and "The fact that internal law does not impose a penalty for an act which constitutes a crime under international law does not relieve the person who committed the act from responsibility under international law" respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; and officials of the [[German Democratic Republic]] responsible for the [[Berlin Wall]],&lt;ref&gt;Case of Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v. Germany (Applications nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98) (2001) 33 E.H.R.R. 31&lt;/ref&gt; even though their deeds may have been allowed or even ordered by domestic law. Also, courts when dealing with such cases will tend to look to the letter of the law at the time, even in regimes where the law as it was written was generally disregarded in practice by its own authors.

However, some legal scholars criticize this, because generally, in the legal systems of Continental Europe where the maxim was first developed, "penal law" was taken to mean [[Statutory law|statutory]] penal law, so as to create a guarantee to the individual, considered as a fundamental right, that he would not be prosecuted for an action or omission that was not considered a crime according to the statutes passed by the legislators in force at the time of the action or omission, and that only those penalties that were in place when the infringement took place would be applied. Also, even if one considers that certain actions are prohibited under general principles of international law, critics point out that a prohibition in a general principle does not amount to the establishment of a crime, and that the rules of international law also do not stipulate specific penalties for the violations.

In an attempt to address those criticisms, the statute of the recently established [[International Criminal Court]] provides for a system in which crimes and penalties are expressly set out in written law, that shall only be applied to future cases.

This principle is enshrined in several national constitutions, and a number of international instruments. See e.g. [[European Convention on Human Rights]], article 7(1); Rome Statute of the [[International Criminal Court]], articles 22 and 23.&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite journal|last=Popple|first=James|author-link=James Popple|title=The right to protection from retroactive criminal law|year=1989|journal=Criminal Law Journal|volume=13|number=4|pages=251–62|issn=0314-1160|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~James.Popple/publications/articles/retroactive/clj.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=no|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In computing, a '''one-pass algorithm''' is a [[streaming algorithm]] which reads its input exactly once, in order, without unbounded [[Buffer (computer science)|buffering]].  A one-pass algorithm generally requires O(n) (see [[Big O Notation|'big O' notation]]) time and less than O(n) storage (typically O(1)), where n is the size of the input.

Basically one-pass algorithm operates as follows:
(1) the object descriptions are processed serially;
(2) the first object becomes the cluster representative of the first cluster;
(3) each subsequent object is matched against all cluster representatives existing at
its  processing time;
(4) a given object is assigned to one cluster (or more if overlap is allowed) according
to  some condition on the matching function;
(5) when an object is  assigned to a cluster the representative for that cluster is
recomputed;
(6) if an object fails a certain test it becomes the cluster representative of  a new
cluster (7) nothing happened
==Example problems solvable by one-pass algorithms==
Given any list as an input:
* Count the number of elements.
* Find the ''n''th element (or report that the list has fewer than ''n'' elements).
* Find the ''n''th element from the end (or report that the list has fewer than ''n'' elements).

Given a list of numbers:
* Find the ''k'' largest or smallest elements, ''k'' given in advance.
* Find the [[summation|sum]], [[mean]], [[variance]] and [[standard deviation]] of the elements of the list.

Given a list of symbols from an alphabet of ''k'' symbols, given in advance.
* Count the number of times each symbol appears in the input.
* Find the most or least frequent elements.
* Sort the list according to some order on the symbols (possible since the number of symbols is limited).
* Find the maximum gap between two appearances of a given symbol.

==Example problems not solvable by one-pass algorithms==
Given any list as an input:
* Find the middle element of the list.

Given a list of numbers:
* Find the [[median]].
* Find the [[mode (statistics)|modes]] (This is not the same is finding the most frequent symbol from a limited alphabet).
* Sort the list.

* [[Beat 'em up]] &amp;ndash;  a video game genre featuring melee combat between the protagonist and a large number of underpowered antagonists.
* [[Fighting game]] &amp;ndash;  a genre where the player controls an on-screen character and engages in close combat with an opponent.
* [[Platform game]] &amp;ndash;  requires the player to control a character to jump to and from suspended platforms or over obstacles (jumping puzzles).
* [[Shooter game]] &amp;ndash;  wide subgenre that focuses on using some sort of weapon often testing the player's speed and reaction time.
** [[First-person shooter]] &amp;ndash;  a video game genre that centers the gameplay on gun and projectile weapon-based combat through first-person perspective; i.e., the player experiences the action through the eyes of a protagonist.
** [[Light gun shooter]] &amp;ndash;  a genre in which the primary design element is aiming and shooting with a gun-shaped controller.

'''Peace war game''' is an [[iterated game]] originally played in academic groups and by [[computer simulation]] for years to study possible strategies of [[cooperation]] and [[aggression]].&lt;ref&gt;Shy, O., 1996, ''[[industrial organization|Industrial Organization]]: Theory and Applications'', Cambridge, Mass.: The [[MIT]] Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As peace makers became richer over time it became clear that making war had greater costs than initially anticipated. The only [[strategy]] that acquired wealth more rapidly was a "[[Genghis Khan]]", a constant aggressor making war continually to gain resources. This led to the development of the "provokable nice guy" [[strategy]], a peace-maker until attacked.&lt;ref&gt;N.R. Miller, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/4235437 "Nice Strategies Finish First: A Review of ''The Evolution of Cooperation''"], ''[[Politics and the Life Sciences]]'', [[Association for Politics and the Life Sciences]], 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple players continue to gain wealth cooperating with each other while bleeding the constant aggressor. The [[Hanseatic League]] for trade and mutual defense appears to have originated from just such concerns about [[Hanseatic_League#History|seaborne raiders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balticconnections.net/views/exhibition/detail.cfm?mode=language&amp;ID=18CEDA3F-D929-4A8E-E777F313AC7EB8E4 |title=Agreement of the Hanseatic League at Lübeck, 1557 |publisher=Baltic Connections |accessdate=16 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peace war game is a variation of the [[iterated prisoner's dilemma]] in which the decisions ([[Cooperation|Cooperate]], [[Defection|Defect]]) are replaced by ([[Peace]], [[War]]). Strategies remain the same with [[reciprocal altruism]], "[[Tit for Tat]]", or "provokable nice guy" as the best [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] one. This strategy is simply to make peace on the first iteration of the [[game]]; after that, the player does what his opponent did on the previous move. A slightly better strategy is "Tit for Tat with forgiveness". When the opponent makes war, on the next move, the player sometimes makes peace anyway, with a small probability. This allows an escape from wasting cycles of retribution, a motivation similar to the [[Rule of ko|Rule of Ko]] in the game of [[Go (board game)|Go]]. "Tit for Tat with forgiveness" is best when miscommunication is introduced, when one's move is incorrectly reported to the opponent. A typical [[payoff matrix]] for two players (A, B) of one iteration of this [[game]] is:
	 
:{| border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"
	 
|-
	 
! A.. B:
	 
! [[Peace]]
	 
! [[War]]
	 
|-
	 
! [[Peace]]
	 
| ( 2, 2)
	 
| ( 0, 3)
	 
|-
	 
! [[War]]
	 
| ( 3, 0)
	 
| ( 1, 1)
	 
|}
	 
Here a player's resources have a value of 2, half of which must be spent to wage war. In this case, there exists a [[Nash equilibrium]], a mutually best response for a single iteration, here (War, War), by definition heedless of consequences in later iterations. "Provokable nice guy's" [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimality]] depends on iterations. How many are necessary is likely tied to the payoff matrix and [[probabilities]] of choosing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wam.umd.edu/~lindag/econ460/Lecture1.ppt Industrial Organization] - [[economics]] lecture in which the [[Peace]] [[War]] [[Game]] is an example.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[subgame perfect]] version of this strategy is "Contrite Tit-for-Tat" which is to make peace unless one is in "good standing" and one's opponent is not. Good ("standing" assumed) means to make peace with good opponents, make peace when bad, or make war when good and opponent is not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Gintis]], ''Game Theory Evolving: A Problem-centered Introduction to Modeling Strategic Behavior'', [[Princeton University Press]], 2000, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

'''People's Union for Democratic Rights''' is an organisation based in Delhi which is committed to legally defend "[[Civil liberties#India|civil liberties]] and [[Civil and political rights|democratic rights]]" of the people.&lt;ref name="PUDR"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us |url=http://www.pudr.org/?q=content/about-us |publisher=PUDR |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The People's Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR) is an independent entity and is not affiliated to any [[political party]] or organisation.&lt;ref name="Constitution"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Constitution of People's Union for Democratic Rights |url=http://www.unipune.ac.in/snc/cssh/HumanRights/11%20HUMAN%20RIGHTS%20ORGANISATION'S%20DOCUMENTS/16.pdf |publisher=[[University of Pune]] |format=PDF |date=December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|PUCL#Background|l1=Background of the PUCL}}
The PUDR was initially formed as the Delhi's unit of the ''People's Union for Civil Liberties and Democratic Rights'' (PUCLDR) in 1977, but the PUCLDR discontinued its activities after the [[Indian general election, 1977|Janata Party's success in the elections]], while the PUDR continued to work. The national forum (PUCLDR) was later revived in 1980, but in a "new form" and with a new name, [[PUCL]], creating a dichotomous bisection between civil liberties and democratic rights. Later in February 1981, the PUDR opted to function as a separate organisation.&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt;

==Aims and objectives==
* "To protect, extend and help implement the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution and to make people aware of the same."
* "To work towards making the [[Directive Principles of State Policy]] enforceable and justiciable."
* "To build public opinion towards the ratification and enforcement by the Indian government of the [[Human rights#United Nations Charter|United Nations Charter of Human Rights]], [[International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights]], [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and other such covenants and charters."
* "To defend and help democratic struggles against [[Discrimination#Caste|caste]], class, [[Communalism|community]], [[Ethnic expulsion|ethnicity]], [[Religious oppression|religion]] and [[Gender discrimination|gender]] based oppression."&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt;

==Organisation structure==
The PUDR has an executive committee that is constituted of 7 members that includes two secretaries and a [[treasurer]]. The executive committee is elected every year during the ''Annual General Body Meeting'' by the [[Secret ballot]]. Every member of the PUDR is a part of its ''General Body.''&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt; The secretaries of the PUDR in 2013 were Asish Gupta&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Civil liberty body People's Union for Democratic Rights accuses Maruti of violating workers' rights |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-05-23/news/39475801_1_haryana-labour-maruti-management-democratic-rights |agency=[[Press Trust of India]] |newspaper=The Economic Times |date=23 May 2013 |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and D.

==Membership==
The PUDR's membership is accorded only to the individuals and is not granted to organisations, based on the precondition that the member concur to the aims and objectives of the PUDR, and would "work actively and support the programme" of the PUDR. The applicants are required to get their membership application approved by the executive committee which thereafter has to be renewed annually. The membership fee per year is {{INR}} 10.&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt;

==Funding==
The PUDR raises funds for itself by "income received from sale of its literature, membership fee, and donations received from members and sympathisers from time to time;" and does not obtains money from the government, institutions, or political parties. It does not take any financial aid from any source in other countries as well.&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt; The members of the PUDR work as [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s and are not given any payment for their time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Constitution of People's Union for Democratic Rights |url=http://www.pudr.org/?q=content/constitution-peoples-union-democratic-rights |publisher=PUDR |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''perceptual paradox''' illustrates the failure of a theoretical prediction.  [[Theory|Theories]] of [[perception]] are supposed to help a researcher predict what will be perceived when [[sense]]s are stimulated.

A theory usually comprises a [[mathematical model]] (formula),
rules for collecting physical measurements for input into the model,
and rules for collecting physical measurements to which model outputs should map.  When arbitrarily choosing valid input data, the model should reliably generate output data that is indistinguishable from that which is measured in the system being modeled.

Although each theory may be useful for some limited predictions,
theories of vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste are not typically
reliable for comprehensive modeling of perception based on sensory inputs.  A paradox illustrates where a theoretical prediction fails.
Sometimes, even in the absence of a predictive theory,
the characteristics of perception seem nonsensical.

This page lists some paradoxes and seemingly impossible properties of perception.  When an animal is not named in connection with the discussion, human perception should be assumed since
the majority of perceptual research data applies to humans.

== Terminology ==

;&lt;math&gt;SUN_{white}&lt;/math&gt; light: Normal white sunlight is black-body radiation containing a broad and largely featureless spectrum covering the entire range of human vision.
;&lt;math&gt;RGB_{white}&lt;/math&gt; light: Televisions and computer screens ''fool'' the eye by generating photons of three narrow wavelength bands where the proportion of photons from industry standard (but improperly named) [[RGB color model|R ''(red)'', G ''(green)'', and B ''(blue)'']] sources is known to be perceived as white.

== Definition ==

A [[Perception|perceptual]] [[paradox]], in its purest form is a statement
illustrating the failure of a formula to predict
what we perceive from what our [[sense]]s [[Transducer|transduce]].

{| border="1"
|Example: standard [[information theory]] limits [[spatial frequency]] based [[Hyperacuity (scientific term)|hyperacuity]] to a factor of approximately 4 over the spatial frequency of [[photoreceptor cell]]s.  Yet, reliable scientific journals have published reports of hyperacuity in excess of a factor of 10.
|}

A seemingly nonsensical characteristic is a statement of factual observation
that is sufficiently intractable that no theory has been proposed to account for it.

{| border="1"
|Example: the [[optical path]] in an eye, from the [[cornea]] to the photoreceptors, goes through a non-spherical cornea and lens that refract and non-circular apertures that diffract such that, in a normal eye, the image on the retina for a point-source is an irregular color-fringed, color-eccentric coaxial bullseye-like pattern with many pathological properties, with the central bright feature covering many photoreceptors.&lt;ref name=Roorda&gt;Roorda, A. “A Review of Optics” chapter 2 in Wavefront Customized Visual Correction: The Quest for SuperVision  II. (Macrae, S.M., Krueger, R.R., Applegate, R.A., ed). Slack Inc. Thorofare, NJ (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, the point-source is perceived clearly, and can be discriminated from other such points as little distance away as 1/10 the visual angle of a photoreceptor.  According to Roorda, in a "perfect" eye, a foveal cone subtends 30 arcseconds, and the diameter of the central "Airy" disk varies between 10 cones (1mm pupil used for reading) to about 1.5 cones (8mm pupil used during fight/flight response).
|}

== Mathematical modeling ==

One branch of research into [[perception]] attempts to explain
what we perceive by applying formulae to [[Sense|sensory]] inputs
and expecting outputs similar to that which we perceive.
For example: what we measure with our eyes should be predicted
by applying formulae to what we measure with instruments that imitate our eye.

Past researchers have made formulae that predict
some, but not all, perceptual phenomena from their sensory origins.
Modern researchers continue to make formulae to overcome
the shortcomings of earlier formulae.

Some formulae are carefully constructed to mimic
actual structures and functions of sensory mechanisms.
Other formulae are constructed by great leaps of faith
about similarity in mathematical curves.

No perceptual formulae have been raised to the status of "natural law"
in the way that the laws of gravitation and electrical attraction have.
So, perceptual formulae continue to be an active area of development
as scientists strive towards the great insight required of a law.

== History ==

Some [[Nobel laureate]]s have paved the way with clear statements of good practice:

In the preface to his Histology
&lt;ref name=Cajal&gt;Histology of the Nervous System: Spanish edition&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]]
wrote that "Practitioners will only be able to claim that a valid explanation of a [[Histology|histological observation]] has been provided if three questions can be answered satisfactorily: what is the functional role of the arrangement in the animal; what mechanisms underlie this function; and what sequence of chemical and mechanical events during [[evolution]] and development gave rise to these mechanisms?"

[[Allvar Gullstrand]] described the problems that arise
when approaching the optics of the eye as if they were as predictable as camera optics.

[[Charles Scott Sherrington]], considered the brain to be
the "crowning achievement of the reflex system",
(which can be interpreted as opening all aspects of perception to simple formulae
expressed over complex distributions).

'''Contrast Invariance'''&lt;br /&gt;
Boundaries between brighter and darker areas
appear to remain of constant relative contrast
when the ratio of logarithms of the two intensities
remains constant:

 &lt;math&gt;Contrast \propto \frac{log I_a}{log I_b}&lt;/math&gt;

But the use of logarithms is forbidden
for values that can become zero such as &lt;math&gt;I_a\,&lt;/math&gt;,
and division is forbidden
by values that can become zero such as &lt;math&gt;log I_b\,&lt;/math&gt;.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception
of contrast invariance.

'''10 Decade Transduction'''

'''Local Contrast'''

'''Color Constancy'''&lt;br /&gt;
When observing objects in a scene, colors appears constant.
An apple looks red regardless of where it is viewed.
In bright direct sunshine, under a blue sky with the sun obscured,
during a colorful sunset, under a canopy of green leaves,
and even under most man-made light sources,
the color of the apple remains unchanging.

Color perception appears to be independent of light wavelength.
[[Edwin Land]] demonstrated this by illuminating a room with
two wavelengths of light of approximately 500&amp;nbsp;nm and 520&amp;nbsp;nm
(both improperly called "green").
The room was perceived in full color,
with all colors appearing unattenuated,
like red, orange, yellow, blue, and purple,
despite the absence of photons other than two close to 510&amp;nbsp;nm.
Note that &lt;math&gt;RGB_{white}&lt;/math&gt; light misuses the terminology RGB
since color is a perception and
there are no such things as ''Red'', ''Green'', or ''Blue'' photons.

[[Jerome Lettvin]] wrote an article in the Scientific American
&lt;ref name="Lettvin"&gt;1986 The colors of things, Scientific American, Vol.255.3, pp. 84-91; (with Brou, Philippe, Sciascia, and Linden)&lt;/ref&gt;
illustrating the importance of boundaries and vertices
in the perception of color.

Yet, no published formula predicts the perceived color of objects
in a single image of arbitrary scene illumination.

'''Transverse Chromatic Deaberration'''&lt;br /&gt;
Light that goes through a simple lens such as found in an eye
undergoes refraction, splitting colors.
An &lt;math&gt;RGB_{white}&lt;/math&gt; point-source that is off-center to the eye
projects to a pattern where with color separation along a line radial to
the central axis of the eye.
The color separation can be many photoreceptors wide.

Yet, an &lt;math&gt;RGB_{white}&lt;/math&gt; pixel on a television or computer screen appears white
even when seen sidelong.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception of
the eccentric white pixel.

'''Longitudinal Chromatic Deaberration'''&lt;br /&gt;
As in Transverse Chromatic Deaberration,
color splitting projects also projects the R, G, and B components
of the &lt;math&gt;RGB_{white}&lt;/math&gt; pixel to different focal lengths,
resulting in a bulls-eye-like color distribution of light
even at the center of vision.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception of
the centered white pixel.

'''Spherical Deaberration'''&lt;br /&gt;
Eyes have corneas and lenses that are imperfectly spherical.
This inhomogeneous shape results in a non-circular distribution of photons on the retina.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception of
the non-circularly distributed white pixel.

'''Hyperacuity'''&lt;br /&gt;
People report discrimination much finer than can be predicted
by interpolating sense data between photosensors.
High performing hyperacute vision in some people
has been measured to less than a tenth the radius of a single photoreceptor.
Among measures of hyperacuity are the vernier discrimination of two adjacent lines
and the discrimination of two stars in a night sky.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts the discrimination of
the two white pixels closer together than a single photoreceptor.

'''Pupil Size Inversion'''&lt;br /&gt;
When pupils are narrowed to around 1mm for reading fine print,
the size of the central "Airy" disk increases to a diameter of 10 photoreceptors.
The so-called "blur" is increased for reading.
When pupils are widened for fight/flight response,
the size of the central "Airy" disk decreases to a diameter of about 1.5 photoreceptors.
The so-called "blur" is decreased in anticipation of large movements.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts that discrimination
improves when pupils are narrowed.

'''Pupil Shape Inversion'''&lt;br /&gt;
Eyes have pupils (apertures) that cause diffraction.
A point-source of light is distributed on the retina.
The distribution for a perfectly circular aperture
is known by the name "Airy rings".

Human pupils are rarely perfectly circular.
Cat pupils range from almost circular to a vertical slit.
Goat pupils tend to be horizontal rectangular with rounded corners.
Gecko pupils range from circular, to a slit, to a series of pinholes.
Cuttlefish pupils have complex shapes.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception of
the various pupil shape distributed white pixel.

The '''prevalence of circumcision''' is the percentage of males in a given population who have been [[circumcision|circumcised]].

==Overview==

Male circumcision is nearly universal in the [[Muslim world]] and in [[Israel]] due to the religious beliefs of the majority of [[Muslims]] and [[Jews]]; however, some non-Muslim groups living within Muslim-majority countries, such as [[Armenians]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], do not practise it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi = 10.1007/978-94-007-6407-1_20|chapter = Reclaiming Circumcision: Armenian Stories|title = Genital Cutting: Protecting Children from Medical, Cultural, and Religious Infringements|pages = 307–315|year = 2013|last1 = Vardanyan|first1 = Astrik N|isbn = 978-94-007-6406-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is prevalent in some Muslim-majority countries in [[southeast Asia]] such as [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]]; however, the WHO states that there is "little non-religious circumcision in [[Asia]], with the exceptions of the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]] and the [[Philippines]]".&lt;ref name="WHO-GTPDSA"/&gt; In parts of [[Africa]] it is often practised as part of tribal or religious customs. The prevalence of circumcision is also high in the [[United States]], although there has been a slight (~6%) decrease in routine neonatal circumcision in recent years.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In contrast, rates are much lower in most of [[Europe]], parts of [[southern Africa]], most of Asia, [[Oceania]] and [[Latin America]], constituting [[South America]], [[Central America]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Drain"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drain PK, Halperin DT, Hughes JP, Klausner JD, Bailey RC | title = Male circumcision, religion, and infectious diseases: an ecologic analysis of 118 developing countries | journal = BMC Infectious Diseases | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 172 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17137513 | pmc = 1764746 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2334-6-172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom are examples of countries that have seen a decline in male circumcision in recent decades, while there have been indications of increasing demand in southern Africa, partly for preventive reasons due to the [[HIV]] [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|epidemic there]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wise J | title = Demand for male circumcision rises in a bid to prevent HIV | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 84 | issue = 7 | pages = 509–11 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16878217 | pmc = 2627386 | url = http://www.scielosp.org/pdf/bwho/v84n7/v84n7a05.pdf | quote = As a result, there are already indications of increasing demand for male circumcision in traditionally non-circumcising societies in Southern Africa. | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==
Studies indicate that about 62% of African males are circumcised. However, the rate varies widely between different regions, and among ethnic and religious groups, with Muslim North Africans practising it for religious reasons, central Africans as part of tribal rituals or local custom, (with some practising [[female genital mutilation]] as well) and some traditionally non-circumcising populations in the South recently adopting the practice due to measures by the World Health Organisation to prevent AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Questions and answers: NIAID-sponsored adult male circumcision trials in Kenya and Uganda |publisher=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases |date=December 2006 |url=http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/QA/AMC12_QA.htm |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309060025/https://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/QA/AMC12_QA.htm |archive-date=9 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Williams, B.G. ''et al.'' commented that: "Most of the currently available data on the prevalence of [male circumcision] are several decades old, while several of the recent studies were carried out as adjuncts to demographic and health surveys and were not designed to determine the prevalence of [male circumcision]."&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams BG, Lloyd-Smith JO, Gouws E, Hankins C, Getz WM, Hargrove J, de Zoysa I, Dye C, Auvert B | title = The potential impact of male circumcision on HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = e262 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16822094 | pmc = 1489185 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumcision in Canada followed the pattern that existed in other English speaking countries, picking up the practice during the 1900s to prevent masturbation and other perceived issues of the time, and then had its rate of circumcision decline due to new policy statements passed and due to coverage for the procedure being dropped, with a pattern of declining incidence of circumcision occurring from 1970 to 1979 after a new policy statement was released In 1975.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Paediatric Society]] offered an estimate of 48 percent for the prevalence of male circumcision in Canada in 1970 prior to this fall in prevalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Neonatal circumcision revisited.

====United States====
The [[Centers For Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) uses two data sources to track circumcision rates. The first is the [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]] (NHANES), which records circumcisions performed at any time at any location. The second is the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS), which does not record circumcisions performed outside the hospital setting or those performed at any age following discharge from the birth hospitalization.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morris BJ, Bailis SA, Wiswell TE | title = Circumcision rates in the United States: rising or falling? What effect might the new affirmative pediatric policy statement have? | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 89 | issue = 5 | pages = 677–86 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24702735 | doi = 10.1016/j.mayocp.2014.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based off NHANES data, the CDC estimated that 80.5% of American males aged 14 to 59 years old from 2005 to 2010 were circumcised. Among racial breakdown, 90.8% of [[Non-Hispanic whites|non-Hispanic white males]], 75.7% of non-Hispanic [[African Americans|black]], and 44% of [[Mexican American]] males from that same age group and time span were circumcised.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Based off NHDS data, the CDC reported a national decline in circumcision rates of newborns, from 64.5% to 58.3%, during the 32-year period from 1972 to 2010. Trends varied regionally, with the Midwest mirroring the national trend; in the Northeast there was no discernible trend in the 32-year period; the South experienced an increase in circumcision rates from 1979 until 1998 and then a decline until 2010; finally, the West saw a decrease of 37% during the period in question, with the biggest drop happening in the 1980's, continuing with a slower decrease until 2010.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Trends in Circumcision for Male Newborns in U.S. Hospitals: 1979-2010|author=The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Health Care Statistics |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/circumcision_2013/circumcision_2013.pdf|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline is in large part due to the growing Hispanic population.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is increasingly common due do increasing health care costs that health care providers require the mother and baby to leave the hospital within 24 hours after birth without complications. As a result, a large number of circumcisions are performed in out-patient clinics and are not recorded in the NHDS data.

In 2009, the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) reported its findings regarding newborn circumcisions based on U.S. region and income bracket. Its data came from several states' hospital associations and health departments. The Western Region reported a rate of 24.6%, the North Central Region reported a rate of 76.2%, the Northeast Region reported a rate of 67%, and the Southern Region reported a rate of 55.7%. The combined newborn circumcision rate of all regions was 54.5%, which is similar but slightly lower than the NHDS data from 2010. There was also significant variation between rural and urban areas. Rural areas reported a rate of 66.9%, while urban areas reported a rate of 41.2%. The lowest income bracket reported a rate of 51.5%, while the highest income bracket reported a rate of 60.4%.&lt;ref name="hcup" /&gt;

[[Medicaid]] funding for infant circumcision used to be available in every state, but starting with California in 1982, 18 states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, and Washington) had eliminated Medicaid coverage of routine (non-therapeutic) circumcision by July 2011.&lt;ref name = "adler"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, published in early 2009, found a difference in the neonatal male circumcision rate of 24% between states with and without Medicaid coverage. The study was controlled for other factors such as the percentage of Hispanic patients.&lt;ref name="Leibovitz"&gt;

When we controlled for other factors, hospitals in states in which Medicaid covers routine male circumcision had circumcision rates that were 24 percentage points higher than did hospitals in states without such coverage (P &lt; .001). }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have shown that the rise of immigrants from [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asian]], [[South Asia]] and Hispanic [[South America|South American]] countries are a large factor in why the rates continue to drop in the US.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/circumcision-rates-continue-to-drop-in-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumcision was the second-most common procedure performed on patients under one year of age.&lt;ref&gt;Pfuntner A., Wier L.M., Stocks C. Most Frequent Procedures Performed in U.S. Hospitals, 2011. HCUP Statistical Brief #165. October 2013. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD. [http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb165.jsp].&lt;/ref&gt; There are various explanations for why the infant circumcision rate in the United States is different from comparable countries. Many parents’ decisions about circumcision are preconceived, which may contribute to the high rate of elective circumcision.&lt;ref name="CSA:I-99"&gt;{{cite web|date=December 1999 |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/13585.html |title=Report 10 of the Council on Scientific Affairs (I-99):Neonatal Circumcision |website=1999 AMA Interim Meeting: Summaries and Recommendations of Council on Scientific Affairs Reports |pages=17 |publisher=[[American Medical Association]] |access-date=2006-06-13 |deadurl=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705182814/http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/13585.html |archive-date=5 July 2007 }}

====South Korea====
Circumcision is largely a modern-day phenomenon in South Korea. While the rate in the twentieth century has been nearing 80%, virtually no circumcision was performed just a century ago, as it was against Korea's long and strong tradition of preserving the body as a gift from parents.&lt;ref name="Kimetal"/&gt; A 2001 study of 20-year-old South Korean men found that 78% were circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ku JH, Kim ME, Lee NK, Park YH | title = Circumcision practice patterns in South Korea: community based survey | journal = Sexually Transmitted Infections | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–7 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12576619 | pmc = 1744613 | doi = 10.1136/sti.79.1.65 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the authors commented that "South Korea has possibly the largest absolute number of teenage or adult circumcisions anywhere in the world. Because circumcision started through contact with the American military during the Korean War, South Korea has an unusual history of circumcision." According to a 2002 study, 86.3% of South Korean males aged 14–29 were circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pang MG, Kim DS | title = Extraordinarily high rates of male circumcision in South Korea: history and underlying causes | journal = BJU International | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 48–54 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11849160 | doi = 10.1046/j.1464-410x.2002.02545.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it's the case of 75.8% of the same age group. Only after 1999 has some information against circumcision become available (at the time of the 2012 study, only 3% of Korean internet sites, using the most popular Korean search engine [[Naver]], are against indiscriminate circumcision and 97% are for).&lt;ref name="Kimetal"/&gt; The authors of the study speculate "that the very existence of information about the history of Korean circumcision, its contrary nature relative to a longstanding tradition, its introduction by the US military, etc., has been extremely influential on the decision-making process regarding circumcision."&lt;ref name="Kimetal"/&gt;

A national survey on sexual attitudes in 2000 found that 15.8% of men or boys in the United Kingdom (ages 16–44) were circumcised by their parents' choosing. 11.7% of 16- to 19-year-olds, and 19.6% of 40- to 44-year-olds said they had been circumcised.

They called for a target to reduce the percentage to 2%.

In Finland, the overall prevalence of circumcision is 2-4%, according to a recent publication by the Finnish Health Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.terveyskirjasto.fi/xmedia/duo/duo98530.pdf|title = Esinahan kirurgia|date = |access-date = 20 October 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Maija|first = Kolehmainen|first2 = Seppo|last2 = Taskinen | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents found that 10.9% of boys aged 0–17 had been circumcised.&lt;ref name="kamtsiuris"/&gt;

In [[Slovenia]], a 1999-2001 national probability sample of the general population aged 18–49 years found that overall, 4.5% of Slovenian male citizens reported being circumcised. Prevalence strongly varied across religious groups, with 92.4% of Muslims being circumcised, 1.7% of Roman Catholics, 0% of other religious affiliations (Evangelic, Serbian Orthodox, other), and 7.1% of those with no religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klavs I, Hamers FF | title = Male circumcision in Slovenia: results from a national probability sample survey | journal = Sexually Transmitted Infections | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–50 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 17881413 | doi = 10.1136/sti.2007.027524 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5962502 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Circumcision reached its peak in Australia in the 1950s with a rate of more than 80%, but has steadily fallen to an estimated 26% in 2012. The rate of circumcision has dropped rapidly over the years. It is estimated that males aged roughly 80 percent of males 35 and under are intact, and remaining 20 percent are circumcised. Circumcision rates have declined drastically in recent years as young fathers are starting to have children of their own and leaving them intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.circinfo.org/statistics.html |title=Incidence and prevalence of circumcision in Australia |website=Circumcision Information Australia |date=January 2013 |access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumcision status was more common with males over 30 than males under 30, and more common with males who were born in Australia. 66% of males born in Australia were circumcised and less than 1/3 of males under 30 were circumcised.&lt;ref name=Australia1&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferris JA, Richters J, Pitts MK, Shelley JM, Simpson JM, Ryall R, Smith AM | title = Circumcision in Australia: further evidence on its effects on sexual health and wellbeing | journal = Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 160–4 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 23331360 | doi = 10.1111/j.1753-6405.2010.00501.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a decline in the rate of infant circumcision in Australia.&lt;ref name="WHO-GTPDSA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Richters2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richters J, Smith AM, de Visser RO, Grulich AE, Rissel CE | title = Circumcision in Australia: prevalence and effects on sexual health | journal = International Journal of STD &amp; AIDS | volume = 17 | issue = 8 | pages = 547–54 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16925903 | doi = 10.1258/095646206778145730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]] (RACP) estimated in 2010 that 10 to 20 percent of newborn boys are being circumcised,&lt;ref name = "RACP2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.racp.edu.au//index.cfm?objectid=65118B16-F145-8B74-236C86100E4E3E8E |title=Circumcision of Male Infants |publisher=Royal Australasian College of Physicians |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the prevalence of male circumcision is much higher due to the presence of older circumcised males remaining in the population.&lt;ref&gt;The incidence of circumcision in Australia was very high until 1971 when it started a steep decline. Consequently, circumcised males tend to be older.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Medicare Australia]] records show the number of males younger than six months that underwent circumcision dropped from 19,663 in 2007/08 to 6309 (4%) in 2016/17.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/why-is-the-number-of-male-circumcisions-declining-in-australia |title=Why is the number of male circumcisions declining in Australia? |author=Rashida Yosufzai |work=SBS News |date=19 February 2018 |access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''prototype 180''''' is an artwork by [[United States|American]] [[conceptual art]]ist [[Mary Ellen Carroll]] who lives and works in [[New York City]] and [[Houston]]. ''prototype 180'' is "the centerpiece of Carroll's Innovation Territories, an initiative co-sponsored by the Rice University Building Institute.&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=13796"&lt;/ref&gt; ''prototype 180'' is located at 6513 Sharpsview Drive, Houston.&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.domusweb.it/en/news/prototype-180-by-mary-ellen-carroll/"&lt;/ref&gt;Houston was self-selected itself as the site of the artwork because it lacks an official land-use policy. 

The artwork "will make architecture performative."&lt;ref name="artforum1"&gt;"http://artforum.com/words/id=23335"&lt;/ref&gt; It is literally a ground-shifting exercise, because it structurally involves the rotation, back to front, of a single-family, ranch-style house and its surrounding land in the development of [[Sharpstown]], a suburb of [[Houston]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Texas, an Artist Plans to Rotate a House 180 Degrees |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/garden/07qna.html?_r=1 |work=The New York Times |date=October 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the rotation, the structure will be retrofitted and rehabilitated to become an occupied structure that will be become an institute for the study of considered urbanism.&lt;ref&gt;"http://artforum.com/words/id=23335"&lt;/ref&gt; In planning for 10 years, ''prototype 180'' is described as "reconsideration of monumentality that combines live performance, sculpture, architecture and technology."&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=14815&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a modern version of an ancient view that the basic stuff of the universe manifests itself both physically and as conscious experience (a dual-aspect theory in the traditions of [[Spinoza]] and [[Fechner]]).&lt;ref&gt;Velmans, Max. "Dualism, Reductionism and Reflexive Monism," in Max Velmans and Susan Schneider (eds.). ''The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, pp. 346-358.

[[Monism]] is the view that the universe, at the deepest level of analysis, is composed of one fundamental kind of stuff. This is usually contrasted with [[substance dualism]], the view found in the writings of [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]] that the universe is composed of two kinds of stuff, the physical and the stuff of [[soul]], [[mind]] or consciousness.

Reflexive monism maintains that, in its evolution from some primal undifferentiated state, the universe differentiates into distinguishable physical entities, at least some of which have the potential for conscious experience, such as [[human being]]s.  While remaining embedded within and dependent on the surrounding universe and composed of the same fundamental stuff, each human, equipped with perceptual and [[cognition|cognitive]] systems, has an individual perspective on, or view of, the rest of the universe and him or her self.  In this sense, each human participates in a process whereby the universe differentiates into parts and becomes conscious of itself, making the process reflexive. Donald Price and James Barrell write that, according to reflexive monism, experience and matter are two complementary (first- and third-person viewable) sides of the same reality, and neither can be reduced to the other. That brain states are causes and correlates of consciousness, they write, does not mean that they are ontologically identical to it, and they develop the use of complementary first- and third-person perspectives into a non-reductive, empirical program for investigating the relationship of conscious experience to neuroscience.&lt;ref name=Price277&gt;Price, Donald D. and Barrell, James J.

'''Social cognitive theory''' ('''SCT'''), used in psychology, education, and communication, holds that portions of an individual's knowledge acquisition can be directly related to [[observing]] others within the context of social interactions, experiences, and outside media influences. This theory was advanced by Albert Bandura as an extension of his social learning theory. The theory states that when people observe a model performing a behavior and the consequences of that behavior, they remember the sequence of events and use this information to guide subsequent behaviors.  Observing a model can also prompt the viewer to engage in behavior they already learned.&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 1986"&gt;Bandura, A., Social foundations of thought and action : a social cognitive theory. 1986, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 2002 pp. 94-124"&gt;Bandura, A. (2008). Social cognitive theory of mass communication. In J. Bryant &amp; M. B. Oliver (Eds.), Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research (pp. 94-124). New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, people do not learn new behaviors solely by trying them and either succeeding or failing, but rather, the survival of humanity is dependent upon the replication of the actions of others. Depending on whether people are rewarded or punished for their behavior and the outcome of the behavior, the observer may choose to replicate behavior modeled. Media provides models for a vast array of people in many different environmental settings.

==History==
The conceptual roots for social cognitive theory come from [[Edwin B. Holt]] and [[Harold Chapman Brown]]'s 1931 book theorizing that all animal action is based on fulfilling the psychological needs of "feeling, emotion, and desire". The most notable component of this theory is that it predicted a person cannot learn to imitate until they are imitated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Holt, E.B.|author2=H.C. Brown|lastauthoramp=y|title=Animal drive and the learning process, an essay toward radical empiricism|year=1931|location=New York|publisher=H. Holt and Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Neal E. Miller and John Dollard presented their book with a revision of Holt's social learning and imitation theory.  They argued four factors contribute to learning: drives, cues, responses, and rewards.  One driver is social motivation, which includes imitativeness, the process of matching an act to an appropriate cue of where and when to perform the act.  A behavior is imitated depending on whether the model receives a positive or negative response consequences.&lt;ref name="Miller &amp; Dollard"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miller, N.E.|author2=J. Dollard|author3=R. Yale University|lastauthoramp=y|title=Institute of Human, Social learning and imitation|year=1941|location=New Haven; London|publisher=Pub. for the Institute of human relations by Yale university press; H. Milford, Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller and  Dollard argued that if one were motivated to learn a particular behavior, then that particular behavior would be learned through clear observations. By imitating these observed actions the individual observer would solidify that learned action and would be rewarded with [[positive reinforcement]].

The proposition of social learning was expanded upon and theorized by Canadian psychologist [[Albert Bandura]]. Bandura, along with his students and colleagues conducted a series of studies, known as the [[Bobo doll experiment]], in 1961 and 1963 to find out why and when children display aggressive behaviors. These studies demonstrated the value of modeling for acquiring novel behaviors. These studies helped Bandura publish his seminal article and book in 1977 that expanded on the idea of how behavior is acquired, and thus built from Miller and Dollard's research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Evans, R.I.|author2=A. Bandura|lastauthoramp=y|title=Albert Bandura, the man and his ideas—a dialogue|year=1989|location=New York|publisher=Praeger}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Bandura's 1977 article, he claimed that Social Learning Theory shows a direct correlation between a person's perceived self-efficacy and behavioral change.  Self-efficacy comes from four sources: "performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bandura | first1 = A | year = 1977 | title = Self-efficacy: Toward a Unifying Theory of Behavioral Change  | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 84 | issue = 2| pages = 191–215 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.2.191|pmid= 847061 | url=https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Bandura/Bandura1977PR.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Bandura published his second book, which expanded and renamed his original theory. He called the new theory ''social cognitive theory''.  Bandura changed the name to emphasize the major role cognition plays in encoding and performing behaviors. In this book, Bandura argued that human behavior is caused by personal, behavioral, and environmental influences.&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 1986"/&gt;

In 2001, Bandura brought SCT to mass communication in his journal article that stated the theory could be used to analyze how "symbolic communication influences human thought, affect and action".  The theory shows how new behavior diffuses through society by psychosocial factors governing acquisition and adoption of the behavior.&lt;ref name="Bandura"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bandura, A.|title=Social Cognitive Theory of Mass Communication|journal=Media Psychology|year=2001|volume=3|issue=3|p=265–299|url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/crp/Media/Bandura_01.pdf|doi=10.1207/S1532785XMEP0303_03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Bandura published a book chapter -- ''The Social and Policy Impact of Social Cognitive Theory''—to extend SCT'S application in health promotion and urgent [[global issue]]s, which provides insight into addressing global problems through a macro social lens, aiming at improving equality of individuals' lives under the umbrellas of SCT.&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 2011 pp. 33-70"&gt;Bandura, A. (2011).  The Social and Policy Impact of Social Cognitive Theory.  In M. Mark, S. Donaldson, &amp; B. Campbell (Eds.), Social Psychology and Evaluation. (pp. 33-70). New York, NY:Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

SCT has been applied to many areas of human functioning such as career choice and organizational behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lent|first=Robert|author2=Steven D. Brown |author3=Gail Hackett |title=Toward a Unifying Social Cognitive Theory of Career and Academic Interest, Choice, and Performance|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|date=August 1994|volume=45|issue=1|pages=79–122|doi=10.1006/jvbe.1994.1027}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as in understanding classroom motivation, learning, and achievement.

==Current status==
Social Cognitive Theory originated in psychology, but based on an unofficial November 2013 Google Scholar search, only 2 percent of articles published on SCT are in the pure psychology field.  About 20 percent of articles are from Education and 16 percent from Business.  The majority of publications using SCT, 56 percent, come from the field of Applied Health Psychology. The majority of current research in Health Psychology focuses on testing SCT in behavioral change campaigns as opposed to expanding on the theory. Campaign topics include: increasing fruit and vegetable intake, increasing physical activity&lt;ref&gt;Freigoun, Mohammad T., César A. Martín, Alicia B. Magann, Daniel E. Rivera, Sayali S. Phatak, Elizabeth V. Korinek, and Eric B. Hekler. "System identification of Just Walk: A behavioral mHealth intervention for promoting physical activity." In American Control Conference (ACC), 2017, pp. 116-121. IEEE, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;, HIV education, and breastfeeding.

Born in 1925, Bandura is still influencing the world with expansions of SCT. His recent work, published May 2011, focuses on how SCT impacts areas of both health and population in relation to climate change.&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 2011 pp. 33-70"/&gt; He proposes that these problems could be solved through television serial dramas that show models similar to viewers performing the desired behavior. On health, Bandura writes that currently there is little incentive for doctors to write prescriptions for healthy behavior, but he believes the cost of fixing health problems start to outweigh the benefits of being healthy.  Bandura argues that we are on the cusp of moving from a disease model (focusing on people with problems) to a health model (focusing on people being healthy) and SCT is the theory that should be used to further a healthy society.  Specifically on Population, Bandura states that population growth is a global crisis because of its correlation with depletion and degradation of our planet's resources.  Bandura argues that SCT should be used to increase birth control use, reduce gender inequality through education, and to model environmental conservation to improve the state of the planet.

==Overview==
Social cognitive theory is a learning theory based on the idea that people learn by observing others. These learned behaviors can be central to one's personality. While social psychologists agree that the environment one grows up in contributes to behavior, the individual person (and therefore cognition) is just as important.  People learn by observing others, with the environment, behavior, and cognition acting as primary factors that influence development in a reciprocal triadic relationship. Each behavior witnessed can change a person's way of thinking (cognition). Similarly, the environment one is raised in may influence later behaviors. For example, a caregiver's mindset (also cognition) determines the environment in which their children are raised.

The core concepts of this theory are explained by [[Albert Bandura|Bandura]] through a schematization of triadic reciprocal causation,&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 2002 pp. 94-124"/&gt; The schema shows how the reproduction of an observed behavior is influenced by the interaction of the following three determinants: 
# Personal: Whether the individual has high or low self-efficacy toward the behavior (i.e. Get the learner to believe in his or her personal abilities to correctly complete a behavior). 
# Behavioral: The response an individual receives after they perform a behavior (i.e. Provide chances for the learner to experience successful learning as a result of performing the behavior correctly). 
# Environmental: Aspects of the environment or setting that influence the individual's ability to successfully complete a behavior (i.e. Make environmental conditions conducive for improved self-efficacy by providing appropriate support and materials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-efficacy theory|work=Edutech Wiki|url=http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Self-efficacy_theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that learning can occur without a change in behavior. According to J.E. Ormrod's general principles of social learning, while a visible change in behavior is the most common proof of learning, it is not absolutely necessary. Social learning theorists believe that because people can learn through observation alone, their learning may not necessarily be shown in their performance. These are interdependent on each other and its influence can be directly linked with individual or group psychological behavior. &lt;ref&gt;Stajkovic, A., and Luthans, F. (2003). “Social Cognitive Theory and Self-Efficacy: Implication for Motivation Theory and Practice.” Motivation and Work Behavior, by Lyman W. Porter et al., McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2003, pp. 126–139. &lt;/ref&gt;According to Alex Stajkovic and Fred Luthans it is critically important to recognize that the relative influences exerted by one, two, or three interacting factors on motivated behavior will vary depending on different activities, different individuals and different circumstances.

Social cognitive theory is proposed in an agentic perspective, which suggests that, instead of being just shaped by environments or inner forces, individuals are self-developing, self-regulating, self-reflecting and proactive.&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 1986" /&gt; Specifically, human agency operates within three modes:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pajares|first1=Frank|last2=Prestin|first2=Abby|last3=Chen|first3=Jason|last4=Nabi|first4=Robin L|title=Social cognitive theory and media effects|journal=The Sage handbook of media processes and effects|date=2009|pages=283–297}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
* Individual Agency: A person’s own influence on the environment;  
* Proxy Agency: Another person’s effort on securing the individual’s interests; 
* Collective Agency: A group of people work together to achieve the common benefits.

Human agency has four core properties:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

* Intentionality: Individuals’ active decision on engaging in certain activities; 
* Forethought: Individuals’ ability to anticipate the outcome of certain actions; 
* Self-reactiveness: Individuals’ ability to construct and regulate appropriate behaviors;
* Self-reflectiveness: Individuals’ ability to reflect and evaluate the soundness of their cognitions and behaviors.

=== Human capability ===

Evolving over time, human beings are featured with advanced neural systems, which enable individuals to acquire knowledge and skills by both direct and symbolic terms.&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 2002 pp. 94-124" /&gt; Four primary capabilities are addressed as important foundations of social cognitive theory: symbolizing capability, self-regulation capability, self-reflective capability, and vicarious capability.&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 2002 pp. 94-124" /&gt;

# Symbolizing Capability: People are affected not only by direct experience but also indirect events. Instead of merely learning through laborious trial-and-error process, human beings are able to symbolically perceive events conveyed in messages, construct possible solutions, and evaluate the anticipated outcomes.  
# Self-regulation Capability: Individuals can regulate their own intentions and behaviors by themselves. Self-regulation lies on both negative and positive feedback systems, in which discrepancy reduction and discrepancy production are involved. That is, individuals proactively motivate and guide their actions by setting challenging goals and then making effort to fulfill them. In doing so, individuals gain skills, resources, self-efficacy and beyond.
# Self-reflective Capability: Human beings can evaluate their thoughts and actions by themselves, which is identified as another distinct feature of human beings. By verifying the adequacy and soundness of their thoughts through enactive, various, social, or logical manner, individuals can generate new ideas, adjust their thoughts, and take actions accordingly.  
# Vicarious Capability: One critical ability human being featured is to adopt skills and knowledge from information communicated through a wide array of mediums. By vicariously observing others’ actions and its consequences, individuals can gain insights into their own activities. Vicarious capability is of great value to human beings’ cognitive development in nowadays, in which most of our information encountered in our lives derives from the mass media than trial-and-error process.

==Theoretical components==

=== Modeling ===

Social cognitive theory revolves around the process of knowledge acquisition or learning directly correlated to the observation of models. The models can be those of an interpersonal imitation or media sources. Effective modeling teaches general rules and strategies for dealing with different situations.&lt;ref name="Bandura1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bandura, A.|year=1988|url=http://www.agsm.edu.au/eajm/8812/pdf/bandurav13n2.pdf|title=Organizational Application of Social Cognitive Theory|journal=Australian Journal of Management|volume=13|issue=2|pages=275–302|doi=10.1177/031289628801300210|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304022549/http://www.agsm.edu.au/eajm/8812/pdf/bandurav13n2.pdf|archivedate=2011-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate that people learn from watching others, Albert Bandura and his colleagues constructed a series of experiments using a Bobo doll. In the first experiment, children were exposed to either an aggressive or non-aggressive model of either the same sex or opposite sex as the child. There was also a control group. The aggressive models played with the Bobo doll in an aggressive manner, while the non-aggressive models played with other toys.  They found that children who were exposed to the aggressive models performed more aggressive actions toward the Bobo doll afterward, and that boys were more likely to do so than girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bandura|first=Albert|author2=Ross, D. |author3=Ross, S. |title=Transmission of aggression through imitation of aggressive models|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1961|volume=63|pages=575–582|doi=10.1037/h0045925|pmid=13864605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following that study, Albert Bandura tested whether the same was true for models presented through media by constructing an experiment he called ''Bobo Doll Behavior: A Study of Aggression''. In this experiment Bandura exposed a group of children to a video featuring violent and aggressive actions. After the video he then placed the children in a room with a Bobo doll to see how they behaved with it. Through this experiment, Bandura discovered that children who had watched the violent video subjected the dolls to more aggressive and violent behavior, while children not exposed to the video did not. This experiment displays the social cognitive theory because it depicts how people reenact behaviors they see in the media. In this case, the children in this experiment reenacted the model of violence they directly learned from the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bandura|first=Albert|author2=Ross, D. |author3=Ross, S. |title=Imitation of film-mediated aggressive models|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1963|volume=66|pages=3–11|doi=10.1037/h0048687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observations should include: 
* ''Attention'' Observers selectively give attention to specific social behavior depending on accessibility, relevance, complexity, functional value of the behavior or some observer's personal attributes such as cognitive capability, value preference, preconceptions. 
* ''Retention'' Observe a behavior and subsequent consequences, then convert that observation to a symbol that can be accessed for future reenactments of the behavior.  Note: When a ''positive behavior'' is shown a positive reinforcement should follow, this parallel is similar for ''negative behavior''. 
* ''Production'' refers to the symbolic representation of the original behavior being translated into action through reproduction of the observed behavior in seemingly appropriate contexts.  During reproduction of the behavior, a person receives feedback from others and can adjust their representation for future references. 
* ''Motivational process'' reenacts a behavior depending on responses and consequences the observer receives when reenacting that behavior.&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 2002 pp. 94-124"/&gt;

Modeling does not limit to only live demonstrations but also verbal and written behaviour can act as indirect forms of modeling. Modeling not only allows students to learn behaviour that they should repeat but also to inhibit certain behaviours. For instance, if a teacher glares at one student who is talking out of turn, other students may suppress this behavior to avoid a similar reaction.  Teachers model both material objectives and underlying curriculum of virtuous living. Teachers should also be dedicated to the building of high [[self-efficacy]] levels in their students by recognizing their accomplishments.

=== Outcome expectancies ===

To learn a particular behavior, people must understand what the potential outcome is if they repeat that behavior. The observer does not expect the actual rewards or punishments incurred by the model, but anticipates similar outcomes when imitating the behavior (called ''[[outcome expectancies]]''), which is why modeling impacts cognition and behavior. These expectancies are heavily influenced by the environment that the observer grows up in; for example, the expected consequences for a [[DUI]] in the United States of America are a fine, with possible jail time, whereas the same charge in another country might lead to the infliction of the death penalty.

For example, in the case of a student, the instructions the teacher provides help students see what outcome a particular behaviour leads to. It is the duty of the teacher to teach a student that when a behaviour is successfully learned, the outcomes are meaningful and valuable to the students.

=== Self-efficacy ===

Social cognitive theory posits that learning most likely occurs if there is a close identification between the observer and the model and if the observer also has a good deal of [[self-efficacy]]. Self–efficacy is the extent to which an individual believes that they can master a particular skill. Self-efficacy beliefs function as an important set of proximal determinants of human motivation, affect, and action—which operate on action through motivational, cognitive, and affective intervening processes.&lt;ref name="Bandura2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bandura, A.|year=1989|title=Human Agency in Social Cognitive Theory|journal=American Psychologist|volume=44|issue=9|pages=1175–1184|pmid=2782727|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.44.9.1175|url=https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Bandura/Bandura1989AP.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bandura, self-efficacy is "the belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bandura, A.|title=Self-efficacy in changing societies|location=Cambridge; New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bandura and other researchers  have found an individual's self-efficacy plays a major role in how goals, tasks, and challenges are approached. Individuals with high self-efficacy are more likely to believe they can master challenging problems and they can recover quickly from setbacks and disappointments. Individuals with low self-efficacy tend to be less confident and don't believe they can perform well, which leads them to avoid challenging tasks.  Therefore, self-efficacy plays a central role in behavior performance. Observers who have high level of self-efficacy are more likely to adopt observational learning behaviors.

Self-efficacy can be developed or increased by: 
* '''Mastery experience''', which is a process that helps an individual achieve simple tasks that lead to more complex objectives. 
* '''Social modeling''' provides an identifiable model that shows the processes that accomplish a behavior. 
* '''Improving physical and emotional states''' refers to ensuring a person is rested and relaxed prior to attempting a new behavior. The less relaxed, the less patient, the more likely they won't attain the goal behavior. 
* '''Verbal persuasion''' is providing encouragement for a person to complete a task or achieve a certain behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=McAlister AL, Perry CL, Parcel GS|chapter=How Individuals, Environments, and Health Behaviors Interact: Social Cognitive Theory|title=Health Behavior and Health Education: Theory, Research, and Practice|edition=4th|location=San Francisco, CA|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc|year=2008|pp=169–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, students become more effortful, active, pay attention, highly motivated and better learners when they perceive that they have mastered a particular task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bandura|first=Albert|title=Perceived Self Efficacy in Cognitive Development and Functioning|journal=Educational Psychologist|year=1993|volume=28|issue=2|pages=117–148|doi=10.1207/s15326985ep2802_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the duty of the teacher to allow student to perceive in their efficacy by providing feedback to understand their level of proficiency. Teachers should ensure that the students have the knowledge and strategies they need to complete the tasks.

[[Self-efficacy]] has also been used to predict behavior in various health related situations such as weight loss, quitting smoking, and recovery from heart attack. In relation to exercise science, [[self-efficacy]] has produced some of the most consistent results revealing an increase in participation in exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Weinberg, Robert S.|author2=Gould, Daniel|title=Foundation of Sport and Exercise Psychology|edition=4th|location=Champaign, IL|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2007|page=422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identification ===

Identification allows the observer to feel a one-to-one similarity with the model, and can thus lead to a higher chance of the observer following through with the modeled action.&lt;ref name="Bandura1"/&gt; People are more likely to follow behaviors modeled by someone with whom they can identify with. The more commonalities or emotional attachments perceived between the observer and the model, the more likely the observer learns and reenact the modeled behavior.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Applications==

=== Mass communication  ===

==== Media contents studies ====
Social cognitive theory is often applied as a theoretical framework of studies pertained to media representation regarding race, gender, age and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mastro|first1=Dana E|last2=Stern|first2=Susannah R|title=Representations of race in television commercials: A content analysis of prime-time advertising|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|date=2003|volume=47|issue=4|pages=638–647|doi=10.1207/s15506878jobem4704_9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raman|first1=Priya|last2=Harwood|first2=Jake|last3=Weis|first3=Deborah|last4=Anderson|first4=Judith L|last5=Miller|first5=Grace|title=Portrayals of older adults in US and Indian magazine advertisements: A cross-cultural comparison|journal=The Howard Journal of Communications|date=2008|volume=19|issue=3|pages=221–240|doi=10.1080/10646170802218214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aubrey|first1=Jennifer Stevens|title=Sex and punishment: An examination of sexual consequences and the sexual double standard in teen programming|journal=Sex Roles|date=2004|volume=50|issue=7-8|pages=505–514|doi=10.1023/b:sers.0000023070.87195.07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social cognitive theory suggested heavily repeated images presented in mass media can be potentially processed and encoded by the viewers (Bandura, 2011). Media content analytic studies examine the substratum of media messages that viewers are exposed to, which could provide an opportunity to uncover the social values attached to these media representations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Although media contents studies cannot directly test the cognitive process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nabi|first1=Robin L|last2=Clark|first2=Shannon|title=Exploring the limits of social cognitive theory: Why negatively reinforced behaviors on TV may be modeled anyway|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2008|volume=58|issue=3|pages=407–427|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.00392.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; findings can offer an avenue to predict potential media effects from modeling certain contents, which provides evidence and guidelines for designing subsequent empirical work.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==== Media effects studies ====
Social cognitive theory is pervasively employed in studies examining attitude or behavior changes triggered by the mass media. As Bandura suggested, people can learn how to perform behaviors through media modeling.&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 2002 pp. 94-124" /&gt; SCT has been widely applied in media studies pertained to sports, health, education and beyond. For instance, Hardin and Greer in 2009 examined the gender-typing of sports within the theoretical framework of social cognitive theory, suggesting that sports media consumption and gender-role socialization significantly related with gender perception of sports in American college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hardin|first1=Marie|last2=Greer|first2=Jennifer D|title=The influence of gender-role socialization, media use and sports participation on perceptions of gender-appropriate sports|journal=Journal of Sport Behavior|date=2009|volume=32|issue=2|pages=207–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In health communication, social cognitive theory has been applied in research related to smoking quit, HIV prevention, safe sex behaviors, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|title=Social cognitive theory and exercise of control over HIV infection|journal=Preventing AIDS|date=1994|pages=25–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|title=Health promotion by social cognitive means|journal=Health education &amp; behavior|date=2004|volume=31|issue=2|pages=143–164|doi=10.1177/1090198104263660}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Martino, Collins, Kanouse, Elliott, and Berry in 2005 examined the relationship between the exposure to television’s sexual content and adolescents’ sexual behavior through the lens of social cognitive theory, confirming the significant relationship between the two variables among white and African American groups; however, no significant correlation was found between the two variables in the ethic group of Hispanics, indicating that peer norm could possibly serve as a mediator of the two examined variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martino|first1=Steven C|last2=Collins|first2=Rebecca L|last3=Kanouse|first3=David E|last4=Elliott|first4=Marc|last5=Berry|first5=Sandra H|title=Social cognitive processes mediating the relationship between exposure to television's sexual content and adolescents' sexual behavior|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2005|volume=89|issue=6|page=914|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.89.6.914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public health ===

Miller's 2005 study found that choosing the proper gender, age, and ethnicity for models ensured the success of an [[AIDS]] campaign to inner city teenagers.  This occurred because participants could identify with a recognizable peer, have a greater sense of self-efficacy, and then imitate the actions to learn the proper preventions and actions.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, Katherine (2005). Communication Theories: Perspectives, Processes, and Contexts (2nd ed.). New York, New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;
A study by Azza Ahmed in 2009 looked to see if there would be an increase in breastfeeding by mothers of preterm infants when exposed to a breastfeeding educational program guided by SCT. Sixty mothers were randomly assigned to either participate in the program or they were given routine care.  The program consisted of SCT strategies that touched on all three SCT determinants: personal – showing models performing breastfeeding correctly to improve self-efficacy, behavioral –weekly check-ins for three months reinforced participants' skills, environmental – mothers were given an observational checklist to make sure they successfully completed the behavior. The author found that mothers exposed to the program showed significant improvement in their breastfeeding skills, were more likely to exclusively breastfeed, and had fewer problems then the mothers who were not exposed to the educational program.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, A.

==Morality==
{{Main|Social cognitive theory of morality}}
Social cognitive theory emphasizes a large difference between an individual's ability to be morally competent and morally performing. [[Moral competence]] involves having the ability to perform a moral behavior, whereas [[moral performance]] indicates actually following one's idea of moral behavior in a specific situation.&lt;ref name="Santrock"&gt;Santrock, J.W. (2008). A Topical Approach to Lifespan Development (M. Ryan, Ed., 4th ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (Original work published 2002), pp. 26, 30, 478&lt;/ref&gt; Moral competencies include:
* what an individual is capable of
* what an individual knows
* what an individual's skills are
* an individual's awareness of moral rules and regulations
* an individual's cognitive ability to construct behaviors

As far as an individual's development is concerned, moral competence is the growth of cognitive-sensory processes; simply put, being aware of what is considered right and wrong. By comparison, moral performance is influenced by the possible rewards and incentives to act a certain way.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt; For example, a person's moral competence might tell them that stealing is wrong and frowned upon by society; however, if the reward for stealing is a substantial sum, their moral performance might indicate a different line of thought. Therein lies the core of social cognitive theory.

For the most part, social cognitive theory remains the same for various cultures. Since the concepts of moral behavior did not vary much between cultures (as crimes like murder, theft, and unwarranted violence are illegal in virtually every society), there is not much room for people to have different views on what is morally right or wrong. The main reason that social cognitive theory applies to all nations is because it does not say what is moral and immoral; it simply states that we can acknowledge these two concepts. Our actions in real-life scenarios are based on whether we believe the action is moral and whether the reward for violating our morals is significant enough, and nothing else.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt;

== Limitations ==
=== Modelling and mass media ===
In series TV programming, according to social cognitive theory, the awarded behaviors of liked characters are supposed to be followed by viewers, while punished behaviors are supposed to be avoided by media consumers. However, in most cases, protagonists in TV shows are less likely to experience the long-term suffering and negative consequences caused by their risky behaviors, which could potentially undermine the punishments conveyed by the media, leading to a modeling of the risky behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nabi|first1=Robin L|last2=Clark|first2=Shannon|title=Exploring the limits of social cognitive theory: Why negatively reinforced behaviors on TV may be modeled anyway|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2008|volume=58|issue=3|pages=407–427|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.00392.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nabi and Clark conducted experiments about individual’s attitudes and intentions consuming various portrayals of one-night stand sex– unsafe and [[risky sexual behavior]], finding that individuals who had not previously experience one night stand sex, consuming media portrayals of this behavior could significantly increase their expectations of having an one night stand sex in the future, although negative outcomes were represented in TV shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nabi|first1=Robin L|last2=Clark|first2=Shannon|title=Exploring the limits of social cognitive theory: Why negatively reinforced behaviors on TV may be modeled anyway|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2008|volume=58|issue=3|pages=407–427|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.00392.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sociocultural perspective''' is a theory used in fields such as [[psychology]] and is used to describe [[awareness]] of circumstances surrounding individuals and how their [[Behavior|behaviors]] are affected specifically by their surrounding, social and cultural factors. According to Catherine A. Sanderson (2010) “Sociocultural perspective: A perspective describing people’s behavior and mental processes as shaped in part by their social and/or cultural contact, including race, gender, and nationality.” Sociocultural perspective theory is a broad yet significant aspect in our being. It applies to every sector of our daily lives. How we communicate, understand, relate and cope with one another is partially based on this theory. Our spiritual, mental, physical, emotional, physiological being are all influenced by factors studied by sociocultural perspective theory.

==Ideology==
Various studies examine topics using the sociocultural perspective in order to account for variability from person to person and acknowledge that social and cultural differences affect these individuals. One example comes from the journal ''[[European Psychologist]]'': Investigating Motivation in Context: Developing Sociocultural Perspectives by Richard A. Walker, Kimberley Pressick-kilborn, Bert M. Lancaster, and Erica J. Sainsbury (2004). Recently, however, a renewed interest in the contextual nature of motivation has come about for several reasons. First, the relatively recent influence of the ideas of Vygotsky and his followers (John-Steiner &amp; Mahn, 1996; Greeno &amp; The Middle School Through Applications Project, 1998) in [[educational psychology]] has led writers in the field (Goodenow, 1992; Pintrich, 1994; Anderman &amp; Anderman, 2000) to acknowledge the importance of context and to call for its greater recognition in educational psychology, and more particularly in motivational research. As both Goodenow (1992) and Hickey (1997) note, in sociocultural theories deriving from Vygotsky, human activities, events, and actions cannot be separated from the context in which they occur so that context becomes an important issue in sociocultural research. Second, researchers concerned with learning and cognition (e.g., Greeno et al., 1998) have come to see these processes also as being situated in particular contexts. While this view, with its emphasis on the distributed nature of learning and cognition, has origins in sociocultural theories".

This theory or perspective is examined in ''[[The Modern Language Journal]]'' “A Sociocultural Perspective on Language Learning Strategies: The Role of Mediation” by Richard Donato and Dawn McCormick. According to Donato and McCormick (1994) “Sociocultural theory maintains that social interaction and cultural institutions, such as schools, classrooms, etc., have important roles to play in an individual’s cognitive growth and development.” “We believe that this perspective goes beyond current cognitive and social psychological conceptions of strategic language learning, both of which assume that language tasks and contexts are generalizable. The sociocultural perspective, on the other hand, views language learning tasks and contexts as situated activities that are continually under development (22) and that are influential upon individuals’ strategic orientations to classroom learning.”&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Language Journal'', Vol 78(4), Win, 1994. Special issue: Sociocultural theory and second language learning. pp. 453-464.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health factors==
The sociocultural perspective is also used here in order to assess use of [[Mental health professional|mental health]] services for immigrants: “From a sociocultural perspective, this article reviews causes of mental health service under use among Chinese immigrants and discusses practice implications. Factors explaining service under use among Chinese immigrants are multifaceted, extending across individual, family, cultural and system domains. The first of these is cultural explanation of mental illness. Cultural beliefs, regarding the cause of mental disorders greatly affect service use. The perceived causes of mental illness include moral, religious, or cosmological, physiological, psychological, social and genetic factors”.  From Canadian Social Work, “A Sociocultural Perspective of Mental Health Services Use by Chinese Immigrants” by Lin Fang, (2010).&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Social Work: “A Sociocultural Perspective of Mental Health Services Use by Chinese Immigrants” by Lin Fang, Autumn 2010, Vol. 12 Issue 1, p152-160, 9p&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coping==
According to ''[[Asian American Journal of Psychology]]'', "Coping with perceived racial and gender discrimination experiences among 11 Asian/Asian American female faculty at various Christian universities" have been examined in this theory. After the study was conducted the results revealed that "ten of the 11 women described experiences where they perceived being treated differently due to race and/or gender. Qualitative analyses of interview data revealed four themes related to coping: Proactive Coping, External Support, Personal Resources, and Spiritual Coping. The resulting themes are discussed in light of existing research, with an emphasis on the importance of understanding cultural and religious values to the study of coping". Kim, C. L., Hall, M., Anderson, T. L., &amp; Willingham, M. M. (2011). Coping with discrimination in academia: Asian-American and Christian perspectives. Asian American Journal of Psychology, 2(4), 291-305. doi:10.1037/a0025552

==Language==
Another instance of the sociocultural perspective can be found in [[language]] learning literature: “By adopting a sociocultural perspective that highlights the critical role of the social context in cognitive and social development (Vygotsky, 1978), we propose that learners’ actions to facilitate or sometimes constrain their language learning cannot be fully understood without considering the situated contexts in which strategies emerge and develop, as well as the kinds of hierarchies within which studies from diverse backgrounds find themselves in U.S. classrooms (Bourdieu, 1991).

Jimenez, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Theory Into Practice. A Sociocultural Perspective on Second Language Learner Strategies: Focus on the Impact of Social Context. Eun-Young Jang and Robert T. Jimenez 2011, Vol. 50 Issue 2, p141-148. 8p.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31820">'''Spiritual evolution''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]], [[theology|theological]], [[Esoteric knowledge|esoteric]] or [[Spirituality|spiritual]] idea that nature and human beings and/or [[human culture]] evolve: either extending from an established [[esoteric cosmology|cosmological]] [[pattern]] (ascent), or in accordance with certain pre-established potentials. The phrase "spiritual evolution" can occur in the context of "'''higher evolution'''", a term used to differentiate psychological, mental, or spiritual evolution from the "lower" or [[biological evolution]] of physical form.&lt;ref&gt;

The concept of spiritual evolution is also complemented by the idea of a [[creative impulse]] in human beings, known as [[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;

Within this broad definition, theories of spiritual evolution are very diverse. They may be cosmological (describing existence at large), personal (describing development of an individual), or both. They can be [[Holism|holistic]] (holding that higher realities emerge from and are not reducible to the lower), [[Idealism|idealist]] (holding that reality is primarily mental or spiritual) or [[nondual]] (holding that there is no ultimate distinction between mental and physical reality). One can regard all of them as [[teleology|teleological]] to a greater or lesser degree.

Philosophers, scientists, and educators who have proposed theories of spiritual evolution include [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] (1775-1854), [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel | Hegel]] (1770-1831), [[Carl Jung]] (1875-1961), [[Max Théon]] (1848-1927), [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] (1831-1891), [[Henri Bergson]] (1859-1941), [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861-1925), [[Sri Aurobindo]] (1872-1950), [[Jean Gebser]] (1905-1973), [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] (1881-1955), [[Owen Barfield]] (1898-1997), [[Arthur M. Young]] (1905-1995), [[Edward Haskell]] (1906-1986), [[E. F. Schumacher]] (1911-1977), [[Erich Jantsch]] (1929-1980), [[Clare W. Graves]] (1914-1986), [[Alfred North Whitehead]] (1861-1947), [[Terence McKenna]] (1946-2000), and [[P. R. Sarkar]] (1921-1990). {{As of | 2015}} [[William Irwin Thompson]] (born 1938), [[Victor Skumin]] (born 1948), [[Ken Wilber]] (born 1949), and [[Brian Swimme]] (born 1950) work in this field.

==Precursors to the idea==

===The cyclic cosmos===
[[Mircea Eliade]] has suggested that in many pre-modern cultures one finds the concept of the Fall and a "nostalgia for paradise". However, for those cultures that have a [[Cyclic pattern|cyclic]] cosmology, the concept of a progressive deterioration of the universe (as in the [[Hesiod]]ic, [[Hinduism|Hindu]], and [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Lurianic]] cosmologies of a degradation from a [[Golden Age]] to an Iron Age or [[Kali Yuga]]) might be balanced by a corresponding ascent to more spiritual stages and a return to paradisical conditions. This is what one finds in [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and especially [[Jainism|Jain]] cosmologies.

===Emanation===
Many premodern cosmologies and [[esoteric]] systems of thought are based on an [[emanation]]ist view of reality. If the Cyclic view is temporal, then emanation is a non-temporal precursor to the theory of spiritual evolution.

According to this paradigm, Creation proceeds as an outpouring or even a transformation in the original [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] or [[Deity|Godhead]]. The Supreme Light or Consciousness descends through a series of stages, gradations, worlds or [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostases]], becoming progressively more material and embodied, before finally turning around to return to the One, retracing its steps through spiritual knowledge, contemplation and ascent.

A supreme example of this form of thinking is the [[Neoplatonism]] of [[Plotinus]] and his successors. Other examples and interpretations might be found in the Hindu sect of [[Kashmir Shaivism]] and [[Tantra]] in general, [[Gnosticism]], [[Sufism]], and [[Kabbalah]]. The [[Hindu]] idea of the [[Chakra]]s might also considered here as the "microcosmic" counterpart of macrocosmic involution and evolution. The Yogi raises the [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] or life force through and thus transcends each chakra in turn, until he reaches the [[Sahasrara|crown chakra]] and liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Avalon, ''The Serpent Power''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samkhya===
An early example of the doctrine of spiritual evolution is found in [[Samkhya]], one of the six systems of Hindu philosophy, that goes back more than two and a half thousand years (although its present form dates to around the 4th or 5th century c.e.). Unlike most types of classic Hinduism, the traditional Samkhyan philosophy is [[Atheism|atheistic]] and [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualistic]]. Pure spirit (called ''purusha'') comes into proximity with ''prakriti'' (psychophysical nature), disturbing its equilibrium. As a result, the original root-prakriti (''mulaprakriti'') undergoes a series of progressive transformations or unfoldings, in the form of successive essences called ''[[tattva]]s''. The most subtle tattwas emerge first, then progressively grosser ones, each in a particular order, and finally the elements and the organs of sense. The goal of evolution however is, paradoxically, the release of purusha and the return to the unmanifest condition. Hence everything is tending towards a goal of spiritual quiescence.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard J. Larson, (1979) ''Classical Samkhya'' (Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi, 2nd. Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The great chain of being===
The concept of the [[great chain of being]] developed by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] whose ideas were taken up and synthesised by Plotinus. Plotinus in turn heavily influenced [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s theology, and from there [[Aquinas]] and the Scholastics. The Great Chain of Being was an important theme in [[Renaissance]] and [[Elizabethan]] thought, had an under-acknowledged influence on the shaping of the ideas of [[the Enlightenment]] and played a large part in the worldview of 18th century Europe. And while essentially a static worldview, by the 18th and early 19th century it had been "temporalized" by the concept of the [[soul]] ascending or progressing spiritually through the successive rungs or stages, and thus growing or evolving closer to [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur O. Lovejoy (1936), ''The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea'', (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1936, 1961, 1970). {{ISBN|0-674-36153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also had at this time an impact on theories of biological evolution.

[[E. F. Schumacher]], author of ''Small is Beautiful'', has recently proposed a sort of simplified Great Chain of Being, based on the idea of four "[[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]" (mineral, vegetable, animal, human).&lt;ref&gt;E. F. Schumacher (1977), ''A Guide for the Perplexed'', (New York:Harper &amp; Row) {{ISBN|0-06-090611-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumacher rejects modernist and scientific themes, his approach recalling the universalist orientation of writers like [[Huston Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;Huston Smith (1976), ''Forgotten Truth: The Common Vision of the World's Religions'', (New York: Harper &amp; Row), {{ISBN|0-06-250787-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and likely contributing to Ken Wilber's "holonomic" hierarchy or "Great Nest of Being".&lt;ref&gt;Ken Wilber (1996) ''A Brief History of Everything'', (Boston &amp; London: Shambhala Publications, 2nd edition, 2000), {{ISBN|1-57062-740-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{Main article|Buddhism and evolution}}

The concept of spiritual evolution has been taught in [[Buddhism]]. [[William Sturgis Bigelow]] - a [[physician]] and Buddhist - attempted to merge [[biology]] with [[spirituality]]. He accepted the existence of both material and spiritual realms, and many of his ideas were discussed in his book ''Buddhism and Immortality'' (1908). Bigelow used the concept of [[natural selection]] as a mechanism for [[evolution]]. According to the author, spiritual evolution involves an individual emerging from "unconditioned consciousness" and moving "up the scale of evolution guided by natural selection". Then the individual moves to a level of celestial experience, and finally is able to "return to the unconditioned consciousness from which all things emerge". Bigelow accepted both material and spiritual evolution and he also believed that Buddhism and [[science]] were compatible.&lt;ref&gt;American encounter with Buddhism, 1844–1912: Victorian culture &amp; the limits of dissent, Thomas A. Tweed, 2000, pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Low]] a [[Zen master]] and author of ''The Origin of Human Nature: A Zen Buddhist Looks at Evolution'' (2008) opposes [[neo-Darwinism]] and the [[selfish gene theory]] as he claims they are [[materialistic]]. He also opposes [[creationism]] for being dogmatic and instead advocates spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Low, The Origin of Human Nature: A Zen Buddhist Looks at Evolution, Sussex Academic Pr, 2008, {{ISBN|1-84519-260-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Vajrayana]], spiritual evolution is equivalent with the development of the three bodies of [[Trikaya]].

==Occult concepts==
Theories of spiritual evolution are important in many [[Occult]] and [[Esotericism|Esoteric]] teachings, which emphasise the progression and development of the individual either after death ([[spiritualism]]) or through successive [[reincarnation]]s ([[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Hermeticism]]).

===Spiritualism===
{{details|Spiritualism}}

Spiritualists reacted with uncertainty to the theories of [[evolution]] in the late 19th and early 20th century. Broadly speaking, the concept of evolution fit the spiritualist thought of the progressive development of humanity. At the same time, however, a belief in the animal origins of man threatened the foundation of the immortality of the [[spirit]], for if man had not been created, it was scarcely plausible that he would be specially endowed with a spirit. This led to spiritualists embracing spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Oppenheim, The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850–1914, 1988, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, Anglo-American [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualist]] ideas emphasized the progression of the soul after death to higher states of existence, in contrast to [[Spiritism]] which admits to reincarnation.

Spiritualism taught that after death, spirits progressed to new spheres of existence. According to this idea, evolution occurred in the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]] “at a rate more rapid and under conditions more favorable to growth” than encountered on earth.&lt;ref name="Janet Oppenheim 1914, p. 270"&gt;Janet Oppenheim, The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850–1914, 1988, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[biologist]] and spiritualist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1823–1913) believed that qualitative novelties could arise through the process of spiritual evolution, in particular, the phenomena of life and mind. Wallace attributed these novelties to a [[supernatural]] agency.&lt;ref&gt;Debora Hammond, The Science of Synthesis: Exploring the Social Implications of General Systems Theory, 2003, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his life, Wallace was an advocate of spiritualism and believed in an [[wikt:immaterial|immaterial]] origin for the higher mental faculties of humans. He believed that evolution suggested the universe had a purpose, and that certain aspects of living organisms are not explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes. In a 1909 magazine article entitled ''The World of Life'', which he later expanded into a book of the same name&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=World of Life|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S669.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace argued in his 1911 book ''World of life'' for a spiritual approach to evolution and described evolution as “creative power, directive mind and ultimate purpose”. Wallace believed [[natural selection]] could not explain [[intelligence]] or [[morality]] in the human being so suggested that non-material spiritual forces accounted for these. Wallace believed the spiritual nature of man could not have come about by natural selection alone, the origins of the spiritual nature must originate “in the unseen universe of spirit”.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Fichman, An elusive Victorian: the evolution of Alfred Russel Wallace, 2004, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Clodd, Question: A Brief History and Examination of Modern Spiritualism, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Broom]] in his book ''The Coming of Man: Was it Accident or Design?'' (1933) claimed that "spiritual agencies" had guided [[evolution]] as [[animals]] and [[plants]] were too complex to have arisen by chance. According to Broom there were at least two different kinds of spiritual forces, and [[psychics]] are capable of seeing them.&lt;ref&gt;Reconciling science and religion: the debate in the early-twentieth-century Britain, Peter J. Bowler, 2001, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; Broom claimed there was a plan and purpose in evolution and that the origin of [[Homo sapiens]] is the ultimate purpose behind evolution. According to Broom "Much of evolution looks as if it had been planned to result in man, and in other animals and plants to make the world a suitable place for him to dwell in.&lt;ref&gt;Bones of contention: controversies in the search for human origins, Roger Lewin, 1997, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anglo-American position recalls (and is presumably inspired by) 18th century concepts regarding the temporalization of The Great Chain of Being. Spiritual evolution, rather than being a physical (or physico-spiritual) process is based on the idea of realms or stages through which the soul or spirit passes in a non-temporal, qualitative way. This is still an important part of some spiritualist ideas today, and is similar to some mainline (as opposed to [[fundamentalist]]) [[Protestantism|Protestant Christian]] beliefs, according to which after death the person goes to "summerland" (see [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|Spirit world]])

===Theosophical conceptions===
{{See also|Theosophy and science#Theosophical evolutionism}}
[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] presents a more sophisticated and complex cosmology than Spiritualism, although coming out of the same general milieu. [[H. P. Blavatsky]] developed a highly original cosmology, according to which the human race (both collectively and through the succession of individual reincarnation and spiritual evolution) passes through a number of [[Root Race]]s, beginning with the huge ethereal and mindless Polarian or First Root Race, through the Lemurian (3rd), Atlantean (4th) and our present "Aryan" 5th Race. This will give rise to a future, Post-Aryan 6th Root Race of highly spiritual and enlightened beings that will arise in [[Baja California]] in the 28th century, and an even more sublime 7th Root Race, before ascending to totally superhuman and cosmic states of existence.

Blavatsky's ideas were further developed by her successors, such as [[C.W. Leadbeater]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Alice Bailey]], [[Benjamin Creme]], and [[Victor Skumin]] each of whom went into huge detail in constructing baroque cycles of rounds, races, and sub-races. Skumin elaborated on the theosophical conceptions of spiritual evolution, he proposed a [[definition]] and classification of '''''Homo spiritalis''''' ([[Latin]]: "spiritual man"), [[Root race#the sixth root race|the sixth root race]], consisting of eight sub-races (subspecies): HS0 Anabiosis spiritalis, HS1 Scientella spiritalis, HS2 Aurora spiritalis, HS3 Ascensus spiritalis, HS4 Vocatus spiritalis, HS5 Illuminatio spiritalis, НS6 Creatio spiritalis, and HS7 Servitus spiritalis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Victor Skumin|Skumin]] |first=V. A. |script-title=ru: Человек духовный: роль культуры духовного здоровья в утверждении новой человеческой расы на планете |trans-title=Spiritual man: The role of the Culture of spiritual health for approval of the new human race on the planet |year=1996 |publisher=theeuropeanlibrary.org |url= http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/record/3000010564370?query=%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80+%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD+ |language=Russian |isbn=5-88167-012-4 |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although including elements of the science of her day as well as both eastern and western esoteric thought, Blavatsky rejected the [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] idea that man evolved from apes, and most subsequent esotericists followed this lead. Darwinism, with its explanation of evolution through material factors like [[natural selection]] and random mutation, does not sit well with many spiritual evolutionists, for whom evolution is initiated or guided by metaphysical principles or is tending towards a [[Teleology|final spiritual or divine state]].  It is believed by Theosophists that humans are evolving ''spiritually'' through a series of esoteric [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiations]] and in the future humans will become esoteric [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|masters]] themselves as their [[soul]]s gradually rise upward through the [[Spiritual Hierarchy|spiritual hierarchy]] over the course of eons as they reincarnate.

Despite this, recent Theosophists and [[Anthroposophy|Anthroposophists]] have tried to incorporate the facts of geology and paleontology into their cosmology and spiritual evolution (in Anthroposophy [[Hermann Poppelbaum]] is a particularly creative thinker in this regard). Some have attempted to equate [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] with [[Gondwana]]land, for example. Today all these ideas have little influence outside their specialised followings, but for a time Theosophical concepts were immensely influential.  Theosophy-like teachings also continue today in a group of religions based on Theosophy called the [[Ascended Master Teachings]].

===Theurgy===
[[Theurgy]] has a clear relationship to [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Kabbalah]] and contains the concept of spiritual evolution{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} and ultimately unification with [[God]] or the [[Deity|Godhead]] at its core. Theurgy is considered by many to be another term for high magic and is known to have influenced the members of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] many of whom considered the order to be Theurgic in nature. [[Aleister Crowley]] also considered his [[Thelemic]] system of magical philosophy to be a Theurgic tradition as it emphasized the [[Great Work]], which is essentially another form of spiritual evolution. The Great Work is believed to result in communication with one's personal [[angel]] or [[higher self]].

==Epigenesis==
Epigenesis is the [[philosophical]]/[[theology|theological]]/[[Esoteric knowledge|esoteric]] idea that since the [[mind]] was given to the human being, it is the original creative impulse, epigenesis, which has been the cause of all of [[Human|mankind]]'s development.

According to spiritual evolution, humans build upon that which has already been created, but add new elements because of the activity of the spirit.  Humans have the capacity, therefore, to become creative intelligences&amp;mdash;[[Creativity|creators]]. For a human to fulfill this promise, his training should allow for the exercise of originality, which distinguishes creation from [[imitation]]. When epigenesis becomes inactive, in the individual or even in a race, evolution ceases and [[degeneration]] commences.

This concept is based on the [[Rosicrucian]] view of the world as a training school, which posits that while mistakes are made in life, humans often learn more from mistakes than successes.  Suffering is considered as merely the result of error, and the impact of suffering on the [[consciousness]] causes humans to be active along other lines which are found to be [[Goodness and value theory|good]], in [[harmony]] with [[nature]]. Humans are seen as spirits attending the school of life for the purpose of unfolding latent spiritual power, developing themselves from ''impotence'' to [[omnipotence]] (related also to development from [[innocence]] into [[virtue]]), reaching the stage of creative gods at the end of mankind's present evolution: ''Great Day of Manifestation''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Heindel]], ''[[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception]]: Involution, Evolution and Epigenesis'', November 1909, {{ISBN|0-911274-34-0}} [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rcc/rcceng14.htm#par67 www]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution towards Godhead==

===A common vision===
[[Sri Aurobindo]] and [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] both describe a progression from inanimate matter to a future state of Divine consciousness. Teilhard de Chardin refers to this as the [[Omega Point]], and Sri Aurobindo as the [[Supermind (Integral thought)|Supermind]].&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977) ''The Life Divine'', (Sri Aurobindo Ashram Trust), {{ISBN|0-941524-62-0}} (hardcover), {{ISBN|0-941524-61-2}} (paperback)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1955), ''The Phenomenon of Man'', (New York:Harper &amp; Row), {{ISBN|0-06-090495-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teilhard de Chardin===
Teilhard, who was a [[Jesuit]] [[Paleontology|Paleontologist]] who played an important role in the discovery of [[Peking Man]], presented a teleological view of planetary and cosmic evolution, according to which the formation of atoms, molecules and inanimate matter is followed by the development of the [[biosphere]] and organic evolution, then the appearance of man and the [[noosphere]] as the total envelope of human thought. According to Teilhard evolution does not cease here but continues on to its culmination and unification in the Omega Point, which he identifies with [[Christ]].

===Meher Baba's "involution"===
[[Meher Baba]] has used the term [[God Speaks#Involution|involution]] to describe the inner journey of consciousness after transcending the physical or gross state up to the attainment of Self-consciousness, or merging with God. According to Meher Baba, the consciousness of the soul in duality first goes through the long process of evolution of form, then, upon reaching the human form, consciousness enters the process of ''reincarnation'', and finally reaches the process of ''involution'', which culminates in ''[[God-realization (Meher Baba)|God-realization]]''.

==Surat Shabda Yoga==
[[Surat Shabd Yoga|Surat Shabda Yoga]] [[esoteric cosmology]] depicts the whole of creation (the [[macrocosm]]) as being [[Emanationism|emanated]] and arranged in a spiritually differentiated hierarchy, often referred to as eggs, regions, or [[Plane (cosmology)|planes]]. Typically, eight spiritual levels are described above the physical plane, although names and subdivisions within these levels will vary to some extent by mission and Master. (One version of the creation from a Surat Shabda Yoga perspective is depicted at the Sant Ajaib Singh Ji Memorial Site in [http://www.santji.allegre.ca/planes-640.jpg “The Grand Scheme of All Creation”].)

The constitution of the individual (the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]]) is an exact replica of the macrocosm. Consequently, the microcosm consists of a number of [[Subtle body|bodies]], each one suited to interact with its corresponding plane or region in the macrocosm. These bodies developed over the [[yuga]]s through [[Involution (esoterism)|involution]] ([[Emanationism|emanating]] from higher planes to lower planes) and evolution (returning from lower planes to higher planes), including by [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]] in various [[altered state of consciousness|states]] of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Holtje (1995) ''[http://www.masterpath.org/masterpath_books/index.htm From Light to Sound: The Spiritual Progression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051105042502/http://www.masterpath.org/masterpath_books/index.htm |date=2005-11-05 }}''.

==Dynamic evolution through successive kingdoms==
[[Arthur M. Young]] and [[Edward Haskell]] have each independently incorporated the findings of science into a larger theory of spiritual evolution, and extended the traditional human, animal, vegetable, and mineral categories with kingdoms representing [[photon]]s, [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name=young76&gt;Arthur M. Young (1976), ''The Reflexive Universe&amp;nbsp;– Evolution of Consciousness'' (Delacorte Press), {{ISBN|0-440-05924-0}}; Anodos Foundation 1999 revised edition, {{ISBN|1-892160-11-0}} (paperback), {{ISBN|1-892160-10-2}} (hardcover) see diagram pp.86-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Haskell (1972) ''[http://www.synearth.net/Haskell/FC/ Full Circle; the Moral Force of Unified Science]'', ed. by Edward Haskell (Gordon and Breach, New York, London &amp; Paris)&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur M. Young goes further in considering the human state as a subset of a larger kingdom of "Dominion", of which the sixth stage is represented for example by Christ and Buddha, and the seventh (final) stage an even higher level of Enlightenment or God-realisation.&lt;ref name=young76/&gt; Moreover, both Haskell and Young present profound accounts of evolution through these kingdoms in terms of [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] principles. A more "mainstream" scientific presentation of this same idea is provided by [[Erich Jantsch]] in his account of how self-organising systems evolve and develop as a series of "[[symmetry breaking|symmetry break]]s" through the sequence of matter, life, and mind.&lt;ref name="jantsch"&gt;Erich Jantsch (1980), The Self Organizing Universe&amp;nbsp;– Scientific and Human Implication of the Emerging Paradigm of Evolution (New York: Pergamon), {{ISBN|0-08-024312-6}}, p.224&lt;/ref&gt; Although abiding strictly by the understanding of science, Jantsch arranges the various elements of cosmic, planetary, biological, psychological, and human evolution in a single overall framework of [[emergent evolution]] that may or may not be considered teleological.&lt;ref name=jantsch/&gt;

==New Age ideas==
[[New Age]] thought is strongly syncretic. A common theme is the evolution or the transcendence of the human or collective planetary consciousness in a higher state or higher "vibratory" (a metaphor taken from [[G. I. Gurdjieff]]) level.

David Spangler's communications speak of a "New Heaven and a new Earth", while [[Christopher Hills]] refers (perhaps influenced by Sri Aurobindo) to
the divinization of man.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hills (1977) ''Nuclear Evolution&amp;nbsp;– Discovery of the Rainbow Body'' (university of Trees Press, Boulder Creek, CA) 2nd ed. p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jonathan Livingston Seagull]]'' narrated the idea of evolution in a fascinating fashion. [[James Redfield]] in his novel ''[[The Celestine Prophecy]]'' suggested that through experiencing a series of personal spiritual insights, humanity is becoming aware of the connection between our evolution and the Divine. More recently in his book ''God and the Evolving Universe: The Next Step in Personal Evolution'' (2002) co-written with [[Michael Murphy (author)|Michael Murphy]], he claims that humanity is on the verge of undergoing a change in [[higher consciousness|consciousness]].

==Integral theory and spiral dynamics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
An interpretation of social and psychological development that could also be considered a theory of spiritual evolution is [[spiral dynamics]], based on the work of [[Clare W. Graves]].

More recently the concept of spiritual evolution has been given a sort of respectability it has not had since the early 19th century through the work of the [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)|integral theorist]] [[Ken Wilber]], in whose writings both the cosmological and the personal dimensions are described. In this [[Integral movement|integral philosophy]] (inspired in part by the works of Plotinus, Hegel, Sri Aurobindo, Eric Jantsch, and many others) reality is said to consist of several realms or stages, including more than one of the following: the physical, the vital, the psychic, (after the Greek ''psyche'', "soul"), the causal (referring to "that which causes, or gives rise to, the manifest world"), and the ultimate (or non-dual), through which the individual progressively evolves. Although this schema is derived in large part from [[Tibetan Buddhism]], Wilber argues (and uses many tables of diagrams to show) that these same levels of being are common to all wisdom teachings. Described simplistically, Wilber sees humans developing through several stages, including [[Magic and religion|magic]], [[mythology|mythic]], pluralistic, and [[holism|holistic]] mentalities. But he also sees cultures as developing through these stages. And, much like Hegel, he sees this development of individuals and cultures ''as'' the evolution of existence itself. Wilber has also teamed up with [[Don Beck (management consultant)|Don Beck]] to integrate Spiral Dynamics into his own Integral philosophy, and vice versa. Spiral Dynamics posits a series of stages through which human's cultural development progresses&amp;nbsp;– from a survival-based hunter-gatherer stage to a magical-tribal-agrarian stage to a city-building-invading stage to a mythic-religious-empire stage to a rational-scientific-capitalist stage to a green-holistic-inclusive stage and then ascending to a second tier where all the previous stages are contemplated and integrated and a third transpersonal tier where a spiritual unity or Omega point is eventually reached, which all the other stages are struggling to embody. He feels that individuals in each of the meme-plexes/stages can ascend to the peak of consciousness&amp;nbsp;– these being the prophets, visionaries and leaders of any region/age.

In [[celestial mechanics]], the term '''stationary orbit''' refers to an orbit around a planet or moon where the orbiting satellite or [[spacecraft]] remains orbiting over the same spot on the surface. From the ground, the satellite would appear to be standing still, hovering above the surface in the same spot, day after day.&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;
   "Space Today Online - Answers To Your Questions",
   Spacetoday.org, 2010, webpage:
   [http://www.spacetoday.org/Questions/PolarSats.html ST-Sats].
&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, this is accomplished by matching the rotation of the surface below, by reaching a particular altitude where the orbital speed almost matches the rotation below, in an equatorial orbit.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt; As the speed decreases slowly, then an additional boost would be needed to increase the speed back to a matching speed, or a [[retro-rocket]] could be fired to slow the speed when too fast. 

The stationary-orbit region of space is known as the [[Clarke Belt]], named after British science fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]], who published the idea in ''[[Wireless World]]'' magazine in 1945.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt; A stationary orbit is sometimes referred to as a "fixed orbit".

==Stationary Earth orbit==
{{main|Geostationary orbit}}
Around the [[Earth]], stationary satellites orbit at altitudes of approximately {{convert|22,300|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt; Writing in 1945, the science-fiction author [[Arthur C. Clarke]] imagined [[communications satellite]]s as travelling in stationary orbits, where those satellites would travel around the Earth at the same speed the globe is spinning, making them hover stationary over one spot on the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;

A satellite being propelled into place, into a stationary orbit, is first fired to a special equatorial orbit called a "[[geostationary transfer orbit]]" (GTO).&lt;ref name=ST/&gt; Within this oval-shaped ([[elliptical]]) orbit, the satellite will alternately swing out to {{convert|22,300|mi|km|-1}} high and then back down to an altitude of only {{convert|100|mi|km}} above the Earth (223 times closer). Then, at a planned time and place, an attached "kick motor" will push the satellite out to maintain an even, circular orbit at the 22,300-mile altitude.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;

==Stationary Mars orbit==
{{main|areostationary orbit}}
An ''areostationary orbit'' or ''areosynchronous equatorial orbit'' (abbreviated ''AEO'') is a circular [[areosynchronous orbit|areo&amp;shy;synchronous orbit]] in the [[Mars|Martian]] [[equator|equatorial plane]] about {{convert|20428|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the surface, any point on which revolves about Mars in the same direction and with the same [[orbital period|period]] as the Martian surface. Areo&amp;shy;stationary orbit is a concept similar to Earth's [[geostationary orbit|geo&amp;shy;stationary orbit]]. The prefix ''areo-'' derives from [[Ares]], the ancient Greek god of war and counterpart to the Roman god Mars, with whom the planet was identified. The modern Greek word for Mars is {{lang|el|Άρης}} ({{transl|el|Áris}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8094">{{For|the collection of information officially organized with the SNOMED system|SNOMED CT}}

The '''Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine''' ('''SNOMED''') is a systematic, computer-processable collection of [[medical terms]], in human and [[veterinary medicine]], to provide codes, terms, synonyms and definitions which cover [[anatomy]], [[diseases]], findings, procedures, [[microorganisms]], substances, etc. It allows a consistent way to index, store, retrieve, and aggregate medical data across specialties and sites of care. Although now international, SNOMED was started in the [[United States|U.S.]] by the [[College of American Pathologists]] (CAP)&lt;ref name=Design/&gt; in 1973 and revised into the 1990s. In 2002 CAP's SNOMED Reference Terminology (SNOMED RT) was merged with, and expanded by, the [[National Health Service]]'s Clinical Terms Version 3 (previously known as the [[Read codes]]) to produce SNOMED CT.&lt;ref name="NLM-UMLS-add"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_announcement.html |title=SNOMED Clinical Terms To Be Added To UMLS Metathesaurus |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] |date=24 May 2006 |accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NLM-SNOMED-FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_faq.html |title=FAQs: SNOMED CT in the UMLS |publisher=United States National Library of Medicine |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Versions of SNOMED released prior to 2001 were based on a multiaxial, [[hierarchical]] classification system.&lt;ref name=Design&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roger A. Côté |year=1986| title=Architecture of SNOMED|journal=Proceedings of the Annual Symposium on Computer Application in Medical Care|pages=74–80|pmc=2245000}}
&lt;/ref&gt; As in any such system, a disease may be located in a body [[organ (anatomy)]], which results in a code in a topography axis and may lead to [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] alterations represented by a morphology code.

In 2002 the first release of [[SNOMED CT]] adopted a completely different structure. A sub-type hierarchy, supported by defining relationships based on description logic, replaced the axes described in this article. Versions of SNOMED prior to SNOMED CT are planned to be formally deprecated from 2017.&lt;ref name=Deprecate&gt;[http://www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-ct/history0/ Deprecation of Antecedent Versions of SNOMED by IHTSDO General Assembly]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, readers interested in current information about SNOMED are directed to the article on [[SNOMED CT]].

==Purpose==
SNOMED was designed as a comprehensive [[nomenclature]] of clinical medicine for the purpose of accurately storing and/or retrieving records of clinical care in human and [[veterinary medicine]].
The metaphor used by [[Roger A. Côté]], the first editorial chair, was that SNOMED would become the [[periodic table of elements]] of medicine because of its definitional organization beyond the hierarchical design.  Indeed, diseases and procedures were ordered hierarchically and are further referenced back to more elementary terms (see Reference Ontology and Multi-Axial Design, below).

==History==
SNOMED was originally conceived by Côté as an extension of the design of the Systematized Nomenclature of Pathology (SNOP) applicable for all medicine. SNOP was originally designed by Arnold Pratt to describe pathological specimens according to their morphology and anatomy (topography). The ambitious development of SNOMED required many more axes (see multi-axial design, below). SNOMED was jointly proposed for development to the [[College of American Pathologists]] by Côté and Pratt. The former was appointed as editorial chair of the Committee on Nomenclature and Classification of Diseases of the CAP and developed the SNOMED from 1973 to 1997. In 1998,  [[Kent Spackman]] was appointed to chair this committee and spearheaded the transformation of the multi-axis systems into a highly computable form (See [[SNOMED CT]]): a [[directed acyclic graph]] anchored in formal representation logic. In 2007, the newly formed [[International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation]] ([[IHTSDO]]) acquired all the Intellectual Property of [[SNOMED CT]] and all antecedent SNOMED versions.

Brief timeline:
* 1965 SNOP
* 1974 SNOMED
* 1979 SNOMED II
* 1993 SNOMED International 3.0
* 1995 [[SNOMED Microglossary of Signs and Symptoms]]
* 1993-98 SNOMED International versions 3.1-3.5
* 2002 First release of [[SNOMED CT]]
* 2007 All versions of SNOMED acquired by [[IHTSDO]]
* 2017 All SNOMED versions except [[SNOMED CT]] will be formally deprecated by [[IHTSDO]]

==Reference ontology==
SNOMED was designed from its inception with complex concepts defined in terms of simpler ones. For example, a disease can be defined in terms of its abnormal anatomy, abnormal functions and [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. In some cases, the [[etiology]] of the disease is known and can be attributed to an infectious agent, a physical trauma or a chemical or pharmaceutical agent.

==Multi-axial design==

The current concept uses eleven (11) axes that comprise terms organised in hierarchical trees. The axes and some examples are provided below:

=== T (Topography) &amp;ndash; Anatomic terms===

* (T-28000) [[Lung]]
* (T-32000) [[Heart]]
* (T-51000) [[Mouth]]
* (T-D2500) [[Hip]]
* (T-D9600) [[Heel]]

=== M (Morphology) &amp;ndash; Changes found in cells, tissues and organs===
* (M-40000) [[Inflammation]]
* (M-44000) [[Granuloma]]
* (M-54700) [[Infarcted]]
* (M-54701) [[Microscopic infarct]]

''For the Morphology axis, SNOMED has [http://www.snomed.org/clinical/anatomic.html agreed] to collaborate and use the same harmonized codes shared with  [[International Classification of Diseases for Oncology]]. Additional examples on topology are provided on that page.''

=== L (Living organisms) &amp;ndash; Bacteria and viruses===
* (L-21801) [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]
* (L-25116) [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]

=== C (Chemical) &amp;ndash; Drugs===
* (C-C137A) [[Bufferin]] [[Analgesic]] [[Tablet (pharmacy)|Tablets]]
* (C-C137B) [[Bufferin]] [[Analgesic]] [[Tablet (pharmacy)#Caplet|Caplets]]

=== F (Function) &amp;ndash; Signs and symptoms===
* (F-03003) [[Fever]]

=== J (Occupation) &amp;ndash; Terms that describe the occupation===
* Kindergarten teacher (13420)
* Computer programmer (08420)
* Doctor (06105)
* Professional Nurse (General) (07110)
* Beautician (57040)

=== D (Diagnosis) &amp;ndash; Diagnostic terms===
* (D-13510) [[Pneumococcal pneumonia]]
* (D-14800) [[Tuberculosis]]
* (D3-15000) [[Myocardial infarction]]

=== P (Procedure) &amp;ndash; Administrative, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4836">'''Theatrum Mundi''' (or the Great Theater of the World) is a metaphorical concept developed throughout Western literature and thought, apparent in theories of the world such as [[Plato | Plato's]] [[Allegory of the Cave]], and a popular idea in the [[Baroque Period]] among certain writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoffmeister |first=Gerhart |date=March 2009 |title=World as a Stage - Theatrum Mundi |journal=The Literary Encyclopedia. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This metaphysical explanation of the world portrays the world as a theater (apparent in Shakespeare's saying that "all the world's a stage") wherein people are characters and their actions form a drama, with God as the author, specifically for some [[Christian]] thinkers. This metaphor can take various forms, some more [[Determinism|deterministic]] than others, and has also been formulated in different fashions, such as the world as chess game by the Persian philosopher [[Omar Khayyam]]. In each formulation of the ''theatrum mundi'', though, the world is a sum greater than its parts, where various roles are played by different actors.

==History==

The world as a stage was expressed among the ancient Greeks, and especially gained popularity among [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and [[Neoplatonism|Neoplantonist]] philosophers such as [[Plotinus]] in the [[late antiquity]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. In Neoplatonism, which went on to influence Christianity, the belief of the separate realm of the soul and its transcendence above the instability of worldly affairs influenced philosophers and later, important Christian figures like [[St. Augustine]] to view the world as a theatrical spectacle. 

The relation of God to humanity and the world was expressed throughout the Middle Ages. [[John of Salisbury]], a 12th-century theologian especially coined the term ''theatrum mundi'', characterized by commenting that saints "despise the theater of this world from the heights of their virtue". In several chapters of the third book of his ''[[Policraticus]]'', a moral encyclopedia, he meditates on the fact that "the life of man on earth is a comedy, where each forgetting his own plays another's role". The comedy takes place on the scene/in the world, while the ''auditorium'' is associated to the Christian paradise. Only a few sages, like some Stoic philosophers or the prophets like [[Abraham]] or [[John the Baptist|John the Baptiste]], are able to accept the role given by God. This acceptation allows to extract themselves from the ''theatrum mundi'', to adopt a celestial position in the ''auditorium'', and to watch and understand the roles played in the comedy&lt;ref&gt;John Gillies, ''Shakespeare and the Geography of Difference'', Volume 4 of Cambridge Studies in Renaissance Literature and Culture, Cambridge University Press, 1994. {{ISBN|9780521458535}}. [https://books.google.ca/books?id=HoKybxnJLVMC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76 Pages 76-77].&lt;/ref&gt;.

The metaphor had intercourse with the actual theater, which could be conversely conceived as a world, or a microcosm. The idea continued to be expressed throughout the early modern period and became less of a strictly theological or philosophical metaphor and began to insert itself in various forms of literature and rhetorical expressions, and its use in certain times has been theorized to be a result of political and religious alienation, especially in the midst of tumultuous historical periods. It is possible that it gradually began to lose its religious connotations, and the ''theatrum mundi'' took on more of a secular, political aspect. But going back to Plato's emphasis in ''Laws'' of a protagonist embodying the ideal political subject by reflecting the ideal plane, this both political and theological formulation of ''theatrum mundi''was eventually propagated by [[Tertullian]] to the point where the sociological idea of [[role (sociology)|roles]] descends from it as well. Additionally, it was also cultivated by the transition towards new social forms; for instance, the trappings of the feudal monarchy in England was seen as "empty" and "theatrical" because they occurred in the social context of an ascendant capitalism. It was in England, moreover, where the metaphor was the most developed, although it was also refined in Spain.

Transforming with the developments of philosophy and culture, the ''theatrum mundi'' became less popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, but more recently reconceptualizations have developed among [[Situationists]] and [[Jean Baudrillard]], as well as [[Brecht]], [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]], and [[Artaud]].

The '''ticking time bomb scenario''' is a [[thought experiment]] that has been used in the [[ethics]] debate over whether [[torture]] can ever be justified. As a thought experiment, there is no need that the scenario be plausible; it need only serve to highlight ethical considerations. The scenario can be formulated as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose that a person with knowledge of an imminent [[terrorism|terrorist attack]], that will kill many people, is in the hands of the authorities and that he will disclose the information needed to prevent the attack only if he is tortured. Should he be tortured?&lt;ref name="APT"&gt;[http://www.apt.ch/content/files_res/tickingbombscenario.pdf Defusing the Ticking Bomb Scenario: Why we must say No to torture, Always], [[Association for the Prevention of Torture]], September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The scenario can be better understood through the arguments of those who respond to it; the [[consequentialist]] argument is that nations, even those that legally disallow torture, can justify its use if they have a terrorist in custody who possesses critical knowledge, such as the location of a [[time bomb]] or a [[weapon of mass destruction]] that will soon explode and cause great loss of life. Opponents to the argument usually begin by exposing certain assumptions that tend to be hidden by initial presentations of the scenario and tend to obscure the true costs of permitting torture in "real-life" scenarios—e.g., the assumption that the person is in fact a terrorist, whereas in real life there usually remains uncertainty about whether the person is in fact a terrorist and that he has useful information&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spino|first1=	Joseph|last2=Dellarosa Cummins|first2=Denise|title=The Ticking Time Bomb: When the Use of Torture Is and Is Not Endorsed|journal=Review of Philosophy and Psychology|date=August 2014|volume=5|pages=543–563|doi=10.1007/s13164-014-0199-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and rely on legal, philosophical/moral, and empirical grounds to reaffirm the need for the absolute prohibition of torture.  There is also uncertainty about the [[effectiveness of torture]], and much opposition to torture is based on the fact it is not effective rather than any moral issue.

==Background==

Philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] has been regarded as the "father" of the ticking time bomb argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.19.bbk.ac.uk/articles/10.16995/ntn.643/|title=The Fire-Raisers: Bentham and Torture|first=Jeremy|last=Davies|date=1 December 2012|publisher=|doi=10.16995/ntn.643}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in his 1804 essay ''Means of extraction for extraordinary occasions'':

{{quote|Suppose an occasion to arise, in which a suspicion is entertained, as strong as that which would be received as a sufficient ground for arrest and commitment as for felony — a suspicion that at this very time a considerable number of individuals are actually suffering, by illegal violence inflictions equal in intensity to those which if inflicted by the hand of justice, would universally be spoken of under the name of torture. For the purpose of rescuing from torture these hundred innocents, should any scruple be made of applying equal or superior torture, to extract the requisite information from the mouth of one criminal, who having it in his power to make known the place where at this time the enormity was practicing or about to be practiced, should refuse to do so?}}

The concept was popularized in the 1960s in the novel ''[[Les Centurions]]'' by [[Jean Lartéguy]] which is set during the [[Algerian war]]. The version in the novel has the following conditions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Twining|first1=WL|last2=Twining|first2=PE|title=Bentham on torture|journal=N. Ir. LQ|date=1973|volume=24|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The evidence in support of the contention that he has the relevant information would satisfy the requirements of evidence for convicting him of an offence.
# There are reasonable grounds for believing that he is likely to tell the truth if severe torture is threatened, and, if necessary, applied to him.
# There are reasonable grounds for believing that no other means would have the effect of compelling him to tell the truth.
# There are grounds for believing that if the information is obtained quickly, there is a good chance of defusing the bomb before it goes off.
# There are reasonable grounds for believing that the likely damage to be caused by the bomb will include death of many citizens, the maiming of others, including the infliction of much more severe pain on others with much more lasting effect than will be the effect of the infliction of torture on the person who has been captured;
# There are reasonable grounds for believing that the torturing will not have consequences which would be worse than the damage likely to result from the bomb going off.
According to [[Darius Rejali]], a professor of political science at [[Reed College]], the possibility of sudden, massive destruction of innocent life provided French liberals with a more acceptable justification for committing torture.&lt;ref name="Mayer"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/070219fa_fact_mayer | title=Whatever it takes.

==Views in favor of accepting torture in emergencies==
[[Alan Dershowitz]], a prominent American defense attorney, surprised some observers by giving limited support to the idea that torture could be justified. He argued that human nature can lead to unregulated abuse "off the books". Therefore, it would be better if there were a regulated procedure through which an interrogator could request a "torture warrant" and that requiring a warrant would establish a paper trail of accountability. Torturers, and those who authorize torture, could be held to account for excesses. Dershowitz's suggested torture warrants, similar to search warrants, arrest warrants and phone tap warrants, would spell out the limits on the techniques that interrogators may use, and the extent to which they may abridge a suspect's rights.

In September 2002, when reviewing Alan Dershowitz's book, ''Why Terrorism Works: Understanding the Threat, Responding to the Challenge'', [[Richard Posner]], legal scholar and judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, wrote in ''[[The New Republic]]'', "If torture is the only means of obtaining the information necessary to prevent the detonation of a [[nuclear bomb]] in [[Times Square]], torture should be used--and will be used--to obtain the information.... No one who doubts that this is the case should be in a position of responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/review/2002_09_05.html|title=Review-a-Day - Why Terrorism Works Understanding The by  Alan M Dershowitz, reviewed by The New Republic Online - Powell's Books|work=powells.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023012718/http://www.powells.com/review/2002_09_05.html|archivedate=2012-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views in favor of torturing the relatives of suspects===
In February 2010 [[Bruce Anderson (columnist)|Bruce Anderson]] wrote a column for ''[[The Independent]]'', arguing that the British government would have not just the right, but the duty, to torture if there was a ticking bomb, and that they should torture the relatives of suspects if they believed that doing so would yield information that would avert a terrorist attack: "It came, in the form of a devilish intellectual challenge. 'Let's take your hypothesis a bit further. We have captured a terrorist, but he is a hardened character. We cannot be certain that he will crack in time. We have also captured his wife and children'. After much agonising, I have come to the conclusion that there is only one answer to [[Sydney Kentridge]]'s question. [[collective punishment|Torture the wife and children]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/bruce-anderson/bruce-anderson-we-not-only-have-a-right-to-use-torture-we-have-a-duty-1899555.html We not only have a right to use torture. We have a duty], Bruce Anderson, ''[[The Independent]]'', 16 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views rejecting torture under all circumstances==
Some human rights organizations, professional and academic experts, and military and intelligence leaders have absolutely rejected the idea that torture is ever legal or acceptable, even in a so-called ticking bomb situation.&lt;ref name="APT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt; They have expressed grave concern about the way the dramatic force and artificially simple moral answers the ticking bomb thought-experiment seems to offer, have manipulated and distorted the legal and moral perceptions, reasoning and judgment of both the general population and military and law enforcement officials. They reject the proposition, implicit or explicit, that certain acts of torture are justifiable, even desirable. They believe that simplistic responses to the scenario may lead well-intentioned societies down a slippery slope to legalized and systematic torture. They point out that no evidence of any real-life situation meeting all the criteria to constitute a pure ticking bomb scenario has ever been presented to the public, and that such a situation is highly unlikely.{{efn|Interviewed on ''Face the Nation'' in May 2009, former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] cited [[CIA]] memos that gave two examples supporting the use of [[enhanced interrogation techniques]] in a ticking bomb scenario, claiming that the interrogation of [[Abu Zubaydah]] prevented a plot to detonate a ''[[dirty bomb]]'' in [[Washington DC]] and similarly that information forced from [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] prevented an attack on [[Los Angeles]]. These claims were later repeated in August 2009 during a FOX news interview and are still cited as valid examples. However, in 2008, the claims made in the 2007 CIA memos were investigated by the [[U.S. Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]'s Office of Professional Responsibility and heavily criticized. The Department of Justice report, released in February 2009, stated that Zubaydah had supplied the information before he was tortured and that no further credible information had been obtained from the torture itself. In the case of Mohammed, the attack on Los Angeles had already been exposed before his capture and his admissions under torture were little more than white noise given to end it.}}

As well, torture can be criticized as a poor vehicle for discovering truth, as people experiencing torture, once broken, are liable to make anything up in order to stop the pain and can become unable to tell the difference between fact and fiction under intense psychological pressure. Additionally, since the terrorist presumably knows that the timer is ticking, he has an excellent reason to lie and give false information under torture in order to misdirect his interrogators; merely giving a convincing answer which the investigators will waste time checking out makes it more likely that the bomb will go off, and of course once the bomb has gone off, not only has the terrorist won, but there is also no further point in torturing him, except perhaps as revenge.

Others point out that the ticking-bomb torture proponents adopt an extremely short-term view, which impoverishes their [[consequentialism]]. Using torture—or even declaring that one is prepared to accept its use—makes other groups of people much more likely to use torture themselves in the long run. The consequence is likely to be a long-term increase in violence. This long-term effect is so serious that the person making the torture decision cannot possibly (according to this argument) make a reasonable estimate of its results. Thus the decision-maker has no grounds for certainty that the value of the lives saved from the ticking bomb will outweigh the value of the lives lost because of the subsequent disorder. He or she cannot arrive at a successful accounting of consequences.

This anti-torture argument, in fact, works by positing that human knowledge has intrinsic limits. An analogous argument holds that human decision-makers are fundamentally prone in certain situations to believe that their judgment is better than it is, and that, to be ethical, they must pre-commit themselves to a particular course of action in those situations. Knowing that, under stress, they will never be able to accurately assess the likely success of torture in obtaining information needed to prevent an attack, humans thus pre-commit to not torture. In general, this family of arguments faults the "ticking-bomb" scenario for implicitly including an incorrect presumption that the decision-maker can know in advance the outcome of torture, either in the short run (likelihood that it will prevent an attack) or the long run (likelihood that it will not set off a general increase in human violence).

[[Joe Navarro]], one of the [[FBI]]’s top experts in questioning techniques, told [[The New Yorker]]:

{{quote|Only a [[psychopath]] can torture and be unaffected. You don’t want people like that in your organization. They are untrustworthy, and tend to have grotesque other problems.&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/the-politics-of-torture-scenes-on-24-shame-on-you-for-your-lies-joel-surnow "The Politics Of TV Torture Shown On '24' - Shame On You For Your Lies, Joel Surnow"] by Nikki Finke, ''[[LA Weekly]]'', February 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-military-tells-jack-bauer-cut-out-the-torture-scenes--or-else-436143.html "US Military Tells Jack Bauer: Cut Out the Torture Scenes ... or Else!"] by Andrew Buncombe, ''[[The Independent]]'', February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]], which was adopted on December 10, 1984, and entered into force on June 26, 1987, explicitly states in Article 2.2 that:

{{quote|No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of [[war]] or a threat of war, internal [[failed state|political instability]] or any other [[state of emergency|public emergency]], may be invoked as a justification of torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/39/a39r046.htm|title=A/RES/39/46.  Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Implausibility===
Critics of the thought experiment scenario maintain that it is essentially implausible, based on simultaneous presence of numerous unlikely factors. This is particularly acute in fictional exploration of the scenario.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

For example, in perhaps the most common variants on the scenario, one must assume that torturers know, with a reasonable degree of certainty that some form of deadly attack is imminent, but lack a crucial component of that plan, such as its precise location.  They must also have in their custody someone who they are reasonably certain has said information and would talk under torture or threat of torture.  They must then be able to accurately distinguish between true and false information which the subject may supply under torture.  They must then be able to use this information to form a plan of response which is effective at stopping the planned attack.  All of this must occur within a limited time frame allowed by the "ticking bomb".

==Effect of fiction==
Works of fiction, such as the television series ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', often rely on ticking time bomb scenarios for dramatic effect. According to the [[Parents Television Council]], given that each season represents a 24-hour period, [[Jack Bauer]] encounters someone who needs [[Critical reaction to 24 (TV series)#Torture|torturing]] to reveal a ticking bomb on average 12 times per day.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite web | last = Lithwick | first = Dahlia | date = July 26, 2008 | title = The Fiction Behind Torture Policy | work = [[Newsweek]] | url = http://www.newsweek.com/id/149009 | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Chertoff]], the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] under the [[George W. Bush administration]], declared that ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' "reflects real life", [[John Yoo]], the former [[U.S. Justice Department|Justice Department]] lawyer who produced the [[torture memos]] cited Bauer in support while [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Antonin Scalia]] went further, "Jack Bauer saved [[Los Angeles]]... He saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Are you going to convict Jack Bauer?".&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt; One of the shows' creators stated:

{{quote|Most terrorism experts will tell you that the ‘ticking time bomb’ situation never occurs in real life, or very rarely. But on our show it happens every week.&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt;}}

The show uses the same [[enhanced interrogation|techniques]] that are used by the U.S. against terrorist suspects during the [[War on Terror]]. [[U.S. Army]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Patrick Finnegan, the dean of the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]], and others, objected to the central theme of the show—that the letter of American law must be sacrificed for the country’s security—as it had an adverse effect on the training of actual American soldiers by advocating unethical and illegal behavior. As Finnegan said:

{{quote|The kids see it, and say, 'If torture is wrong, what about "24"?'}}

He continued,

{{quote|The disturbing thing is that although torture may cause [[Jack Bauer]] some angst, it is always the patriotic thing to do.&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt;}}

The "ticking time bomb scenario" is subject of the drama ''The Dershowitz Protocol'' by Canadian author Robert Fothergill. In that play, the American government has established a protocol of "intensified interrogation" for terrorist suspects which requires participation of the [[FBI]], [[CIA]] and the Department of Justice. The drama deals with the psychological pressure and the tense triangle of competences under the overriding importance that each participant has to negotiate the actions with his conscience.

In [[Electronics|electronic]] [[instrumentation]] and [[signal processing]], a '''time to digital converter''' (abbreviated '''TDC''') is a device for recognizing events and providing a digital representation of the [[time]] they occurred. For example, a TDC might output the time of arrival for each incoming pulse. Some applications wish to measure the time interval between two events rather than some notion of an absolute time.

In [[electronics]] '''time-to-digital converters''' (TDCs) or '''time digitizers''' are devices commonly used to measure a time interval and convert it into digital (binary) output. In some cases &lt;ref name=Kalisz&gt;{{Citation |title=Review of methods for time interval measurements with picosecond resolution |first=Józef |last=Kalisz |journal=Metrologia |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages= 17–32 |date=February 2004 |publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing |doi=10.1088/0026-1394/41/1/004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Interpolation|interpolating]] TDCs are also called '''time counters''' (TCs).

TDCs are used in many different applications, where the time interval between two signal pulses (start and stop pulse) should be determined. Measurement is started and stopped, when either the rising or the falling edge of a signal pulse crosses a set threshold. These requirements are fulfilled in many physical experiments, like [[time-of-flight]] and lifetime measurements in [[atomic physics|atomic]] and [[particle physics|high energy physics]], experiments that involve [[laser rangefinder|laser ranging]] and electronic research involving the testing of [[integrated circuits]] and high-speed data transfer.&lt;ref name=Kalisz /&gt;

==Application==
TDCs are used in applications where measurement events happen infrequently, such as [[high energy physics]] [[experiment]]s, where the sheer number of data [[channel (communications)|channels]] in most detectors ensures that each channel will be excited only infrequently by particles such as electrons, photons, and ions.

==Coarse measurement==
[[File:CMOS TW OSC 000.png|thumb|right|A CMOS (rotary) traveling wave [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] or [[Digital delay line|delay line]] or [[distributed amplifier]] runs at a flip-flop compatible frequency, but has sharper edges and sub-edge resolution]]

If the required time resolution is not high, then counters can be used to make the conversion.

===Basic counter===
&lt;!-- this is a straight time measurement; capture count; no start signal --&gt;

In its simplest implementation, a TDC is simply a high-[[frequency]] [[Counter (digital)|counter]] that increments every clock cycle. The current contents of the counter represents the current time. When an event occurs, the counter's value is captured in an output register.

In that approach, the measurement is an integer number of clock cycles, so the measurement is quantized to a clock period. To get finer resolution, a faster clock is needed. The accuracy of the measurement depends upon the stability of the clock frequency.

Typically a TDC uses a [[crystal oscillator]] reference frequency for good long term stability. High stability crystal oscillators are usually relative low frequency such as 10&amp;nbsp;MHz (or 100&amp;nbsp;ns resolution).&lt;ref&gt;For example, a Hewlett-Packard (now Agilent) 10811 crystal oven oscillator; http://www.hparchive.com/Manuals/HP-10811AB-Manual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; To get better resolution, a [[phase-locked loop]] frequency multiplier can be used to generate a faster clock. One might, for example, multiply the crystal reference oscillator by 100 to get a clock rate of 1&amp;nbsp;GHz (1&amp;nbsp;ns resolution).

====Counter technology====
High clock rates impose additional design constraints on the counter: if the clock period is short, it is difficult to update the count. Binary counters, for example, need a fast carry architecture because they essentially add one to the previous counter value. A solution is using a hybrid counter architecture. A [[Ring counter|Johnson counter]], for example, is a fast non-binary counter. It can be used to count very quickly the low order count; a more conventional binary counter can be used to accumulate the high order count. The fast counter is sometime called a [[prescaler]].

The speed of counters fabricated in [[CMOS]]-technology is limited by the capacitance between the gate and the channel and by the resistance of the channel and the signal traces. The product of both is the cut-off-frequency. Modern chip technology allows multiple metal layers and therefore coils with a large number of windings to be inserted into the chip.
This allows designers to peak the device for a specific [[frequency]], which may lie above the cut-off-frequency of the original transistor.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

A peaked variant of the Johnson counter is the [[distributed amplifier|traveling-wave]] counter which also achieves sub-cycle resolution. Other methods to achieve sub-cycle resolution include [[analog-to-digital converter]]s and [[Vernier scale|vernier]] [[Counter (digital)|Johnson counters]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

====Measuring a time interval====
[[File:CoarseCounting.png|thumb|sketch of the coarse counting method in TDCs: showing measurements of T in various relations to the clock pulses]]

In most situations, the user does not want to just capture an arbitrary time that an event occurs, but wants to measure a time interval, the time between a start event and a stop event.

That can be done by measuring an arbitrary time both the start and stop events and subtracting. The measurement can be off by two counts.

The subtraction can be avoided if the counter is held at zero until the start event, counts during the interval, and then stops counting after the stop event.

'''Coarse counters''' base on a [[clock signal|reference clock]] with signals generated at a stable [[frequency]] &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Kalisz /&gt; When the start signal is detected the [[Counter (digital)|counter]] starts counting clock signals and terminates counting after the stop signal is detected. The time interval &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; between start and stop is then

:&lt;math&gt; T = n\cdot T_0 &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the number of counts and &lt;math&gt;T_0 = 1/f_0&lt;/math&gt;, the period of the [[clock signal|reference clock]].

===Statistical counter===
Since start, stop and [[clock signal]] are asynchronous, there is a uniform [[probability distribution]] of the start and stop signal-times between two subsequent clock pulses. This detuning of the start and stop signal from the clock pulses is called [[quantization error]].

For a series of measurements on the same constant and asynchronous time interval one measures two different numbers of counted clock pulses &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; (see picture). These occur with [[probabilities]]

:&lt;math&gt; p(n_1) = 1 - c&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q(n_2) = c&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;c = Frc(T/T_0)&lt;/math&gt; the [[fractional part]] of &lt;math&gt;T/T_0&lt;/math&gt;. The value for the time interval is then obtained by

:&lt;math&gt;T = (p\cdot n_1 + q\cdot n_2)\cdot T_0&lt;/math&gt;

Measuring a time interval using a coarse counter with the averaging method described above is relatively time consuming because of the many repetitions that are needed to determine the probabilities &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. In comparison to the other methods described later on, a coarse counter has a very limited resolution (1ns in case of a 1&amp;nbsp;GHz [[clock signal|reference clock]]), but satisfies with its theoretically unlimited measuring range.

==Fine measurement==

In contrast to the coarse counter in the previous section, fine measurement methods with much better accuracy but far smaller measuring range are presented here.&lt;ref name=Kalisz /&gt; [[analog signal|Analogue]] methods like time interval stretching or double conversion as well as [[Digital data|digital]] methods like tapped delay lines and the Vernier method are under examination. Though the [[analog signal|analogue]] methods still obtain better accuracies, [[Digital data|digital]] time interval measurement is often preferred due to its flexibility in [[integrated circuit]] technology and its robustness against external perturbations like temperature changes.

The counter implementation's accuracy is limited by the clock frequency. If time is measured by whole counts, then the resolution is limited to the clock period. For example, a 10&amp;nbsp;MHz clock has a resolution of 100&amp;nbsp;ns. To get resolution finer than a clock period, there are time interpolation circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Time and Frequency from A to Z |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |year= |url=http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-ti.htm |quote=For example, multiplying the time base frequency to 100&amp;nbsp;MHz makes 10&amp;nbsp;ns resolution possible, and 1&amp;nbsp;ns counters have even been built using a 1&amp;nbsp;GHz time base. However, a more common way to increase resolution is to detect parts of a time base cycle through interpolation and not be limited by the number of whole cycles. Interpolation has made 1&amp;nbsp;ns TICs commonplace, and even 20&amp;nbsp;picosecond TICs are available. |doi= }}, entry for ''time interval counter''.&lt;/ref&gt; These circuits measure the fraction of a clock period: that is, the time between a clock event and the event being measured. The interpolation circuits often require a significant amount of time to perform their function; consequently, the TDC needs a quiet interval before the next measurement.

===Ramp interpolator===

When counting is not feasible because the clock rate would be too high, analog methods can be used. Analog methods are often used to measure intervals that are between 10 and 200&amp;nbsp;ns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kalisz|2004|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods often use a capacitor that is charged during the interval being measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Reeser |first=Gilbert A. |title=An Electronic Counter for the 1970's |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal |date=May 1969 |volume=20 |issue=9 |pages=9&amp;ndash;12 |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1969-05.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sasaki"&gt;{{Citation |first=Gary D. |last=Sasaki |first2=Ronald C. |last2=Jensen |title=Automatic Measurements with a High Performance Universal Counter |date=September 1980 |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1980-09.pdf |journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=21&amp;ndash;31 |issn= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Rush |first=Kenneth |last2=Oldfield |first2=Danny J. |title=A Data Acquisition System for a 1-GHz Digitizing Oscilloscope |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal |date=April 1986 |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=4&amp;ndash;11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HP1"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Eskeldson |first=David D. |last2=Kellum |first2=Reginald |last3=Whiteman |first3=Donald A. |title=A Digitizing Oscilloscope Time Base and Trigger System Optimized for Throughput and Low Jitter |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal |date=October 1993 |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=21&amp;ndash;30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the capacitor is discharged to zero volts. When the start event occurs, the capacitor is charged with a constant current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; the constant current causes the voltage ''v'' on the capacitor to increase linearly with time. The rising voltage is called the fast ramp. When the stop event occurs, the charging current is stopped. The voltage on the capacitor ''v'' is directly proportional to the time interval ''T'' and can be measured with an [[analog-to-digital converter]] (ADC). The resolution of such a system is in the range of 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;ps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kalisz|2004|p=20}}. Kalisz states that the [[Stanford Research Systems]] SR620 uses this method.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a separate ADC can be used, the ADC step is often integrated into the interpolator. A second constant current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used to discharge the capacitor at a constant but much slower rate (the slow ramp). The slow ramp might be 1/1000 of the fast ramp. This discharge effectively "stretches" the time interval;&lt;ref name="Esk p27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eskeldson|Kellum|Whiteman|1993|p=27}} stating, "Effectively, the interpolator magnifies the interpolation or uncertainty interval by the ratio of the charge and discharge currents."&lt;/ref&gt; it will take 1000 times as long for the capacitor to discharge to zero volts. The stretched interval can be measured with a counter. The measurement is similar to a [[Integrating ADC|dual-slope analog converter]].

The dual-slope conversion can take a long time: a thousand or so clock ticks in the scheme described above. That limits how often a measurement can be made (dead time). Resolution of 1&amp;nbsp;ps with a 100&amp;nbsp;MHz (10&amp;nbsp;ns) clock requires a stretch ratio of 10,000 and implies a conversion time of 150&amp;nbsp;&amp;mu;s.&lt;ref name="Esk p27"/&gt; To decrease the conversion time, the interpolator circuit can be used twice in a '''residual interpolator technique'''.&lt;ref name="Esk p27"/&gt; The fast ramp is used initially as above to determine the time. The slow ramp is only at 1/100. The slow ramp will cross zero at some time during the clock period. When the ramp crosses zero, the fast ramp is turned on again to measure the crossing time (''t''&lt;sub&gt;residual&lt;/sub&gt;). Consequently, the time can be determined to 1 part in 10,000.

Interpolators are often used with a stable system clock. The start event is asynchronous, but the stop event is a following clock.&lt;ref name="Sasaki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP1"/&gt;  For convenience, imagine that the fast ramp rises exactly 1&amp;nbsp;volt during a 100 ns clock period. Assume the start event occurs at 67.3&amp;nbsp;ns after a clock pulse; the fast ramp integrator is triggered and starts rising. The asynchronous start event is also routed through a synchronizer that takes at least two clock pulses. By the next clock pulse, the ramp has risen to .327&amp;nbsp;V. By the second clock pulse, the ramp has risen to 1.327&amp;nbsp;V and the synchronizer reports the start event has been seen. The fast ramp is stopped and the slow ramp starts. The synchronizer output can be used to capture system time from a counter. After 1327 clocks, the slow ramp returns to its starting point, and interpolator knows that the event occurred 132.7&amp;nbsp;ns before the synchronizer reported.

The interpolator is actually more involved because there are synchronizer issues and current switching is not instantaneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eskeldson|Kellum|Whiteman|1993|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the interpolator must calibrate the height of the ramp to a clock period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sasaki|Jensen|1980|p=23}} stating, "In practice, the current sources and other circuitry used to build the interpolators are subject to operational variations over temperature and time. The 5360A's interpolators were in a special insulated cavity and had several adjustments. The 5335A uses a self-calibration technique that is not affected by temperature and needs no adjustments."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vernier===
&lt;!-- these need to be merged --&gt;

====Vernier interpolator====
The vernier method is more involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Chu |first1=David C. |last2=Allen |first2=Mark S. |last3=Foster |first3=Allen S. |title=Universal Counter Resolves Picoseconds in Time Interval Measurements |date=August 1978 |journal=HP Journal |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=2&amp;ndash;11 |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1978-08.pdf |issn= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The method involves a triggerable oscillator&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Chu |first1=David C. |title=The Triggered Phase-Locked Oscillator |date=August 1978 |journal=HP Journal |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=8&amp;ndash;9 |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1978-08.pdf |issn= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a coincidence circuit. At the event, the integer clock count is stored and the oscillator is started. The triggered oscillator has a slightly different frequency than the clock oscillator. For sake of argument, say the triggered oscillator has a period that is 1&amp;nbsp;ns faster than the clock. If the event happened 67&amp;nbsp;ns after the last clock, then the triggered oscillator transition will slide by &amp;minus;1&amp;nbsp;ns after each subsequent clock pulse. The triggered oscillator will be at 66&amp;nbsp;ns after the next clock, at 65&amp;nbsp;ns after the second clock, and so forth. A coincidence detector looks for when the triggered oscillator and the clock transition at the same time, and that indicates the fraction time that needs to be added.

The interpolator design is more involved. The triggerable clock must be calibrated to clock. It must also start quickly and cleanly.

====Vernier method====
&lt;!-- this uses two startable oscillators; most implementations will use a stable clock and a startable oscillator --&gt;

The '''Vernier method''' is a [[Digital data|digital]] version of the time stretching method. Two only slightly detuned [[oscillation|oscillators]] (with [[frequencies]] &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt;) start their signals with the arrival of the start and the stop signal. As soon as the leading edges of the [[oscillation|oscillator]] signals coincide the measurement ends and the number of periods of the oscillators (&lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively) lead to the original time interval &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{n_1-1}{f_1} - \frac{n_2-1}{f_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Since highly reliable [[oscillation|oscillators]] with stable and accurate [[frequency]] are still quite a challenge one also realizes the vernier method via two tapped delay lines using two slightly different cell delay times &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. This setting is called '''differential delay line''' or '''vernier delay line'''.

In the example presented here the first delay line affiliated with the start signal contains cells of D-[[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s with delay &lt;math&gt;\tau_L&lt;/math&gt; which are initially set to transparent. During the transition of the start signal through one of those cells, the signal is delayed by &lt;math&gt;\tau_L&lt;/math&gt; and the state of the flip-flop is sampled as transparent. The second delay line belonging to the stop signal is composed of a series of [[operational amplifier#Applications|non-inverting buffers]] with delay &lt;math&gt;\tau_B &lt; \tau_L&lt;/math&gt;. Propagating through its channel the stop signal latches the flip-flops of the start signal's delay line. As soon as the stop signal passes the start signal, the latter is stopped and all leftover flip-flops are sampled opaque. Analogous to the above case of the oscillators the wanted time interval &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is then

:&lt;math&gt;T = n\cdot (\tau_1 - \tau_2)&lt;/math&gt;

with n the number of cells marked as transparent.

===Tapped delay line===
[[File:TapDelayLine.png|thumb|circuit diagram of a tapped delay line]]

In general a '''tapped delay line''' contains a number of cells with well defined delay times &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Propagating through this line the start signal is delayed. The state of the line is sampled at the time of the arrival of the stop signal.
This can be realized for example with a line of D-flip-flop cells with a delay time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. The start signal propagates through this line of transparent [[flip-flops]] and is delayed by a certain number of them. The output of each flip-flop is sampled on the fly. The stop signal latches all [[flip-flops]] while propagating through its channel undelayed and the start signal cannot propagate further. Now the time interval between start and stop signal is proportional to the number of [[flip-flops]] that were sampled as transparent.

==Hybrid measurement==
[[File:Nutt.png|thumb|Sketch of the Nutt interpolation method]]
&lt;!-- terminology clash: interpolation (used above) and interpolator = synchronizer and fine method --&gt;

Counters can measure long intervals but have limited resolution. Interpolators have high resolution but they cannot measure long intervals. A hybrid approach can achieve both long intervals and high resolution.&lt;ref name=Kalisz /&gt;  The long interval can be measured with a counter. The counter information is supplemented with two time interpolators: one interpolator measures the (short) interval between the start event and a following clock event, and the second interpolator measure the interval between the stop event and a following clock event. The basic idea has some complications: the start and stop events are asynchronous, and one or both might happen close to a clock pulse. The counter and interpolators must agree on matching the start and end clock events. To accomplish that goal, synchronizers are used.

The common hybrid approach is the '''Nutt method'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kalisz |first=J. |last2=Pawlowski |first2=M. |last3=Pelka |first3=R. |year=1987 |title=Error analysis and design of the Nutt time-interval digitiser with picosecond resolution |publisher= |journal=J. Phys. E: Sci. Instrum. |volume=20 |issue= |pages=1330&amp;ndash;1341 |issn= |doi= 10.1088/0022-3735/20/11/005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example the fine measurement circuit measures the time between start and stop pulse and the respective second nearest clock pulse of the coarse counter (''T''&lt;sub&gt;start&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;stop&lt;/sub&gt;), detected by the synchronizer (see figure). Thus the wanted time interval is

:&lt;math&gt;T = n T_0 + T_{\mathrm{start}} - T_{\mathrm{stop}}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''n'' the number of counter clock pulses and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the period of the coarse counter.

==History==

Time measurement has played a crucial role in the understanding of nature from the earliest times. Starting with sun, sand or water driven [[clocks]] we are able to use clocks today, based on the most precise [[caesium]] resonators.

The first direct predecessor of a TDC was invented in the year 1942 by [[Bruno Rossi]] for the measurement of [[muon]] lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;"Bruno Benedetto Rossi", George W. Clark, National Academic Press, Washington D.C. 1998, S.13&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed as a '''time-to-amplitude-converter''', constantly charging a [[capacitor]] during the measured time interval. The corresponding [[voltage]] is directly proportional to the time interval under examination.

While the basic concepts (like Vernier methods ([[Pierre Vernier]] 1584-1638) and time stretching) of dividing time into measurable intervals are still up-to-date, the implementation changed a lot during the past 50 years. Starting with [[vacuum tubes]] and [[transformer types#RF transformers|ferrite pot-core transformers]] those ideas are implemented in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor ([[CMOS]]) design today.&lt;ref&gt;"Noise Shaping Techniques for Analog and Time to Digital Converters Using Voltage Controlled Oscillators", Matthew A.Z. Straayer, Phd-Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Errors==
:&lt;small&gt;Some information from &lt;ref name=Kalisz /&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
Regarding even the fine measuring methods presented, there are still errors one may wish remove or at least to consider. Non-linearities of the time-to-digital conversion for example can be identified by taking a large number of measurements of a [[poissonian]] distributed source (statistical code density test).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Pelka |first=R. |last2=Kalisz |first2=J. |last3=Szplet |first3=R. |year=1997 |title=Nonlinearity correction of the integrated time-to-digital converter with direct coding |journal=IEEE Trans. Instrumentation and Measurement |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=449–452 |doi=10.1109/19.571882}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small deviations from the uniform distribution reveal the non-linearities.
Inconveniently the statistical code density method is quite sensitive to external temperature changes. Thus stabilizing [[delay-locked loop|delay]] or [[phase-locked loop]] (DLL or PLL) circuits are recommended.

In a similar way, offset errors (non-zero readouts at ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) can be removed.

For long time intervals, the error due to instabilities in the [[clock signal|reference clock]] ([[jitter]]) plays a major role. Thus clocks of superior quality are needed for such TDCs.

Furthermore, external noise sources can be eliminated in postprocessing by [[robust statistic|robust estimation methods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kalisz |first=J. |last2=Pawlowski |first2=M. |last3=Pelka |first3=R. |date=March 1994 |title=Precision time counter for laser ranging to satellites |journal=Rev. Sci. Instrum. |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=736–741 |doi=10.1063/1.1145094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Configurations==

TDCs are currently built as stand-alone measuring devices in physical experiments or as system components like PCI cards. They can be made up of either discrete or integrated circuits.

Circuit design changes with the purpose of the TDC, which can either be a very good solution for single-shot TDCs with long dead times or some trade-off between dead-time and resolution for multi-shot TDCs.

==Delay generator==
[[File:TDC DTC 000.png|thumb|right|Similarity between a '''TDC''' (bottom) and a '''Delay Generator''' (top, but needs bottom for trigger). The strobe is gated by the oscillator to avoid a race with the carry bit]]
{{main|Digital delay generator}}

The time-to-digital converter measures the time between a start event and a stop event. There is also a '''digital-to-time converter''' or '''delay generator'''. The delay generator converts a number to a time delay. When the delay generator gets a start pulse at its input, then it outputs a stop pulse after the specified delay. The architectures for TDC and delay generators are similar. Both use counters for long, stable, delays. Both must consider the problem of clock quantization errors.

For example, the [[Tektronix]] 7D11 Digital Delay uses a counter architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Tektronix 7D11 Digital Delay Service Instruction Manual |publisher=Tektronix |location=Beaverton, OR |id=070-1377-01 |year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; A digital delay may be set from 100&amp;nbsp;ns to 1&amp;nbsp;s in 100&amp;nbsp;ns increments. An analog circuit provides an additional fine delay of 0 to 100&amp;nbsp;ns. A 5&amp;nbsp;MHz reference clock drives a [[phase-locked loop]] to produce a stable 500&amp;nbsp;MHz clock. It is this fast clock that is gated by the (fine-delayed) start event and determines the main quantization error. The fast clock is divided down to 10&amp;nbsp;MHz and fed to main counter.&lt;ref&gt;Ten megahertz is a frequency that TTL logic in 1971 could handle. The high frequency divisions were handled with different technologies because high speed digital counters were uncommon in 1971. The first (500&amp;nbsp;MHz) divider stage is a 100&amp;nbsp;MHz synchronized [[multivibrator]] to effect a divide by 5 circuit. The second (100&amp;nbsp;MHz) stage is a divide by 5 ring counter made from discrete emitter-coupled transistors. The last stage is a flip-flop.&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument quantization error depends primarily on the 500&amp;nbsp;MHz clock (2&amp;nbsp;ns steps), but other errors also enter; the instrument is specified to have 2.2&amp;nbsp;ns of [[jitter]]. The recycle time is 575&amp;nbsp;ns.

Just as a TDC may use interpolation to get finer than one clock period resolution, a delay generator may use similar techniques. The [[Hewlett-Packard]] 5359A High Resolution Time Synthesizer provides delays of 0 to 160&amp;nbsp;ms, has an accuracy of 1&amp;nbsp;ns, and achieves a typical jitter of 100&amp;nbsp;ps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Time Synthesizer Generates Precise Pulse Widths and Time Delays for Critical Timing Applications |first1=Keith M. |last1=Ferguson |first2=Leonard R. |last2=Dickstein |journal=HP Journal |volume=29 |issue=12 |date=August 1978 |pages=12–19 |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1978-08.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design uses a triggered phase-locked oscillator that runs at 200&amp;nbsp;MHz. Interpolation is done with a ramp, an 8-bit digital-to-analog converter, and a comparator. The resolution is about 45&amp;nbsp;ps.

&lt;!-- stuff from earlier version --&gt;
When the start pulse is received, then [[Counter (digital)|count]]s down and outputs a stop pulse. For low [[jitter]] the [[Counter (digital)|synchronous counter]] has to feed a [[Status register|zero flag]] from the [[most significant bit]] down to the [[least significant bit]] and then combine it with the output from the Johnson counter.

A [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC) could be used to achieve sub-cycle resolution, but it is easier to either use vernier Johnson counters or traveling-wave Johnson counters.

The delay generator can be used for [[pulse width modulation]], e.g. to drive a [[MOSFET]] to load a [[Pockels cell]] within 8 ns with a specific charge.

The output of a delay generator can gate a digital-to-analog converter and so pulses of a variable height can be generated. This allows matching to low levels needed by analog electronics, higher levels for [[Emitter-coupled logic|ECL]] and even higher levels for [[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]]. If a series of DACs is gated in sequence, variable pulse shapes can be generated to account for any transfer function.

'''Vyapti''', a [[Sanskrit]] expression, in [[Hindu philosophy]] refers to the state of pervasion. It is considered as the logical ground of [[inference]] which is one of the means to [[knowledge]]. No [[Logical consequence|conclusion]] can be inferred without the knowledge of vyapti. Vyapti guarantees the truth of conclusion. It signifies the relation of invariable concomitance between "''hetu''" and "''sadhya''" and is of two kinds. Vyapti between terms of unequal extension is called "''asamavyavyapti''" or "''visamavyapti''", and vyapti between equal extensions is called "''samavyapti''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Companion Encyclopaedia of Hindu philosophy|author= Subodh kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZWdEymxyp4C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=vyapti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=akw9UbCIDoT_rAecs4GABw&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=vyapti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vyapti is a universal statement that expresses the "''niyata sahacharya''" or relation of constant concomitance between ''hetu'' or the middle term and ''sadhya'' or the major term and implies the "''sahacara''" i.e. the knowledge of invariable relation of causality or co-existence between ''sadhya'' and ''hetu'' in all the three instances of time, which is possible when the "''anupadhik sambandha''" i.e. relation of unconditionality between the two is known. It is defined as the unconditional and constant concomitant relation between "''vyapya''", the pervaded, and "''vyapaka''", the pervader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Essay:Vyapti is considered as the ground of inferences|url=http://www.preservearticles.com/2011091413427/essay-vyapti-is-considered-as-the-ground-of-inferences.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Charvaka]] school of Hindu philosophy while admitting the existence of the world and denying pre-existence rejects inference and testimony; they recognize perception as the only means to knowledge. They hold the view that the universal concomitance of the middle term with the major term can never be known since their agreement in presence and agreement in absence can never be known as also their invariable concomitance because there are no class-characters and universals. Vyapti can never be known because it does not exist. If inductive inference is proved by vyapti then these two cannot be mutually dependent.

The [[Nyaya]] school of [[Aksapada Gautama|Gautama]] speaks of five-membered inference or "''pararthanumana''". Knowledge of vyapti is considered by this school to be the cause of successful inference because inference depends upon the unconditional universal concomitance between the middle term and the major term, the middle term indicating the existence of the major term, and is to be found in the minor term or "''paksa''", the subject of inference. It is not possible to perceive all instances of the middle term and the major term nor can vyapti be known by internal perception. In order for the inference to be sound the major and the minor premises have to be true, the former should be secure because the latter’s truth is given by perception. They hold the view that vyapti is the unconditional uniform relation of the [[reason]] to the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] and that a condition pervades the predicate. Faulty reasons such as inconclusive ("''savyabhicara''"), contradictory ("''viruddha''"), counterbalanced ("''prakaranasama''"), unproved ("''sadhyasama''"), and mistimed ("''atitkala''") or contradicted ("''badhita''') hinder the production of a valid inference when they are known. Vyapti is known by the joint method of agreement in presence and agreement in absence based on repeated observation aided by favourable hypothetical reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Indian Philosophy|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Pilgrims Book (P) Ltd.|page=64,220|url=http://www.pilgrimsbookhouse.com/xauthordetailsnew.php?mauthor=Jadunath%20Sinha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doubt about vyapti and certainty of the absence of vyapti act as hindrances to inferential knowledge; the certainty about vyapti is the cause of inferential knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gangesa’s Theory of Truth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9d-ve7e2Vi0C&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=vyapti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=akw9UbCIDoT_rAecs4GABw&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=vyapti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Jain philosophy]] recognizes inference ("''anumana''") as a valid means of knowledge. They consider induction ("''tarka''") to be the knowledge of the invariable concomitance (vyapti) of the middle term with the major term in the three periods of time, arising from the observation of their co-presence and co-absence, and vyapti to be of two kinds, "''anvayavyapti''" and "''vyatirekavyapti''". Wherever there is smoke, there is fire; this is ''anvayavyapti''. Wherever there is no fire, there is no smoke; this is ''vyatirekavyapti''. They hold the view that inference is based on vyapti which is derived from [[Inductive reasoning|induction]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Indian Philosophy|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Pilgrims Book (P) Ltd.|page=125|url=http://www.pilgrimsbookhouse.com/xauthordetailsnew.php?mauthor=Jadunath%20Sinha}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Systems of Indian Philosophy|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FWLRyXBzgsoC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=vyapti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2LY9UeWsOon8rAf4m4H4Bw&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=vyapti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The followers of the [[Advaita Vedanta]] do not regard the knowledge of the existence of the probans, pervaded by the probandum, in the subject of inference as the cause of inference or the instrumental cause of inference. Vyapti is the co-existence of the probans and the probandum in all the strata of the probans and does not depend upon the agreement in absence between the probans and the probandum. Inference is "''[[Anvaya (Indian logic)|anvayi]]''" and depends upon the agreement in presence between the probans and the probandum and is founded on their positive concomitance. They reject ''anvaya-vyatireki'' inference recognized by the Navya Nayaya. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Indian Philosophy|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Pilgrims Book (P) Ltd.|page=370|url=http://www.pilgrimsbookhouse.com/xauthordetailsnew.php?mauthor=Jadunath%20Sinha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though most schools of Indian thought have proposed their own method of ascertaining vyapti, because they base the knowledge of universal propositions on the principle of causality and essential identity in order to know how cause and effect are universally related, the [[Buddhists]] adopt the method of "''pancakarani''". To the Vedantins vyapti is the result of an induction by simple enumeration. The Naiyayikas firstly look for the relation of agreement in presence between two things, and thereafter look for the uniform agreement in absence between them, then they look for contrary instances and finally eliminate all [[upadhi]] or conditions. They supplement the uncontradicted experience of the relation between two facts by ''tarka'' or indirect proof and by "''samanylakshana''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Companion Encyclopaedia of Hindu philosophy|author= Subodh kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZWdEymxyp4C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=vyapti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=akw9UbCIDoT_rAecs4GABw&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=vyapti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the "''Ashta Siddhis''" that already exist in nature, the followers of [[Aurobindo]] agree that consciousness in itself is free to communicate between one mind and another without physical means consciously and voluntarily, and it does so through two siddhis, namely, "''Vyapti''" and "''Prakamya''". ''Vyapti'' is when feelings of others from outside are felt, and also when one sends own thoughts to others. ''Prakamya'' is when one looks mentally or physically  at something and perceives what is in that thing or super-perceives via the senses &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Aurobindo and the Mother|author=Kireet Joshi|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=249|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wW-_IiNSARgC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=vyapti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Nr89Uaa2L8rVrQfD8IBg&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=vyapti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''water–cement ratio''' is the ratio of the weight of water to the weight of [[cement]] used in a [[concrete]] mix. A lower ratio leads to higher strength and durability, but may make the mix difficult to work with and form. Workability can be resolved with the use of [[plasticizer]]s or [[superplasticizer|super-plasticizers]].

Often, the ratio refers to the ratio of water to cement plus [[pozzolan]] ratio, w/(c+p). The pozzolan is typically a [[fly ash]], or [[blast furnace]] [[slag]]. It can include a number of other materials, such as silica fume, rice husk ash or natural pozzolans. Pozzolans can be added to strengthen concrete.

The notion of water–cement ratio was first developed by [[Duff Abrams|Duff A. Abrams]] and published in 1918. Refer to [[concrete slump test]].
The 1997 [[Uniform Building Code]] specifies a maximum of 0.5 ratio when concrete is exposed to freezing and thawing in a moist condition or to de-icing chemicals, and a maximum of 0.45 ratio for concrete in a severe or very severe sulfate condition.

Concrete hardens as a result of the chemical reaction between cement and water (known as [[hydration reaction|hydration]], this produces heat and is called the heat of hydration). For every pound (or kilogram or any unit of weight) of cement, about 0.35 pounds (or 0.35&amp;nbsp;kg or corresponding unit) of water is needed to fully complete hydration reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Civil Engineering Materials|last=Somayaji|first=Shan|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2001|isbn=0-13-083906-X|location=Upper Saddle River|pages=129|quote=The water-to-cement ratio is the ratio between the weights of water and cement in a concrete mix. For proper hydration, this ratio (commonly called the w/c ratio) should be about 0.30, assuming no contribution to hydration from external water sources.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a mix with a ratio of 0.35 may not mix thoroughly, and may not flow well enough to be placed. More water is therefore used than is technically necessary to react with cement. Water–cement ratios of 0.45 to 0.60 are more typically used. For higher-strength concrete, lower ratios are used, along with a plasticizer to increase flowability.

Too much water will result in [[Segregation in concrete|segregation of the sand and aggregate components from the cement paste]]. Also, water that is not consumed by the hydration reaction may leave concrete as it hardens, resulting in microscopic pores (bleeding) that will reduce final strength of concrete. A mix with too much water will experience more shrinkage as excess water leaves, resulting in internal cracks and visible fractures (particularly around inside corners), which again will reduce the final strength.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13440">[[File:Mustela frenata.jpg|thumb|right|The software's name takes itself from dialogue in ''Hamlet'':&lt;br&gt;''Hamlet:'' Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?&lt;br&gt;''Polonius:'' By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.&lt;br&gt;''Hamlet:'' Methinks it is like a [[weasel]].]]

The '''weasel program''' or '''Dawkins' weasel''' is a [[thought experiment]] and a variety of [[computer simulation]]s illustrating it.  Their aim is to demonstrate that the process that drives [[evolution]]ary systems—random [[Mutation|variation]] combined with non-random cumulative [[Selection (biology)|selection]]—is different from pure [[chance (philosophy)|chance]].

The thought experiment was formulated by [[Richard Dawkins]], and the first simulation written by him; various other implementations of the program have been written by others.

== Overview ==
In chapter 3 of his book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', Dawkins gave the following introduction to the program, referencing the well-known [[infinite monkey theorem]]:

{{quote|I don't know who it was first pointed out that, given enough time, a [[monkey]] bashing away at [[Randomness|random]] on a [[typewriter]] could produce all the works of [[Shakespeare]]. The operative phrase is, of course, given enough time. Let us limit the task facing our monkey somewhat. Suppose that he has to produce, not the complete works of Shakespeare but just the short sentence 'Methinks it is like a [[weasel]]', and we shall make it relatively easy by giving him a typewriter with a restricted keyboard, one with just the 26 (capital) letters, and a space bar. How long will he take to write this one little sentence?}}

The scenario is staged to produce a string of [[gibberish]] letters, assuming that the selection of each letter in a sequence of 28 characters will be random. The number of possible combinations in this random sequence is 27&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;, or about 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;, so the [[probability]] that the monkey will produce a given sequence is extremely low. Any particular sequence of 28 characters could be selected as a "target" phrase, all equally as improbable as Dawkins's chosen target, "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL".

A [[computer program]] could be written to carry out the actions of Dawkins's [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] monkey, continuously generating combinations of 26 letters and spaces at high speed. Even at the rate of millions of combinations per second, it is unlikely, even given the entire [[Age of the universe|lifetime of the universe]] to run, that the program would ever produce the phrase "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL".&lt;ref&gt;For a string of 28 characters, with 27 possible characters (A-Z plus space), any randomly generated string has the probability one in 27^28 of being correct; that is approximately one in 10^40. If a program generating 10 million strings per second had been running since the start of the universe (around 14 billion years, or 10^17 seconds), it would have only generated around 10^24 strings by now.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins intends this example to illustrate a common misunderstanding of [[evolution]]ary change, i.e. that [[DNA]] sequences or [[organic compound]]s such as [[proteins]] are the result of atoms randomly combining to form more complex structures. In these types of computations, any sequence of [[amino acids]] in a protein will be extraordinarily improbable (this is known as [[Hoyle's fallacy]]). Rather, evolution proceeds by [[hill climbing]], as in [[adaptive landscape]]s.

Dawkins then goes on to show that a process of ''cumulative'' selection can take far fewer steps to reach any given target. In Dawkins's words:

{{quote|We again use our computer monkey, but with a crucial difference in its program. It again begins by choosing a random sequence of 28 letters, just as before ... it duplicates it repeatedly, but with a certain chance of random [[error]] &amp;ndash; 'mutation' &amp;ndash; in the copying. The computer examines the [[mutant]] nonsense phrases, the 'progeny' of the original phrase, and chooses the one which,'' however slightly, ''most resembles the target phrase, METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL.}}

By repeating the procedure, a randomly generated sequence of 28 letters and spaces will be gradually changed each [[generation]]. The sequences progress through each generation:

:Generation&amp;nbsp;01:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;WDLTMNLT&amp;nbsp;DTJBKWIRZREZLMQCO&amp;nbsp;P&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Note: the 4th character of line 1 is missing in Dawkins' text; however line 2 suggests it was probably a T&lt;/ref&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;02:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;WDLTMNLT&amp;nbsp;DTJBSWIRZREZLMQCO&amp;nbsp;P&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;10:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;MDLDMNLS&amp;nbsp;ITJISWHRZREZ&amp;nbsp;MECS&amp;nbsp;P&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;20:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;MELDINLS&amp;nbsp;IT&amp;nbsp;ISWPRKE&amp;nbsp;Z&amp;nbsp;WECSEL&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;30:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;METHINGS&amp;nbsp;IT&amp;nbsp;ISWLIKE&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;WECSEL&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;40:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;METHINKS&amp;nbsp;IT&amp;nbsp;IS&amp;nbsp;LIKE&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;WEASEL&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;43:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;METHINKS&amp;nbsp;IT&amp;nbsp;IS&amp;nbsp;LIKE&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;WEASEL&lt;/tt&gt;

Dawkins continues:

{{quote|The exact time taken by the computer to reach the target doesn't matter. If you want to know, it completed the whole exercise for me, the first time, while I was out to lunch. It took about half an hour. (Computer enthusiasts may think this unduly slow. The reason is that the program was written in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], a sort of computer baby-talk. When I rewrote it in [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], it took 11 seconds.) Computers are a bit faster at this kind of thing than monkeys, but the difference really isn't significant. What matters is the difference between the time taken by'' cumulative ''selection, and the time which the same computer, working flat out at the same rate, would take to reach the target phrase if it were forced to use the other procedure of'' single-step selection: ''about a million million million million million years. This is more than a million million million times as long as the universe has so far existed.}}

==Implications for biology==
The program aims to demonstrate that the preservation of small changes in an evolving string of characters (or [[gene]]s) can produce meaningful combinations in a relatively short time as long as there is some mechanism to select cumulative changes, whether it is a person identifying which traits are desirable (in the case of artificial selection) or a criterion of survival ("fitness") imposed by the environment (in the case of natural selection). Reproducing systems tend to preserve traits across generations, because the offspring inherit a copy of the parent's traits. It is the differences between offspring, the variations in copying, which become the basis for selection, allowing phrases closer to the target to survive, and the remaining variants to "die."

Dawkins discusses the issue of the mechanism of selection with respect to his "biomorphs" program:

{{quote|The human eye has an active role to play in the story. It is the selecting agent. It surveys the litter of progeny and chooses one for breeding. ...Our model, in other words, is strictly a model of artificial selection, not natural selection. The criterion for 'success' is not the direct criterion of survival, as it is in true natural selection. In true natural selection, if a body has what it takes to survive, its genes automatically survive because they are inside it. So the genes that survive tend to be, automatically, those genes that confer on bodies the qualities that assist them to survive.}}

Regarding the example's applicability to biological evolution, he is careful to point out that it has its limitations:

{{quote|Although the monkey/Shakespeare model is useful for explaining the distinction between single-step selection and cumulative selection, it is misleading in important ways. One of these is that, in each generation of selective 'breeding', the mutant 'progeny' phrases were judged according to the criterion of resemblance to a'' distant ideal ''target, the phrase METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL. Life isn't like that. Evolution has no long-term goal. There is no long-distance target, no final perfection to serve as a criterion for selection, although human vanity cherishes the absurd notion that our species is the final goal of evolution. In real life, the criterion for selection is always short-term, either simple survival or, more generally, reproductive success.}}

[[File:Dawkins-Weasel.png|thumb | A full run of a weasel program, with 100 offspring per generation, and a 5% mutation chance per character copied. Only the "fittest" string of each generation is shown. Note that, in generation 8, the 25th character, which had been correct (&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;), becomes incorrect (&lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;). The program does not "lock" correct characters, rather it measures at each iteration the closeness of the complete string to the 'target' phrase.]]

==More complex models==
In ''The Blind Watchmaker,'' Dawkins goes on to provide a graphical model of [[gene selection]] involving  entities he calls biomorphs. These are [[Plane (mathematics)|two-dimensional]] sets of [[Line (mathematics)#Line segment|line segments]] which bear relationships to each other, drawn under the control of "genes" that determine the appearance of the biomorph. By selecting entities from sequential generations of biomorphs, an experimenter can guide the evolution of the figures toward given shapes, such as "airplane" or "octopus" biomorphs.

As a simulation, the biomorphs are not much closer to the actual genetic behavior of biological organisms. Like the Weasel program, their development is shaped by an external factor, in this case the decisions of the experimenter who chooses which of many possible shapes will go forward into the following generation. They do however serve to illustrate the concept of "genetic space," where each possible gene is treated as a [[dimension]], and the actual genomes of living organisms make up a tiny fraction of all possible gene combinations, most of which will not produce a viable organism. As Dawkins puts it, "however many ways there may be of being alive, it is certain that there are vastly more ways of being dead". 

In ''Climbing Mount Improbable'', Dawkins responded to the limitations of the Weasel program by describing programs, written by other parties, that modeled the evolution of the [[spider web]].  He suggested that these programs were more realistic models of the evolutionary process, since they had no predetermined goal other than coming up with a web that caught more flies through a "trial and error" process.  Spiderwebs were seen as good topics for evolutionary modeling because they were simple examples of biosystems that were easily visualized; the modeling programs successfully generated a range of spider webs similar to those found in nature.

== Example algorithm ==
{{or section|date=August 2016}}
Although Dawkins did not provide the source code for his program, a "Weasel" style algorithm could run as follows.

# Start with a random string of 28 characters.
# Make 100 copies of the string (''reproduce'').
# For each character in each of the 100 copies, with a probability of 5%, replace (''mutate'') the character with a new random character.
#  Compare each new string with the target string "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL", and give each a score (the number of letters in the string that are correct and in the correct position).
# If any of the new strings has a perfect score (28), halt. Otherwise, take the highest scoring string, and go to step 2.

For these purposes, a "character" is any uppercase letter, or a space. The number of copies per generation, and the chance of mutation per letter are not specified in Dawkins's book; 100 copies and a 5% mutation rate are examples. Correct letters are not "locked". Each correct letter may become incorrect in subsequent generations. The terms of the program and the existence of the target phrase do however mean that such 'negative mutations' will quickly be 'corrected'.

A '''zebu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|iː|b|(|j|)|uː|,_|ˈ|z|eː|b|uː}}; ''Bos primigenius indicus'' or ''Bos indicus'' or ''Bos taurus indicus''), sometimes known as '''indicine cattle''' or '''humped cattle''', is a species or subspecies of domestic [[cattle]] originating in [[South Asia]]. Zebu are characterised by a fatty hump on their shoulders, a large [[dewlap]], and sometimes drooping ears. They are well adapted to withstanding high temperatures, and are farmed throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] countries, both as pure zebu and as [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s with [[taurine cattle]], the other main type of domestic cattle. Zebu are used as [[draught animal|draught]] and [[riding animal]]s,  [[dairy cattle]], and  [[beef cattle]], as well as for byproducts such as [[Hide (skin)|hide]]s and [[Feces|dung]] for [[fuel]] and [[manure]]. Zebu, namely [[Miniature Zebu]], are kept as [[companion animal]]s. In 1999, researchers at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] successfully cloned a zebu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/437391.stm |title=Cloning gives second chance for bull |date=1999-09-03 |work=BBC News |publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy and name==
The scientific name of zebu cattle was originally ''Bos indicus'', but they are now more commonly classified within the [[species]] ''Bos taurus'' as ''B. t. indicus'', together with taurine cattle (''B. t. taurus'') and the [[Extinction|extinct]] ancestor of both of them, the [[aurochs]] (''B. t. primigenius'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mammal Species of the World: Information on taurus|url=http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/biology/resources/msw3/browse.asp?id=14200687|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taurine ("European") cattle are descended from the Eurasian aurochs, while zebu are descended from the [[Indian aurochs]]. "Zebu" may be either singular or plural, but "zebus" is also an acceptable plural form. The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name, ''cebu'' or ''cebú'', is also present in a few English works.

==Origin==
[[Image:Rampurva bull capital side.jpg|thumb|upright|An early representation of a zebu, on the [[Rampurva]] [[capital (architecture)|capital]] of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]], third century BC]]

Archaeological evidence including pictures on pottery and rocks suggests that the species were present in Egypt around 2000 BC and were thought to be imported from the near east or south. ''Bos indicus'' is believed to have first appeared in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] between 700 and 1500 and was introduced to the [[Horn of Africa]] around 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2743556|title = Rethinking the Role of Bos indicus in Sub-Sahara Africa|last = Marshall|first = Fiona|date = April 1989 |journal=[[Current Anthropology]] |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages= |doi = 10.1086/203737 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breeds and hybrids==
[[File:Hariana_02.JPG|thumbnail|[[Haryanvi cattle|Hariana]] breed of Zebu cattle in north [[India]]]]
Some 75 breeds of zebu are known, split about evenly between African breeds and Indian ones. The major zebu cattle breeds of the world include [[Gyr cattle|Gyr]], [[Kankrej cattle and Guzerat cattle|Kankrej and Guzerat]], [[Indo-Brazilian cattle|Indo-Brazilian]], [[Brahman (cattle)|Brahman]],[[Cholistani (cattle)|Cholistani]], [[Nelore]], [[Ongole cattle|Ongole]], [[Sahiwal cattle|Sahiwal]], [[Red Sindhi cattle|Red Sindhi]], [[Butana and Kenana cattle|Butana and Kenana]], [[Boran cattle|Boran]], [[Baggara cattle|Baggara]], Tharparkar, [[Kangayam cattle|Kangayam]], [[Southern Yellow cattle|Southern Yellow]], Kedah-Kelantan, and Local Indian Dairy (LID). Kedah-Kelantan and LID originated from Malaysia. Other breeds of zebu are quite local, like the [[Haryanvi cattle|Hariana]] of [[Haryana]] and eastern [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]&lt;ref&gt;"Hariana — India: Haryana, eastern Punjab" page 245 ''In'' Porter, Valerie (1991) ''Cattle: A Handbook to the Breeds of the World'' Helm, London, {{ISBN|0-8160-2640-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Rath of [[Alwar district|Alwar]] in eastern [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref&gt;"Rath — India: Alwar and eastern Rajasthan" page 246 ''In'' Porter, Valerie (1991) ''Cattle: A Handbook to the Breeds of the World'' Helm, London, {{ISBN|0-8160-2640-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The African [[sanga cattle]] breeds originated from hybridization of zebu with indigenous African humpless cattle; they include the [[Afrikaner cattle|Afrikaner]], [[Red Fulani cattle|Red Fulani]], [[Ankole-Watusi]], and many other breeds of central and southern Africa.  Sanga cattle can be distinguished from pure zebu by having smaller humps located farther forward on the animals.

Zebu were imported to Africa over many hundreds of years, and interbred with [[taurine cattle]] there. Genetic analysis of African cattle has found higher concentrations of zebu genes all along the east coast of Africa, with especially pure cattle on the island of [[Madagascar]], either implying that the method of dispersal was cattle transported by ship or alternatively, the zebu may have reached East Africa via the coastal route (Pakistan, Iran, Southern Arabian coast) much earlier and crossed over to Madagascar. Partial resistance to [[rinderpest]] led to another increase in the frequency of zebu in Africa.

Zebu, which can tolerate extreme heat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/07/food-ark/cattle-breeds#/1 |title=Food Ark - Cattle Breeds - Pictures, More From National Geographic Magazine |publisher=Ngm.nationalgeographic.com |date=2013-04-25 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; were imported into [[Brazil]] in the early 20th century and crossbred with [[Charolais cattle]], a European taurine breed. The resulting breed, 63% Charolais and 37% zebu, is called the [[Canchim]]. It has a better meat quality than the zebu and better heat resistance than European cattle. The zebu breeds used were primarily Indo-Brazilian with some Nelore and Guzerat.

Many breeds are complex mixtures of the zebu and various taurine types, and some also have [[yak]], [[gaur]], or [[banteng]] genes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Zebu are very common in much of Asia, including China, India, Nepal, and almost all countries in Southeast Asia. In Asia, taurine cattle are only found in the northern regions such as [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Mongolia]], possibly domesticated separately from the other taurine cattle originating from Europe and Africa).  Other species of cattle domesticated in parts of Asia include yak, gaur, banteng, and [[water buffalo]].

[[Hanwoo]] is a traditional Korean taurine–zebu hybrid breed.

==Characteristics==
Zebu have humps on the shoulders, large dewlaps, and droopy ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?zebu|publisher=Online Medical Dictionary|accessdate=2007-09-08|title=Definition: Zebu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to taurine cattle, zebus are well adapted to the hot, dry environment of the tropics. Adaptations include resistance to drought and tolerance of intense heat and sunlight.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Review of a Reproductive Performance of Female Bos Indicus (zebu) Cattle|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mR7422SxIw4C|publisher = ILRI (aka ILCA and ILRAD)|date = 1989-01-01|isbn = 9789290530992|first = E.|last = Mukasa-Mugerwa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
Zebu are generally mature enough to begin reproducing around 44 months old. This is based on the development of their bodies to withstand the strain of carrying and lactation. Early reproduction can place too much stress on the body and possibly shorten lifespans. Carrying time of the calf averages at 285 days, but varies depending on the age and nutrition of the mother. The sex of the calf may also affect the carrying time, as male calves are carried for a shorter period than females. Location, breed, body weight, and season affect the overall health of the animal and in return may also affect the carrying period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = ILCA Monograph No. 6|last = Mukasa-Mugerwa|first = E.|publisher = ILCA|year = 1989|isbn = |location = Addis Ababa, Ethiopia|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:India.Mumbai.04.jpg|thumb|Draft zebu pulling a cart in [[Mumbai]], India]]
[[File:Female zebu cattle.JPG|thumbnail|Female zebu in Sri Lanka]]
Zebu are used as [[draught animal|draught]] and [[riding animal]]s, [[dairy cattle]], as well as for byproducts such as hides, [[Feces|dung]] for [[fuel]] and [[manure]], and bone for knife handles and the like. Zebu, mostly [[Miniature Zebu|miniature zebu]], are kept as [[pet]]s. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

''B. t. indicus'' cows commonly have low production of milk. They do not produce milk until maturation later in their lives and do not produce much, giving it solely to their calves. When ''B. t. indicus'' is crossed with ''B. t. taurus,'' production generally increases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Genetic analysis has shown that the αS1 gene is most likely to have originated in ''B. t. indicus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2052.2009.01861.x | volume=40 | issue=4 | title=Characterization and genetic analysis of bovine αs1-caseinIvariant | journal=Animal Genetics | pages=479–485 | last1 = Lühken | first1 = G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
