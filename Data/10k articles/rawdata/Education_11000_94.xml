'''1GOAL Education for All''' [[Advocacy group|campaign]] is run by the Education Week Foundation. Working with football and the footballing community, 1GOAL raises public awareness and involvement in achieving education for all the 67 million children out of school worldwide. It is supported by over 200 international footballers; over 70 football clubs including [[Manchester United]], [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]], [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], [[Chelsea FC]], [[FC Barcelona]], [[Inter Milan]], [[AC Milan]], [[Liverpool F.C.]], [[FC Porto]], [[Sporting Lisbon]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]; and national and international footballing organisations including the [[Confederation of African Football]], [[FIFPro]], the [[Professional Footballers' Association]] and [[FIFA]].

It was launched by [[Queen Rania]] of [[Jordan]] in August 2009. Alongside Queen Rania, it is co-chaired by [[FIFA]] President [[Sepp Blatter]] and [[Nobel prize]] [[laureate]] [[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeslive.co.za/opinion/columnists/article531580.ece/From-the-soccer-pitch-to-the-schoolroom From the soccer pitch to the schoolroom - Another View]; By [[Desmond Tutu]]; Jul 4, 2010; [[Times LIVE]].

Retrieved 2010-07-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

It campaigns to secure schooling for some 67 million children worldwide in accordance with the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Goal Promise]] of [[Education for All|education for all]] by 2015. There are several barriers to achieving universal primary education: lack of funds to pay for infrastructure and ongoing costs (buildings, teachers' salaries, learning materials); lack of qualified teachers; conflict and the practice of charging school fees in some developing countries.

As of July 2010, "Twelve million people have signed up to support 1Goal - that makes this the biggest campaign for education in history. [[Association football|Football]] is helping make something very special happen," says ambassador [[Anthony Baffoe]] of [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name="1Goal to educate millions"/&gt;

By September 2010, 18 million people had joined 1GOAL. During the UN Millennium Development Goals Review Summit, held in New York, 20–22 September 2010, [[Queen Rania]] delivered this petition directly to UN Secretary General, [[Ban Ki-moon]]. At a 1GOAL event during the same summit, the [[World Bank]] announced an increase of $750 million to education and the Australian Government announced an increase of about $5 billion, of which 70% is ringfenced for primary education.

Many world leaders, footballers and celebrities have supported the initiative including [[Shakira]], [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Pele]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Jessica Alba]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Patrick Vieira]], [[Michael Essien]], [[Samuel Eto'o]], [[Aaron Mokoena]], [[Quinton Fortune]], [[Rio Ferdinand]], [[Michael Ballack]], [[Bobby Charlton|Sir Bobby Charlton]] and [[Marcel Desailly]].&lt;ref name="1Goal to educate millions"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.oneindia.in/2010/06/28/join-to-score-1goal-in-world-cup.html Join to score 1GOAL in World Cup]; June 28, 2010; [[oneindia]].

{{Redirect|Eppur si muove}}
[[File:E pur si muove.jpg|thumb|Portrait, attributed to [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]], of Galileo Galilei gazing at the wall of his prison cell, on which are scratched the words "E pur si muove" (not legible in this image).]]

"'''And yet it moves'''" or '''"Albeit it does move"''' ({{lang-it|'''E pur si muove'''}} or '''''Eppur si muove''''' {{IPA-it|epˈpur si ˈmwɔːve|}}) is a phrase attributed to the Italian mathematician, physicist and philosopher [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642) in 1633 after being forced to recant his claims that the [[Earth]] moves around the immovable&lt;ref&gt;Sedley Taylor, 'Galileo and Papal Infallibility' (Dec 1873), in Macmillan's Magazine: November 1873 to April 1874 (1874) Vol 29, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sun]] rather than the converse during the [[Galileo affair]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Scientist'', April 7, 1983. p25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, the implication of the phrase is: despite his recantation, the Church's proclamations to the contrary, or any other conviction or doctrine of men, the Earth does, in fact, move (around the Sun, and not vice versa). As such, the phrase is used today as a sort of pithy retort implying that "it doesn't matter what you believe; these are the facts."

==Overview==
According to [[Stephen Hawking]], some historians believe this episode might have happened upon Galileo's transfer from house arrest under the watch of [[Ascanio II Piccolomini|Archbishop Ascanio Piccolomini]] to "another home, in the hills above Florence".&lt;ref name=Hawking03&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawking|first=Stephen|title=On the Shoulders of Giants: The Great Works of Physics and Astronomy|year=2003|publisher=[[Running Press]]|isbn=9780762416981|pages=396–7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pb6HR4DAEeMC&amp;pg=PA396}}&lt;/ref&gt; This other home was also his own, the ''[[Villa Il Gioiello]]'', in [[Arcetri]].&lt;ref&gt;

The earliest biography of Galileo, written by his disciple [[Vincenzo Viviani]] in 1655–1656, does not mention this phrase, and records of his trial do not cite it. Some authors say it would have been imprudent for Galileo to have said such a thing before the [[Roman Inquisition|Inquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Jay. [http://www.historyrundown.com/did-galileo-really-say-and-yet-it-moves/ "''Did Galileo Really Say: “And Yet It Moves”?''"], Retrieved on 1 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayton, Darin. [http://dhayton.haverford.edu/blog/2012/06/03/toward-a-history-of-eppur-si-muove/ "''Toward a history of “eppur si muove”''"], Retrieved on 28 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, the words "''E pur si muove''" were found on a Spanish painting which had just been acquired by an art collector, Jules van Belle, of [[Roeselare]], Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Memorials of Galileo (1564–1642)|
publisher = the Courier Press | location = Leamington and London| date = 1929 | first = J.J. | last = Fahie | pages = 72–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This painting was completed within a year or two of Galileo's death, as it is dated 1643 or 1645 (the last digit is partially obscured). The painting is not historically correct, because it depicts Galileo in a dungeon, but nonetheless shows that some variant of the "''Eppur si muove''" anecdote was in circulation immediately after his death, when many who had known him were still alive to attest to it, and that it had been circulating for over a century before it was published.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;

The event was first reported in English print in 1757 by [[Giuseppe Baretti]] in his book ''The Italian Library'':&lt;ref name=Drake&gt;{{cite book|last=Drake|first=Stillman|title=Galileo at Work: His Scientific Biography|year=2003|publisher=Dover Publications Inc.|location=Mineola (N.Y.)|isbn=0486495426|edition=Facsim.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OwOlRPbrZeQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|357}} {{quote|The moment he was set at liberty, he looked up to the sky and down to the ground, and, stamping with his foot, in a contemplative mood, said, ''Eppur si muove'', that is, ''still it moves'', meaning the Earth.&lt;ref name=Baretti&gt;{{cite book|last=Baretti|first=Giuseppe|title=The Italian Library.

The book was written 124 years after the supposed utterance and became widely published in ''Querelles Littéraires'' in 1761.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Rupert Hall|A. Rupert Hall]], "Galileo nel XVIII secolo," ''Rivista di filosofia,'' 15 (Turin, 1979), pp. 375–78, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Call Me Dave: The Unauthorised Biography of David Cameron''''' is a 2015 book by [[Michael Ashcroft]], a businessman and Conservative peer, and [[Isabel Oakeshott]], a political journalist, about the then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[David Cameron]]. The book, excerpts from which were published in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' prior to publication, received significant media attention, particularly relating to allegations made about Cameron.  It is published by [[Biteback]], a company in which Ashcroft has a majority share, run by political blogger [[Iain Dale]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/21/daily-mail-paid-ashcroft-more-than-50000-for-cameron-book  Jane Martinson, "Mail may have paid Ashcroft six-figure sum for Cameron book, sources say", ''The Guardian'', 21 September 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Piggate===
{{main article|Piggate}}
The book contains an uncorroborated allegation that, during his university years, Cameron put a "private part of his anatomy" into a dead pig's mouth as part of an initiation ceremony for the [[Piers Gaveston Society]]. The allegation was attributed to a Member of Parliament who was a "distinguished Oxford contemporary" of Cameron's.  Ashcroft and Oakeshott failed to receive a response from the purported owner of an alleged photograph of the incident, and since the extract's publication no corroborating evidence has been produced to support the allegation.   A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said that they did not  "need to dignify the book by offering any comment",&lt;ref name="beeb" /&gt; while friends reported him saying that the claim was "utter nonsense".&lt;ref name="The Independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dead-pig-allegations-are-utter-nonsense-david-cameron-tells-friends-10511399.html|title=Dead pig allegations are 'utter nonsense,' David Cameron tells friends|work=The Independent|date=21 September 2015|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Cameron appeared to refer to Ashcroft and the book with a joke that he had had an injection that day and had been told to expect "a little prick, a little stab in the back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dathan|first1=Matt|title=David Cameron compares Lord Ashcroft dead pig claims to a 'stab in the back' as war of words continues|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-compares-lord-ashcroft-dead-pig-claims-to-a-stab-in-the-back-as-war-of-words-continue-10513140.html|accessdate=23 September 2015|publisher=The Independent|date=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication and reception==
[[File:Lord Ashcroft presents Zulu at the Policy Exchange-Crossbench Film Society cropped.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|left|Michael Ashcroft]]
The book is an analysis of Cameron's life, education, early career and political career.  Ashcroft hired Oakeshott in 2013 to co-author the book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/10445706/Lord-Ashcroft-to-write-biography-of-David-Cameron.html |title=Lord Ashcroft to write biography of David Cameron |work=The Telegraph |date=13 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005072539/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/10445706/Lord-Ashcroft-to-write-biography-of-David-Cameron.html |archivedate=October 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; paying a reported £500,000.&lt;ref name=guapok&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/08/call-me-dave-the-unauthorised-biography-michael-ashcroft-isabel-oakeshott-review |title=Call Me Dave by Michael Ashcroft and Isabel Oakeshott review – a pig in a poke |work=The Guardian |author=[[Ian Jack]] |date=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the publicity given to the advance serialisation of the book in the ''Daily Mail'', the initial print run was increased from 6,000 to 35,000 copies, according to Dale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebookseller.com/news/biteback-orders-35000-print-run-call-me-dave-313289  "Biteback orders 35,000 print run on Call Me Dave", ''The Bookseller'', 25 September 2015]. Retrieved 6 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;    Reception to the book was mixed, with some criticising the story as "salacious". In ''[[The Guardian]]'' [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]] wrote that the book was a "Jacobean revenge biography" and described Ashcroft as "one of the more bizarre figures on the fringes of British public life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2015/sep/22/call-me-dave-is-nothing-short-of-a-jacobean-revenge-biography|title=Call Me Dave is nothing short of a Jacobean revenge biography|author=Michael White|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ashcroft's introduction to the book claimed it was "not about settling scores", and that he had sought Oakeshott's involvement to ensure the book was objective, the book was widely viewed as an act of revenge on Cameron for declining to offer Ashcroft, a major [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] donor, a significant position in government.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lord Ashcroft’s Cameron biography bears hallmarks of revenge job|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/21/lord-ashcrofts-cameron-biography-bears-hallmarks-of-revenge-job|accessdate=22 September 2015|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirkup|first1=James|title=A pig, some drugs and a disappointed billionaire: the life of David Cameron|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11880588/A-pig-some-drugs-and-a-disappointed-billionaire-the-life-of-David-Cameron.html|accessdate=21 September 2015|publisher=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Allison Pearson]], writing for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', argued that the nature of the book suggested that Cameron's decision not to promote Ashcroft had been "entirely justified".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pearson|first1=Allison|title=David Cameron's decision not to promote this treacherous, vengeful donor now looks justified|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11882352/David-Camerons-decision-not-to-promote-this-treacherous-vengeful-donor-now-looks-justified.html|accessdate=23 September 2015|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oakeshott argued that they had held back publication until after the [[2015 UK General Election]] to avoid damaging Cameron and the Conservatives in the polls.&lt;ref name="beeb"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lord Ashcroft 'not settling scores' with David Cameron book|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34312744|accessdate=23 September 2015|agency=BBC|date=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Greenslade]], writing for the ''Guardian'', acknowledged the book might have had more impact in the run up to the election, but argued that "most of the negative stuff is historical, unsurprising and of little real consequence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenslade|first1=Roy|title=Ashcroft's David Cameron book doesn't justify the Daily Mail's hype|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/sep/21/ashcrofts-david-cameron-book-doesnt-justify-the-daily-mails-hype|accessdate=26 September 2015|publisher=Guardian|date=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23430">The '''Common Schools Act of 1871''' was legislation of the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[New Brunswick|Province of New Brunswick]], passed by the [[22nd New Brunswick Legislative Assembly]], which replaced the Parish Schools Act of 1858. The legislation aimed to abolish church-run schooling in New Brunswick and replace it with a system of government-run "common schools." The case of [[Maher v. Town Council of Portland]] was initiated as a result, and in the end, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] upheld the Act. The act was stridently opposed by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and its adherents, and a series of clashes between New Brunswick Catholics and the provincial government culminated in the shooting of two people following riots at [[Caraquet, New Brunswick|Caraquet]] in 1875, after which the act was substantially amended to implement a joint religious/secular schooling system.

==Background==
Since 1858, education in New Brunswick had been governed by the Parish Schools Act of 1858.&lt;ref name="Fay (2002) pp.127-128"&gt;[[#refFay2002|Fay (2002)]], pp.127-128.&lt;/ref&gt; It organized all New Brunswick schools under a provincial Board of Education but made no provision for the government to own or establish schools. As a result, the impetus to found new schools was required to originate at a local level, and in practice, most schools were established and operated by churches (particularly, Roman Catholic and Anglican), with the church then receiving a share of the province's education budget in return.&lt;ref name="Murphy (2000)"&gt;[[#refDCBOSweeny|Murphy (2000)]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the diocese of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], for example, there were some 160 Catholic schools operating by 1871, many staffed by [[Catholic religious order|professed religious]], with a significant minority of them offering instruction in French.  There were no standardized texts, and teachers had complete freedom in their choice of curriculum.&lt;ref name="Murphy (2000)"/&gt; Of those priests and professed religious acting as teachers, the majority had no formal teaching credentials. Attendance at schools was enforced by teachers and parents, with no government intervention.&lt;ref name="Snyder (2011)"/&gt;

By 1871, the New Brunswick government had begun to have substantial doubts about the system of education. It was skeptical about the quality of education begin delivered, and it was also concerned about attendance rates, with school attendance in the area of Gloucester falling as low as 55%.&lt;ref name="Snyder (2011) note 1"&gt;[[#refSnyder2011|Snyder (2011)]]. "Quality of education was questionable and attendance was poor. In the predominantly Roman Catholic area of Gloucester attendance rates were the worst: during the last term of the [Parish Schools Act of 1858], 882 pupils were on the register but only 489 attended regularly."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education reform throughout Canada===
By 1871, several Canadian provinces had already implemented provincially run public schooling systems, and others were considering it. In [[Ontario]], [[Egerton Ryerson]] had fought for secularization as a means of keeping power out of the hands of any church, and from 1844 as Chief Superintendent of Education for [[Upper Canada]], he had instituted significant reforms l, leading to the creation of a strong state-run education system. In [[Nova Scotia]], Premier [[Charles Tupper]] had successfully introduced public schooling through his Free School Act of 1864. [[Lemuel Allan Wilmot]], a former New Brunswick Attorney-General and in 1871, its lieutenant governor, had been an outspoken advocate for the creation of a unified taxation-funded public school system in New Brunswick for many years.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"&gt;[[#refDCBOKing|Acheson (2000)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultramontanism===
During the years leading up to 1871, a key conflict within the [[Roman Catholic Church]] concerned the authority of the [[Pope]] over [[secular]] governments.  The doctrine of [[ultramontanism]] asserted that the Pope held supreme authority over all matters spiritual and secular, and it was vigorously pursued by key members of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada, most notably [[Ignace Bourget]], Bishop of [[Montreal]] from 1840 to 1876.&lt;ref name="Sylvain (2000)"&gt;[[#refDCBOBourget|Sylvain (2000)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, [[Pope Pius IX]] published the ''[[Syllabus of Errors]]'', a document collecting several past papal reasonings and presented as a list of "condemned propositions" such as modern [[liberalism]], the supreme power of human reason, the teaching of philosophy and natural science as fields distinct from religion, and, at some considerable length, the [[separation of church and state]]. The syllabus specifically reaffirmed the right of priests to interfere in and direct the course of temporal affairs as well as the supremacy of religious law over civil law. Proposition 45 of the Syllabus rejected the right of civil governments to exercise sole dominion over the teaching of children.&lt;ref name="Haag (1912)"&gt;[[#refHaag1912|Haag (1912)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Syllabus of Errors"&gt;The full text of the Syllabus of Errors is available [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P9SYLL.HTM here].&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, reform-minded governments gaining power throughout Canada were becoming frustrated by church conservativism, and they were keen to lessen their dependence on church infrastructure and mitigate the power wielded by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] in Canadian political affairs.

==Development of Act==
[[File:George Edwin King 1895.jpg|200px|thumb|left|alt=George Edwin King|[[George Edwin King|George E. King]] (1839-1901), the principal architect of the Common Schools Act&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000) note 1"&gt;[[#refDCBOKing|Acheson (2000)]].  "Almost from the time of his arrival in the legislature King's priority was the creation of a universal, publicly supported elementary school system. There is no question that he was the principal architect of the Common Schools Act of 1871."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During the closing sittings of the [[21st New Brunswick Legislative Assembly]] in 1870, a key issue was reform of the New Brunswick school system.  [[George Edwin King]], then an MLA on behalf of the electorate of Saint John County and City, had been, since 1868, developing a bill to create a state-run school system to provide free education to all New Brunswick children. King's bill was tabled in 1870 but failed to receive support and eventually, King withdrew it.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt;

However, in June 1870, New Brunswick's Premier [[Andrew Rainsford Wetmore]] retired from politics to accept a position on the Supreme Court, and King was able to seek and receive appointments as the new Premier and Attorney-General. He revived his Common Schools Bill and campaigned on it at the 1870 election.  He was successfully returned to office and took leadership of the [[22nd New Brunswick Legislative Assembly]].&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt;

However the new government proved unstable, and in February 1871, King lost the confidence of parliament and was forced to resign. [[George Luther Hatheway]] took up the mantle of Premier, with King as his Attorney-General. While Hatheway and King were opposed on many political issues, they were united in their support of public schooling, and on April 12, 1871, King reintroduced his Common Schools Bill to parliament on behalf of Hatheway's government.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt;

==Enactment==
King's bill prompted a long and bitter debate in the New Brunswick parliament. Members opposed to the bill included most of the parliament's Catholics, some Anglicans, and also some members against compulsory assessment.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt; On May 5, 1871, free school supporters proposed an amendment to the bill making schools under the act be non-sectarian. The amendment was passed by a 25-10 vote.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt; The bill, as a whole, was passed on May 17, 1871 and it was signed into law as the Common Schools Act of 1871.&lt;ref name="Snyder (2011)"&gt;[[#refSnyder2011|Snyder (2011)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The act came into effect on January 1, 1872.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt;  It contained various provisions that had the effect of shutting down religious schooling in New Brunswick. While teachers were permitted to open and close school with Bible reading and the [[Lord's Prayer]], they were prohibited from the teaching of [[catechism]] courses and from wearing religious garb, and schools were forbidden from displaying religious symbols.&lt;ref name="Bushnell (1992) p.137"&gt;[[#refBushnell1992|Bushnell (1992)]], p.137.&lt;/ref&gt; Control of the school system was given to the Executive Council, exercising its power through the New Brunswick Board of Education.  The Board of Education held powers under the act to dictate curriculum and textbook content, require teachers to meet certain standards of qualification, and set the work conditions and employment terms of educators.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt;

==Opposition==
[[File:Bishop John Sweeny.jpg|200 px|right|thumb|[[John Sweeny (bishop)|Bishop John Sweeny]] led Catholic opposition to the Common Schools Act.]]
The government claimed that non-denominational, mandatory schooling would improve access to education for New Brunswick's children. However, opponents of the legislation claimed that sole responsibility for the education of children lay with parents, and they resented government interference in what they saw as a parental duty through the imposition of mandatory schooling. Opponents of the legislation were primarily religious organisations including the Anglican Church and the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Snyder (2011)"/&gt;

Hatheway died in June 1872, and King regained the position of Premier of New Brunswick.&lt;ref name="Spray (2000)"&gt;[[#refDCOBHatheway|Spray (2000)]].&lt;/ref&gt; King found himself facing strong Roman Catholic opposition to the Common Schools Act, led by Bishop [[John Sweeny (bishop)|John Sweeny]].

The Catholics, under Sweeny, made an appeal to the Canadian federal government in Ottawa, seeking disallowance of the act. They claimed that Catholic schools had existed under the Parish Schools Act of 1858 and so Catholics had constitutional rights to sectarian schools under the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]]. The appeal did not find any support in the federal cabinet and was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt; The Catholics then attempted to fight the bill in the federal House of Commons in the spring of 1872. Roman Catholic member for New Brunswick [[John Costigan]] presented a motion calling on the government to disallow the New Brunswick Common Schools Act, with the support of fellow New Brunswicker [[Timothy Warren Anglin]], but the motion was defeated on the floor of the House.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt; Similarly, a proposal by Quebec Premier [[Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau]] to ask the Queen to amend the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]] to protect sectarian schooling failed to win majority support.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt;

In the final result, the only action taken by the federal government was to seek a constitutional opinion from crown lawyers in London and to call on the New Brunswick government to reconsider its position.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt; King responded to this call some five months later with a 12-page memorandum in which he argued that Catholic public schools had never been legally recognised in New Brunswick and so had not lost any rights or privileges as a result of the legislative change to the schooling system.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt;

Objectors to the Common Schools Act launched a challenge to the act in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. In 1873, the court dismissed the objectors' suit and found in favour of the government, but in the course of the case, it levelled several criticisms at the act's assessment clauses, which King's government addressed by passing supplementary retroactive assessment legislation.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt;

Following the failure of the court challenge, New Brunswick Bishop [[John Sweeny (bishop)|John Sweeny]] attended the provincial council of the Roman Catholic Church in Quebec on May 18, 1873, and he invited the bishops of Quebec to intervene in the New Brunswick school question. The following day, [[Ignace Bourget]], Bishop of [[Montreal]], and [[Louis-François Richer Laflèche|Louis-François Laflèche]], of [[Trois-Rivières]], accepted Sweeny's invitation by issuing a prepared statement opposing the Common Schools Act in the name of the Roman Catholic Church. The statement had the effect of inciting several federal Catholic MPs to break ranks from the government over the issue. At roughly the same time, New Brunswick MP [[John Costigan]] moved a motion on the floor of the House of Commons requesting for the governor-general to disallow the New Brunswick acts relating to assessment for local schools. The motion was successful, but Prime Minister [[John Alexander Macdonald]] refused to disallow the legislation. Facing revolt in his own ranks over the issue, Macdonald agreed to pay $5,000 towards the costs of an appeal to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] (then Canada's highest court) by the New Brunswick Catholics.&lt;ref name="Murphy (2000)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sylvain (2000)"/&gt; In 1874, the Judicial Committee gave its decision in [[Maher v. Town Council of Portland|Maher v. Town of Portland]], ruling that the Common Schools Act was constitutional and did not infringe the guarantees for denominational schools set out in section 93 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]].

During the legislative and parliamentary challenges, Catholics, organized by their bishops, resisted the implementation of the Common Schools Act at a grassroots level by refusing to pay school taxes. The provincial government responded by imprisoning priests and seizing the property of tax evaders.&lt;ref name="Murphy (2000)"/&gt; In late 1873, King held meetings with Sweeney] to seek a compromise. Sweeny offered to bring an end to the Catholic opposition in return for the government under conditions, but the Executive Council refused his offer.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt; By 1874, the debate was still continuing in the New Brunswick Legislative Assembly and growing more bitter. At the last sitting of the before the 1874 election, the Assembly debated both a proposed amendment to the Common Schools Act and a motion abjuring federal interference in the province's schools. King accused the Catholic opposition of opposing the act for [[ultramontanism|ultramontanist]] reasons as part of a long-term Roman Catholic plan for domination of Europe and Canada.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt; King went on to say, "If we once abandon the strong line of defence that is along the heights of equality [...] the end will be the overthrow of our rights and independence of action."&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt;

The amendment was defeated 24-12, and the non-interference motion carried by the same margin.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt;

The 1874 New Brunswick election was fought solely over the issue of common schools, with King's government achieving an overwhelming victory, claiming 36 of the 41 seats.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000) note 2"&gt;[[#refDCBOKing|Acheson (2000)]]. "The 1874 election in New Brunswick was the schools election. There was no other issue. [...] King's government won 36 of the 41 seats."&lt;/ref&gt;

==1875 Caraquet riots==
[[File:Fusillade Caraquet.jpg|right|thumb|An artist's depiction of the Caraquet shootings, circa 1875]]
In 1872, [[Robert Young (Canadian politician)|Robert Young]] was appointed as President of New Brunswick's Executive Council, which had ultimate control of the New Brunswick school system under the terms of the Common Schools Act. A particular priority for Young was implementing the Common Schools Act in [[Gloucester County, New Brunswick|Gloucester County]].  Gloucester County, which included Young's home town of [[Caraquet, New Brunswick|Caraquet]], had mainly [[Acadians]] (descendants of French colonists) and was strongly Roman Catholic.&lt;ref name="Cyr (2000)"&gt;[[#refDCBOYoung|Cyr (2000)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Young faced deeply entrenched opposition to the act in Gloucester. In 1873, Gloucester magistrates refused to enforce the provisions of the act. Young responded by having them replaced. At the 1874 elections, although only 5 of the 41 members elected to the Legislative Assembly were not supporters of the Common Schools Act, both of the members elected in Gloucester were in the opposition.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt; Gloucester elected [[Théotime Blanchard]] and [[Kennedy Francis Burns]], both Catholics who were firm opponents of the act.&lt;ref name="Cyr (2000)"/&gt;

The town of Caraquet was opposed to the Common Schools Act and most of its residents had for some time refused to pay the schools tax in protest. In 1874 a meeting was held by the townspeople of Caraquet at which public officials were appointed. Caraquet's small Protestant minority questioned the legality of the appointments, and on January 4, 1875 Young held his own, secret, meeting at which he appointed Protestants to the same positions.&lt;ref name="Cyr (2000)"/&gt;

On January 14, 1875, a public meeting was convened with the aim of imposing the school tax on Caraquet. The meeting ended in a scuffle.  On January 15, a group of Caraquet Acadians held a public protest against further attempts to apply the act. During the protest, drunken demonstrators caused property damage to several premises including a store owned by Young. The demonstrators threatened Young's wife and employees.&lt;ref name="Cyr (2000)"/&gt;

On January 25, ten police constables bearing arrest warrants arrived in Caraquet to identity and arrest the demonstrators who had damaged Young's store. They were still in Caraquet on January 26, when 20 English-speaking "volunteers," recruited by Young, arrived in the town to assist in the arrests.&lt;ref name="Cyr (2000) note 1"&gt;[[#refDCBOYoung|Cyr (2000)]]. "On 26 January, at [Young's] request, some ten constables bearing arrest warrants went to Caraquet to charge those who had been responsible for the riot on 15 January. The next day about 20 English-speaking "volunteers," who had been recruited by Young, came to back them up."&lt;/ref&gt; The "volunteers" gained entry to the house of one André Albert, at which Acadians were gathered, resulting in an exchange of gunfire. One Acadian (Louis Mailloux) and one militiaman (John Gifford) were shot and killed during the exchange. Nine Acadians were tried as accessories to the death of Gifford but were acquitted. Public sentiment in Gloucester held Young responsible for both deaths.&lt;ref name="Cyr (2000)"/&gt;

==Amendment==
The Caraquet deaths brought a realisation to both sides of the school debate that compromise was required on the issue. In the spring of 1875, the Catholic opposition, headed by [[Kennedy Francis Burns]], met with the government to work out what would eventually become substantial amendments to the workings of the act.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt; The changes, based on proposals originally drafted by Sweeney, were carried out by amendments to the act's subordinate regulations, and they were kept secret for fear of inviting controversy.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000) note 3"&gt;[[#refDCBOKing|Acheson (2000)]]. "Even these limited concessions were so controversial that the new regulations, in which the bishops reluctantly acquiesced, were not made public and the schools act itself remained unchanged."&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendments allowed for a less arduous method of certification for religious teachers in which they would still have to complete examinations but would not have to attend [[Normal School]] classes. The determination of textbook content would be made in consultation with the churches, with passages offensive to the church excised. Church-owned school buildings would be permitted to be used, pending the decision by local school trustees to lease them from the church, and religious instruction could occur in such buildings if the regular school day was not shortened for the purpose. The effect of the arrangements regarding church buildings and religious schooling was to limit Catholic education to urban centres and to move further argument back down to the level of the local school boards.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt;

==Legacy==

The Common Schools Act of 1871 has been suggested as "the most significant piece of social legislation in 19th-century New Brunswick."&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt; By 1878 the number of students enrolled in the public school system had more than doubled, and the number of public school teachers had increased by half.&lt;ref name="Acheson (2000)"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4666">{{Anthropology}}

'''David Murray Schneider''' (November 11, 1918, [[Brooklyn, New York]] – October 30, 1995, [[Santa Cruz, California]]) was an [[Americans|American]] [[cultural anthropologist]], best known for his studies of [[kinship]] and as a major proponent of the symbolic anthropology approach to cultural anthropology.

== Biography ==
He received his B.S. in 1940 and his M.S. from [[Cornell University]] in 1941. He received his PhD in [[Social Anthropology]] from Harvard in 1949, based on fieldwork on the [[Micronesia]]n island of [[Yap]].

After completing his graduate work, he first taught at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. In 1960, he accepted a position at the [[University of Chicago]], where he spent most of his career, teaching in Anthropology and the Committee on Human Development. He was Chairman of Anthropology from 1963 to 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/951127/schneider.shtml Obituary: David Schneider, Anthropology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Chicago, Schneider was director of the Kinship Project, a study supported by the National Science Foundation that looked at how middle-class families in the United States and Great Britain respond to their kinship relations. His findings challenged the common-sense assumption that kinship in Anglo-American cultures is primarily about recognizing biological relatedness. While a rhetoric of "blood" ties is an important conceptual structuring device in US and British kinship systems, cultural and social considerations are more important. The discoveries he demonstrated through a series of books, most famously ''American Kinship: a cultural account'', revolutionized and revitalized the study of kinship within anthropology, on the one hand, and contributed to the theoretical basis of [[feminist anthropology]], gender studies, and lesbian and gay studies, on the other.

Schneider critiqued the so-called Western theories of kinship by accusing its supporters of being [[ethnocentric]].

As a teacher, Schneider was also known for taking on and encouraging students studying nontraditional topics, and as a mentor to women and lesbian or gay graduate students, who often otherwise had difficulty finding mentors.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Esther. (2000) ''Margaret Mead Made Me Gay: personal essays, public ideas''. Durham, NC: Duke University Press. p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring from Chicago in 1986, he joined the anthropology department at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], where he remained until his death in 1995.

The '''Department for Education and Skills''' ('''DfES''') was a [[United Kingdom government department]] between 2001 and 2007,  responsible for the [[Education in England|education system]] (including higher education and [[adult learning]]) as well as children's services in [[England]].

The department was led by [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills]].

The DfES had offices at four main locations: [[London]] (both at the Sanctuary Buildings and Caxton House), [[Sheffield]] (Moorfoot),  [[Darlington]] (Mowden Hall), and [[Runcorn]] (Castle View House). The DfES was also represented in [[regional Government Offices]].

The DfES had jurisdiction only in England as education was the responsibility of the [[Scottish Government]], [[Welsh Assembly Government]] and the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]. 

On 28 June 2007, the DfES was split up into the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] (DCSF) and the [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]]. The DCSF was later reorganised as the [[Department for Education]] in 2010.

==History==
The '''Department of Education and Science''' was created in 1964 with the merger of the offices of [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Minister of Education]] and the Minister of Science, with [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]] as minister.
[[Image:Departmentforeducationandskills.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Sanctuary Buildings]]

In 1992 the responsibility for [[science]] was transferred to the [[Cabinet Office]]'s Office of Public Service and the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]]'s [[Office of Science and Technology]], and the department was renamed '''Department for Education'''.

In 1995, in the reshuffle after the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1995|Conservative leadership election]] of that year, the department merged with the [[Department for Work and Pensions|Department of Employment]] to become the '''Department for Education and Employment''' (DfEE).

After the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]], the employment functions were transferred to the new [[Department for Work and Pensions]], with the DfEE becoming the '''Department for Education and Skills''' (DfES).

In 2007, the responsibilities for adult education, [[further education]], and [[higher education]] were transferred to the new Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. The remainder of the education system moved to the DCSF.

==Permanent Secretary==
The permanent secretary of a UK Department is the senior civil servant.  While working under the direction of the political ministers (normally members of the relevant government in the UK, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland), the PS (and other senior civil servants, especially the Finance Director) has many traditional and statutory responsibilities that are aimed at ensuring that government departments are, as far as possible, run in the public interest.

'''Educational television''' or '''learning television''' is the use of [[television program]]s in the field of [[distance education]]. It may be in the form of individual [[television programs]] or dedicated [[specialty channel]]s that is often associated with [[cable television in the United States]] as [[Public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) channel providers.

There are also [[adult education]] programs for an older audience; many of these are [[instructional television]] or "telecourse" services that can be taken for college credit. Examples of these include [[Open University]] programs on [[BBC]] television in the UK.

Many [[children's television series]] are educational, ranging from dedicated learning programs to those that indirectly teach the viewers. Some series are written to have a specific [[moral]] behind every episode, often explained at the end by the character that learned the lesson.

In the [[social aspects of television]], several studies have found that educational television has many advantages, like WeTv Arabia world education television channel no.336 in UAE. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20060202123356/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/corporate/about_us/index.cfm Media Awareness Network], explains in its article, The Good Things about Television, that television can be a very powerful and effective learning tool for children if used wisely. The article states that television can help young people discover where they fit into society, develop closer relationships with peers and family, and teach them to understand complex social aspects of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/television/good_things_tv.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 3, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203124845/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/television/good_things_tv.cfm |archivedate=February 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican TV producer Miguel Sabido pioneered in the 1970s the use of [[telenovela]] to disseminate the government's policy views to mass audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Rosin, "Life Lessons: How Soap Operas Can Change the World." ''The New Yorker'', June 5, 2006, pp. 40-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabriela Soto Laveaga, "'Let's become fewer': Soap operas, contraception, and nationalizing the Mexican family in an overpopulated world." ''Sexuality Research and Social Policy''. September 2007, vol. 4,, no. 3 pp. 19-33.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Sabido Method" has been adopted by a number of countries, including India, Kenya, Peru, and China.&lt;ref&gt;Rosin, "Life Lessons" p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* [[Annenberg Foundation]] (The Annenberg Channel)
* [[NASA TV]]
* [[TVOntario]]
* [[Discovery channels]]

The '''television''' medium can and has been used for a multitude of educational purposes. Some television programs are explicitly educational, while others only incidentally so. Some formats blend the two in the attempt to amuse but also retain some educational value.

==TV reforms for education-based programs==
In the time of '''TV vs. Radio''', the early 1960s were an era of change. Historian Michael Curtin recounted that then-FCC-chair, Jon Doerfor and TV network heads, had come to an agreement that most of TV was based on commercialism and emphasized entertainment too much. To help counterbalance this, there was a plan organized to produce more serious news and documentary programs. This policy was placed just in time for networks to expand their news coverage on the Kennedy-Nixon campaigns and debates. This increase in coverage stirred up the polls as those who ''saw'' the debates, with Kennedy's good looks and camera confidence, decided he had won, whereas those who ''listened'' were more impressed with Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;Hilmes, Michele, "Only Connect: A Cultural History of Broadcasting in the United States" Pg. 219, Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1962, TV reform was in full swing, and 400 prime-time documentaries had been produced, as opposed to a total of zero back in 1957. Curtin noted that news programs were extended to full half-hour segments,and foreign and domestic issues were receiving heightened degrees of attention.&lt;ref&gt;Hilmes, Michele, "Only Connect: A Cultural History of Broadcasting in the United States" Pg. 219-220, Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edutainment and Telenovelas==
Some television programs are designed with primarily educational purposes in mind, although they might rely heavily on entertainment to communicate their educational messages. In children's programing, [[edutainment]] becomes fun and interesting for the child but can still be educational.

Other television programs are designed to raise social awareness. One form of edutainment popular in Latin America is the educational [[telenovela]]. Miguel Sabido, a producer of telenovelas from the 1970s on, has combined communication theory with pro-health/education messages to educate audiences throughout [[Latin America]] about family planning, literacy, and other topics. He developed a model which incorporated the work of [[Albert Bandura]] and other theorists, as well as research to determine whether programs impacted audience behavior.

The first ever television series produced in the Pacific Island country of [[Vanuatu]], entitled ''[[Love Patrol]]'' and launched in 2007, was praised as an edutainment series, as it aimed to educate viewers on the issue of [[AIDS]], while simultaneously providing an entertaining story.&lt;ref name="islandsbusiness1"&gt;[http://www.islandsbusiness.com/islands_business/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace=MiddleMiddle/focusModuleID=17727/overideSkinName=issueArticle-full.tpl "Health: LOVE PATROL"], Nicole Gooch, ''Islands Business''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hulu Original TV series [[East Los High]], is backed by a health initiative to teach healthy sexual behaviors (e.g. using protection during sexual intercourse, getting checked for sexually transmitted diseases).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2016/01/11/451940463/east-los-high-isnt-just-a-soapy-teen-drama-its-also-a-science-experiment|title='East Los High' Isn't Just A Soapy Teen Drama — It's Also A Science Experiment|author=|date=|website=npr.org|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment==
Some television shows incorporate a considerable degree of historical or factual information while attempting to make the presentation or framing of such content entertaining or exciting. By making learning seem "exciting" they can be said to stimulate curiosity. The presence of edutainment is especially evident in [[children's television series]], such as ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''[[Teletubbies]]'', and ''[[Dora The Explorer]]''. Discovery Channel is also known for its various shows that follow that theme, including ''[[MythBusters]]''. Sometimes these programs may be more entertaining than educational, and may replace educational shows in the televisions program lineup. The History Channel has transitioned from producing primarily factual and historical documentaries, to more sensational, dramatic, and supposedly entertaining programs, with educational content a secondary concern.

Television series notable for negative reception, from around the world, either by published critics, by network executives or by audience response, can be judged based on poor quality, the lack of a budget, rapid cancellation, very low viewership, offensive content, and/or negative impact on other series on the same channel. In some cases, a show that is acceptable on its own merits can be put in a position where it does not belong and be judged "worst ever." In many cases, "worst television series ever" lists are slanted toward more contemporary shows, in recent memory.

The [[Children's Television Act]] of 1990, which was first fully enforced in 1996, requires  broadcast television stations in the United States to carry a minimum of three hours of "[[E/I|educational/informational]]" programming geared directly at children. The move prompted an exodus of non-educational children's programming to cable television and largely failed in its efforts to expand the amount of educational television on the airwaves (in fact, children's television in general has declined significantly on broadcast television since the act was imposed, although it can be argued that the E/I regulations could very well be the ''only'' thing keeping children's television on broadcast airwaves in the 2010s).

==Incidental educational value==
Some programs are primarily aimed at entertainment, but may contain an incidental amount of educational content. Educational content may be inherent to the design of the show, such as with medical dramas where the plot invariably explores anatomical and biological issues. The [[Sentinel Award]], which is administered by the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[Annenberg Center for Communication]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] and the [[National Cancer Institute]] ([[National Cancer Institute|NCI]]), is given each year to programs that address health and medical issues in their storylines.  2006's nominees/winners include:
* ''[[Numb3rs]]'' - for a storyline about fighting crime using mathematics.
* ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' - for story lines about organ transplantation and cancer.
* ''[[As the World Turns]]'' - for a breast cancer storyline that involved a major character.
* ''[[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]]'' - for a storyline about a kidney transplant.
* ''[[Ben &amp; Izzy]]'' - for a storyline about two children, Ben from America and Izzy from Jordan, who form a close bond despite their different cultural backgrounds.

While some programs are typically "pure" entertainment, they may foray into educational content at select times. For older viewers, individual [[situation comedy]] [[episode]]s also occasionally serve as educational entertainment vehicles. These episodes are sometimes described in United States [[television commercial]] parlance as [[very special episode]]s. As early as the 1950s, children-aimed shows like "Watch Mr Wizard" were made which could be considered edutainment.

On the other hand, some programs may seem for the lay public to contain educational content, but are actually completely fictional. It is up to experts to figure out if a specific TV program uses realistic or fictional plots. One example for only seemingly real programs are [[mockumentary|mockumentaries]].

:This article is about the university, For the programming language, see [[Executive Systems Problem Oriented Language]].''

The '''Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral''' (or '''ESPOL''') is a [[public university]] located in [[Guayaquil]], [[Guayas Province]] in [[Ecuador]]. '''ESPOL''' has five [[Faculty (university)|University Faculties]] or [[Faculty (university)|Schools]] fifteen [[Research center]]s and several associated centers providing twenty-six [[Undergraduate degree]]s and ten [[master's degree]] and research in multiple areas of knowledge.

== History ==

=== Foundation years ===
On October 24, 1958, through Executive Decree 1664 by President Camilo Ponce Enriquez, the Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral was created&lt;ref name="hist1"&gt;Vekiz Litardo, Jaime. &lt;U&gt;La Historia de la ESPOL&lt;/U&gt;. Ecuador&lt;/ref&gt; as a higher education institution due to increasing demands for a scientific and technological education for the [[Geography of Ecuador#La Costa .28the coast.29|Littoral Region]].

On Tuesday, May 19, 1959, ESPOL was inaugurated, and the following Monday,May 25, 1959, classes began. Its first location, due to the lack of its own campus, was the old "Casona" building on "Chile" Street of the Universidad de Guayaquil. The area around the historical Peñas area provided a central location in the city, and the buildings in that area were bought by ESPOL with an initial payment of 12 million [[Ecuadorian sucre|sucres]].

On 1969, The Quinto Guayas Battalion, gave to ESPOL the area between the [[Simón Bolívar]] embankment and Loja Street, where the four departments that existed at that time ([[Engineering]] in [[Geology]], [[Mining engineering]] and [[Petroleum engineering]]; [[Electrical engineering]]; [[Naval engineering]] and [[Mechanical engineering]]) were co-located.

On 1973, [[Ecuadorian Navy#Marines|The Naval Infantry Corps]] of Ecuador moved from their base in Guayaquil, and in their place, the new installations for the Facultad de [[Marine propulsion|Ingenieria Maritima]] y [[Marine Sciences|Ciencias del Mar]] were constructed.

=== Changing campuses ===
In 1995 ESPOL began to move from its [[Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral#Campus de Peñas|historical Campus]] to the new campus that was being built in the outskirts of the city. The [[Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral#Campus Gustavo Galindo|new campus]] included over {{convert|700|ha}} and included a [[protected forest]] which the university took over.

=== Recent history ===
ESPOL is involved in multiple changes and projects. Some of the changes are new buildings and facilities.

On the facilities side ESPOL, in 2009, started the construction of [[Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral#PARCON|PARCON]] short for '''Parque del Conocimiento''' (Trans: Knowledge Park), where all the research centers of ESPOL will be located in new buildings. In 2009, ESPOL built a set of buildings to host the prepolitenico (first year general studies). In 2010, ESPOL started the construction of the new EDCON building.

New research centers such as [[Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral#CIDIS|CIDIS]] begun their work as new entities based on the old [https://web.archive.org/web/20110824050307/http://www.vlir.espol.edu.ec/ VLIR-ESPOL] program.

== Campuses ==

=== Campus de Peñas ===
With 2.5 [[Hectare|ha]] and located near the [[historical]] center of [[Guayaquil]], Las Peñas campus was the center of the academic life of ESPOL. However it is impossible for the campus to grow to accommodate the needs of a modern university, therefore, almost everything has moved into the '''Gustavo Galindo''' campus for the 2011-2012 Academic year.

=== Campus Gustavo Galindo ===
With an extension of 724 [[Hectare|ha]], the Gustavo Galindo Campus is the biggest and main campus of ESPOL. Its location in the Via Perimetral ([[Highway]]) allowing easy access to commuting students. The central administration of the university, the schools administration and research centers are located in this campus. Its infrastructure is the result of the developing plan (Plan de Desarrollo 1983–1992) as well as the creation of the new PARCON

=== Campus Via de la Costa ===
The Campus Via de la Costa, located on the coast of the [[Santa Elena, Ecuador|Santa Elena]] [[Province]]  hosts the CENAIM-ESPOL Foundation and the Sea related degrees and research.

'''''Game Tycoon''''' is a [[business simulation game]] focused on production of video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/932120.asp|title=Game Tycoon - PC|publisher=gamerankings.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has been largely ridiculed, especially for some parts not translated from German to English.
&lt;!--
*Reception
[[X-Play]] gave the game a 1 out of 5, mentioning that parts of the game are still not translated from the original German. They also said that it was barely a game.--&gt;

== Gameplay ==
Game play is centered on the full production of video-game making; from production of an engine, concept design, physical design, packaging, licensing deals, market campaigns, and reviews.

The game starts off in 1982 with somewhat limited availability of features. Eventually, more options are made for engines and packaging, etc.

A '''gap year''', also known as a '''sabbatical year''', is typically a year-long break between high school and college/university. During the gap year a student normally travels or maintains some type of regular work. Students who take gap years typically undergo a growth in maturity and are better prepared to benefit from higher education or decide the form of education they wish to pursue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hercampus.com/high-school/preparing-college/whats-gap-year-college-should-you-take-one |work=Her Campus |first=Tricia |last=Taormina |title=What's a Gap Year Before College (&amp; Should You Take One)? |date=April 4, 2013 |access-date=6 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150809124400/http://www.hercampus.com/high-school/preparing-college/whats-gap-year-college-should-you-take-one |archive-date=9 August 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students can also take gap years after graduating from undergraduate study and before entry into graduate school. These students might take advanced courses in math or language studies, learn a trade, study art, [[volunteer]], travel, take [[internship]]s, play sports, or get involved in cultural exchanges. Studies indicate that students who take a gap year perform better academically than those who do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=jennifer|title=The Academic and Career Advantages of Taking a Gap Year|url=https://www.noodle.com/articles/the-academic-and-career-advantages-of-taking-a-gap-year190|website=noodle.com|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many parents worry their students will deter continuation of their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/hubs/gapyear/7956017/Gap-year-advice-for-parents-Are-they-a-good-thing.html|title=Gap year advice for parents: Are they a good thing?|date=2010-08-20|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Gap years first became common in the 1960's where the young, baby-boom generation wanted to get away from the severity of war from their parents generation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gapyear.com/articles/features/the-history-of-the-gap-year|title=The History of the Gap Year|date=2012-05-30|work=Gap Year|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At first, the primary purpose of the gap year was for countries to exchange cultural ideals in the hope to deter future wars from occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gapyear.com/articles/features/the-history-of-the-gap-year|title=The History of the Gap Year|date=2012-05-30|work=Gap Year|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of this exchange was the growth of the gap year industry.

The introduction of gap year companies in the 1960's and 1970's started the gap year industry. With the long term success of organizations like [[Topdeck]], [[Flight Centre]], and [[Raleigh International]], the gap year industry developed rapidly. In 1967, Nicholas Maclean-Bristol created Project Trust, which sent three volunteers to [[Ethiopia]] from the [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://projecttrust.org.uk/our-story/|title=Our Story {{!}} Project Trust|work=Project Trust|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this was to help the nation develop, but also build their own skills. In 1973, Graham Turner innovated the new gap year industry by purchasing a bus and selling tickets to Kathmandu. This lead to Turner creating [[Topdeck]] and [[Flight Centre]], which are successful gap year companies today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gapyear.com/articles/features/the-history-of-the-gap-year|title=The History of the Gap Year|date=2012-05-30|work=Gap Year|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] and Colonel [[John Blashford-Snell]] began [[Operation Drake]] which what is now known as [[Raleigh International]], an expedition voyage around the world following [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake's]] route. 


In 1969, the first gap year organization was founded in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. The organization called [[Dynamy]] was founded with the intentions of teaching young people self confidence and the role they play in a large community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dynamy.org/about/history/|title=History {{!}} Dynamy Internship Year - Worcester, MA|website=www.dynamy.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, the gap year idea was promoted by Cornelius H. Bull in the [[United States]] to allow students more time for individual growth. Cornelius saw that students needed a bridge between high school and college that would help develop more hands-on skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interimprograms.com/p/about-us.html|title=The Interim Advantage, Team &amp; History|work=Center for Interim Programs|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, he founded the Center for Interim Programs in 1980 which had goals of increasing self-awareness and developing new cultural perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.winterline.com/history-gap-year/|title=History of the Gap Year - Winterline|date=2017-12-25|work=Winterline|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==
===Australia and New Zealand===
Australians and New Zealanders have a tradition of travelling overseas independently at a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://auspost.com.au/travel-essentials/how-australians-travel|title=Travel trends - how Australians travel|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In New Zealand this is known as "doing an OE" ([[Overseas experience]]). Sometimes this is limited to one year, but at times Australians and New Zealanders will remain overseas for longer, many working short-term in service industry jobs to fund their travels. Europe and Asia are popular destinations for Gap Year travels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gapyear.com/articles/travel-ideas/top-10-gap-year-destinations|title=Gap Year Destinations|date=2013-07-23|work=Gap Year|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, exchange programs and youth benefits provide many opportunities for young people to gain experience through travel in a gap year. The Gap Year Association provided approximately four million dollars in 2016 in the form of scholarships and need based grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gap Year Data and Benefits |url=https://www.gapyearassociation.org/data-benefits.php |website=Gap Year Association |publisher=Gap Year Association |accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
The Time Credit system in [[Belgium]] entitles employees of one year per lifetime of absence from their job, in order to prevent burn-out and to provide an opportunity to pursue other important things in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brussels.irisnet.be/working-and-doing-business/working/when-you-dont-have-a-job/career-breaks |title=Career breaks |work=Centre d'Informatique pour la Région Bruxelloise (CIRB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
In Denmark during the late 1990s the percentage of students continuing their education directly after high school was down to 25%. Along with this drop there was a rise in the number of students enrolling and graduating within ten years of finishing high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sievertsen |first1=Hans Henrik |title=From Birth to Graduation |url=https://www.econ.ku.dk/forskning-og-publikationer/Publikationer/ph.d_serie_2007-/Ph.D.169.pdf |website=econ.ku.dk |publisher=University of Copenhagen |accessdate=20 September 2018 |location=Copenhagen, Denmark |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data also shows that women in Denmark take more gap years than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sievertsen |first1=Hans Henrik |title=From Birth to Graduation |url=https://www.econ.ku.dk/forskning-og-publikationer/Publikationer/ph.d_serie_2007-/Ph.D.169.pdf |website=econ.ku.dk |publisher=University of Copenhagen |accessdate=20 September 2018 |location=Copenhagen, Denmark |pages=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denmark]] has sought to limit the number of students who take a year out, penalizing students who delay their education to travel abroad or work full-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.berlingske.dk/article/20041129/danmark/111290231/ |title=Sabbatår - sundt eller skadeligt? |trans-title=Sabbatical - healthy or harmful? |language=da |last=Andersen |first=Lars Otto |date=29 November 2004 |newspaper=[[Berlingske Tidende]] |accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, it was announced that fewer students than before had taken a year out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.s-fou.dk/page.php?pagegroupid=2&amp;id=149 |title=Stadigt yngre studerende med færre sabbatår starter på universiteterne |work=Universitet og Bygningsstyrelsen, [[Ministry of Science, Innovation and Higher Education (Denmark)|Ministeriet for Videnskab, teknologi og Udvikling]] |language=da |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719130913/http://www.s-fou.dk/page.php?pagegroupid=2&amp;id=149 |archivedate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, the [[Danish government]] proposed a new law which gives a bonus to students who refrain from a year out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jp.dk/uknews/article1684210.ece |title=Committee proposes cash incentives for speedy students |date=5 May 2009 |work=[[Jyllands-Posten]] |publisher=[[The Copenhagen Post]]|accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ghana]], most senior high school leavers have a year out from August to the August of the following year, although this is not mandatory.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} {{Explain|date=August 2018}}

===Israel===
In [[Israel]], it is customary for young adults who have completed their mandatory military service to go [[backpacking (travel)|backpacking]] abroad in groups before starting university or full-time work.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Israel has also become a popular gap year travel destination for thousands of young Jewish adults from abroad each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://judaism.about.com/od/education/p/israel_phs.htm |title=The Gap Year: Jews Take on Israel After High School |work=about.com |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are over 10,000 participants in the [[Masa Israel Journey]] gap year annually.{{Explain|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.masaisrael.org/meet_masa_israel/about |title=About us |work=Masa Israel Journey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
The employment practice known as [[simultaneous recruiting of new graduates]] matches students with jobs before graduation, meaning sabbaticals are highly unusual in [[Japan]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} {{Explain|date=August 2018}}

While unusual, gap years in Japan are not completely unheard of. Some students will take a gap year or two to readjust or reassess their career path or school of choice if not accepted into the school they had originally hoped for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wright |first1=Steve |title=Do Japanese students take a gap year after high school? Is it unusual? |url=https://www.quora.com/Do-Japanese-students-take-a-gap-year-after-high-school-Is-it-usual |website=Quora |publisher=Quora |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===
While waiting for their [[Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board|JAMB]] result after secondary school, Nigerian youths usually learn a trade or skill, or enrol for another academic program (remedial, pre-degree, JUPEB, A-levels, IJMB, etc.) to increase their chances of getting into a university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teenstalkaboutit.com/afterschool|title=Teens talk about it!|website=teenstalkaboutit.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===
In Romania, after finishing high school, for some universities an [[admission exam]] is required {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. People who do not succeed in passing sometimes take a gap year to study, usually passing in their second attempt.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} This is common in medicine and engineering.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Similar to the way that some students travel during a gap year, many Romanian students instead study abroad and in recent years the number of students who choose to do this has been growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Butum |first1=L. |title=The importance of international experience for Romanian students in establishing career priorities |journal=Management &amp; Marketing. Challenges for the Knowledge Society |date=2017 |volume=12 |issue=2017 |pages=155–170 |doi=10.1515/mmcks-2017-0010 |url=https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/mmcks.2017.12.issue-1/mmcks-2017-0010/mmcks-2017-0010.pdf |accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In the [[Republic of South Africa]], taking a year off is common for those in more [[affluent]] classes.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} School leavers often travel abroad to gain life experience.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} It is not uncommon for gap year students to travel to [[Cape Town]] for life experience.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Common [[Volunteering|volunteer]] opportunities include working in [[animal welfare]] or [[tree planting]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the practice of taking a gap year – seen as an interim period of 7 or 8 months between completing secondary education and starting university – began to develop in the 1970s. The period was seen as a time for gaining life experience through travel or volunteering. Universities appear to welcome post-gap-year applicants on the same basis as those going straight to university from previous education.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The number of students aged 18 opting to defer their university place in order to take a gap year reached a peak of 21,020 in 2008.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yearoutgroup.org/connect/media-researchers/|title=Year Out Group - Gap Year {{!}} Cultural Exchange {{!}} Voluntary Work Abroad|website=www.yearoutgroup.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614074453/http://www.yearoutgroup.org/connect/media-researchers/|archivedate=14 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure crashed to 7,320 in 2011&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; – a year before the introduction of greatly increased [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|tuition fees]] by the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative/Lib Dem (Cameron/Clegg) coalition government]]. Deferrals in 2016&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; were near their peak again although [http://www.yearoutgroup.org/what-is-a-gap-year/ Year Out Group] states its members now take more bookings from students outside the UK. Shorter gap style experiences (volunteering, expeditions, courses and work placements) are gaining in popularity, as they can be taken without the need to take a full year out of study or work.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===United States of America===
In the [[United States]], the practice of taking a "year off" remains the exception, but is gaining in popularity.&lt;ref name="Sara Castellanos"&gt;{{cite news

Taking a year off has recently become slightly more common for Americans, the main reasons are that students are feeling burnt out with schooling and want to take time to make sure their lives are headed in a direction that suits them.&lt;ref name="SUE SHELLENBARGER"&gt;{{cite news

Universities such as [[Georgetown University]], [[New York University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/admitted-students/deferring-admission.html |title=Deferring Your Enrollment |work=New York University}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amherst College]], [[Princeton University]], [[Harvard University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Middlebury College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.middlebury.edu/admissions/apply/decisions/gapyearinfo |title=Gap Year Information |work=Middlebury College |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Davidson College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.davidson.edu/admission-and-financial-aid/frequently-asked-questions |title=Frequently Asked Questions |work=Davidson College |accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yeshiva University]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Yeshiva University#Rankings|Yeshiva University Rankings]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Reed College]] have formal policies allowing students to defer admission.&lt;ref name="SUE SHELLENBARGER" /&gt;

[[Tufts University]] offers a program called 1+4 which allows students from lower income families to volunteer abroad or within America for a period of one year before starting their bachelor's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tufts 1+4 Bridge-Year Program |url=https://tischcollege.tufts.edu/education/tufts1plus4 |website=Tufts University |publisher=Trustees of Tufts College |accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naropa University&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naropa.edu|title=Home - Naropa University|website=www.naropa.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Boulder, Colorado, is the first U.S. university to fully integrate the gap year into a four-year undergraduate degree, which makes financial aid directly available to any student considering a gap year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naropa.edu/academics/bachelors/leap-year/index.php|title=LEAPYEAR - Naropa University|website=www.naropa.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some formal gap year programs can cost as much as $30,000, but cheaper alternatives are becoming more widely available; some reduce costs by offering room and board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/97065/gap-year-college | work=Time | first=Randye | last=Hoder | title=Why Your High School Senior Should Take a Gap Year | date=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/education/articles/2010/06/09/gap-year-program-profile-conservation-corps |title= Gap Year Program Profile: Conservation Corps |first=Rebecca |last=Kern |work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |date=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[National Civilian Community Corps]], an [[AmeriCorps]] program, offers 18-24 year olds (no age limit for Team Leaders) an all expense paid gap year (room &amp; board, meals, transportation, etc.) in exchange for a 10-month commitment to National and Community service.&lt;ref name="nationalservice.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalservice.gov/nccc |title=AmeriCorps NCCC |work=[[Corporation for National and Community Service]] |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; AmeriCorps NCCC members travel the country in diverse teams and perform a variety of tasks such as rebuilding trails in national parks, responding to natural disasters or working as mentors for disadvantaged youths.&lt;ref name="nationalservice.gov"/&gt; As with most AmeriCorps programs, service members receive an education award of approximately $6,000 upon completion of their service that can be used toward qualified educational expenses or student loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps/segal-americorps-education-award |title=Segal AmeriCorps Education Award |work=Corporation for National and Community Service |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zero cost to the member model AmeriCorps offers makes it an attractive alternative to costly gap year programs while leveraging taxpayer dollars to strengthen American communities.

Additionally, new federal partnerships such as [[FEMA Corps]] offer traditional gap year seekers an immersive professional and team building experience that can serve as a launch pad for their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalservice.gov/FEMACorps |title=FEMA Corps |work=Corporation for National and Community Service |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some government programs designed to help students afford college prohibit students from taking a gap year.  For example, the Tennessee Promise program requires that students must "Attend full-time and continuously at an eligible postsecondary institution as defined in T.C.A. § 49-4-708 in the fall term immediately following graduation or attainment of a GED or HiSET diploma; except that a student enrolling in a Tennessee College of Applied Technology (TCAT) may enroll in the summer prior to the fall term."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tennessee Promise Handbook |url=http://tennesseepromise.gov/files/TNPromiseHandbook080514.pdf |work=Tennessee Promise |accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malia Obama]], daughter of President Barack Obama, took a gap year before attending Harvard university in the fall of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=4&amp;sid=fe06e9af-28a3-4a35-a977-8aedae55650e%40sessionmgr104&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl|title=gap year gain|last=Barnds|first=kent|date=2018|website=ebsco|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universities such as Harvard and Princeton are encouraging students to take a Gap year.

===Venezuela===
In [[Venezuela]], students from elite schools generally do their undergraduate studies outside of Venezuela.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Gap years were unknown in Venezuela until educational consultant Nelson Agelvis, then counselor of the "Moral y Luces Herzl-Bialik Jewish school" in Caracas, insisted on having applicants to US colleges do them.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The students went to leadership courses in Israel, PG years at elite US schools, tutorial colleges in the UK, work internships, language centers across the globe, and exploration gap years in remote countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Today, the practice has become more widespread and Venezuela is a major economic contributor to the gap year. They are also major contributors in the college studies and English studies industries, especially in countries such as Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Venezuelan-students-flock-to-Ireland-and-cash-in-on-currency-controls.html |title=Venezuelan students flock to Ireland and cash in on currency controls |date=1 February 2014 |work=IrishCentral |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yemen===
In [[Yemen]], a defer year is mandatory between secondary school (high school) and [[university]]. Unless one attends a private university, they must wait one year after secondary school before applying to university. Until the nineties it was mandatory for male graduates to go to the army for one year, and to teach in a school or work in a hospital for female graduates (and for men who cannot attend the army for health reasons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yemen: Information on military service and treatment of deserters / draft evaders in Yemen |url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/54913a7f4.html |website=Refworld |publisher=Country of Origin Research and Information |accessdate=20 September 2018 |date=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A working group was convened in September 2014, following the 2014 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], by former IMU President [[Ingrid Daubechies]] and Chair [[Peter J. Olver]] of the IMU’s Committee on Electronic Information and Communication (CEIC). Currently{{when|date=November 2016}} the working group has eight members, namely:

* [[Bruno Buchberger]], [[Research Institute for Symbolic Computation|RISC]], Hagenberg/Linz, Austria
* [[Patrick Ion]], [[Mathematical Reviews]]/AMS, Ann Arbor, MI, US

==Background==
In the spring of 2014, the Committee on Planning a Global Library of the Mathematical Sciences released a comprehensive study entitled “Developing a 21st Century Global Library for Mathematics Research.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18619/developing-a-21st-century-global-library-for-mathematics-research|title=Developing a 21st Century Global Library for Mathematics Research|first=National Research|last=Council|date=18 March 2014|publisher=|doi=10.17226/18619}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report states in its Strategic Plan section, “There is a compelling argument that through a combination of machine learning methods and editorial effort by both paid and volunteer editors, a significant portion of the information and knowledge in the global mathematical corpus could be made available to researchers as [[linked open data]] through the GDML."

==Workshop==
A workshop titled "Semantic Representation of Mathematical Knowledge" was held at the [[Fields Institute]] in Toronto during February 3–5, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/15-16/semantic/|title=Fields Institute - Semantic Representation of Mathematical Knowledge Workshop|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframfoundation.org/programs/computable-archive-of-mathematics.html|title=Computable Archive of Mathematics: Wolfram Foundation Project (or Program)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the workshop was to lay down the foundations of a prototype semantic representation language for the GDML.  The workshop's organizers recognized that the extremely wide scope of mathematics as a whole made it unrealistic to map out the detailed concepts, structures, and operations needed and used in individual mathematical subjects.  The workshop therefore limited itself to surveys of the status quo in mathematical representation languages including representation of prominent and fundamental theorems in certain areas that could serve as building blocks for additional mathematical results, and to discussing ways to best identify and design semantic components for individual disciplines of mathematics.

The workshop organizers are presently{{when|date=November 2016}} preparing a report summarizing the workshop's conclusions and making recommendations for further progress towards a GDML.

'''Global Leadership Adventures''' ('''GLA''') offers high school [[study abroad]] programs where students engage in [[service-learning]] in [[Belize]], [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]] ([[Galápagos Islands]]), [[Fiji]], [[France]] ([[Guadeloupe]]), [[Ghana]], [[Guatemala]], [[Haiti]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]] ([[Bali]]), [[Peru]], [[Philippines]], [[South Africa]], [[Spain]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Thailand]].

Global Leadership Adventures was founded by [[Fred Swaniker]] as a precursor to the [[African Leadership Academy]], based in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]] but became a separate entity in 2004. The organization is currently based in [[San Diego]], United States. GLA is a certified [[benefit corporation]] (B-Corp).

In 2005 and again in 2008, GLA hosted [[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]] in South Africa to speak about the legacy of Apartheid.  In 2007, GLA students met with Costa Rican president and Nobel Peace Prize Winner [[Oscar Arias]] to discuss the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) which was to be voted upon in a national referendum in Costa Rica.

GLA has been featured by wide number of publications, including the ''[[New York Times]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[Teen Vogue]]'', and ''[[The Huffington Post]]''. GLA has a growing alumni base, with student alumni hailing from over 50 different countries.

As of July 2018, GDS has offered scholarships to 26 students in public universities in Kara and Lome (Togo), [[Bordeaux, France]] and in [[Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Grain de Sel Togo, Inc - Scholarship|url = http://graindeseltogo.org/actions-2/gds-scholarship|website = graindeseltogo.org/actions-2/gds-scholarship|access-date = 2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other students have been supported for the Master Studies in France.

== History ==

Inspired by the [[Fulbright Program]], founded in 1946 by the US Senator from [[Arkansas]] J. William Fulbright, who promulgated the Exchange Fulbright, considered to be one of the most prestigious scholarships programs in the world ;

In recognition of the efforts of the [[US State Department]] to ensure the quality and excellence of the [[Fulbright]] scholarship and affiliate programs;

Based on this prestigious model;

Convinced that supporting needy but also outstanding and motivated students in public universities will ensure the continuity of the culture of academic excellence and lead to a new form of leadership;

Believing that Africans themselves can also contribute to the promotion of education in Sub-Saharan countries, setting themselves as leadership role models;

A group of [[Fulbright]] Fellows from Togo, while studying in US universities, decided to create – on this  day of 27 July 2013 – a scholarship called Grain De Sel / Grain of Salt (GDS) to support needy students.

{{refimprove|date=July 2018}}
The '''head teacher''', '''headmaster''', '''headmistress''', '''head''', '''chancellor''', '''principal''' or '''school director''' (sometimes another title is used) is the staff member with the greatest responsibility for the [[management]] of a school, [[college]], or, in the case of the [[United States]] and [[India]], an independent school.

==Description==
In the past, the headmaster or headmistress of a British [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|private school]] was often the owner of the school or a member of the owning family, and the position often remained in the family for many generations.

In Scotland, the holder of this position is sometimes known as the "[[Rector (academia)|rector]]", most commonly in [[independent school (UK)|independent schools]]. In North America, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Ireland (including [[Northern Ireland]]), the position holder is usually known as the "school principal", but some schools, primarily independent schools, use the term "headmaster" or "head master". As in Scotland, the term "[[Rector (academia)|rector]]" is still in use in the United States in independent religious schools, as by tradition the Head of School was also a priest. Some American [[state school]]s, such as [[Boston Latin School]], [[Brooklyn Latin School]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} and [[Milpitas High School]],{{Citation needed|reason=The school web site uses the term principal.|date=December 2010}} also use the term "headmaster", either because of its history or historical connections.

In Britain, the terms "headmaster" and "headmistress" used to be the formal titles in most state schools as well as private schools, with "head teacher" only being used as a term to refer to them collectively. In recent years, however, most state schools have switched to the gender-neutral "head teacher" as the official title. Nevertheless, the gender-specific terms are still in common use and are still the official titles at some of the remaining state [[grammar school]]s and most private schools. Some use other terms, such as "high master". In South Africa, independent schools and, the majority of, state schools use the gender-specific terms "headmaster" and "headmistress" when addressing their head teachers. 

"Principal" or "Head of School" is often used as the title of the head administrator of an [[Primary school|elementary school]], [[middle school]], or [[high school]]  or [[boarding school]] in some English-speaking countries, including the United States, India, Australia and New Zealand. [[Public school (government funded)#United States|Public schools in the United States]] generally use the title "principal" whereas [[private school]]s in the United States sometimes use the title Head of School.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Role==
While some head teachers still do some teaching themselves, in most larger schools most of their duties are [[Management|managerial]] and [[pastoral care|pastoral]]. They are often used to discipline misbehaving students, help organize school sponsored activities, and all teachers in a school report to the head teacher. 

In Australia, the Head teacher is sometimes in charge of one (in the case of a major subject) or multiple (often in smaller schools) specific departments, such as English, History, Maths, Science, Writing, Technology, etc., but maintains full teaching duties and status. They are considered part of the school executive, and often a head teacher position is a stepping-stone into administration.

==Executive head==
{{Main|Executive head teacher}}

==Deputy head==
{{Main|Deputy head teacher}}

==Assistants==
In larger schools, the principal is assisted by one or more "[[vice-principal]]s", "[[assistant principal]]s", "associate principals", or "deputy principals".  Their position is secondary to the principal with regard to school governance. Assistant principals generally perform specific duties such as handling student discipline, curriculum, student council or student activities whereas the principal has the ultimate responsibility for the school as a whole (including faculty and staff, physical plant, etc.).

==Regional information==
=== Australia and New Zealand ===
In many Australian and New Zealand schools, a headmaster/principal is the head [[Academic administration|administrator]] of a school who has been appointed to her/his position by the [[school board]], superintendent, or other body. The principal, often in conjunction with the school board, makes the executive decisions that govern the school, as well as having the authority over the employment (and in some cases firing) of teachers. The principal is often the chief [[School discipline|disciplinarian]] of the students.

===United States===
{{outdated section|date=July 2014}}
In 1999, there were about 133,000 principals and assistant principals in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/2002130.pdf Digest of Education Statistics 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early decades of public education, the full title was "principal teacher", which accounts for the present day title having an adjectival form, essentially being a foreshortened version of the original full title. Yet the term Headmaster and Head of School is still used in some older schools. School principals in the United States are expected to have school administrator licensure, and, often, a master's degree in educational administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Schools Offering Education Administration Degrees|url=https://www.elearners.com/online-degrees/education/administration-leadership/|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kate Rousmaniere, ''The Principal's Office: A Social History of the American School Principal'' (State University of New York Press; 2013) 197 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of school leaders==
While there has been considerable anecdotal discussion about the importance of school leaders, there has been very little systematic research into their impact on student outcomes. Recent analysis in the United States has examined how the gains in student achievement at a school change after the principal changes. This outcome-based approach to measuring effectiveness of principals is very similar to the [[value-added modeling]] that has been applied to the evaluation of teachers. Such research in the state of Texas found that principals have a very large impact on student achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Branch, [[Eric Hanushek]], and Steven G. Rivkin, "School Leaders Matter: Measuring the impact of effective principals," ‘’Education Next’’ 13(1), Winter 2013.[http://educationnext.org/school-leaders-matter/]&lt;/ref&gt; Effective school leaders have been shown to significantly improve the performance of all students at the school, at least in part through their impacts on selection and retention of good teachers. Ineffective principals have a similarly large negative effect on school performance, suggesting that issues of evaluation are as important for school administrators as they are for teachers. The impact of principals has also been measured in non-traditional ways.{{clarifyme|date=September 2016}} Some principals have focused their efforts on creating more inclusive schools for students with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;DeMatthews, D. E., &amp; Mawhinney, H. B. (2014).  Social Justice Leadership and Inclusion: Exploring Challenges in an Urban District Struggling to Address Inequities.

The '''{{nihongo|Imperial Rescript on Education|教育に関する勅語|Kyōiku ni Kansuru Chokugo}}''' was signed by [[Emperor Meiji]] of Japan on 30 October 1890 to articulate government policy on the guiding principles of education on the [[Empire of Japan]]. The 315 [[kanji|character]] document was read aloud at all important school events, and students were required to study and memorize the text.

==Background==
Following the [[Meiji Restoration]], the leadership of the [[government of Meiji Japan|Meiji government]] felt the need to emphasize the common goals of rapid modernization (westernization) with support and legitimization of the political system centered on the imperial institution. In the 1870s and 1880s, [[Motoda Nagazane]] and other conservatives pushed for a revival of the principles of [[Confucianism]] as a guide for education and [[public morality]]; however, [[Inoue Kowashi]] and other proponents of the 'modernization' of Japan felt that this would encourage a return to the old feudal order, and pushed for an "emperor-centered" philosophy.  [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Yamagata Aritomo]] authorized the drafting of the Rescript, which was a compromise written largely by Inoue Kowashi with input from Motoda Nagazane and others.

After it was issued, the Rescript was distributed to all schools in the country, together with a [[portrait#Politics|portrait]] of [[Emperor Meiji]].

==Details==
The Rescript requested of the people that they "furthermore advance public good and promote common interests; always respect the [[Meiji Constitution|Constitution]] and observe the laws; should emergency arise, offer yourselves courageously to the State; and thus guard and maintain the prosperity of Our Imperial Throne coeval with heaven and earth".

The basis of the Rescript was that Japan's unique ''[[kokutai]]'' (system of government) was based on a historic bond between benevolent rulers and loyal subjects, and that the fundamental purpose of education was to cultivate virtues, especially loyalty and [[filial piety]].

After the [[end of World War II in Asia]] following the [[surrender of Japan]], the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|American occupation authorities]] forbade the formal reading of the Imperial Rescript in schools, and the [[National Diet]] officially abolished it on 19 June 1948.

==Kikuchi Dairoku and the Imperial Rescript on Education==
In 1907, [[Kikuchi Dairoku]] was invited by the [[University of London]] to give lectures on education from the middle of February for about five months. The central focus of his lectures was the Imperial Rescript on Education. The request for the lectures was initially communicated to [[Hayashi Tadasu]], then ambassador in [[London]] (from December 1905). At first [[Sawayanagi Matsutaro]] was to give the lectures, but he was recalled when in [[Rome]] on the way to London and Kikuchi gave the lectures instead. As a preparation for the lectures he translated the Imperial Rescript into English.

'''Javier Perez-Capdevila''' is a distinguished [[Cuba]]n scientist, internationally renowned applying mathematics to environmental management, knowledge management, economics and accounting, among other fields of science and life.
He is Senior Advisor to the Science, Technology and Environment Ministry; Guantanamo Delegation, Cuba, and Full Professor in University of Guantanamo.

== Biographical synthesis ==
He was born on February 7, 1963, in [[Guantanamo]], capital of the province. He accomplished all his studies up to the [[university]] level as a student in his natal province, graduated at the Institute of Pedagogical Sciences as a bachelor in Education in the Mathematics specialty, in 1985; he was the first and only student up to that time ever obtaining all the prizes awarded in a graduation. That way, he graduated in sports and culture, in teaching practice, as best assistant pupil, as an undergraduate instructor and of course as the most integral graduate. He received his diploma of hands of the President of Cuba Republic [[Fidel Castro Ruz]], in an act held in Havana, at the [[Karl Marx]]  theater in June 1985, in occasion of the First Graduation in Education in the Primary Teachers specialty, attended by relevant students of other specialties.&lt;ref name="uno"/&gt;

His work experience now counts more than 30 years, since he was as a pupil assistant  teacher and undergraduate instructor. He has worked as university professor, executive in education, mathematician in the Unit of Analysis and Tendencies in Health and specialist for the control of the scientific activity and technology of the Ministry of [[Science]], [[Technology]] and the Environment (CITMA), where he directs nowadays the Science and Technology Unit, in addition, he keeps his links with the university, where he has taught pre-grade courses, master´s and doctorate´s lectures. 
Being very young, a university student, he stood out at the scientific investigation's field, obtaining multiple awards and mentions at provincial and national spaces.

== Main scientific contributions ==
He has introduced several concepts in [[fuzzy mathematics]] and he has exemplified in a creative way its practical application, including: 
* Fuzzy harmonious sets&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt;
* Fuzzy related sets&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt;
* Fuzzy transmuting sets&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt; 
* Transmutation of a [[fuzzy set]]&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt;
* Fuzzy transmuted set&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt;
* Synthetic value of the elements of the fuzzy set E in correspondence with the fuzzy transmutational set O&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt;
* A theorem that demonstrates the marginal value of that synthetic value&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt;
* Overweight in the adjustment&lt;ref name="tres"/&gt;
* Coefficient for equal adjustment&lt;ref name="tres"/&gt;

He has also created two theories which have demonstrated applicability in practice: 
* A theory of adequation fuzzy sets with tie-breaker&lt;ref name="tres"/&gt;
* Theory of mixture of fuzzy sets&lt;ref name="cuatro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cinco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seis"/&gt;

The mixture of fuzzy sets, an operation between fuzzy sets where for the first time in worldwide mathematics was demonstrated an operation with the elements of the sets turning them into new elements. It is a new thing in mathematics, and it has universal validity.&lt;ref name="seis1"/&gt;

He demonstrated the value of diagnosis of his theory in the evaluation of work and professional competences in his first presentation, and he proved the prospective value of the mixture of fuzzy sets, demonstrating how and up to what point the natural, the technological and the human capitals can generate products.

In the field of applied mathematics he has achieved important advances regarding the evaluation of the economical effects and control of the exotic invading alien species, and he has accomplished important theoretical contributions. He has contributed to the concepts of individual benefit of an exotic invading alien species, collective benefit of an exotic invading alien species, a priori cost-benefit analysis of an exotic invading alien species, a posteriori cost-benefit analysis of an exotic invading alien species, as well as a method to accomplish those analyses.&lt;ref name="siete"/&gt;

He has also accomplished significant theoretical contributions to the applied mathematics's field at the entrepreneurial Management level, emphasizing in the precise and measurable concept of work competences;&lt;ref name="ocho"/&gt; he has also introduced the concept of maps of work competences,&lt;ref name="nueve"/&gt; a people's classification on the base of the map of work competences; he created a method to evaluate and measure the work competences taking as a starting point the human perception and constructing their map for decisión taking inside the organization.&lt;ref name="diez"/&gt;

He created a method to determine the relationship between work competences and salaries,&lt;ref name="once"/&gt; which evaluates the losses that can be generated due to the lack of competences (whether laboral or professional ). In the same way he constructed a simulating device to relate competences with productivity of the work and quality of work.

He designed a fuzzy mathematical method for the SWOT analysis, that surpasses all the limitations of the previous methods, achieving entrepreneurial precise diagnosises for strategic planning.&lt;ref name="doce"/&gt;

== Publications ==
He has published over 30 scientific papers in reviewed Cuban and foreign magazines, and also the books: 
* References for an analysis of the Sustainable Development, in June 2013. Spain. ( in collaboration with a team of Spanish and Cuban authors)
* Science and technology from a popular point of view, in February 2011. Editorial Academia. Havana.&lt;ref name="trece"/&gt;

'''John E. Penick''' is an American professor of [[science education]] who has taught in high schools, community college, and at several universities in the United States and abroad. Author of more than 200 articles in professional journals and 40 books and monographs, Penick is best known for promoting innovative programs and processes for enhancing undergraduate teacher education.&lt;ref&gt;Yager, R. E. and Penick, J. E. (1990). Science education. Chapter 36 of Houston, R. E. (Ed.) Handbook of Research on Teacher Education&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiiBmQ0bQGg |title=IT'S ABOUT TIME® Interviews Dr. John Penick at NSTA 2014 |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-04-11 |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his innovations were based on his studies of exemplary teachers in the United States, studies that focused on determining the roles of effective teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Penick, J. E., Yager, R. E., and Bonnstetter, R. (October, 1986). Teachers make exemplary programs. Educational Leadership, 44(2), 14-20&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his work with undergraduates, Penick has conducted workshops and presentations for teachers in almost every state of the U.S., speaking about and demonstrating how research can inform teacher practice and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Penick, J.E. and Harris, R.L. (2005). Teaching with Purpose. Arlington VA: NSTA Press. 66 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Widening his scope, Penick has worked extensively with a variety of international universities, ministries of education, and organizations in 35 countries.

==Education==
Penick received his B.S. in zoology and chemistry (1966) and his M.A. in biology education (1969) from the [[University of Miami]].  He received his Ph.D. in Science Education from [[The Florida State University]] in 1973. At Florida State he was mentored by Professor Dorothy M. Schlitt, known for her innovative ideas related to science teacher education. At Florida State, Penick was also significantly influenced by Professors Charles Matthews and Ron Good. While at Florida State Penick met fellow student [[James A. Shymansky]], with whom he would continue to work for many years.

==Professional career==
Following his graduation in 1973, Penick became assistant professor at [[Loyola University of Chicago]], where he taught and was Director of Teacher Education in his second year. In 1975 Penick left Loyola for the [[University of Iowa]], where his classmate, [[James A. Shymansky]], had been for two years. At Iowa, Penick was promoted to Associate Professor (1977) and Professor (1982) and eventually was named Department Chair (1982).  While at Iowa, Penick worked closely with Vincent Lunetta in developing and expanding a preservice science teacher education program, initially funded by the [[National Science Foundation]], called Iowa UPSTEP.&lt;ref&gt;Penick, J. E. and Lunetta, V. N. (Autumn, 1980). Iowa-UPSTEP: A dynamic model in science teacher education now. The Teacher Educator, 16(1), 14-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penick, J. E. and Yager, R. E. (Nov–Dec, 1988) Science teacher education: A program with a theoretical and pragmatic rationale. Journal of Teacher Education, 39(6), 59–64&lt;/ref&gt; During Penick’s years at the University of Iowa, the department of science education was noted as being large, dynamic, and highly productive of scholarly publications and outstanding students at every level. In 1985 he was a senior [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] Scholar at the [[University of Lisbon]] (Portugal) and [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|The Technion]] ([[Haifa|Haifa, Israel]]).

After more than 22 years at the University of Iowa, Penick was named Head of the Department of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education at [[North Carolina State University]]. As Department Head, Penick emphasized research productivity and hired a number of new faculty members. During his more than 10 years as Head, the value of grants obtained by his department grew significantly and his department grew in research productivity.

Following his retirement from NC State in 2009, Penick accepted a position as Director for Research and Development at [[Sangari do Brasil]], in Sao Paulo Brazil. With the creation of Sangari USA, Penick became vice president for research and development of the American subsidiary. He retired from Sangari in 2011 and currently resides in Miami Florida.

==Honors and offices==

[[Epsilon Pi Tau]], the national honorary for technology education presented Penick with a Distinguished Service Citation in 2003 for his contributions to technology education.  In 1987 and again in 2015, the [[Florida State University College of Education]] presented him with the Distinguished Educator award, its highest award, for his contributions to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.fsu.edu/alumni-and-friends/distinguished-alumni/past-recipients |title=Past Recipients &amp;#124; College of Education - FSU |website=Education.fsu.edu |date=2015-11-10 |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=) |url=http://fsuednews.com/2015/10/19/fsu-college-of-education-names-2015-distinguished-alumni-award-winners/ |title=FSU College of Education names 2015 Distinguished Alumni Award winners |website=FSU EdNews |date=2015-10-19 |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born while his father, Edgar C. Penick Jr., was stationed at Langley Virginia during WW II,  young John lived in Austin Texas prior to his family moving to Miami Florida in 1947, where, like many others, he dreamed of being the undersea explorer, Jacques Cousteau. After earning his B.S., Penick finished a year of graduate work there in Zoology before becoming a high school biology and chemistry teacher at [[Miami Jackson High School|Miami Jackson Senior High School]]. After his masters degree, Penick taught one summer at [[Miami Dade College|Miami-Dade Community College]] before being named department head at Miami Jackson. During the 1972-73 school year, he taught  high school biology at the Florida State University lab school, with Professor Dorothy Schlitt, Sharyl Bender, and Judy Lewis . A 1978 article describes the innovations they implemented during that experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Student-structured learning in biology.|last = Penick, J.

==Family==
Penick married his high school sweetheart, Nell Inman in 1966 and, after she taught English at Jackson High School for three years, they had two children, Lucas (1969) and Megan (1973).  Nell Inman Penick received her Ph.D. in Counseling and Human Development from the University of Iowa in 1990 and had a private practice for [[marriage and family therapy]] for 20 years in Iowa and North Carolina, Lucas is a private teacher and tutor, primarily in science and mathematics, in Miami and Megan is an attorney in New York City. Megan, with her husband, Yong Jae Lee, has given her parents three grandchildren, Juliet Lee (2006), Renee Lee (2008), and Lia Lee (2010).

==Life and work==
Albers was born into a Roman Catholic family of [[Artisan|craftsmen]] in [[Bottrop]], [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]], [[German Empire|Germany]].&lt;ref name="Making of a Bauhaus Master"&gt;Roderick Conway Morris (October 21, 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/arts/22iht-Conway22.html Making of a Bauhaus Master] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked from 1908 to 1913 as a schoolteacher in his home town; he also trained as an art teacher at Königliche Kunstschule in Berlin, Germany, from 1913 to 1915. From 1916 to 1919 he began his work as a printmaker at the Kunstgewerbschule in Essen. In 1918 he received his first public commission, ''Rosa mystica ora pro nobis'', a [[stained-glass window]] for a church in Essen.&lt;ref name="Making of a Bauhaus Master"/&gt; In 1919 he went to Munich, Germany, to study at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Königliche Bayerische Akademie der Bildenden Kunst]], where he was a pupil of [[Max Doerner (artist)|Max Doerner]] and [[Franz Stuck]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://collection.crystalbridges.org:8080/emuseum/view/people/asitem/Objects$0040678/0?t:state:flow=a310d5c7-d3ad-4fe4-96ca-0c28777176ba Josef Albers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104164821/http://collection.crystalbridges.org:8080/emuseum/view/people/asitem/Objects$0040678/0?t:state:flow=a310d5c7-d3ad-4fe4-96ca-0c28777176ba |date=2013-11-04 }} [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]], Bentonville.&lt;/ref&gt;

Albers enrolled as a student in the preliminary course (Vorkurs) of [[Johannes Itten]] at the [[Weimar]] [[Bauhaus]] in 1920. Although Albers had studied [[painting]], it was as a maker of stained glass that he joined the faculty of the Bauhaus in 1922, approaching his chosen medium as a component of [[architecture]] and as a stand-alone art form.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[[Holland Cotter]] (July 26, 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/27/arts/design/josef-albers-in-america-painting-on-paper-at-the-morgan.html Harmony, Harder Than It Looks – ‘Josef Albers in America: Painting on Paper,’ at the Morgan] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The director and founder of the Bauhaus, [[Walter Gropius]], asked him in 1923 to teach in the preliminary course 'Werklehre' of the department of design to introduce newcomers to the principles of [[handicrafts]], because Albers came from that background and had appropriate practice and knowledge.

In 1925, Albers was promoted to professor, the year the Bauhaus moved to [[Dessau]]. At this time, he married [[Anni Albers]] (née Fleischmann) who was a student there. His work in [[Dessau#The Bauhaus|Dessau]] included designing [[furniture]] and working with [[glass]]. As a younger art teacher, he was teaching at the Bauhaus among artists who included [[Oskar Schlemmer]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and [[Paul Klee]]. The so-called form master, Klee taught the formal aspects in the glass workshops where Albers was the crafts master; they cooperated for several years.

With the closure of the Bauhaus under [[Nazism|Nazi]] pressure in 1933 the artists dispersed, most leaving the country. Albers emigrated to the United States. The architect [[Philip Johnson]], then a curator at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City|New York]], arranged for Albers to be offered a job as head of a new art school, [[Black Mountain College]], in [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;Pepe Carmel (June 25, 1995), [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/25/arts/art-view-a-modern-master-of-bottles-scraps-and-squares.html A Modern Master of Bottles, Scraps and Squares] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1933, he joined the faculty of the college where he was the head of the painting program until 1949.

At Black Mountain, his students included [[Ruth Asawa]], [[Ray Johnson]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Cy Twombly]], and [[Susan Weil]]. He also invited important American artists such as [[Willem de Kooning]], to teach in the summer seminar. Weil remarked that, as a teacher, Albers was "his own academy". She said that Albers claimed that "when you're in school, you're not an artist, you're a student", although he was very supportive of self-expression when one became an artist and began on her or his journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Susan Weil |author=Robert Ayers |publisher=ARTINFO |date=March 29, 2006 |url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/16817/susan-weil/ |accessdate=2008-04-22 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308024926/http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/16817/susan-weil/ |archivedate=March 8, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Albers produced many [[woodcut]]s and leaf studies at this time.

In 1950, Albers left Black Mountain to head the department of design at [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. While at Yale, Albers worked to expand the nascent [[graphic design]] program (then called "[[graphic arts]]"), hiring designers [[Alvin Eisenman]], [[Herbert Matter]], and [[Alvin Lustig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Origins: Yale years | author= Rob Roy Kelly | date= June 23, 1989 | url=http://www.rit.edu/library/archives/rkelly/html/01_ori/ori_yal2.html | accessdate=2010-02-09 | postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Albers worked at Yale until he retired from teaching in 1958.

In 1962, as a [[fellow]] at Yale, he received a grant from the Graham Foundation for the Advanced Studies of Fine Arts for an exhibit and lecture on his work. Albers also collaborated with Yale professor and architect [[King-lui Wu]] in creating decorative designs for some of Wu's projects. Among these were distinctive geometric [[fireplaces]] for the Rouse (1954) and DuPont (1959) houses, the façade of [[Manuscript Society]], one of Yale's secret senior groups (1962), and a design for the Mt. Bethel Baptist Church (1973). Also, at this time he worked on his structural constellation pieces.

In 1963, he published ''[[Interaction of Color]]'' which presented his [[theory]] that [[colors]] were governed by an internal and deceptive logic. The very rare first edition has a limited printing of only 2,000 copies and contained 150 [[silk screen]] plates.  This work has been republished since and is now even available as a [[cell phone app]].  Also during this time, he created the abstract [[album covers]] of band leader [[Enoch Light]]'s [[Command LP]] records. His album cover for Terry Snyder and the All Stars 1959 album, ''Persuasive Percussion'', shows a tightly packed grid or lattice of small black disks from which a few wander up and out as if stray molecules of some light gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Masheck|first=Joseph|title=ALBERS' RECORD JACKETS: Doing an Artful Job|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=December 2009 – January 2010|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2009/12/artseen/albers-record-jackets-doing-an-artful-job}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1973.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albers continued to paint and write, staying in New Haven with his wife, [[textile]] artist, [[Anni Albers]], until his death in 1976.

===''Homage to the Square''===
Accomplished as a [[designer]], [[photographer]], [[typographer]], [[printmaker]], and [[poet]], Albers is best remembered for his work as an [[abstract art|abstract]] [[painter]] and [[theorist]]. He favored a very disciplined approach to [[composition (visual arts)|composition]]. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series, ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored [[Chromaticity|chromatic interactions]] with nested squares. Usually painting on [[Masonite]], he used a [[palette knife]] with oil colors and often recorded the colors he used on the back of his works. Each painting consists of either three or four squares of solid planes of color nested within one another, in one of four different arrangements and in square formats ranging from 406×406&amp;nbsp;mm to 1.22×1.22 m.&lt;ref name="Josef Albers"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=97 Josef Albers] [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[Manhattan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murals===
[[File:Albers "Wrestling" (1977).jpg|thumb|Albers "Wrestling" (1977) in [[Sydney]]]]
In 1959, a [[gold-leaf]] [[mural]] by Albers, ''Two Structural Constellations'' was engraved in the lobby of the [[Corning Glass|Corning Glass Building]] in [[Manhattan]]. For the entrance of the [[Time-Life Building|Time &amp; Life Building]] lobby, he created ''Two Portals'' (1961), a 42-feet by 14-feet mural of alternating glass bands in white and brown that recede into two [[bronze]] centers to create an illusion of depth.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Dunlap (June 17, 2002), [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/17/nyregion/press-l-for-landmark-time-life-lobby-a-50-s-gem-awaits-recognition.html Press 'L' for Landmark; Time &amp; Life Lobby, a 50's Gem, Awaits Recognition] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s [[Walter Gropius]], who was designing the [[Pan Am Building]] with [[Emery Roth|Emery Roth &amp; Sons]] and [[Pietro Belluschi]], commissioned Albers to make a mural. The artist reworked ''City'', a [[sand blasting|sandblasted]] glass construction that he had designed in 1929 at the Bauhaus, and renamed it ''Manhattan''. The giant abstract mural of black, white, and red strips arranged in interwoven columns stood 28-feet high and 55-feet wide and was installed in the lobby of the building; it was removed during a lobby redesign in c. 2000. Before his death in 1976 Albers left exact specifications of the work so it could easily be replicated.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (July 9, 2001), [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/09/arts/a-familiar-mural-finds-itself-without-a-wall.html A Familiar Mural Finds Itself Without a Wall] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, his painted mural ''Growth'' (1965) as well as ''Loggia Wall'' (1965), a [[brick]] [[relief]], were installed on the campus of the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]. Other architectural works include ''Gemini'' (1972), a [[stainless steel]] relief for the Grand Avenue National Bank lobby in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and ''Reclining Figure'' (1972), a [[mosaic]] mural for the [[Exxon Building (New York)|Celanese Building]] in Manhattan destroyed in 1980. At the invitation of a former student, the architect [[Harry Seidler]], Albers designed the mural ''Wrestling'' (1976) for  Seidler's Mutual Life Center in [[Sydney]], Australia.

==Style and influences==
He was known to meticulously list the specific manufacturer's colours and [[varnishes]] he used on the back of his works, as if the colours were catalogued components of an optical experiment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130205190440/http://www.waddingtoncustot.com/exhibition/albers2007/text/ Josef Albers: February 28 — March 27, 2007] Waddington Custot Galleries, London.&lt;/ref&gt; His work represents a transition between traditional European art and the new American art.&lt;ref name=p469&gt;Piper, David. ''The Illustrated History of Art'', {{ISBN|0-7537-0179-0}}, p469.&lt;/ref&gt; It incorporated European influences from the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivists]] and the [[Bauhaus]] movement, and its intensity and smallness of scale were typically European,&lt;ref name=p469/&gt; but his influence fell heavily on American artists of the late 1950s and the 1960s.&lt;ref name=p469/&gt; "[[Hard-edge painting|Hard-edge]]" abstract painters drew on his use of [[patterns]] and intense colors,&lt;ref&gt;Piper, David. ''The Illustrated History of Art'', {{ISBN|0-7537-0179-0}}, p470.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Op Art|Op]] artists and [[conceptual art]]ists further explored his interest in [[perception]].&lt;ref name=p469/&gt;

In an article about the artist, published in 1950, [[Elaine de Kooning]] concluded that however impersonal his paintings might at first appear, not one of them "could have been painted by any one but Josef Albers himself."&lt;ref name="Making of a Bauhaus Master"/&gt; Although their relationship was often tense, and sometimes, even combative, [[Robert Rauschenberg]] later identified Albers as his most important teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Knight (May 14, 2008), [http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/14/local/me-rauschenberg14 Robert Rauschenberg, 1925 – 2008: He led the way to Pop Art] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes of the artist==
: - "Every perception of colour is an illusion..  ..we do not see colors as they really are. In our perception they alter one another."&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Josef_Albers&lt;/ref&gt; [c. 1949, when Albers started his first '[[Homage to the Square]]' paintings]
: - "THE ORIGIN OF ART: The discrepancy between physical fact and psychic effect. THE CONTENT OF ART: Visual information of our reaction to life. THE MEASURE OF ART: The ratio of effort to effect. THE AIM OF ART: Revelation and evocation of vision."&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Josef_Albers#'Homage_to_the_square'_(1964)&lt;/ref&gt; [1964, from his text 'Homage to the square']
: - "For me, [[Abstract art|abstraction]] is real, probably more real than nature. I'll go further and say that abstraction is nearer my heart. I prefer to see with closed eyes."&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Josef_Albers&lt;/ref&gt; [1966]
: - "Art is not to be looked at. Art is looking at us..  .To be able to perceive it we need to be receptive. Therefore art is there where art meets us now. The content of art is visual formulation of our relation to life. The measure of art, the ratio of effort to effect, the aim of art revelation and evocation of vision.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aaa.si.edu/download_pdf_transcript/ajax?record_id=edanmdm-AAADCD_oh_214202&lt;/ref&gt; [1968, in 'Oral history interview with Josef Albers]
: - "I made true the first English sentence [Albers came from Germany] that I uttered (better stuttered) on our arrival at [[Black Mountain College]] in November 1933.

And this has become the motto of all my teaching."&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Josef_Albers#'A_conversation_with_Josef_Albers'_(1970)&lt;/ref&gt; [1970, in 'A conversation with Josef Albers']

A major Albers exhibition, organized by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], traveled in South America, Mexico, and the United States from 1965 to 1967.&lt;ref name="guggenheim.org"/&gt; In 1971 he was the first living artist to be given a solo show at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in Manhattan.&lt;ref name="Josef Albers"/&gt; In 2010, a show of 80 oil works on paper, many never exhibited before, was mounted by the [[Pinakothek der Moderne]] in [[Munich]], later travelling to other venues, including [[Centre Pompidou]] in [[Paris]], and [[The Morgan Library &amp; Museum]] in Manhattan.  In 2014, an exhibition at the Elliott Museum in Stuart, FL called "Albers and Heirs" featured the work of Albers, [[Neil Welliver]], and [[Jane Davis Doggett]].&lt;ref name="Art Daily"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martincountytimes.com"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The Josef Albers papers, documents from 1929 to 1970, were donated by the artist to the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Archives of American Art]] in 1969 and 1970. In 1971 (nearly five years before his death), Albers founded the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albersfoundation.org/Home.php The Josef and Anni Albers Foundation website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708183217/http://www.albersfoundation.org/Home.php |date=July 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit organization he hoped would further "the revelation and evocation of vision through art." Today, this organization not only serves as the office for the estates of both Josef Albers and his wife [[Anni Albers]], but also supports exhibitions and [[publications]] focused on the works of both Albers. The official foundation building is located in [[Bethany, Connecticut]], and "includes a central research and archival storage center to accommodate the Foundation's art collections, library and archives, and offices, as well as residence studios for visiting artists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albersfoundation.org/Foundation.php?inc=Mission The Josef and Anni Albers Foundation: Mission Statement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080715232841/http://www.albersfoundation.org/Foundation.php?inc=Mission |date=July 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The executive director of the foundation is [[Nicholas Fox Weber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/author/results.pperl?authorid=32648 |title=randomhouse.com |publisher=randomhouse.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the foundation was instrumental in having four [[forgery|fakes]] from Italy, represented as the work of Albers and on sale in auction houses and galleries in France and Germany, seized by the police.&lt;ref name="Making of a Bauhaus Master"/&gt;

In 1997, one year after the auction house, [[Sotheby's]], had bought the [[André Emmerich|Andre Emmerich Gallery]], the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation, the main beneficiary of the [[estate (law)|estates]] of both artists, did not renew its three-year contract with the gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (October 3, 1997), [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/03/arts/inside-art-sotheby-s-loses-albers-estate.html Sotheby's Loses Albers Estate] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the foundation is represented by [[David Zwirner]] in New York,&lt;ref&gt;David Zwirner (May 20, 2016) [http://www.davidzwirner.com/artists/josef-albers/biography/ "The Josef And Anni Albers Foundation Is Now Exclusively Represented by David Zwirner."] David Zwirner Gallery. (Retrieved 12-1-2016.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Waddington Custot Galleries]] in London, and the [[Alan Cristea Gallery]] in London, and now, a large part of his estate is held by the [[Josef Albers Museum]] in Bottrop, Germany, where he was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondationbeyeler.ch/en/collection/josef-albers Josef Albers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623135054/http://www.fondationbeyeler.ch/en/collection/josef-albers |date=2012-06-23 }} [[Fondation Beyeler]], Riehen.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Joseph Albers' book "Interaction of Color" is widely influential but, according to Alan Lee, has not received close critical attention. Lee undertakes to refute Albers' general claims about colour experience (that colour deceives continually) and to show that Albers' system of perceptual education is fundamentally misleading (Albers 'places practice before theory'). Four topics in Albers' account of colour are examined critically: additive and subtractive colour mixture, the tonal relations of colours, the [[Weber-Fechner Law]] and simultaneous contrast. In each case Albers is shown to have made fundamental errors with serious consequences for his general claims about colour and his pedagogical method. It is suggested that Albers' belief in the importance of colour deception is related to a misconception about aesthetic appreciation (that it depends upon some kind of confusion about visual perception). It is suggested that the scientific colour hypothesis of [[Edwin H. Land]] should be considered in lieu of the concepts held by Albers. Finally, there are implications for a reassessment of Albers' artworks that might follow a loss of faith in his colour concepts that seem to have been their foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Alan. "A Critical Account of Some of Josef Albers' Concepts of Color." Leonardo (1981): 99–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Value on the art market==
Several paintings in his series "Homage to the Square" have outsold their estimates. ''Homage to the Square: Joy'' (1964) sold for $1.5 million, nearly double its estimate, during a 2007 sale at Sotheby's.&lt;ref&gt;J.S. Marcus (December 18, 2010), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704694004576019500817814960 Re-Examining a Famed Teacher] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, "Study for Homage to the Square,R-III E.B." also sold for around twice the estimated $545,000–$700,000, eventually reaching $1.22 million at auction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.artsy.net/artist/josef-albers/auction-result/55069597776f727a7b430000]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aksel Leonard "Lenna" Åström''' (7 March 1883 [[Oulu]] – 16 May 1939 [[Brussels]], Belgium) was a Finnish diplomat.

Åström's parents were my sea captain Axel Mikael Åström and Maria Åström. She graduated from the Oulu Swedish Lyceum in 1902 and studied at the [[University of Helsinki]] completing [[Bachelor of Philosophy]] in 1909 and Mastering in 1910.

Åström was a journalist and shareholder of the Oulu newspaper [[Kaleva (newspaper)|''Kaleva'']] in 1904–1906, as a teacher at the Business College in [[Kotka]] in 1910–1916 and in [[Tampere]] in 1916–1917, and as a representative of the Tampere [[Chamber of commerce]] in 1918.

He served as the Senior Inspector of Trade and Industrial Governance in 1919 and the Trade Policy Department of the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)|Foreign Ministry]] 1919–1921. This was followed by Åström as Envoy in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], 1921–1934 and also as Envoy to [[Havana]] from 1929 to 1934. Åström was an Envoy in [[The Hague]] and Brussels from 1938 to 1939.

'''Leroy Lansing Janes''' (1838–1909) was an American [[educator]], [[o-yatoi gaikokujin|hired]] by [[Kumamoto Domain]] in early [[Meiji period]] [[Empire of Japan|Japan]].

A native of [[Ohio]], Janes was a veteran of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], where he served in the [[artillery]] with the rank of captain after graduation from the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]]. In 1871, he was approached by the [[Hosokawa clan]], feudal lords of [[Kumamoto, Kumamoto|Kumamoto]] to teach at the ''Kumamoto Yōgakkō'', a domainal school that promoted [[rangaku|western studies]]. Janes established a curriculum entirely in English, covering [[mathematics]], [[history]], [[geography]] and [[natural science]]s.  Janes lectured on western morals, and waited for three years to broach the subject of Christianity with his students, when he felt that he had gained their trust and that their English abilities were sufficient to understand the relationship between Christianity and [[western civilization]].

Some 30 of his pupils converted to Christianity under his influence, including [[Kozaki Hiromichi]], [[Ebina Danjō]], and [[Ukita Kazutami]]. The ''Kumamoto Yōgakkō'' was forced to close in August 1876 due to opposition from conservative elements within Kumamoto domain, and Janes, together with his students, relocated to [[Kyoto]], where they joined the [[Dōshisha University|Dōshisha school]], which had been founded a year earlier by [[Niijima Jō]]. Janes returned to the United States in 1878.

Janes returned to Japan to teach again from 1893 to 1899 as an ''[[oyatoi gaikokujin]]''.

'''Lewis Madison Terman'''  (January 15, 1877 – December 21, 1956) was an American psychologist and author. He was noted as a pioneer in [[educational psychology]] in the early 20th century at the [[Stanford Graduate School of Education]]. He is best known for his revision of the [[Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales]] and for initiating the longitudinal study of children with high IQs called the [[Genetic Studies of Genius]].&lt;ref&gt;Sears, R. R. (1957). L. M. Terman, pioneer in mental measurement. ''Science, 125'', 978-979. doi:10.1126/science.125.3255.978&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a prominent [[eugenics|eugenicist]] and was a member of the [[Human Betterment Foundation]].  He also served as president of the American Psychological Association. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, ranked Terman as the 72nd most cited psychologist of the 20th century, in a tie with [[G. Stanley Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haggbloom |first=Steven J. |last2=''et al.'' |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell |first9=John L., III| displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Terman was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, the son of Martha P. (Cutsinger) and James William Terman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=9LuaAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA419&amp;dq=Martha+Cutsinger+Terman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix7pHC1pfaAhXs6oMKHSwjAMwQ6AEIFDAA]&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Bachelor of Science|BS]], BPd (Bachelor of Pedagogy), and [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from [[Central Normal College]] in 1894 and 1898, and a BA and [[Master of Arts|MA]] from the [[Indiana University Bloomington]] in 1903. He received his [[Ph.D.|PhD]] from [[Clark University]] in 1905.

He worked as a [[school principal]] in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], [[California]] in 1905, and as a [[professor]] at [[Los Angeles Normal School]] in 1907. In 1910, he joined the faculty of [[Stanford University]] as a professor of [[educational psychology]] at the invitation of [[Ellwood Patterson Cubberley]] and remained associated with the university until his death. He served as [[chairman]] of the psychology department from 1922 to 1945.

His son, [[Frederick Terman]], is widely credited (together with [[William Shockley]]) with being the father of [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paloaltohistory.com/stanfordresearchpark.html Palo Alto History Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116012546/http://www.paloaltohistory.com/stanfordresearchpark.html |date=2010-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievements ==
=== IQ testing ===
Terman published the ''Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon Scale'' in 1916 and revisions were released in 1937 and 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0848220.html|title=Terman, Lewis Madison - Infoplease.com|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Original work on the test had been completed by [[Alfred Binet]] and [[Théodore Simon]] of [[France]]. Terman promoted his test – the "Stanford-Binet" – as an aid for the classification of developmentally disabled children. Early on, Terman adopted [[William Stern (psychologist)|William Stern]]'s suggestion that ''mental age/chronological age times 100'' be made the ''[[intelligence quotient]]'' or ''IQ''. Later revisions adopted the Wechsler cohort-norming of IQ.

Revisions (mostly recently the fifth) of the Stanford-Binet remain in widespread use as a measure of [[general intelligence]] for both adults and for children.

The first mass administration of IQ testing was done with 1.7 million soldiers during [[World War I]], when Terman served in a psychological testing role with the United States military. Terman was able to work with other applied psychologists to categorize army recruits.  The recruits were given group intelligence tests which took about an hour to administer. Testing options included [[Army Alpha]], a text-based test, and [[Army Beta]], a picture-based test for nonreaders. 25% could not complete the Alpha test.&lt;ref&gt;Teigen, En psykologihistorie, page 235&lt;/ref&gt;  The examiners scored the tests on a scale ranging from "A" through "E".

Recruits who earned scores of "A" would be trained as officers while those who earned scores of "D" and "E" would never receive officer training.  The work of psychologists during the war proved to Americans that intelligence tests could have broader utility.  After the war Terman and his colleagues pressed for intelligence tests to be used in schools to improve the efficiency of growing American schools.

=== Origins of ability ===
Terman followed J. McKeen Cattell's work which combined the ideas of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[Francis Galton]] saying that those who are intellectually superior will have better "sensory acuity, strength of grip, sensitivity to pain, and memory for dictated consonants".&lt;ref name=Seagoe&gt;May V. Seagoe (1975). ''Terman and the gifted''. Los Altos, CA: William Kaufmann Inc. 1981. {{ISBN|978-0913232279}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Clark University]], Terman wrote his doctoral dissertation entitled ''Genius and stupidity: a study of some of the intellectual processes of seven "bright" and seven "stupid" boys''. He administered Cattell's tests on boys who were considered intelligent versus boys who were considered unintelligent.&lt;ref&gt;Terman, L.M. (1906). Genius and stupidity: a study of some of the intellectual processes of seven 'bright' and seven 'stupid' boys. Pedagogical Seminary, 13, 307-373.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Binet and Simon, whose goal was to identify less able school children in order to aid them with the needed care required, Terman proposed using IQ tests to classify children and put them on the appropriate job-track. He believed IQ was inherited and was the strongest predictor of one's ultimate success in life. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Psychology of Extreme Talent ===

Terman's study of genius and gifted children was a lifelong interest.&lt;ref&gt;(Vialle, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; His fascination with the intelligence of children began early in his career since he was familiar with [[Alfred Binet]]'s research in this area.&lt;ref name=Bernreuter&gt;Bernreuter, R. G., Miles, C.C., Tinker, M.A., &amp; Young, K. (1942). ''Studies in personality.'' New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his studies on gifted children, Terman hoped first, to discover the best educational settings for gifted children and, second, to test and dispel the negative stereotypes that gifted children were "conceited, freakish, socially eccentric, and [insane]".&lt;ref name=Bern11&gt;Bernreuter, R. G., Miles, C.C., Tinker, M.A., &amp; Young, K. (1942). ''Studies in personality.'' New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Book Company. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the research had looked at genius adults had been retrospective, examining their early years for clues to the development of talent. With Binet's development of [[IQ tests]], it became possible to quickly identify gifted children and study them from their early childhood into adulthood.&lt;ref name=Bernreuter/&gt; In his 1922 paper called ''A New Approach to the Study of Genius'', Terman noted that this advancement in testing marked a change in research on geniuses and giftedness.&lt;ref&gt;(Terman, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his life Terman developed several methods for examining individuals with high ability, such as the longitudinal method and above-level testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|title=History and development of above-level testing of the gifted|journal=Roeper Review|date=2012|volume=34|pages=183–193|doi=10.1080/02783193.2012.686425|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02783193.2012.686425|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these procedures would be adopted by other social scientists studying very different populations.

Terman found his answers in his [[longitudinal study]] on gifted children: [[Genetic Studies of Genius]].&lt;ref&gt;Minton, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Initiated in 1921, the Genetic Studies of Genius was from the outset a long-term study of [[gifted children]]. Published in five volumes, Terman followed children with extremely high IQ in childhood throughout their lives. The fifth volume examined the children in a 35-year follow-up, and looked at the gifted group during mid-life.&lt;ref name="Terman, 1959"&gt;(Terman, 1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic Studies of Genius revealed that gifted and genius children were in at least as good as average health and had normal personalities. Few of them demonstrated the previously-held negative stereotypes of gifted children. He found that gifted children did not fit the existing stereotypes often associated with them: they were not weak and sickly social misfits, but in fact were generally taller, in better health, better developed physically, and better adapted socially than other children. The children included in his studies were colloquially referred to as "Termites".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Terman's Kids: The Groundbreaking Study of How the Gifted Grow Up |last=Shurkin |first=Joel |year=1992 |publisher=Little, Brown |location=Boston (MA) |isbn=978-0-316-78890-8 |laysummary=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-31/books/bk-1247_1_lewis-terman/2 |laydate=28 June 2010 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gifted children thrived both socially and academically. In relationships, they were less likely to divorce.&lt;ref name=Seagoe/&gt; Additionally, those in the gifted group were generally successful in their careers: Many received awards recognizing their achievements. Though many of the children reached exceptional heights in adulthood, not all did. Terman explored the causes of obvious talent not being realized, exploring personal obstacles, education, and lack of opportunity as causes.&lt;ref name=Bernreuter/&gt;

Terman died before he completed the fifth volume of ''Genetic Studies of Genius,'' but Melita Oden, a colleague, completed the volume and published it.&lt;ref name="Terman, 1959"/&gt; Terman wished for the study to continue on after his death, so he selected [[Robert Richardson Sears]], one of the many successful participants in the study as well as a colleague of his, to continue with the work.&lt;ref name=Seagoe/&gt; The study is still supported by [[Stanford University]] and will continue until the last of the "Termites" withdraws from the study or dies.

==== Role of complex tasks in developing potential ====
In 1915, he wrote a paper called ''The mental hygiene of exceptional children''.&lt;ref&gt;(Terman, 1915)&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that though he believed the capacity for intelligence is inherited, those with exceptional intelligence also need exceptional schooling. Terman wrote that "[bright children] are rarely given tasks which call forth their best ability, and as a result they run the risk of falling into lifelong habits of submaximum efficiency".&lt;ref name=Bernreuter/&gt; In other words, nature (heredity) plays a large role in determining intelligence, but nurture (the environment) is also important in fostering the innate intellectual ability.  By his own admission, there was nothing in his own ancestry that would have led anyone to predict him to have an intellectual career.&lt;ref&gt;Terman, L.M. (1932). Autobiography. In C. Murchison (Ed.), ''A history of psychology, Vol.II'' (pp. 297-332). Worcester, MA; Clark University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Terman found too that while exceptional childhood IQ was associated with many great adult achievements, participants as a whole did not greatly exceed the socio-economic outcomes of others from similar social class backgrounds.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Non-IQ factors may include hard work, luck, social contacts, good health, and other skills.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Legacy ==
From 1957 until 2018, Terman and his son had a middle school name after them. In 2018, the school board of the [[Palo Alto Unified School District]] unanimously decided to rename the school in honor of Ellen Fletcher after Terman's involvement with the eugenics movement came to the notice of parents and the school board.&lt;ref name="paw-2018mar28"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2018/03/27/school-board-votes-to-rename-schools-after-frank-greene-ellen-fletcher |title=School board votes to rename schools after Frank Greene, Ellen Fletcher: Divisive, years long debate ends with final decision Tuesday night |newspaper=[[Palo Alto Weekly]] |date=March 28, 2018 |first=Elena |last=Kadvany}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sjmn-2018mar28"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/03/28/palo-alto-middle-schools-to-be-named-after-frank-greene-jr-ellen-fletcher/ |title=Palo Alto: Middle schools to be named after Frank Greene Jr., Ellen Fletcher: Terman Middle School will be renamed in honor of Ellen Fletcher, Jordan Middle will be renamed after Frank Greene Jr., putting end to controversy |newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]] |date=March 28, 2018 |first=Kevin |last=Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="go-2017mar31"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://gunnoracle.com/12913/news/board-cuts-eugenecist-ties-with-vote-to-rename-schools/ |title=Board cuts eugenicist ties with vote to rename schools |website=Gunn Oracle |date=March 31, 2017 |last1=Ashoke |first1=Sohini |last2=Lee |first2=Amanda |last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His son [[Frederick Terman]], as [[Provost (education)|provost]] of [[Stanford University]], greatly expanded the science, statistics and engineering departments that helped catapult Stanford into the ranks of the world's first class educational institutions, as well as spurring the growth of [[Silicon Valley]]. Stanford University has an endowed professorship in his [[honor]].

==Support for eugenics==

Terman came to believe that IQ was, in addition to dependent on education, highly [[heritable]].

His innovative wide-scale IQ testing exposed him to diverse groups of test-takers. Administering the tests to Spanish-speakers and unschooled African-Americans from the Southwest, he concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;High-grade or border-line deficiency... is very, very common among Spanish-Indian and Mexican families of the Southwest and also among negroes. Their dullness seems to be racial, or at least inherent in the family stocks from which they come... Children of this group should be segregated into separate classes... They cannot master [[Abstract thought|abstractions]] but they can often be made into efficient workers... from a eugenic point of view they constitute a grave problem because of their unusually prolific breeding (''The Measurement of Intelligence'', 1916, p. 91-92).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Testing other groups in California, he observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps a median IQ of 80 for Italian, Portuguese, and Mexican school children in the cities of California would be a liberal estimate. How much of this inferiority is due to the language handicap and to other environmental factors it is impossible to say, but the relatively good showing made by certain other immigrant groups similarly handicapped would suggest that the true causes lie deeper than environment. (''Mental and Physical Traits of a Thousand Gifted Children, Volume 1'', 1925, p. 57)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The suggestions of a significant role for genetics in IQ led Terman to later join the [[Human Betterment Foundation]], a [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]-based [[eugenics]] group founded by [[E. S. Gosney]] in 1928 which had as part of its agenda the promotion and enforcement of [[compulsory sterilization]] laws in [[California]].

A modern-day assessment of Terman's contributions concluded:

{{quote|Lewis Terman was a man of his less-than-enlightened time. He believed in eugenics, and his research project was called "Genetic Studies of Genius." He naively assumed that his high IQ kids (nearly all white) would become the future leaders of science, industry, and politics. His inclusion of girls was an important exception to the [[bias]]es of the era, since women had only just gotten [[Voting rights in the United States#women|the right to vote]], and had few career options.

However, Terman was above all a scientist; and he was dedicated to collecting meaningful data, and to accepting what the data showed even when it contradicted his beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/looking-in-the-cultural-mirror/201206/psychological-predictors-long-life |title=Psychological Predictors of Long Life |date= June 5, 2012 |work=Looking in the Cultural Mirror |publisher=psychologytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

(eds.). (2010). Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences. Vol. 1-7. CRC Press, Boca Raton, USA. Also available as an electronic source.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Library and Information Sciences is the name used in the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] for class 20 from the 18th edition (1971) to the 22nd edition (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; or as "'''library and information studies'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada Library School University Programs|url=http://www.canadian-universities.net/Universities/Programs/Library_School.html|website=www.canadian-universities.net|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a merging of [[library science]] and [[information science]]. The joint term is associated with schools of library and information science (abbreviated to "SLIS"). In the last part of the 1960s, [[library school|schools of librarianship]], which generally developed from professional training programs (not academic disciplines) to university institutions during the second half of the 20th century, began to add the term "information science" to their names. The first school to do this was at the University of Pittsburgh in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Galvin, T. J. (1977). Pittsburgh. University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Library and Information Sciences. IN: Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science (Vol. 22). Ed. by A. Kent, H. Lancour &amp; J.E.Daily. New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc. (pp. 280–291)&lt;/ref&gt; More schools followed during the 1970s and 1980s, and by the 1990s almost all library schools in the USA had added information science to their names.
Weaver Press:
Although there are exceptions, similar developments have taken place in other parts of the world. In Denmark, for example, the 'Royal School of Librarianship' changed its English name to [[The Royal School of Library and Information Science]] in 1997. Exceptions include Tromsø, Norway, where the term [[documentation science]] is the preferred name of the field, France, where information science and communication studies form one [[interdiscipline]],&lt;ref&gt;Mucchielli, A., (2000), La nouvelle communication : épistémologie des sciences de l’informationcommunication. Paris, Armand Colin, 2000. Collection U. Sciences de la communication&lt;/ref&gt; and Sweden, where the fields of [[Archival science]], [[Library science]] and [[Museology]] have been integrated as Archival, Library and Museum studies.

In spite of various trends to merge the two fields, some consider the two original disciplines, [[library science]] and [[information science]], to be separate.&lt;ref name="Saracevic"&gt;Saracevic, Tefko (1992). Information science: origin, evolution and relations. In: ''Conceptions of library and information science. Historical, empirical and theoretical perspectives''.

In: ''Conceptions of library and information science. Historical, empirical and theoretical perspectives''. Edited by Pertti Vakkari &amp; Blaise Cronin. London: Taylor Graham  (pp. 229-252).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tendency today is to use the terms as [[synonym]]s or to drop the term "library" and to speak about ''information departments'' or ''[[I-school]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Educating a new generation of library and information science professionals: A

B. (Ed.) (2004). Aware and responsible. Papers of the Nordic- International Colloquium on Social and Cultural Awareness and responsibility in Library, Information, and Documentation Studies (SCARLID). Lanham, MD:&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations between library science, information science and LIS==
Tefko Saracevic (1992, p.&amp;nbsp;13)&lt;ref name="Saracevic"/&gt; argued that library science and information science are separate fields:

{{quote|The common ground between library science and information science, which is a strong one, is in the sharing of their social role and in their general concern with the problems of effective utilization of graphic records. But there are also very significant differences in several critical respects, among them in: (1) selection of problems addressed and in the way they were defined; (2) theoretical questions asked and frameworks established;(3) the nature and degree of experimentation and empirical development and the resulting practical knowledge/competencies derived; (4) tools and approaches used; and (5) the nature and strength of interdisciplinary relations established and the dependence of the progress and evolution of interdisciplinary approaches. All of these differences warrant the conclusion that librarianship and information science are two different fields in a strong interdisciplinary relation, rather than one and the same field, or one being a special case of the other.}}

Another indication of the different uses of the two terms are the indexing in UMI's [[Dissertations Abstracts]]. In ''Dissertations Abstracts Online'' on November 2011 were 4888 dissertations indexed with the descriptor LIBRARY SCIENCE and 9053 with the descriptor INFORMATION SCIENCE. For the year 2009 the numbers were 104 LIBRARY SCIENCE and 514 INFORMATION SCIENCE. 891 dissertations were indexed with both terms (36 in 2009).

It should be considered that information science grew out of [[documentation science]] and therefore has a tradition for considering scientific and scholarly communication, [[bibliographic database]]s, subject knowledge and terminology etc. Library science, on the other hand has mostly concentrated on libraries and their internal processes and best practices. It is also relevant to consider that information science used to be done by scientists, while librarianship has been split between public libraries and scholarly research libraries. [[Library school]]s have mainly educated librarians for public libraries and not shown much interest in scientific communication and documentation. When information scientists from 1964 entered library schools, they brought with them competencies in relation to information retrieval in subject databases, including concepts such as recall and precision, boolean search techniques, query formulation and related issues. Subject bibliographic databases and citation indexes provided a major step forward in information dissemination - and also in the curriculum at library schools.

Julian Warner (2010)&lt;ref name="Warner"&gt;Warner, Julian (2010). ''Human information retrieval.''Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the information and computer science tradition in [[information retrieval]] may broadly be characterized as '''query transformation''', with the query articulated verbally by the user in advance of searching and then transformed by a system into a set of records. From librarianship and indexing, on the other hand, has been an implicit stress on '''selection power''' enabling the user to make relevant selections.

==Difficulties defining LIS==
"The question, 'What is library and information science?' does not elicit responses of the same internal conceptual coherence as similar inquiries as to the nature of other fields, e.g., 'What is chemistry?', 'What is economics?', 'What is medicine?' Each of those fields, though broad in scope, has clear ties to basic concerns of their field. [...] Neither LIS theory nor practice is perceived to be monolithic nor unified by a common literature or set of professional skills. Occasionally, LIS scholars (many of whom do not self-identify as members of an interreading LIS community, or prefer names other than LIS), attempt, but are unable, to find core concepts in common. Some believe that computing and internetworking concepts and skills underlie virtually every important aspect of LIS, indeed see LIS as a sub-field of computer science! [Footnote III.1] Others claim that LIS is principally a social science accompanied by practical skills such as ethnography and interviewing. Historically, traditions of public service, bibliography, documentalism, and information science have viewed their mission, their philosophical toolsets, and their domain of research differently. Still others deny the existence of a greater metropolitan LIS, viewing LIS instead as a loosely organized collection of specialized interests often unified by nothing more than their shared (and fought-over) use of the descriptor information. Indeed, claims occasionally arise to the effect that the field even has no theory of its own." (Konrad, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;652-653).

=== A multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary or monodisciplinary field? ===
The Swedish researcher Emin Tengström (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Tengström, E. (1993). Biblioteks- och informationsvetenskapen - ett fler- eller tvär-vetenskapligt område? Svensk Biblioteksforskning,(1), 9-20.&lt;/ref&gt; described [[cross-disciplinary]] research as a process, not a state or structure. He differentiates three levels of ambition regarding cross-disciplinary research:
* The "[[Pluridisciplinary]]" or "[[multidisciplinarity]]" level
* The genuine cross-disciplinary level: "[[interdisciplinarity]]"
* The discipline-forming level "[[transdisciplinarity]]"

What is described here is a view of social fields as dynamic and changing. Library and information science is viewed as a field that started as a multidisciplinary field based on literature, psychology, sociology, management, computer science etc., which is developing towards an [[academic discipline]] in its own right. However, the following quote seems to indicate that LIS is actually developing in the opposite direction:

Chua &amp; Yang (2008)&lt;ref&gt;Chua, A.  &amp; Yang, C.C. (2008). The shift towards multi-disciplinarity in information science, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 59(13), 2156–2170.&lt;/ref&gt; studied papers published in ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'' in the period 1988-1997 and found, among other things: "Top authors have grown in diversity from those being affiliated predominantly with library/information-related departments to include those from information systems management, information technology, business, and the humanities. Amid heterogeneous clusters of collaboration among top authors, strongly connected crossdisciplinary
coauthor pairs have become more prevalent. Correspondingly, the distribution of top keywords’ occurrences that leans heavily on core information science has shifted towards other subdisciplines such as information technology and sociobehavioral science."

A more recent study revealed that 31% of the papers published in 31 LIS journals from 2007 through 2012 were by authors in academic departments of library and information science (i.e., those offering degree programs accredited by the [[American Library Association]] or similar professional organizations in other countries).  Faculty in departments of [[computer science]] (10%), [[management]] (10%), [[communication]] (3%), the other social sciences (9%), and the other natural sciences (7%) were also represented.  Nearly one-quarter of the papers in the 31 journals were by practicing librarians, and 6% were by others in non-academic (e.g., corporate) positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walters|first=William H.|last2=Wilder|first2=Esther Isabelle|date=2016|title=Disciplinary, national, and departmental contributions to the literature of library and information science, 2007-2012|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23448|journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|language=en|volume=67|issue=6|pages=1487–1506|doi=10.1002/asi.23448|issn=2330-1635|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a field with its own body of interrelated concepts, techniques, journals, and professional associations, LIS is clearly a discipline. But by the nature of its subject matter and methods LIS is just as clearly an [[interdiscipline]], drawing on many adjacent fields (see below).

=== A fragmented adhocracy ===
Richard Whitley (1984,&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, R. (1984). The fragmented state of management studies: Reasons and consequences. Journal of management studies, 21(3), 331-348.&lt;/ref&gt; 2000)&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, R. (2000). The intellectual and social organization of the sciences.
Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; classified scientific fields according to their intellectual and social organization and described management studies as a ‘fragmented adhocracy’, a field with a low level of coordination around a diffuse set of goals and a non-specialized terminology; but with strong connections to the practice in the business sector. Åström (2006)&lt;ref name="Astrom"&gt;Åström, F. (2006). The social and intellectual development of library and information science. Doctoral theses at the Department of Sociology, Umeå University,. No 48 2006. http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:145144/FULLTEXT01&lt;/ref&gt; applied this conception to the description of LIS.

=== Scattering of the literature ===
Meho &amp; Spurgin (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Meho, Lokman I. &amp; Spurgin, Kristina M. (2005). Ranking the Research Productivity of Library and Information Science Faculty and Schools: An Evaluation of Data Sources and Research Methods. ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'', 56(12), 1314–1331.&lt;/ref&gt; found that in a list of 2,625 items published between 1982 and 2002 by 68 faculty members of 18 schools of library and information science, only 10 databases provided significant coverage of the LIS literature. Results also show that restricting the data sources to one, two, or even three databases leads to inaccurate rankings and erroneous conclusions. Because no database provides comprehensive coverage of the LIS literature, researchers must rely on a wide range of disciplinary and multidisciplinary databases for ranking and other research purposes. Even when the nine most comprehensive databases in LIS was searched and combined, 27.0% (or 710 of 2,635) of the publications remain not found.
{{quote|The study confirms earlier research that LIS literature is highly scattered and is not limited to standard LIS databases. What was not known or verified before, however, is that a significant amount of this literature is indexed in the interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary databases of Inside Conferences and INSPEC. Other interdisciplinary databases, such as America: History and Life, were also found to be very useful and complementary to traditional LIS databases, particularly in the areas of archives and library history. (Meho &amp; Spurgin, 2005, p.1329).}}

==The unique concern of library and information science==
"Concern for people becoming informed is not unique to LIS, and thus is insufficient to differentiate LIS from other fields. LIS are a part of a larger enterprise." (Konrad, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;655).&lt;ref&gt;Konrad, A. (2007). On inquiry: Human concept formation and construction of meaning through library and information science intermediation (Unpublished doctoral dissertation). University of California, Berkeley. Retrieved from http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1s76b6hp&lt;/ref&gt;

"The unique concern of LIS is recognized as: Statement of the core concern of LIS:
'''Humans becoming informed (constructing meaning) via intermediation between inquirers and instrumented records'''. No other field has this as its concern. " (Konrad, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;660)

"Note that the promiscuous term ''information'' does not appear in the above statement circumscribing the field's central concerns: The detrimental effects of the ambiguity this term provokes are discussed above (Part III). Furner [Furner 2004, 427] has shown that discourse in the field is improved where specific terms are utilized in place of the i-word for specific senses of that term." (Konrad, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;661).

Michael Buckland wrote: "Educational programs in library, information and documentation are concerned with what people know, are not limited to technology, and require wide-ranging expertise. They differ fundamentally and importantly from computer science programs and from the information systems programs found in business schools.".&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael K. (2004). Reflections on social and cultural awareness and responsibility in library, information and documentation - Commentary on the SCARLID colloquium. In: Rayward, W. B. (Ed.). ''Aware and responsible. Papers of the Nordic- International Colloquium on Social and Cultural Awareness and responsibility in Library, Information, and Documentation Studies (SCARLID)''. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. (pp. 169-175).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bawden and Robinson argue that while Information Science has overlaps with numerous other disciplines with interest in studying communication, it is unique in that it is concerned with all aspects of the communication chain.&lt;ref name = "Bawden"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bawden|first1=David|last2=Robinson|first2=Lyn|title=Introduction to information science|date=2013|publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers, Incorporated|location=Chicago|isbn=9781555708610}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6,8}}  For example Computer Science may be interested in the indexing and retrieval, sociology with user studies, and publishing (business) with dissemination, whereas information science is interested in the study of all of these individual areas and the interactions between them.&lt;ref name="Bawden"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

The organization of information and information resources is one of the fundamental aspects of LIS. &lt;ref name="Bawden"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|106}} and is an example of both LIS's uniqueness and its multidisciplinary origins.  Some of the main tools used by LIS toward this end to provide access to the digital resources of modern times (particularly theory relating to indexing and classification) originated in 19th century to assist humanity's effort to make its intellectual output accessible by recording, identifying, and providing bibliographic control of printed knowledge.  &lt;ref name="Bawden"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|105}}.  The origin for some of these tools were even earlier. For example, in the 17th century, during the [[History_of_libraries#Enlightenment_era_libraries|'golden age of libraries']], publishers and sellers seeking to take advantage of the burgeoning book trade developed descriptive catalogs of their wares for distribution – a practice was adopted and further extrapolated by many libraries of the time to cover areas like philosophy, sciences, linguistics, medicine, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=Library : an illustrated history.|date=2012|publisher=W W Norton|location=New York|isbn=9781616084530}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|120}}  In this way, a business concern of publishers – keeping track of and advertising inventory – was developed into a system for organizing and preserving information by the library.

The development of [[Metadata]] is another area that exemplifies the aim of LIS to be something more than an mishmash of several disciplines – that uniqueness Bawden and Robinson describe.  Pre-Internet classification systems and [[Cataloging|cataloging]] systems were mainly concerned with two objectives: 1. to provide rich bibliographic descriptions and relations between information objects and 2. to facilitate sharing of this bibliographic information across library boundaries.&lt;ref name = "Qin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeng|first1=Marcia Lei|last2=Qin|first2=Jian|title=Metadata.|date=2014|publisher=Neal-Schuman|location=New York|isbn=978-1-55570-965-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{rp|14}}  The development of the Internet and the information explosion that followed found many communities needing mechanisms for the description, authentication and management of their information. &lt;ref name = "Qin"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}  These communities developed taxonomies and controlled vocabularies to describe their knowledge as well as unique information architectures to communicate these classifications and libraries found themselves as liaison or translator between these metadata systems.  &lt;ref name = "Qin"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15-16}}  Of course the concerns of cataloging in the Internet era have gone beyond simple bibliographic descriptions.  The need for descriptive information about the ownership and copyright of a digital product – a publishing concern – and description for the different formats and accessibility features of a resource – a sociological concern – show the continued development and cross discipline necessity of resource description.&lt;ref name = "Qin"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}

==LIS theories==
Julian Warner (2010, p.&amp;nbsp;4-5)&lt;ref name="Warner"/&gt; suggests that

{{quote|Two paradigms, the cognitive and the physical, have been distinguished in information retrieval research, but they share the assumption of the value of delivering relevant records (Ellis 1984, 19;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, David (1984). Theory and explanation in information retrieval research. ''Journal of Information Science'', 8, 25-38&lt;/ref&gt; Belkin and Vickery 1985, 114&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, N. J. &amp; Vickery, A. (1985)- ''Interaction in information systems: A review of research from document retrieval to knowledge-based systems.'' London: British Library (Library and Information Research Report 35).&lt;/ref&gt;). For the purpose of discussion here, they can be considered a single heterogeneous paradigm, linked but not united by this common assumption. The value placed on query transformation is dissonant with common practice, where users may prefer to explore an area and may value fully informed exploration. Some dissenting research discussions have been more congruent with practice, advocating explorative capability - the ability to explore and make discriminations between representations of objects - as the fundamental design principle for information retrieval systems.}}

The domain analytic approach (e.g., Hjørland 2010&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, Birger (2010). The foundation of the concept of relevance. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology. 61(2), 217-237.&lt;/ref&gt;) suggests that the relevant criteria for making discriminations in information retrieval are scientific and scholarly criteria. In some fields (e.g. evidence-based medicine)&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, Birger (2011). Evidence based practice: An analysis based on the philosophy of science. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 62(7), 1301-1310.&lt;/ref&gt; the relevant distinctions are very explicit. In other cases they are implicit or unclear. At the basic level, the relevance of bibliographical records are determined by epistemological criteria of what constitutes knowledge.

Among other approaches, [[Evidence Based Library and Information Practice]] should also be mentioned.

There is often an overlap between these subfields of LIS and other fields of study. Most information retrieval research, for example, belongs to computer science. Knowledge management is considered a subfield of management or organizational studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Knowledge Management|editor1-last=Clegg|editor1-first=Stewart|editor2-last=Bailey|editor2-first=James R.|title=International Encyclopedia of Organizational Studies|date=2008|publisher=Sage Publications Inc.|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|isbn=978-1-4129-5390-0|pages=758-762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Omerta – City of Gangsters''''' is a [[simulation game]] with [[Turn-based tactics|turn-based tactical]] game-play elements developed by [[Haemimont Games]] and published by [[Kalypso Media]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] and the [[Xbox 360]]. The game was released in [[German-speaking Europe|German-speaking]] countries on 31 January 2013. The international German download version for Windows was released through the [[Steam (software)|Steam-service]] as well. The English version was released just a day after in the rest of Europe whereas the version for the US market was released on 12 February. A version for Mac OS X was published on 2 August 2013.&lt;ref name="Mac-Release" /&gt;

== Plot ==
The title covers the time of the 1920s - the [[Roaring Twenties]] - at the time of the [[Prohibition in the United States]]. The game's story takes place in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], [[Atlantic County, New Jersey|Atlantic County]] where, due to the ban of any alcohol in this era, Mafia organizations were able to become powerful off the back of the illegal [[speakeasy]]s.

In a time where criminal [[gang]]s rule the city and a handful of morally-questionable men were able to succeed through illegal gambling, high-strength spirits and shady machinations, the player's storyline takes place as the main character creates his empire in this melting pot of illegality. Boss D'Angelo is an immigrant who was born in a small village in [[Sicily]] and has just arrived in [[Atlantic City]]. He has to work his way up the ladder through the [[Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven|Mafia]]-like world. Working his way up from nothing, He must establish himself in the criminal underworld by buying and raiding businesses and attacking rivals, all the while simultaneously fulfilling his version of the [[American dream]].

==Story==

Arriving at Atlantic City, Boss D'Angelo begins his foothold on the criminal empire as he makes money off the prohibition and gambling trade. Sending money back to his brother, he keeps his status as a mob boss secret from him as he works for Louie, a Capo under the eye of Danny Corsini, the leader of the Mafia in Atlantic City. His enemies ranges from independent gangsters to the [[Ku Klux Klan]], which is at bitter odds with the growing immigration problem. Eventually tired of working for Louie, he was sent to perform one last job which was revealed to be a trap, as Danny Corsini was the intended target. The Boss thwarts the assassination and becomes a Capo under Corsini.

Expanding his criminal empire eventually allows his brother to come to Atlantic City but not as a brother in crime an [[FBI]] Agent in New York. When the Boss' attempts to set up a source of income through the gambling/nightclub trade draw suspicion to him, Danny Corsini attempts to defend him killing his brother. Forced to turn on Corsini, the Boss emerges victorious. Knowing that his position is fragile, he attempts to unite the Jewish Gangs and Irish Mob in an alliance only for it to be attacked by the KKK. With the D'Angelo mob as the sole survivor of the struggle, the Boss is named Capo de Tutti. He later earns money through real estate and by supporting Mr. Smith as mayor which gives him great influence in the city, upon reaching Michigan Ave his brother offers one last chance for the Boss to come clean, the Boss rejects the idea of selling his men out and eliminates the witnesses who planned to rat out the boss. The Boss came out clean and triumphant and made amends with his brother and owns a private island which he calls Nova Sicilia and his brother left the agency to pursue his dream of being a shipwright and vowed to never speak of their days in the prohibition again.

'''The Japanese Incentive'''

Somewhere in between the meeting of his brother and the death of Louie Castaneda, Boss D'Angelo receives a lucrative offer from a Japanese Yakuza Hikaro Eda and Fritz, a backer who wanted to help Eda exert his influence into America as laws back then prohibited Asians from owning property. There he meets the beautiful Mikoto Mori, the trophy wife of the Yakuza boss. Little did the boss know, she has a personal vendetta against Hikaro and the Boss now is caught in between love for the woman and the wrath of a powerful man.

The story begins with Karl Fritz who approaches the Boss with a deal from Hikaro Eda, an influential Japanese man who had him muscle into McGyure Clan's turf and quickly proves his worth to Hikaro and was tasked with a smuggling job from him. Upon preventing the McGyure Clan from destroying the cargo did he realize what was he smuggling, his wife Kumiko Mori. Angered by the McGyure's attempt at murdering her he personally wipes out the clan and earns a promising alliance with the Yakuza. When Hikaro and his men were attacked at a Cherry Blossom festival by members of the Ku Klux Klan did Hikaro sent him to find who tried to kill him and the Boss learned that Hikaro's own wife was the culprit. Sickened by this senseless conflict he tries to run off with her in an attempt to escape from the criminal underworld only to be dragged down by Hikaro when he tries to kill them both. Then she reveals her past, her family's lands was taken away by Eda and her sister was killed by Hikaro and she was forced to become the bride and assassin of Hikaro. They both work together to take down Eda and eventually have feelings for one another but the heist on Eda's personal assets goes awry when Mikoto goes off to try and kill Eda only to die in the process, in a fit of rage the Boss personally attacks Eda and gets his revenge for Mikoto as he bitterly says that she was the first and last woman he had ever truly loved.

=== Trivia ===
Omerta, the game's title, refers to the infamous [[honor code]] called ''"[[Omertà]]"'', a ''"[[Code of silence]]"'' which binds members of the [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] or similar criminal organizations to professional discretion against any third parties.

Upon the official retail-release of the boxed- and digital distributed version, the game was also simultaneously released on [[GOG.com]] without any [[copy-protection]], nor other [[digital rights management]] restrictions.&lt;ref name="GOG.com"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[GOG.com|GoG.com]] |title='Omerta - City of Gangsters' on ''Good Old Games''|url=http://www.gog.com/gamecard/omerta_city_of_gangsters |date=2013-01-31 |access-date=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
Beginning with small deals, the player gradually expands his criminal career, eventually advancing highly enough to establish his own business. The player can purchase untenanted shops, buildings and structures to establish his own bar, brewery or distillery. The player can also buy out an opposing ''speakeasy''. A more legal way for generating income is buying apartments to obtain leasing. Warehouses can be acquired to extend storage.

As the game progresses, the character can recruit companions, create his own gang, and conquer the territories of rival gangsters. Characters provide specific [[Role-playing game system|role-playing elements]] based on their individual characteristics and equipment. In these [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based]] confrontations, the player expands his influence by using henchmen to drive other godfathers out of business, to ultimately reign supreme as the unchallenged patron of Atlantic City.&lt;ref name="Kalypso-Announce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.kalypsomedia.com/showthread.php?tid=13774 |title=Guns, Money, Honor - Kalypso Unveils "Omerta – City of {{Sic|nolink=y|Gang|ters|expected=Gangsters}}" |last1=Official forum moderator |first1="Melbourne" |date=6 March 2012 |work=Official forum |publisher=[[Kalypso Media]] |accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to co-operative and competitive multiplayer game-play, the game offers a [[Open-ended (gameplay)#Sandbox mode|sandbox mode]] to freely explore the game world – six district maps covering ''Atlantic City''.

=== Historical background ===
[[File:Traymore1930.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The renowned Traymore Hotel in Atlantic City, circa 1930]]
The game provides an explorable three-dimensional world which is displayed through a [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|Top-down perspective]]. The in-game world represents, according to the publisher Kalypso Media,&lt;ref name="Kalypso-AtlanticCity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.kalypsomedia.com/showthread.php?tid=16677 |title=New Images from "Omerta – City of Gangsters" (Buildings)|last1=Official forum moderator |first1="Melbourne" |date=25 September 2012 |work=Official forum |publisher=[[Kalypso Media]] |accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; an almost accurate and historical correct reproduction of the American city ''Atlantic City'' of this period.

Real vintage buildings and places are present like the [[Traymore Hotel]], the [[Absecon Light]]house, the ''Atlantic City Jail-house'' or the board-walk "Eastern Promenade" as well as streets like ''Illinois Avenue'' or the ''North Carolina Avenue'' which ends at the beach. Beside those real buildings the remaining ones - which are shown in [[Art Deco]] - are very similar to each other and seems to consist only of a few types.

== Licensing of name ==
Kalypso Media licensed the name 'Omerta' from the [[MMORPG]] browser based game of the same name, [[Omerta (video game)|Omerta]].

== Reception ==
[[Metacritic]] aggregated a score of 54 from 100 points for the Windows version.&lt;ref name="Meta-PC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/omerta-city-of-gangsters |title=Omerta: City of Gangsters for PC Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More - Metacritic |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |authorlink=Metacritic |date=31 January 2013 |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''PCGamer'' gave the PC-version a rating of 78 out of 100 points, praising the game's mechanics as well as the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] while comparing its combat style elements to [[X-COM]] or [[Jagged Alliance]]. The story is described as too superficial and simple, just depth-less. The atmospheric music, on the other hand, was lauded as a brilliant melange of the [[Jazz]], [[Ragtime]] and [[Klezmer]] music of the period.

{{Quote|'''"Not as tough or as deep as it could be, Omerta is still a destination well worth a visit."'''|Tim Stone|PCGamer.com&lt;ref name="PCGamer-review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/review/omerta-city-of-gangsters-review/ |title=Omerta: City of Gangsters review |last=Stone |first=Tim |date=January 31, 2013 |work=Review |publisher=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rating the game at just 30 percent, ''Metro GameCentral'' tested the PC-version as well. Initially intrigued by the promise of a new kind of "made-men" game, the turn-based combat system was ultimately deemed ungainly.

{{Quote|'''"You can see the basis of a good game here but Omerta gets almost everything wrong, from the shallow game-play to the bland, characterless gangster atmosphere."'''|Roger Hargreaves|GameCentral&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;Metro.co.uk&lt;ref name="GameCentral-review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/02/04/omerta-city-of-gangsters-review-refuse-the-offer-3379811/ |title=Omerta: City Of Gangsters review – refuse the offer |last=Hargreaves |first=Roger |date=February 4, 2013 |work=Review |publisher=GameCentral&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;Metro.co.uk |accessdate=February 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Hooked Gamer'' gave the PC-version a rating of 8.4 out of 10. It describes the game as "different", and the turn-based combats as short but satisfying.

[[File:Peggy Vaughan.jpeg|thumbnail|Peggy Vaughan]]
'''Peggy Vaughan''' (1936 &amp;ndash; November 8, 2012), became well known in 1980, when she and her husband, James Vaughan, publicly shared their story of overcoming infidelity on the American [[The Phil Donahue Show|Phil Donahue Show]]&lt;ref&gt;Diluna, Amy. "'Affair' presents both sides," New York Daily News, October 9, 2004. [http://articles.nydailynews.com/2004-10-09/entertainment/18268577_1_oprah-affair-presents]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the book, "Beyond Affairs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" Over the next 30 years, Vaughan became known "as an internationally recognized expert in the area of extramarital affairs."&lt;ref name = "harper"&gt;[http://www.harpercollins.com/authors/10139/Peggy_Vaughan/index.aspx Harper Collins, "Peggy Vaughan."]&lt;/ref&gt; Public reaction led Vaughan to create the ''Beyond Affairs Network'' "to help others whose marriages were impacted by infidelity."&lt;ref name="website"&gt;[http://www.dearpeggy.com/1-aboutus/bio.html DearPeggy.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Vaughan published "The Monogamy Myth," which challenged many of the prevailing attitudes and assumptions about the issue of extramarital affairs with the goal of "helping people be better prepared to either prevent affairs or to recover if it happens."&lt;ref name = "harper"/&gt; A follow-up edition was published in 2003 with the subtitle "A Personal Handbook for Recovering from Affairs."&lt;ref name="website"/&gt;

In addition to multiple appearances on The Phil Donahue Show, Vaughan frequently appeared in the national media as an expert on infidelity, including on Oprah, Montel Williams, CNN, CBS's 48 Hours, and Fox News.&lt;ref name="website"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Elizabeth.

Beginning in 1991, Vaughan and her husband began conducting public seminars for  individuals and couples on "recovering from affairs," later organizing the handouts from those seminars into a handbook for couples.&lt;ref name="website"/&gt; In 1992, the Vaughans wrote "Making Love Stay," which shared their insights about long-term relationships.

In a 1999 keynote at the Smart Marriages conference, Vaughan shared her perspective on rebuilding marriage after an affair:&lt;ref&gt;"The Monogamy Myth," Keynote at 1999 Smart Marriages conference, Washington, D.C. [http://www.smartmarriages.com/monogamy.myth.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Sever contact with the third party and build trust through actions, not promises.
*Make a commitment to honesty and ongoing honest communication.
*Accept the fact that monogamy is an issue that's never settled "once and for all."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After a four-year battle with cancer, Vaughan died at her home in La Jolla, California on November 8, 2012. Upon her death, many of her writings were donated to the public.&lt;ref name="website"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sollee, Diane. "Sad News, Happy News." Smart Marriages, November 11, 2012.

'''''Railroad Tycoon II''''' is a [[train simulator|train]] and [[business simulation]] video game for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Dreamcast]] in the [[Railroad Tycoon (series)|''Railroad Tycoon'' series]]. The Dreamcast version is a Gold Edition with improved graphics and gameplay.  ''Railroad Tycoon II: Gold Edition'' was ported to [[Linux]] by [[Loki Software]].

Gameplay is displayed in [[dimetric projection|dimetric view]], unlike the top-down view of ''[[Railroad Tycoon]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Railroadtyccon screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot from ''Railroad Tycoon II''.]]
''Railroad Tycoon II'' is a [[railroad simulation]] that covers the entire history of railroads from inception to the present day and beyond. The player chooses a map and assumes the role of chairman of a [[railroad company]]. The player tries to make profits for investors and completes various other objectives while being hindered by rivals, random events such as train breakdowns, [[train robber]]s, economic swings, and scripted events particular to the scenario.

Most of the gameplay consists of building tracks, stations and trains, which are used for hauling passengers and freight from one station to another. Delivery revenue can vary by time, distance, demand, cargo type, economic state, station improvements and difficulty level. Companies can connect to and use each other's track and stations, so revenue can be split. Expenses include the fuel, track and engine maintenance and management fee. The fuel cost depends on the cargo weight and the distance each engine runs. Engine maintenance depends on engine age and the engine's type (some locomotives cost more to maintain than others). The elder engines cost more to keep them on the line. The track maintenance is solely calculated from track [[Distance|mileage]].

The player will determine what kind of cargo(es) to put on/off at each station that the player adds to its routing. Way-points may also be inserted to override default track selection where multiple paths are possible.

There are many industries in the game, and each can produce and/or convert specific cargoes. For example, coal mines produce coal, iron mines produce iron, and, in the advanced game, a [[steel mill]] can convert 1 load of [[iron]] plus 1 load of [[coal]] into 2 loads of [[steel]]. The players are encouraged to find a chain of production to make new cargo by hauling the right type of cargo to each step of the industries. By doing this right, the player can haul raw materials one way, "create" manufactured return cargo, and make even more money hauling finished products back the other way.

===Locomotives and industry===
One of the key elements of game play relates to the player purchasing and operating a variety of locomotives, each of which possesses different attributes relating to speed, fuel type, preferred cargo, and the ability to traverse hills and steep track grades. In general, the player should balance the cost of operating a train and the time required to transport cargo, with the balance being that the profit from cargo delivery outweighs train operating costs. The player also may purchase various industrial plants to earn extra money based on amount of cargo received and delivered. Basic industry, such as [[bakery|bakeries]], [[Textile manufacturing|textile mill]]s, and [[Tool and die maker|tool and die factories]], earns less profit than advanced factories such as [[Canning|canneries]], steel mills and [[car|automobile]] plants, although the latter require multiple goods delivered to produce one final product. Furthermore, idle industries which do not produce goods will generate a negative profit, thus increasing overall operating costs and [[Overhead (business)|overhead]].

The following locomotives are available for game play. Locomotives are only seen in specific time periods and scenarios. In addition to the attributes described above, locomotives are subject to "mechanical reliability", which is a randomly generated factor influencing how often a locomotive will break down. All locomotives begin their operational lives with a set chance of mechanical failure, with some types more prone to breakdowns than others. Breakdown percentage chance increases the older a locomotive becomes. A train may also suffer a [[train wreck|wreck]], which completely destroys the locomotive and all hauled cargo.

The game also features one futuristic train, the "Mag-Lev TBX-1" which is portrayed as released in the (then) future date of 2008.  The train operates using [[Maglev]] technology which, as of 2015, has been prototyped in both Europe and Japan.  The first successful Maglev train to be operated was the [[SCMaglev]] with speeds approaching 400 miles per hour.

===Economics===

Gameplay also includes financial manipulation of companies, issuing [[bond (finance)|bond]]s, [[share repurchase]]s, [[stock issue]]s, manipulating [[dividend]]s, merging with other companies and declaring [[bankruptcy]]. These features are required in some scenarios and may be used for either great financial gain or total fiscal disaster.

In normal financial mode, the player may buy or sell any companies' stocks at various prices depending upon the economy. On advanced settings, the broker may allow the player to [[margin (finance)#Margin buying|buy on margin]] or [[short (finance)|short sell]] stocks if he has enough value of stocks or cash to rely on. The computer players may also engage in these practices and will attempt to bankrupt the player when he is heavily in debt.

The economy may fluctuate during gameplay, with five economic states possible: Booming, Prosperity, Normal, [[Recession]] and [[Depression (economics)|Depression]]. When the economy is good, the revenue of hauled goods and stock prices will be higher. Bond interest rates will also be adjusted with the economy level, including the interest received from cash and the interest paid for the bonds.

===Campaigns and scenarios===

The original game features eighteen missions, divided between North America, Europe and the rest of the world. The missions can be played on three difficulty levels, and each also includes three listed objectives.  Completing only the first objective awards the player a bronze medal, the first two a silver medal, and all three a gold medal. The player may play any mission in each set as many times as they wish; they may also continue even though a mission has been failed. The final score for the whole 18 mission campaign is calculated by the difficulty level and the number of each type of medal achieved.

In addition to the campaign, ''Railroad Tycoon II'' features many single scenarios. As with the campaign, each scenario is based on a geographical location, which may be fictional. Most scenarios also have a medal system similar to that of the campaign, although any scenario may be played in [[sandbox mode]] as well. Many scenarios constrain the player to some specific point on the timeline and feature scripted events: for example, the [[Korea]]n map presents an [[alternate history|alternative history]] as the player is informed about the averted [[Korean civil war]].

Additional single scenarios may be created using the [[map editor]] included. Maps may be imported, drawn from scratch, or edited from existing maps and saved under new names. Many fan creations have been shared on various [[fan site]]s.

==Development==
In late 1997, [[Bruce Shelley]] said of his chance of developing ''Railroad Tycoon II'', "I would be happy to work on such a game but there are real doubts about its ability to generate sufficient sales in this blockbuster market where a few of the games make most of the money."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/19990506043125/http://www.gamecenter.com:80/News/Item/Cont/0,4,0-1280_2,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soundtrack===
The soundtrack of ''Railroad Tycoon II'' consist mostly of classical "railroad" blues and bluegrass genre from the era the game revolves around. These pieces were not, unlike most contemporary games, midi files, but rather high quality studio recordings; some even with vocals. This fact has contributed to the solid ratings this game has received.&lt;!--The soundtrack consists of the following tracks:--&gt;

===Editions===
''Railroad Tycoon 2: Gold'' is a collection of ''Railroad Tycoon 2'' and ''Railroad Tycoon 2: The Second Century'', in one package. ''Railroad Tycoon 2: Platinum'' is equivalent to the ''Gold Edition'' plus over 50 community-made maps added and enhanced mouse-wheel support. Maps (scenarios) developed specifically for the platinum edition may not function in some earlier versions. The last official [[patch (computing)|patch]] to ''Railroad Tycoon 2'' was [https://web.archive.org/web/20130414213020/http://www.shacknews.com/file/2301/railroad-tycoon-2-platinum-156-patch platinum v1.56] on February 19, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PhilSteinmeyer.com  » Blog Archive   » The missing Railroad Tycoon 2 map…|url = http://www.philsteinmeyer.com/55/the-missing-railroad-tycoon-2-map/|website = www.philsteinmeyer.com|access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 2000, ''Railroad Tycoon II'' had been released in 39 unique [[Stock keeping unit|SKU]]s worldwide, including eight Windows versions in English alone. PopTop's Phil Steinmeyer wrote that roughly 33% of the game's sales derived from the ''Gold'' edition and ''Second Century'' expansion, and that the port for Macintosh "sold respectably", while the PlayStation version was unsuccessful. He accredited the game's number of versions with its commercial success, and wrote in August 2000, "Overall, had we only released the original game, in English, for Windows only, our sales would be less than a quarter of what they are now."&lt;ref name=steinmeyersales&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050317062552/http://www.cdmag.com/articles/029/034/isf_column.html |url=http://www.cdmag.com:80/articles/029/034/isf_column.html |title=Inside the Sausage Factory; Language Barriers |author=Steinmeyer, Phil |date=August 14, 2000 |work=[[Computer Games Magazine]] |archivedate=March 17, 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Steinmeyer remarked that ''Railroad Tycoon II'' continued to sell "pretty well".&lt;ref name=cgmprev&gt;{{cite journal |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303225823/http://www.cgonline.com/computer-games-magazine/article/return_of_the_king1/ |url=http://www.cgonline.com/computer-games-magazine/article/return_of_the_king1/ |title=Return of the King |author=Sones, Benjamin E. | issue=150 | date=May 2003 |work=[[Computer Games Magazine]] |archivedate=March 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SIT Study Abroad''' is a university-level [[Study abroad organization|study abroad program]] administered by [[World Learning]], a [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3) international non-profit organization]] based in [[Brattleboro, Vermont]], [[United States]]. Like its sister-program the [[SIT Graduate Institute]], the program is accredited by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] through its Commission on Institutions of Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cihe.neasc.org/about_our_institutions/roster_of_institutions/ NEASC Roster of Accredited Institutions.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828132004/http://cihe.neasc.org/about_our_institutions/roster_of_institutions/ |date=2013-08-28 }} Accessed: May 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gooverseas.com/sit-study-abroad-reviews GoOverseas.com SIT Study Abroad Reviews.] Accessed May 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

SIT Study Abroad offers semester and summer-long thematic programs in over 40 countries around the world.  More than 25,000 students have studied abroad with SIT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/thebrownandwhiteblog/index.ssf/2012/03/the_sit_study_abroad_expereinc.html “Students Lectured on SIT Study Abroad Experience,” The Brown &amp; White Blog.] Accessed May 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; All programs are run by Academic Directors who are residents of the host country and experts in the specific academic subject area of the program. Programs incorporate classroom-based and field-based learning as well as an [[independent study|independent study project]] component. Students live in [[homestay]]s, are involved in host community cultural activities and participate in excursions.  All programs study a particular global issue such as health, ecology, conflict transformation, or development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/osuabroad/2011/03/15/study-abroad-with-sit/ OSU Abroad Blog.] Accessed: May 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegenews.com/article/the_advantages_of_field_based_study_abroad_with_sit “Advantages of Field-Based Study Abroad,” CollegeNews.com.] Accessed May 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
SIT Study Abroad’s academic programs use a field-based, experimental approach. Students complete undergraduate research through an Independent Study Project, the content of which is supervised by their advisors. The students have access to SIT’s local resources and networks during their stay, including a small group of their peers that participate in each program. The foundation of SIT’s educational philosophy holds a strong commitment to reciprocity that is fostered through the students experience abroad.

Students may elect to participate in an International Honors Program (IHP). This type of program involves studying in multiple destinations while exploring social justice and sustainability which can offer a more cross-cultural educational experience. IHP and SIT Study Abroad have long shared a profound and defining commitment to intercultural communication, social justice, and experiential learning. IHP’s partnership with SIT Study Abroad and World Learning dates back to 2007, when SIT became IHP’s official school of record. The integration between the two partners deepened in the 2011-2012 academic year, when IHP was first included in SIT Study Abroad’s portfolio of programs. Building on a distinguished 50-plus-year history, IHP comparative programs continue to challenge students to ask new and better questions about their lifelong roles in a global community. Comparative programs offer students the opportunity to investigate significant global issues in at least three countries. Some topics include: Cities in the 21st Century, Climate Change, The Politics of Food, Health and Community, and Human Rights.

==Programs==
SIT has many programs in countries all over the world with a particular focus in developing nations. Each program is designed around a different theme that is relative to the country the student will study in. The website has a full list of current programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studyabroad.sit.edu/programs/ "SIT Study Abroad programs"] Accessed March 3, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

For more than fifty years, SIT has provided carefully designed and thoughtfully facilitated study abroad programs rooted in the experiential education learning model. This model, as popularized by David Kolb, guides students through an intentional approach to structured and unstructured experiences and a facilitated and mentored process of translating experience into learning in order to prepare them for more independent inquiry. Most SIT programs have 20–25 students led by one academic director plus a number of local staff. Semester programs last 15–16 weeks and summer programs are 4–9 weeks. All programs begin with a thorough orientation that incorporates health and safety information and tools for cross-cultural adaptation. Every program is framed around a critical global issue, which provides a lens through which students explore the issue through theory and its local manifestation. Student learning happens through multiple formats — lectures, field visits, language study, homestays, and day-to-day interactions with local communities — in classroom and field-based settings.

SIT students learn to put into practice appropriate field research methods such as participant observation, cultural analysis, interviews, transects, oral histories, and quantitative data collection. They apply tools of investigation and analysis and develop greater curiosity, confidence, and self-awareness.Every program concludes with a guided reflection and discussion period that examines the impact of the experience. Through this reentry preparation, students are encouraged to consider how they can incorporate their experience in the future. During this time, students also have the opportunity to provide feedback on their program.

Even prior to the explosion of the popularity of study abroad SIT was generating effective leaders, professionals, and citizens. SIT has a worldwide network of individuals and organizations committed to responsible global citizenship. Those who have completed SIT programs have an understanding of global issues, such as globalization and development. Students are immersed in language while in country and learn new research methods.

There are also many opportunities for those who have returned.

The '''STEM Education Act of 2014''' ({{USBill|113|hr|5031}}) is a bill that would add [[computer science]] to the definition of [[STEM fields]] used by the United States federal government in determining grants and education funding.&lt;ref name="Callahan1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="5031text"/&gt; It would open up some training programs to teachers pursuing their Master's degrees, not just teachers who had already earned one.&lt;ref name="Callahan1"/&gt;

It was introduced and passed in the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].

==Background==
{{main|STEM fields}}
"STEM" is an [[acronym]] referring to the [[academic discipline]]s of [[science]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], and [[mathematics]].&lt;ref name="fas.org"&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42642.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The term is typically used in the USA when addressing education policy and [[curriculum]] choices in schools from [[k-12]] through college to improve  competitiveness in technology development. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns and immigration policy.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt; In the United States, the acronym began to be used in education and immigration debates in initiatives to begin to address the perceived lack of qualified candidates for high-tech jobs.  It also addresses concern that the subjects are often taught in isolation, instead of as an integrated curriculum.&lt;ref name="STEM PA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iu1stemcenter.org/files/CMU_and_IU_STEM_Survey.pdf |title=STEM Education in Southwestern Pennsylvania |year=2008 |author= |publisher=The Intermediate Unit 1 Center for STEM Education |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining a citizenry that is well versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the [[public education]] agenda of the United States.&lt;ref name="USNEWS2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/stem-education/2012/07/26/us-news-inducts-five-to-stem-leadership-hall-of-fame |title=U.S. News Inducts Five to STEM Leadership Hall of Fame |date=July 26, 2012 |author=Morella, Michael |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the bill==
There are three major components of the bill.&lt;ref name="Callahan1"/&gt;

First, the bill would expand the definition of "STEM education" to include education in the field of [[computer science]].&lt;ref name="IEEEusaSupport"/&gt; This definition is used by [[NASA]], the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], and the [[United States Department of Energy]] in their programs.&lt;ref name=5031text&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 5031 - Text|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/5031/text|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEEusaSupport"/&gt; This would "ensure federal grants and programs related to STEM education include computer science education."&lt;ref name="Callahan1"/&gt;

Second, the bill would confirm the importance of STEM education outside of school.&lt;ref name="Callahan1"/&gt;

A final provision of the bill would make "classroom teachers with bachelor’s degrees in STEM fields who are pursuing master’s degrees eligible for NSF-administered Master Teaching Fellowships in exchange for a four-year commitment to teach in high-need school districts."&lt;ref name="IEEEusaSupport"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The STEM Education Act of 2014 was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on July 8, 2014 by [[Lamar S. Smith|Rep. Lamar Smith (R, TX-21)]].&lt;ref name=5031allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 5031 - All Actions|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/5031/all-actions|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology]]. On July 14, 2014, the House voted to pass the bill in a [[voice vote]].&lt;ref name="5031allactions"/&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE-USA]] supported the bill, with President [[Gary Blank]] saying that "IEEE-USA strongly supports federal, state and local efforts to improve K-12 science, technology, engineering and math education, particularly programs that increase student interest and engagement in engineering and computer science."&lt;ref name=IEEEusaSupport&gt;{{cite web|title=IEEE-USA Commends House of Representatives for Including Computer Science in Passing STEM Education Act|url=https://www.usinnovation.org/news/ieee-usa-commends-house-representatives-including-computer-science-passing-stem-education-act|website=usinnovation.org|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=16 July 2014|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rep. [[Elizabeth Esty]] (D-CT), who co-sponsored the bill, said that "STEM education is critical to preparing our students for high-demand careers in [[engineering]], [[manufacturing]], and [[information technology]]."&lt;ref name=Callahan1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Callahan|first1=Molly|title=House passes Rep. Esty's STEM Education Act|url=http://www.myrecordjournal.com/meriden/meridennews/5036761-129/house-passes-rep-estys-stem-education-act.html|accessdate=16 July 2014|publisher=My Record Journal|date=15 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720202557/http://www.myrecordjournal.com/meriden/meridennews/5036761-129/house-passes-rep-estys-stem-education-act.html|archivedate=20 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Esty, she frequently hears from "manufactures and small business owners that it's increasingly difficult to find workers with the right skill sets to fill the jobs in demand."

Rep. Smith, who introduced the bill, said that "we have to capture and hold the desire of our nation's youth to study science and engineering so they will want to pursue these careers. A health and viable STEM workforce, literate in all STEM subjects including computer science, is critical to American industries. We must work to ensure that students continue to go into these fields so that their ideas can lead to a more innovative and prosperous America."&lt;ref name=CommitPR14&gt;{{cite web|title=House Approves Four Committee Bills|url=http://science.house.gov/press-release/house-approves-four-committee-bills|publisher=House Committee on Science|accessdate=16 July 2014|date=14 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727071453/http://science.house.gov/press-release/house-approves-four-committee-bills|archivedate=27 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sam Adams Award logo.png|150px|right]]

The '''Sam Adams Award''' is given annually to an [[Intelligence agency|intelligence]] professional who has taken a stand for [[integrity]] and ethics. The Award is given by the [[Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sam Adams Award website|url=http://samadamsaward.ch/|publisher=Sam Adams Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; a group of retired [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officers. It is named after [[Samuel A. Adams]], a CIA [[whistleblower]] during the [[Vietnam War]], and takes the physical form of a "corner-brightener candlestick".&lt;ref name=McGovern/&gt;

[[Ray McGovern]] established the Sam Adams Associates "to reward intelligence officials who demonstrated a commitment to truth and integrity, no matter the consequences."&lt;ref name=Motherboard&gt;{{cite web|last=Carlo|first=Silkie|title=Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden Criticize the "Decline" of US Democracy|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/chelsea-manning-and-edward-snowden-criticised-the-decline-of-us-democracy|work=Motherboard|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an educational setting, '''standards-based assessment''' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edglossary.org/standards-based/|title=Standards-Based Definition|last=Partnership|first=Great Schools|date=2014-01-30|work=The Glossary of Education Reform|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;is [[Educational assessment|assessment]] that relies on the evaluation of student understanding with respect to agreed-upon standards, also known as "outcomes". The standards set the criteria for the successful demonstration of the understanding of a concept or skill.&lt;ref name = "unsw"&gt;{{Citation| author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url = https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/standards-based-assessment|title = Standards-Based Assessment|accessdate = February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of standards-based assessment==

In the [[Outcome-based education|standards-based]] paradigm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eleducation.org/resources/chapter-8-standards-based-grading|title=Leaders of Their Own Learning: Chapter 8: Standards-Based Grading {{!}} EL Education|website=eleducation.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;, students have the freedom to demonstrate understanding in diverse ways, including (but not limited to) selected response (e.g. multiple choice tests), physical constructions, written responses, and performances. Of course, these are not new types of assessments, nor is the concept of [[Differentiated instruction|differentiated assessment]]. The teacher uses all available observations and quantitative information to summarize learning with reference to a specific standard. With these data, a teacher can formulate the steps or actions that can be taken to gain mastery of a particular concept. That is, it aids in [[assessment for learning]].

One of the key aspects of standards-based assessment is post-assessment feedback. The feedback a student receives from this type of assessment does not emphasizes a score, percentage, or statistical average, but information about the expectations of performance as compared to the standard. A standards-based approach does not necessarily dismiss a summative grade, percentage, or a measure of central tendency (such as a mean, or median). However, an assessment that does not reference or give feedback with respect to a standard would not be standards-based. There is a large body of evidence that points to the effectiveness of appropriate feedback.&lt;ref name = "power"&gt;{{Citation|author = [[John Hattie]]|url = http://education.qld.gov.au/staff/development/performance/resources/readings/power-feedback.pdf|title = Power of Feedback|accessdate = February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of standards-based assessment==

The purpose of standards-based assessment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.k12academics.com/education-assessment-evaluation/standards-based-assessment|title=Standards-based Assessment {{!}} K12 Academics|last=Glavin|first=Chris|date=2014-02-06|website=www.k12academics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to connect evidence of learning to learning outcomes (the standards). When standards are explicit and clear, the learner becomes aware of his/her achievement with reference to the standards, and the teacher may use assessment data to give meaningful feedback to students about this progress. The awareness of one's own learning allows students to point to a specific standard of achievement and so strengthens self-regulation and meta-cognition, two skills generally understood to be effective learning strategies.&lt;ref name = "metacog"&gt;{{Citation|author = Emily R. Lai|url = http://education.qld.gov.au/staff/development/performance/resources/readings/power-feedback.pdf|title = Metacognition: A Literature Review|accessdate = February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Framework of the standards-based approach in assessment==

A common approach to standards-based assessment (SBA) is:

* Identify a key fact or important body of knowledge (e.g. a scientific theory, a mathematical relationship), the essential content and concepts.
{{quotation | Example from the British Columbia Grade 3 Curriculum Package (September 2010):
:"It is expected that students will view and demonstrate comprehension of visual texts (e.g., cartoons, illustrations, diagrams, posters)"&lt;ref name="bcgr3"&gt;{{citation|author=British Columbia Ministry of Education|title=Grade 3 Curriculum Package|url=https://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/irp/curric_grade_packages/gr3curric_req.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Education, British Columbia|accessdate=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quotation | Example from the New Zealand curriculum document ''Mathematics Standards for Years 1-8'', by the end of year 5:
:"In contexts that require them to solve problems or model situations, students will be able to create, continue, and predict further members of sequential patterns with two variables"&lt;ref name="nzmath1to8"&gt;{{citation |author=New Zealand Ministry of Education|title=Mathematics Standards for Years 1-8|url=https://nzcurriculum.tki.org.nz/content/download/3166/47235/file/Maths_Standards_amended_vs3.pdf|website=New Zealand Curriculum Online|publisher=Ministry of Education|accessdate=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* Identify the indicators (i.e. evidence) that students will show when the concept or content has been understood.
{{quotation | Respectively to the example from the British Columbia Grade 3 Curriculum Package:
:"describe key messages and images and relevant details in response to questions or activities"&lt;ref name="bcgr3" /&gt;}}
* Choose a collection of assessments that will allow students to demonstrate the indicators.
* Using a scale or rubric, identify the proficiency of the student with respect to the standard. This progress is made accessible to the learner in order to provide meaningful feedback. Any feedback should be able to provide information on how the proficiency can be improved&lt;ref name="power" /&gt;) and the educator needs to be aware of the effects of praise during feedback.&lt;ref name="APAUsingPraise"&gt;{{citation |author=Carol Dwyer|title=Using Praise to Enhance Student Resilience and Learning Outcomes|url=http://www.apa.org/education/k12/using-praise.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Repeat instruction, assessment and feedback until the student achieves a predetermined level of mastery.

==Hallmarks of standards-based assessment==

* Standards (i.e. learning outcomes) need to be visible and understandable by students
* Tasks, activities and assessments should be clear about which standard is being practiced
* [[Formative assessment]] should be used to give feedback to students about their progress towards a standard
* Assessment in general should be well-designed, accurate and high in [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] to be fair and accessible
* [[Exemplar theory|Exemplars]] should be used to give students an understanding of how achievement against a standard is measured
* [[Rubric (academic)|Rubrics]] should be used to assess performances and constructed responses&lt;ref name = "rubrics"&gt;{{Citation|author = Susan M. Brookhart|url =  http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/112001/chapters/What-Are-Rubrics-and-Why-Are-They-Important%C2%A2.aspx|title = How to Create and Use Rubrics for Formative Assessment and Grading|accessdate = February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Selective response (e.g. multiple choice) should be used to assess basic understanding and knowledge (as in [[Bloom's Taxonomy]]) of a specific standard (or the underlying pre-requisite concepts associated with the standard)

==Geographical Distinctions==

===United States===

A '''standards-based test''' is an assessment based on the outcome-based education or performance-based education philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news-bulletin.com/news/58020-01-18-06.html] January 18, 2006 Standards- Based Test draws plan for awareness
Jackie Schlotfeldt News-Bulletin Staff Writer Valencia County News-Bulletin "With the New Mexico Standards Based Assessments just a little over a month away"&lt;/ref&gt;  Assessment is a key part of  the standards reform movement. The first part is to set new, higher standards to be expected of every student. Then the curriculum must be aligned to the new standards. Finally, the student must be assessed if they meet these standards of what every student "must know and be able to do". In the United States, a high school diploma which is given on passing a [[high school graduation examination]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.k12academics.com/standardized-testing/national-achievement-tests/high-school-graduation-examination|title=High School Graduation Examination {{!}} K12 Academics|last=Glavin|first=Chris|date=2014-02-06|website=www.k12academics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Certificate of Initial Mastery]] is awarded only when these standards are achieved. It is fully expected that every child will become proficient in all areas of academic skills by the end of a period, typically 10 years in the United States, but sometimes longer, after the passing of education reform bill by a state legislature. The United States federal government, under [[No Child Left Behind]] can further require that all schools must demonstrate improvement among all students, even if they are already all over proficient.

====Holistic grading====
Rather than using computers to log responses to multiple choice tests, [[rubrics (education)|rubrics]] for  state assessments such as in North Carolina &lt;ref&gt;AFT - Hot Topics - Standards-Based Reform  North Carolina Focused Holistic Scoring Guide: The Expository Composition Grade 7, [http://www.aft.org/topics/sbr/NC.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; ask scorers to look at the entire paper and make judgments. Scorers are not allowed to count errors, and rubrics do not contain numeric measurements of how many spelling or grammar error constitute a "1" or "2". The Analytical Writing section of the [[Graduate Record Examination|GRE]] test is scored using a six-point holistic scale in half-point increments.&lt;ref&gt;GRE Update - March 2006 The Analytical Writing section of the General Test will continue to be scored using the six-point holistic scale in half-point increments [http://www.ets.org/Media/Newsletters/GRE/2006/0601_scale.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Holistic grading is one of the main reason for disagreement between scorers, but for this reason some tests are scored more than once to check for agreement.

====Advantages of Standards-based Assessment====
* Students are compared to a standard that all can reach, rather than artificially ranked into a [[Grading on a curve|bell curve]] where some students must be called failures, and only a few are allowed to ''succeed''
* Humans, not computers can evaluate the entire value of a response rather than imposing a strict right or wrong that is not open to interpretation
* Free response uses and tests for [[higher order thinking skills|higher order thinking]], which is important in most new [[education standards]].
* Computer scored [[multiple choice]] tests have been shown to have deleterious effects for minorities, unfairly denying opportunities.
* Only a standards-based test is aligned with standards-based education reform, which is based on a belief that all students can succeed, not only a few.
* Passing a 10th grade test and awarding a Certificate of Initial Mastery ensures that all students will graduate with the skills they need to succeed in the world-class economy of the twenty-first century.
* Students will no longer be cheated by passing them on to the next grade without obtaining what every child at the grade level must be able to know and do.
* When all students pass all standards, as is the central belief of [[standards-based education reform]], all students from all demographics will achieve the same  test score, eliminating the mysterious [[achievement gap]] which has previously been shown to occur between all groups on all tests. However, as of 2006, no standards-based assessment has yet achieved this optimistic (critics might call it impossible) goal, though many show rising scores.

====Cons====
Compared to a multiple-choice, [[norm-referenced test]], a standards-based test can be recognized by:

* A cut score is determined for different levels of performance. There are no cut scores for norm-referenced tests. There is no failing score on the [[SAT|SAT test]]. Each college or institution sets their own score standards for admission or awards.
* Different levels of performance are set. Typically these are Above Standard, Meets Standard, Below Standard. These levels a typically set in a benchmarking process, even though such a process does not take into an account whether the test items are even appropriate for the grade level.
* Tests are [[Holistic grading|holistically graded]] against a free-written response, often with pictures, rather than graded correct or incorrect among multiple choices.
* Tests are more expensive to grade because of this, typically $25–30 per test compared to $2–$5, not including the cost of developing the test, typically different every year for every state.
* Tests are more difficult to grade because they are typically graded against a handful with no more than one or two example papers at each scoring level. They cannot be graded by computer
* Tests are less reliable. Agreement may fall between 60 and 80 percent on a 4-point scale and be considered to be accurate.
* Graders do not need teaching credentials, only a bachelor's degree in any field, and are typically paid $8 to $11 per hour for part-time work.
* Failure rates as high as 80 to 95 percent are not only not unusual, they are fully expected and announced as test programs are introduced to the local press. Under traditional graduation criteria, African Americans had achieved national graduation rates within a few points of whites. In 2006, three-quarters of African Americans who failed the [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]] were promised by Superintendent [[Terry Bergeson]] that they would not get a diploma if they did not pass retakes of the test in two years, even though she had pledged earlier that "all students" would get a world class diploma.
* Failure rates for minorities and special education students are typically two to four times higher than for majority groups as extended response questions are more difficult to answer than multiple choice
* Content is often difficult even for adults to quickly answer, even at grade levels as low as the fourth grade, especially in mathematics. Professor [[Don Orlich]] called the [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]] a "disaster", with math and science tests falling well above the normal development level of students at many grade levels.
* Mathematics has a high proportion of statistics and geometry, and a low content of simple arithmetic.
* Schools are scored as zero for students who do not take the test.
* Passing such a test at the 10th grade level is typically planned as being required for graduating high school.
* Passing such a test, rather than the 50th percentile, is defined as [[Educational stages|grade level]] performance.
* A question with a correct answer may be graded as incorrect if it does not show how the answer as arrived at. A question with an incorrect numerical conclusion may not necessarily be graded as wrong.&lt;ref&gt;1997 WASL math released problems&lt;/ref&gt;
* California's first year of the CLAS test permitted no '4' high math grades, not even in the highest scoring schools, in order to leave room for improvement&lt;ref&gt;testimony of Maureen DiMarco to Washington State legislators&lt;/ref&gt;
* The North Carolina Writing project gave out less than 1 percent exemplary '4' scores. Such papers employed vocabulary and knowledge on a level sometimes exceeding that of the college graduate graders, and well above the intended audience of a high school graduation.&lt;ref&gt;At a grading session in Auburn in 2004, no graders could identify some of the words used in some papers&lt;/ref&gt; This level would be even more difficult than achieving an SAT score sufficient for entry into an Ivy League private college.
* Scores typically rise much faster than standardized tests such as NAEP or SAT given over the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;Rand study of Kentucky KIRIS&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanwood Cobb''' (November 6, 1881 – December 29, 1982) was an American educator, author and prominent [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] of the 20th century.

He was born in [[Newton, Massachusetts]] to Darius Cobb - a Civil War soldier, artist and descendent of Elder Henry Cobb of the second voyage of the [[Mayflower]] - and [[Eunice Hale Waite Cobb]] - founding president of the [[Ladies Physiological Institute]] of [[Boston]] and grandmother of Cobb's four sisters and two other brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vccMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA73&amp;dq=%22stanwood+cobb%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1#PRA2-PA71,M1 ''The Register of the Malden Historical Society''] Vol 6, 1919-20 by Mass Malden Historical Society, Frank S.

In 1907–1910, Cobb taught history and Latin at [[Robert College]] in [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]), followed by several years teaching in the US and Europe.&lt;ref name="oates"/&gt; He later headed the English department at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] (1914–15), taught at [[Asheville School]] in [[Asheville, North Carolina]] (1915–16), and was instructor of history and English at the [[United States Naval Academy]] (1916–19).&lt;ref name="oates"/&gt; Frustrated by the teaching experience at the Academy, Cobb heard a lecture by [[Marietta Johnson]] who helped marshal and crystallize his thoughts on education practice and [[curriculum theory]].&lt;ref name="emery"&gt;[http://www.educationanddemocracy.org/Emery/Emery_AltSchoolsPaper.htm Alternative Schools: Diverted but not Defeated]  Paper submitted to Qualification Committee, At UC Davis, California,  July 2000, By Kathy Emery&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in 1919, Cobb founded the [[Chevy Chase Country Day School]], of which he was the principal until his retirement,&lt;ref name="oates"/&gt; and, active in the [[progressive education]] movement in the [[United States]], became a founder and motivating force,&lt;ref name="emery"/&gt; first secretary, and eventually president (1927–1930)&lt;ref name="oates"/&gt; of '''The Association for the Advancement of Progressive Education''', later renamed in 1931 as [[Progressive Education Association]] (PEA) and then '''American Education Fellowship'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of American Education'' ed. by Richard J.

==Life as a Bahá'í==
After looking at [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Reform Judaism]] and other themes in religion&lt;ref name="rest"&gt;''Restless Souls: The Making of American Spirituality'' by Leigh Schmidt Cobb, published by HarperCollins, 2005, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb investigated the Bahá'í Faith after a series of articles in the [[News-Transcript Group|Boston Transcript]] on the religion attracted his attention. He pursued the interest to [[Green Acre]] conference center in [[Eliot, Maine]] in 1906 during his studies at [[Harvard Divinity School]] seeking to be a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]]. [[Sarah Farmer]] much affected Cobb&lt;ref name="rest"/&gt; and [[Thornton Chase]] was giving a series of talks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/notes/vol2/chs.1906.html Minutes of the House of Spirituality,  1 Sept. 1906]&lt;/ref&gt; It was on that occasion that he became a Bahá'í.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;

Between 1909 and 1913 he met with [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] five times (twice in [[Acre, Israel|Akka]] and several times during the latter's travel to Europe and the US).&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://iamanaref.blogspot.com/2007/08/corrections-to-blog-on-stanwood-cobb-no.html McLean, J.A., ''Pilgrim's Notes'' (blog), "Corrections to Blog on Stanwood Cobb...," Sunday, August 12, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 Cobb and a number of others gave talks in honor of the personal invitation by `Abdu'l-Bahá to pilgrimage of [[Louis George Gregory|Louis Gregory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/louisggregory/History.html Biography of Hand of the Cause of God Mr. Louis George Gregory]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobb was a founding member of the [[Spiritual Assembly]] of the Baha'is of Washington D. C. in 1933, and served on various committees (for example Cobb was Chairman of the Teaching Committee in 1935&lt;ref&gt;''Alain Locke: Faith and Philosophy'' by Christopher Buck, Studies in Babí and Bahá'í Religions  - Volume 18, p.168&lt;/ref&gt;) and edited two Baha'i journals: [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] in 1924, and [[World Order (journal)|World Order]] from 1935-39.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7482">'''Text over IP''' (or '''ToIP''') is a means of providing a [[real-time text]] (RTT) service that operates over IP-based networks. It complements Voice over IP ([[VoIP]]) and Video over IP.

Real-time text is streaming text that is transmitted as it is produced, allowing text to be used conversationally. Real-time text is defined in ITU-T Multimedia Recommendation F.700 2.1.2.1 . Real-time text is designed for conversational use where people interactively converse with each other. To achieve this, particular user requirements have been specified for the delay of each character and the character loss rate (see F.700 Annex A.3).

Real-time Text over IP can be used:
*in conjunction with voice or video in a multimedia communication or on its own, on fixed or mobile accesses,
* by people who want a fast and really interactive means of conversing,
* in noisy environments where it may be hard to hear,
* in environments where other people are nearby but where communications privacy is required,
* to transfer information (e.g., numbers, addresses, etc.) where exactness is necessary,
* by people with hearing loss or speech impairments to communicate with non-disabled and deaf or hard of hearing or speech impaired people.
* to provide real time captioning of a voice conversation for people with a hearing loss. See also captioned telephony in [[Telecommunications Relay Service]]
* to provide all voice callers with a convenient means to accurately pass numbers, addresses and other detailed information in text.

== Features==
ToIP is designed around the ITU-T T.140 real-time text presentation layer protocol (defined for H.32x multimedia services).  T.140 allows real-time editing of text e.g. by using 'backspace' and retyping. T.140 is based on the ISO 10646-1 character set that is used by most IP text specifications and uses the UTF-8 format. 

Transport of ToIP uses the same [[Real-time Transport Protocol]] (RTP) as [[VoIP]] and Video-over-IP. The text is encoded according to IETF RFC 4103 "RTP Payload for Text Conversation".  

RFC 4103 supports an optional forward error correction scheme based on redundant transmission (using RFC 2198). This results in a very low end-to-end packet loss across IP transmission links that have moderately high packet loss. To improve efficiency, text can be buffered for 0.3 – 0.5 seconds before it is sent whilst still meeting the delay requirements. 

RTP is usually transported over the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP). However, because 2.5G mobile networks supported the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) but did not consistently support UDP, some implementations of ToIP over mobile networks use TCP internally. 3G mobile networks can support UDP. 

The protocol stack for a ToIP medium is: 

{| class="wikitable"
|   T.140
|-
| RFC4103
|-
| RTP
|-
| UDP (TCP)
|-
| IP
|-
|}

Very fast typing (30 characters per second) results in a two kilobit per second traffic load (including overheads for RFC4103 with the maximum level of redundancy, RTP, UDP and IP).

Control of ToIP sessions has been defined using the standard [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) (RFC 3261) and the [[Session Description Protocol]] (SDP) (RFC 4566) protocols. 
* SIP is used without any alteration.
* Real-time text encoding is identified by using the SDP media definition 'm=text'.
* The 3GPP IMS defines the features of SDP that ToIP uses in 3GPP TS 26.114 v7.4.0 A5

See IETF '''RFC 5194''' "Framework for real-time text over IP using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" and IETF '''RFC 4504''' "SIP Telephony Device Requirements and Configuration" Section 2.9 for more information.

==Deployment==
[[Next Generation Networking]] (NGNs) is a concept developed by telecommunication service providers and their suppliers. It aims to create a true multi-service network based in IP technology. 

ToIP has been specified for inclusion in the 3GPP [[IP Multimedia Subsystem]] (IMS) (in 3GPP TS 26.114 v2.0.0 "IMS, Multimedia Telephony, Media handling and interaction"). IMS is being used to implement NGNs in many fixed and mobile networks. 

Support of ToIP is being considered in multimedia Emergency [[Public-safety answering point]] (PSAPs) in Europe and USA. The ECRIT IETF working group defines ToIP as one form of access to Emergency Services. 

ToIP can provide a 'low impact' solution to meeting national regulatory requirements to provide 'equivalent service' to the telephone service for people who have hearing or speech impairments. 

A typical terminal on a fixed line access is a home computer that supports multimedia communications - Voice and Video and real-time Text over IP. See External links for information about ToIP equipment and software.

==Use by Deaf and hard-of-hearing people==
[[Telecommunications device for the deaf]] (TDD) or TTYs (also called Textphone or minicoms) were designed to transport real-time text over the PSTN. TDDs use a range of modem technologies.
  
Text-over-IP has been designed as a replacement for TDDs when using the IP-based networks  but also to be of use to mainstream voice call users. It has less service restrictions compared with TDDs, is designed to be used as a mainstream service and can be used on standard computers or mobile terminals. Proper alerting systems for incoming calls need to be included as well as user interfaces, both hardware and software, that meet the needs of Deaf people, and people with hearing or speech impairments. This can best be achieved with input from end-users in the development stages.

Interworking between TDDs and ToIP has been implemented using gateways by T-Meeting, Omnitor, Trace R&amp; D, RNID, Center, Voiceriver, and AnnieS. '''RFC 5194''' "Framework for real-time text over IP using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" provides an overview of interworking issues. Work is being proposed in the IETF SIPPING work group on more detailed interworking based on a range of call scenarios.

'''''The Ordeal of Richard Feverel: A History of Father and Son''''' ([[1859 in literature|1859]]) is the earliest full-length novel by [[George Meredith]]; its subject is the inability of systems of education to control human passions.  It is one of a select group of standard texts that have been included in all four of [[Everyman's Library]] (1935), the [[New American Library]] of World Literature (1961), [[Oxford World's Classics]] (1984), and [[Penguin Classics]] (1998).  With its rigorous psychological analysis and criticism of contemporary attitudes to sexuality, it has been seen by some critics as the first modern novel in English literature.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Tucker (ed.) ''The Critical Temper: A Survey of Modern Criticism on English and American Literature From the Beginnings to the Twentieth Century'' (New York: Ungar, 1969–1989) vol. 4, p. 449; Donald D. Stone ''Novelists in a Changing World: Meredith, James, and the Transformation of English Fiction in the 1880's'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1972) p. 102; Richard C. Stevenson ''The Experimental Impulse in George Meredith's Fiction'' (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 2004) p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

Sir Austin Feverel's wife deserts him to run away with a poet, leaving her husband to bring up their boy Richard.  Believing schools to be corrupt, Sir Austin, a [[Secular humanism|scientific humanist]], educates the boy at home with a plan of his own devising known as "the System".  This involves strict authoritarian supervision of every aspect of the boy's life, and in particular the prevention of any meeting between Richard and girls of his own age.  Richard nevertheless meets and falls in love with Lucy Desborough, the niece of a neighboring farmer.  Sir Austin finds out and, disapproving of her humble birth, forbids them to meet again, but they secretly marry.  Sir Austin now tries to retrieve the situation by sending Richard to London.  Here, however, Sir Austin's friend Lord Mountfalcon successfully sets a courtesan to seduce Richard, hoping that this will leave Lucy open to seduction by himself.  Ashamed of his own conduct, Richard flees abroad where he at length hears that Lucy has given birth to a baby and has been reconciled to Sir Austin.  He returns to England and, hearing about Lord Mountfalcon's villainy, challenges him to a duel.  But this goes badly:  Richard is seriously wounded.  Lucy is so overcome by this turn of events that she loses her mind and dies.

== Origins ==

In 1856 George Meredith's wife Mary began an affair with the artist [[Henry Wallis]].  In the following year, pregnant by Wallis, she ran away to join him, leaving her son Arthur behind.  Meredith undertook to bring the child up.  The parallels with the opening chapters of the novel are obvious, though Sir Austin is certainly not intended as a self-portrait.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Matthew|H. C. G. Matthew]] and [[Brian Harrison (historian)|Brian Harrison]] (eds.) ''The Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004) vol. 37, pp. 862–863.&lt;/ref&gt; Meredith was equivocal in his attitude to Sir Austin's favourite educational theories, which, it has been shown, derived largely from the medical writer [[William Acton (doctor)|William Acton]]'s ''Prostitution, Considered in Its Moral, Social &amp; Sanitary Aspects'' (1857) and ''The Functions and Disorders of the Reproductive Organs'' (1857), from [[Herbert Spencer]]'s essay "Moral Education" (''Quarterly Review'', April 1858), and from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s novel ''[[Emile: or, On Education|Émile]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Mendelson (ed.) ''The Ordeal of Richard Feverel'' (London: Penguin, 1998) pp. xvi–xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

''The Ordeal of Richard Feverel'' was first published in 1859 by [[Chapman &amp; Hall]] in three volumes.  The book received generally respectful reviews, though critics were often puzzled by Meredith's rather dense style, and did not all agree in their reading of the book's message, or their estimation of the author's success in presenting it.&lt;ref&gt;Ioan Meredith (ed.) ''George Meredith: The Critical Heritage'' (London: Routledge, 1996) pp. 61–85.&lt;/ref&gt; The book's commercial success, as with all Victorian novels, depended in large measure on the number of copies bought by the various commercial lending libraries, but the largest of them all, [[Charles Edward Mudie|Mudie's]], took fright at the sexual frankness of the novel and refused to stock it, casting a taint of unrespectability over Meredith's name that lasted for many years.  "I am tabooed from all decent drawing-room tables", Meredith wrote, but he refused to tone down the offending passages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Matthew|H. C. G. Matthew]] and [[Brian Harrison (historian)|Brian Harrison]] (eds.) ''The Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004) vol. vol. 37, pp. 862–863.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chapman &amp; Hall left the book unreprinted for nearly twenty years, and when in 1878 Meredith produced a revised (but not bowdlerized) version it was published by another firm, Kegan Paul.  From the mid-1880s onward Meredith's reputation as a serious novelist reached such a level as to ensure a stream of reprints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://copac.ac.uk/search?au=george+meredith&amp;ti=the+ordeal+of+richard+feverel&amp;sort-order=date Catalogue entry] at [[Copac]].&lt;/ref&gt; For the past hundred years ''Richard Feverel'', with all its faults, has been considered one of Meredith's finest works, its status as a forerunner of many later developments in the novel being widely recognized.  [[Arnold Bennett]] wrote, "In ''Richard Feverel'', what a loosening of the bonds!  What a renaissance!…It was the announcer of a sort of dawn", while acknowledging that "It is a weak book, full of episodic power and overloaded with wit." &lt;ref&gt;Sharon K. Hall and Dennis Poupard (eds.) ''Twentieth-Century Literary Criticism'' (Detroit: Gale Research, 1985) vol. 17, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[J. B. Priestley]] wrote that "So far as English fiction is concerned...there can be no doubt that the modern novel began with the publication of ''The Ordeal of Richard Feverel''." &lt;ref&gt;Martin Tucker (ed.) ''The Critical Temper: A Survey of Modern Criticism on English and American Literature From the Beginnings to the Twentieth Century'' (New York: Ungar, 1969-1989) vol. 4, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia Woolf]]'s assessment was that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He makes no attempt to preserve the sober reality of [[Anthony Trollope|Trollope]] and [[Jane Austen]]; he has destroyed all the usual staircases by which we have learnt to climb. And what is done so deliberately is done with a purpose. This defiance of the ordinary, these airs and graces, the formality of the dialogue with its Sirs and Madams are all there to create an atmosphere that is unlike that of daily life, to prepare the way for a new and an original sense of the human scene.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And again:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The book is cracked through and through with those fissures which come when the author seems to be of twenty minds at the same time. Yet it succeeds in holding miraculously together, not certainly by the depths and originality of its character drawing but by the vigour of its intellectual power and by its lyrical intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon K. Hall and Dennis Poupard (eds.) ''Twentieth-Century Literary Criticism'' (Detroit: Gale Research, 1985) vol. 17, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
''The Ordeal of Richard Feverel'' is referenced in [[E.M. Forster]]'s 1910 novel ''[[Howards End]]''. The aspirational character Leonard Bast mentions that it inspired him to leave London and take an all night walk into the countryside, because he "wanted to get back to the earth...like Richard does in the end."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Howards End| author=E.M. Forster| p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was referenced again in the [[Merchant-Ivory]] [[Howards End (film)|adaptation]] of ''Howards End'', in which Leonard discreetly reads a passage from ''Richard Feverel'' at his work and dreams of walking in a bluebell wood. Helen later reads the passage out loud when Leonard mentions it as his inspiration for his all-night walk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title=Howards End| medium=dvd| year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These educational programs and institutions have been founded in the USA, United Kingdom, Australia, India, Africa and Japan. The Transcendental Meditation technique became popular with students in the 1960s and by the early 1970s centers for the Students International Meditation Society were established at a thousand campuses&lt;ref name="Olson-Encyclopedia"/&gt; in the USA with similar growth occurring in Germany, Canada and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Bainbridge, William Sims (1997 Routledge, ''The Sociology of Religious Movements'', page 188&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Maharishi University of Management|Maharishi International University]] was established in 1973 in the USA and began offering accredited, degree programs.

==History of school programs==

===1965 to 1979===
The Students' International Meditation Society (SIMS) incorporated in 1965/1966 and focused on offering the TM technique to students and faculty at schools and universities.&lt;ref name=Chryssides&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Chryssides | first1 = George D. | title = Exploring new religions | year = 1999 | publisher = Cassell | location = London | isbn = 978-0-8264-5959-6 | pages = 293–296| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jxIxPBpGMwgC&amp;pg=PA293&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UCLA]] (University of California, Los Angeles) chapter had 1,000 members and was co-founded by researcher and physiologist, Robert Keith Wallace, the first president of [[Maharishi International University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transcendental Idea to Meditate About|first=JEAN|last=MURPHY|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 9, 1968|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1974, 14 states had encouraged local schools to teach TM in the classroom, and it was taught at 50 universities.&lt;ref name=Fair&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rj4sAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=C80EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7098,3098882&amp;dq=transcendental-meditation+public-schools&amp;hl=en |last=Fair |first=Gloria|title=Transcendental Meditation is not anything like it sounds|work=Spartansburg Herald-Journal|date=August 14, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the public school systems where TM was taught were [[Shawnee Mission, Kansas]],&lt;ref name=Hendel&gt;''Hendel v World Plan Executive Council'', 124 WLR 957 (January 2, 1996); ''affd'' 705 A.2d 656, 667 (DC, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maplewood, New Jersey|Maplewood]], [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], [[Union Hill, Morris County, New Jersey|Union Hill]] and [[West New York]], [[New Jersey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vMETAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=M-ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6723,5132687&amp;dq=transcendental-meditation+public-schools&amp;hl=en|agency=AP|title=New Jersey court bans TM courses|work=Eugene Register-Guard|date=October 20, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eastchester, New York]]&lt;ref name=Fair/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarasota Herald"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NRAzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mGYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5803,3090100&amp;dq=transcendental-meditation+public-schools&amp;hl=en |last=Irwin|first=T.K. |title=What's new in science – Transcendental Meditation: Medical miracle or 'another kooky fad'?|work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=October 8, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[North York, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YIAyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=N7cFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3106,5351776&amp;dq=transcendental-meditation+public-schools&amp;hl=en|last=Somerville|first=Barbara|title=To another state of being|work=Palm Beach Post|date=September 13, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was described as a "phenomenal success"&lt;ref name=Woo&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-maharishi6feb06,1,4208394.story|last=Woo|first=Elaine|title=Maharishi Mahesh Yogi|work=Los Angeles Times|date=February 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Feb 7, 2008) Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, ''The Times'', London&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to function in some countries including the U.S.A.&lt;ref name=Chryssides/&gt;&lt;ref name=SIMS&gt;SIMS New Zealand [http://www.sims.org.nz/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524232340/http://www.sims.org.nz/ |date=May 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 33-lesson video course called the Science of Creative Intelligence was offered at universities such as [[Stanford]], [[Yale]], the [[University of Colorado]], the [[University of Wisconsin]], and [[Oregon State University]].&lt;ref name="Sarasota Herald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maharishi.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maharishi.org/sci/sci.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sSZzYK4U|archivedate=September 2, 2010|title=The Science of Creative Intelligence Course|publisher=maharishi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the [[Third Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed the 1977 decision of the [[US District Court]] of New Jersey that a course in Transcendental Meditation and the Science of Creative Intelligence (SCI) was religious activity within the meaning of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and that the government funded teaching of SCI/TM in the New Jersey public high schools was prohibited.&lt;ref name="conlaw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="malnak"/&gt; The court ruled that, although SCI/TM is not a theistic religion, it deals with issues of ultimate concern, truth, and other ideas analogous to those in well-recognized religions. The court found that the religious nature of the course was clear from careful examination of the textbook, the expert testimony elicited, and the uncontested facts concerning the puja ceremony, which it found involved "offerings to deities as part of a regularly scheduled course in the schools' educational programs".&lt;ref&gt;The TM puja ceremony is described in the opinion of the US District Court in Malnak v Yogi, including the [[Sanskrit]] chant and the English translation thereof from the book "The Holy Tradition", written by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.&lt;/ref&gt; State action was involved because the SCI/TM course and activities involved the teaching of a religion, without an objective secular purpose.&lt;ref name="malnak" /&gt; According to religious scholar [[Cynthia Ann Humes]] the ''Malnak'' decision "dismantled" the TM program's use of government funding to incorporate Transcendental Meditation into public schools.&lt;ref name=Forsthoefel/&gt; However, according to religious scholars [[Douglas E. Cowan]] and [[David G. Bromley]] this "judicial rebuff" of the New Jersey school project did not render "a negative evaluation of the program itself" and those who oppose the practice in public schools are said to be mainly conservative Christians and civil libertarians who seek to preserve church-state separation.&lt;ref name="Cowan 2008 70"/&gt;

Since 1979, schools and universities in the U.S. and abroad have introduced the Transcendental Meditation technique using private, non-governmental funding. The technique has been introduced on a voluntary basis, with parental consent, and teachers and parents are taught the meditation before the students learn.&lt;ref name=Conant/&gt;&lt;ref name=IDS/&gt; Often referred to as the Quiet Time Program, the students and teachers meditate for 10 to 20 minutes twice per day.&lt;ref name=IDS&gt;[http://www.idsnews.com/news/story.aspx?id=81433] Indiana Daily Student, Meditation in Schools, Paige Henry, April 28, 2011, Retrieved April 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="download.tmnews.org"&gt;[http://download.tmnews.org/2006_05_05_ProvidenceJournal.pdf TM News]&lt;/ref&gt; The program consists of TM instruction and follow-up, as well as training of school faculty and staff to supervise the TM sessions offered at the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/grants.html |title=David Lynch Foundation, Official Website, School Grants page |publisher=Davidlynchfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of South Carolina]] sociologist Barry Markovsky described the TM technique in schools as "stealth religion",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtrnews.com/greater-tulsa-reporter/753/once-grand-camelot-hotel-had-a-quick-demise ''Man Fails To Fly, Sues Camelot Hotel Owner''], ''GTR News Online'', Nancy K. Owens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barry W. Lynn]], executive director of [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], says Transcendental Meditation is rooted in Hinduism and crosses the same constitutional line as in the ''Malnak'' case and decision of 1979. Since then, however, "TM has made a comeback of sorts with some governmental sponsorship" according to authors Forsthoefel and Humes.{{sfn|Forsthoefel|2005|p=66}} In May 2008, Lynn said that the Americans United for Separation of Church and State was keeping "a close legal eye on the TM movement" and "there are no imminent cases" against the movement.&lt;ref name=Conant/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newsweek08/&gt; At the same time, Brad Dacus of the [[Pacific Justice Institute]] says doing Transcendental Meditation during a school's "quiet time" (a short period of school time for private prayer or relaxation) "is constitutional."&lt;ref name="Conant2008-05-29"/&gt;
