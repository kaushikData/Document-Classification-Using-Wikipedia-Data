'''Altmann &amp; Kühne'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/austria/vienna/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654669601 Altmann &amp; Kühne] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201200212/http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/austria/vienna/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654669601 |date=2008-02-01 }}, Review, ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[confectionery|confiserie]] and [[chocolaterie]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], established in 1928. It produces handmade chocolates and [[bonbon]]s with a special [[packaging]] designed by [[Wiener Werkstätte]]. It is located in the [[Innere Stadt]], at [[Graben, Vienna|Graben]] 30.

==In Vienna==

The business, which advertised itself as a supplier to the former [[Habsburg Monarchy|Imperial Court]], successfully grew during the [[interwar period]]. It expanded to three downtown locations. The flagship store on the [[Graben, Vienna|Graben]] featured a novel [[modernist architecture|modernist]] facade designed by Josef Hofmann. It survived to date and is a [[listed building]]. Inside the store, the chocolates packages featured modernist designs by the artists of [[Wiener Werkstätte]] school.&lt;ref name=HIS/&gt;

By the time of the [[Anschluss]] of 1938, Altmann and Kühne was Vienna's fourth chocolatier - a "smaller but upscale producer" trailing after the "big three" of Victor Schmidt, Heller and Küfferle.&lt;ref name=S193&gt;Szogui, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Nazi takeover Emile Altmann and Ernst Kühne, who were Jewish, fled to New York City.&lt;ref name=N1/&gt; The business survived through [[Austria in the time of National Socialism|the Nazi years]] and World War II owing to the persistence of their employee, Mrs. Mercek.&lt;ref name=HIS&gt;''[http://www.confiserie-altmann-kuehne.at/index.php?article_id=11&amp;clang=0 History (in German)]''. Altmann &amp; Kühne. Retrieved 2010-08-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==

In December 1939 established a chocolate outlet at 700, [[Fifth Avenue]].&lt;ref name=N1&gt;''[https://www.nytimes.com/1939/12/03/archives/hotel-store-and-apartment-properties-figuring-in-manhattan-real.html?sq=Altmann%2520Kuhne&amp;scp=19&amp;st=cse Hotel, Store and Apartment Properties...]''.

The New York Times, April 9, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Betsy Wade of The New York Times recounted in 1987: "... those chocolates in European-looking packages: the coffee beans for the adults - in theory at least - and the cats' tongues, finger-length spatulas of bittersweet, for me and my sister."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/15/magazine/holiday-surprises-candy-the-way-it-used-to-be.html?scp=3&amp;sq=Altmann%20Kuhne&amp;st=cse Holiday Surprises: Candy as it used to be]''. The New York Times, November 15, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; After Altmann and Kühne left the New York stage, their Fifth Avenue store was rebranded ''Blum{{'s}}'' and continued selling chocolates "perhaps among the finest made in this country".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.nytimes.com/1958/03/03/archives/sweet-tooth-150-can-be-spent-for-four-pounds-of-chocolates-at-new.html?sq=Altmann%2520Kuhne&amp;scp=12&amp;st=cse Sweet Tooth; $150 Can Be Spent for Four Pounds of Chocolates at New 5th Ave. Shop]''. The New York Times, March 3, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group of former Altmann and Kühne employees who emigrated to the United States in 1938, founded the Barton's Candy Corporation, selling ''Continental Chocolates'' brand modelled after original Altmann and Kühne products. This American business eventually expanded into a chain of three thousand outlets.&lt;ref name=S193/&gt;

'''Backpacking''' is the outdoor recreation of carrying gear on one's back, while [[hiking]] for more than a day. It is often but not always an extended journey,&lt;ref&gt;"Travel or hike carrying one's belongings in a backpack: [e.g.] a week's backpacking in the [[Pyrenees]], [or] he has backpacked around the world" (''New Oxford American Dictionary'').&lt;/ref&gt; and may or may not involve [[camping]] outdoors. In North America tenting is common, where simple shelters and [[mountain hut]]s widely found in Europe are rare. In New Zealand, [[Tramping in New Zealand|tramping]] is the term applied though overnight huts are frequently used.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Orsman, ''The Dictionary of New Zealand English''. Auckland: Oxford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hill walking]] is an equivalent in Britain (but this can also refer to a day walk), though backpackers make use of all kinds of accommodation, in addition to camping. Backpackers use simple huts in South Africa.&lt;ref name="footprint.co.za"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footprint.co.za/Development_introduction.htm|title=Trail Development|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar terms used in other countries are trekking and [[bushwalking]].

Backpacking [[backpacking (travel)|as a method of travel]] is a different activity, which mainly utilizes [[public transport]] during a journey which can last months.

==Definition==
[[File:Pocosin cabin.jpg|thumb|left|The Pocosin cabin along the [[Appalachian trail]] in [[Shenandoah National Park]] ]]
Backpacking is an [[outdoor recreation]] where gear is carried in a [[backpack]]. This can include food, water, bedding, shelter, clothing, stove, and cooking kit. Weight is necessarily key. Backpacking trips range from one night to weeks or months, sometimes aided by planned resupply points or drops.

==Accommodations==
Backpacking camps are usually more spartan than campsites where gear is transported by car or boat. In areas with heavy backpacker traffic, a hike-in campsite might have a [[fire ring]] (where permissible), an [[outhouse]], a wooden bulletin board with a [[map]] and information about the trail and area. Many hike-in camps are no more than level patches of ground free of underbrush. In remote [[wilderness]] areas hikers must choose their own site. Established camps are rare and the ethos is to "leave no trace" when gone.

[[File:Tent at High Shelf Camp.jpg|thumb|A backpacker's modern lightweight dome tent near [[Mount Anne]] in a [[Tasmanian Wilderness]] area]]
In some regions, varying forms of accommodation exist, from simple log lean-to's to staffed facilities offering escalating degrees of service. Beds, meals, and even drinks may be had at [[Alps|Alpine]] [[mountain hut|hut]]s scattered among well-traveled European mountains. Backpackers there can walk from hut-to-hut without leaving the mountains, while in places like the [[Lake District]] or [[Yorkshire Dales]] in England hill-walkers descend to stay in [[Youth hostel]]s, farmhouses or [[guest house]]s.

In the more remote parts of Great Britain, especially Scotland, [[bothy|bothies]] exist to provide simple (free) accommodation for backpackers. On the French system of [[long distance trail]]s, ''[[Grande Randonnée]]''s, backpackers can stay in ''gîtes d'etapes'', which are simple hostels provided for walkers and cyclists. There are some simple shelters and occasional mountain hut also provided in North America, including on the [[Appalachian trail]]. Another example is the High Sierra Camps in the [[Yosemite National Park]]. Long distance backpacking trails with huts also exist in South Africa, including the 100&amp;nbsp;km plus [[Amatola Trail]], in the [[Eastern Cape]] Province.&lt;ref name="footprint.co.za"/&gt; Backpacking (trekking) is also popular in the [[Himalayas]], where [[Porter (carrier)|porters]] and [[pack animals]] are often used. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Illustrated Atlas of the Himalaya|author=Zurick, Pacheco |author2=J.Shrestha |author3=Bajracharya, B. |ISBN=9788183860376 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S20hk99x_-MC|year=2006|publisher=India Research Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equipment ==
[[File:VarsityScoutspreparingtoheadoutbackpacking2004.jpg|left|thumb|Varsity Scouts of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] loading equipment and preparing to backpack]]
{{main|Hiking equipment}}{{Further|Outdoor equipment}}
Backpacking gear begins with (1) a suitable [[backpack]], proper both in size and fit. Backpacks in general fall into one of four categories: frameless, external frame, internal frame, and bodypack. (2) Clothing and footwear appropriate for expected conditions. (3) Adequate food. (4) Some form of sleep system such as a [[sleeping bag]] and, perhaps, a foam pad. (5) [[Survival kit|Survival gear]]. 

A shelter appropriate to expected conditions is typically next. Practical items not already mentioned - cook kit, stove, container for water, a means of purifying it - are characteristically but not always taken in some form. Depending on the trip ready-to-eat foods may suffice and suitable water be found along the way. More [[ultralight backpacking|minimalist backpackers]] find ways to do with less.

Weight is always critical. A rule of thumb suggests a fully loaded backpack should weigh no more than 25% of a person's weight. Every single item is scrutinized, many removed the first time a pack is hefted. Lightweight gear is widely available, which may or may not sacrifice utility and durability but will almost always cost more. A wide variety utilizing carbon fiber, lightweight alloys, specialty plastics, and impregnated fabrics is available.

=== Water ===
[[File:Canteen 0002.jpg|thumb|right|Military [[Canteen (bottle)|canteen]] with nested canteen cup and cover]]
{{see also|wilderness diarrhea|portable water purification|solar water disinfection}}

Proper [[Dehydration|hydration]] is critical to successful backpacking. Depending on conditions - which include weather, terrain, load, and the hiker's age and fitness - a backpacker needs anywhere from 1/2 to 2 gallons (2 to 8 liters), or more, per day. At {{convert|1|kg|lb}} per {{convert|1|L|USqt}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extoxnet.orst.edu/tibs/partperm.htm|title=Comparisons and Conversions|pages=2nd paragraph|accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; water is exceptionally heavy.  It is impossible to carry more than a few days' supply.  Thus provisions for adequate water on a backpacking trip must be made in advance, whether that is knowing of potable sources such as lakes, streams, and springs en route or a means of filtering or purifying tainted water supplies as encountered.

Even in most seemingly pristine areas water needs treatment before consumption to protect against [[waterborne diseases]] carried by [[bacteria]] and [[protozoa]]. The chief treatment methods include:
* Boiling over fire, stove, or other heat source
* Treatment with chemicals such as chlorine or iodine
* Filtering (often used in conjunction with chemical treatments)
* Treatment with [[ultraviolet]] light

Water may be stored in appropriate bottles or collapsible plastic bladders.  [[Hydration pack]]s are increasingly popular.

===Food===

{{See also|Nutrition |Outdoor cooking |Survival skills}}

Backpacking is energy intensive.  It is essential enough food is taken to maintain both energy and health.  As with gear, weight is critical.  Consequently, items with high [[food energy]], long [[shelf life]], and low mass and volume deliver the most utility.  ''Satisfaction'' is another consideration, of greater or lesser importance to all hikers.  Only they can decide whether it's worth the effort (and trade-off against other gear) to carry fresh, heavy, or luxury food items.  The shorter the trip and easier the conditions the more feasible such treats become.

In all cases, both kit and fuel necessary to prepare and serve foodstuffs selected is part of the equation. Small liquid and gas fueled [[portable stove|campstoves]] and ultralight cooking pots are the norm. Increasingly campfires are prohibited.

While most backpackers consume at least some specially prepared foods, many mainly rely on ordinary low moisture household items, such as cold cereal, oatmeal, powdered milk, cheese, crackers, sausage, salami, dried fruit, peanut butter, pasta, rice, and commercially packaged dinner entrees. Popular snacks include [[trail mix]], easily prepared at home; nuts, [[energy bar]]s, chocolate, and other forms of candy for quick energy and satisfaction. [[Jerky (food)|Jerky]] and [[pemmican]] are high-energy and lightweight. Coffee, tea, and cocoa are common beverages.

Domestic items are typically repackaged in zippered plastic bags. Canned or jarred food, except for meats or small delicacies, is avoided: their containers and moist contents are usually heavy, and the metal or glass must be packed out. Food dehydrators are popular for drying fruit, jerky, and pre-cooked meals.

Many hikers use [[freeze-drying|freeze-dried]] precooked entrees for hot meals, quickly reconstituted by adding boiling water. An alternative is [[ultra-high-temperature processing|Ultra High Temperature (UHT) processed]] food, which has its moisture retained and merely needs heating with a special, water-activated [[Flameless ration heater|chemical reaction]].

These have roots in the U.S. military's [[MRE]], and eliminate the need for a stove, fuel, and water.  Against this, they are heavy, the water is already in the food, and they require their own fuel.  Still, they have some attractions.  They:
* Do not need to be rehydrated or heated, useful where flames are prohibited and water is scarce.
* Are very durably packaged
* Contain a full meal complete with snack and dessert in every package
* Offer a great deal of variety in each meal, including condiments
* Individually package their components, allowing some to be stored accessibly and eaten on the move

MREs can be difficult to find in retail stores, though a good selection is often available in a (U.S.) military surplus store.

Specialized cookbooks are available on trailside food and the challenges inherent in making it. Some focus on planning meals and preparing ingredients for short trips. Others on the challenges of organizing and preparing meals revolving around the bulk rationing prevalent in extended trail hikes, particularly those with pre-planned food drops.

=== Winter backpacking===
[[Image:Bivouac2.jpg|thumb|A winter [[bivouac sack|bivouac]] in Germany.]]
Winter backpacking requires a higher level of skill and generally more specialized gear than in other seasons. [[Skis]] or [[snowshoes]] may be required to traverse deep snow, or [[crampons]] and an [[ice axe]] where needed. Winter sleeping bags and tents are essential, as are waterproof, water-repellent, and moisture dissipating materials. Cotton clothing retains moisture and chills the body, both particularly dangerous in cold weather.  Winter backpackers stick to wool or synthetic fabric like nylon or polypropylene, which hold less moisture and often have specialized wicking properties to dissipate sweat generated during aerobic activities. Layering is essential, as wet clothes quickly sap body heat and can lead to [[frostbite]] or [[hypothermia]].

A winter bivouac can also be made in a [[snow cave]]. It has thermal properties similar to an [[igloo]] and is effective both at providing protection from wind and low temperatures.  A properly made snow cave can be 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F) or warmer inside, even when outside temperatures are −40&amp;nbsp;°C (−40&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is constructed by excavating snow so that its entrance tunnel is below the main space in order to retain warm air.  Construction is simplified by building on a steep slope and digging slightly upwards and horizontally into the snow.  The roof is domed to prevent dripping on the occupants.  Adequate snow depth, free of rocks and ice, is needed — generally {{convert|4|to|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} is sufficient. A [[quinzhee]] is similar, but constructed by tunneling into mounded snow rather than by digging into a natural snow formation.

== Skills and safety ==

{{main|Hazards of outdoor recreation}}

* [[Survival skills]] can provide peace of mind and may make the difference between life and death when the weather, terrain, or environment turns unexpectedly for the worse.
* [[Navigation]] and [[orienteering]] are useful to find the [[trailhead]], then find and follow a route to a desired sequence of destinations, and then an exit.  In case of disorientation, orienteering skills are important to determine the current location and formulate a route to somewhere more desirable.  At their most basic, navigation skills allow one to choose the correct sequence of trails to follow. In situations where a trail or clear line-of-sight to the desired destination is not present, navigation and orienteering allow the backpacker to understand the terrain and wilderness around them and, using their tools and practices, select the appropriate direction to hike. Weather (rain, fog, snow), terrain (hilly, rock faces, dense forest), and hiker experience can all impact and increase the challenges to navigation in the wilderness.
* [[First aid]]:  effectively dealing with minor injuries ([[wikt:splinter|splinter]]s, punctures, sprains) is considered by many a fundamental backcountry skill.  More subtle, but maybe even more important, is recognizing and promptly treating [[hypothermia]], [[heat stroke]], [[dehydration]] and [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], as these are rarely encountered in daily life.
* [[Leave No Trace]] is the backpacker's version of the [[Golden Rule (ethics)|golden rule]]:  To have beautiful and pristine places to enjoy, help make them.  At a minimum, don't make them worse.
* [[Distress signal]]ing is a skill of last resort.

'''Birds Eye View''' (BEV) is an organisation established in 2002 to celebrate and support women's work in film, most notably by way of an annual film festival in [[London]] that places women at the heart of the creative vision.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/on-the-agenda-birds-eye-view-film-festival-alan-moore-where-three-dreams-cross-exhibition-christopher-hirsts-love-bites-nicole-richie-the-wapping-project-1909498.html On the agenda: Bird's Eye View Film Festival], ''The Independent'', 28 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview and History==
Birds Eye View was founded by Rachel Millward and [[Pinny Grylls]] in 2002,&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birds-eye-view.co.uk/198/about-us/about-us.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107034240/http://www.birds-eye-view.co.uk/198/about-us/about-us.html |archivedate=2011-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to celebrate and support women filmmakers.

Backed by key figures in the film industry, Birds Eye View describes its work as “a positive response to the fact that women make up only 7% of directors and 12% of writers in the film industry”.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; The organisation’s work includes an annual festival of films by women filmmakers, held in London, as well as a touring programme and year-round training and career development programmes for emerging women filmmakers in the UK. 
In addition to promoting work by women filmmakers, Birds Eye View aims to educate audiences about the importance of diversity in film, and to widen the audiences for women-made films and world cinema.

==Birds Eye View Film Festival, London==
Founded as a short film event in 2002, Birds Eye View registered as a charity in 2004, launched the UK’s first major women’s film festival in 2005, and now operates year-round activity through its BEV Labs, First Weekenders Club, touring programme and online community, in addition to an annual festival in London. Prominent filmmakers and artists to have worked with Birds Eye View include [[Kim Longinotto]], [[Lucy Walker (director)|Lucy Walker]], [[Wanuri Kahiu]], [[Mary Harron]], [[Bella Freud]], [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Susanne Bier]], [[Peace Anyiam-Fiberesima]], [[Tracey Emin]], [[Xiao Jiang]], [[Andrea Arnold]], [[Gillian Wearing]], [[Beeban Kidron]] and [[Marilyn Gaunt]].

For each annual festival, Birds Eye View commissions and produces Sound &amp; Silents, a live-music event whereby leading female musicians perform live, specially-written sets to classic silent films. Musicians to have participated in Sound &amp; Silents include [[Imogen Heap]], [[Natalie Clein]], [[Bishnu Priya|Bishi]], [[Mira Calix]], [[Patti Plinko]], [[Gwyneth Herbert]], The Elysian Quartet, Zoe Rahman, Broken Hearts DJs and JUICE.

The dates for the 7th Birds Eye View Film Festival have been announced as 8 – 17 March 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birds-eye-view.co.uk/3143/overview/birds-eye-view-film-festival-2011.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110031530/http://www.birds-eye-view.co.uk/3143/overview/birds-eye-view-film-festival-2011.html |archivedate=2011-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; held at BFI Southbank ([[British Film Institute]]) and the ICA ([[Institute of Contemporary Arts]]). The programme will include a strand exploring the contribution of women directors and screenwriters to the horror genre, entitled Bloody Women, presented in conjunction with Film 4 FrightFest.

==The Birds Eye View Team==
Birds Eye View’s Director is co-founder Rachel Millward. Millward is currently the Clore Fellow for Film, and was named as one of 50 "Women to Watch" by Arts Council England and the Cultural Leadership Programme, and previously nominated as a ‘World Changing Woman' (The Guardian, 21.08.06). 
Birds Eye View is chaired by producer [[Elizabeth Karlsen]] (''The Crying Game'', ''Little Voice'', ''[[Made in Dagenham]]''), and patrons include [[Mike Figgis]], [[Mira Nair]], [[Joanna Lumley]], [[Juliet Stevenson]], [[Martha Fiennes]], [[Stephen Woolley]] and [[Gurinder Chadha]].

==Birds Eye View in the UK==
Highlights of the Birds Eye View Film Festival programme typically tour the UK throughout the year, playing at regional cinemas such as the Manchester Cornerhouse and Glasgow Film Theatre, as well as music and arts festivals including [[The Big Chill (music festival)|Big Chill]] and [[Latitude]]. The most common touring programmes include screenings of silent films with new live scores by female musicians, which BEV regularly commissions as part of its Sound &amp; Silents programme. The Festival also takes special events to the Edinburgh and [[Cannes]] international film festivals.

==The Birds Eye View Awards==
The Birds Eye View Awards are presented annually to the best feature, documentary and short films screened at the Festival, as selected by juries of leading industry figures and film critics.

==Training==
Birds Eye View's training programmes are called the BEV Labs, made up of specialised intensive training programmes designed to develop new female filmmaker talent and bring new feature films by women into production. 2009's lab 'Last Laugh: Women Create Comedy' saw three comedy feature films from female writers taken onto the Warp X / Warp Films development slates, including work from [[Sally Phillips]], [[Julia Davis]] and [[Lucy Porter]]. These films are currently in development. 
Ongoing Labs include She Writes in partnership with [[The Script Factory]] and Re:Animate in partnership with [[Warp Films]], providing leading female screenwriters and animators with mentoring, industry events and creative support to help advance their projects towards pitching for development slates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birds-eye-view.co.uk/1732/training/training.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111070533/http://www.birds-eye-view.co.uk/1732/training/training.html |archivedate=2011-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 'First Weekenders Club'==
Birds Eye View seeks to promote films made by women through its First Weekenders Club, based on the premise that audiences, and therefore box office, from the opening weekend of a film's theatrical release has a huge impact on its future and on the future of the filmmaker. The First Weekenders Club therefore promotes the first weekend of new releases by women filmmakers. The campaign has received backing from key figures in the film industry including director [[Gurinder Chadha]] and Natasha Walter of the Guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birds-eye-view.co.uk/34/fwc-highlights/first-weekenders-club.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113034730/http://www.birds-eye-view.co.uk/34/fwc-highlights/first-weekenders-club.html |archivedate=2011-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1925">A "'''cerebral rubicon'''" in paleontology is the minimum [[cranial capacity]] required for a specimen to be classified as a certain [[paleospecies]] or genus.  The term is mostly used in reference to human evolution.&lt;ref name=dirt&gt;{{cite web |last=Holmes |first=Andrew |url=http://livelikedirt.blogspot.com/2015/01/homo-files-cerebral-rubicon.html |title=Live Like Dirt: Homo files: the cerebral rubicon |publisher=Livelikedirt.blogspot.com |date=2015-01-02 |accessdate=2016-04-11 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Scottish anthropologist Sir [[Arthur Keith]] set the limit at 750 cc for the genus ''Homo''.&lt;ref
name=dirt/&gt; The minimum cranial capacity for the species [[Homo sapiens]] is generally set at 900cc.&lt;ref
name=dirt/&gt;

One of the reasons for the proposal to exclude ''[[Homo habilis]]'' from the genus ''Homo'', and renaming it as "''Australopithecus habilis''", is the small capacity of their cranium (363cc -600 cc).

==Origin==
The term is most likely a reference to the [[Rubicon]] river, which in the time of the [[Roman Empire]] marked the border between [[Gaul|Cisapline Gaul]] and Italy proper.  Crossing the river with an army, as [[Julius Caesar]] did in 49 B.C., was illegal by Roman law and is commonly seen as the "point-of-no-return" for Caesar's revolution.  As such, a "rubicon" can  be used [[idiom]]atically as any strict dividing line or point-of-no-return.

'''ComicsVerse''' is a comics journalism website covering comics news, reviews, analysis, and interviews with artists and writers. In addition to original written content, the site produces podcasts, videos, original webcomics, and covers news related to politics, gaming, movies, television, and music.&lt;ref name="ComicsVerse About Us"&gt;{{cite web|title=ComicsVerse About Us |url=https://comicsverse.com/comicsverse-aboutus/ |website=ComicsVerse.com |publisher=ComicsVerse.com |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ComicsVerse uses comics to address social issues including minority representation in popular culture and politics. The website is minority owned and operated and has 78% women in upper management positions.

== History ==

Founded in 2012 by Justin Alba, ComicsVerse was incorporated in 2016. Alba and colleague, current Assistant Editor at [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], Kathleen Wisneski, co-organized the ComicsVerse podcast alongside the site following a class at [[Columbia University]] in 2012 entitled “Comic Books and Graphic Novels as Literature.”&lt;ref name="How (X-Men) Comics Saved My Life"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Alba |first1=Justin |title=How (X-Men) Comics Saved My Life |url=https://comicsverse.com/comics-saved-my-life/ |website=ComicsVerse.com |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his Open Letter, Alba writes that  “comics saved my life” by teaching him how to cope with severe bullying and develop self-confidence. Alba notes that ComicsVerse’s goal is to “help people like me who went through challenging and turbulent times” by engaging in a community of comics fans and creators.&lt;ref name = "How (X-Men) Comics Saved My Life"/&gt;

ComicsVerse immediately treated comics as an art form, rejecting the tendency in academia to dismiss comics as anti-literary.&lt;ref name="Comics as Literature?"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chute |first1=Hillary |title=Comics as Literature? Reading Graphic Narrative |journal=PMLA |date=2008 |volume=123 |issue=2 |page=452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, ComicsVerse has expanded its discussion of mainstream comics like Marvel and DC to include comics from smaller and independent publishers, as well as comics-related television and film, and politics and culture outside of comics.&lt;ref name ="ComicsVerse About Us"/&gt;

ComicsVerse also features a Special Edition series on [[New York Comic Convention]],&lt;ref name = "ComicsVerse New York Comic Con"&gt;{{cite web |title=ComicsVerse New York Comic Con |url=https://comicsverse.com/new-york-comic-con/ |website=Comicsverse.com |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on creator interviews and character analysis in Marvel, DC, Image and indie comics.&lt;ref name = "How (X-Men) Comics Saved My Life"/&gt;

== Purpose ==
ComicsVerse defines its mission to use “comics as a platform to discuss social issues of our time like race, sexuality, gender and inequality” &lt;ref name ="ComicsVerse About Us"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "One of the Best Political Podcasts"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Herman |first1=Lily |title=One of the Best Political Podcasts in the Game Is Centered Around Comic Books |url=https://medium.com/the-queue/one-of-the-best-political-podcasts-in-the-game-is-centered-around-comic-books-a857f3153c25 |website=Medium.com|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ComicsVerse investigates diversity in comic books and pop culture in order discuss representation, social justice, and build a community.&lt;ref name="Diversity in Comics"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dern |first1=Zachary |title=Diversity In Comics: What’s Been Done And What Needs to Come |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/diversity-in-comics-whats-been-done-and-what-needs_us_5933b75fe4b0649fff211a07 |website=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Podcast ==

The ComicsVerse podcast has an international audience.&lt;ref name = "How (X-Men) Comics Saved My Life"/&gt; The podcast has earned attention for its in-depth discussion of politics, human rights, and social justice as well as character analyses, creator interviews, and coverage of comics-related events like the New York Comic Con.&lt;ref name ="ComicsVerse About Us"/&gt;

The podcast balances discussion of mainstream superhero comics with niche graphic narratives, using different genres and media to investigate political topics.&lt;ref name = "One of the Best Political Podcasts"/&gt;

In 2017 the webcomic was nominated for a People's Choice Podcast Award in entertainment.&lt;ref name="Podcast Award 2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=Podcast Award The People's Choice |url=https://www.podcastawards.com/ |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparative education''' Comparative education is a discipline in the social sciences which entails the scrutiny and evaluation of different educational systems, such as those in various countries. Professionals in this area of endeavor are absorbed in advancing evocative terminologies and guidelines for education worldwide, enhancing educational structures and producing a context to which the success and effectivity of education programs and initiatives can be assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bray|first=M|date=1995|title=Levels of Comparison in Education Studies.|url=|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=65|pages=472-490|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives and Scope ==
According to [[Harold J. Noah|Harold Noah]] (1985),{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} and Farooq Joubish (2009),{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} comparative education has four purposes:
#To describe educational systems, processes, or outcomes.
#To assist in the development of educational institutions and practices.
#To highlight the relationships between education and society.
#To establish generalized statements about education that are valid in more than one country.
#To help the current generation, understand the nowardays education systems, with reference to the past.
Comparative education is often incorrectly assumed to exclusively encompass studies that compare two or more different countries. In fact, since its early days researchers in this field have often eschewed such approaches, preferring rather to focus on comparisons within a single country over time. Still, some large scale projects, such as the [[PISA]] and [[TIMSS]] studies, have made important findings through explicitly comparative macroanalysis of massive data sets. Recent examples in this regard include studies analyzing intra-European &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=2018-03-29|title=Elementary Teacher Education in the Top Performing European TIMSS Countries: A Comparative Study|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ies/article/view/74480|journal=International Education Studies|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=152|doi=10.5539/ies.v11n4p152|issn=1913-9039}}&lt;/ref&gt; and intra-American&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=2018-04-09|title=Comparing the Costs and Benefits of Attending the Top Three U.S. Elementary Teacher Education Programs|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/hes/article/view/74711|journal=Higher Education Studies|language=en-US|volume=8|issue=2|pages=70|doi=10.5539/hes.v8n2p70|issn=1925-475X}}&lt;/ref&gt; teacher education.

== Rationale for the Field ==
Many important educational questions can best be examined from an international and comparative perspective. For example, in the [[United States]] there is no nationwide certificate of completion of [[secondary education]]. This raises the question of what the advantages and disadvantages are of leaving such certification to each of the 50 states.{{By whom|date=June 2018}} Comparative education draws on the experience of countries such as [[Japan]] and [[France]] to show how a centralized system works, and what the advantages and disadvantages of a centralized certification are.

Critics of comparative education refer to it as Policy Borrowing.{{Definition needed|date=June 2018}}

== Disciplinary Identity ==
Comparative education is closely allied to, and may overlap with, [[international education]], [[international development education]], and [[comparative sociology]].

== Comparative and International Education Society ==
The [[Comparative and International Education Society]] (CIES) was founded in 1956 to foster "cross-cultural understanding, scholarship, academic achievement, and societal development through the international study of educational ideas, systems, and practices."

[[File:Gulf Worldwide Sales &amp; Marketing Team.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Office workers in cubicles]]
[[File:CubeSpace.jpg|thumb|250px|Empty cubicles in an office]]

A '''cubicle''' is a partially enclosed office workspace that is separated from neighboring workspaces by partitions that are usually {{convert|5|-|6|ft}} tall. Its purpose is to isolate office workers and managers from the sights and noises of an [[Open plan|open workspace]] so that they may concentrate with fewer distractions. Cubicles are composed of modular elements such as walls, work surfaces, overhead bins, drawers, and shelving, which can be configured depending on the user's needs. Installation is generally performed by trained personnel, although some cubicles allow configuration changes to be performed by users without specific training.

Cubicles in the 2010s are usually equipped with a computer, monitor, keyboard and mouse on the work surface. Cubicles typically have a desk phone. Since many offices use overhead [[fluorescent light]]s to illuminate the office, cubicles may or may not have lamps or other additional lighting. Other furniture that is often used in cubicles includes an office chair, a filing cabinet for locking documents away, a bookcase and a coatrack.

The office cubicle was created by designer [[Robert Propst (inventor)|Robert Propst]] for [[Herman Miller (manufacturer)|Herman Miller]], and released in 1967 under the name "[[Action Office]] II". Although cubicles are often seen as being symbolic of work in a modern office setting due to their uniformity and blandness, they afford the employee a greater degree of privacy and personalization than in previous work environments, which often consisted of desks lined up in rows within an open room.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt; They do so at a lower cost than individual, private offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Diaz |first1=Jesus |title=The real reason your company switched to an open plan office |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90220029/the-real-reason-your-company-switched-to-an-open-plan-office |accessdate=17 August 2018 |work=[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]] |date=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some office cubicle workspaces, employees can decorate the walls of their cubicle with posters, pictures and other items.

==Terminology==
A cubicle is also called a '''cubicle desk''', '''office cubicle,''' '''cubicle workstation''', or simply a '''cube'''.  An [[office]] filled with cubicles is sometimes called a '''sea of cubicles'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/85/zones.html|title=Time (Zone) Travelers|last=Kirsner|first=Scott|date=1 August 2004|newspaper=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''cube farm'''. Although humorous, the phrase usually has negative connotations. 

==History==
[[File:Photograph of the Division of Classification and Cataloging, 1937.tif|thumb|right|Before cubicles: open office with desks arranged in rows, 1937]]

The term cubicle comes from the [[Latin]] ''cubiculum'', for bed chamber. It was used in English as early as the 15th century. It eventually came to be used for small chambers of all sorts, and for small rooms or study spaces with partitions which do not reach to the ceiling. Like the older [[carrel desk]], a cubicle seeks to give a degree of privacy to the user while taking up minimal space in a large or medium-sized room. Prior to the widespread adoption of cubicles, office workers often worked at desks arranged in rows in an open room, where they were exposed to the sounds and activity of those working around them.

===Action Office I===
{{main|Action Office}}
In 1960, [[Herman Miller (manufacturer)|Herman Miller]] created the Herman Miller Research Corporation under the direction of [[Robert Propst (inventor)|Robert Propst]], and the supervision of [[George Nelson (designer)|George Nelson]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Habegger |first=Jerryll |title=Sourcebook of Modern Furniture (Third Edition) |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company |year=2005 |location=New York, New York |isbn=0-393-73170-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pina |first=Leslie |title=Classic Herman Miller |publisher=Schiffer Publishing |year=1998 |location=Atglen, Pennsylvania |isbn=0-7643-0471-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission was to solve problems related to the use of furniture, but not the furniture itself.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt; The corporation's first major project was an evaluation of the "office" as it had evolved during the 20th Century, and in particular, how it functioned in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt; Propst's studies included learning about the ways people work in an office, how information travels, and how the office layout affects their performance. Propst consulted with [[mathematicians]], [[Behavioral psychology|behavioral psychologists]], and [[anthropologists]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;

Propst concluded from his studies that during the 20th Century the office environment had changed substantially, particularly in relation to the amount of information being processed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt; The amount of information an employee had to analyze, organize, and maintain had increased dramatically. Despite this, the basic layout of the corporate office had remained largely unchanged, with employees sitting behind rows of traditional desks in a large open room, devoid of privacy. Propst's studies suggested that an open environment actually reduced communication between employees, and impeded personal initiative.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt; On this, Propst commented "One of the regrettable conditions of present day offices is the tendency to provide a formula kind of sameness for everyone."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt; In addition, the employees' bodies were suffering from long hours of sitting in one position. Propst concluded that office workers require both privacy and interaction, depending on which of their many duties they were performing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;

Propst and the Research Corporation developed a plan, which [[George Nelson (designer)|George Nelson]]'s office executed in the form of the [[Action Office]] I (AO-1), and introduced it in the Herman Miller lineup in 1964.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt; AO-1 featured desks and workspaces of varying height which allowed the worker a freedom of movement, and to assume the work position best suited for the task.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt; AO-1 was ideally suited to small professional offices in which managers and employees often interacted using the same furnishings, but wasn't suitable for large corporation offices. In addition, it was expensive and difficult to assemble.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt; Despite its shortcomings, Nelson won the [[Alcoa Award]] for the design, neglecting to mention Propst's contribution.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;

===Action Office II===
Following the poor sales of the AO-1, Propst and Nelson went back to the drawing board.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt; For several years, Propst and Nelson fought over a disagreement on the work environment best suited to the employee of a corporate office, and Nelson was eventually taken off the project.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;  Nelson's departure left Propst free to indulge in his concept of an office capable of constant change to suit the changing needs of the employee, without having to purchase new furnishings, and allowing the employee a degree of privacy, and the ability to personalize the work environment without impacting the environment of the workers nearby.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt; Propst recognized that people are more productive within a territorial enclave that they can personalize, but also that they require vistas outside their space.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt; Propst's concept was the "back-up", a two- or three-sided vertical division that defined territory and afforded privacy without hindering the ability to view or participate in surrounding activities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;

Propst based AO-2 around the mobile wall-unit that defined space.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt; The unit also supported multiple workstation furnishings, which benefited from the vertically oriented work-space.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt; The components were interchangeable, standardized, and simple to assemble and install. More importantly, they were highly flexible, allowing employers to modify the work environment as needs changed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;The AO-2 lineup met with unprecedented success, and other manufacturers quickly copied it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt; In 1978, ''"Action Office II"'' was renamed simply ''"Action Office"'', and by 2005 had attained sales totaling $5 billion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;

==First appearances==
The first offices to incorporate the ''"Action Office"'' design were in the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]], which contracted with George Nelson and Herman Miller in 1963 to design an innovative office space that could maximize efficiency in a small area. The result was based on Nelson's CPS (Comprehensive Panel System), and featured "pods" of four cubicles arranged in a [[swastika]] pattern, each with an "L" shaped desk and overhead storage. Surviving photos of the Federal Reserve Bank offices reveal a design that would not appear much different from a cubicle of today.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Abercrombie |first=Stanley |title=George Nelson: The Design of Modern Design |publisher=The MIT Press |year=1995 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=0-262-01142-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 this design was re-used for the [[Woman's Medical Clinic]] of [[Lafayette, Indiana]]. Nelson also used the design in his own New York design offices.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"/&gt;

Between 2000 and 2002, [[IBM]] partnered with the office furniture manufacturer [[Steelcase]], and researched the software, hardware, and ergonomic aspects of the cubicle of the future (or the [[office of the future]]) under the name "Bluespace". They produced several prototypes of this hi-tech multi screened work space and even exhibited one at [[Walt Disney World]]. Bluespace offered movable multiple screens inside and outside, a projection system, advanced individual lighting, heating and ventilation controls, and a host of software applications to orchestrate everything.

In 1994 designer Douglas Ball planned and built several iterations of the [[Clipper CS-1|Clipper]] or [[Clipper CS-1|CS-1]], a "capsule" desk looking like the streamlined front fuselage of a fighter plane. Meant as a computer workstation, it had louvers and an integrated ventilation system, as well as a host of built-in features typical of the [[ergonomic desk]]. An office space filled with these instead of traditional squarish cubicles would look like a hangar filled with small flight simulators. It was selected for the permanent design collection of the Design Museum in the United Kingdom.

== Uses ==
Cube farms are often found in high-tech companies, but they are also widely used in the insurance industry and other service-related fields and in government offices. Many cube farms were built during the [[Dot-com bubble|dotcom boom]].

== Effect on productivity ==
One alternative is an open workspace, which puts employees at desks or tables in the same large room, but without cubicle walls to absorb sound or provide a visual separation.  People working in cubicles are more productive than employees in an open workspace.  They also have more face-to-face interactions, and send fewer e-mail messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernstein|first=Ethan S.|last2=Turban|first2=Stephen|date=2018-08-19|title=The impact of the ‘open’ workspace on human collaboration|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/373/1753/20170239|journal=Phil.

==Impact on society==
[[Image:Sea-of-cubicles-2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A floor plan showing repetitive, regimented cubicles]]
It is unlikely that any other office furnishings has had as much of a social impact as the introduction of the office cubicle in the 1960s, though the outcome of the cubicle's arrival is still open to debate, in both its pros and cons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Open VS Closed Space Work Environments |url=https://www.theperspective.com/debates/living/open-vs-closed-space-work-environments/ |publisher=The Perspective |date=27 October 2017 |accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Thomas Hine has gone so far as to speculate that the cubicle made it possible for women to move into middle management positions in the late 1960s because the introduction of cubicles gave their male counterparts a new office environment in which to place women managers without having to allow their entry into the private "bull pens" that had been the exclusive domain of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hine |first=Thomas |title=The Great Funk |publisher=Sara Crichton Books |year=2007 |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0-374-14839-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite becoming Herman Miller's most successful project, George Nelson disowned himself from any connection with the ''"Action Office II"'' line.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"/&gt; In 1970 he sent a letter to Robert Blaich, who had become Herman Miller's Vice-President for Corporate Design and Communication, in which he described the system's "dehumanizing effect as a working environment." He summed up his feeling by saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One does not have to be an especially perceptive critic to realize that AO II is definitely not a system which produces an environment gratifying for people in general. But it is admirable for planners looking for ways of cramming in a maximum number of bodies, for "employees" (as against individuals), for "personnel," corporate zombies, the walking dead, the silent majority. A large market.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scornful as he may have been, Nelson was right that there turned out to be a "larger market" for AO II. By 2005 total sales had reached $5 billion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"/&gt;

Cultural commentary about cubicles was done in the 1990s and early 2000s. One of the most sarcastic critics of the cubicle has been [[Scott Adams]], speaking through his comic strip, ''[[Dilbert]]'', which depicts an IT company employee who works in a cubicle. In 2001 he teamed up with the design company [[IDEO]] to create "Dilbert's Ultimate Cubicle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ideo.com/work/item/dilberts-ultimate-cubicle/|title=Dilbert's Ultimate Cubicle|date=|publisher=IDEO|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017152226/http://www.ideo.com/work/item/dilberts-ultimate-cubicle|archivedate=2010-10-17|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2011-03-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included both whimsical aspects, a modular approach and attention to usually-neglected ergonomic details like the change in light orientation as the day advances. Similarly, [[Douglas Coupland]] has coined the phrase "[[veal]]-fattening pen", a deprecation of cubicles in his novel ''[[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture]]''. Cubicles are depicted in modern films such as the sci-fi movie ''[[The Matrix (film)|The Matrix]]'', in which a programmer who is moonlighting as a [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] spends his days in a drab cubicle and the comedy ''[[Office Space]]'', which depicted a [[boreout|bored]] group of IT workers who worked in cubicles.

'''CyberArts International''' was a series of conferences dealing with emerging technologies that took place during years 1990, 1991, and 1992 in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Pasadena, California]]. The gatherings brought together artists and developers in all types of [[new media]], including software engineers, [[electronic music|electronic musicians]], and graphic artists to explore what was a new field at the time, digital media collaborations. 

A fourth, reunion, exposition was held in [[San Francisco]] in September 2001 but saw its attendance undercut by the transportation difficulties which followed the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]].

The conferences dealt with the interrelationship between computer technology, visual design, music and sound, education, and entertainment.

==History==
[[File:BoothsAtCyberArtsInt.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The CyberArts International expositions were each an amalgam of educational conference, music festival, art exhibition, and trade show.]]

=== Background ===

CyberArts International was a series of three annual conferences and exhibitions held in [[Southern California]] from 1990 to 1992, focusing upon emerging technologies and techniques for artists working to build interactivity or in the multimedia field.&lt;ref name=Jacobson-viii&gt;Linda Jacobson (ed.), ''CyberArts: Exploring Art and Technology.'' San Francisco, CA: Miller Freeman, Inc., 1992; pg. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; The expositions were originally developed by Dominic Milano, editor of ''[[Keyboard Magazine]],'' who served as conference chair, in collaboration with Robert B. Gelman, event producer and Director of Business Development for [[Miller Freeman, Inc.|Miller Freeman Expositions]].&lt;ref name=Jacobson-viii /&gt; 

Other paid staff members and volunteers also assisted in event preparation, including arts organizations YLEM&lt;ref name=YLEM&gt;[http://www.ylem.org/Membership/history_detailed.html "A Detailed History of YLEM,"] www.ylem.org, accessed January 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and EZTV,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eztvmedia.com/CyberSpace%20Gallery/cyberhis.html "A Brief History of CyberSpace Gallery,"] www.eztvmedia.com, accessed January 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as author and publisher Michael Gosney of ''Verbum Magazine,'' who later co-produced a series of [[Digital Be-In]]s with Robert Gelman from 1993 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;"10th Anniversary Digital Be-In Set to Launch with New Location, All-Night Techno Dance, Netcast," www.be-in.com Verbum, Inc., accessed January 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The notion of cyberarts===

The term [[cyberarts]] is a [[portmanteau]] combining the root word of [[cybernetics]], dealing with the study of control systems in machines and human nervous systems, and the word for the broad creative fields dealing with the creation of objects of form, beauty, and expression.&lt;ref name=Jacobson5&gt;Jacobson, "Preface" to ''CyberArts: Exploring Art and Technology,'' pg. v.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspiration for the CyberArts International conferences revolved around the artistic implications of the rapidly changing technologies related to computers, input devices, digital storage, networking, and reproduction — parallel technologies that were revolutionizing the traditional visual and sonic arts and making possible new forms of artistic expression.&lt;ref name=Jacobson5 /&gt;

As one enthusiast noted, these new and changing computer tools served to "enhance the creative process by making it easy to experiment with color schemes, sound layers, scene transitions, 3D models, photo retouching, and animated characters."&lt;ref&gt;jacobson, "Preface," pp. v-vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convention structure===
[[File:Machover.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Composer and technical innovator [[Tod Machover]] demonstrated the sound-altering Hyper-Glove while conducting musicians at the 1990 CyberArts International festival.]]

The motivating concept behind the CyberArts International conventions was a desire to bring together artists working in the various [[new media]] and the firms producing tools for such work, blending artistic exhibition with trade show. During the day the gatherings featured interactive exhibitions and aisles of traditional exhibit booths found at any ordinary [[trade fair|trade show]]. There were in addition numerous interactive art installations, including some that could be ridden like [[amusement park]] rides and others which were for their time cutting edge demonstrations of [[interactive games]]. Iconic technologies of the future such as [[CD-ROM]]s and [[virtual reality]] were demonstrated to participants at these tech expositions.&lt;ref&gt;Atau Tanaka, "CyberArts International, ''Computer Music Journal,'' vol. 15, no. 1 (1991), pg. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The electronic publisher [[Jaime Levy]] exhibited and sold her floppy disk magazine "Cyber Rag" that was created in [[HyperCard]]. 

The CyberArts International festivals also featured lectures and workshops dealing with the process of creation of new media art forms, allowing discussion about the rationale and implications of such work. There was also spontaneous collaborative art and performance in real-time.&lt;ref name=Haithman&gt;Diane Haithman, [http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-08/entertainment/ca-605_1_virtual-reality "Festival '90: Reality's Different at CyberArts Convention: Electronics: Interactive Technology Lets People Control an Environment with a Computer, Even Simulating the Sensation of Flight,"] ''Los Angeles Times,'' issue=892-8580, September 8, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evening concerts were also held in conjunction with the CyberArts International festivals, featuring performances by musicians interested in new technologies such as [[Jaron Lanier]], [[Stanley Jordan]], [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Tod Machover]], and [[D'Cuckoo]].

===Events===
[[File:Nelson-Keynote.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Each convention heard keynote speakers who expounded on the relationship of technology to the arts.]]

Three annual conferences were held from 1990 to 1992. These were covered by local and national media, including the ''[[Los Angeles Times]], [[Macworld]], [[PC World]], and [[Amusement Today]],'' which reported on various aspects of the eclectic events. Media accounts likened the concerts associated with the conferences to a "Techno-Woodstock" or a "visionary party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gelman|first1=Robert B.|title=What's Up Here?|url=http://www.cyberarts.org/intro.htm|website=CyberArts International|accessdate=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CyberArts International X, a 10-year reunion commemorating the original CyberArts International events was hosted at [[Exploratorium|The Exploratorium]] in San Francisco on September 15 and 16, 2001. All of the original participants were invited to return and update one another on the developments of the decade past, and a few new art/technology innovations were to be unveiled.&lt;ref name=YLEM /&gt; The [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] intervened, dramatically impacting the American air transportation system and preventing the participation of some scheduled conference participants.&lt;ref name=YLEM /&gt; 

Many key figures, including [[Fiorella Terenzi]] of Italy, were limited to participation via web-conference, marred by the relatively low bandwidth of the day.{{cn|date=August 2015}}  A [[Haiku]] Wall was created to allow attendees to express themselves, and performances featured a number of emerging artists of that time.{{cn|date=August 2015}}

'''Damiani S.p.A''' or ''Damiani Group'', is an Italian luxury [[jewelry]] [[corporate group]] that designs, manufactures, distributes and sells jewelry and luxury [[watches]].&lt;ref name="Damiani S.p.A. eveluation"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://business.highbeam.com/company-profiles/info/774950/damiani-s-p-a | title=Damiani S.p.A. eveluation | publisher=HighBeam | accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in Italy in 1924. The company uses celebrity endorsements to market its products. In the early 2000s the company had a dispute with [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]] regarding the use of their names and wedding ring designs. The dispute was settled for $50 million and the couple helped Damiani create and market a line of products.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Damiani expanded across Asia and the US. It went public in 2007. Its most well-known jewelry product brands are Salvini, Alfieri &amp; St. John and Bliss.

==History==
Damiani was founded in 1924 by Enrico Grassi Damiani, in [[Valenza]], [[Italy]]. It became popular among affluent Italians.&lt;ref name="Damiani on sparkling form with new travel retail concept"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://moodiereport.com/document.php?doc_id=24288 | title=Damiani on sparkling form with new travel retail concept | publisher=The Moodie Report | date=28 October 2010 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=Pittilla,  Mary Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damiani's son led the company from 1960-1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Studi Societari|url=http://www.borsaitaliana.it/documenti/studi.htm?filename=96429.pdf|publisher=Borsa Italian SpA|accessdate=12 February 2014|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It started selling products on the US market in 2001 and introduced a $2.5 million ad campaign the following year.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Molofsky R.

Accessed May 31, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Damiani experienced negative press&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; after [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]] filed a lawsuit. They said Damiani was selling reproductions of the ring custom-designed by Brad Pitt and made exclusively for their wedding in violation of their agreement with Damiani.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; Damiani said they never made that agreement and that the rings were merely chosen from a collection of wedding rings.&lt;ref name="Damiani says it owns the designs to Pitt and Aniston's wedding bands"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jckonline.com/2001/08/09/damiani-says-it-owns-designs-to-pitt-and-anistons-wedding-bands | title=Damiani says it owns the designs to Pitt and Aniston's wedding bands | publisher=JCK Magazine | date=August 9, 2001 | accessdate=6 February 2014 | author=DeMarco, Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt; A settlement was reached for $50 million in January 2002.

The '''''Donne Triptych''''' (or '''''Donne Altarpiece''''') is a hinged-[[triptych]] altarpiece by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Hans Memling]]. It consists of five individual panel paintings: a central inner panel, and two double-sided wings. It was painted for [[Sir John Donne]], probably sometime between the late 1470s or early 1480s, and is in the permanent collection of the [[National Gallery]], London, with the panels still in their original frames.

When Donne commissioned the work is unknown. Art historians have debated whether it was painted in the early 1480s, around the same time Memling painted ''[[Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine (Memling)|Virgin and Child with Saints Catherine of Alexandria and Barbara]]'', in New York at the [[Metropolitan Art Museum]]. An earlier date of sometime in the late 1470s is possible, at the time he completed the similar ''[[St John Altarpiece (Memling)|St John Altarpiece]]'', or it may have been painted as a precursor to that altarpiece.&lt;ref name = "Met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/437054 "Virgin and Child with Saints"].

National Gallery. Retrieved May 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blum, 92&lt;/ref&gt; 

The donor, Sir John Donne, was a Welsh-born diplomat for the [[House of York]] who visited Bruges at least once, in 1468 to attend [[Charles the Bold]] and [[Margaret of York]]'s wedding; how he became acquainted with Memling is as uncertain as when he commissioned the triptych.&lt;ref name ="Bruce79"&gt;Bruce, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''egg dance''' is a traditional [[Easter]] [[game]] in which [[Egg (food)|eggs]] are laid on the ground or floor and the goal is to dance among them damaging as few as possible.&lt;ref name=newall&gt;{{cite book |first=Venetia |last=Newall |date=1971 |title=An Egg at Easter: A Folklore Study |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6M9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=%22egg+tapping+is%22&amp;sig=IIONMC3CdMM6Ze5XBsnYJ4uQqHM |publisher=Routledge &amp; Paul |isbn=071006845X |page=344 |accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The egg was a symbol of the rebirth of the earth in [[Paganism|Pagan]] celebrations of spring and was adopted by early [[Christians]] as a symbol of the rebirth of man at Easter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warwickshire.gov.uk/web/corporate/pages.nsf/Links/EA816EE5D35EB8258025714700320280/$file/History+of+the+Easter+Egg.pdf |archivedate=29 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629024306/http://www.warwickshire.gov.uk/web/corporate/pages.nsf/Links/EA816EE5D35EB8258025714700320280/$file/History+of+the+Easter+Egg.pdf |publisher=Warwickshire County Council |title=The history of the Easter egg |accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of egg dancing was a springtime game depicted in the painting of [[Pieter Aertsen]]. The goal was to roll an egg out of a bowl while keeping within a circle drawn by chalk and then flip the bowl to cover the egg. This had to be done with the feet without touching the other objects placed on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ftp.metalab.unc.edu/wm/paint/auth/aertsen/egg-dance/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070617010713/http://ftp.metalab.unc.edu/wm/paint/auth/aertsen/egg-dance/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-06-17 |title=Aertsen's ''The Egg Dance''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-A-3 |title=The Egg Dance, Pieter Aertsen, 1552 |publisher=Rijksmuseum |location=Amsterdam |date= |accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
An early reference to an egg dance was at the wedding of [[Archduchess Margaret of Austria|Margaret of Austria]] and [[Philibert II, Duke of Savoy|Philibert of Savoy]] on [[Easter Monday]] of 1498.&lt;ref name=newall/&gt; The event was described in an 1895 issue of ''[[The American Magazine]]'' as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The American Magazine |volume=39 |date=1895 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JPMJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA390&amp;dq=%22egg+dance%22 |title=Easter Eggs |first=M. E. Leicester |last=Addis |publisher=Crowell-Collier Publishing Company |page=390 |accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then the great egg dance, the special dance of the season, began. A hundred eggs were scattered over a level space covered with sand, and a young couple, taking hands, began the dance. If they finished without breaking an egg they were betrothed, and not even an obdurate parent could oppose the marriage.

After three couples had failed, midst the laughter and shouts of derision of the on-lookers, Philibert of Savoy, bending on his knee before Marguerite, begged her consent to try the dance with him. The admiring crowd of retainers shouted in approval, "Savoy and Austria!" When the dance was ended and no eggs were broken the enthusiasm was unbounded.

Philibert said, "Let us adopt the custom of Bresse." And they were affianced, and shortly afterward married.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the United Kingdom the dancing takes the form of hopping and sometimes called the '''hop-egg'''. There were various forms of egg-dance, but Mark Knowles writes that it was brought to England from Germany by the Saxons as early as the 5th century.&lt;ref name=knowles/&gt;  The Saxon word ''hoppe'' means "to dance".&lt;ref name=tyrwhitt&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Tyrwhitt |authorlink=Thomas Tyrwhitt |title=The Canterbury Tales of Chaucer: With an Essay Upon His Language" |date=1882 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGIgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=hoppesters&amp;source=web&amp;ots=YDkVI5X-Yt&amp;sig=VN4lMQMy6EixcBLm22BN1O5CbgI&amp;hl=en |volume=IV |location=London |publisher=W. Pickering |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1867 book ''The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England'' reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Joseph |last1=Strutt |first2=William |last2=Hone |date=1867 |title=The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England From the Earliest Period; Including the Rural and Domestic Recreations, May Games, Mummeries, Pageants, Processions and Pompous Spectacles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=txELAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA225  |page=225 |location=London |publisher=William Tegg}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The indication  of such a performance occurs in an old comedy, entitled ''The longer thou livest, the more Foole thou art'', by [[William Wager]] in the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], where we meet with these lines:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Upon my one foote pretely I can hoppe.&lt;br/&gt;And daunce it trimley about an egge.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Dancing upon one foot was exhibited by the Saxon [[gleemen]], and probably by the Norman [[minstrel]]s, but more especially by the women-dancers, who might thence acquire the name of ''hoppesteres'',&lt;ref&gt;In fact there has been a  scholastic discussion among Chaucer commenters about the word ''hoppesteres'' used in the expression "shippes hoppesteres"; see T. Tyrwhitt's reference.&lt;/ref&gt; which is given by [[Chaucer]]. A vestige of this denomination is still retained, and applied to dancing, though somewhat contemptuously; for an inferior dancing-meeting is generally called a hop. 

Hopping matches for prizes were occasionally made in the sixteenth century, as we learn from [[John Heywoode]] the [[epigram]]matist. In his ''Proverbs'' printed in 1566, are the following lines:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Where wooers hoppe in and out, long time may bring&lt;br/&gt;Him that hoppeth best at last to have the ring&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But to return to the egg-dance. This performance was common enough about thirty years back and was well received at [[Sadler's Wells]]; where I saw it exhibited, not by simply hopping round a single egg, but in a manner that much increased the difficulty. A number of eggs, I do not precisely recollect how many, but I believe about twelve or fourteen, were placed at certain distances marked upon the stage; the dancer, taking his stand, was blind-folded, and a hornpipe being played in the orchestra, he went through all the paces and figures of the dance, passing backwards and forwards between the eggs  without touching them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[hornpipe]] was one of dances performed as an egg dance. Sometimes it was danced blindfolded. For example, the famous American hornpipe dancer [[John Durang]] performed one of his hornpipes blindfolded on a scene covered with eggs.&lt;ref name=knowles&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Knowles |year=2002 |title=Tap Roots: The Early History of Tap Dancing |isbn=0-7864-1267-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g7vtBsF5OH0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA18&amp;dq=%22egg+dance%22&amp;sig=NgIYd_fRwwtiVjoRb1atGa3ygCs#PRA1-PA18,M1 |page=18 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Co |accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julian Mates]] in his book ''The American Stage before 1800'' notes that blindfolded egg dances were popular musical act both in Europe and the United States during the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mindy |last=Aloff |date=2004 |title=Dance Anecdotes: Stories from the Worlds of Ballet, Broadway, the Ballroom, and Modern Dance |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-505411-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfEhC1N3AhcC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=%22egg+dance%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=DajhR9PbPIvUsgPN0eTaBA&amp;sig=ysms_ovsc_f0HX_DXOko0M6MPw8#PPA132,M1 |page=132 |accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''flag of Saint Barthélemy''' is the [[Flag of France|French tricolor]]. This is because Saint Barthélemy is a self-governing [[overseas collectivity]] of [[France]]. An unofficial '''flag of [[Saint Barthélemy]]''' consisting of the island's [[coat of arms of Saint-Barthélemy|coat of arms]] centered on a white field is also used on the island.

[[File:Blason St Barthélémy TOM entire.svg|thumb|250px|right|Coat of arms of Saint Barthélemy.]]

The '''coat of arms of Saint-Barthélemy''' is a shield divided into three horizontal stripes (parted per fess), three gold [[fleur-de-lis|fleurs-de-lis]] on blue, above a white [[Maltese cross]] on red, over [[Three Crowns|three gold crowns]] on blue, and "Ouanalao" is what the indigenous people called the island. On top of the shield is a [[mural crown]].

The fleurs-de-lis, Maltese Cross, and gold crowns are [[heraldry|heraldic]] reminders of the island's history as a colony ruled by first the [[Kingdom of France]], then the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and in turn the [[Kingdom of Sweden]]. Eventually, the island returned to French rule.

On a white background, the arms serves as the unofficial flag of Saint Barthélemy.

'''''Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl''''' is a 2015 memoir by [[Carrie Brownstein]], a bisexual guitarist and singer.&lt;ref name="Compton2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rowe2015/&gt; Named for one of her lyrics, is about her life in and around music. Starting with her as a young hyper-performative young nerd, who runs for vice president of her Washington State elementary school. The story goes on to cover Brownstein's escape from a turbulent family life into a world where music was the means toward self-invention, community, and rescue. Along the way, Brownstein chronicles the excitement and contradictions within the era’s flourishing and fiercely independent music subculture, including experiences that sowed the seeds for the observational satire of the popular television series ''Portlandia,'' years later.

==Publication history==
Brownstein published the 256-page memoir with [[Riverhead Books|Riverhead]], an imprint of [[Penguin Group]], on October 27, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/9781594486630|title=Nonfiction Book Review: Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl: A Memoir by Carrie Brownstein.

==Reception==
The book received largely positive reviews. In ''[[The Guardian]]'', Michelle Dean compared Brownstein's writing to her band [[Sleater-Kinney]]'s "intensity", saying "Brownstein’s book has a similarly fierce approach," and felt that even if "there are certainly places where an editor could and should have chiseled her prose down to make her points sharper and more affecting, this book is the clear product of a very intelligent person, and filled with flashes of insight and wit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/nov/07/hunger-makes-me-a-modern-girl-by-carrie-brownstein-review|title=Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl: Carrie Brownstein's darkly compelling read|last=Dean|first=Michelle|date=2015-11-07|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in ''[[The New York Times]]'', John Williams contrasted the tone of ''Hunger'' with Brownstein's work in Sleater-Kinney, saying "readers who have...thrilled to Ms. Brownstein’s supremely confident antics onstage...may be disappointed by this memoir’s nearly incessant tone of self-deprecation...But Ms. Brownstein is interested in telling us who she is — and how she sees herself — without a guitar in her hands. 'I was relieved that music had done exactly what I had always wanted it to do,' she writes in this both candid and evasive book, 'which was turn me into someone else.'"&lt;ref name=Williams2015 /&gt;

==Television adaptation==
Brownstein is adapting her memoir into a half-hour television [[Pilot (television episode)|pilot]], entitled ''Search and Destroy'', for streaming service [[Hulu]]. She is set to write, direct, and executive produce alongside [[Megan Ellison]], [[Sue Naegle]], and Ali Krug. The pilot is being produced by [[Annapurna Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldberg|first1=Lesley|title=Carrie Brownstein Adapting Her Memoir as Hulu Comedy Pilot|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/carrie-brownstein-adapting-her-memoir-as-hulu-comedy-pilot-1074036|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=January 11, 2018|language=en|date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|title=Hulu Orders ‘Search &amp; Destroy’ Comedy Pilot From Carrie Brownstein &amp; Annapurna|url=http://deadline.com/2018/01/carrie-brownstein-search-destroy-based-hunger-makes-me-a-modern-girl-memoir-pilot-hulu-1202240837/|website=Deadline|accessdate=January 11, 2018|date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 8, 2018, it was announced that [[Taylor Dearden]] and [[Aubrey Peeples]] had been cast in the show's lead roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldberg|first1=Lesley|title=Hulu's Carrie Brownstein Comedy Finds Leads in Taylor Dearden, Aubrey Peeples|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/hulus-carrie-brownstein-comedy-finds-leads-taylor-dearden-aubrey-peeples-1093201|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=March 9, 2018|language=en|date=March 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 18, 2018, it was reported that [[Brad Morris]], Leah Harvey, [[Jessica Hecht]], and Imogen Tear had joined the main cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petski|first1=Denise|title=‘Search and Destroy’: Hulu’s Carrie Brownstein Comedy Pilot Adds Four To Cast|url=http://deadline.com/2018/05/search-and-destroy-hulu-carrie-brownstein-comedy-pilot-cast-brad-morris-leah-harvey-jessica-hecht-imogen-tear-1202393535/|website=Deadline|accessdate=May 18, 2018|date=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5933">A poem known variously as the "'''Indian Wedding Blessing'''", "'''Apache Blessing'''", "'''Apache Wedding Prayer'''", "'''Benediction of the Apaches''', "'''Cherokee Wedding Blessing'''",&lt;ref name=ImageResultsCherokee&gt;"[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Cherokee+Wedding+Blessing%22&amp;safe=active&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF5bH6jd_TAhWKOyYKHSDTDoUQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=609&amp;dpr=1.5 Cherokee Wedding Blessing]" on [[Google Images]]&lt;/ref&gt; and with various forms, is commonly recited at [[Wedding_customs_by_country#United_States_customs|weddings in the United States]]. The poem is of modern non-Native origin, and is cited as an example of [[fakelore]] (fake folklore).&lt;ref name=falk&gt;{{cite web
|title=The Fakelore of the Apache Wedding Blessing

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem was originally written in 1947 by the non-Native author [[Elliott Arnold]] in his [[Western (genre)|Western]] novel ''Blood Brother''. The novel features [[Apache]] culture, but the poem itself is an invention of the author's, and is not based on any traditions of the [[Apache]], [[Cherokee]] or any other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Blood Brothers'', 1979, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HZwBDetIsrIC&amp;pg=PP11&amp;q=%22Apache%20wedding%22 introduction]: “There is no record of [Jeffords and an Apache girl] ever marrying, but… knowing the basically simple process of an Apache wedding, I have taken a writer’s liberty and imagined that such a wedding took place. The entire story of Jeffords and [the Apache girl] Sonseeahray is pure fiction and every detail of it was invented, against a known historical background.”&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was popularized by the 1950 film adaptation of the novel, ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'', scripted by [[Albert Maltz]], and the depiction of the marriage is criticized as a "Hollywood fantasy" ([[Hollywood Indian]] stereotype).&lt;ref&gt;Mead, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MgR1qHN4PDUC&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;vq=hollywood&amp;pg=PA136#v=snippet&amp;q=hollywood&amp;f=false p. 136]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poem==
The poem, in its original form in the 1947 novel, begins:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|last=Arnold
|year=1947
|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5kxEAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Now+for+you+there+is+no+rain%22 408]

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Now for you there is no rain
For one is shelter to the other.
Now for you there is no sun
for one is shelter to the other.
Now for you nothing is hard or bad,
For the hardness and badness is taken by one for the other.&lt;/poem&gt;
}}
...and ends "Now there is no loneliness. / Now, forever, forever, there is no loneliness". The poem is not associated with any particular [[religion]] (aside from being misrepresented as Native American) and does not mention a [[deity]] or include a petition, only a wish.

The 1950 film text begins "Now you will feel no rain" and ends "Go now. Ride the white horses to your secret place."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UxeZti4C_M Broken Arrow Full Movie 1950]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are now numerous variations of the poem, generally based on the film, rather than the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Mead p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; One modern form is:&lt;ref name="falk"/&gt;
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Now you will feel no rain, for each of you will be shelter for the other.
Now you will feel no cold, for each of you will be warmth to the other.
Now there will be no loneliness, for each of you will be companion to the other.
Now you are two persons, but there is only one life before you.
May beauty surround you both in the journey ahead and through all the years.
May happiness be your companion and your days together be good and long upon the earth.&lt;/poem&gt;
}}

==Criticism==

The ''[[Economist]],'' citing Rebecca Mead's book on American weddings,&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Mead, ''One Perfect Day: The Selling of the American Wedding'', 2007, {{ISBN|1-59420-088-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; characterized it as "'traditionalesque', commerce disguised as tradition".&lt;ref&gt;"American weddings: Beware the bridezilla monster", ''The Economist.'' May 26, 2007. Vol. 383, Issue 8530, p. 99. (A review of the book ''One Perfect Day: The Selling of the American Wedding.'' By Rebecca Mead. Penguin Press.) [http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9218103 full text] (available to subscribers only)&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem has gained even wider exposure as a series of [[Internet memes]], often accompanied by [[Ethnic stereotype|stereotypical depictions]] of [[Stereotypes about indigenous peoples of North America |Native Americans]] depicted as [[Noble savage]]s.&lt;ref name=ImageResultsNA&gt;"[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Indian+Wedding+Blessing%22&amp;safe=active&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy853Khd_TAhULfiYKHdpnB2EQsAQIJg&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=609 Indian Wedding Blessing]" on [[Google Images]]&lt;/ref&gt; That it is continually misrepresented as Apache, Cherokee, or generic "Native American" is an example of both [[cultural appropriation|cultural misappropriation]] and modern [[fakelore]].&lt;ref name=ImageResultsCherokee/&gt;&lt;ref name=ImageResultsApache&gt;"[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Apache+Wedding+Blessing%22&amp;safe=active&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwip9uXijd_TAhUB7SYKHX2ABrMQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=584 Apache Wedding Blessing]" on [[Google Images]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intertextuality''' is the shaping of a text's meaning by another text. It is the interconnection between similar or related works of literature that reflect and influence an audience's interpretation of the text. Intertextual figures include: [[allusion]], [[quotation]], [[calque]], [[plagiarism]], [[translation]], ''[[pastiche]]'' and [[parody]].&lt;ref name="Genette97"&gt;[[Gerard Genette]] (1997) ''Paratexts'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=AmWhQzemk2EC&amp;pg=PR18 p.18]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hallo2010"&gt;Hallo, William W. (2010) ''The World's Oldest Literature: Studies in Sumerian Belles-Lettres'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=WjNqb1G88b0C&amp;pg=PA608 p.608]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cancogni1985"&gt;Cancogni, Annapaola (1985) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XLOwAAAAIAAJ ''The Mirage in the Mirror: Nabokov's Ada and Its French Pre-Texts''] pp.203-213&lt;/ref&gt; Intertextuality is a literary device that creates an 'interrelationship between texts' and generates related understanding in separate works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/intertextuality "Definition of Intertextuality"], "Dictionary.com", Retrieved on 15 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; These references are made to influence the reader and add layers of depth to a text, based on the readers' prior knowledge and understanding. Intertextuality is a literary discourse strategy utilised by writers in novels, poetry, theatre and even in non-written texts (such as performances and digital media).&lt;ref&gt;Gadavanij, Savitri. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.484.8982&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf "Intertextuality as Discourse Strategy"], School of Language and Communication, Retrieved 15 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of intertextuality are an author's borrowing and transformation of a prior text, and a reader's referencing of one text in reading another.

Intertextuality does not require citing or referencing punctuation (such as quotation marks) and is often mistaken for plagiarism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Writing and identity: The discoursal construction of identity in academic writing|last=Ivanic|first=Roz|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Co.|year=1998|isbn=|location=Amsterdam, Netherlands|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intertextuality can be produced in texts using a variety of functions including allusion, quotation and referencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Intertextuality, Allusion, and Quotation: An International Bibliography of Critical Studies (Bibliographies and Indexes in World Literature)|last=Hebel|first=Udo J|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0313265174|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, intertextuality is not always intentional and can be utilised inadvertently.
As philosopher [[William Irwin (philosopher)|William Irwin]] wrote, the term "has come to have almost as many meanings as users, from those faithful to [[Julia Kristeva]]'s original vision to those who simply use it as a stylish way of talking about [[allusion]] and [[Social influence|influence]]".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Irwin,2, October 2004, pp. 227–242, 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:ulyssesCover.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Joyce]]'s 1922 novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' bears an intertextual relationship to [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''.]]
[[Julia Kristeva]] was the first to coin the term "intertextuality" in an attempt to synthesize [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s  [[semiotics]]—his study of how [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] derive their meaning within the structure of a text—with Bakhtin's [[dialogic|dialogism]]—his theory which suggests a continual dialogue with other works of literature and other authors—and his examination of the multiple meanings, or "[[heteroglossia]]", in each text (especially novels) and in each word.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For Kristeva,&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, Julia. Desire in Language: A Semiotic Approach to Literature and Art. New York: Columbia University Press, 1980, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; "the notion of intertextuality replaces the notion of "[[intersubjectivity]]" when we realize that meaning is not transferred directly from writer to reader but instead is mediated through, or filtered by, "codes" imparted to the writer and reader by other texts. For example, when we read [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' we decode it as a [[modernist]] literary experiment, or as a response to the epic tradition, or as part of some other [[conversation]], or as part of all of these conversations at once. This intertextual view of literature, as shown by [[Roland Barthes]], supports the concept that the meaning of a text does not reside in the text, but is produced by the reader in relation not only to the text in question, but also the complex network of texts invoked in the reading process.

While the theoretical concept of intertextuality is associated with [[post-modernism]], the device itself is not new. [[New Testament]] passages quote from the [[Old Testament]] and Old Testament books such as [[Deuteronomy]] or the [[prophet]]s refer to the events described in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] (for discussions on using 'intertextuality' to describe the use of the Old Testament in the New Testament, see Porter 1997; Oropeza 2013; Oropeza &amp; Moyise, 2016). Whereas a redaction critic would use such intertextuality to argue for a particular order and process of the authorship of the books in question, [[literary criticism]] takes a synchronic view that deals with the texts in their final form, as an interconnected body of [[literature]]. This interconnected body extends to later poems and paintings that refer to Biblical narratives, just as other texts build networks around Greek and Roman [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] history and mythology. Bullfinch's 1855 work ''[[The Age Of Fable]]'' served as an introduction to such an intertextual network;{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} according to its author, it was intended "...for the reader of English literature, of either sex, who wishes to comprehend the allusions so frequently made by public speakers, lecturers, essayists, and poets...".

Even the nomenclature "new" and "old" (testament) reframes the real context that the Jewish [[Torah]] had been usurped by followers of a new faith wishing to co-opt the original one. {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} 

Sometimes intertextuality is taken as [[plagiarism]] as in the case of Spanish writer [[Lucía Etxebarria]] whose poem collection ''Estación de infierno'' (2001) was found to contain metaphors and verses from [[Antonio Colinas]].
Etxebarria claimed that she admired him and applied intertextuality.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

More recent [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] theory, such as that formulated in Daniela Caselli's ''[[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]'s [[Dante]]s: Intertextuality in the Fiction and Criticism'' (MUP 2005), re-examines "intertextuality" as a production within texts, rather than as a series of relationships between different texts. Some postmodern theorists &lt;ref&gt;Gerard Genette, ''Palimpsests: literature in the second degree'', Channa Newman and Claude Doubinsky (trans.), University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln NE and London.&lt;/ref&gt; like to talk about the relationship between "intertextuality" and "[[hypertext]]uality" (not to be confused with [[Hypertext (semiotics)|hypertext]], another semiotic term coined by [[Gérard Genette]]); intertextuality makes each text a "living hell of hell on earth" &lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; and part of a larger mosaic of texts, just as each [[hypertext]] can be a web of links and part of the whole [[World-Wide Web]]. The [[World-Wide Web]] has been theorized as a unique realm of reciprocal intertextuality, in which no particular text can claim centrality, yet the Web text eventually produces an image of a community—the group of people who write and read the text using specific discursive strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitra|first=Ananda|year=1999|title=Characteristics of the WWW Text: Tracing Discursive Strategies|url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol5/issue1/mitra.html|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume=5|issue=1|page=1|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.1999.tb00330.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One can also make distinctions between the notions of "intertext", "hypertext" and "supertext".{{Citation needed|reason=supertext is not a term in Wikipedia; what does it mean?|date=August 2014}} Take for example the ''[[Dictionary of the Khazars]]'' by [[Milorad Pavić (writer)|Milorad Pavić]]. As an intertext, it employs quotations from the scriptures of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s. As a hypertext, it consists of links to different articles within itself and also every individual trajectory of reading it. As a supertext, it combines male and female versions of itself, as well as three mini-dictionaries in each of the versions.

== Examples in literature ==
Some examples of intertextuality in literature include:
* ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'' (1952) by [[John Steinbeck]]: A retelling of the account of Genesis, set in the Salinas Valley of Northern California.
* ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) by [[James Joyce]]: A retelling of Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', set in Dublin.
* ''[[Earthly Powers]]'' (1980) by [[Anthony Burgess]]: A retelling of [[Anatole France]]'s Le Miracle du grand saint Nicolas during the 20th century.
* ''[[The Dead Fathers Club]]'' (2006) by [[Matt Haig]]: A retelling of Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'', set in modern England.
* ''[[A Thousand Acres]]'' (1991) by [[Jane Smiley]]: A retelling of Shakespeare's ''[[King Lear]]'', set in rural Iowa.
* ''[[Perelandra]]'' (1943) by [[C. S. Lewis]]: Another retelling of the account of Genesis, also leaning on Milton's [[Paradise Lost]], but set on the planet Venus.
* ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]'' (1966) by [[Jean Rhys]]: A [[textual intervention]] on [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', the story of the "[[Bertha Mason|mad woman in the attic]]" told from her perspective.
* ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]'' (1996) by [[Steven Pressfield]]: A retelling of the Bhagavad Gita, set in 1931 during an epic golf game.
* ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' (1996) by [[Helen Fielding]]: A modern [[chick lit]] romantic comedy replaying and referencing [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''.
* ''[[Tortilla Flat]]'' (1935) by [[John Steinbeck]]: A retelling of the Arthurian legends, set in ''[[Monterey, CA]]'' during the interwar period.
* ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' (1931) by [[Eugene O'Neill]]: A retelling of Aeschylus' ''[[The Oresteia]]'', set in post-American Civil War New England.

== Types ==
Intertextuality and intertextual relationships can be separated into three types: obligatory, optional and accidental.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moodle.cqu.edu.au|title=Romantic and contemporary poetry: readings|last=Fitzsimmons|first=John|date=2013|website=moodle.cqu.edu.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These variations depend on two key factors: the intention of the writer, and the significance of the reference.  The distinctions between these types and those differences between categories are not absolute and exclusive but instead, are manipulated in a way that allows them to co-exist within the same text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56657010|title=Shakespeare, Italy, and intertextuality|date=2004|publisher=Manchester University Press|others=Marrapodi, Michele.|isbn=9780719066672|location=Manchester|oclc=56657010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obligatory===
Obligatory intertextuality is when the writer deliberately invokes a comparison or association between two (or more) texts. Without this pre-understanding or success to 'grasp the link', the reader's understanding of the text is regarded as inadequate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Obligatory intertextuality relies on the reading or understanding of a prior hypotext, before full comprehension of the hypertext can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobmeyer, Hannah. [http://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/edoc/ia/eese/artic98/jacobm/88_98.html "Ever After: A study in intertextuality"], Carl Hanser Verlag, 1998. Retrieved on 15 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As an example, Maria Mitchell analyzes the obligatory intertexuality of Tom Stoppard's 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead' with Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Marea|date=2007|title=Hamlet and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead: transformations and adaptation.|url=https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/hamlet-and-rosencrantz-and-guildenstern-are-dead-transformations-|journal=Sydney Studies in English|volume=33|pages=39-55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in Hamlet where we first meet Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and as the plot of ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead'' unravels, specific scenes from Hamlet are actually performed and viewed from a different perspective. According to Mitchell, this understanding of the hypotext Hamlet, gives deeper meaning to the pretext as many of the implicit themes from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are more recognizable.

===Optional===
Optional intertextuality has a less vital impact on the significance of the hypertext. It is a possible, but not essential, intertextual relationship that if recognized, the connection will slightly shift the understanding of the text.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Optional Intertextuality means it is possible to find a connection to multiple texts of a single phrase, or no connection at all.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The intent of the writer when using optional intertextuality, is to pay homage to the 'original' writers, or to reward those who have read the hypotext. However, the reading of this hypotext is not necessary to the understanding of the hypertext.

The use of optional intertextuality may be something as simple as parallel characters or plotlines. According to Emily Keller, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series shares many similarities with J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Keller says that they both apply the use of an aging wizard mentor (Professor Dumbledore and Gandalf) and a key friendship group is formed to assist the protagonist (an innocent young boy) on their arduous quest to defeat a powerful wizard and to destroy a powerful being.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, Emily. [http://www.jmu.edu/evision/Volume10/Keller.html "Crafting a Masterpiece: The Genre Mosaic of Harry Potter"] e-Vision, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accidental===
Accidental intertextuality is when readers often connect a text with another text, cultural practice or a personal experience, without there being any tangible anchorpoint within the original text.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The writer has no intention of making an intertextual reference and it is completely upon the reader's own prior knowledge that these connections are made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/961557000|title=Perspectives on the formation of the Book of the Twelve : methodological foundations, redactional processes, historical insights|others=Albertz, Rainer, 1943-, Nogalski, James., Wöhrle, Jakob.|isbn=9783110283761|location=Berlin|oclc=961557000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often when reading a book or viewing a film a memory will be triggered in the viewers' mind. For example, when reading Herman Melville's 'Moby Dick', a reader may use his or her prior experiences to make a connection between the size of the whale and the size of the ship.

==Competing terms==
Some critics have complained that the ubiquity of the term "intertextuality" in postmodern criticism has crowded out related terms and important nuances. Irwin (227) laments that intertextuality has eclipsed [[allusion]] as an object of literary study while lacking the latter term's clear definition.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Linda Hutcheon]] argues that excessive interest in intertextuality rejects the role of the author, because intertextuality can be found "in the eye of the beholder" and does not entail a communicator's intentions. By contrast, in ''A Theory of Parody'' Hutcheon notes [[parody]] always features an author who actively encodes a text as an imitation with critical difference.&lt;ref&gt;Hutcheon, Linda. A Theory of Parody: The Teachings of Twentieth-Century Art Forms. New York: Methuen, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have also been attempts at more closely defining different types of intertextuality. The Australian media scholar [[John Fiske (media scholar)|John Fiske]] has made a distinction between what he labels 'vertical' and 'horizontal' intertextuality. Horizontal intertextuality denotes references that are on the 'same level' i.e. when books make references to other books, whereas vertical intertextuality is found when, say, a book makes a reference to film or song or vice versa.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011|reason=Which Fiske does this come from?}} Similarly, Linguist [[Norman Fairclough]] distinguishes between 'manifest intertextuality' and 'constitutive intertextuality'.&lt;ref&gt;Fairclough, Norman (1992). Discourse and Social Change. Cambridge: Polity Press, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The former signifies intertextual elements such as presupposition, negation, parody, irony, etc. The latter signifies the interrelationship of discursive features in a text, such as structure, form, or genre. Constitutive Intertextuality is also referred to [[interdiscourse|interdiscursivity]],&lt;ref&gt;Agger, Gunhild Intertextuality Revisited: Dialogues and Negotiations in Media Studies. Canadian Journal of Aesthetics, 4, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; though, generally  [[interdiscourse|interdiscursivity]] refers to relations between larger formations of texts.

=== Related concepts ===
Linguist Norman Fairclough states that "intertextuality is a matter of [[recontextualization]]".&lt;ref&gt;Fairclough, Norman. ''Analysing Discourse: Textual Analysis for Social Research.'' New York: Routledge, 2003, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Per Linell, recontextualization can be defined as the "dynamic transfer-and-transformation of something from one discourse/text-in-context ... to another".&lt;ref&gt;Linell, Per. "Discourse across boundaries: On recontextualizations and the blending of voices in professional discourse," ''Text'', 18, 1998, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Recontextualization can be relatively explicit—for example, when one text directly quotes another—or relatively implicit—as when the "same" generic meaning is rearticulated across different texts.&lt;ref name="Oddo2014"&gt;Oddo, John. ''Intertextuality and the 24-Hour News Cycle: A Day in the Rhetorical Life of Colin Powell's U.N. Address.'' East Lansing, MI: Michigan State University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|132–133}}

A number of scholars have observed that recontextualization can have important ideological and political consequences. For instance, Adam Hodges has studied how White House officials recontextualized and altered a military general's comments for political purposes, highlighting favorable aspects of the general's utterances while downplaying the damaging aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, Adam. "The Politics of Recontextualization: Discursive Competition over Claims of Iranian Involvement in Iraq, " ''Discourse &amp; Society'', 19(4), 2008, 483-505.&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetorical scholar Jeanne Fahnestock has found that when popular magazines recontextualize scientific research they enhance the uniqueness of the scientific findings and confer greater certainty on the reported facts.&lt;ref&gt;Fahnestock, Jeanne. "Accommodating Science: The Rhetorical life of Scientific Facts," ''Written Communication'', 3(3), 1986, 275-296.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, John Oddo stated that American reporters covering Colin Powell's 2003 U.N. speech transformed Powell's discourse as they recontextualized it, bestowing Powell's allegations with greater certainty and warrantability and even adding new evidence to support Powell's claims.&lt;ref name="Oddo2014" /&gt;

Oddo has also argued that recontextualization has a future-oriented counterpoint, which he dubs "precontextualization".&lt;ref&gt;Oddo, John. "Precontextualization and the Rhetoric of Futurity:  Foretelling Colin Powell's U.N. Address on NBC News," ''Discourse &amp; Communication'', 7(1), 2013, 25-53.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Oddo, precontextualization is a form of anticipatory intertextuality wherein "a text introduces and predicts elements of a symbolic event that is yet to unfold".&lt;ref name="Oddo2014" /&gt;{{rp|78}} For example, Oddo contends, American journalists anticipated and previewed Colin Powell's U.N. address, drawing his future discourse into the normative present.

===Allusion===
While intertextuality is a complex and multileveled literary term, it is often confused with the more casual term 'allusion'. Allusion is a passing or casual reference; an incidental mention of something, either directly or by implication.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/plagiarism|title=the definition of plagiarism|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means it is most closely linked to both obligatory and accidental intertextuality, as the 'allusion' made relies on the listener or viewer knowing about the original source. It is also seen as accidental, however, as they are normally phrases that are so frequently or casually used, that the true significance of the words is not fully appreciated. Allusion is most often used in conversation, dialogue or metaphor. For example, "I was surprised his nose was not growing like Pinocchio's." This makes a reference to ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', written by [[Carlo Collodi]] when the little wooden puppet lies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/allusion|title=Allusion dictionary definition {{!}} allusion defined|website=www.yourdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this was obligatory intertextuality in a text, multiple references to this (or other novels of the same theme) would be used throughout the hypertext.

==Plagiarism==
"Intertextuality is an area of considerable ethical complexity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Share|first=Perry|date=January 2005|title=Managing intertextuality–meaning, plagiarism and power|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228770980_Managing_intertextuality-meaning_plagiarism_and_power|journal=ResearchGate|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As intertextuality, by definition, involves the (sometimes) purposeful use of other's work without proper citation, it is often mistaken for plagiarism. Plagiarism is the act of "using or closely imitating the language and thoughts of another author without authorization-".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Whilst this does seem to include intertextuality, the intention and purpose of using of another's work, is what allows intertextuality to be excluded from this definition. When using intertextuality, it is usually a small excerpt of a hypotext that assists in the understanding of the new hypertext's original themes, characters or contexts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They use a part of another text and change its meaning by placing it in a different context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jabri|first=Muayyad|date=December 2003|title=Change as shifting identities: a dialogic perspective|url=http://www.msu.ac.zw/elearning/material/temp/1372165169dialogism%20-%20identities.pdf|journal=Journal of Organizational Change Management|volume=17|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that they are using other's ideas to create or enhance their own new ideas, not simply plagiarising them. Intertextuality is based on the 'creation of new ideas', whilst plagiarism is often found in projects based on research to confirm your ideas.

== Non-literary uses ==
In addition, the concept of intertextuality has been used analytically outside the sphere of literature and art. For example, Christensen (2016) &lt;ref&gt;Christensen, L.R. (2016). On Intertext in Chemotherapy: an Ethnography of Text in Medical Practice. Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW): The Journal of Collaborative Computing and Work Practices. Volume 25, Issue 1, pp 1-38&lt;/ref&gt; introduces the concept of intertextuality to the analysis of work practice at a hospital. The study shows that the ensemble of documents used and produced at a hospital department can be said to form a corpus of written texts. On the basis of the corpus, or subsections thereof, the actors in cooperative work create intertext between relevant (complementary) texts in a particular situation, for a particular purpose. The intertext of a particular situation can be constituted by several kinds of intertextuality, including the complementary type, the intratextual type and the mediated type. In this manner the concept of intertext has had an impact beyond literature and art studies.

The word '''Ivoirité''' ({{IPA-fr|i.vwa.ʁi.te}}; sometimes translated into English as ''Ivoirity'') was first used by [[Henri Konan Bédié]] in 1995. It initially referred to the common cultural identity of all those living in [[Côte d'Ivoire]], especially foreigners in [[Ivory Coast]] (who represent one third of the population). 

During the Presidency of [[Henri Konan Bédié]], however, the term entered the social and political lexicon of the country, and was used as a descriptor of the purported intrinsic characteristics of an indigenous Ivorian, in contrast to immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Woods (2003) The Tragedy of the Cocoa Pod: Rent-Seeking, Land and Ethnic Conflict in Ivory Coast&lt;/ref&gt; During Bedie's presidency, ethnic tensions rose sharply, with growing attacks on foreign workers and a widening rift between the country's pre-dominantly Muslim north and mainly Christian south. His government tried to define who was Ivorian. 

Nationalist and [[xenophobic]] ideas fanned by politics and the press further cemented it to mean population from this Christian South and East of the country. Before the 1995 and the 2000 elections, a law quickly drafted by the president Henri Konan Bédié and upheld by the Supreme Court required both parents of a presidential candidate to be born within Côte d'Ivoire. This led to the disqualification of the northern presidential candidate [[Alassane Ouattara]], who claimed to represent the predominantly [[Muslim]] north, often poor immigrant workers from [[Mali]] and [[Burkina Faso]] working on [[coffee]] and [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]] plantations. [[Alassane Ouattara]], an economist who worked for the [[IMF]], was the Prime Minister of Côte d'Ivoire under the President Félix Houphouët-Boigny.

This word is associated with the [[civil war in Côte d'Ivoire]] that occurred in 2010-2011, in which at least 3,000 civilians were killed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ecoi.net/de/dokument/1430118.html&lt;/ref&gt;

They have been accused of conducting a series of [[human rights abuse]]s against civilians and prisoners of war throughout [[East Asia]] and the western [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] region. These events reached their height during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] of 1937–45 and the [[Pacific War|Asian and Pacific campaigns of World War II]] (1941–45). In addition to Japanese civil and military personnel, Koreans and Taiwanese who were forced to serve in the military of the Empire of Japan were also found to have committed war crimes as part of the Japanese Imperial Army.&lt;ref name="Harmsen, Peter 2012, p. 4"&gt;Harmsen, Peter, [[Jiji Press]], "Taiwanese seeks payback for brutal service in Imperial Army", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 26 September 2012, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Breen"&gt;{{cite web|work=The Korea Times|title=Truth Commission Should Be Truthful|first=Michael|last=Breen|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200611/kt2006111619251454330.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216020355/http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200611/kt2006111619251454330.htm|archivedate=2007-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International and Japanese law===
Japan did not sign the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on the Prisoners of War]] (except the [[Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on the Sick and Wounded]]),&lt;ref name="icrc.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/States.xsp?xp_viewStates=XPages_NORMStatesParties&amp;xp_treatySelected=300 |title=Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field.

For example, many of the crimes committed by Japanese personnel during World War II broke Japanese [[military law]], and were subject to [[court martial]], as required by that law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yale.edu/gsp/publications/WaiKeng.doc See, for example: Wai Keng Kwok, 2001, "Justice Done?

"Class B" war criminals were those found guilty of war crimes ''per se'', and "Class C" war criminals were those guilty of [[crimes against humanity]]. The Japanese government also accepted the terms set by the [[Potsdam Declaration]] (1945) after the end of the war, including the provision in Article 10 of punishment for "all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners".

Japanese law does not define those convicted in the post-1945 trials as criminals, despite the fact that Japan's governments have accepted the judgments made in the trials, and in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] (1952). This is because the treaty does not mention the legal validity of the tribunal. Had Japan certified the legal validity of the war crimes tribunals in the San Francisco Treaty, the war crimes would have become open to appeal and overturning in Japanese courts. This would have been unacceptable in international diplomatic circles.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Current Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]] has advocated the position that Japan accepted the Tokyo tribunal and its judgements as a condition for ending the war, but that its verdicts have no relation to domestic law. According to this view, those convicted of war crimes are not criminals under Japanese law.&lt;ref name="japan-times-2006"&gt;{{cite news|title=Under Japanese law, 14 at Yasukuni not criminals: Abe |work=The Japan Times |date=October 7, 2006 |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20061007a4.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216084244/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20061007a4.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 16, 2008 |accessdate=2008-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical and geographical extent===
Outside Japan, different societies use widely different timeframes in defining Japanese war crimes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} For example, [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910|the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910]] was enforced by the Japanese military, and the Society of [[Joseon|Yi Dynasty Korea]] was switched to the political system of the [[Empire of Japan]]. Thus, North and South Korea refer to "Japanese war crimes" as events occurring during the period of [[Korea under Japanese rule]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

By comparison, the [[Allies of World War I|Western Allies]] did not come into military conflict with Japan until 1941, and [[North Americans]], [[Australia]]ns, [[South East Asia]]ns and [[Europe]]ans may consider "Japanese war crimes" to be events that occurred in 1942–1945.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1979/nov-dec/symonds.html Craig Symonds, "War, Politics, and Grand Strategy in the Pacific, 1941–1945", ''Air University Review'', November–December 1979] (Access date: February 15, 2007): "most American historians, date the war from December 1941".

==Background==

===Japanese military culture and imperialism===
{{Main|Statism in Shōwa Japan|Japanese militarism|Eugenics in Japan|Ethnic issues in Japan}}

Military culture, especially during Japan's imperialist phase, had great bearing on the conduct of the Japanese military before and during [[World War II]]. After the [[Meiji Restoration]] and the collapse of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], the [[Japanese Emperor|Emperor]] became the focus of military loyalty. During the so-called "Age of Empire" in the late 19th century, Japan followed the lead of other world powers in developing an empire, pursuing that objective aggressively.

Unlike many other major powers, Japan had not signed the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|Geneva Convention]]—also known as the Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Geneva July 27, 1929—which was the version of the Geneva Convention that covered the treatment of prisoners of war during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cicr.org/ihl.nsf/WebSign?ReadForm&amp;id=305&amp;ps=P |title=ICRC databases on international humanitarian law |publisher=Cicr.org |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Japan ratified the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] which contained provisions regarding prisoners of war&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Forgotten Captives in Japanese-Occupied Asia (Routledge Studies in the Modern History of Asia) |editors=Kevin Blackburn and Karl Hack |date=October 13, 2011 |page=12 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-415-69005-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an Imperial Proclamation (1894) stated that Japanese soldiers should make every effort to win the war without violating international law. According to historian [[Yuki Tanaka (historian)|Yuki Tanaka]], Japanese forces during the First Sino-Japanese War, released 1,790 Chinese prisoners without harm, once they signed an agreement not to take up arms against Japan again.&lt;ref name="Tanaka Hidden Horrors pp72-73"&gt;Tanaka ''Hidden Horrors'' pp.&amp;nbsp;72–73&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–05), all 79,367 [[Russian Empire]] prisoners were released and were paid for labour performed, in accordance with the Hague Convention.&lt;ref name="Tanaka Hidden Horrors pp72-73"/&gt; Similarly the behaviour of the Japanese military in [[World War I]] (1914–18) was at least as humane as that of other militaries, {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} with some German POWs of the Japanese finding life in Japan so agreeable that they stayed and settled in Japan after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |title=German-POW camp reveals little-known history of Japan |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0XPQ/is_/ai_59198009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216075736/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0XPQ/is_/ai_59198009 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 16, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Kyodo News]] |date=January 31, 2000 |accessdate=2008-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Japanese POW camp was a little slice of home |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2004/03/23/2003107480|work= |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=March 23, 2004 |accessdate=2008-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The events of the 1930s and 1940s===
By the late 1930s, the rise of militarism in Japan created at least superficial similarities between the wider Japanese military culture and that of [[Nazi Germany]]'s elite military personnel, such as those in the ''[[Waffen-SS]]''. Japan also had a military [[secret police]] force within the [[Imperial Japanese Army|IJA]], known as the ''[[Kempeitai]]'', which resembled the Nazi ''[[Gestapo]]'' in its role in annexed and occupied countries, but which had existed for nearly a decade before [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] own birth.&lt;ref&gt;Lamong-Brown, Raymond. "Kempeitai: Japan's Dreaded Military Police". Sutton Publishing, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
Perceived failure or insufficient devotion to the Emperor would attract punishment, frequently of the physical kind.&lt;ref name="toland301"&gt;[[John Toland (author)|John Toland]], ''[[The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936–1945]]''. p. 301. Random House. New York. 1970&lt;/ref&gt; In the military, officers would assault and beat men under their command, who would pass the beating on to lower ranks, all the way down. In POW camps, this meant prisoners received the worst beatings of all,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Jong|first=Louis|authorlink= Loe de Jong|others=translation J. Kilian, C. Kist and J.

==Crimes==
The Japanese military during the 1930s and 1940s is often compared to the military of [[Nazi Germany]] during 1933–45 because of the sheer scale of suffering that both of them caused. Much of the controversy regarding Japan's role in World War II revolves around the death rates of prisoners of war and civilians under Japanese occupation. Historian [[Sterling Seagrave]] has written that:

{{quote| Arriving at a probable number of Japan’s war victims who died is difficult for several interesting reasons, which have to do with Western perceptions. Both Americans and Europeans fell into the unfortunate habit of seeing WW1 and WW2 as separate wars, failing to comprehend that they were interlaced in a multitude of ways (not merely that one was the consequence of the other, or of the rash behavior of the victors after WW1). Wholly aside from this basic misconception, most Americans think of WW2 in Asia as having begun with Pearl Harbor, the British with the fall of Singapore, and so forth. The Chinese would correct this by identifying the Marco Polo Bridge incident as the start, or the Japanese seizure of Manchuria earlier. It really began in 1895 with Japan’s assassination of Korea’s Queen Min, and invasion of Korea, resulting in its absorption into Japan, followed quickly by Japan’s seizure of southern Manchuria, etc. – establishing that Japan was at war from 1895–1945. Prior to 1895, Japan had only briefly invaded Korea during the Shogunate, long before the Meiji Restoration, and the invasion failed. Therefore, Rummel’s estimate of 6-million to 10-million dead between 1937 (the [[Rape of Nanjing]]) and 1945, may be roughly corollary to the time-frame of the Nazi Holocaust, but it falls far short of the actual numbers killed by the Japanese war machine. If you add, say, 2-million Koreans, 2-million Manchurians, Chinese, Russians, many East European Jews (both Sephardic and Ashkenazi), and others killed by Japan between 1895 and 1937 (conservative figures), the total of Japanese victims is more like 10-million to 14-million. Of these, I would suggest that between 6-million and 8-million were ethnic Chinese, regardless of where they were resident.&lt;ref name=sterling&gt;{{cite news|url=http://educationforum.ipbhost.com/index.php?showtopic=9196|title=Sterling and Peggy Seagrave: Gold Warriors}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Attacks on neutral powers===

Article 1 of the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]] ''III – The Opening of Hostilities'' prohibited the initiation of hostilities against neutral powers "without previous and explicit warning, in the form either of a reasoned [[declaration of war]] or of an [[ultimatum]] with conditional declaration of war" and Article 2 further stated that "[t]he existence of a state of war must be notified to the neutral Powers without delay, and shall not take effect in regard to them until after the receipt of a notification, which may, however, be given by telegraph." Japanese diplomats intended to deliver the notice to the United States thirty minutes before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, but it was delivered to the U.S. government an hour after the attack was over. Tokyo transmitted the 5,000-word notification (commonly called the "14-Part Message") in two blocks to the [[Japanese Ambassador to the United States|Japanese Embassy in Washington]], but transcribing the message took too long for the Japanese ambassador to deliver it in time.&lt;ref&gt;Toland, ''Infamy''&lt;/ref&gt; The 14-Part Message was actually about sending a message to U.S. officials that peace negotiations between Japan and the U.S. were likely to be terminated, not a declaration of war. In fact, Japanese officials were well aware that the 14-Part Message was not a proper declaration of war as required by the 1907 Hague Convention ''III – The Opening of Hostilities''. They decided not to issue a proper declaration of war anyway as they feared that doing so would expose the possible leak of the secret operation to the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2006_fall/iguchi.htm |title=Japan's Military Stopped Warning of Pearl Harbor Attack, Says Iguchi |access-date=2014-01-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201191435/http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2006_fall/iguchi.htm |archive-date=2014-02-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearl Harbor"&gt;[http://faculty.virginia.edu/setear/students/japanwc/Home.html Pearl Harbor and The Tokyo Trials]&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]] charged that [[U.S. President|President]] [[Franklin D.

Simultaneously with the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 (Honolulu time), Japan invaded the British colonies of [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]] and bombed [[Bombing of Singapore (1941)|Singapore]] and began land actions in [[Battle of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], without a declaration of war or an ultimatum. Both the U.S. and Britain were neutral when Japan attacked their territories without explicit warning of a state of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Britain, Japan and Pearl Harbour: Avoiding War in East Asia, 1936–1941 |author=Antony Best |date=August 1, 1995 |page=1 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-415-11171-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Study "Riposte": Analytical papers |author=|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keenan]], the chief prosecutor in the Tokyo Trials, says that the attack on Pearl Harbor not only happened without a declaration of war but was also a [[Betrayal|treacherous]] and [[deceitful]] act. In fact, Japan and the U.S. were still negotiating for a possible peace agreement which kept U.S. officials very distracted when Japanese planes bombed Pearl Harbor. Keenan explained the definition of a war of aggression and the criminality of the attack on Pearl Harbor:

{{quote|The concept of aggressive war may not be expressed with the precision of a scientific formula, or described like the objective data of the physical sciences. Aggressive War is not entirely a physical fact to be observed and defined like the operation of the laws of matter. It is rather an activity involving injustice between nations, rising to the level of criminality because of its disastrous effects upon the common good of international society. The injustice of a war of aggression is criminal of its extreme grosses, considered both from the point of view of the will of the aggressor to inflict injury and from the evil effects which ensue&amp;nbsp;... Unjust war are plainly crimes and not simply torts or breaches of contracts. The act comprises the willful, intentional, and unreasonable destruction of life, limb, and property, subject matter which has been regarded as criminal by the laws of all civilized peoples&amp;nbsp;... The Pearl Harbor attack breached the Kellogg–Briand Pact and the Hague Convention III. In addition, it violated Article 23 of the Annex to the Hague Convention IV, of October 1907&amp;nbsp;... But the attack of Pearl Harbor did not alone result in murder and the slaughter of thousands of human beings. It did not eventuate only in the destruction of property. It was an outright act of undermining and destroying the hope of a world for peace. When a nation employs a deceit and treachery, using periods of negotiations and the negotiations themselves as a cloak to screen a [[perfidy|perfidious]] attack, then there is a prime example of the crime of all crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, Joseph Berry and Brown, Brendan Francis, ''Crimes against International Law'', Public Affairs Press, Washington, 1950, pp.&amp;nbsp;57–87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Tokyo Transcript'', May 13, 1946, p.491&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], who planned the attack on Pearl Harbor, was fully aware that if Japan lost the war, he would be tried as a war criminal for that attack {{citation needed|date=May 2018}} (although he was killed by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] in [[Operation Vengeance]] in 1943). At the Tokyo Trials, [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Hideki Tojo]]; [[Shigenori Tōgō]], then [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Foreign Minister]]; [[Shigetarō Shimada]], the [[Ministry of the Navy of Japan|Minister of the Navy]]; and [[Osami Nagano]], [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff|Chief of Naval General Staff]], were charged with [[crimes against peace]] (charges 1 to 36) and [[murder]] (charges 37 to 52) in connection with the attack on Pearl Harbor. Along with [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] (charges 53 to 55), Tojo was among the seven Japanese leaders sentenced to death and [[executed]] by [[hanging]] in 1948, Shigenori Tōgō received a 20-year sentence, Shimada received a life sentence, and Nagano died of natural causes during the Trial in 1947.&lt;ref name="Pearl Harbor" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://werle.rewi.hu-berlin.de/tokyo.anklageschrift.pdf JUDGMENT INTERNATIONAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL FOR THE FAR EAST INDICTMENT]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, many Japanese nationalists argued that the attack on Pearl Harbor was justified as they acted in [[self-defense]] in response to the oil embargo imposed by the United States. Most historians and scholars agreed that the oil embargo cannot be used as justification for using military force against a foreign nation imposing the oil embargo because there is a clear distinction between a perception that something is essential to the welfare of the nation-state and a threat truly being sufficiently serious to warrant an act of force in response, which Japan failed to consider. Japanese scholar and diplomat, Takeo Iguchi, states that it is "[h]ard to say from the perspective of international law that exercising the right of self-defense against economic pressures is considered valid." While Japan felt that its dreams of further expansion would be brought to a screeching halt by the American embargo, this "need" cannot be considered [[Proportionality (law)|proportional]] with the destruction suffered by the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]] at Pearl Harbor, intended by Japanese military planners to be as comprehensive as possible.&lt;ref name="Pearl Harbor" /&gt;

[[R. J. Rummel]], a professor of political science at the [[University of Hawaii]], estimates that between 1937 and 1945, the Japanese military murdered from nearly 3 to over 10 million people, most likely 6 million Chinese, Koreans, Malaysians, Indonesians, Filipinos and [[Indochina|Indochinese]], among others, including Western prisoners of war. According to Rummel, "This [[democide]] [i.e., death by government] was due to a morally bankrupt political and military strategy, military expediency and custom, and national culture."&lt;ref name=rummel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP3.HTM |title=Rummell, ''Statistics'' |publisher=Hawaii.edu |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rummel, in [[China]] alone, during 1937–45, approximately 3.9 million Chinese were killed, mostly civilians, as a direct result of the Japanese operations and a total of 10.2 million Chinese were killed in the course of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE2.HTM |title=China's Bloody Century |publisher=Hawaii.edu |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most infamous incident during this period was the [[Nanking Massacre]] of 1937–38, when, according to the findings of the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], the Japanese Army massacred as many as 300,000 civilians and prisoners of war, although the accepted figure is somewhere in the hundreds of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] the Japanese followed what has been referred to as a "killing policy", including killings committed against minorities like [[Hui people|Hui Muslims]] in China. According to Wan Lei, "In a Hui clustered village in Gaocheng county of Hebei, the Japanese captured twenty Hui men among whom they only set two younger men free through "redemption", and buried alive the other eighteen Hui men. In Mengcun village of Hebei, the Japanese killed more than 1,300 Hui people within three years of their occupation of that area." Mosques were also desecrated and destroyed by the Japanese, and Hui cemeteries were also destroyed. After the [[Rape of Nanking]] mosques in Nanjing were found to be filled with dead bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=LEI |first=Wan |last2= |first2= |date=February 2010 |title=The Chinese Islamic "Goodwill Mission to the Middle East" During the Anti-Japanese War |url=https://www.academia.edu/4427135/The_Chinese_Islamic_Goodwill_Mission_to_the_Middle_East_-_Japonyaya_Karsi_Savasta_Cinli_Muslumanlarin_Orta_Dogu_iyi_Niyet_Heyeti_-_Wan_LEI |publisher= |journal=DÎVÂN DISIPLINLERARASI ÇALISMALAR DERGISI |volume= cilt 15 |issue= sayi 29 |page=|pages=139–141 |doi= |access-date=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Chinese Muslims in the Second Sino-Japanese War|Hui Chinese Muslims in the Second Sino-Japanese war fought in the war against Japan]].

In Southeast Asia, the [[Manila massacre]] of February 1945 resulted in the death of 100,000 civilians in the Philippines.

There were other massacres of civilians, e.g. the [[Kalagong massacre]]. In wartime Southeast Asia, the [[Overseas Chinese]] and [[European diaspora]] were special targets of Japanese abuse; in the former case, motivated by [[Sinophobia]] vis-à-vis the historic expanse and influence of [[Chinese culture]] that did not exist with the Southeast Asian indigenes, and the latter, motivated by a [[Racism|racist]] [[Pan-Asianism]] and a desire to show former colonial subjects the impotence of their Western masters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pan-Asianism and Japan's War 1931–1945|first=Eri|last=Hotta|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2007|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese executed all the Malay Sultans on Kalimantan and wiped out the Malay elite in the [[Pontianak incidents]].

===Human experimentation and biological warfare===
[[File:Shiro-ishii.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shirō Ishii]], commander of [[Unit 731]]]]
Special Japanese military units conducted experiments on civilians and POWs in China. One of the most infamous was [[Unit 731]] under [[Shirō Ishii]]. Unit 731 was established by order of Hirohito himself. Victims were subjected to experiments including but not limited to [[vivisection]] and amputations without anesthesia and testing of [[biological weapons]]. Anesthesia was not used because it was believed that anesthetics would adversely affect the results of the experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2D71630F934A25750C0A963958260&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print "Unmasking Horror"] Nicholas D.

{{Quote|To determine the treatment of frostbite, prisoners were taken outside in freezing weather and left with exposed arms, periodically drenched with water until frozen solid. The arm was later amputated; the doctor would repeat the process on the victim's upper arm to the shoulder.

One case of human experimentation occurred in Japan itself. At least nine out of 11 crew members survived the crash of a [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] [[bomber]] on [[Kyūshū]], on May 5, 1945. (This plane was Lt.

On March 11, 1948, 30 people, including several doctors and one female nurse, were brought to trial by the Allied war crimes tribunal. Charges of cannibalism were dropped, but 23 people were found guilty of vivisection or wrongful removal of body parts. Five were sentenced to death, four to life imprisonment, and the rest to shorter terms. In 1950, the military governor of Japan, General [[Douglas MacArthur]], commuted all of the death sentences and significantly reduced most of the prison terms. All of those convicted in relation to the university vivisection were free after 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Landas p.255&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many participants who were responsible for these vivisections were never charged by the Americans or their allies in exchange for the information on the experiments.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Use of chemical weapons===
{{See also|Changde chemical weapon attack}}

According to historians [[Yoshiaki Yoshimi]] and Kentaro Awaya, during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], [[chemical warfare|gas weapons]], such as [[tear gas]], were used only sporadically in 1937, but in early 1938 the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] began full-scale use of [[phosgene]], [[chlorine]], [[Lewisite]] and [[Chloropicrin|nausea gas]] (red), and from mid-1939, [[mustard gas]] (yellow) was used against both Kuomintang and Communist Chinese troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tanaka |first1=Yuki |title=Poison Gas: The Story Japan Would Like to Forget |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |volume=44 |issue=8 |year=2015 |pages=10–9 |doi=10.1080/00963402.1988.11456210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Yoshimi and Seiya Matsuno, [[Emperor Hirohito]] signed orders specifying the use of chemical weapons in China.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshimi and Matsuno, ''Dokugasusen kankei shiryô II, Kaisetsu'' 1997&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during the [[Battle of Wuhan]] from August to October 1938, the Emperor authorized the use of toxic gas on 375 separate occasions, despite the [[Hague Convention of 1899#Hague Convention of 1899|1899 Hague Declaration]] ''IV, 2 – Declaration on the Use of Projectiles the Object of Which is the Diffusion of Asphyxiating or Deleterious Gases''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/dec99-02.asp |title=Laws of War: Declaration on the Use of Projectiles the Object of Which is the Diffusion of Asphyxiating or Deleterious Gases; July 29, 1899 |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Article 23 (a) of the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]] ''IV – The Laws and Customs of War on Land''.&lt;ref name="chang-barker-2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl/385ec082b509e76c41256739003e636d/1d1726425f6955aec125641e0038bfd6?OpenDocument |title=Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its annex: Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land.

Another example is the Battle of Yichang in October 1941, during which the 19th Artillery Regiment helped the 13th Brigade of the [[Japanese Eleventh Army|IJA 11th Army]] by launching 1,000 yellow gas shells and 1,500 red gas shells at the Chinese forces. The area was crowded with Chinese civilians unable to evacuate. Some 3,000 Chinese soldiers were in the area and 1,600 were affected. The Japanese report stated that "the effect of gas seems considerable".&lt;ref&gt;Yuki Tanaka, ''Poison Gas, the Story Japan Would Like to Forget,'' Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, October 1988, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Yoshimi and Yuki Tanaka discovered in the Australian National Archives documents showing that [[cyanide]] gas was tested on Australian and Dutch prisoners in November 1944 on [[Kai Islands]] (Indonesia).&lt;ref&gt;''Japan tested chemical weapons on Aussie POW: new evidence'', http://search.japantimes.co.jp/member/nn20040727a9.html{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torture of prisoners of war===
[[File:LeonardGSiffleet.jpg|thumb|upright|An Australian [[POW]], Sgt. [[Leonard Siffleet]], captured in New Guinea, about to be beheaded by a Japanese officer with a [[guntō]], 1943]]
Japanese imperial forces employed widespread use of [[torture]] on prisoners, usually in an effort to gather military intelligence quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Jong|first=Louis|authorlink= Loe de Jong|others=translation J. Kilian, C. Kist and J. Rudge, introduction J. Kemperman|title=The collapse of a colonial society.

A former Japanese Army officer who served in China, Uno Shintaro, stated:

{{Quote|The major means of getting intelligence was to extract information by interrogating prisoners. Torture was an unavoidable necessity. Murdering and burying them follows naturally. You do it so you won't be found out. I believed and acted this way because I was convinced of what I was doing. We carried out our duty as instructed by our masters. We did it for the sake of our country. From our filial obligation to our ancestors. On the battlefield, we never really considered the Chinese humans. When you're winning, the losers look really miserable. We concluded that the [[Yamato people|Yamato race]] [i.e., Japanese] was superior.&lt;ref&gt;Haruko Taya Cook &amp; Theodore F. Cook, ''Japan at War'', 1993, {{ISBN|1-56584-039-9}}, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Effectiveness of torture for interrogation|effectiveness of torture]] might also have been counterproductive to Japan's war effort. After the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropping of the atomic bombs]] on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] during World War II, the Japanese military tortured a captured American [[P-51]] [[fighter pilot]] named Marcus McDilda in order to discover how many [[atomic bombs]] the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] had and what the future targets were. McDilda, who knew nothing about the atomic bomb nor the [[Manhattan Project]], "confessed" under torture that the U.S. had 100 atomic bombs and that [[Tokyo]] and [[Kyoto]] were the next targets. McDilda's false confession may have swayed the Japanese leaders' decision to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Jerome T. Hagen| title=War in the Pacific, Chapter 25 "The Lie of Marcus McDilda"| publisher= Hawaii Pacific University| year=1996| isbn=978-0-9653927-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Execution and killing of captured Allied airmen===
[[File:Doolittle Raider RL Hite blindfolded by Japanese 1942.jpg|thumb|left|A blindfolded Doolittle Raider taken captive in 1942]]
Many Allied airmen captured by the Japanese on land or at sea were executed in accordance with official Japanese policy. During the [[Battle of Midway]] in June 1942, three American airmen who were shot down and landed at sea were spotted and captured by Japanese warships. After brief interrogations, two airmen were killed, their bodies then tied to five-gallon kerosene cans filled with water and dumped overboard from destroyer ''Makigumo''; the third was killed and his body dumped overboard from ''[[Japanese destroyer Arashi|Arashi]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

On August 13, 1942, Japan passed the [[Enemy Airmen's Act]], which stated that Allied pilots who bombed non-military targets in the [[Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II|Pacific Theater]] and were captured on land or at sea by Japanese forces were subject to trial and punishment despite the absence of any international law containing provisions regarding [[aerial warfare]].&lt;ref name="ICRC"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Law of Air Warfare |journal=International Review of the Red Cross |number=323 |pages=347–63 |date=June 30, 1998 |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jpcl.htm |author=Javier Guisández Gómez |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425044944/http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jpcl.htm |archivedate=2013-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation was passed in response to the [[Doolittle Raid]], which occurred on April 18, 1942, in which American [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25]] bombers under the command of [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Jimmy Doolittle|James Doolittle]] bombed Tokyo and other Japanese cities. According to the [[Hague Convention of 1907]] (the only convention which Japan had ratified regarding the treatment of prisoners of war), any military personnel captured on land or at sea by enemy troops were to be treated as prisoners of war and not punished for simply being lawful combatants. Eight Doolittle Raiders captured upon landing in China (and unaware of the existence of the Enemy Airmen's Act) were the first Allied aircrew to be brought before a [[kangaroo court]] in Shanghai under the act, charged with alleged (but unproven) strafing of Japanese civilians during the Doolittle Raid. The eight aircrew were forbidden to give any defense and, despite the lack of legitimate evidences, were found guilty of participating in aerial military operations against Japan. Five of the eight sentences were commuted to life imprisonment; the other three airmen were taken to a cemetery outside Shanghai, where they were [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] on October 14, 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Doolittle Raid 1942: America's first strike back at Japan (Campaign) |author=Clayton Chun |date=January 31, 2006 |page=85 |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |isbn=1-84176-918-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Strategic Bombing by the United States in World War II: The Myths and the Facts |author=Stewart Halsey Ross |date=December 13, 2002 |page=59 |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |isbn=0-7864-1412-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enemy Airmen's Act contributed to the deaths of hundreds of Allied airmen throughout the Pacific War. An estimated 132 Allied airmen shot down during the [[air raids on Japan|bombing campaign against Japan]] in 1944–1945 were [[summarily executed]] after short kangaroo trials or [[drumhead court-martial|drumhead courts-martial]]. Imperial Japanese military personnel deliberately killed 33 American airmen at Fukuoka, including fifteen who were beheaded shortly after the Japanese Government's intention to surrender was announced on August 15, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Francis (1997), pp. 471–72&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=November 2013}} Mobs of civilians also killed several Allied airmen before the Japanese military arrived to take the airmen into custody.&lt;ref&gt;Tillman (2010), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Another 94 airmen died from other causes while in Japanese custody, including 52 who were killed when they were deliberately abandoned in a prison during the [[bombing of Tokyo]] on May 24–25, 1945.&lt;ref name="Takai_Sakaida_114"&gt;Takai and Sakaida (2001), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tillman (2010), pp. 171–72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cannibalism===
Many written reports and testimonies collected by the Australian War Crimes Section of the Tokyo tribunal, and investigated by prosecutor [[William Webb (judge)|William Webb]] (the future Judge-in-Chief), indicate that Japanese personnel in many parts of Asia and the Pacific committed acts of [[cannibalism]] against Allied prisoners of war. In many cases this was inspired by ever-increasing Allied attacks on Japanese supply lines, and the death and illness of Japanese personnel as a result of hunger. According to historian Yuki Tanaka: "cannibalism was often a systematic activity conducted by whole squads and under the command of officers".&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka ''Hidden Horrors'' p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; This frequently involved murder for the purpose of securing bodies. For example, an [[British Raj|Indian]] POW, ''[[Havildar]]'' Changdi Ram, testified that: "[on November 12, 1944] the Kempeitai beheaded [an Allied] pilot. I saw this from behind a tree and watched some of the Japanese cut flesh from his arms, legs, hips, buttocks and carry it off to their quarters&amp;nbsp;... They cut it [into] small pieces and fried it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Russell of Liverpool]] (Edward Russell), ''The Knights of Bushido, a short history of Japanese War Crimes'', Greenhill books, 2002, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, flesh was cut from living people: another Indian POW, ''[[Lance Naik]]'' Hatam Ali (later a citizen of [[Pakistan]]), testified in [[New Guinea]] and stated:

{{Quote|...&amp;nbsp;the Japanese started selecting prisoners and every day one prisoner was taken out and killed and eaten by the soldiers. I personally saw this happen and about 100 prisoners were eaten at this place by the Japanese. The remainder of us were taken to another spot 50 miles [80&amp;nbsp;km] away where 10 prisoners died of sickness. At this place, the Japanese again started selecting prisoners to eat. Those selected were taken to a hut where their flesh was cut from their bodies while they were alive and they were thrown into a ditch where they later died.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Russell of Liverpool]] (Edward Russell), ''The Knights of Bushido, a short history of Japanese War Crimes'', Greenhill books, 2002, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to another account by Jemadar Abdul Latif of 4/9 Jat Regiment of the Indian Army who was rescued by the Australian army at the Sepik Bay in 1945:

"At the village of Suaid, a Japanese medical officer periodically visited the Indian compound and selected each time the healthiest men. These men were taken away ostensibly for carrying out duties, but they never reappeared,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Japanese-ate-Indian-PoWs-used-them-as-live-targets-in-WWII/articleshow/40017577.cms|title=Japanese ate Indian PoWs, used them as live targets in WWII|publisher=TheTimesofIndia|accessdate=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most senior officer convicted of cannibalism was Lt Gen. [[Yoshio Tachibana]] (立花芳夫,''Tachibana Yoshio''), who with 11 other Japanese personnel was tried in August 1946 in relation to the execution of U.S. Navy airmen, and the cannibalism of at least one of them, during August 1944, on [[Chichijima incident|Chichi Jima]], in the [[Bonin Islands]]. The airmen were beheaded on Tachibana's orders. Because military and international law did not specifically deal with cannibalism, they were tried for murder and "prevention of honorable burial". Tachibana was sentenced to death, and hanged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/yamashita6.htm ''''Case No. 21 Trial Of General Tomoyuki Yamashita[,&amp;#93; United States Military Commission, Manila, (8 October-7 December 1945), and the Supreme Court Of The United States (Judgments Delivered On 4 February 1946).

===Forced labor===
{{Main|Slavery in Japan}}
[[File:POWs Burma Thai RR.jpg|thumb|Australian and Dutch prisoners of war at Tarsau in Thailand, 1943]]
The Japanese military’s use of [[forced labor]], by Asian civilians and POWs also caused many deaths. According to a joint study by historians including Zhifen Ju, Mitsuyoshi Himeta, Toru Kubo and [[Mark Peattie]], more than 10 million Chinese civilians were mobilised by the ''[[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere#The Kōa-in|Kōa-in]]'' (Japanese Asia Development Board) for forced labour.&lt;ref&gt;Zhifen Ju, ''Japan’s atrocities of conscripting and abusing north China draftees after the outbreak of the Pacific War'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100,000 civilians and POWs died in the construction of the [[Death Railway|Burma-Siam Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mansell.com/pow_resources/links.html |title=links for research, Allied POWs under the Japanese |publisher=Mansell.com |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Library of Congress estimates that in [[Java (island)|Java]] the Japanese military forced between four and ten million ''[[romusha]]'' (Japanese: “manual laborers”) to work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+id0029) Library of Congress, 1992, ‘Indonesia: World War II and the Struggle For Independence, 1942–50; The Japanese Occupation, 1942–45’] Access date: February 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; About 270 thousand of these Javanese laborers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in Southeast Asia, but only 52 thousand were repatriated to Java, meaning that there was a death rate of eighty percent.

According to historian Akira Fujiwara, Emperor [[Hirohito]] personally ratified the decision to remove the constraints of international law ([[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|The Hague Conventions]]) on the treatment of Chinese prisoners of war in the directive of 5 August 1937. This notification also advised staff officers to stop using the term “prisoners of war”.&lt;ref&gt;Fujiwara, ''Nitchū sensō ni okeru horyo gyakusatsu'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The Geneva Convention exempted POWs of [[sergeant]] rank or higher from manual labour, and stipulated that prisoners performing work should be provided with extra rations and other essentials. Japan was not a signatory to the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on the Prisoners of War]] at the time, and Japanese forces did not follow the convention, although they ratified the [[Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on the Sick And Wounded]].&lt;ref name="icrc.org"/&gt;

===Comfort women===
{{Main|Comfort women}}
The terms {{Nihongo|"comfort women"|慰安婦|ianfu}} {{Korean|'위안부'|wianbu}} or {{Nihongo|"military comfort women"|従軍慰安婦|jūgun-ianfu}} are [[euphemism]]s for women in Japanese military [[brothel]]s in occupied countries, who were often recruited by deception or abducted and forced into [[sexual slavery]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 1992, historian [[Yoshiaki Yoshimi]] published material based on his research in archives at Japan's National Institute for Defense Studies. Yoshimi claimed that there was a direct link between imperial institutions such as the ''Kōain'' and "comfort stations". When Yoshimi's findings were published in the Japanese news media on 12 January 1993, they caused a sensation and forced the government, represented by Chief Cabinet Secretary [[Koichi Kato (LDP)|Kato Koichi]], to acknowledge some of the facts that same day. On 17 January Prime Minister [[Kiichi Miyazawa]] presented formal apologies for the suffering of the victims, during a trip in South Korea. On 6 July and 4 August, the Japanese government issued two statements by which it recognised that "Comfort stations were operated in response to the request of the military of the day", "The Japanese military was, directly or indirectly, involved in the establishment and management of the comfort stations and the transfer of comfort women" and that the women were "recruited in many cases against their own will through coaxing and coercion".&lt;ref&gt;Yoshiaki Yoshimi, 2001–02, ''Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery in the Japanese Military during World War II''. Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy was re-ignited on 1 March 2007, when Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]] mentioned suggestions that a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] committee would call on the Japanese Government to "apologise for and acknowledge" the role of the Japanese Imperial military in wartime sex slavery. Abe denied that it applied to comfort stations. "There is no evidence to prove there was coercion, nothing to support it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/01/AR2007030100578.html |title=''Washington Post'', "Japan's Abe: no proof of WWII sex slaves" |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2007-03-01 |accessdate=2013-07-21 |first=Hiroko |last=Tabuchi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abe's comments provoked negative reactions overseas. For example, a ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial on March 6 said:&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', "No comfort", March 6, 2007. https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/06/opinion/06tues3.html, accessed March 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|These were not commercial brothels. Force, explicit and implicit, was used in recruiting these women. What went on in them was serial rape, not prostitution. The Japanese Army's involvement is documented in the government's own defense files. A senior Tokyo official more or less apologized for this horrific crime in 1993&amp;nbsp;... Yesterday, he grudgingly acknowledged the 1993 quasi apology, but only as part of a pre-emptive declaration that his government would reject the call, now pending in the United States Congress, for an official apology. America isn't the only country interested in seeing Japan belatedly accept full responsibility. Korea, China, and the Philippines are also infuriated by years of Japanese equivocations over the issue.}}

The same day, veteran soldier [[Yasuji Kaneko]] admitted to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that the women "cried out, but it didn't matter to us whether the women lived or died. We were the emperor's soldiers. Whether in military brothels or in the villages, we raped without reluctance."&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Post, ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bahay na Pula]] in the Philippines is an example of a military-operated brothel.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36537605&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April 2007, Yoshimi and another historian, Hirofumi Hayashi, announced the discovery, in the archives of the Tokyo Trials, of seven official documents suggesting that Imperial military forces, such as the ''[[Tokubetsu Keisatsutai|Tokkeitai]]'' (naval secret police), directly coerced women to work in frontline brothels in China, Indochina and Indonesia. These documents were initially made public at the war crimes trial. In one of these, a lieutenant is quoted as confessing having organized a brothel and having used it himself. Another source refers to ''Tokkeitai'' members having arrested women on the streets, and after enforced medical examinations, putting them in brothels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070418a5.html |title=Evidence documenting sex-slave coercion revealed |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119022533/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070418a5.html |archivedate=November 19, 2007 |date=April 18, 2007 |first=Reiji |last=Yoshida |work=The Japan Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 12, 2007, journalist Taichiro Kaijimura announced the discovery of 30 Netherland government documents submitted to the [[Tokyo tribunal]] as evidence of a forced massed prostitution incident in 1944 in [[Magelang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Files: Females forced into sexual servitude in wartime Indonesia |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2007/05/12/news/files-females-forced-into-sexual-servitude-in-wartime-indonesia/ |date=May 12, 2007 |work=The Japan Times |accessdate=December 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Dutch-Indonesian comfort woman, Jan Ruff-O'Hearn (now resident in Australia), who gave evidence to the U.S. committee, said the Japanese Government had failed to take responsibility for its crimes, that it did not want to pay compensation to victims and that it wanted to rewrite history. Ruff-O'Hearn said that she had been raped "day and night" for three months by Japanese soldiers when she was 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21327548-2,00.html |first=Todd |last=Cardy |date=March 5, 2007 |title=Japanese PM's denial upsets 'comfort woman' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015164728/http://news.com.au/story/0%2C23599%2C21327548-2%2C00.html |archivedate=October 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one Japanese woman published her testimony.

===Looting===
Many historians state that the Japanese government and individual military personnel engaged in widespread [[looting]] during the period of 1895 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth B. Lee, 1997, ''Korea and East Asia: The Story of a Phoenix'', Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sterling &amp; Peggy Seagrave, 2003, ''Gold warriors: America's secret recovery of Yamashita's gold'', London: Verso Books ({{ISBN|1-85984-542-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; The stolen property included private land, as well as many different kinds of valuable goods looted from banks, [[safe deposit box|depositories]], temples, [[church (building)|churches]], [[mosque]]s, [[museum]]s, other commercial premises and private homes.

===Perfidy===
Throughout the Pacific War, Japanese soldiers often [[perfidy|feigned injury or surrender]] in order to lure the approaching American forces before attacking them. One of the most famous examples of this was the [[Frank Goettge#Goettge Patrol|"Goettge Patrol"]] during the early days of the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] in August 1942. After the patrol saw a [[white flag]] displayed on the west bank of [[Matanikau River]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Frank Goettge]] assembled 25 men, primarily consisting of [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] personnel, to search the area. Unknown to the patrol, the white flag was actually a [[Japanese flag]] with the ''[[Hinomaru]]'' disc insignia obscured. A Japanese prisoner earlier deliberately tricked the Marines into an ambush by telling them that there were a number of Japanese west of the Matanikau River who wanted to surrender.&lt;ref name="EARNED"&gt;{{cite book |title=Earned in Blood: My Journey from Old-Breed Marine to the Most Dangerous Job in America |date=May 21, 2013 |page=80 |author=Thurman Miller |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |isbn=1-250-00499-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Goettge Patrol landed by boat west of the [[Lunga Point]] perimeter, between [[Point Cruz]] and the Matanikau River, on a [[reconnaissance]] mission to contact a group of Japanese troops that American forces believed might be willing to surrender. Soon after the patrol landed, a group of Japanese naval troops ambushed and almost completely wiped out the patrol. Goettge was among the dead. Only three Americans made it back to American lines in the Lunga Point perimeter alive. News of the killing and treachery by the Japanese outraged the American Marines:
{{quote|This was the first mass killing of the Marines on Guadalcanal. We were shocked. Shocked&amp;nbsp;... because headquarters had believed anything a Jap had to say&amp;nbsp;... The loss of this patrol and the particularly cruel way in which they had met death, hardened our hearts toward the Japanese. The idea of taking prisoners was swept from our minds. It was too dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On Valor's Side |year=1963 |page=297 |author=Thomas Gallant Grady |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Second Lieutenant D. A. Clark of the [[7th Marine Regiment (United States)|7th Marines]] told a similar story while patrolling Guadalcanal:

{{quote|I was on my first patrol here, and we were moving up a dry stream bed. We saw 3 Japs come down the river bed out of the jungle. The one in front was carrying a white flag. We thought they were surrendering. When they got up to us they dropped the white flag and then all 3 threw hand grenades. We killed 2 of these Japs, but 1 got away. Apparently they do not mind a sacrifice in order to get information.&lt;ref name="EARNED" /&gt;}}

[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], in his book, ''The Two-Ocean War: A Short History of the United States Navy in the Second World War'', wrote:

{{quote|There were innumerable incidents such as a wounded Japanese soldier at Guadalcanal seizing a [[scalpel]] and burying it in the back of a surgeon who was about to save his life by an operation; and a survivor of the [[Naval Battle of Vella Lavella|Battle of Vella Lavella]], rescued by PT-163, pulling a gun and killing a bluejacket in the act of giving a Japanese sailor a cup of coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Two-Ocean War: A Short History of the United States Navy in the Second World War |date=March 1, 2007 |page=273 |author=Samuel Eliot Morison |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] |isbn=1-59114-524-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} (A PT is a [[patrol torpedo boat]] and a bluejacket is an enlisted sailor.) 

These incidents, along with many other perfidious actions of the Japanese throughout the Pacific War, led to an American tendency to shoot the dead or wounded Japanese soldiers and those who were attempting to surrender and not take them as prisoners of war easily. Two Marines of [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] told cautionary tales. One confided: "They always told you take prisoners but we had some bad experiences on [[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]] taking prisoners, you take them and then as soon as they get behind the lines they drop grenades and you lose a few more people. You get a little bit leery of taking prisoners when they are fighting to the death and so are you." The other reported, "Very few of them came out on their own; when they did, why, usually one in the front he'd come out with his hands up and one behind him, he'd come out with a grenade."&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich-Straus-116&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x1dQwuiEU3UC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206&amp;dq=%22japanese+pows%22+american+hands&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Jy7xIG7C1S&amp;sig=J2I027gBjV9cqjD7t3h1-FiQW3o#PPA116,M1 Ulrich Straus, ''The Anguish Of Surrender: Japanese POWs of World War II'' (excerpts)] Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-295-98336-3}}, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stepping Stones to Nowhere: The Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and American Military Strategy, 1867–1945 |date=March 2003 |page=232 |author=Galen Roger Perras |publisher=[[University of British Columbia Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Myth and the Greatest Generation: A Social History of Americans in World War II |date=October 10, 2007 |page=264 |author=Kenneth Rose |publisher=[[Routledge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==War crimes trials==
[[File:Japanese War Crimes Trials. Manila - NARA - 292613.jpg|upright|thumb|General [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]] (second right) was tried in [[Manila]] between October 29 and December 7, 1945, by a U.S. [[Military justice|military commission]] relating to the [[Manila massacre]] and earlier occurrences in Singapore, and was sentenced to death. The case set a precedent regarding the responsibility of commanders for war crimes, and is known as the [[Yamashita Standard]].]]
Soon after the war, the Allied powers indicted 25 persons as [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Class-A war criminals]], and 5,700 persons were indicted as Class-B or Class-C war criminals by Allied criminal trials. Of these, 984 were initially condemned to death, 920 were actually executed, 475 received life sentences, 2,944 received some prison terms, 1,018 were acquitted, and 279 were not sentenced or not brought to trial. These numbers included 178 ethnic Taiwanese and 148 ethnic Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;Dower, John (2000). ''Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II'', p. 447&lt;/ref&gt; The Class-A charges were all tried by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], also known as "the Tokyo Trials". Other courts were formed in many different places in Asia and the Pacific.

===Tokyo Trials===
{{Main|International Military Tribunal for the Far East}}
The International Military Tribunal for the Far East was formed to try accused people in Japan itself.

High-ranking officers who were tried included [[Kōichi Kido]] and [[Sadao Araki]]. Three former (unelected) [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime ministers]]: [[Kōki Hirota]], [[Hideki Tojo]] and [[Kuniaki Koiso]] were convicted of Class-A war crimes. Many military leaders were also convicted. Two people convicted as Class-A war criminals later served as ministers in post-war Japanese governments.
* [[Mamoru Shigemitsu]] served as foreign minister both during the war and in the post-war [[Ichirō Hatoyama|Hatoyama government]].
* [[Okinori Kaya]] was finance minister during the war and later served as justice minister in the government of [[Hayato Ikeda]]. These two had no direct connection to alleged war crimes committed by Japanese forces, and foreign governments never raised the issue when they were appointed.

[[Hirohito]] and all members of the imperial family implicated in the war such as [[Prince Chichibu]], [[Prince Asaka]], [[Prince Takeda]] and [[Prince Higashikuni]] were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by MacArthur, with the help of [[Bonner Fellers]] who allowed the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment.&lt;ref&gt;Kumao Toyoda, ''Senso saiban yoroku'', 1986, p.170–172, H. Bix, ''Hirohito and the making of modern Japan'', 2000, p.583, 584&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians criticize this decision. According to John Dower, "with the full support of [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]]'s headquarters, the prosecution functioned, in effect, as a defense team for the emperor"&lt;ref&gt;Dower,''Embracing defeat'', 1999, p.326&lt;/ref&gt; and even Japanese activists who endorse the ideals of the Nuremberg and Tokyo charters, and who have labored to document and publicize the atrocities of the Showa regime "cannot defend the American decision to exonerate the emperor of war responsibility and then, in the chill of the [[Cold War]], release and soon afterwards openly embrace accused right-winged war criminals like the later prime minister [[Nobusuke Kishi]]."&lt;ref&gt;Dower, ''Hirohito'', p.562.&lt;/ref&gt; For Herbert Bix, "MacArthur's truly extraordinary measures to save Hirohito from trial as a war criminal had a lasting and profoundly distorting impact on Japanese understanding of the lost war."&lt;ref&gt;Bix, ''Hirohito'', p.585, 583&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other trials===

Naoji confessed to shooting two Australian POWs and five ethnic Chinese civilians.]]

Between 1946 and 1951, the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of China|China]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]] and the [[Philippines]] all held military tribunals to try Japanese indicted for Class B and Class C war crimes. Some 5,600 Japanese personnel were prosecuted in more than 2,200 trials outside Japan. Class B defendants were accused of having committed such crimes themselves; class C defendants, mostly senior officers, were accused of planning, ordering or failing to prevent them.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The [[judge]]s presiding came from the [[United States]], [[China]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]] and the [[Philippines]]. Additionally, the [[Chinese Communists]] also held a number of trials for Japanese personnel. More than 4,400 Japanese personnel were convicted and about 1,000 were sentenced to death.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The largest single trial was that of 93 Japanese personnel charged with the [[summary execution]] of more than 300 Allied POWs, in the [[Laha massacre]] (1942). The most prominent ethnic Korean convicted was Lieutenant General [[Hong Sa Ik]], who orchestrated the organisation of prisoner of war camps in Southeast Asia. In 2006, the [[South Korea]]n government "pardoned" 83 of the 148 convicted Korean war criminals.&lt;ref name="Breen"/&gt; One hundred-sixty Taiwanese who had served in the forces of the Empire of Japan were convicted of war crimes and 11 were executed.&lt;ref name="Harmsen, Peter 2012, p. 4"/&gt;

==Post-war events and reactions==

===The parole-for-war-criminals movement===
In 1950, after most Allied war crimes trials had ended, thousands of convicted war criminals sat in prisons across Asia and across Europe, detained in the countries where they were convicted. Some executions were still outstanding as many Allied courts agreed to reexamine their verdicts, reducing sentences in some cases and instituting a system of parole, but without relinquishing control over the fate of the imprisoned (even after Japan and Germany had regained their status as sovereign countries).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

An intense and broadly supported campaign for amnesty for all imprisoned war criminals ensued (more aggressively in Germany than in Japan at first), as attention turned away from the top wartime leaders and towards the majority of "ordinary" war criminals (Class B/C in Japan), and the issue of criminal responsibility was reframed as a humanitarian problem.

On March 7, 1950, MacArthur issued a directive that reduced the sentences by one-third for good behavior and authorized the parole of those who had received life sentences after fifteen years. Several of those who were imprisoned were released earlier on parole due to ill-health.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The Japanese popular reaction to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal found expression in demands for the mitigation of the sentences of war criminals and agitation for parole. Shortly after the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect in April 1952, a movement demanding the release of B- and C-class war criminals began, emphasizing the "unfairness of the war crimes tribunals" and the "misery and hardship of the families of war criminals". The movement quickly garnered the support of more than ten million Japanese. In the face of this surge of public opinion, the government commented that "public sentiment in our country is that the war criminals are not criminals. Rather, they gather great sympathy as victims of the war, and the number of people concerned about the war crimes tribunal system itself is steadily increasing."{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The parole-for-war-criminals movement was driven by two groups: those from outside who had "a sense of pity" for the prisoners; and the war criminals themselves who called for their own release as part of an anti-war peace movement. The movement that arose out of "a sense of pity" demanded "just set them free (''tonikaku shakuho o'') regardless of how it is done".

On September 4, 1952, President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] issued Executive Order 10393, establishing a Clemency and Parole Board for War Criminals to advise the President with respect to recommendations by the Government of Japan for clemency, reduction of sentence, or parole, with respect to sentences imposed on Japanese war criminals by military tribunals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=78495 |title=Harry S. Truman – Executive Order 10393 – Establishment of the Clemency and Parole Board for War Criminals |accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 1954, Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] rejected a proposed amnesty for the imprisoned war criminals but instead agreed to "change the ground rules" by reducing the period required for eligibility for parole from 15 years to 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Law and War |first=Peter H. |last=Maguire |page=255 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=87H1R-OqlZ4C&amp;pg=PA255&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;dq=parole+war+criminals |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-12051-7 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1958, all Japanese war criminals, including A-, B- and C-class were released from prison and politically rehabilitated. Hashimoto Kingorō, Hata Shunroku, Minami Jirō, and Oka Takazumi were all released on parole in 1954. Araki Sadao, Hiranuma Kiichirō, Hoshino Naoki, Kaya Okinori, Kido Kōichi, Ōshima Hiroshi, Shimada Shigetarō, and Suzuki Teiichi were released on parole in 1955. Satō Kenryō, whom many, including Judge [[Bert Röling|B.V.A. Röling]] regarded as one of the convicted war criminals least deserving of imprisonment, was not granted parole until March 1956, the last of the Class A Japanese war criminals to be released. On April 7, 1957, the Japanese government announced that, with the concurrence of a majority of the powers represented on the tribunal, the last ten major Japanese war criminals who had previously been paroled were granted clemency and were to be regarded henceforth as unconditionally free from the terms of their parole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Official apologies===
{{Further|List of war apology statements issued by Japan}}
{{Synthesis|section|date=October 2008}}
The Japanese government considers that the legal and moral positions in regard to war crimes are separate. Therefore, while maintaining that Japan violated no international law or treaties, Japanese governments have officially recognised the suffering which the Japanese military caused, and numerous apologies have been issued by the Japanese government. For example, Prime Minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]], in August 1995, [[Murayama Statement|stated]] that Japan "through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations", and he expressed his "feelings of deep remorse" and stated his "heartfelt apology". Also, on September 29, 1972, Japanese Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] stated: "[t]he Japanese side is keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war, and deeply reproaches itself."&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (quoted on the Taiwan Documents Project), ''Joint Communiqué of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China'', [http://www.taiwandocuments.org/japan01.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The official apologies are widely viewed as inadequate or only a symbolic exchange by many of the survivors of such crimes or the families of dead victims. On October 2006, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed an apology for the damage caused by its colonial rule and aggression, more than 80 Japanese lawmakers from his ruling party LDP paid visits to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]]. Many people aggrieved by Japanese war crimes also maintain that no apology has been issued for particular acts or that the Japanese government has merely expressed "regret" or "remorse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec98/china_12-1.html |title=PBS. Online NewsHour: I'm Sorry – December 1, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March 2007, the issue was raised again by Japanese prime minister [[Shinzō Abe]], in which he denied that the military had forced women into sexual slavery during World War II. He stated, "The fact is, there is no evidence to prove there was coercion." Before he spoke, a group of Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers also sought to revise the [[Kono Statement]].&lt;ref name="Tabuchi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Associated Press"/&gt; This provoked negative reaction from Asian and Western countries.

On 31 October 2008, the [[chief of staff]] of [[Japan]]'s [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force|Air Self-Defense Force]] [[Toshio Tamogami]] was dismissed with a 60 million yen allowance&lt;ref name=Tamogami&gt;{{cite web|title=Tamogami ups Nationalist rhetoric |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081112a1.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216083653/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081112a1.html |archivedate=2008-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to an essay he published, arguing that Japan was not an aggressor during [[World War II]], that the war brought prosperity to China, Taiwan and Korea, that the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s conduct was not violent and that the [[Greater East Asia War]] is viewed in a positive way by many Asian countries and criticizing the [[Tokyo tribunal|war crimes trials]] which followed the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.co.jp/book_report/images/2008jyusyou_saiyuusyu_english.pdf |title=Text of original essay |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513223146/http://www.apa.co.jp/book_report/images/2008jyusyou_saiyuusyu_english.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 November, Tamogami added before the Diet that the personal apology made in 1995 by former prime minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]] was "a tool to suppress free speech".&lt;ref name=Tamogami /&gt;

Some in Japan have asserted that what is being demanded is that the Japanese Prime Minister or the Emperor perform ''[[dogeza]]'', in which an individual kneels and bows his head to the ground—a high form of apology in [[East Asia]]n societies that Japan appears unwilling to do.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Laurie A., "Japan's Press Clubs as Information Cartels," ''Japan Policy Research Institute'', (April, 1996), [http://www.jpri.org/publications/workingpapers/wp18.html]. Discusses impending visit in 1990 to Japan by Korean president Roh Tae Woo in which Japanese cabinet secretary Ozawa Ichiro reportedly said, "it is because we have reflected on the past that we cooperate with Korea economically. Is it really necessary to grovel on our hands and knees and prostrate ourselves any more than we already have?".

On 13 September 2010, Japanese Foreign Minister [[Katsuya Okada]] met in Tokyo with six former American POWs of the Japanese and apologized for their treatment during World War II. Okada said: "You have all been through hardships during World War II, being taken prisoner by the Japanese military, and suffered extremely inhumane treatment. On behalf of the Japanese government and as the foreign minister, I would like to offer you my heartfelt apology."&lt;ref&gt;Ito, Masami, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100914a3.html Okada apologizes for U.S. POWs' treatment]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 14 September 2010, p. 2. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensation===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}
There is a widespread perception that the Japanese government has not accepted the legal responsibility for compensation and, as a direct consequence of this denial, it has failed to compensate the individual victims of Japanese atrocities. In particular, a number of prominent [[human rights]] and [[women's rights]] organisations insist that Japan still has a moral or legal responsibility to compensate individual victims, especially the [[sex slave]]s conscripted by the Japanese military in occupied countries and known as ''"[[comfort women]]"''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The Japanese government officially accepted the requirement for monetary compensation to victims of war crimes, as specified by the [[Potsdam Declaration]]. The details of this compensation have been left to bilateral treaties with individual countries, except [[North Korea]], because Japan recognises [[South Korea]] as the sole legitimate government of the [[Korea|Korean Peninsula]]. In the Asian countries involved, claims to compensation were either abandoned by their respective countries, or were paid out by Japan under the specific understanding that it was to be used for individual compensation. In some cases such as with [[South Korea]], the compensation was not paid out to victims by their governments, instead being used for civic projects and other works. Due to this, large numbers of individual victims in Asia received no compensation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Therefore, the Japanese government's position is that the proper avenues for further claims are the governments of the respective claimants. As a result, every individual compensation claim brought to Japanese court has failed. Such was the case in regard to a British POW who was unsuccessful in an attempt to sue the Japanese government for additional money for compensation. As a result, the British Government later paid additional compensation to all British POWs. There were complaints in Japan that the international media simply stated that the former POW was demanding compensation and failed to clarify that he was seeking ''further'' compensation, in addition to that paid previously by the Japanese government.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

A small number of claims have also been brought in US courts, though these have also been rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Byoungwook |last=Park |url=http://www.auilr.org/pdf/17/17-2-4.pdf |title=Comfort Women During WWII: Are U.S. Courts A Final Resort For Justice? |publisher=www.auilr.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809073220/http://www.auilr.org/pdf/17/17-2-4.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the treaty negotiation with South Korea, the Japanese government proposed that it pay monetary compensation to individual Korean victims, in line with the payments to Western POWs. The Korean government instead insisted that Japan pay money collectively to the Korean government, and that is what occurred. The South Korean government then used the funds for economic development. The content of the negotiations was not released by the Korean government until 2004, although it was public knowledge in Japan. Due to the release of the information by the Korean government, a number of claimants have stepped forward and are attempting to sue the government for individual compensation of victims.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

There are those that insist that because the governments of [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Taiwan]] abandoned their claims for monetary compensation, then the moral or legal responsibility for compensation belongs with these governments. Such critics also point out that even though these governments abandoned their claims, they signed treaties that recognised the transfer of Japanese colonial assets to the respective governments. Therefore, to claim that these governments received no compensation from Japan is incorrect, and they could have compensated individual victims from the proceeds of such transfers. Others dispute that Japanese colonial assets in large proportion were built or stolen with extortion or force in occupied countries, as was clearly the case with artworks collected (or stolen) by Nazis during World War II throughout Europe.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The Japanese government, while admitting no legal responsibility for the so-called "comfort women", set up the [[Asian Women's Fund]] in 1995, which gives money to people who claim to have been forced into prostitution during the war. Though the organisation was established by the government, legally, it has been created such that it is an independent charity. The activities of the fund have been controversial in Japan, as well as with international organisations supporting the women concerned.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
Some argue that such a fund is part of an ongoing refusal by the Japanese government to face up to its responsibilities, while others say that the Japanese government has long since finalised its responsibility to individual victims and is merely correcting the failures of the victims' own governments. [[California]] [[Congressman]] [[Mike Honda]], speaking before U.S. House of Representatives on behalf of the women, said that "without a sincere and unequivocal apology from the government of Japan, the majority of surviving Comfort Women refused to accept these funds. In fact, as you will hear today, many Comfort Women returned the Prime Minister's letter of apology accompanying the monetary compensation, saying they felt the apology was artificial and disingenuous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://honda.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=205 |author=Mike Honda |title=Honda Testifies in Support of Comfort Women |publisher=U.S. House of Representative |date=February 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419123818/http://www.honda.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=205 |archivedate=April 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intermediate compensation====
The term "intermediate compensation" (or intermediary compensation) was applied to the removal and reallocation of Japanese industrial (particularly military-industrial) assets to Allied countries. It was conducted under the supervision of [[Occupied Japan|Allied occupation forces]]. This reallocation was referred to as "intermediate" because it did not amount to a final settlement by means of bilateral treaties, which settled all existing issues of compensation. By 1950, the assets reallocated amounted to 43,918 items of machinery, valued at [[Yen|¥]]165,158,839 (in 1950 prices). The proportions in which the assets were distributed were: China, 54.1%; the Netherlands, 11.5%; the Philippines 19%, and; the United Kingdom, 15.4%.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Japanese overseas assets refers to all assets owned by the Japanese government, firms, organization and private citizens, in colonised or occupied countries. In accordance with Clause 14 of the San Francisco Treaty, Allied forces confiscated all Japanese overseas assets, except those in China, which were dealt with under Clause 21. It is considered that Korea was also entitled to the rights provided by Clause 21.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

=====Compensation to Allied POWs=====
Clause 16 of the San Francisco Treaty stated that Japan would transfer its assets and those of its citizens in countries which were at war with any of the Allied Powers or which were neutral, or equivalents, to the [[Red Cross]], which would sell them and distribute the funds to former prisoners of war and their families. Accordingly, the Japanese government and private citizens paid out £4,500,000 to the Red Cross.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

According to historian Linda Goetz Holmes, many funds used by the government of Japan were not Japanese funds but relief funds contributed by the governments of the US, the UK and the Netherlands and sequestred in the Yokohama Specie Bank during the final year of the war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120604102422/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/print/rc20090222a4.html Linda Goetz Holmes, ''Unjust Enrichment: How Japan's Companies Built Postwar Fortunes Using American POW's'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Clause 14 of the treaty stated that Japan would enter into negotiations with Allied powers whose territories were occupied by Japan and suffered damage by Japanese forces, with a view to Japan compensating those countries for the damage.

Accordingly, the Philippines and [[South Vietnam]] received compensation in 1956 and 1959 respectively. [[Burma]] and [[Indonesia]] were not original signatories, but they later signed bilateral treaties in accordance with clause 14 of the San Francisco Treaty.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The last payment was made to the Philippines on 22 July 1976.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Debate in Japan===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}

====From a fringe topic to an open debate====
Until the 1970s, Japanese war crimes were considered a fringe topic in the media. In the Japanese media, the opinions of the political centre and left tend to dominate the [[editorial]]s of newspapers, while the right tend to dominate magazines. Debates regarding war crimes were confined largely to the editorials of [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] magazines where calls for the overthrow of "[[American Empire (term)|Imperialist America]]" and revived veneration of the Emperor coexisted with pornography. In 1972, to commemorate the normalisation of relationship with China, ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', a major [[Liberalism|liberal]] newspaper, ran a series on Japanese war crimes in China including the [[Nanking Massacre]]. This opened the floodgates to debates which have continued ever since. The 1990s are generally considered to be the period in which such issues become truly mainstream, and incidents such as the Nanking Massacre, [[Yasukuni Shrine]], comfort women, [[Japanese history textbook controversies|the accuracy of school history textbooks]], and the validity of the Tokyo Trials were debated, even on television.

As the consensus of Japanese jurists is that Japanese forces did not technically commit violations of international law, many [[uyoku dantai|right wing elements]] in Japan have taken this to mean that war crimes trials were examples of [[victor's justice]]. They see those convicted of war crimes as {{Nihongo|"Martyrs of Shōwa"|昭和殉難者|Shōwa Junnansha}}, Shōwa being the name given to the rule of Hirohito. This interpretation is vigorously contested by Japanese peace groups and the political left. In the past, these groups have tended to argue that the trials hold some validity, either under the Geneva Convention (even though Japan hadn't signed it), or under an undefined concept of international law or consensus. Alternatively, they have argued that, although the trials may not have been technically ''valid'', they were still ''just'', somewhat in line with popular opinion in the West and in the rest of Asia.

[[File:Revisionists Yasukuni 1.jpg|thumb|Member of the right-wing revisionist group "[[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]]" putting up a banner reading "[Give] the children correct history textbooks" in front of the [[Yasukuni Jinja]]]]

By the early 21st century, the revived interest in Japan's imperial past had brought new interpretations from a group which has been labelled both "new right" and "new left". This group points out that many acts committed by Japanese forces, including the Nanjing Incident, were violations of the Japanese military code. It is suggested that had war crimes tribunals been conducted by the post-war Japanese government, in strict accordance with Japanese military law, many of those who were accused would still have been convicted and executed. Therefore, the moral and legal failures in question were the fault of the Japanese military and the government, for not executing their constitutionally defined duty.

The new right/new left also takes the view that the Allies committed no war crimes against Japan, because Japan was not a signatory to the Geneva Convention, and as a victors, the Allies had every right to demand some form of retribution, to which Japan consented in various treaties.

Under the same logic, the new right/new left considers the killing of Chinese who were suspected of guerrilla activity to be perfectly legal and valid, including some of those killed at Nanjing, for example. They also take the view that many Chinese civilian casualties resulted from the [[scorched earth]] tactics of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese nationalists]]. Though such tactics are arguably legal, the new right/new left takes the position that some of the civilian deaths caused by these scorched earth tactics are wrongly attributed to the Japanese military.

Similarly, they take the position that those who have attempted to sue the Japanese government for compensation have no legal or moral case.

The new right and new left also take a less sympathetic view of Korean claims of victimhood, because prior to annexation by Japan, Korea was a [[tributary]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] and, according to them, the Japanese colonisation, though undoubtedly harsh, was "better" than the previous rule in terms of human rights and economic development.

They also argue that, the ''[[Kantōgun]]'' (also known as the Kwantung Army) was at least partly culpable. Although the ''Kantōgun'' was nominally subordinate to the Japanese high command at the time, its leadership demonstrated significant self-determination, as shown by its involvement in the plot to assassinate [[Zhang Zuolin]] in 1928, and the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, which led to the foundation of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932. Moreover, at that time, it was the official policy of the Japanese high command to confine the conflict to Manchuria. But in defiance of the high command, the ''Kantōgun'' invaded [[China proper]], under the pretext of the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]]. The Japanese government not only failed to court martial the officers responsible for these incidents, but it also accepted the war against China, and many of those who were involved were even promoted. (Some of the officers involved in the [[Nanking Massacre]] were also promoted.)

Whether or not Hirohito himself bears any responsibility for such failures is a sticking point between the new right and new left. Officially, the imperial constitution, adopted under [[Emperor Meiji]], gave full powers to the Emperor. Article 4 prescribed that "The Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty, and exercises them, according to the provisions of the present Constitution" and article 11 prescribed that "The Emperor has the supreme command of the Army and the Navy".

For historian Akira Fujiwara, the thesis that the emperor as an organ of responsibility could not reverse cabinet decisions is a myth (shinwa) fabricated after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Fujiwara, ''Shôwa tennô no jû-go nen sensô'', Aoki Shoten, 1991, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that Hirohito deliberately styled his rule in the manner of the British [[constitutional monarchy]], and he always accepted the decisions and consensus reached by the high command. According to this position, the moral and political failure rests primarily with the Japanese High Command and the Cabinet, most of whom were later convicted at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal as class-A war criminals, apart all members of the imperial family such as [[Prince Chichibu]], Prince [[Yasuhiko Asaka]], [[Prince Higashikuni]], Prince [[Hiroyasu Fushimi]] and [[Prince Takeda]].

====Nippon Kaigi, the main revisionist lobby====
The denial of Japanese war crimes is one of the key missions of the openly [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] lobby [[Nippon Kaigi]] (Japan Conference), a nationalistic nonparty organisation that was established in 1997 and also advocates patriotic education, the revision of the constitution, and official visits to Yasukuni Shrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Penney |first=Matthew |date=January 28, 2013 |title=The Abe Cabinet – An Ideological Breakdown |journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus |url=http://apjjf.org/-Matthew-Penney/4747/article.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian G.

The chairman, Toru Miyoshi, is a former Chief Justice of the [[Supreme Court of Japan]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Later investigations===
As with investigations of Nazi war criminals, official investigations and inquiries are still ongoing. During the 1990s, the [[South Korea]]n government started investigating some people who had allegedly become wealthy while collaborating with the Japanese military.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=23332&amp;categoryCode=117 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004181952/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=23332&amp;categoryCode=117 |date=October 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="koreatimes.co.kr"&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=2202&amp;categoryCode=117 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004182014/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=2202&amp;categoryCode=117 |date=October 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Korea, it is also alleged that, during the political climate of the [[Cold War]], many such people or their associates or relatives were able to acquire influence with the wealth they had acquired collaborating with the Japanese and assisted in the covering-up, or non-investigation, of war crimes in order not to incriminate themselves. With the wealth they had amassed during the years of collaboration, they were able to further benefit their families by obtaining higher education for their relatives.&lt;ref name="koreatimes.co.kr"/&gt;

Non-government bodies and persons have also undertaken their own investigations. For example, in 2005, a South Korean freelance journalist, Jung Soo-woong, located in Japan some descendants of people involved in the 1895 [[assassination]] of [[Empress Myeongseong of Korea|Empress Myeongseong]] (Queen Min). The assassination was conducted by the [[Genyōsha]], perhaps under the auspices of the Japanese government, because of the Empress's involvement in attempts to reduce Japanese influence in Korea. Jung recorded the apologies of the persons.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

As these investigations continue more evidence is discovered each day. It has been claimed that the Japanese government intentionally destroyed the reports on Korean comfort women.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|last=Horsley |first=William |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4749467.stm |title=World &amp;#124; Asia-Pacific &amp;#124; Korean WWII sex slaves fight on |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-08-09 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theseoultimes.com/ST/?url=/ST/db/read.php?idx=1846 |title=''Ex-sex slave narrates: "Japan Boiled Comfort Woman to Make Soup". Japanese Army Ran "Comfort Woman System"'' |work=The Seoul Times|accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have cited Japanese inventory logs and employee sheets on the battlefield as evidence for this claim. For example, one of the names on the list was of a comfort woman who stated she was forced to be a prostitute by the Japanese. She was classified as a nurse along with at least a dozen other verified comfort women who were not nurses or secretaries. Currently, the South Korean government is looking into the hundreds of other names on these lists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200501/200501110028.html Digital Chosunilbo (English Edition) : Daily News in English About Korea.

Today, further allegations of cover-ups by Japan and other countries continue to emerge as more investigations are conducted. For example, in 2011 it was alleged in an article published in the ''Japan Times'' newspaper that the British government were involved in the covering-up of Japanese war crimes as they wanted to end the warcrime trials early in order to re-establish good relations with Japan post-war to prevent the spread of communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coskrey |first=Jason |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081017a3.html |title=Britain covered up Japan massacre of POWs |work=The Japan Times |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606151927/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081017a3.html |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, scholars and public intellectuals continue to criticize Japan for what they view as a refusal to acknowledge and apologize fully for Japanese war crimes. [[Amitai Etzioni]] of the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies, who was a child in Germany when the Nazis rose to power, has stated in response to Prime Minister Abe's visits to Yasukuni Shrine, "Unlike Japan, [[Vergangenheitsbewältigung|[Germany] faced their past, came to terms with it and learned from it]]. Japan should do the same."&lt;ref&gt;Chen Weihua, "Japan should learn from Germany: US expert," China Daily, January 29, 2014, [http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/2014-01/29/content_17263869.htm].
Etzioni, Amitai, "Japan Should Follow—Germany," The Diplomat, February 6, 2014, [http://thediplomat.com/2014/02/japan-should-follow-germany/].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japanese Imperial Family's concerns====
Potentially in contrast to Prime Minister Abe's example of his Yasukuni Shrine visits, by February 2015 some concern within the [[Imperial House of Japan]] — which normally does not issue such statements — over the issue was voiced by [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Crown Prince Naruhito]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/japanese-experiments-u-s-pows-exhibit-shows-brutal-history-n338231 |title=Japan's Experiments on U.S. POWs: Exhibit Highlights Horrific History |last=Yamamoto |first=Arata |date=April 9, 2015 |website=nbcnews.com |publisher=NBC News |access-date=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; expected to succeed [[Akihito|his father]] [[Japanese imperial transition, 2019|in late April 2019]]. Naruhito stated on his 55th birthday (February 23, 2015) that it was "important to look back on the past humbly and correctly", in reference to Japan's role in World War II-era war crimes, and that he was concerned about the ongoing need to, in his own words: "correctly pass down tragic experiences and the history behind Japan to the generations who have no direct knowledge of the war, at the time memories of the war are about to fade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/world-war-ii-should-not-be-forgotten-japans-prince-naruhito-n311561 |title=World War II Should Not Be Forgotten, Japan's Prince Naruhito Says |last=Itasaka |first=Kiko |date=February 24, 2015 |website=nbcnews.com |publisher=NBC News |access-date=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two visits to the Yasukuni Shrine in the second half of 2016 by Japan's former foreign minister, [[Masahiro Imamura]], was again followed by controversy that still shows potential for concern over how Japan's World War II history may be remembered by its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/08/11/national/politics-diplomacy/reconstruction-minister-visits-war-linked-yasukuni-shrine Reconstruction minister visits war-linked Yasukuni Shrine]" (Japan Times - August 11, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/2057841/japan-defence-minister-visits-yasukuni-war-shrine-one-day-after "Japan defence minister visits Yasukuni war shrine, one day after visiting Pearl Harbour with Abe"], [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] via ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', 29 December 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1070">'''"kaivalagi"''' is a [[Fijian language|Fijian]] word meaning someone "from the land of the foreigners." Its antonym, [[kaiviti]], means "someone from [[Fiji]]."  It is often used instead of the word "[[vulagi]]", meaning foreigner or stranger. In practice, "kaivalagi" usually means "white person" or "European" (which in Fiji English also includes white people from America and Australasia), whilst "vulagi" can include all non-Fijians.

Similar words for "white man" exist in most [[Melanesia]]n, [[Polynesia]]n and [[Micronesia]]n languages: For example, in the [[Cook Islands]] - "Papa'a"; New Zealand - "[[Pakeha]]"; [[New Caledonia]]n slang - "poken" (although this is used only for English speaking foreigners); [[Hawaii]] - "Haole"; [[Samoa]] - "Palagi"; [[Tonga]] - "Papalagi"; [[Marshall Islands]] - "ri-Likin" [http://www.rmiembassyus.org/Marshallese%20Phrasebook/foreigner.wav] etc.

'''Khmer ceramics''' refers to [[ceramic art]] and [[pottery]] designed or produced as a form of [[Khmer art]]. The tradition of Cambodian ceramics dates back to the third millennium BCE. Pottery and ceramics were an essential part of the trade between Cambodia and its neighbours.

In Europe the [[Musée Guimet]] in Paris has a number of historic Cambodian ceramic pieces. 

The [[Khmer Ceramics &amp; Fine Arts Centre]] in Siem Reap was established in 2006 to re-establish ancient pottery techniques and production. The [[National Museum of Cambodia]] houses an important collection.

'''Kotava''' is a proposed [[international auxiliary language]] (IAL) that focuses especially on the principle of cultural neutrality.  The name means "the language of one and all," and the Kotava community has adopted the slogan "a project humanistic and universal, utopian and realistic". The language is mainly known in French-speaking countries and most material to learn it is in French.

== History ==
Kotava was invented by Staren Fetcey, who began the project in 1975, on the basis of her study of previous IAL projects.  The language was first made available to the public in 1978, and two major revisions were made in 1988 and 1993. Since then, the language has stabilized, with a lexicon of more than 17,000 basic roots. In 2005, a committee of seven members was established with the responsibility of guiding the future evolution of the language.

The overall goal was to create a potential IAL that was not based on a particular cultural substrate. To do this, a number of subgoals were established:

* A simple and limited [[phonetics|phonetic]] system that can be pronounced easily by the majority of people.
* A simple and totally regular grammar that reflects the grammars of the majority of languages in the world.
* A clear [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], with each [[morpheme]] having a well-defined and exclusive function.
* An ''[[Constructed language#A priori and a posterior languages|a priori]]'' lexicon that does not favor any language. (This appears to be of supreme importance to its creator.){{citation needed|date=August 2018}}
* A collection of basic [[root (linguistics)|root]]s that are clearly defined and [[homonym]]-free.
* Mechanisms for productive derivation and composition to allow for maximum expressiveness, from the most general to the most subtle and precise.

== Linguistic properties ==
=== Classification ===
As an ''a priori'' [[constructed language]], Kotava is not related to any other  language, natural or constructed. The word order is very free, but current practice leans toward ''[[object–subject–verb]]'' (OSV).

=== Writing system ===
Kotava is written with the [[Latin alphabet]], but doesn't use the letter Q.  It uses no [[diacritic]]s except for an acute accent, only used to mark the first person of verbs, which is accented on the final vowel.

=== Phonology ===
In Kotava, words are pronounced exactly as written, without exceptions.

Most [[consonants]] are pronounced as in English, but C is pronounced as English sh, J as in French (or the s in English pleasure), and the X as in Scottish loch, and the R is rolled.

The consonants (in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] form) are:

| colspan="2" |{{IPA|l}}
| colspan="2" |  
| colspan="2" |{{IPA|j}}
| colspan="2" |  
|}

The [[vowels]] are pronounced as in Spanish or Kiswahili or Tahitian, with no differences of length and no nasalization.

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;"
!
! | [[Front vowel|Front]]
! | [[Back vowel|Back]]

| {{IPA|e}}
| {{IPA|o}}
|-
! style="text-align: right;" | [[Open vowel|Open]]
| colspan=2 | {{IPA|a}}
|}

There are five [[diphthongs]]: ay, ey, iy (very rare), oy, uy (very rare).

The stress rule in Kotava is regular for all polysyllabic words : on the ultimate syllable if the word has a final consonant ; in the penultimate (second from last) if the word has a final vowel, except for the first person of conjugated verbs, which is stressed on the ultimate syllable (marked with an acute accent).

=== Morphology ===
Kotava has strict morphological rules, outlined in a table which prescribes order and interaction. All parts of speech are marked, so there is no ambiguity.  [[Nouns]] and [[pronouns]] are invariable and there is no system of declensions.  These are no affixes of gender or plurality, both of which can be indicated with particles or other words, if necessary. One unusual feature of Kotava is a "euphonic" principle which matches endings of adjectives and other modifiers with their nouns.

=== Grammar ===
The verbal system is the pivot of Kotava. [[Verbs]] are conjugated into three [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] (present, past, and future) and four [[Grammatical mood|moods]] (realis, [[imperative mood|imperative]], [[conditional mood|conditional]], relative). In addition, there are mechanisms for voices, aspects, [[Grammatical modality|modalities]] and other nuances, permitting a great deal of subtlety in expression. There are seven persons for verbs, including an inclusive and exclusive first person plural.

In Kotava, the word order tends to be object–subject–verb, and all objects and other complements must be introduced by prepositions.  There are also innovations involving conjunctions and prepositions (i.e. its system of locative prepositions).

== Literature ==
The literature has an important place among the Kotava-speaking community. There are hundreds of translations of novels (Tolstoy,&lt;ref name="Tolstoy"&gt;Anna Karenina, Lev Tolstoy [http://www.europalingua.eu/wikikrenteem/Anna_Karenina_Pak01_Luz01 Anna Karenina]&lt;/ref&gt; Zola,&lt;ref name="Zola"&gt;Germinal, Emile Zola [http://www.europalingua.eu/wikikrenteem/Germinal_Luz01 Germinal]&lt;/ref&gt; Maupassant,&lt;ref name="Maupassant"&gt;Dumpling, Guy de Maupassant [http://fr.scribd.com/doc/138375673/Cwekfixuya-Guy-de-Maupassant-Boule-de-Suif Cwekfixuya]&lt;/ref&gt; Mirbeau,&lt;ref name="Mirbeau"&gt;The Diary of a Chambermaid, Octave Mirbeau [http://www.mirbeau.org/cahiers20.htm Pone ke mawakwikya, Cahiers Octave Mirbeau n°20, march 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Camus,&lt;ref name="Camus"&gt;Exile and the kingdom, Albert Camus [http://www.europalingua.eu/wikikrenteem/Emudenik Divblira is Gazaxo ; Emudenik]&lt;/ref&gt; Molière,&lt;ref name="Moliere"&gt;Scapin's Deceits, Molière [http://www.europalingua.eu/wikikrenteem/NhagaceemScapin_Nakileem01_Nakila01 Nhagaceem ke Scapin]&lt;/ref&gt; Sholokhov,&lt;ref name="Sholokhov"&gt;And Quiet Flows the Don, Mikhail Sholokhov [http://www.europalingua.eu/wikikrenteem/Don_Diliodaf_Bost_Luz01 Don diliodaf bost]&lt;/ref&gt; Saint-Exupéry,&lt;ref name="SaintExupery"&gt;The Little Prince, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry [http://fr.scribd.com/doc/3897434/The-Little-Prince-in-Kotava Sersikam]&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo,&lt;ref name="Hugo"&gt;Claude Gueux, Victor Hugo [http://fr.scribd.com/doc/145655210/Claude-Gueux-Claude-Jastrik-Victor-Hugo-Claude-Gueux Claude Gueux (Claude Jastrik)]&lt;/ref&gt; etc.), tales (La Fontaine, Perrault, Grimm, Andersen, legends of the world&lt;ref name="100Legends"&gt;100 legends of the World, in Kotava, 2007.

:''Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to marry a princess; but she would have to be a real princess. He travelled all over the world to find one, but nowhere could he get what he wanted. There were princesses enough, but it was difficult to find out whether they were real ones. There was always something about them that was not as it should be. So he came home again and was sad, for he would have liked very much to have a real princess.''

:''It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate. But, good gracious! what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look. The water ran down from her hair and clothes; it ran down into the toes of her shoes and out again at the heels. And yet she said that she was a real princess.''

:''"Well, we'll soon find that out," thought the old queen. But she said nothing, went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses.''

{{lang|avk|Gazdon, sin ve eruyud inde in al kenibeyer.}}

:''On this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning she was asked how she had slept.''

{{lang|avk|— Rotapon, in ve dulzeyer, mielon  itafenkumuyur. Lorik va coba koe bata ilava gruper. Vamoe koncoba olgafa maneke moe varafo alto va jontika faltagla isu ebeltagla dí senheyé ! Eaftafa !}}

:''"Oh, very badly!" said she. "I have scarcely closed my eyes all night. Heaven only knows what was in the bed, but I was lying on something hard, so that I am black and blue all over my body. It's horrible!"''

{{lang|avk|Bam sin ve kagrupeyed da in tiyir sersanikya larde, reme tol-sanoya cipia isu eider bruxafa krinca va urt al peztaleyer. Mana gustafa alma anton rotiyir tela ke garifa sersikya.}}

:''Now they knew that she was a real princess because she had felt the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down beds. Nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that.''

'''Language processing''' refers to the way humans use words to communicate ideas and feelings, and how such communications are processed and understood. Language processing is considered to be a uniquely human ability that is not produced with the same grammatical understanding or systematicity in even human's closest primate relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seidenberg|first=Mark S.|last2=Petitto|first2=Laura A. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1987|title=Communication, symbolic communication, and language: Comment on Savage-Rumbaugh, McDonald, Sevcik, Hopkins, and Rupert (1986) |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General | volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=279–287 |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.116.3.279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, due to improvements in intra-cortical electrophysiological recordings of  monkey and human brains, as well non-invasive techniques such as fMRI, PET, MEG and EEG, a dual auditory pathway&lt;ref name="Hickok_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hickok G, Poeppel D | title = The cortical organization of speech processing | journal = Nature Reviews.

In accordance with this model, there are two pathways that connect the auditory cortex to the frontal lobe, each pathway accounting for different linguistic roles. The '''auditory ventral stream''' pathway is responsible for sound recognition, and is accordingly known as the auditory 'what' pathway. The '''auditory dorsal stream''' in both humans and non-human primates is responsible for sound localization, and is accordingly known as the auditory 'where' pathway. In humans, this pathway (especially in the left hemisphere) is also responsible for speech production, speech repetition, lip-reading, and phonological working memory and long-term memory. In accordance with the 'from where to what' model of language evolution.&lt;ref name="Poliva_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Poliva O | title = From where to what: a neuroanatomically based evolutionary model of the emergence of speech in humans | journal = F1000Research | volume = 4 | pages = 67 | date = 2017-09-20 | pmid = 28928931 | pmc = 5600004 | doi = 10.12688/f1000research.6175.3 | department = review }} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poliva_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Poliva O | title = From Mimicry to Language: A Neuroanatomically Based Evolutionary Model of the Emergence of Vocal Language | journal = Frontiers in Neuroscience | volume = 10 | pages = 307 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27445676 | pmc = 4928493 | doi = 10.3389/fnins.2016.00307 | department = review }} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].&lt;/ref&gt; the reason the ADS is characterized with such a broad range of functions is that each indicates a different stage in language evolution.

The division of the two streams first occurs in the [[auditory nerve]] where the anterior branch enters the anterior [[cochlear nucleus]] in the brainstem which gives rise to the auditory ventral stream.

Throughout the 20th century, our knowledge of language processing in the brain was dominated by the Wernicke-Lichtheim-Geschwind model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lichteim  L|date=1885-01-01 |title=On Aphasia |journal=Brain |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=433–484 |doi=10.1093/brain/7.4.433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geschwind_1965" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Der aphasische Symptomenkomplex |last=Wernicke |first=Carl |name-list-format=vanc |date=1974 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |isbn=978-3-540-06905-8 |pages=1–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wernicke-Lichtheim-Geschwind model is primarily based on research conducted on brain-damaged individuals who were reported to possess a variety of language related disorders. In accordance with this model, words are perceived via a specialized word reception center ([[Wernicke's area|Wernicke’s area]]) that is located in the left [[temporoparietal junction]]. This region then projects to a word production center ([[Broca’s area]]) that is located in the left [[inferior frontal gyrus]]. Because almost all language input was thought to funnel via Wernicke’s area and all language output to funnel via [[Broca’s area]], it became extremely difficult to identify the basic properties of each region. This lack of clear definition for the contribution of Wernicke’s and Broca’s regions to human language rendered it extremely difficult to identify their homologues in other primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aboitiz F, García VR | title = The evolutionary origin of the language areas in the human brain.

=== {{Anchor|Auditory ventral stream}} Auditory ventral stream ===

The auditory ventral stream (AVS) connects the [[auditory cortex]] with the [[middle temporal gyrus]] and [[temporal pole]], which in turn connects with the [[inferior frontal gyrus]]. This pathway is responsible for sound recognition, and is accordingly known as the auditory 'what' pathway. The functions of the AVS include the following.

==== Sound recognition ====
Accumulative converging evidence indicates that the AVS is involved in recognizing auditory objects. At the level of the primary auditory cortex, recordings from monkeys showed higher percentage of neurons selective for learned melodic sequences in area R than area A1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yin P, Mishkin M, Sutter M, Fritz JB | title = Early stages of melody processing: stimulus-sequence and task-dependent neuronal activity in monkey auditory cortical fields A1 and R | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 100 | issue = 6 | pages = 3009–29 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18842950 | doi = 10.1152/jn.00828.2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a study in humans demonstrated more selectivity for heard syllables in the anterior Heschl’s gyrus (area hR) than posterior Heshcl’s gyrus (area hA1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steinschneider M, Volkov IO, Fishman YI, Oya H, Arezzo JC, Howard MA | title = Intracortical responses in human and monkey primary auditory cortex support a temporal processing mechanism for encoding of the voice onset time phonetic parameter | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 170–86 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15238437 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhh120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In downstream associative auditory fields, studies from both monkeys and humans reported that the border between the anterior and posterior auditory fields (Figure 1-area PC in the monkey and mSTG in the human) processes pitch attributes that are necessary for the recognition of auditory objects.&lt;ref name="Bendor D 2006"/&gt; The anterior auditory fields of monkeys were also demonstrated with selectivity for con-specific vocalizations with intra-cortical recordings.&lt;ref name="Perrodin_2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rauschecker_1995" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Russ BE, Ackelson AL, Baker AE, Cohen YE | title = Coding of auditory-stimulus identity in the auditory non-spatial processing stream | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 99 | issue = 1 | pages = 87–95 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18003874 | doi = 10.1152/jn.01069.2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and functional imaging&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Joly O, Pallier C, Ramus F, Pressnitzer D, Vanduffel W, Orban GA | title = Processing of vocalizations in humans and monkeys: a comparative fMRI study | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 1376–89 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22659478 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.05.070 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petkov_2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; One fMRI monkey study further demonstrated a role of the aSTG in the recognition of individual voices.&lt;ref name="Petkov_2008" /&gt; The role of the human mSTG-aSTG in sound recognition was demonstrated via functional imaging studies that correlated activity in this region with isolation of auditory objects from background noise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scheich H, Baumgart F, Gaschler-Markefski B, Tegeler C, Tempelmann C, Heinze HJ, Schindler F, Stiller D | title = Functional magnetic resonance imaging of a human auditory cortex area involved in foreground-background decomposition | journal = The European Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 803–9 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9749748 | doi = 10.1046/j.1460-9568.1998.00086.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zatorre RJ, Bouffard M, Belin P | title = Sensitivity to auditory object features in human temporal neocortex | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 24 | issue = 14 | pages = 3637–42 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15071112 | doi = 10.1523/jneurosci.5458-03.2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the recognition of spoken words,&lt;ref name="Binder JR p055"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Binder JR, Desai RH, Graves WW, Conant LL | title = Where is the semantic system?

In humans, downstream to the aSTG, the MTG and TP are thought to constitute the semantic lexicon, which is a long-term memory repository of audio-visual representations that are interconnected on the basis of semantic relationships. (See also the reviews by&lt;ref name="Hickok_2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gow_2012" /&gt; discussing this topic). The primary evidence for this role of the MTG-TP is that patients with damage to this region (e.g., patients with [[semantic dementia]] or [[herpesviral encephalitis|herpes simplex virus encephalitis]]) are reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Noppeney U, Patterson K, Tyler LK, Moss H, Stamatakis EA, Bright P, Mummery C, Price CJ | title = Temporal lobe lesions and semantic impairment: a comparison of herpes simplex virus encephalitis and semantic dementia | journal = Brain | volume = 130 | issue = Pt 4 | pages = 1138–47 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17251241 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awl344 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patterson K, Nestor PJ, Rogers TT | title = Where do you know what you know?

==== Sentence comprehension ====
In addition to extracting meaning from sounds, the MTG-TP region of the AVS appears to have a role in sentence comprehension, possibly by merging concepts together (e.g., merging the concept 'blue' and 'shirt to create the concept of a 'blue shirt'). The role of the MTG in extracting meaning from sentences has been demonstrated in functional imaging studies reporting stronger activation in the anterior MTG when proper sentences are contrasted with lists of words, sentences in a foreign or nonsense language, scrambled sentences, sentences with semantic or syntactic violations and sentence-like sequences of environmental sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mazoyer BM, Tzourio N, Frak V, Syrota A, Murayama N, Levrier O, Salamon G, Dehaene S, Cohen L, Mehler J | title = The cortical representation of speech | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 467–79 | date = October 1993 | pmid = 23964919 | doi = 10.1162/jocn.1993.5.4.467 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Humphries C, Love T, Swinney D, Hickok G | title = Response of anterior temporal cortex to syntactic and prosodic manipulations during sentence processing | journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 128–38 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 15895428 | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Humphries C, Willard K, Buchsbaum B, Hickok G | title = Role of anterior temporal cortex in auditory sentence comprehension: an fMRI study | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 12 | issue = 8 | pages = 1749–52 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11409752 | doi = 10.1097/00001756-200106130-00046 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vandenberghe R, Nobre AC, Price CJ | title = The response of left temporal cortex to sentences | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 550–60 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12126497 | doi = 10.1162/08989290260045800 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friederici AD, Rüschemeyer SA, Hahne A, Fiebach CJ | title = The role of left inferior frontal and superior temporal cortex in sentence comprehension: localizing syntactic and semantic processes | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 170–7 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12507948 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/13.2.170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friederici AD, Rüschemeyer SA, Hahne A, Fiebach CJ | title = The role of left inferior frontal and superior temporal cortex in sentence comprehension: localizing syntactic and semantic processes | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 170–7 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12507948 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.12.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogalsky C, Hickok G | title = Selective attention to semantic and syntactic features modulates sentence processing networks in anterior temporal cortex | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 786–96 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 18669589 | pmc = 2651476 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhn126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pallier C, Devauchelle AD, Dehaene S | title = Cortical representation of the constituent structure of sentences | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 6 | pages = 2522–7 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21224415 | pmc = 3038732 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1018711108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One fMRI study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brennan J, Nir Y, Hasson U, Malach R, Heeger DJ, Pylkkänen L | title = Syntactic structure building in the anterior temporal lobe during natural story listening | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 163–73 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 20472279 | pmc = 2947556 | doi = 10.1016/j.bandl.2010.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which participants were instructed to read a story further correlated activity in the anterior MTG with the amount of semantic and syntactic content each sentence contained.

==== Bilaterality ====
In contradiction to the Wernicke-Lichtheim-Geschwind model that implicates sound recognition to occur solely in the left hemisphere, studies that examined the properties of the right or left hemisphere in isolation via unilateral hemispheric anesthesia (i.e., the WADA procedure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hickok G, Okada K, Barr W, Pa J, Rogalsky C, Donnelly K, Barde L, Grant A | title = Bilateral capacity for speech sound processing in auditory comprehension: evidence from Wada procedures | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 107 | issue = 3 | pages = 179–84 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18976806 | doi = 10.1016/j.bandl.2008.09.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) or intra-cortical recordings from each hemisphere&lt;ref name="Creutzfeldt_1989" /&gt; provided evidence that [[sound recognition]] is processed bilaterally. Moreover, a study that instructed patients with disconnected hemispheres (i.e., [[split-brain]] patients) to match spoken words to written words presented to the right or left hemifields, reported vocabulary in the right hemisphere that almost matches in size with the left hemisphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaidel|first=Eran | name-list-format = vanc |date= September 1976|title=Auditory Vocabulary of the Right Hemisphere Following Brain Bisection or Hemidecortication | journal=Cortex|volume=12|issue=3|pages=191–211|doi=10.1016/s0010-9452(76)80001-9|issn=0010-9452}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The right hemisphere vocabulary was equivalent to the vocabulary of a healthy 11-years old child). This bilateral recognition of sounds is also consistent with the finding that unilateral lesion to the auditory cortex rarely results in deficit to auditory comprehension (i.e., [[auditory agnosia]]), whereas a second lesion to the remaining hemisphere (which could occur years later) does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Poeppel D | date = October 2001 |title=Pure word deafness and the bilateral processing of the speech code | journal=Cognitive Science |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=679–693 |doi=10.1016/s0364-0213(01)00050-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ulrich G | title = Interhemispheric functional relationships in auditory agnosia.

=== {{Anchor|Auditory dorsal stream}} Auditory dorsal stream ===

The auditory dorsal stream connects the auditory cortex with the [[parietal lobe]], which in turn connects with [[inferior frontal gyrus]]. In both humans and non-human primates, the auditory dorsal stream is responsible for sound localization, and is accordingly known as the auditory 'where' pathway. In humans, this pathway (especially in the left hemisphere) is also responsible for speech production, speech repetition, lip-reading, and phonological working memory and long-term memory.

==== Speech production ====
Studies of present-day humans have demonstrated a role for the ADS in speech production, particularly in the vocal expression of the names of objects. For instance, in a series of studies in which sub-cortical fibers were directly stimulated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duffau H | title = The anatomo-functional connectivity of language revisited.

==== Vocal mimicry ====
Although sound perception is primarily ascribed with the AVS, the ADS appears associated with several aspects of speech perception.

An intra-cortical recording study in which participants were instructed to identify syllables also correlated the hearing of each syllable with its own activation pattern in the pSTG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chang EF, Rieger JW, Johnson K, Berger MS, Barbaro NM, Knight RT | title = Categorical speech representation in human superior temporal gyrus | language = En | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 13 | issue = 11 | pages = 1428–32 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20890293 | pmc = 2967728 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2641 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The involvement of the ADS in both speech perception and production has been further illuminated in several pioneering functional imaging studies that contrasted speech perception with overt or covert speech production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Buchsbaum BR, Hickok G, Humphries C | date= September 2001 |title=Role of left posterior superior temporal gyrus in phonological processing for speech perception and production |journal=Cognitive Science |volume=25|issue=5|pages=663–678|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2505_2|issn=0364-0213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wise RJ, Scott SK, Blank SC, Mummery CJ, Murphy K, Warburton EA | title = Separate neural subsystems within 'Wernicke's area' | journal = Brain | volume = 124 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 83–95 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11133789 | doi = 10.1093/brain/124.1.83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hickok G, Buchsbaum B, Humphries C, Muftuler T | title = Auditory-motor interaction revealed by fMRI: speech, music, and working memory in area Spt | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 673–82 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12965041 | doi = 10.1162/089892903322307393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies demonstrated that the pSTS is active only during the perception of speech, whereas area Spt is active during both the perception and production of speech.

==== Speech monitoring ====
In addition to repeating and producing speech, the ADS appears to have a role in monitoring the quality of the speech output. Neuroanatomical evidence suggests that the ADS is equipped with descending connections from the IFG to the pSTG that relay information about motor activity (i.e., corollary discharges) in the vocal apparatus (mouth, tongue, vocal folds). This feedback marks the sound perceived during speech production as self-produced and can be used to adjust the vocal apparatus to increase the similarity between the perceived and emitted calls. Evidence for descending connections from the IFG to the pSTG has been offered by a study that electrically stimulated the IFG during surgical operations and reported the spread of activation to the pSTG-pSTS-Spt region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matsumoto R, Nair DR, LaPresto E, Najm I, Bingaman W, Shibasaki H, Lüders HO | title = Functional connectivity in the human language system: a cortico-cortical evoked potential study | journal = Brain | volume = 127 | issue = Pt 10 | pages = 2316–30 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15269116 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awh246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimura D, Watson N | title = The relation between oral movement control and speech | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 565–90 | date = November 1989 | pmid = 2479446 | doi = 10.1016/0093-934x(89)90112-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that compared the ability of aphasic patients with frontal, parietal or temporal lobe damage to quickly and repeatedly articulate a string of syllables reported that damage to the frontal lobe interfered with the articulation of both identical syllabic strings (“Bababa”) and non-identical syllabic strings (“Badaga”), whereas patients with temporal or parietal lobe damage only exhibited impairment when articulating non-identical syllabic strings. Because the patients with temporal and parietal lobe damage were capable of repeating the syllabic string in the first task, their speech perception and production appears to be relatively preserved, and their deficit in the second task is therefore due to impaired monitoring. Demonstrating the role of the descending ADS connections in monitoring emitted calls, an fMRI study instructed participants to speak under normal conditions or when hearing a modified version of their own voice (delayed first formant) and reported that hearing a distorted version of one’s own voice results in increased activation in the pSTG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tourville JA, Reilly KJ, Guenther FH | title = Neural mechanisms underlying auditory feedback control of speech | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 1429–43 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18035557 | pmc = 3658624 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.09.054 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further demonstrating that the ADS facilitates motor feedback during mimicry is an intra-cortical recording study that contrasted speech perception and repetition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Towle VL, Yoon HA, Castelle M, Edgar JC, Biassou NM, Frim DM, Spire JP, Kohrman MH | title = ECoG gamma activity during a language task: differentiating expressive and receptive speech areas | journal = Brain | volume = 131 | issue = Pt 8 | pages = 2013–27 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18669510 | pmc = 2724904 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awn147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors reported that, in addition to activation in the IPL and IFG, speech repetition is characterized by stronger activation in the pSTG than during speech perception. 

==== Integration of phonemes with lip-movements ====
Although sound perception is primarily ascribed with the AVS, the ADS appears associated with several aspects of speech perception. For instance, in a meta-analysis of fMRI studies&lt;ref name="Turkeltaub_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Turkeltaub PE, Coslett HB | title = Localization of sublexical speech perception components | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 114 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20413149 | pmc = 2914564 | doi = 10.1016/j.bandl.2010.03.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the auditory perception of phonemes was contrasted with closely matching sounds, and the studies were rated for the required level of attention, the authors concluded that attention to phonemes correlates with strong activation in the pSTG-pSTS region. An intra-cortical recording study in which participants were instructed to identify syllables also correlated the hearing of each syllable with its own activation pattern in the pSTG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chang EF, Rieger JW, Johnson K, Berger MS, Barbaro NM, Knight RT | title = Categorical speech representation in human superior temporal gyrus | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 13 | issue = 11 | pages = 1428–32 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20890293 | pmc = 2967728 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2641 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the role of the ADS in discriminating phonemes,&lt;ref name="Turkeltaub_2010" /&gt; studies have ascribed the integration of phonemes and their corresponding lip movements (i.e., visemes) to the pSTS of the ADS. For example, an fMRI study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nath AR, Beauchamp MS | title = A neural basis for interindividual differences in the McGurk effect, a multisensory speech illusion | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 781–7 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 21787869 | pmc = 3196040 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.07.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has correlated activation in the pSTS with the McGurk illusion (in which hearing the syllable “ba” while seeing the viseme “ga” results in the perception of the syllable “da”). Another study has found that using magnetic stimulation to interfere with processing in this area further disrupts the McGurk illusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beauchamp MS, Nath AR, Pasalar S | title = fMRI-Guided transcranial magnetic stimulation reveals that the superior temporal sulcus is a cortical locus of the McGurk effect | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 30 | issue = 7 | pages = 2414–7 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20164324 | pmc = 2844713 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4865-09.2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The association of the pSTS with the audio-visual integration of speech has also been demonstrated in a study that presented participants with pictures of faces and spoken words of varying quality.

==== Phonological long-term memory ====
A growing body of evidence indicates that humans, in addition to having a long-term store for word meanings located in the MTG-TP of the AVS (i.e., the semantic lexicon), also have a long-term store for the names of objects located in the Spt-IPL region of the ADS (i.e., the phonological lexicon). For example, a study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwartz MF, Faseyitan O, Kim J, Coslett HB | title = The dorsal stream contribution to phonological retrieval in object naming | journal = Brain | volume = 135 | issue = Pt 12 | pages = 3799–814 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23171662 | pmc = 3525060 | doi = 10.1093/brain/aws300 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwartz MF, Kimberg DY, Walker GM, Faseyitan O, Brecher A, Dell GS, Coslett HB | title = Anterior temporal involvement in semantic word retrieval: voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping evidence from aphasia | journal = Brain | volume = 132 | issue = Pt 12 | pages = 3411–27 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19942676 | pmc = 2792374 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awp284 }}&lt;/ref&gt; examining patients with damage to the AVS (MTG damage) or damage to the ADS (IPL damage) reported that MTG damage results in individuals incorrectly identifying objects (e.g., calling a “goat” a “sheep,” an example of [[Paraphasia|semantic paraphasia]]). Conversely, IPL damage results in individuals correctly identifying the object but incorrectly pronouncing its name (e.g., saying “gof” instead of “goat,” an example of [[Paraphasia|phonemic paraphasia]]). Semantic paraphasia errors have also been reported in patients receiving intra-cortical electrical stimulation of the AVS (MTG), and phonemic paraphasia errors have been reported in patients whose ADS (pSTG, Spt, and IPL) received intra-cortical electrical stimulation.&lt;ref name="Roux_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roux FE, Miskin K, Durand JB, Sacko O, Réhault E, Tanova R, Démonet JF | title = Electrostimulation mapping of comprehension of auditory and visual words | journal = Cortex; A Journal Devoted to the Study of the Nervous System and Behavior | volume = 71 | pages = 398–408 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26332785 | doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2015.07.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ojemann|first=George A. | name-list-format = vanc |date= June 1983 |title=Brain organization for language from the perspective of electrical stimulation mapping |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume=6|issue=2|pages=189–206|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00015491|issn=1469-1825}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duffau_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duffau H | title = The anatomo-functional connectivity of language revisited.

==== Phonological working memory ====
[[Working memory]] is often treated as the temporary activation of the representations stored in long-term memory that are used for speech (phonological representations). This sharing of resources between working memory and speech is evident by the finding&lt;ref name="Baddeley_1984"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baddeley |first=Alan |last2=Lewis |first2=Vivien |last3=Vallar |first3=Giuseppe | name-list-format = vanc | date = May 1984 |title=Exploring the Articulatory Loop |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology Section A | volume=36|issue=2|pages=233–252|doi=10.1080/14640748408402157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowan_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cowan N | title = The magical number 4 in short-term memory: a reconsideration of mental storage capacity | journal = The Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 87–114; discussion 114–85 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11515286 | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X01003922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that speaking during rehearsal results in a significant reduction in the number of items that can be recalled from working memory ([[articulatory suppression]]).

===== Sound localization =====
The most established role of the ADS is with audiospatial processing. This is evidenced via studies that recorded neural activity from the auditory cortex of monkeys, and correlated the strongest selectivity to changes in sound location with the posterior auditory fields (areas CM-CL), intermediate selectivity with primary area A1, and very weak selectivity with the anterior auditory fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benson DA, Hienz RD, Goldstein MH | title = Single-unit activity in the auditory cortex of monkeys actively localizing sound sources: spatial tuning and behavioral dependency | journal = Brain Research | volume = 219 | issue = 2 | pages = 249–67 | date = August 1981 | pmid = 7260632 | doi = 10.1016/0006-8993(81)90290-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller LM, Recanzone GH | title = Populations of auditory cortical neurons can accurately encode acoustic space across stimulus intensity | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 106 | issue = 14 | pages = 5931–5 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19321750 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0901023106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rauschecker_1995"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rauschecker JP, Tian B, Hauser M | title = Processing of complex sounds in the macaque nonprimary auditory cortex | journal = Science | volume = 268 | issue = 5207 | pages = 111–4 | date = April 1995 | pmid = 7701330 | doi = 10.1126/science.7701330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tian_2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woods TM, Lopez SE, Long JH, Rahman JE, Recanzone GH | title = Effects of stimulus azimuth and intensity on the single-neuron activity in the auditory cortex of the alert macaque monkey | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 96 | issue = 6 | pages = 3323–37 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 16943318 | doi = 10.1152/jn.00392.2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, behavioral studies of brain damaged patients&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clarke S, Bellmann A, Meuli RA, Assal G, Steck AJ | title = Auditory agnosia and auditory spatial deficits following left hemispheric lesions: evidence for distinct processing pathways | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 797–807 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10689055 | doi = 10.1016/s0028-3932(99)00141-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Griffiths TD, Rees A, Witton C, Shakir RA, Henning GB, Green GG | title = Evidence for a sound movement area in the human cerebral cortex | journal = Nature | volume = 383 | issue = 6599 | pages = 425–7 | date = October 1996 | pmid = 8837772 | doi = 10.1038/383425a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and EEG recordings from healthy participants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anourova I, Nikouline VV, Ilmoniemi RJ, Hotta J, Aronen HJ, Carlson S | title = Evidence for dissociation of spatial and nonspatial auditory information processing | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 1268–77 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11707083 | doi = 10.1006/nimg.2001.0903 }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that sound localization is processed independently of sound recognition, and thus is likely independent of processing in the AVS.

===== Guidance of eye movements =====
In addition to localizing sounds, the ADS appears also to encode the sound location in memory, and to use this information for guiding eye movements. Evidence for the role of the ADS in encoding sounds into working memory is provided via studies that trained monkeys in a delayed matching to sample task, and reported of activation in areas CM-CL&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gottlieb Y, Vaadia E, Abeles M | title = Single unit activity in the auditory cortex of a monkey performing a short term memory task | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 74 | issue = 1 | pages = 139–48 | date = 1989 | pmid = 2924831 | doi = 10.1007/bf00248287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and IPS&lt;ref name="Linden JF 1999"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Linden JF, Grunewald A, Andersen RA | title = Responses to auditory stimuli in macaque lateral intraparietal area.

===== Integration of locations with auditory objects =====
A surprising function of the ADS is with the discrimination and possible identification of sounds, which is commonly ascribed with the anterior STG and STS of the AVS. However, electrophysiological recordings from the posterior auditory cortex (areas CM-CL),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Recanzone GH | title = Representation of con-specific vocalizations in the core and belt areas of the auditory cortex in the alert macaque monkey | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 28 | issue = 49 | pages = 13184–93 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19052209 | doi = 10.1523/jneurosci.3619-08.2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tian_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tian B, Reser D, Durham A, Kustov A, Rauschecker JP | title = Functional specialization in rhesus monkey auditory cortex | journal = Science | volume = 292 | issue = 5515 | pages = 290–3 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11303104 | doi = 10.1126/science.1058911 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and IPS of monkeys,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gifford GW, Cohen YE | title = Spatial and non-spatial auditory processing in the lateral intraparietal area | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 162 | issue = 4 | pages = 509–12 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15864568 | doi = 10.1007/s00221-005-2220-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well a PET monkey study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gil-da-Costa R, Martin A, Lopes MA, Muñoz M, Fritz JB, Braun AR | title = Species-specific calls activate homologs of Broca's and Wernicke's areas in the macaque | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 1064–70 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16862150 | doi = 10.1038/nn1741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reported of neurons that are selective to monkey vocalizations. One of these studies&lt;ref name="Tian_2001" /&gt; also reported of neurons in areas CM-CL that are characterized with dual selectivity for both a vocalization and a sound location.

This study thus suggests that the ADS is capable of identifying voices in addition to discriminating them.

The manner in which sound recognition in the pSTG-PT-Spt regions of the ADS differs from sound recognition in the anterior STG and STS of the AVS&lt;ref name="Andics_2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Belin2003&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Belin P, Zatorre RJ | title = Adaptation to speaker's voice in right anterior temporal lobe | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 14 | issue = 16 | pages = 2105–2109 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14600506 | doi = 10.1097/00001756-200311140-00019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakamura K, Kawashima R, Sugiura M, Kato T, Nakamura A, Hatano K, Nagumo S, Kubota K, Fukuda H, Ito K, Kojima S | title = Neural substrates for recognition of familiar voices: a PET study | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 39 | issue = 10 | pages = 1047–54 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11440757 | doi = 10.1016/s0028-3932(01)00037-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perrodin_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Petkov_2008" /&gt; was shown via electro-stimulation of an epileptic patient.&lt;ref name="Lachaux_2007" /&gt; This study reported that electro-stimulation of the aSTG resulted in changes in the perceived pitch of voices (including the patient’s own voice), whereas electro-stimulation of the pSTG resulted in reports that her voice was “drifting away.” This report indicates a role for the pSTG in the integration of sound location with an individual voice. Consistent with this role of the ADS is a study that reported patients, with AVS damage but spared ADS (surgical removal of the anterior STG/MTG), were no longer capable of isolating environmental sounds in the contralesional space, whereas their ability of isolating and discriminating human voices remained intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Efron R, Crandall PH | title = Central auditory processing.

It is presently unknown why so many functions are ascribed to the human ADS.&amp;nbsp;An attempt to unify these functions under a single framework was conducted in the ‘From where to what’ model of language evolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Poliva O | title = From where to what: a neuroanatomically based evolutionary model of the emergence of speech in humans | journal = F1000Research | volume = 4 | pages = 67 | date = 2017-09-20 | pmid = 28928931 | doi = 10.12688/f1000research.6175.3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Poliva O | title = From Mimicry to Language: A Neuroanatomically Based Evolutionary Model of the Emergence of Vocal Language | journal = Frontiers in Neuroscience | volume = 10 | pages = 307 | date = 2016-06-30 | pmid = 27445676 | doi = 10.3389/fnins.2016.00307  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with this model, each function of the ADS indicates of a different intermediate phase in the evolution of language. The roles of sound localization and integration of sound location with voices and auditory objects is interpreted as evidence that the origin of speech is the exchange of contact calls (calls used to report location in cases of separation) between mothers and offspring. The role of the ADS in the perception and production of intonations is interpreted as evidence that speech began by modifying the contact calls with intonations, possibly for distinguishing alarm contact calls from safe contact calls. The role of the ADS in encoding the names of objects (phonological long-term memory) is interpreted as evidence of gradual transition from modifying calls with intonations to complete vocal control. The role of the ADS in the integration of lip movements with phonemes and in speech repetition is interpreted as evidence that spoken words were learned by infants mimicking their parents’ vocalizations, initiailly by imitating their lip movements. The role of the ADS in phonological working memory is interpreted as evidence that the words learned through mimicry remained active in the ADS even when not spoken. This resulted with individuals capable of rehearsing a list of vocalizations, which enabled the production of words with several syllables. Further developments in the ADS enabled the rehearsal of lists of words, which provided the infra-structure for communicating with sentences.

'''''Legion of Super Heroes''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[animated television series]] produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]], adapted from the [[DC Comics]] series of the same name. It debuted on September 23, 2006, and centers on a [[Superboy (Kal-El)|young Superman]]'s adventures in the 31st century. Superman is fighting alongside the eponymous group of superheroes. The show was produced by its main designer James Tucker, a co-producer of the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' series, for the [[Kids' WB]] line on [[The CW Television Network|The CW]] network.

The series drew on the rich history of the Legion of Super-Heroes, taking inspiration from stories set during all time periods of the team's nearly 50-year history in comics. [[Continuity (fiction)|Continuity]] is internally consistent but is not shared with any previous incarnation of the Legion, either animated or in print. The series was cancelled after its second season.&lt;ref name="legionend"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=95 | title='Legion of Super Heroes' To End After Current Season | work=World's Finest Online | date=March 12, 2008 | last=Harvey | first=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development history==
Despite the Legion having previously appeared in episodes of various series in the [[DC animated universe]] (DCAU), the Legion's show was deliberately created from scratch as opposed to a [[Spin-off (media)|spinoff]] or [[Television pilot#Backdoor_pilot|back-door pilot]] from the DCAU. According to series producer [[James Tucker (producer)|James Tucker]]:
:Let's get the myths out of the way. The Legion series was never tied to the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode. [[Supergirl]] was never, ever going to be in the Legion. The true origin of the series came out of [[Cartoon Network]]'s desire to have a [[Superman]]-centric series to premiere when the movie ''[[Superman Returns]]'' premiered. Superman as part of the Legion worked for them. So the series was originally developed for Cartoon Network, then they passed and [[Kids' WB]]! stepped in. They, too, wanted a Superman-centric series with Superman fresh out of [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], learning to be Superman. That's the reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/2008/04/tucker-discusses-legion-of-super-heroes-history-finale/ | title=Tucker Discusses “Legion of Super Heroes” History &amp; Finale | work=World's Finest Online | date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early reports had suggested the title of the series would be ''Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes'', but the official announcement on April 24, 2006 confirmed the title as ''Legion of Super Heroes''. The same announcement indicated that the series would air on the [[Kids' WB]] block of the new [[The CW Television Network|The CW]] network at 10 a.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/networktv/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002384275 |title=CW Sticks With Kids WB! |work=Mediaweek |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515124303/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/networktv/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002384275 |archivedate=May 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal status/issues===
At the 2006 [[Comic Con International]], the production staff did not officially say whether [[Superboy#Legal status|current legal issues]] involving the ownership of Superboy had affected this series or whether changes were made to tie the series in with the ''[[Superman Returns]]'' movie, but one significant change had been made since the announcement of the series. The original press release referred to "the young Superboy",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20060424cw01 | title=Kids' Wb! on the CW Announces 2006–2007 "Too Big for Your TV" Saturday Morning Programming Schedule | work=TheFutonCritic.com | date=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the revised press release, published in June 2006, described the character as a young ''Superman''. At the conclusion of the pilot episode, Clark adopts the superhero name of Superman, and not Superboy. In the second season, which takes place two years after the end of the first season, the character is called Superman, without reference to his "young" status.

===Second season===
The second season has a much darker and more mature tone than the first season and mostly focuses on Brainiac 5 and his relationship with his evil ancestor, the original [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. In the second season, most of the Legionnaires have changed their appearances, e.g., Lightning Lad has longer hair and gets a robotic arm. Their appearances change based on the two years without Superman after he left in the episode "Sundown Part 2", which is the finale of the first season. Triplicate Girl changes her codename to Duo Damsel because one of her bodies (the White Body) is lost in a temporal anomaly during one of their 41st Century's battles. The series logo was also slightly revised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0702/08/index.htm | title=The Batman, Legion of Super Heroes New Seasons | work=Comics Continuum | first=Rob | last=Allstetter | date=February 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the first season, a total of 13 episodes were created for the second season, which premiered on September 22, 2007. The show was not renewed for a third season.&lt;ref name="legionend"/&gt;

===Proposed third season===
A third season had been planned for production but was dropped because the Kids' WB! slot was taken over by 4Kids. The third season was intended to take place three years after the end of the second season in which an older Superman would return. [[Sensor (comics)|Sensor]], [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]], [[Magnetic Kid]], [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], [[Tellus (comics)|Tellus]], [[Princess Projectra]] and [[Shadow Lass]] were to be introduced, while background characters [[Blok (comics)|Blok]] and [[Dawnstar]] would have active roles. Kell-El was intended to be a regular character but with a reduced role. The main focus of the third season would have been Brainiac 5's return, while trying to redeem himself after the second season's finale and the evil Brainiac 6 trying to destroy the Legion. Also, producer [[James Tucker (producer)|James Tucker]] planned to make an episode adaptation of the story "The Ghost of Ferro Lad" to introduce [[Ferro Lad]]'s long lost twin brother who would have become Kell-El's replacement in the Legion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/bravebold/backstage/interviews/wftucker.php&lt;/ref&gt; The final episode of season two linked the two seasons together.&lt;ref name="jamestucker"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=117 | title=The World's Finest: Tucker Discusses 'Legion of Super Heroes' History &amp; Finale | work=World's Finest Online | date=April 4, 2008 | last=Harvey | first=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=15931 | work=Comic Book Resources | title=Producer James Tucker Looks Back on 'Legion of Super-Heroes' | date=April 9, 2008 | last=Renaud | first=Jeffrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
[[File:Legion of Super Heroes promo.jpg|thumb|upright|From left to right: Bouncing Boy, Saturn Girl, Brainiac 5, Superman, Phantom Girl, Timber Wolf, and Lightning Lad.]]
In the first season, the series revolved around a core group of eight Legionnaires but others appeared from time to time in recurring roles, similar in format to the ''Justice League Unlimited'' animated series.

===Superman===
The first season introduces a teenaged Clark Kent who is about to move from [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] to Metropolis. He knows of his abilities but does not know what to do with his future (similar in nature to the Clark Kent featured in the ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' television series). After travelling to the future, young Clark assumes the identity of Superman and gradually learns to control his abilities, becoming the hero he is destined to be. At the end of the first season, he returns to the present around the same time he left in the first episode.

In the second season, Superman returns to the future after spending two years in the past and gaining more experience with his powers. A second Superman, called "[[Superman X]]", also appears in the second season. This Superman, later given the name Kell-El. Is from the 41st century and was created from Superman's DNA and [[Kryptonite]] as a living weapon with different abilities. His main foe in the 41st century is [[Imperiex]], who travels through time to the 31st century, forcing Superman X to follow him into the past and recruit the Legion to help him.

===Core Legionnaires===
Series producer James Tucker offered descriptions of the core team in a July 2006 interview at [[Comic Con International]] in San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/SDCC06/DC/Animation/Legion_Tucker.html |work=[[Newsarama]] |title=SDCC '06: James Tucker talks WB Animation's Legion |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060805071013/http://www.newsarama.com/SDCC06/DC/Animation/Legion_Tucker.html |archivedate=August 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other DC team shows such as ''Justice League Unlimited'', not every core character appears in all episodes. The following descriptions apply to the characters as seen in the first season.

* [[Garth Ranzz|Lightning Lad]] is the eager and hot-headed unofficial leader of the team. Prone to fighting first and thinking later, he can come off as brash at first but is usually well-intentioned. The lightning bolt scar on his right eye sometimes flashes brightly in times of battle. In the episode "Chained Lightning", Imperiex destroys his right arm, which he replaces with a bionic arm. He was one of the founding members of the Legion and has a twin sister, Ayla, and an older brother, Mekt.
* [[Saturn Girl]] is a level-headed character with mental powers. She is composed at all times but also very physical. Among her mental powers are abilities not traditionally associated with the character in the comics, such as [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]] and the power to mentally create an explosive force field called a thought blast (which is so draining that she passes out afterwards) and the ability to go into a healing trance when unconscious (she can still mentally hear others in this state). In the premiere of the second season, she is put into a healing trance after a battle with Esper and awakens in the ninth episode of the season. She is a founding member of the Legion.
* [[Brainiac 5]] is the series' youngest (as of Season One) and smartest Legionnaire. He can transform his robot body in various ways. For the purposes of the show, his character has been altered by making him an outright robot (the comic book version is flesh-and-blood). His deep desire, though, is to be more human, like his teammates. This version of Brainiac 5 is closest to the "[[Legion of Super-Heroes (1994 team)|reboot]]" version in personality and includes the robotic aspects of the character [[Gear (comics)|Gear]].{{Original research inline|date=November 2010}} James Tucker has always thought of him as kind of a "[[Little Man Tate]]"-type character: a kid who is so smart, he is sent to college when he is only 12. Tucker has said he was inspired by [[Oliver Coipel]]'s rendition of the character when designing this rendition for the series. A holographic representation of his deepest fear in the first-season episode "Fear Factory" implies that his people, the [[Coluans]], do not approve of his desire to emulate humanoids. He greatly desires Superman's friendship. In the season two finale, he turns into a human and leaves the Legion until he can adjust to his new human emotions. Brainiac 1.0, who was destroyed by Brainiac 5, was resurrected as Brainiac 6 at the end of the last produced episode of the series.
* [[Phantom Girl]] is, according to James Tucker, "a princess who is kind of spoiled, but ultimately very devoted to being in the Legion. She has a somewhat sarcastic attitude to cover the fact that she really gets a kick out of finally being with other kids like herself." In addition to her powers established in preview comics stories, she has displayed the ability to turn other people and objects temporarily intangible, though this seems to strain her. Phantom Girl has also been shown to disrupt electrical systems by passing through them. Her mother is the president of the United Planets. She is most often seen with Timber Wolf, for whom she seems to have some feelings.
* [[Bouncing Boy]] is a friendly young man who used to possess a Normal Shape and size and had the ability to take on his Bouncing Boy shape at will until a Battle where he was hit by a Ray that should have killed him but instead stuck him in his "Ball Shape" unable to transform "Back and Forth" any longer at will. He enjoys eating and is sometimes played up as the comedic character. James Tucker considers him the every man member of the Legion: "In a lot of ways he plays [[Leonard McCoy|Bones]] to Brainiac 5's [[Spock]]." In the first-season episode "Chain of Command", Bouncing Boy is elected leader of the Legionnaires, much to his own surprise, although he loses command in the two years between the seasons. He and Triplicate Girl seem to be in a romantic relationship as they are constantly flirting with each other.
* [[Luorno Durgo|Triplicate Girl]], also known as Duo Damsel, is one girl who was born with the power to transform into three nearly identical selves. She has demonstrated martial arts skills and natural teamwork. On the team, she often operates communications, and appears to have an attraction to Bouncing Boy (a nod to their pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' marriage). When one of her duplicates is killed in the paradox created by Imperiex in the 41st century, she becomes known as Duo Damsel. The emotional dismay her two other selves show at her death suggests that each of her "triplicates" has a semi-separate awareness and identity. At the end of the second season, the white duplicate returns from the future alive and well.
* [[Timber Wolf (comics)|Timber Wolf]] debuted in the self-titled second episode. Brin Londo, as a result of his father's experiments on him, is transformed into a [[werewolf]]-like creature with enhanced speed, strength, agility, and senses. However, he also lost control over himself, becoming a fierce beast who acts on instinct and impulse. Only with Saturn Girl's help is he able to re-establish some level of control, turning into a more humanoid form, though still possessing wolf-like attributes. Soon afterward, he joins the Legion and takes his code name in honor of past heroes. James Tucker described him as "a loner [who] longs to be closer to people. His appearance makes him look a bit feral, but his personality is anything but. He's the cool dude who's actually insecure inside."
* [[Reep Daggle|Chameleon Boy]] debuted in the first episode of the second season as one of the newest members of the Legion. He has the ability to [[Shape shifting|shape shift]] all or part of his body into something else, animate or inanimate, as well as utilize the strength and power of what he transforms into. His father funds the Legion, which allows them access to expensive material, such as battle cruisers. Chameleon Boy seems to be one of the few members of the team that has a fun-loving and sarcastic disposition, the reason of which being that the rest of the team has had to deal with so many issues the past couple of years, they have become more solemn. He is good friends with Karate Kid.

===Other Legionnaires===
[[XS (comics)|XS]] appears in the final two episodes "Dark Victory" parts 1 and 2 as a background character. [[Dawnstar]] and [[Invisible Kid]] also appeared in these final two episodes along with many other rarely seen Legion members; however, none of the new members shown in these episodes did anything to the plot of the story itself.

In the first season, some Legionnaires were mentioned or shown as images before making an actual appearance. Fourteen members were shown during the season as already active: [[Blok (comics)|Blok]], [[Bouncing Boy]], [[Brainiac 5]], [[Gim Allon|Colossal Boy]], [[Cosmic Boy]], [[Nura Nal|Dream Girl]], [[Element Lad]], [[Garth Ranzz|Lightning Lad]], [[Phantom Girl]], [[Saturn Girl]], [[Salu Digby|Shrinking Violet]], [[Sun Boy]], [[Luorno Durgo|Triplicate Girl]], and [[Tyroc]]. Five more joined the Legion through the course of the series: Superman, [[Timber Wolf (comics)|Timber Wolf]], [[Matter-Eater Lad]], [[Thom Kallor|Star Boy]], and [[Ferro Lad]].

The opening credits sequences used for first-season episodes included a glimpse of the Mission Monitor Board signs for many Legionnaires as well as shots of flying Legionnaires who would be seen in later episodes (though not all of those with Mission Monitor Board symbols appeared). At least four members of the Legion as seen in the comics appeared in some way on the show but had not joined by the end of the first season ([[Ultra Boy]], [[Lightning Lass]], [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]], and [[Polar Boy]]).

In the second season, [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]] appeared in the opening credits with the other Legionnaires, though he did not appear until the fifth episode (in which [[Nemesis Kid]] also became a new member). Similar to Karate Kid, Sun Boy appeared in the second season opening titles and made semi-regular appearances but did not have a speaking line or have someone else refer to him by name. Ayla Ranzz, sister of Lightning Lad, finally made an appearance, but as a child without apparent super powers and not as the [[Light Lass]] of the comic books.

==''Legion of Super Heroes in the 31st Century''==
A [[comic book]] based on the show's continuity was published under the title ''Legion of Super-Heroes in the 31st Century''. According to the comic's writer, [[J. Torres]], the name was chosen to distinguish itself from more specifically youth-oriented titles such as ''[[Justice League Adventures]]'' and ''[[Superman Adventures]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=9622 | title=Torres Goes to the Future with 'Legion of Superheroes in the 31st Century' | accessdate=2007-07-22 | date=February 9, 2007 | work=Comic Book Resources | first=Arune | last=Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue was distributed during [[Free Comic Book Day]] 2007 in addition to being sold.

An interview concerning the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes in the 31st Century]]'' comic confirmed that the comic was to continue publication despite the series ending, and that the comic would also be telling stories that were to have taken place after the second-season finale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/interviews/interviews-intro.php?topic=c-interview_jtorres2 | work=Superman Homepage | title=Exclusive J.

==In other media==
A tie-in promotion with [[McDonald's]] [[Happy Meal]] took place in August 2007. The Legion show was represented by eight figures (Superman, Timber Wolf, Lightning Lad, Mano, Tharok, Brainiac 5, Bouncing Boy, and Validus). As Happy Meal toys often have a "girl toy" and "boy toy", this set was aimed at the boys.

Action figures by [[Mattel]] were not produced because of a lack of retailer interest. Mattel holds the master license for toys based on any DC series in any medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://thefwoosh.com/2007/11/interview-with-mattels-toy-guru-part-ii | title=Interview with Mattel's Toy Guru, Part II | work=TheFwoosh.com | date=November 16, 2007 | author=SamuRon | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115034944/http://thefwoosh.com/2007/11/interview-with-mattels-toy-guru-part-ii | archivedate=January 15, 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[collectible miniatures game]] [[HeroClix]] produced a special starter set of the Legion, including a figure of "Young Superman" during the first season.

'''Leopard Spotted Horses''' appear in [[Paleolithic]] [[cave paintings]]. These paintings depict white, spotted horses and experts cannot agree if they depict real or imagined animals. The difference is of importance as it would reveal tendencies to either realism or creativity in early human art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/2011/11/08/cave-painters-didnt-dream-up-spotted-horses-study-shows/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110200714/http://www.history.com/news/2011/11/08/cave-painters-didnt-dream-up-spotted-horses-study-shows/ |archivedate=2011-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/science/spotted-horses-in-cave-art-werent-just-a-figment-dna-shows.html|title=Spotted Horses in Cave Art Weren’t Just a Figment, DNA Shows|date=8 November 2011|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of [[DNA]] in horse fossils of similar date to the paintings show the presence of the [[Leopard complex]] gene, which could result in the coat patterns shown in the caves.&lt;ref name="pnas"&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/11/02/1108982108.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-11-ancient-dna-insights-cave-horses.html|title=Ancient DNA provides new insights into cave paintings of horses|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Cave paintings===
[[File:Pech Merle cave leopard spotting.JPG|thumb|Pech Merle cave horses with leopard spotting]]
Ancient cave paintings began emerging roughly 35,000 years ago and are found often in remote locations around the world. According to various carbon dating tests, roughly 25,000 years ago, a cave painting depicting spotted horses was painted in [[Pech Merle]] cave in France. European cave paintings often depict rhinoceros, wild cattle and other types of game, but the spotted horses depicted seem to indicate that the species existed 20,000 years prior to their domestication, some 5,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bikyamasr.com/47944/new-studies-indicate-spotted-horses-have-existed-for-35000-years/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109214951/http://bikyamasr.com/47944/new-studies-indicate-spotted-horses-have-existed-for-35000-years/ |archivedate=2012-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Leopard Complex===

The coat patterns in horses are genetically-related and are called a [[leopard complex]]. The genes in leopard complex are also linked to abnormalities in the eyes and vision. These patterns are most closely identified with the [[Appaloosa]] horse breed, though its presence in breeds from Asia to western Europe has indicated that it is due to a very ancient mutation.

===Evidence===
Until now, scientists only had DNA evidence of monochrome horses - mainly bay and black - living in Europe in that period, and had therefore assumed that the spots had a shamanistic or spiritual significance – or were simply the artistic license of an imaginative caveman. With past research of ancient DNA only turning up evidence of brown and black horses as seen painted in the Lascaux Cave and Chauvet Cave, scientists wondered if the spotted horses seen in other caves such as Pech Merle, with it paintings of white horses with black spots, were real or fantasy,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cavingnews.com/20111108-new-study-confirms-early-cave-painters-were-realists-lascaux-chauvet-pech-merle|title=New Study Confirms Early Cave Painters were Realists|work=Caving News}}&lt;/ref&gt; New DNA evidence gathered and analyzed by an international team of researchers has found that spotted horses did indeed exist in Europe in what is known as the Upper Paleolithic period, 50,000 to 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="dw-world"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15517588,00.html|title=Pech Merle horses really were spotted, scientists say|work=DW.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discoveries==
===The Dappled Horses of Pech Merle===
The approximately 25,000-year-old paintings "The Dappled Horses of [[Pech Merle]]" depict spotted horses on the walls of a [[cave]] in [[France]] remarkably similar to a pattern known as "[[leopard]]" in modern horses such as [[Appaloosas]]. [[Horses]] were popular among [[Stone Age]] artists, found in most [[cave paintings]] that have recognizable animals in them, commonly in a [[caricature]] form that slightly exaggerates the most typical "horsey" features, such as their manes of hair.

Until now, ancient [[DNA analyses]] suggested horses during the Stone Age were only black or bay colored with no evidence for white-spotted patterns. This hinted that cave paintings of leopard-patterned horses were fantasy, not accurate portrayals. Some have proposed that drawings of imaginary animals might have had some kind of symbolic or even religious value.

Research now suggests those paintings might actually have been based on the real-life appearance of the animals.

Scientists investigated the differences in [[genes]] for coat color of 31 ancient horse [[fossils]] from [[Siberia]], Eastern and Western [[Europe]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The researchers found that a [[genetic mutation]] associated with the presence of white leopard-like spotting patterns on modern horses was present in six of the European horse fossils. Additionally, seven of the fossils had the [[genetic variation]] for black coat color, whereas 18 had bay coats.

All horse color phenotypes that seem to be distinguishable in cave paintings have now been found to exist in prehistoric horse populations, suggesting that cave paintings of this species represent remarkably realistic depictions of the animals shown. This finding lends support to hypotheses arguing that cave paintings might have contained less of a symbolic or transcendental connotation than often assumed.&lt;ref name="pnas"/&gt; Still, although these horses might not have been imaginary but cannot be excluded that the paintings had not have any religious value.&lt;ref name="dw-world"/&gt;

==Future research==
Leopard-spotted patterns in modern horses are sometimes linked with [[congenital]] problems such as stationary [[night blindness]], perhaps explaining why any [[wild horse]]s with them eventually died out long ago. As to why so many other horse fossils were found with them in the first place, perhaps this patterning provided [[camouflage]] in the snowy environments of the [[Stone Age]], was attractive to mates or just stuck around due to random chance.

It is difficult to judge how common the spotted horses were, based on the handful of samples tested, but there may be evidence that they were "not rare." This is also a new insight, since many researchers had considered a spotted coat unlikely for Paleolithic horses. The ability to genotype Stone Age animals is a relatively new tool for archeologists, and it is possible to gain more knowledge about the appearance of these animals.&lt;ref name="dw-world"/&gt;

==''Star Wars'' (2014–present)==
Since 2014, the official ''Star Wars'' canon includes all the movie episodes, [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''The Clone Wars'' film]] and the television shows ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', as well as any books, comics, and video games published after April 2014.

''Star Wars Legends'' works were previously organized around an in-universe timeline based on the [[Battle of Yavin]] from the original 1977 ''Star Wars'', referencing years Before the Battle of Yavin (BBY) or After the Battle of Yavin (ABY).

The Madaba Map is a map of the Middle East. Part of it contains the oldest surviving original [[cartography|cartographic]] depiction of the [[Holy Land]] and especially [[Jerusalem]]. It dates to the 6th century AD.

==History==
[[File:Madaba Map reproduction.jpg|thumb|250px|Reproduction of the Madaba Map]]
The Madaba Mosaic Map depicts Jerusalem with the [[Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos|Nea Church]], which was dedicated on 20 November, AD 542. Buildings erected in Jerusalem after 570 are absent from the depiction, thus limiting the date range of its creation to the period between 542 and 570.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The mosaic was made by unknown artists, probably for the [[Christianity|Christian]] community of Madaba, which was the seat of a [[bishop]] at that time. In 614, Madaba was conquered by the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian empire]]. In the 8th century AD, the [[Islam|Muslim]] [[Umayyad]] rulers had some figural motifs removed from the mosaic. In 746, Madaba was largely destroyed by an earthquake and subsequently abandoned. The mosaic was rediscovered in 1884, during the construction of a new [[Greek Orthodox]] church on the site of its ancient predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meimaris|first=Yiannis|title=The Discovery of the Madaba Mosaic Map.

A Franciscan friar of ltalian-Croatian origin born in Constantinople, Fr. Girolamo Golubovich, helped Abuna Kleofas to print a booklet in Greek about the map at the Franciscan printing press of Jerusalem. Immediately afterwards, the Revue Biblique published a long and detailed historic-geographic study of the map by the Dominican fathers M.J. Lagrange and H. Vincent after visiting the site themselves. At the same time. Father J. Germer-Durand of the Assumptionist Fathers published a photographic album with his own pictures of the map. In Paris, C. Clermont-Gannau, a well known oriental scholar, announced the discovery at the Academie des Sciences et belles Lettres. "&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following decades, large portions of the mosaic map were damaged by fires, activities in the new church and by the effects of moisture. In December 1964, the [[Volkswagen]] Foundation gave the ''Deutscher Verein für die Erforschung Palästinas'' ("German Society for the exploration of Palestine") 90,000 [[Deutschmark|DM]] to save the mosaic. In 1965, the archaeologists Heinz Cüppers and Herbert Donner undertook the restoration and conservation of the remaining parts of the mosaic.

==Description==
[[File:Sapsaphas Madaba.jpg|thumb|Place of [[John the Baptist]]'s baptism at the mouth of the [[Jordan (river)|Jordan]] and (near-obliterated) lion hunting a gazelle]]
The floor mosaic is located in the [[apse]] of the church of Saint George at Madaba. It is not oriented northwards, like modern maps, but faces east towards the [[altar]] in such a fashion that the position of places on the map coincides with the actual compass directions. Originally, it measured 21 by 7 m and contained over two million ''[[tesserae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-bonn.de/Aktuelles/Publikationen/forsch/forsch_4_November_2005/bilder/Kultur.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Ute Friederich: ''Antike Kartographie''&lt;/ref&gt; Its current dimensions are 16 by 5 m.

===Topographic representation===
The mosaic map depicts an area from [[Lebanon]] in the north to the [[Nile Delta]] in the south, and from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the west to the [[Eastern Desert]]. Among other features, it depicts the [[Dead Sea]] with two fishing boats, a variety of bridges linking the banks of the [[Jordan (river)|Jordan]], fish swimming in the river and receding from the Dead Sea; a [[lion]] (rendered nearly unrecognisable by the insertion of random tesserae during a period of [[iconoclasm]]) hunting a [[gazelle]] in the [[Moab]] desert, [[palmtree|palm]]-ringed [[Jericho]], [[Bethlehem]] and other [[bible|biblical]]-Christian sites. The map may partially have served to facilitate pilgrims' orientation in the Holy Land.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} All landscape units are labelled with explanations in [[Greek language|Greek]]. A combination of folding perspective and aerial view depicts about 150 towns and villages, all of them labelled.

The largest and most detailed element of the topographic depiction is Jerusalem, at the centre of the map. The mosaic clearly shows a number of significant structures in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]]: the [[Damascus Gate]], the [[Lions' Gate]], the [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|Golden Gate]], the [[Zion Gate]], the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], the [[Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos|New Church of the Theotokos]], the [[Tower of David]] and the [[Cardo#Jerusalem|''Cardo Maximus'']]. The recognisable depiction of the urban topography makes the mosaic a key source on Byzantine Jerusalem. Also unique are the detailed depictions of cities such as [[Nablus#Flavia Neapolis|Neapolis]], [[Askalon]], [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Pelusium]] and [[Kerak|Charachmoba]], all of them nearly detailed enough to be described as [[street map]]s.

==Scientific significance==
The mosaic map of Madaba is the oldest known geographic floor mosaic in [[art history]]. It is used heavily for the localisation and verification of biblical sites. Study of the map played a major role in answering the question of the topographical location of [[Askalon]] (''Asqalan'' on the map).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grin.com/de/preview/59736.html Jana Vogt: ''Architekturmosaiken am Beispiel der drei jordanischen Städte Madaba, Umm al-Rasas und Gerasa''. Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universität Greifswald, Greifswald 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1967, excavations in the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]] of Jerusalem revealed the Nea Church and the ''Cardo Maximus'' in the very locations suggested by the Madaba Map.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111021010325/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Early%20History%20-%20Archaeology/Jerusalem-%20the%20Nea%20Church%20and%20the%20Cardo ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES NO. 5 Jerusalem- the Nea Church and the Cardo]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, excavations further substantiated its accuracy with the discovery of a road depicted in the map that runs through the center of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/02/10/jerusalem.road.discovery/index.html?hpt=T2 | work=CNN | title=Archaeologists find Byzantine era road | date=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the map, the main entrance to the city was through a large gate opening into a wide central street. Until the discovery, archaeologists were not able to excavate this site due to heavy pedestrian traffic. In the wake of infrastructure work near the [[Jaffa Gate]], large paving stones were discovered at a depth of 4 meters below ground that prove such a road existed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1149033.html Dig uncovers ancient Jerusalem street depicted on Byzantine map ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copies of the Madaba Map==
A copy of the map is in the collection of the Archaeological Institute at [[Göttingen University]]. It was produced during the conservation work at Madaba in 1965 by archaeologists of the [[Rheinisches Landesmuseum Trier|Rheinisches Landesmuseum]], [[Trier]]. A copy produced by students of the ''Madaba Mosaic School'' is in the foyer of the [[Akademisches Kunstmuseum]] at [[Bonn]]. The lobby of the [[YMCA]] in Jerusalem has a replica of the map incorporated in the floor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Archaeology/jermandate.html Jerusalem: Architecture in the British Mandate Period]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5824">{{for|academic procrastination|Student syndrome}}
'''Medical students' disease''' (also known as '''second year syndrome''' or '''intern's syndrome''') is a condition frequently reported in [[medical student]]s, who perceive themselves to be experiencing the symptoms of a disease that they are studying. 

The condition is associated with the fear of contracting the disease in question. Some authors suggested that the condition must be referred to as [[nosophobia]]&lt;ref name=hunter&gt;Hunter R.C.A, Lohrenz J.G., Schwartzman A.E. "Nosophobia and hypochondriasis in medical students". J Nerv Ment Dis 1964;130:147-52. {{PMID|14206454}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thakur-preunca&gt;Nikhil Thakur, Bogdan Preunca "Nosophobia presented as acute hypochondria". TMJ 56(2), 120&lt;/ref&gt; rather than "hypochondriasis", because the quoted studies show a very low percentage of [[hypochondria]]cal character of the condition, and hence the term "hypochondriasis" would have ominous therapeutic and prognostic indications. The reference&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt; suggests that the condition is associated with immediate preoccupation with the symptoms in question, leading the student to become unduly aware of various casual psychological and physiological dysfunctions; cases show little correlation with the severity of [[psychopathology]], but rather with accidental factors related to learning and experience.

==Overview==
Baars (2001) writes that medical students who study "frightening diseases" for the first time routinely experience vivid delusions of having contracted such diseases, and describes it as a "temporary kind of hypochondria". Baars says that the experience is so common that it has become known as "medical student syndrome".

Hodges (2004), reviewing the literature, said that "the first descriptions of medical students' disease appeared in the 1960s." He may have been referring to the phrase, for the phenomenon itself was noted much earlier. George Lincoln Walton (1908) reported that

:Medical instructors are continually consulted by students who fear that they have the diseases they are studying. The knowledge that pneumonia produces pain in a certain spot leads to a concentration of attention upon that region which causes any sensation there to give alarm. The mere knowledge of the location of the appendix transforms the most harmless sensations in that region into symptoms of serious menace.

Hodges also said that it was suggested in the 1960s that:
:This phenomenon caused a significant amount of stress for students and was present in approximately 70 to 80 percent of students... papers written in the 1980s and 1990s conceptualised the condition as an illness in the psychiatric spectrum of hypochondriasis.... Marcus found that the dream content of year two medical students frequently involved a preoccupation with personal illness. Marcus's subjects reported many dreams in which they suffered illnesses of the heart, the eyes and the bowels, among others.

Hodges went on to describe work by Moss-Morris and Pétrie who saw medical students' disease as "a normal perceptual process, rather than a form of hypochondriasis." Learning about a disease "creates a mental schema or representation of the illness which includes the label of the illness and the symptoms associated with the condition. Once this representation is formed, symptoms or bodily sensations that the individual is currently experiencing which are consistent with the schema may be noticed, while inconsistent symptoms are ignored."

Howes and Salkovskis (1998) noted that "medical students frequently develop fears and symptoms of illness. This has been termed medical student's disease, nosophobia, hypochondriasis of medical students, and medicalstudentitis." They mentioned two studies, one concluding that about 70% of medical students have groundless medical fears during their studies, and one which found that 78.8% of a randomly chosen sample of medical students showed a history of "medical student disease." However, they cite a number of studies showing a similar incidence of hypochondria in law students and other non-medical students, which they said call into question "the widely held view that medical students are more likely than others to have excessive anxiety about their health."

==In popular culture==
An episode of the TV show ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' called ''Our Driving Issues'' features a class of medical students who, despite having been warned about medical students' disease, nevertheless suffer from it.

In the Tamil Blockbuster Dharmadhurai one of the leads suffer from second year syndrome.

Set in a [[Retrofuturism|retro-futuristic]] 31st century, the series follows the adventures of the employees of Planet Express, an interplanetary delivery company. In this episode, [[Mom's Friendly Robot Company]] introduces a new model of robot, so older models, including [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]], are required to get a system upgrade.

==Plot==
At a robot expo, Mom's Friendly Robot Company introduces a new robot: Robot 1-X. [[Professor Hubert Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] buys one to help out around the office. Feeling obsolete after witnessing 1-X outperform him at every assigned task, [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] decides to get an upgrade so he can be compatible with Robot 1-X. After witnessing another robot display a complete personality change after receiving the upgrade, Bender begins to have second thoughts, and mid-upgrade he changes his mind and leaps out the window.

Too scared to get the upgrade but unable to face the others without it, he heads out to sea, only to wash up on an uncharted island. Bender finds four outdated robots living on the island and befriends them. The outdated robots gradually convert Bender to their rejection of technology, and he orders them to "downgrade" his metal robotics to a wooden body. Bender leads his friends to New New York, where they wage war on technology. The band of five destroy most technology in the city, including Mom's factory, and head to Planet Express to destroy Robot 1-X.

After destroying the power lines, Bender breaks into the hangar, where he confronts his former crew. Bender has his robotic friends throw boulders at Robot 1-X, but they miss and hit the Planet Express ship, which falls and pins the crew down to the floor. A candle falls onto the leaking fuel from the ship, forming a ring of fire around the crew. Bender tries to use the extinguisher, but his wooden body collapses from [[termite]] damage and catches fire. Bender resorts to asking Robot 1-X to save the crew. Once 1-X saves them, Bender is overcome with feelings of gratitude and friendship for 1-X.

It is then revealed that Bender never actually left the upgrade factory, and his adventure was a vision his brain used to express the alteration of his feelings towards 1-X.

== Production ==
A scene during the robot upgrade was cut featuring Mom brainwashing the robots. There was also an extra scene at the convention cut.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite video | people=Cohen, David X.|date=2003|title=Futurama season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Obsoletely Fabulous"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular voice actor [[John DiMaggio]] did Bender's dialogue in the scene where he dances to [[I'm Alright (Kenny Loggins song)|"I'm Alright"]] by [[Kenny Loggins]] before the crew had the song available.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; The music for the scene when the obsolete robots rampage the city was written by [[Christopher Tyng]] and not licensed.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; The sound effect for Bender's arms falling off was meant to be temporary but it was kept because it was funnier than any of the later attempts at the sounds.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2208">The '''''opus gallicum''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "Gallic work") was a technique of construction whereby precise holes were created in stone masonry for the insertion of wooden beams to create a wooden infrastructure. The technique was so named because, though its presence is attested in protohistoric times, its use was common enough in [[Gaul]] to merit mention in [[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar's]] ''[[De Bello Gallico|De bello Gallico]]'' and was frequently employed in the [[Merovingian]] era. The technique was imported by the [[Normans]] into the [[Molise]], where it was used extensively in the raising of [[castle]]s in a short time. Gaulish masons are even known to have brought the technique from Merovingian Francia to [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[England]] during the 7th and 8th centuries and employed it in [[church architecture]]. 

The ''opus gallicum'' served not only as an infrastructural base, but also a [[Superstructure|superstructural]] binding element designed to strengthen the masonry. While the arrangement of some of the holes found in preserved structures is often perplexing, leaving doubt as to the exact function of the beams, modern scholarship has largely moved away from the theory that the ''opus gallicum'' was a rare and inefficient method. Overall the technique was not uncommon in the Middle Ages.

==Oxford University Innovation's divisions==
Oxford University Innovation is split into three divisions, dedicated to different areas of knowledge transfer. Alongside the central Technology Transfer group that deals exclusively with disclosures and patent applications from University of Oxford researchers, Oxford University Innovation manages:

'''Oxford University Consulting''' (OUC); which arranges consultancy services providing third-party clients access to expertise from the University’s academics to enhance innovative capability and to manage the contractual and administrative aspects of consultancy, minimising the administrative burden while protecting personal interests of the academic and those of the University. Areas of expertise include (but are not limited to) problem solving, data analysis, expert evaluation, due diligence, management and business development. OUC also helps Oxford University departments in hiring out specialist services and facilities to private companies by managing the contractual and financial aspects on behalf of the departments. OUC’s activities meet the [[ISO 9000|ISO 9001]] quality assurance standard.

'''Isis Enterprise'''; established as a separate business division in 2004, Isis Enterprise offers consulting expertise, training and advice in technology transfer based upon Oxford University Innovation’s success as the University of Oxford’s technology transfer company. Isis Enterprise works with other universities, research organisations and governments around the world to develop their technology transfer activities, as well as helping private businesses improve research &amp; development processes and technology scouting. In 2009 Isis Enterprise set up an office in Hong Kong to facilitate the growth of academic and governmental technology transfer activity in the [[Asia Pacific]] region.

== Other activities ==
The '''Oxford Innovation Society''' (OIS), founded in 1990, is a forum for [[Open Innovation]], bringing together researchers and inventors, Oxford spin-outs, technology transfer professionals, local companies, venture capital groups and some of the world's most innovative multinationals. The society allows companies to have a “window” on Oxford science and fosters links between business and the academic community. Members receive an advance notification of all patent applications marketed by Oxford University Innovation, invitations to networking opportunities at formal OIS dinners, customised research presentations and bespoke seminars for technology roadmapping and strategic planning.

The '''Isis Angels Network''' (IAN) introduces private investors and seed/venture capitalists interested in investing in spin-out companies from the University of Oxford to investment opportunities. IAN is a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee, established by the then Isis in 1999.

Oxford University Innovation also administers the Oxford '''University Challenge Seed Fund''' (UCSF), which was launched in 1999 with investment from the UK Treasury, Wellcome Trust and Gatsby Foundation. The £4&amp;nbsp;million Oxford UCSF has invested in over 100 projects, ranging in size from £1,700 to £250,000. The overall objective of the UCSF scheme is to enable universities to access seed funds in order to assist the successful transformation of good research into good business.

In 2010, Oxford University Innovation (then Isis Innovation) – in conjunction with the University’s ‘Oxford Thinking’ campaign – created the '''Oxford Invention Fund''' (OIF). The open fund allows anyone to donate money which goes towards helping create prototypes or proof-of-concept models from ideas and technologies developed at Oxford to improve the transfer into a commercial setting.&lt;ref name="Isis2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Invention Fund Report and Update 2014|url=https://innovation.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/OIF-brochure_2014_final.pdf|website=Isis Innovation|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxford University Innovation manages the licensing of copyrighted [[Patient Reported Outcome]]s (PROs) questionnaires via its '''Isis Outcomes''' brand. These questionnaires,  developed within the University, are used for academic and commercial clinical studies into a variety of illnesses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isis Outcomes Launches New Site|url=https://innovation.ox.ac.uk/news/isis-outcomes-launches-new-site/|accessdate=24 May 2018|website=Oxford University Innovation|publisher=University of Oxford|date=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Parkinson’s Disease]]&lt;ref name="Parkinsons"&gt;{{cite web|title=PDQ-39 Questionnaire|url=https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/research/health-services-research-unit-hsru/outcome-measures/pdq-39-questionnaire|website=Nuffield Department of Population Health|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Endometriosis]]. The negotiation of sales agreements for biological and physical science materials such as cell lines and antibodies are also handled by Isis Innovation.

Since 2010, Oxford University Innovation has run the '''Isis Startup Incubator''' (ISI), designed to support very early-stage software ventures from students, staff and alumni of the University of Oxford; the Incubator offers physical space and IT facilities as well as commercial mentoring, funding support and business networking facilitation.

Oxford University Innovation has strong links with all the parts of the University involved in technology commercialisation and enterprise. These include: 
*Research Services
*[[Begbroke Science Park]]
*Oxford Science Enterprise Centre
*Entrepreneurship Said, at the [[Saïd Business School]]. 

[[Oxford University|Oxford Spin-out Equity Management]] (OSEM) was created in 2008 and works closely with Oxford University Innovation and the University of Oxford’s Finance Division to manage the University’s shareholdings in its spin-out companies and optimising returns on University investments.

[[File:Seurat-La Parade detail.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail from [[Georges Seurat|Seurat]]'s ''[[Parade de cirque]]'', 1889, showing the contrasting dots of paint which define Pointillism]]
'''Pointillism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɔɪ|n|t|ᵻ|l|ɪ|z|əm}}) is a technique of [[painting]] in which small, distinct dots of color are applied in patterns to form an image.

[[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac]] developed the technique in 1886, branching from [[Impressionism]].  The term "Pointillism" was coined by [[art critics]] in the late 1880s to ridicule the works of these artists, and is now used without its earlier mocking connotation.&lt;ref name=artcyclopedia /&gt; The movement Seurat began with this technique is known as [[Neo-impressionism]]. The [[Divisionism|Divisionists]], too, used a similar technique of patterns to form images, though with larger cube-like brushstrokes.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhrberg, Karl. "Seurat and the Neo-Impressionists". ''Art of the 20th Century'', Vol. 2. Koln: Benedikt Taschen Verlag, 1998. {{ISBN|3-8228-4089-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==
The technique relies on the ability of the eye and mind of the viewer to blend the color spots into a fuller range of tones. It is related to [[Divisionism]], a more technical variant of the method. Divisionism is concerned with color theory, whereas pointillism is more focused on the specific style of brushwork used to apply the paint.&lt;ref name=artcyclopedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/history/pointillism.html|title=Pointillism|website=www.artcyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a technique with few serious practitioners today, and is notably seen in the works of [[Georges Seurat|Seurat]], [[Paul Signac|Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross|Cross]]. However, see also [[Andy Warhol]]'s early works, and [[Pop Art]].

[[File:Paul Signac Femmes au puits 1892détailcouleur.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Signac]], ''Femmes au Puits'', 1892, showing a detail with constituent colors. [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris]]
[[File:Henri-Edmond Cross - The Evening Air - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Henri-Edmond Cross]], ''L'air du soir'', c.1893, [[Musée d'Orsay]]]]

== Practice ==

The practice of Pointillism is in sharp contrast to the traditional methods of blending pigments on a [[Palette (painting)|palette]]. Pointillism is analogous to the four-color [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] printing process used by some color printers and large presses that place dots of Cyan (blue), Magenta (red), Yellow, and Key (black). Televisions and computer monitors use a similar technique to represent image colors using [[RGB color model|Red, Green, and Blue]] (RGB) colors.&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;Vivien Greene, ''Divisionism, Neo-Impressionism: Arcadia &amp; Anarchy'', Guggenheim Museum Publications, 2007, {{ISBN|0-89207-357-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If red, blue, and green light (the [[Primary color#Additive primaries|additive primaries]]) are mixed, the result is something close to white light (see [[Prism (optics)]]). Painting is inherently [[Primary color#Additive primaries|subtractive]], but Pointillist colors often seem brighter than typical mixed subtractive colors. This may be partly because subtractive mixing of the pigments is avoided, and partly because some of the white canvas may be showing between the applied dots.&lt;ref name="Greene" /&gt;

The painting technique used for Pointillist color mixing is at the expense of the traditional brushwork used to delineate [[Texture (painting)|texture]].&lt;ref name="Greene" /&gt;

The majority of Pointillism is done in oil paint. Anything may be used in its place, but oils are preferred for their thickness and tendency not to run or bleed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.si.umich.edu/chico/emerson/pntmat.html|title=Nathan, Solon.

== Music ==

Pointillism also refers to a style of 20th-century music composition. Different musical notes are made in seclusion, rather than in a linear sequence, giving a sound texture similar to the painting version of Pointillism. This type of music is also known as [[punctualism]] or [[klangfarbenmelodie]].

The word ''pond'' is [[Afrikaans]] for the word "[[Pound (currency)|pound]]". In fact, the [[South African pound]] banknotes of the [[South African Reserve Bank]] have the word "Pond" inscribed, as do the banknotes of South West Africa that were issued between the 1930s and 1959.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7097">'''Precision teaching''' is a precise and systematic method of evaluating instructional tactics and curricula.  It is one of the few quantitative analyses of behavior forms of applied behavior analysis.  It comes from a very strong quantitative scientific basis and was pioneered by [[Ogden Lindsley]] in the 1960s based largely on [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]]'s [[operant conditioning]]. Precision teaching is a type of [[programmed instruction]] that focuses heavily on frequency as its main datum.  By focusing on fluency, the teacher can then adjust the curricula for each learner to maximize the learning based on the learner's personal fluency measurements. The instruction can be by any method or approach. For example, the most effective applications of precision teaching have been when it is combined with [[direct instruction]].&lt;ref name=Lins1991&gt;{{cite journal | title = Precision Teaching's Unique Legacy from B. F. Skinner | journal = Journal of Behavioral Education | year = 1991 | first = Ogden R.  | last = Lindsley | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 253–266| id =   | url = http://www.fluency.org/lindsley1991.pdf | accessdate = 2012-02-28 | doi=10.1007/bf00957007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children as young as five have charted their fluency measurements and utilized precision teaching to increase their learning.   According to Owen White,&lt;ref name=white86&gt;White, O. R. (1986). Precision teaching—Precision learning. Exceptional Children, 52, 522-534.&lt;/ref&gt; Precision teaching "has been used successfully to teach the progress of learners ranging from the severely disabled to university graduate students, from the very young to the very old".

==Guiding principles==
*'''Focus on Directly Observable Behavior'''
:By focusing on directly observable behavior, teachers can avoid ambiguity.  Thus, it is important for the teacher to measure concrete, directly observable behaviors which can be counted and recorded.  Even if the learning deficit is a subtle or private one (such as reading silently), the teacher must find a way to make it public so that it may be counted and improved.&lt;ref name="white86"/&gt;
*'''Frequency as a Measure of Performance'''
:Frequency is specified as counts per minute.  There are well researched advantages to the use of frequency data over traditional measures in education such as percent correct &lt;ref name=Lins1991 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Binder, C. (1996). Behavioral fluency: Evolution of a new paradigm. The Behavior Analyst, 19, 163-197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, R. P., &amp; Young, K. R. (1992). Precision teaching. In R. P. West &amp; L. A. Hamerlynck (Eds.), Designs for excellence in education: The legacy of B. F. Skinner (pp. 113-146). Longmont, CO: Sopris West, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Standard Celeration Chart '''
:Ogden Lindsley created the standard celeration chart because of a large amount of differences between the way each teacher was charting their learner's behavior at the University of Kansas Children's Rehabilitation unit.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsley, O. R. (1990b). Precision teaching: By teachers for children. [[Teaching Exceptional Children]], 22(3), 10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lindsley indicated that it took 20 to 30 minutes to share one project because each chart had to be explained and described.  Thus, the standard celeration chart was developed in which the x-axis is an add scale to accommodate a full school semester (140 days).  The y-axis was on a multiply scale accommodating frequencies ranging from 1 per day to 1000 per minute.  The largest benefit was that with the new chart, different students being charted by different teachers will still have pictures of progress which can be compared and evaluated.&lt;ref name=white86 /&gt;
*'''The Learner Knows Best'''
:Ogden Lindsley explains how he coined this slogan:
{{Quotation|"When I was a graduate student, I trained a rat whose behavior did not extinguish exactly as the charts in Skinner's book had shown. My rat at first had responded much more rapidly when his responding was no longer reinforced. The rapid responding went on for about 30 minutes, at which time the rat stopped abruptly. I took the cumulative record of the rat's unusual extinction to Dr. Skinner and asked him how this had happened. How could the rat do this when the book showed a very different gradual extinction curve? Skinner answered, "In this case, the book is wrong! The rat knows best! That's why we still have him in the experiment!"|Ogden Lindsley| Precision teaching: By teachers for children. Teaching Exceptional Children, 22(3) page 12}}
:From this experience, Ogden realized that if a student is progressing according to plan, the program is good for the student.  If not, the program is flawed, and needs to be changed, therefore, there is no failure by the student as a product of the student&lt;ref&gt;Fan-Yu Lin and Kubina R.M. (2004) Learning Channels and Verbal Behavior, ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 5 (1),'' 1-14 {{cite web |url=http://www.baojournal.com/BAT%20Journal/VOL-5/BAT-5-1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030031931/http://www.baojournal.com/BAT%20Journal/VOL-5/BAT-5-1.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-30 |df= }} ,&lt;/ref&gt; but rather as a product of the teaching.

==Instructional tools==
*'''Standard Celeration Chart''':
:To measure fluency, precision teaching utilizes a semi-logarithmic chart called a [[Standard Celeration Chart]].  This chart allows for demonstration of changes in rate of acquisition and allows the teacher to quickly assess a student’s performance accelerating through time.&lt;ref name=Lins1991 /&gt; By utilizing this chart, teachers are able to quickly adjust the curriculum to maximize the student's performance and learning. This chart was developed by Lindsley in the 1950s while at Metropolitan State Hospital and Harvard University.  It was not created in its current form until 1967.

*'''SAFMEDS''':
:SAFMEDS is a method of training to fluency and stands for Say All Facts a Minute Every Day Shuffled. This training has been shown to increase performance in college settings.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. (2000). Behavioral approaches to college teaching. In J. Austin and J. E. Carr (Eds.) Handbook of applied behavior analysis (p. 449-472). Reno, NV.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1454">'''Preferentialism''' is a [[philosophical movement]] which began in [[Paris]] in the early 1990s.   In direct opposition to the relativism of [[Existentialism]], Preferentialism stresses [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and [[natural law]] principles, applying the latter to [[epistemology]] as well as to [[morality]] and [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Mamas, D. L., Phys. Essays 27, 515 (2014) http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PhyEs..27..515M&lt;/ref&gt;  Preferentialism states that there are certain absolute ''preferential'' frames of reference which are preferred by nature, in opposition to the [[individualism|individualistic]] relativism of Existentialism.&lt;ref&gt;Mamas, D. L., Phys. Essays 27, 515 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Preferentialism is a general philosophical concept whereby it is the decisive criterion of nature which imposes preferential bases of reference in all major areas of philosophy.

Preferentialism has application in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Rønnow-Rasmussen, T., Personal Value. Oxford: Oxford University Press (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Ronnow-Rasmussen, T., http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lup/publication/793456 &lt;/ref&gt;

A comparison of  Preferentialism  vis-à-vis  Existentialism  is  analyzed  in  the  philosophy  journal  ''Hildegarde''&lt;ref&gt;Popieul, A., ''Hildegarde'' 5, 11-18 (2016) https://issuu.com/hildegardefanzine/docs/hildegarde_novembre_16_1.8 &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1881">A '''proverbial phrase''' or a '''proverbial expression''' is type of a conventional [[saying]] similar to [[proverb]]s and transmitted by oral tradition. The difference is that a proverb is a fixed [[Expression (language)|expression]], while a proverbial phrase permits alterations to fit the grammar of the context.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1497581 "Proverbial Phrases from California"], by Owen S.

Another similar construction is an [[idiom]]atic phrase. Sometimes it is difficult to draw a distinction between idiomatic phrase and proverbial expression. In both of them the meaning does not immediately follow from the phrase. The difference is that an idiomatic phrase involves [[figurative language]] in its components, while in a proverbial phrase the figurative meaning is the extension of its [[literal meaning]]. Some experts  classify proverbs and proverbial phrases as types of [[idiom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lexicography: Critical Concepts (2003) R. R. K.

[[File:Mountie-on-Parliament-Hill.jpg|thumb|RCMP wearing the Red Serge while on duty at [[Parliament Hill, Ottawa]]]]
{{for|the 1980s television series|Red Serge (TV series)}}
The '''Red Serge''' refers to the jacket of the [[dress uniform]] of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]. It consists of a scarlet [[Red coat (British Army and Royal Marines)|British-style military pattern tunic]], complete with a high-neck collar and blue breeches with yellow stripe identifying a cavalry history.

== Constables and non-commissioned officers ==
Constables (Cst) and non-commissioned officers (NCOs) wear the red serge tunic with blue gorget patches on their collars and [[epaulette]]s of navy blue. Metal collar dogs of the RCMP badge are worn on the neck. Constables and NCOs wear embroidered firearms qualification badges on the bottom of their left sleeve, and their embroidered specialist trade badge on the right sleeve. If a second specialist badge is earned, the least current is worn below the firearms qualification badges.  Embroidered NCO rank badges of  corporal (Cpl), and sergeant (Sgt) are worn on the right sleeve below the specialist trade badge (if any). Staff sergeant (S/Sgt), sergeant major (S/Maj), and staff sergeant major (S/S/Maj) are worn on the bottom of the right sleeve. With RCMP badges, no badge is worn directly above a badge containing a crown. Service stars, each designating 5 years of service, are worn on the left sleeve.  

In "review order," the riding breeches ([[jodhpurs]]) are "midnight blue" (virtually black) which bulge at the thigh in keeping with traditional cut with a yellow strapping (stripe) down the outside seam of each leg, and laced closed beneath the boots. The breeches are worn with [[suspenders|braces]]. Finishing off the Red Serge are brown leather [[riding boot]]s, known as high browns or Strathcona boots, with spurs, and a brown wide-brimmed felt [[campaign hat]] with a glass-flat brim.  The ever-present side-arm, currently either a [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 5906|Smith &amp; Wesson model 5946]] or 3953, is carried in a brown leather holster on a brown [[Sam Browne belt]]. There is a brown leather pouch for carrying handcuffs and another for two spare pistol magazines. The Cst, Cpl, Sgt, and S/Sgt Sam Browne cross strap travels over the left shoulder.  A S/Maj may have a whistle and chain on the cross strap.  A white pistol [[lanyard]] is worn around the neck and connected to the side arm.  "Review order" may be worn with "full" Sam Browne, or "stripped" Sam Browne where no lanyard, pistol, holster, or pouches are worn.  Female RCMP members formerly wore a modified version of the Red Serge for review order without the high collar but now wear the same pattern of tunic as their male colleagues.

"Walking-out order" is worn for more formal occasions.  Walking-out order consists of the red serge tunic, a blue and gold waist belt with brass buckle, stirrup overalls, pants known in RCMP slang as "banana pants", with [[congress boot]]s and spurs.

Female RCMP members wear the same tunic and waist belt as their male counterparts, as well as a long skirt {{cn|date=June 2017}} and black shoes.

== Commissioned officers ==
Junior commissioned officers (inspectors and above) wear similar red serge tunics; however, their collars are solid blue as are their sleeve cuffs. Officers do not wear any qualification, specialist, or service badges on their tunics.  Rank is worn in the British style of metal "pips" and "crowns" on the epaulettes.  The yellow stripe on officers' breeches and males' overalls is finer material and wider than Cst and NCOs.  Officers' "high brown" boots are different from the Cst and NCOs. Officers' [[Sam Browne belt|Sam Brownes]] have D-rings for sword frogs, and the cross straps travel over the right shoulder.

Senior officers wear a metallic belt—not a leather Sam Browne—and gold-plated shoulder cords in full dress. 

Officers have the option of wearing a campaign hat or forage cap with Red Serge.  

The [[mess dress]] worn by commissioned officers has a scarlet cutaway jacket.

Prior to 1904, a white, topi-style of [[pith helmet]] was standard issue; however, plainsmen often preferred to ride wearing non-regulation cowboy hats and these subsequently became uniform issue in the form of the campaign hat. 

An RCMP officer wearing the Red Serge is an internationally recognized [[Canada|Canadian]] icon.  

The Red Serge is not worn as working dress when an officer is on normal duty, but is reserved for occasions such as civic ceremonies, musical rides, ceremonial parades, as a visual representative of the security force for government dignitaries, and during public relations&amp;mdash;related special events such as school career days or guard duty at Parliament in Ottawa.  Members also march in funerals for police officers wearing the traditional Red Serge.

The Red Serge is also worn by RCMP members during special personal events, such as the wedding ceremony of a fellow officer, where it is not uncommon for an entire detachment of a small community to wear the Red Serge as an honour guard for the bride and groom at their wedding ceremony. Usually, if the groom is a member, he will be married in his Red Serge, in lieu of [[formal wear|civilian formal attire]].

==History==
The red serge was adopted as part of its standard uniform by the [[North-West Mounted Police|NWMP]] from its establishment in 1873. In its first form, it consisted of a loose-fitting "[[Norfolk jacket]]" supplied from Canadian [[Militia]] stocks. While comfortable and practical, the Norfolk jacket lacked smartness and it was replaced after 1876 by scarlet full-dress and undress tunics manufactured by British suppliers. An elaborate ceremonial tunic of hussar style was prescribed for officers but infrequently worn. Scarlet continued to be the base color for all occasions; partially to distinguish the new Canadian force from blue-clad US Army units and partially because of the significance of [[Red coat (British Army and Royal Marines)|red coats]] in the British military culture inherited from the Militia.

The NWMP Dress Regulations of 1886 provided for a simpler officers' full dress based on that of British and Canadian [[dragoon]] regiments. The 1890 regulations authorized the adoption of white patrol jackets for summer wear and brown duck (khaki) for patrol duty. The red serge was by now sufficiently well-established to serve as an icon of the NWMP, though increasingly relegated to dress and garrison wear. Photographs, however, show red serge still being worn by individual constables on field duty into the early 1900s. A dark-blue, patrol "frock tunic", of the same design as the red serge, was adopted in 1904 as alternative wear for ordinary duties. A mixture of scarlet, blue, and brown tunics were worn, according to circumstances, until after 1920 when the red serge became a dress item, with brown tunics as a standard part of the normal work uniform. This remains the practice to the present day.

==In popular culture==
{{main|Royal Canadian Mounted Police#Popular awareness of the RCMP}}
The red serge is almost always used in depictions of Mounties in popular culture, such as [[Dudley Do-Right]] or [[Rose Marie (1936 film)]].

During one of his stints in the [[World Wrestling Federation]], [[Jacques Rougeau]] wore a modified red serge outfit to play his character of "The Mountie"; however, due to protests by the RCMP, the WWF mentioned repeatedly during his matches that he was not a "true representative of the Mounties."  Eventually litigation prevented Rougeau from appearing in Canada as The Mountie and the gimmick was dropped.

In the Canadian-produced series ''[[Due South]]'', produced from 1994 to 1999, the character Constable Benton Fraser of the RCMP wears the Red Serge on a normal basis. The character is a traditionalist who firmly believes in wearing that over the blue or brown uniforms, though he is seen wearing all three in the series.

'''Restoration literature''' is the [[English literature]] written during the historical period commonly referred to as the [[The Restoration|English Restoration]] (1660&amp;ndash;1689), which corresponds to the last years of the direct [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] reign in England, Scotland, [[Wales]], and Ireland. In general, the term is used to denote roughly homogeneous styles of literature that center on a celebration of or reaction to the restored court of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. It is a literature that includes extremes, for it encompasses both ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' and the [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]]'s ''[[Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery|Sodom]]'', the high-spirited [[Sex comedy|sexual comedy]] of ''[[The Country Wife]]'' and the moral wisdom of ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''. It saw [[John Locke|Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Treatises of Government]]'', the founding of the [[Royal Society]], the experiments and holy meditations of [[Robert Boyle]], the hysterical attacks on theaters from [[Jeremy Collier]], and the pioneering of [[literary criticism]] from [[John Dryden]] and [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]]. The period witnessed news become a commodity, the [[essay]] develop into a periodical art form, and the beginnings of [[textual criticism]].

The dates for Restoration literature are  a matter of convention, and they differ markedly from [[literary genre|genre]] to genre. Thus, the "Restoration" in [[English drama|drama]] may last until 1700, while in [[English poetry|poetry]] it may last only until 1666 (see [[1666 in poetry]]) and the ''[[annus mirabilis]]''; and in prose it might end in 1688, with the increasing tensions over succession and the corresponding rise in [[journalism]] and [[magazine|periodicals]], or not until 1700, when those periodicals grew more stabilized. In general, scholars use the term "Restoration"  to denote the literature that began and flourished under Charles II, whether that literature was the laudatory [[ode]] that gained a new life with restored aristocracy, the [[eschatology|eschatological]] literature that showed an increasing despair among [[Puritan]]s, or the literature of rapid communication and trade that followed in the wake of England's mercantile empire.

==Historical context==
During the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]], England had been dominated by [[Puritan]] literature and the intermittent presence of official [[censorship]] (for example, [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'' and his later retraction of that statement). While some of the Puritan ministers of [[Oliver Cromwell]] wrote poetry that was elaborate and carnal (such as [[Andrew Marvell]]'s poem, "[[To His Coy Mistress]]"), such poetry was not published. Similarly, some of the poets who published with the Restoration produced their poetry during the Interregnum. The official break in literary culture caused by censorship and radically [[morality|moralist]] standards effectively created a gap in literary tradition. At the time of the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], poetry had been dominated by [[metaphysical poets|metaphysical poetry]] of the [[John Donne]], [[George Herbert]], and [[Richard Lovelace]] sort. Drama had developed the late [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan theatre]] traditions and had begun to mount increasingly topical and political plays (for example, the drama of [[Thomas Middleton]]). The Interregnum put a stop, or at least a [[caesura]], to these lines of influence and allowed a seemingly fresh start for all forms of literature after the Restoration.

The last years of the Interregnum were turbulent, as  were the last years of the Restoration period, and those who did not go into exile were called upon to change their religious beliefs more than once. With each religious preference came a different sort of literature, both in prose and poetry (the theatres were closed during the Interregnum). When Cromwell died and his son, [[Richard Cromwell]], threatened to become [[Lord Protector]], politicians and public figures scrambled to show themselves as allies or enemies of the new regime. Printed literature was dominated by [[ode]]s in poetry, and religious writing in prose. The industry of religious tract writing, despite official efforts, did not reduce its output. Figures such as the founder of the [[Religious Society of Friends|Society of Friends]], [[George Fox]], were jailed by the Cromwellian authorities and published at their own peril.

During the Interregnum, the royalist forces attached to the court of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] went into exile with the twenty-year-old [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and conducted a brisk business in intelligence and fund-raising for an eventual return to England. Some of the royalist [[lady|ladies]] installed themselves in [[convent]]s in [[Holland]] and France that offered safe haven for indigent and travelling nobles and allies. The men similarly stationed themselves in Holland and France, with the court-in-exile being established in [[The Hague]] before setting up more permanently in [[Paris]]. The nobility who travelled with (and later travelled to) Charles II were therefore lodged for more than a decade in the midst of the continent's literary scene. As Holland and France in the 17th century were little alike, so the influences picked up by courtiers in exile and the travellers who sent intelligence and money to them were not monolithic. Charles spent his time attending plays in France, and he developed a taste for Spanish plays. Those nobles living in Holland began to learn about mercantile exchange as well as the tolerant, [[rationalism|rationalist]] prose debates that circulated in that officially tolerant nation. [[John Bramhall]], for example, had been a strongly [[high church]] [[Christian theology|theologian]], and yet, in exile, he debated willingly with [[Thomas Hobbes]] and came into the Restored church as tolerant in practice as he was severe in argument.&lt;ref name=Bramhall&gt;"[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t95.e789 Bramhall, John]" in ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (2006). Ed. E. A. Livingstone. Oxford Reference Online (subscription required), Oxford University Press. Retrieved on February 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Courtiers also received an exposure to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and its liturgy and pageants, as well as, to a lesser extent, [[Italian poetry]].

===Initial reaction===
[[File:Charles II.2.png|thumb|150px|right|[[Charles II of England|Charles II]]]]
When Charles II became king in 1660, the sense of novelty in literature was tempered by a sense of suddenly participating in European literature in a way that England had not before. One of Charles's first moves was to reopen the theatres and to grant [[letters patent]] giving mandates for the theatre owners and managers. [[Thomas Killigrew]] received one of the patents, establishing the [[King's Company]] and opening the first [[patent theatre]] at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]; Sir [[William Davenant]] received the other, establishing the Duke of York's theatre company and opening his patent theatre in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]].&lt;ref name=ReopenTheatres&gt;Schelling, Felix E. "[http://www.bartleby.com/218/0505.html The Age of Dryden: The Restoration Drama: The King’s and the Duke of York’s Companies “Created” after it]" in Ward and Trent, et al. Retrieved on February 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Drama was public and a matter of royal concern, and therefore both theatres were charged with producing a certain number of old plays, and Davenant was charged with presenting material that would be morally uplifting. Additionally, the position of [[Poet Laureate]] was recreated, complete with payment by a barrel of "sack" ([[Spanish wine|Spanish white wine]]), and the requirement for birthday odes.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund.K.Broadus, ''Laureateship'', Ayer Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8369-1326-4}}, pp. 61&amp;ndash;64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles II was a man who prided himself on his [[wit]] and his worldliness. He was well known as a philanderer as well. Highly witty, playful, and sexually wise poetry thus had court sanction. Charles and his brother [[James II of England|James]], the [[Duke of York]] and future King of England, also sponsored [[mathematics]] and [[natural philosophy]], and so spirited scepticism and investigation into nature were favoured by the court. Charles II sponsored the [[Royal Society]], which courtiers were eager to join (for example, the noted diarist [[Samuel Pepys]] was a member), just as Royal Society members moved in court. Charles and his court had also learned the lessons of exile. Charles was [[High Church]] (and secretly vowed to convert to Roman Catholicism on his death) and James was crypto-Catholic, but royal policy was generally tolerant of religious and political dissenters. While Charles II did have his own version of the [[Test Act]], he was slow to jail or persecute Puritans, preferring merely to keep them from public office (and therefore to try to rob them of their Parliamentary positions). As a consequence, the prose literature of dissent, political theory, and [[economics]] increased in Charles II's reign.

Authors moved in two directions in reaction to Charles's return. On the one hand, there was an attempt at recovering the English literature of the [[English literature#Jacobean literature|Jacobean period]], as if there had been no disruption; but, on the other, there was a powerful sense of novelty, and authors approached [[French literature|Gallic models]] of literature and elevated the literature of wit (particularly [[satire]] and [[parody]]). The novelty would show in the literature of sceptical inquiry, and the Gallicism would show in the introduction of [[Neoclassicism]] into English writing and criticism.

===Top-down history===
The Restoration is an unusual historical period, as its literature is bounded by a specific political event: the restoration of the Stuart monarchy. It is unusual in another way, as well, for it is a time when the influence of that king's presence and personality permeated literary society to such an extent that, almost uniquely, literature reflects the court. The adversaries of the restoration, the Puritans and democrats and republicans, similarly respond to the peculiarities of the king and the king's personality. Therefore, a top-down view of the literary history of the Restoration has more validity than that of most literary epochs. "The Restoration" as a critical concept covers the duration of the effect of Charles and Charles's manner. This effect extended beyond his death, in some instances, and not as long as his life, in others.

==Poetry==
The Restoration was an age of poetry. Not only was poetry the most popular form of literature, but it was also the most ''significant'' form of literature, as poems affected political events and immediately reflected the times. It was, to its own people, an age dominated only by the king, and not by any single genius. Throughout the period, the lyric, ariel, historical, and epic poem was being developed.

===The English epic===
Even without the introduction of Neo-classical criticism, English poets were aware that they had no national [[epic poetry|epic]]. [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]'' was well known, but England, unlike France with ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' or Spain with the ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'' or, most of all, Italy with the ''[[Aeneid]]'', had no epic poem of national origins. Several poets attempted to supply this void.

[[File:William Davenant.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[William Davenant|Sir William Davenant]], operator of the first playhouse opened after the Restoration, was also a playwright and an epic poet.]]
[[William Davenant|Sir William Davenant]] was the first Restoration poet to attempt an epic. His unfinished ''[[Gondibert]]'' was of epic length, and it was admired by Hobbes.&lt;ref name=CambridgeGondibert&gt;Thompson, A. Hamilton. "[http://www.bartleby.com/217/0312.html Cavalier and Puritan: Writers of the Couplet: Sir William D’Avenant; ''Gondibert'']" in Ward and Trent, et al. Retrieved on February 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it also used the [[ballad]] form, and other poets, as well as critics, were very quick to condemn this rhyme scheme as unflattering and unheroic (Dryden ''Epic''). The prefaces to ''Gondibert'' show the struggle for a formal epic structure, as well as how the early Restoration saw themselves in relation to [[Classics|Classical literature]].

Although today he is studied separately from the Restoration period, John Milton's ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' was published during that time. Milton no less than Davenant wished to write the English epic, and chose [[blank verse]] as his form. Milton rejected the cause of English exceptionalism: his ''Paradise Lost'' seeks to tell the story of all mankind, and his pride is in [[Christianity]] rather than Englishness.

Significantly, Milton began with an attempt at writing an epic on [[King Arthur]], for that was the matter of English national founding. While Milton rejected that subject, in the end, others made the attempt. [[Richard Blackmore]] wrote both a ''Prince Arthur'' and ''King Arthur''. Both attempts were long, soporific, and failed both critically and popularly. Indeed, the poetry was so slow that the author became known as "Never-ending Blackmore" (see [[Alexander Pope]]'s lambasting of Blackmore in ''[[The Dunciad]]'').

The Restoration period ended without an English epic. ''[[Beowulf]]'' may now be called the English epic, but the work was unknown to Restoration authors, and [[Old English language|Old English]] was incomprehensible to them.

===Poetry, verse, and odes===
[[Lyric poetry]], in which the poet speaks of his or her own feelings in the [[grammatical person|first person]] and expresses a mood, was not especially common in the Restoration period. Poets expressed their points of view in other forms, usually public or formally disguised poetic forms such as odes, [[pastoral poetry]], and ariel verse. One of the characteristics of the period is its devaluation of individual sentiment and psychology in favour of public utterance and [[philosophy]]. The sorts of lyric poetry found later in the [[Churchyard Poets]] would, in the Restoration, only exist as pastorals.

Formally, the Restoration period had a preferred rhyme scheme.  [[Rhyme|Rhyming]] [[couplet]]s in [[iambic pentameter]] was by far the most popular structure for poetry of all types. Neo-Classicism meant that poets attempted adaptations of [[Latin poetry|Classical meter]]s, but the rhyming couplet in iambic pentameter held a near monopoly. According to Dryden ("Preface to ''The Conquest of Grenada''"), the rhyming couplet in iambic pentameter has the right restraint and dignity for a lofty subject, and its rhyme allowed for a complete, coherent statement to be made. Dryden was struggling with the issue of what later critics in the [[Augustan literature|Augustan period]] would call "decorum": the fitness of form to subject (q.v. Dryden ''Epic''). It is the same struggle that Davenant faced in his ''Gondibert''. Dryden's solution was a [[closed couplet]] in iambic pentameter that would have a minimum of [[enjambment]]. This form was called the "heroic couplet," because it was suitable for heroic subjects. Additionally, the age also developed the mock-heroic couplet. After 1672 and [[Samuel Butler (1612-1680)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Hudibras]]'', iambic tetrameter couplets with unusual or unexpected rhymes became known as [[Hudibrastic|Hudibrastic verse]]. It was a formal [[parody]] of heroic verse, and it was primarily used for satire. [[Jonathan Swift]] would use the Hudibrastic form almost exclusively for his poetry.

Although Dryden's reputation is greater today, contemporaries saw the 1670s and 1680s as the age of courtier poets in general, and [[Edmund Waller]] was as praised as any. Dryden, [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Rochester]], [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]], and [[Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset|Dorset]] dominated verse, and all were attached to the court of Charles. [[Aphra Behn]], [[Matthew Prior]], and [[Robert Gould]], by contrast, were outsiders who were profoundly royalist. The court poets follow no one particular style, except that they all show sexual awareness, a willingness to satirise, and a dependence upon wit to dominate their opponents. Each of these poets wrote for the stage as well as the page. Of these, Behn, Dryden, Rochester, and Gould deserve some separate mention.

[[File:J-Dryden.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[John Dryden]]]]
Dryden was prolific; and he was often accused of plagiarism. Both before and after his Laureateship, he wrote public odes. He attempted the Jacobean pastoral along the lines of [[Walter Raleigh]] and [[Philip Sidney]], but his greatest successes and fame came from his attempts at [[apologetics]] for the restored court and the [[Established Church]]. His ''[[Absalom and Achitophel]]'' and ''[[Religio Laici]]'' both served the King directly by making controversial royal actions seem reasonable. He also pioneered the [[mock-heroic]]. Although Samuel Butler had invented the mock-heroic in English with ''Hudibras'' (written during the Interregnum but published in the Restoration&lt;!--year to be added; I'm not fibbing, it was '72 for first circulation, but publication differs markedly, as the thing floated for a long, long time--&gt;), Dryden's ''[[MacFlecknoe]]'' set up the satirical parody. Dryden was himself not of noble blood, and he was never awarded the honours that he had been promised by the King (nor was he repaid the loans he had made to the King), but he did as much as any peer to serve Charles II. Even when James II came to the throne and Roman Catholicism was on the rise, Dryden attempted to serve the court, and his ''[[The Hind and the Panther]]'' praised the Roman church above all others. After that point, Dryden suffered for his conversions, and he was the victim of many satires.

[[File:Jacob Huysmans - Portrait of John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]], famous as the model [[rake (character)|rake]]. Not long before his death, by [[Jacob Huysmans]]]]
Buckingham wrote some court poetry, but he, like Dorset, was a patron of poetry more than a poet. Rochester, meanwhile, was a prolix and outrageous poet. Rochester's poetry is almost always sexually frank and is frequently political. Inasmuch as the Restoration came after the Interregnum, the very sexual explicitness of Rochester's verse was a political statement and a thumb in the eye of Puritans. His poetry often assumes a lyric pose, as he pretends to write in sadness over his own impotence ("The Disabled Debauchee") or sexual conquests, but most of Rochester's poetry is a parody of an existing, Classically authorised form. He has a mock [[topographical poem]] ("Ramble in [[St. James's Park|St James Park]]", which is about the dangers of darkness for a man intent on copulation and the historical compulsion of that plot of ground as a place for fornication), several mock odes ("To Signore Dildo," concerning the public burning of a crate of "contraband" from France on the [[London]] docks), and mock pastorals. Rochester's interest was in inversion, disruption, and the superiority of wit as much as it was in [[hedonism]]. Rochester's venality led to an early death, and he was later frequently invoked as the exemplar of a Restoration [[rake (character)|rake]].

[[File:Aphra Behn by Mary Beale.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Aphra Behn, the first professional female novelist in English.&lt;ref&gt;Todd p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;]]Aphra Behn modelled the rake Willmore in her play ''The Rover'' on Rochester;&lt;ref name=BehnRoverOxford&gt;Willmore may have also been based on Behn's lover John Hoyle.

Oxford Reference Online (subscription required), Oxford University Press. Retrieved on February 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and while she was best known publicly for her drama (in the 1670s, only Dryden's plays were staged more often than hers), Behn wrote a great deal of poetry that would be the basis of her later reputation. [[Edward Bysshe (writer)|Edward Bysshe]] would include numerous quotations from her verse in his ''Art of English Poetry'' (1702).&lt;ref&gt;See online text at [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/BysEngl.html UVA]&lt;/ref&gt; While her poetry was occasionally sexually frank, it was never as graphic or intentionally lurid and titillating as Rochester's. Rather, her poetry was, like the court's ethos, playful and honest about sexual desire. One of the most remarkable aspects of Behn's success in court poetry, however, is that Behn was herself a commoner. She had no more relation to peers than Dryden, and possibly quite a bit less. As a woman, a commoner, and [[Kent]]ish, she is remarkable for her success in moving in the same circles as the King himself. As [[Janet Todd]] and others have shown, she was likely a spy for the Royalist side during the Interregnum. She was certainly a spy for Charles II in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], but found her services unrewarded (in fact, she may have spent time in [[debtor's prison]]) and turned to writing to support herself.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-9014136 Behn, Aphra]" in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2007). Encyclopædia Britannica Online (subscription required). Retrieved on February 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--"She had neither exceptional beauty nor any wealth at all" "Any wealth"?

[[File:Gould-love.png|thumb|right|180px|Title page to Robert Gould's 1690 ''Love Given O'er,'' the "Satire on Woman"]]

If Behn is a curious exception to the rule of noble verse, [[Robert Gould]] breaks that rule altogether.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Gould was born of a common family and [[orphan]]ed at the age of thirteen. He had no schooling at all and worked as a [[servant (domestic)|domestic servant]], first as a [[footman]] and then, probably, in the [[pantry]]. However, he was attached to the Earl of Dorset's household, and Gould somehow learned to read and write, as well as possibly to read and write [[Latin]]&lt;!-- Did I write that he could? I have no evidence that he was at all conversant; he uses some Latin, but not enough that he couldn't have cribbed it.--&gt;. In the 1680s and 1690s, Gould's poetry was very popular. He attempted to write odes for money, but his great success came with ''Love Given O'er, or A Satyr Upon ... Woman'' in 1692. It was a partial adaptation of a [[satires of Juvenal|satire by Juvenal]], but with an immense amount of explicit invective against women. The [[misogyny]] in this poem is some of the harshest and most visceral in English poetry: the poem sold out all editions. Gould also wrote a ''Satyr on the Play House'' (reprinted in Montagu Sommers's ''The London Stage'') &lt;!-- Do you have bibliographic data for ''The London Stage?''  I canna find it here. It coulda shoulda be in references--&gt;with detailed descriptions of the actions and actors involved in the Restoration stage. He followed the success of ''Love Given O'er'' with a series of misogynistic poems, all of which have specific, graphic, and witty denunciations of female behaviour. His poetry has "[[virgin]]" brides who, upon their wedding nights, have "the straight gate so wide/ It's been leapt by all mankind," noblewomen who have money but prefer to pay the coachman with [[oral sex]], and noblewomen having sex in their coaches and having the [[cobblestone]]s heighten their pleasures. Gould's career was brief, but his success was not a novelty of subliterary misogyny. After Dryden's conversion to Roman Catholicism, Gould even engaged in a [[poison pen letter|poison pen]] battle with the Laureate. His "Jack Squab" (the Laureate getting paid with squab as well as sack and implying that Dryden would sell his soul for a dinner) attacked Dryden's faithlessness viciously, and Dryden and his friends replied. That a footman even ''could'' conduct a verse war is remarkable. That he did so without, apparently, any prompting from his patron is astonishing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Translations and controversialists===
[[Roger L'Estrange]] (per above) was a significant translator, and he also produced verse translations. Others, such as [[Richard Blackmore]], were admired for their "sentence" (declamation and sentiment) but have not been remembered. Also, [[Elkannah Settle]] was, in the Restoration, a lively and promising political satirist, though his reputation has not fared well since his day. After booksellers began hiring authors and sponsoring specific translations, the shops filled quickly with poetry from hirelings. Similarly, as [[periodical literature]] began to assert itself as a political force, a number of now anonymous poets produced topical, specifically [[occasional verse]].

The largest and most important form of ''incunabula'' of the era was satire. There were great dangers in being associated with satire and its publication was generally done anonymously. To begin with, [[slander and libel|defamation]] law cast a wide net, and it was difficult for a satirist to avoid prosecution if he were proven to have written a piece that seemed to criticise a noble. More dangerously, wealthy individuals would often respond to satire by having the suspected poet physically attacked by ruffians. The Earl of Rochester hired such thugs to attack John Dryden suspected of having written ''An Essay on Satire''. A consequence of this anonymity is that a great many poems, some of them of merit, are unpublished and largely unknown. Political satires against [[cabal|The Cabal]], against Sunderland's government, and, most especially, against James II's rumoured conversion to Roman Catholicism, are uncollected. However, such poetry was a vital part of the vigorous Restoration scene, and it was an age of energetic and voluminous satire.

==Prose genres==
Prose in the Restoration period is dominated by [[Christian literature|Christian religious writing]], but the Restoration also saw the beginnings of two genres that would dominate later periods: [[fiction]] and journalism. Religious writing often strayed into political and economic writing, just as political and economic writing implied or directly addressed religion.

===Philosophical writing===
The Restoration saw the publication of a number of significant pieces of political and philosophical writing that had been spurred by the actions of the Interregnum. Additionally, the court's adoption of Neo-classicism and [[empiricism|empirical]] science led to a receptiveness toward significant philosophical works.

[[File:A History of the Royal Society, by Thomas Sprat (frontispiece).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Frontispiece to Thomas Sprat's ''History of the Royal Society'', 1667]]

[[Thomas Sprat]] wrote his ''[[History of the Royal Society]]'' in 1667 and set forth, in a single document, the goals of empirical science ever after. He expressed grave suspicions of [[adjective]]s, nebulous terminology, and all language that might be subjective. He praised a spare, clean, and precise vocabulary for science and explanations that are as comprehensible as possible. In Sprat's account, the Royal Society explicitly rejected anything that seemed like [[scholasticism]]. For Sprat, as for a number of the founders of the Royal Society, science was [[Protestantism|Protestant]]: its reasons and explanations had to be comprehensible to all. There would be no [[priest]]s in science, and anyone could reproduce the experiments and hear their lessons. Similarly, he emphasised the need for conciseness in description, as well as reproducibility of experiments.

[[File:Flea-Hooke.gif|thumb|left|150px|Image of a [[flea]] from [[Robert Hooke]]'s ''[[Micrographia]]'' (1665), a [[Royal Society]] work]]
[[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]], after he retired from being what today would be called [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], wrote several [[bucolic]] prose works in praise of retirement, contemplation, and direct observation of nature. He also brought the [[Ancients and Moderns]] quarrel into English with his ''Reflections on Ancient and Modern Learning''. The debates that followed in the wake of this quarrel would inspire many of the major authors of the first half of the 18th century (most notably Swift and [[Alexander Pope]]).

The Restoration was also the time when [[John Locke]] wrote many of his philosophical works. Locke's empiricism was an attempt at understanding the basis of human understanding itself and thereby devising a proper manner for making sound decisions. These same scientific methods led Locke to his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', which later inspired the thinkers in the [[American Revolution]]. As with his work on understanding, Locke moves from the most basic units of society toward the more elaborate, and, like [[Thomas Hobbes]], he emphasises the plastic nature of the [[social contract]]. For an age that had seen [[absolute monarchy]] overthrown, [[democracy]] attempted, democracy corrupted, and [[constitutional monarchy|limited monarchy]] restored; only a flexible basis for government could be satisfying.

===Religious writing===
The Restoration moderated most of the more strident sectarian writing, but radicalism persisted after the Restoration. Puritan authors such as [[John Milton]] were forced to retire from public life or adapt, and those [[Diggers]], [[Fifth Monarchist]], [[Levellers|Leveller]], [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]], and [[Anabaptist]] authors who had preached against monarchy and who had participated directly in the [[regicide]] of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] were partially suppressed. Consequently, violent writings were forced underground, and many of those who had served in the Interregnum attenuated their positions in the Restoration.

Fox, and [[William Penn]], made public vows of [[pacifism]] and preached a new theology of peace and love. Other Puritans contented themselves with being able to meet freely and act on local parishes. They distanced themselves from the harshest sides of their religion that had led to the abuses of Cromwell's reign. Two religious authors stand out beyond the others in this time: [[John Bunyan]] and [[Izaak Walton]].

Bunyan's ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' is an [[allegory]] of personal [[salvation]] and a guide to the Christian life. Instead of any focus on [[eschatology]] or divine retribution, Bunyan instead writes about how the individual [[saint]] can prevail against the temptations of mind and body that threaten damnation. The book is written in a straightforward narrative and shows influence from both drama and [[biography]], and yet it also shows an awareness of the allegorical tradition found in [[Edmund Spenser]].

[[File:The Compleat Angler, by Izaak Walton (1653) (title page).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Title page to Walton's ''The Compleat Angler, or the Contemplative man's Recreation'']]
Izaak Walton's ''[[The Compleat Angler]]'' is similarly introspective. Ostensibly, his book is a guide to [[angling|fishing]], but readers treasured its contents for their descriptions of nature and serenity. There are few analogues to this prose work. On the surface, it appears to be in the tradition of other guide books (several of which appeared in the Restoration, including [[Charles Cotton]]'s ''The Compleat Gamester'', which is one of the earliest attempts at settling the rules of [[card game]]s), but, like ''Pilgrim's Progress'', its main business is guiding the individual.

More court-oriented religious prose included sermon collections and a great literature of debate over the [[convocation]] and issues before the [[House of Lords]]. The [[Act of First Fruits and Fifths]], the [[Test Act]], the [[Act of Uniformity 1662]], and others engaged the leading divines of the day. [[Robert Boyle]], notable as a scientist, also wrote his ''Meditations'' on [[God]], and this work was immensely popular as devotional literature well beyond the Restoration. (Indeed, it is today perhaps most famous for [[Jonathan Swift]]'s parody of it in ''[[Meditation Upon a Broomstick]]''.)  Devotional literature in general sold well and attests a wide literacy rate among the English middle classes.

===Journalism===
During the Restoration period, the most common manner of getting news would have been a [[broadsheet]] publication. A single, large sheet of paper might have a written, usually partisan, account of an event. However, the period saw the beginnings of the first professional and periodical (meaning that the publication was regular) [[journalism]] in England. Journalism develops late, generally around the time of [[William III of England|William of Orange]]'s claiming the throne in 1689. Coincidentally or by design, England began to have newspapers just when William came to court from [[Amsterdam]], where there were already newspapers being published.

The early efforts at news sheets and periodicals were spotty. [[Roger L'Estrange]] produced both ''The News'' and ''City Mercury'', but neither of them was a sustained effort. [[Henry Muddiman]] was the first to succeed in a regular news paper with the ''[[London Gazette]]''. In 1665, Muddiman produced the ''Oxford Gazette'' as a digest of news of the royal court, which was in [[Oxford]] to avoid the [[Great Plague of London|plague in London]]. When the court moved back to [[Whitehall]] later in the year, the title ''London Gazette'' was adopted (and is still in use today).&lt;ref&gt;[[London Gazette]], [http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/GazettesHistory.aspx?GeoType=London History]. Retrieved on 2008-01-07&lt;/ref&gt; Muddiman had begun as a journalist in the Interregnum and had been the official journalist of the [[Long Parliament]] (in the form of ''The Parliamentary Intelligencer''). Although Muddiman's productions are the first regular news accounts, they are still not the first modern newspaper, as the work was sent in manuscript by post to subscribers and was not a printed sheet for general sale to the public. That had to wait for ''[[The Athenian Mercury]]''.

[[File:Athenian-oracle-front.gif|thumb|left|200px|A detail of the frontispiece to ''The Athenian Oracle'', a collection of ''The Athenian Mercury'']]
Sporadic essays combined with news had been published throughout the Restoration period, but ''The Athenian Mercury'' was the first regularly published periodical in England. [[John Dunton]] and the "Athenian Society" (actually a mathematician, minister, and philosopher paid by Dunton for their work) began publishing in 1691, just after the reign of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] began. In addition to news reports, ''The Athenian Mercury'' allowed readers to send in questions anonymously and receive a printed answer. The questions mainly dealt with love and health, but there were some bizarre and intentionally amusing questions as well (e.g. a question on why a person shivers after [[urination]], written in rhyming couplets). The questions section allowed the journal to sell well and to be profitable. Therefore, it ran for six years, produced four books that spun off from the columns, and then received a bound publication as ''The Athenian Oracle''. He also published the first periodical designed  for women "The Ladies' Mercury".

''The Athenian Mercury'' set the stage for the later ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'', ''Gray's Inn Journal'', ''Temple Bar Journal'', and scores of politically oriented journals, such as the original ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Observer]]'', ''The Freeholder'', ''Mist's Journal'', and many others. Also, ''The Athenian Mercury'' published poetry from contributors, and it was the first to publish the poetry of Jonathan Swift and [[Elizabeth Rowe|Elizabeth Singer Rowe]]. The trend of newspapers would similarly explode in subsequent years; a number of these later papers had runs of a single day and were composed entirely as a method of planting political attacks (Pope called them "Sons of a day" in ''[[Dunciad]] B'').•	Later Romantic writers, who valued the idea of originality, also prized the meaning of "revolution" which signified a violent break with the past and often represented their work as offering just such a break with tradition. However, changes to literary forms and content occurred much more gradually than this use of the word "revolution" might suggest.

===Fiction===
Although it is impossible to satisfactorily date the beginning of the [[novel]] in English, long fiction and fictional biographies began to distinguish themselves from other forms in England during the Restoration period. An existing tradition of ''Romance'' fiction in France and Spain was popular in England. [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' engendered prose narratives of love, peril, and revenge, and [[Gauthier de Costes, seigneur de la Calprenède]]'s novels were quite popular during the Interregnum and beyond.

The "Romance" was considered a feminine form, and women were taxed with reading "novels" as a vice. Inasmuch as these novels were largely read in French or in translation from French, they were associated with effeminacy. However, novels slowly divested themselves of the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] and [[chivalry|chivalric]] trappings and came to centre on more ordinary or [[picaresque]] figures. One of the most significant figures in the rise of the novel in the Restoration period is [[Aphra Behn]]. She was not only the first professional female novelist, but she may also be among the first professional novelists of either sex in England.

[[File:Behn Oroonoko title page.1688.jpg|left|thumb|150px|First edition of [[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Oroonoko]]'', 1688]]
Behn's first novel was ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister]]'' in 1684. This was an [[epistolary novel]] documenting the amours of a scandalous nobleman who was unfaithful to his wife with her sister (thus making his lover his sister-in-law rather than biological sister). The novel is highly romantic, sexually explicit, and political. Behn wrote the novel in two parts, with the second part showing a distinctly different style from the first. Behn also wrote several "Histories" of fictional figures, such as her ''The History of a Nun''. As the genre of "novel" did not exist, these histories were prose fictions based on biography.  However, her most famous novel was ''[[Oroonoko]]'' in 1688. This was a fictional biography, published as a "true history", of an African king who had been enslaved in [[Suriname]], a colony Behn herself had visited.

Behn's novels show the influence of [[tragedy]] and her experiences as a dramatist. Later novels by [[Daniel Defoe]] would adopt the same narrative framework, although his choice of biography would be tempered by his experience as a journalist writing "true histories" of criminals.

Other forms of fiction were also popular. Available to readers were versions of the stories of ''[[Reynard the Fox]]'', as well as various indigenous folk tales, such as the various [[Dick Whittington]] and [[Tom Thumb]] fables. Most of these were in verse, but some circulated in prose. These largely anonymous or folk compositions circulated as [[chapbook]]s.

===Subliterary genres and writers===
Along with the figures mentioned above, the Restoration period saw the beginnings of explicitly political writing and hack writing. [[Roger L'Estrange]] was a [[pamphleteer]] who became the surveyor of presses and licenser of the press after the Restoration. In 1663–6, L'Estrange published ''The News'' (which was not regular in its appearance, see above). When he was implicated in the [[Popish Plot]] and fled England, he published ''The Observator'' (1681–1687) to attack [[Titus Oates]] and the Puritans. L'Estrange's most important contributions to literature, however, came with his translations. He translated [[Erasmus]] in 1680, [[Francisco de Quevedo|Quevedo]] in 1668, and, most famously and importantly, [[Aesop]]'s ''[[Aesop's Fables|Fables]]'' in 1692 and 1699. This last set off a small craze for writing new fables, and particularly political fables.

Also during the later part of the period, [[Charles Gildon]] and [[Edmund Curll]] began their work on hireling "Lives." Curll was a bookseller (what today would be called a publisher), and he paid authors to produce biographies, translations, and the like. Similarly, Gildon, who was an occasional friend of Restoration authors, produced biographies with wholesale inventions in them. This writing for pay was despised by the literary authors, who called it "hack" writing.

==Theatre==
===Context===
[[File:Dorset Gardens riverfront.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Duke's Theatre at Dorset Gardens]]
The return of the stage-struck Charles II to power in 1660 was a major event in English theatre history. As soon as the previous Puritan regime's ban on public stage representations was lifted, the drama recreated itself quickly and abundantly. Two theatre companies, the King's and the Duke's Company, were established in London, with two luxurious playhouses built to designs by [[Christopher Wren]] and fitted with moveable [[scenery]] and thunder and lightning machines.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, Robert D. (1976), ''The Development of English Drama in the Late Seventeenth Century'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press), pp. 233—238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Restoration plays have been studied by [[literary genre|genre]] rather than chronology, more or less as if they were all contemporary, but scholars today insist on the rapid evolvement of drama in the period and on the importance of social and political factors affecting it. (Unless otherwise indicated, the account below is based on Hume's influential ''Development of English Drama in the Late Seventeenth Century'', 1976.) The influence of theatre company competition and playhouse economics is also acknowledged, as is the significance of the appearance of the first professional actresses (see Howe).

In the 1660s and 1670s, the London scene was vitalised by the competition between the two [[letters patent|patent]] companies. The need to rise to the challenges of the other house made playwrights and managers extremely responsive to public taste, and theatrical fashions fluctuated almost week by week. The mid-1670s were a high point of both quantity and quality, with [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[Aureng-zebe]]'' (1675), William Wycherley's ''[[The Country Wife]]'' (1675) and ''[[The Plain Dealer (play)|The Plain Dealer]]'' (1676), George Etherege's ''[[The Man of Mode]]'' (1676), and [[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[The Rover (play)|The Rover]]'' (1677), all within a few [[theatre season|season]]s.

From 1682 the production of new plays dropped sharply, affected both by a merger between the two companies and by the political turmoil of the [[Popish Plot]] (1678) and the [[Exclusion crisis]] (1682). The 1680s were especially lean years for comedy, the only exception being the remarkable career of [[Aphra Behn]], whose achievement as the first professional British woman dramatist has been the subject of much recent study. There was a swing away from comedy to serious [[politics|political]] drama, reflecting preoccupations and divisions following on the political crisis. The few comedies produced also tended to be political in focus, the [[British Whig Party|whig]] dramatist [[Thomas Shadwell]] sparring with the [[Tory|tories]] [[John Dryden]] and [[Aphra Behn]].

In the calmer times after 1688, Londoners were again ready to be amused by stage performance, but the single "United Company" was not well prepared to offer it. No longer powered by competition, the company had lost momentum and been taken over by predatory investors ("Adventurers"), while management in the form of the autocratic [[Christopher Rich (theatre manager)|Christopher Rich]] attempted to finance a tangle of "farmed" shares and sleeping partners by slashing actors' salaries. The upshot of this mismanagement was that the disgruntled actors set up their own co-operative company in 1695.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous details two separate, but connected events: the capitalist machinations that gutted the company (pp. 37&amp;ndash;43), and the unique, startling reaction of the actors, who fought back by setting up their own cooperative and revitalizing London theatre life (pp. 51&amp;ndash;68).&lt;/ref&gt; A few years of re-invigorated two-company competition followed which allowed a brief second flowering of the drama, especially comedy. Comedies like [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]]'s ''[[Love For Love]]'' (1695) and ''[[The Way of the World]]'' (1700), and [[John Vanbrugh]]'s ''[[The Relapse]]'' (1696) and ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'' (1697) were "softer" and more middle class in ethos, very different from the aristocratic extravaganza twenty years earlier, and aimed at a wider audience. If "Restoration literature" is the literature that reflects and reflects upon the court of Charles II, Restoration drama arguably ends before Charles II's death, as the playhouse moved rapidly from the domain of courtiers to the domain of the city middle classes. On the other hand, Restoration drama shows altogether more fluidity and rapidity than other types of literature, and so, even more than in other types of literature, its movements should never be viewed as absolute. Each decade has brilliant exceptions to every rule and entirely forgettable confirmations of it.

===Drama===
{{main|Heroic drama}} 
{{see also|She-tragedy}}

Genre in Restoration drama is peculiar. Authors labelled their works according to the old tags, "comedy" and "drama" and, especially, "history", but these plays defied the old categories. From 1660 onwards, new dramatic genres arose, mutated, and intermixed very rapidly. In tragedy, the leading style in the early Restoration period was the male-dominated [[heroic drama]], exemplified by John Dryden's ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' (1670) and ''[[Aureng-Zebe]]'' (1675) which celebrated powerful, aggressively masculine heroes and their pursuit of glory both as rulers and conquerors, and as lovers. These plays were sometimes called by their authors' histories or tragedies, and contemporary critics will call them after Dryden's term of "[[Heroic drama]]". Heroic dramas centred on the actions of men of decisive natures, men whose physical and (sometimes) intellectual qualities made them natural leaders. In one sense, this was a reflection of an idealised king such as Charles or Charles's courtiers might have imagined. However, such dashing heroes were also seen by the audiences as occasionally standing in for noble rebels who would redress injustice with the sword. The plays were, however, tragic in the strictest definition, even though they were not necessarily sad.

In the 1670s and 1680s, a gradual shift occurred from heroic to [[pathos|pathetic]] tragedy, where the focus was on love and domestic concerns, even though the main characters might often be public figures. After the phenomenal success of [[Elizabeth Barry]] in moving the audience to tears in the role of Monimia in Thomas Otway's ''[[The Orphan (play)|The Orphan]]'' (1680), "she-tragedies" (a term coined by [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]]), which focused on the sufferings of an innocent and virtuous woman, became the dominant form of pathetic tragedy. Elizabeth Howe has argued that the most important explanation for the shift in taste was the emergence of tragic actresses whose popularity made it unavoidable for dramatists to create major roles for them. With the conjunction of the playwright "master of pathos" Thomas Otway and the great tragedienne Elizabeth Barry in ''The Orphan'', the focus shifted from hero to heroine. Prominent she-tragedies include [[John Banks (playwright)|John Banks]]'s ''[[Virtue Betrayed, or, Anna Bullen]]'' (1682) (about the execution  of [[Anne Boleyn]]), [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''The Fatal Marriage'' (1694), and [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]]'s ''[[The Fair Penitent]]'' (1703) and ''[[Lady Jane Grey]]'', 1715.

While she-tragedies were more comfortably tragic, in that they showed women who suffered for no fault of their own and featured [[tragic flaw]]s that were emotional rather than moral or intellectual, their success did not mean that more overtly political tragedy was not staged. The [[Exclusion crisis]] brought with it a number of tragic implications in real politics, and therefore any treatment of, for example, the [[Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] (several versions of which were circulated and briefly acted at non-patent theatres) could be read as [[sedition|seditious]]. Thomas Otway's ''[[Venice Preserv'd]]'' of 1682 was a royalist political play that, like Dryden's ''Absalom and Achitophel'', seemed to praise the king for his actions in the ''meal tub plot''. Otway's play had the floating city of [[Venice]] stand in for the river town of [[London]], and it had the dark senatorial plotters of the play stand in for the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Earl of Shaftesbury]]. It even managed to figure in the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], Charles's illegitimate, war-hero son who was favoured by many as Charles's successor over the Roman Catholic James. ''Venice Preserv'd'' is, in a sense, the perfect synthesis of the older politically royalist tragedies and histories of Dryden and the newer she-tragedies of feminine suffering, for, although the plot seems to be a political [[allegory]], the action centres on a woman who cares for a man in conflict, and most of the scenes and dialogue concern her pitiable sufferings at his hands.

===Comedy===
{{main|Restoration comedy}}
Restoration comedy is notorious for its [[human sexual behavior|sexual]] explicitness, a quality encouraged by Charles II personally and by the [[Rake (character)|rakish]] [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] ethos of his [[noble court|court]]. The best-known plays of the early Restoration period are the unsentimental or "hard" comedies of [[John Dryden]], [[William Wycherley]], and [[George Etherege]], which reflect the atmosphere at Court, and celebrate an aristocratic [[machismo|macho]] lifestyle of unremitting sexual intrigue and conquest. The [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]], real-life Restoration rake, courtier and poet, is flatteringly portrayed in Etherege's ''[[Man of Mode]]'' (1676) as a riotous, witty, intellectual, and sexually irresistible aristocrat, a template for posterity's idea of the glamorous Restoration rake (actually never a very common character in Restoration comedy). Wycherley's ''[[The Plain Dealer (play)|The Plain Dealer]]'' (1676), a variation on the theme of [[Molière]]'s ''[[Le misanthrope]]'', was highly regarded for its uncompromising satire and earned Wycherley the appellation "Plain Dealer" Wycherley or "Manly" Wycherley, after the play's main character Manly. The single writer who most supports the charge of [[obscenity]] levelled then and now at Restoration comedy is probably Wycherley.

During the second wave of Restoration comedy in the 1690s, the "softer" comedies of [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]] and [[John Vanbrugh]] reflected mutating cultural perceptions and great social change. The playwrights of the 1690s set out to appeal to more socially mixed audiences with a strong [[middle class|middle-class]] element, and to female spectators, for instance by moving the war between the sexes from the arena of intrigue into that of marriage. The focus in comedy is less on young lovers outwitting the older generation, more on marital relations after the wedding bells. In Congreve's plays, the give-and-take set pieces of couples still testing their attraction for each other have mutated into witty prenuptial debates on the eve of marriage, as in the famous "Proviso" scene in ''[[The Way of the World]]'' (1700).

Restoration drama had a bad reputation for three centuries. The "incongruous" mixing of comedy and tragedy beloved by Restoration audiences was decried. The [[Victorian literature|Victorians]] denounced the comedy as too indecent for the stage,&lt;ref name=Macaulay&gt;In response to the 1840 publication of [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]]'s collection of works by Wycherley, Congreve, Vanbrugh, and Farquhar, [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]] wrote a scathing critique of Restoration plays, noting that they "ought not to be reprinted". Macaulay, Thomas Babington (1841). "Review of Leigh Hunt, ed. ''The Dramatic Works of Wycherley, Congreve, Vanbrugh, and Farquhar''" in Project Gutenberg's ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2333 Critical and Historical Essays — Volume 2]''. Retrieved on 27 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and the standard reference work of the early 20th century, ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature'', dismissed the tragedy as being of "a level of dulness and lubricity never surpassed before or since".&lt;ref name=CambridgeRestorationDrama&gt;Bartholomew, A. T. and Peterhouse, M. A. "[http://www.bartleby.com/218/0702.html The Age of Dryden: The Restoration Drama: Public Interest in Acting]" in Ward and Trent, et al. Retrieved on February 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Restoration total theatre experience is again valued, both by [[postmodernism|postmodern]] literary critics and on the stage.

===Spectacular===
{{main|Restoration spectacular}}
The Restoration spectacular, or elaborately staged ''machine play'', hit the [[London]] public stage in the late 17th-century [[English Restoration|Restoration]] period, enthralling audiences with action, music, dance, moveable [[theatrical scenery|scenery]], [[baroque illusionistic painting]], gorgeous costumes, and [[special effect]]s such as [[trapdoor]] tricks, "flying" actors, and [[fireworks]]. From the start, these shows had ill reputations as vulgar and commercial threats to the witty, "legitimate" [[Restoration drama]]s. They drew Londoners in unprecedented numbers, however, and left them dazzled and delighted.

'''Sex differences in cognition''', or mental abilities, are widely studied in the current scientific literature. Biological and genetic differences in combination with environment and culture have resulted in the [[cognition|cognitive]] differences among men and women. Among biological factors, hormones such as [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]] may play some role mediating these differences. Among differences of diverse mental and cognitive abilities, the largest or most well known are those relating to spatial abilities, social cognition and verbal [[skills]] and abilities.

== Cognitive abilities ==
Cognitive abilities are mental abilities that a person uses in everyday life, as well as  specific demand tasks. The most basic of these abilities are [[memory]], [[executive function]], [[processing speed]] and [[perception]], which combine to form a larger perceptual umbrella relating to different social, [[Affect (psychology)|affective]], verbal and spatial  information. Memory, which is one of the primary core of cognitive abilities can be broken down into [[short-term memory]], [[working memory]] and [[long-term memory]]. There are also other abilities relating to perceptual information such as [[mental rotation]], [[spatial visualization ability]], [[Verbal fluency test|verbal fluency]] and [[reading comprehension]]. Other larger perceptual umbrellas include [[social cognition]], [[empathy]], spatial perception and verbal abilities.

== Sex differences in memory ==

=== Short term memory ===
Various researchers have conducted studies to determine the differences between men and women and their abilities within their short-term memory. For example, a study conducted by Lowe, Mayfield, and Reynolds (2003) examined gender differences among children and adolescents on various short-term memory measures.  This study included 1,279 children and adolescents, 637 males and 642 females, between the ages of 5 and 19. They found that females scored higher on two verbal subtests: Word Selective Reminding and Object Recall, and males scored higher on the Memory for Location and Abstract Visual Memory subtests, the key spatial memory tasks. In two different studies researchers have found that women perform higher on verbal tasks and men perform higher on spatial tasks (Voyer, Voyer, &amp; Saint-Aubin, 2016). These findings are consistent with studies of intelligence with regards to pattern, females performing higher on certain verbal tasks and males performing higher on certain spatial tasks (Voyer, Voyer, &amp; Saint-Aubin, 2016). Same results have been also found cross culturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex differences in cognitive abilities: A cross-cultural perspective|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002839329090141A|journal = Neuropsychologia|date = 1990-01-01|pages = 1063–1077|volume = 28|issue = 10|doi = 10.1016/0028-3932(90)90141-A|first = Virginia A.|last = Mann|first2 = Sumiko|last2 = Sasanuma|first3 = Naoko|last3 = Sakuma|first4 = Shinobu|last4 = Masaki}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sex differences in verbal short term memory have been found regardless of age even among adults, for example a review published in the journal ''[[Neuropsychologia]]'' which evaluated studies from 1990–2013 found greater female verbal memory from ages 11–89 years old.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why women see differently from the way men see?

=== Working memory ===
There are usually no sex differences in overall working memory except those involving spatial information such as space and object. A 2004 study published in the journal of ''Applied Cognitive Psychology'' found significantly higher male performance on four visuo-spatial working memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender effects in spatial orientation: cognitive profiles and mental strategies|journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology|date = 2004-07-01|issn = 0888-4080|pmc = 2909401|pmid = 20676381|pages = 519–532|volume = 18|issue = 5|doi = 10.1002/acp.1000|first = Andrea|last = Bosco|first2 = Anna M|last2 = Longoni|first3 = Tomaso|last3 = Vecchi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2010 study published in the journal ''[[Brain and Cognition]]'' found a male advantage in spatial and object working memory on an n-back test but not for verbal working memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Male Advantage for Spatial and Object but Not Verbal Working Memory Using the N-Back Task|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ923021|journal = Brain and Cognition|issn = 0278-2626|pages = 191–196|volume = 76|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.bandc.2010.12.002|pmid = 21411205|first = Lisa|last = Lejbak|first2 = Margaret|last2 = Crossley|first3 = Mirna|last3 = Vrbancic|year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly another study published in the journal ''[[Human Brain Mapping (journal)|Human Brain Mapping]]'' found no sex differences in a verbal n-back working memory task among adults from ages 18–58 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = No gender differences in brain activation during the N-back task: an fMRI study in healthy individuals|journal = Human Brain Mapping|date = 2009-11-01|issn = 1097-0193|pmid = 19387979|pages = 3609–3615|volume = 30|issue = 11|doi = 10.1002/hbm.20783|first = Heike|last = Schmidt|first2 = Jigar|last2 = Jogia|first3 = K.|last3 = Fast|first4 = Tessa|last4 = Christodoulou|first5 = Morgan|last5 = Haldane|first6 = V.|last6 = Kumari|first7 = S.|last7 = Frangou}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also no sex differences in verbal working memory among a study of university students published in the ''Journal of Dental and Medical Sciences''. However, they still found greater male spatial working memory in studies published in the journals ''Brain Cognition'' and ''Intelligence''.&lt;ref name="Kaufman 211–223"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex differences in mental rotation and spatial visualization ability: Can they be accounted for by differences in working memory capacity?|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222398504|journal = Intelligence|pages = 211–223|volume = 35|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2006.07.009|first = Scott Barry|last = Kaufman|year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A sex difference on a novel spatial working memory task in humans|journal = Brain and Cognition|date = 2001-12-01|issn = 0278-2626|pmid = 11748902|pages = 470–493|volume = 47|issue = 3|doi = 10.1006/brcg.2001.1326|first = S. J.|last = Duff|first2 = E.|last2 = Hampson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, even though they found no sex differences in verbal working memory, researchers have found lower brain activity or hermodynamics in the [[prefrontal cortex]] of women which suggested greater [[Neural efficiency hypothesis|neural efficiency]] and less effort for the same performance.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender-specific hemodynamics in prefrontal cortex during a verbal working memory task by near-infrared spectroscopy|journal = Behavioural Brain Research|date = 2010-05-01|issn = 1872-7549|pmid = 20117145|pages = 148–153|volume = 209|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.bbr.2010.01.033|first = Ting|last = Li|first2 = Qingming|last2 = Luo|first3 = Hui|last3 = Gong}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers indicate women might have greater working memory on tasks that only relies on the [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A 2013 study published in the journal  ''Current Research in Psychology'' also found a female advantage in one visual-working memory task among university students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://thescipub.com/PDF/crpsp.2012.33.39.pdf|title = GENDER DIFFERENCES IN COGNITIVE ABILITES ''(Sic)''|last = A.

=== Long term memory ===
Studies have found a greater female ability in episodic memory involving verbal or both verbal and visual-spatial tasks while a higher male ability that only involves complex visual-spatial episodic memory.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; For example, a study published in the journal ''[[Neuropsychology (journal)|Neuropsychology]]'' found that women perform at a higher level on most verbal episodic tasks and tasks involving some or little visual-spatial episodic memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex differences in episodic memory: the impact of verbal and visuospatial ability|journal = Neuropsychology|date = 1999-10-01|issn = 0894-4105|pmid = 10527068|pages = 590–597|volume = 13|issue = 4|first = A.|last = Herlitz|first2 = E.|last2 = Airaksinen|first3 = E.|last3 = Nordström|doi=10.1037/0894-4105.13.4.590}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study published the following year found that women perform at a higher level in verbal and non-verbal (non-spatial visual) episodic memory but men performed at a higher level in complex visual-spatial episodic memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex differences favoring women in verbal but not in visuospatial episodic memory|journal = Neuropsychology|date = 2001-04-01|issn = 0894-4105|pmid = 11324860|pages = 165–173|volume = 15|issue = 2|first = C.|last = Lewin|first2 = G.|last2 = Wolgers|first3 = A.|last3 = Herlitz|doi=10.1037/0894-4105.15.2.165}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review published in the journal ''[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]]'' by researcher Agneta Herlitz also conclude that higher ability in women on episodic-memory tasks requiring both verbal and visuospatial episodic memory and on face-recognition tasks.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex Differences in Episodic Memory|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228618349|journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science|pages = 52–56|volume = 17|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00547.x|first = Agneta|last = Herlitz|first2 = J.|last2 = Rehnman|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex differences in semantic memory have also been found with a higher female ability which can be explained by a female advantage in verbal fluency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Selective sex differences in declarative memory|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7921958|journal = Memory &amp; Cognition|volume = 32|issue = 7|pages = 1160–1169|accessdate = 2016-01-06|doi = 10.3758/BF03196889|year = 2004|last1 = Maitland|first1 = Scott B.|last2 = Herlitz|first2 = Agneta|last3 = Nyberg|first3 = Lars|last4 = Bäckman|first4 = Lars|last5 = Nilsson|first5 = Lars-Göran}}&lt;/ref&gt; One other study also found greater female free-recall and long term retrieval among the ages 5–17.&lt;ref name="Keith 389–404"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex differences in latent cognitive abilities ages 5 to 17: Evidence from the Differential Ability Scales—Second Edition|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232383641|journal = Intelligence|pages = 389–404|volume = 39|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2011.06.008|first = Timothy Z.|last = Keith|first2 = Matthew R.|last2 = Reynolds|first3 = L.

== Sex differences in executive functions ==
There has not been enough literature or studies assessing sex difference in executive functioning, especially since executive functions are not a unitary concept. However, in the ones that have been done, there have been differences found in attention and inhibition.

=== Attention ===
A 2002 study published in the ''[[Journal of Vision]]'' found that males were faster at shifting attention from one object to another as well as shifting attention within objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = JOV {{!}} Sex differences in shifting attention within and between objects|url = http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2120199|journal = Journal of Vision|volume = 2|issue = 7|pages = 13|access-date = 2016-02-12|doi = 10.1167/2.7.13|year = 2010|last1 = Brown|first1 = J.

=== Inhibition and self-regulation ===
A 2008 study published in the journal ''[[Psychophysiology (journal)|Psychophysiology]]'' found faster reaction time to deviant stimuli in women.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender differences in behavioral inhibitory control: ERP evidence from a two-choice oddball task|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23244165|journal = Psychophysiology|pages = 986–993|volume = 45|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.2008.00693.x|pmid = 18778319|first = Jiajin|last = Yuan|first2 = Yuanyuan|last2 = He|first3 = Zhang|last3 = Qinglin|first4 = Antao|last4 = Chen|first5 = Hong|last5 = Li|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also analyzed past literature and found higher female performance in withholding social behavior such as aggressive responses and improper sexual arousal.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Furthermore, they found evidence that women were better at resisting temptation in tasks, delaying gratification and controlling emotional expressions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; They also found lower female effort in response inhibition in equal performance for the same tasks implying an advantage for females in response inhibition based on [[Neural efficiency hypothesis|neural efficiency]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In another study published in 2011 in the journal ''Brain and Cognition'', it was found that females outperformed males on the ''Sustained Attention to Response Task'' which is a test that measures inhibitory control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Inhibitory control and empathy-related personality traits: Sex-linked associations|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262611000777|journal = Brain and Cognition|date = 2011-08-01|pages = 364–368|volume = 76|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.bandc.2011.04.004|pmid = 21570758|first = Stefan|last = Hansen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have hypothesized that any female advantage in inhibition or self-regulation may have evolved as a response to greater parenting responsibilities in ancestral settings.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Sex differences in processing speed ==
Sex differences in processing speed has been largely noted in literature. Studies published in the journal ''[[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]]'' have found faster processing speed in women. For example, a 2006 study published in ''Intelligence'' by researcher Stephen Camarata and Richard Woodcock found faster processing speed in females across all age groups in a sample of 4,213 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex differences in processing speed: Developmental effects in males and females|year=2006|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222702039|journal = Intelligence|pages = 231–252|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2005.12.001|first = Stephen|last = Camarata|first2 = Richard|last2 = Woodcock}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by another study published in 2008 by researchers Timothy Z Keith and Matthew R.

==Sex differences in semantic perception==
Studies of sex differences in semantic perception (attribution of meaning) of words reported that males conceptualize items in terms of physical or observable attributes whereas females use more evaluative concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Haas |first1=A.|year=1979|title= Male and female spoken language difficulties: stereotypes and evidence.|journal= Psychological Bulletin|volume=86|issue=3|pages=616–626|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.86.3.616}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1982

Contrary to common beliefs, women gave more negative scores to the concepts describing sensational objects, social and physical attractors but more positive estimations to work- and reality-related words, in comparison to men &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trofimova|first1=IN|year=2012|url =

In a light of the higher rates of sensation seeking and deviancy in males, in comparison to females, these sex differences in meaning attribution were interpreted as support for the Evolutionary theory of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trofimova |first1=I.|year=2015|jstor=10.5406/amerjpsyc.128.4.0485|title= Do psychological sex differences reflect evolutionary bi-sexual partitioning? |journal =American Journal of Psychology|volume=128 | issue = 4  |pages=485–514|doi= 10.5406/amerjpsyc.128.4.0485| pmid=26721176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex differences in spatial abilities ==

Sex differences in [[Spatial ability|spatial abilities]] are widely established in literature. Males have much higher level of performance in three major spatial tasks which include [[Spatial ability|spatial visualization]], [[Spatial ability|spatial perception]] and [[Spatial ability|mental rotation]].&lt;ref name="Linn 1479–1498"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emergence and Characterization of Sex Differences in Spatial Ability: A Meta-Analysis|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19086027|journal = Child Development|pages = 1479–1498|volume = 56|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1985.tb00213.x|first = Marcia C.|last = Linn|first2 = Anne C.|last2 = Petersen|year = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex differences in cognitive functions|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222512913|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|volume = 35|issue = 4|pages = 863–875|access-date = 2016-02-01|doi = 10.1016/S0191-8869(02)00288-X|year = 2003|last1 = Weiss|first1 = Elisabeth M.|last2 = Kemmler|first2 = Georg|last3 = Deisenhammer|first3 = Eberhard A.|last4 = Fleischhacker|first4 = W.Wolfgang|last5 = Delazer|first5 = Margarete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial visualization elicits the smallest difference with a deviation of 0.13, perception a deviation of 0.44 and mental rotation the largest with a deviation of 0.73.&lt;ref name="Linn 1479–1498"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender differences in cognition: A minefield of research issues|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251566000|journal = The Irish Journal of Psychology|pages = 386–396|volume = 18|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/03033910.1997.1010558158|first = Tadhg|last = Maclntyre|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Impact of cognitive imaging and sex differences on the development of laparoscopic suturing skills|journal = Canadian Journal of Surgery|date = 2005-10-01|issn = 0008-428X|pmc = 3211902|pmid = 16248138|pages = 387–393|volume = 48|issue = 5|first = Tyrone|last = Donnon|first2 = Jean-Gaston|last2 = DesCôteaux|first3 = Claudio|last3 = Violato}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2013 meta-analysis published in the journal ''Educational Review'' found greater male mental rotation in a deviation of 0.57 which only grew larger as time limits were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Meta-Analysis on Gender Differences in Mental Rotation Ability Measured by the Purdue Spatial Visualization Tests: Visualization of Rotations (PSVT:R)|journal = Educational Psychology Review|date = 2012-12-09|issn = 1040-726X|pages = 69–94|volume = 25|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s10648-012-9215-x|first = Yukiko|last = Maeda|first2 = So Yoon|last2 = Yoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These male advantages manifests themselves in math and mechanical tasks for example significantly higher male performance on tests of [[Geometry|geometr]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;y, [[measurement]], [[probability]], [[statistics]] and especially [[Mechanical aptitude|mechanical reasoning]].&lt;ref name="Differences"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex Affects Behavior and Perception|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222297/|date = 2001-01-01|first = Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Understanding the Biology of Sex and Gender|last = Differences|first2 = Theresa M.|last2 = Wizemann|first3 = Mary-Lou|last3 = Pardue}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also manifests and largely mediates higher male performance in arithmetic and computational fluency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex differences in spatial cognition, computational fluency, and arithmetical reasoning|journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|date = 2000-12-01|issn = 0022-0965|pmid = 11063633|pages = 337–353|volume = 77|issue = 4|doi = 10.1006/jecp.2000.2594|first = D.

=== Empathy ===
Empathy is a large part of [[social cognition]] and facilitates its cognitive components known as [[theory of mind]]. Current literature suggests a consistent higher level of [[empathy]] in woman compared to men.

Throughout prehistory, females nurtured and were the primary caretakers of children, so this might have led to an evolved neurological adaptation for women to be more aware and responsive to non-verbal expressions. According to the ''Primary Caretaker Hypothesis'', prehistoric males did not have the same selective pressure as primary caretakers; so therefore this might explain modern day sex differences in emotion recognition and empathy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{globalize/US|date=August 2017}}
A '''syllabus''' ({{IPAc-en|'|s|ɪ|l|ə|b|ə|s}}; plural ''syllabuses''&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{OED|syllabus}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''syllabi''&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary &lt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/syllabus&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) is an academic document that communicates course information and defines expectations and
responsibilities. It is descriptive (unlike the prescriptive or specific [[curriculum]]). A syllabus may be set out by an [[exam]] board or prepared by the [[professor]] who supervises or controls course quality.

There are seven essential components to an academic syllabus:
Instructor information,
General course information,
Course objectives,
Course policies,
Grading and evaluation,
Learning resources, and the
Course Calendar.
{{cn|date=August 2017}}

==Definition==
The syllabus is a "contract between faculty members and their students, designed to answer students' questions about a course, as well as inform them about what will happen should they fail to meet course expectations." &lt;ref name="Slattery &amp; Carlson 2005"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Slattery
  | first = J.M.
  | last2 = Carlson
  | first2 =  J.F.

  | pages = 159–164
  | year = 2005|doi=10.3200/CTCH.53.4.159-164

  | journal = College Teaching
  | volume = 53
  | pages = 62–64
  | year = 2005
| issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the notion of a syllabus as a contract has grown more literal but is not in fact an enforceable contract.&lt;ref name="Wasley 2008"&gt;{{cite journal

==Etymology==
According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the word ''syllabus'' derives from [[New Latin|modern Latin]] ''syllabus'' "list", in turn from a misreading of the Greek σίττυβας ''sittybas'' "parchment label, table of contents", which first occurred in a 15th-century print of [[Cicero]]'s letters to Atticus.&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary - Syllabus|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=syllabus|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier Latin dictionaries such as [[Lewis and Short]] contain the word ''syllabus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|syllabus|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; relating it to the non-existent Greek word σύλλαβος, which appears to be a mistaken reading of ''syllaba'' "syllable"; the newer [[Oxford Latin Dictionary]] does not contain this word.&lt;ref name="Epectasis"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Curious and Quibbling History of "Syllabus" (part 2)|url=http://epectasis.blogspot.com/2010/07/curious-and-quibbling-history-of_23.html|work=Epekteinomene|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published source inline|date=September 2018}} The apparent change from ''sitty-'' to ''sylla-'' is explained as a [[hypercorrection]] by analogy to συλλαμβάνω (''syllambano'' "bring together, gather").&lt;ref name="Epectasis" /&gt;

==Purpose==
The syllabus ensures a fair and impartial understanding between the instructor and students such that there is minimal confusion on policies relating to the course, setting clear expectations of material to be learned, behavior in the classroom, and effort on student's behalf to be put into the course, providing a roadmap of course organization/direction relaying the instructor's teaching philosophy to the students, and providing a marketing angle of the course such that students may choose early in the course whether the subject material is attractive.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Many generalized items of a syllabus can be amplified in a specific curriculum to maximize efficient learning by clarifying  student understanding of specified material such as grading policy, grading rubric, late work policy, locations and times, other contact information for instructor and teaching assistant such as phone or email, materials required and/or recommended such as textbooks, assigned reading books, calculators (or other equipment), lab vouchers, etc., outside resources for subject material assistance (extracurricular books, tutor locations, resource centers, etc.), important dates in course such as exams and paper due-dates, tips for succeeding in mastering course content such as study habits and expected time allotment, suggested problems if applicable, necessary pre-requisites or co-requisites to current course, safety rules if appropriate, and objectives of the course.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

A syllabus will often contain a reading list of relevant books and articles that are compulsory or optional for students to read. As an indirect effect of this, scholars can count how many online syllabi include their works as a way of estimating their educational impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/asi.20920| title = Assessing the impact of disciplinary research on teaching: An automatic analysis of online syllabuses| journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology| volume = 59| issue = 13| pages = 2060| year = 2008| last1 = Kousha | first1 = K. | last2 = Thelwall | first2 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tondo''' (plural "tondi" or "tondos") is a [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] term for a [[Circle|circular]] work of art, either a [[painting]] or a [[sculpture]]. The word derives from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''rotondo,'' "round."  The term is usually not used in English for small round paintings, but only those over about 60&amp;nbsp;cm (two feet) in diameter, thus excluding many round [[portrait miniature]]s – for sculpture the threshold is rather lower.

==History==
Artists have created tondi since [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]. The circular paintings in the centre of [[Pottery of ancient Greece#Development of vase painting|painted vases]] of that period are known as tondi, and the inside of the broad low winecup called a ''[[Kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]]'' also lent itself to circular enframed compositions.&lt;ref&gt;E. F. van der Grinten, ''On the Composition of the Medallions in the Interiors of Greek Black- and Red-Figured Kylixes''. Amsterdam 1966&lt;/ref&gt; The style was revived in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, particularly in Italy, where it may have developed from the smaller [[desco da parto]] or birthing tray.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/sandro-botticelli-the-adoration-of-the-kings "''The Adoration of the Kings'', about 1470-5, Sandro Botticelli"], National Gallery&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has been less common. In [[Ford Madox Brown]]'s painting ''[[The Last of England (painting)|The Last of England]]'', the ship's wire railing curving round the figures helps enclose the composition within its tondo shape.

The background scene is consolidated or omitted, and to a large extent, unimportant. While the background may be visible in tondo paintings, in tondo relief carvings the background is not seen. [[Andrea della Robbia]] and other members of his family created glazed terracotta ''tondi'' that were often framed in a wreath of fruit and leaves and which were intended for immuring in a stuccoed wall. In [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s [[Ospedale degli Innocenti|Hospital of the Innocents]], Florence, 1421–24,  Andrea della Robbia provided glazed terracotta babes in swaddling clothes in tondos with plain blue backgrounds to be set in the [[spandrel]]s of the arches.

In the sixteenth century the painterly style of ''istoriato'' decoration for [[maiolica]] wares was applied to large circular dishes (see also [[Charger (table setting)|charger]]).

The tondo has also been used as a design element in [[architecture]] since the [[Renaissance]]; it may serve centered in the gable-end of a [[pediment]] or under the round-headed [[arch]] that was revived in the fifteenth century.

Although the earliest true Renaissance, or late Gothic painted tondo is Burgundian, from [[Champmol]]  (of a ''Pietá'' by [[Jean Malouel]] of 1400-15, now in the [[Louvre]]), the tondo became fashionable in 15th century [[Florence]], with [[Botticelli]] painting many examples, both [[Madonna (art)|Madonnas]] and narrative scenes.  [[Michelangelo]] employed the circular tondo for several compositions, both painted and sculpted, including ''The Holy Family with the infant St. John the Baptist'', the ''[[Doni Tondo]]'' at the [[Uffizi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artchive.com/artchive/M/michelangelo/holy_family.jpg.html|title=Michelangelo, The Doni Tondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Raphael]].

The infrequently-encountered synonym ''[[rondo]]''&lt;ref name="Artlex"&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/  Artlex.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424084418/http://www.artlex.com/ |date=2005-04-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; much more usually refers to a musical form.

Argentina has become famous for its rich European flavor.

==Tourist attractions==
{{unsourced|section|date=May 2015}}
The most popular tourist sites are found in the historic core of the city, in the [[Montserrat, Buenos Aires|Montserrat]] and [[San Telmo]] neighborhoods. Buenos Aires was conceived around the [[Plaza de Mayo]], the colony's administrative center. To the east of the square is the ''[[Casa Rosada]]'', the official seat of the [[executive branch]] of the government of Argentina. To the north, the ''[[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral|Catedral Metropolitana]]'' which has stood in the same location since colonial times, and the [[Banco de la Nación Argentina]] building, a parcel of land originally owned by [[Juan de Garay]]. Other important colonial institutions were [[Buenos Aires Cabildo|Cabildo]], to the west, which was renovated during the construction of [[Avenida de Mayo]] and Julio A. Roca. To the south is the ''Congreso de la Nación'' (National Congress), which currently houses the ''Academia Nacional de la Historia'' (National Academy of History). Lastly, to the northwest, is City Hall.

''Avenida de Mayo'' links the ''Casa Rosada'' with the [[Argentine National Congress]]. On this avenue there are several buildings of cultural, architectural, and historical importance, such as ''[[Casa de la Cultura (Buenos Aires)|Casa de la Cultura]]'', the ''[[Palacio Barolo]]'' and ''[[Café Tortoni]]''. Underneath the avenue, the first ''subte'' (metro) [[Line A (Buenos Aires Metro)|line]]  [[Image:Línea A (SBASE).svg|18px]] in [[South America]], opened in 1913. The avenue ends at ''[[Congressional Plaza|Plaza del Congreso]]'', which features a number of monuments and sculptures, including one of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s few surviving original casts of "[[The Thinker]]". 2007 list of the World's Best Cities, by [[Travel + Leisure]] Magazine. Today it still ranks in top 10.

[[Image:Buenos Aires - Jardín Japonés - 200806d.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Buenos Aires Japanese Gardens, the World's largest outside Japan]]

The ''[[w:es:Manzana de las Luces|Manzana de las Luces]]'' ("Illuminated Block") area features the San Ignacio church, the ''[[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires|Colegio Nacional Buenos Aires]]'', and the old city council building (1894 to 1931). This area features tunnels and catacombs, which crossed underneath the [[Plaza de Mayo]] during colonial times. In the San Telmo neighborhood of,  ''[[Plaza Dorrego]]'' hosts an antiques fair on Sundays, complete with [[tango (dance)|tango]] shows. They also have tango shows daily at the famous plaza. On weekends they involve many tourists to learn how to dance. Frequent tours and activities are also available at the Church of ''Nuestra Señora de Bethlehem'', the ''San Pedro Telmo'' Parish and the Antonio Ballvé Penintetiary Museum. The ''[[Museo Histórico Nacional de Argentina|National Historical Museum]]'' in ''[[Parque Lezama]]'' is a few blocks south. The ''[[Ayres Porteños Hostel]]'' is a very famous hostel as it is also a tourist attraction, it is decorated and painted by artists from La Boca and possesses a unique collection of local paintings among its walls.

The borough of [[Recoleta, Buenos Aires|Recoleta]] is home to a number of places of interest, including the ''[[Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Buenos Aires)|Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes]]'', the ''[[Biblioteca Nacional de la República Argentina|Biblioteca Nacional]]'', the ''[[Centro Cultural Recoleta]]'', the Faculty of Law of the [[Universidad de Buenos Aires]], the ''Basílica Nuestra Señora de Pilar'', the [[Palais de Glace]], the [[Café La Biela]] and the [[Cementerio de la Recoleta]], where [[Eva Perón]]'s crypt can be visited, among those of many other Argentine historical and cultural figures.

[[El Ateneo Grand Splendid]] is one of the city's most well-known bookshops and, having moved from its original downtown location, today operates on [[Avenida Santa Fe|Santa Fé Avenue]], where "[[Barrio Norte, Buenos Aires|Barrio Norte]]" meets the borough of [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]]. Once a theatre and later a cinema, the building still retains the feeling of the grand theatre it once was, despite its recent renovation. Plaza Italia, site of a monument to [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], the [[Buenos Aires Zoo]], the [[Buenos Aires Botanical Gardens|botanical gardens]], and the [[Parque Tres de Febrero|Palermo woods]] (famous for its paddleboat lake, rose garden, and [[planetarium]]) are all a short walk to the east of it.

[[Image:Dique 4 Puerto Madero.jpg|thumb|left|275px|View of the [[Puerto Madero]] district]]
The borough of [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]] features the [[Estación Retiro|Retiro Railway Terminal]] and several other notable landmarks, including the [[Plaza San Martín (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Martín]] square, its monument to the [[Falklands War]] Fallen, an [[equestrian statue]] of [[José de San Martín|General San Martín]] and, nearby, the Anglo-Argentine community's present to Argentina the [[Torre Monumental]] (formerly Torre de los Ingleses), the ornate ''Basilica Santísimo Sacramento'' and the [[Art Deco]] [[Kavanagh Building]], still one of the tallest in the city.

The ''[[Museo de Arte Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires]]'' is located in the ''barrio'' of [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]], and is one of the most important in the country. In this neighbourhood can also be found the ''[[Parque tres de febrero|Bosques de Palermo]]'', the Planetary and [[Buenos Aires Zoo]].

The southern area of the city, (including ''barrios'' such as [[Barracas, Buenos Aires|Barracas]] and [[Parque Patricios]]) while traditionally not a top tourist destination, is historically the source for much of the city's early tango culture. It is now home to a burgeoning arts scene. Another important tourist site is [[Avenida Corrientes]]; among dozens of cinemas, theatres, booksellers and music shops, this avenue is home to the [[Centro Cultural General San Martín|San Martín Cultural Center]], [[Paseo La Plaza]] and the [[Luna Park, Buenos Aires|Luna Park]] coliseum.

'''Urban Gothic''' is a subgenre of [[Gothic fiction]], [[horror film|film horror]] and television dealing with [[industry|industrial]] and [[post-industrial]] urban society. It was pioneered in the mid-19th century in Britain, Ireland and the United States and developed in British novels such as [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' (1886), and Irish novels such as [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1890), and [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897). In the twentieth century, urban Gothic influenced the creation of the subgenres of [[Southern Gothic]] and [[suburban Gothic]]. From the 1980s, interest in the urban Gothic revived with books like [[Anne Rice]]'s [[Vampire Chronicles]] and a number of [[graphic novel]]s that drew on dark city landscapes, leading to adaptations in film including ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989), ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'' (1994) and ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'' (2001), as well as influencing films like ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' (1995).&lt;ref name="S. Macek, 2006 pp. 240-1"&gt;S. Macek, ''Urban Nightmares: the Media, the Right, and the Moral Panic Over the City'' (University of Minnesota Press, 2006), pp. 240–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Development===
[[File:Tom All Alones.2.jpg|upright|thumb|left|An illustration from [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Bleak House]]'' of Tom All Alones, the urban slum credited as a major influence on the development of the genre]]
In English literature, the architectural [[Gothic revival]] and classical [[Romanticism]] gave rise to the [[Gothic novel]] in the second half of the eighteenth century, often dealing with dark themes in human nature against medieval backdrops and with elements of the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;F. Botting, ''Gothic'' (CRC Press, 1996), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' (1764) by [[Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford]], it was perfected as a literary form by [[Ann Radcliffe]] in novels such as ''[[The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne]]'' (1789), ''[[A Sicilian Romance]]'' (1790) and ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' (1794).&lt;ref&gt;R. Miles, ''Ann Radcliffe: the Great Enchantress'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; It also included [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818) and [[John Polidori]]'s ''[[The Vampyre]]'' (1819), which helped found the modern horror genre.&lt;ref&gt;S. T. Joshi, ''Icons of Horror and the Supernatural: an Encyclopedia of our Worst Nightmares'' (Greenwood, 2007), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; This helped create the [[dark romanticism]] or [[American Gothic Fiction]] of authors like [[Edgar Allan Poe]] in works including "[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]" (1839) and "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]" (1842) and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] in "[[The Minister's Black Veil]]" (1836) and "[[The Birth-Mark]]" (1843).&lt;ref&gt;S. T. Joshi, ''Icons of Horror and the Supernatural: an Encyclopedia of our Worst Nightmares, Volume 1'' (Greenwood, 2007), p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn influenced American novelists like [[Herman Melville]] in works such as ''[[Moby Dick]]'' (1851).&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Smith, ''American Gothic Fiction: an Introduction'' (Continuum, 2004), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Victorian Gothic novels that employed contemporary rural settings included [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' (1847) and [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' (1847).&lt;ref&gt;D. David, ''The Cambridge Companion to the Victorian Novel'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas these early Gothic novels had tended to use the city as a starting point and then moved to rural locations, abandoning the settings and securities of urban civilisation for wild and dangerous rural regions, the Gothic novels of the mid-nineteenth century began to reverse this process, or were conducted entirely in the modern industrial city, which itself became a zone of [[liminality]], danger and adventure, and from the late twentieth century have been referred to as urban Gothic.&lt;ref name=Mighall2007&gt;R. Mighall, "Gothic Cities", in C. Spooner and E. McEvoy, eds, ''The Routledge Companion to Gothic'' (Routledge, 2007), pp. 54–72.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Mighall]] sees the urban Gothic as a genre arising in London in the mid-nineteenth century out of the critique of the impact of industrialisation that led to the discourse on urban reform that can be seen in [[City mysteries|City Mystery]] genre, including [[The Mysteries of Paris]] (1842–43) and the works of authors like [[G. W. M. Reynolds]]' ''Mysteries of London'' (1844–8) as well as the stories of [[Charles Dickens]]', ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' (1837–8) and ''[[Bleak House]]'' (1854).&lt;ref&gt;R. Mighall, ''A Geography of Victorian Gothic Fiction: Mapping History's Nightmares'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; These pointed to the juxtaposition of wealthy, ordered and affluent civilisation next to the disorder and barbarity of the poor within the same metropolis. ''Bleak House'' in particular is credited with seeing the introduction of [[smog|urban fog]] to the novel, which would become a frequent characteristic of urban Gothic literature and film.&lt;ref name=Mighall2007pp56-7&gt;R. Mighall, "Gothic Cities", in C. Spooner and E. McEvoy, eds, ''The Routledge Companion to Gothic'' (Routledge, 2007), pp. 56–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The urban Gothic genre that developed in the Victorian [[Fin de siècle]], beginning with [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' (1886), was influenced by these views of a hidden city, the [[Whitechapel murders]], by [[Charles Darwin]]'s ideas on natural selection, and later by [[Freud]]'s ideas about the human mind.&lt;ref name=Mighall2007pp56-7/&gt; They often incorporated ideas about the influence of modern science on life and the mixture of science and the supernatural in urban Gothic novels has led Katherine Spencer to describe them as "a mediating form between science fiction and fantasy."&lt;ref&gt;K. Spencer. "Victorian urban Gothic: the first fantastic literature", in G. E. Slusser and E. S. Rabkin, eds, ''Intersections: Fantasy and Science Fiction'' (SIU Press, 1987), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde restated traditional debates about the nature of good and evil, using motifs from folklore, but with a modern and scientific explanation.&lt;ref&gt;B. M. Stableford, ''Space, Time, and Infinity: Essays on Fantastic Literature'' (Wildside Press LLC, 1998), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1890), similarly revisited the concept of a [[deal with the Devil|Faustian Pact]], but in a modern social context.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Twitchell, ''The Living Dead: a Study of the Vampire in Romantic Literature'' (Duke University Press, 1987), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897) utilised the eastern fringes of Europe in [[Transylvania]] as a point of origin for the arrival in modern provincial and then metropolitan London society of a creature from folklore.&lt;ref&gt;S. Arata, ''Fictions of Loss in the Victorian Fin de Siècle'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early twentieth century, the urban Gothic was extended to other cities, like Paris, utilised in [[Gaston Leroux]]'s ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1909–10).&lt;ref name=Mighall2007/&gt;

===Modern interpretations===
[[File:Noalleynight.jpg|thumb|upright|A dark alley in the French Quarter of New Orleans at night, part of the distinctive architecture that made it the centre of Gothic novels by authors including [[Anne Rice]] and [[Poppy Z. Brite]]]]
From the twentieth century urban Gothic helped to spawn other subgenres, including [[Southern Gothic]], using the Southern United States as a location,&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Smith, ''American Gothic Fiction: an Introduction'' (Continuum, 2004), pp. 121–3.&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Suburban Gothic]], which shifted the focus from the urban centre to the residential periphery of modern society.&lt;ref&gt;B. Murphy, ''The Suburban Gothic in American Popular Culture'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s Gothic horror fiction and urban Gothic in particular has revived as a genre, with series of novels like [[Anne Rice]]'s [[Vampire Chronicles]] and [[Poppy Z. Brite]]'s ''[[Lost Souls (Poppy Z. Brite novel)|Lost Souls]]'',&lt;ref name=Melton1994gothic/&gt; both making [[New Orleans]] a key centre of Gothic fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;G. Hoppenstand and R. B. Browne, eds, ''The Gothic World of Anne Rice'' (Popular Press, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Urban Gothic themes and images were also used in comics and graphic novels, including [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' (from 1979), ''[[Batman]]'' (from 1986) and ''[[Sin City]]'' series (from 1991), [[James O'Barr]]'s ''[[The Crow]]'', beside [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[From Hell]]'' (from 1991) and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;A. W. Smith, "Gothic and the Graphic Novel", in C. Spooner and E. McEvoy, eds, ''The Routledge Companion to Gothic'' (Routledge, 2007), pp. 251–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
{{Main|Horror film}}
Urban Gothic novels were among the earliest and most influential works adapted for the cinema, helping to form the genre of horror film. These included ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922), ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925), ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931) and ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' (1941).&lt;ref&gt;K. Spencer, ''Film and Television Scores, 1950–1979: A Critical Survey By Genre'' (McFarland, 2008), pp. 222–3.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, emphasis shifted to films that more often drew inspiration from the insecurities of life, utilising new technology and dividing into three the subgenres of [[horror-of-personality]], the horror-of-Armageddon and the [[horror-of-demonic|horror-of-the-demonic]].&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Weaver and R.C. Tamborini, ''Horror Films: Current Research on Audience Preferences and Reactions'' (Routledge, 1996), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the late 1950s and early 1960s, the British company [[Hammer Film Productions]] enjoyed huge international success from Technicolor films involving classic Gothic horror characters, often starring [[Peter Cushing]] and [[Christopher Lee]], particularly ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' (1958), which resulted in many sequels into the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Melton1994gothic&gt;J. G. Melton, ''The Vampire Book: the Encyclopedia of the Undead'' (Visible Ink Press, 1994), pp. 298–303.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1983 vampire film ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'' provided a highly influential modernised and urbanised version of Gothic culture.&lt;ref name=Melton1994gothic/&gt; The same themes have been revisited periodically in films like ''[[Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992).&lt;ref&gt;D. J. Skal, ''The Monster Show: a Cultural History of Horror'' (Macmillan, 2001), p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 1980s urban Gothic-influenced comics were the basis for a number of films that drew on dark city landscapes including: ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989), ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'' (1994), ''[[Vampire in Brooklyn]]'' (1995), ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'' (1998), ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'' (2001), ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' (2003), ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' (2005) and ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' (2009). Other films dealing with similar dark themes and urban landscapes include: ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' (1995), ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]]'' (1998), ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'',&lt;ref&gt;K. Sterling, "Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass: ''Fight Club'' as a refraction of Hogg's ''Justified Sinner'' and Stevenson's ''Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde''", in S. O. Jaén and C. Gutleben, eds, ''Refracting the Canon in Contemporary British Literature and Film'' (Amsterdamn: Rodopi, 2004), {{ISBN|90-420-1050-9}}, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hamlet (2000 film)|Hamlet]]'' (2000), ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]'' (2000), ''[[Underworld (2003 film)|Underworld]]'' (2003), ''[[The Machinist]]'' (2004) and ''[[Darling (2015 American film)|Darling]]'' (2015).&lt;ref name="S.
