'''293T''' (or HEK293T) is a human cell line, derived from the [[HEK 293]] cell line, that expresses a mutant version of the [[SV40 large T antigen]].  It is very commonly used in biology for protein expression and production of recombinant [[retroviruses]].

== Origin ==
293T was created in Michele Calos's lab at Stanford by [[transfection#Stable and transient transfection|stable transfection]] of the HEK 293 cell line with a plasmid encoding a temperature-sensitive mutant of the SV40 large T antigen; it was originally referred to as 293/''tsA1609neo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DuBridge RB, Tang P, Hsia HC, Leong PM, Miller JH, Calos MP |title=Analysis of mutation in human cells by using an Epstein-Barr virus shuttle system |journal=Mol. Cell. Biol. |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=379–387 |date=Jan 1987 |pmid=3031469 |pmc=365079 |doi=10.1128/MCB.7.1.379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first reference to the cell line as "293T" may be its use to create the [[BOSC23]] packaging cell line for producing retroviral particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pear WS, Nolan GP, Scott ML, Baltimore D |title=Production of high-titer helper-free retroviruses by transient transfection |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA |volume=90 |issue=18 |pages=8392–8396 |date=15 Sep 1993 |pmid=7690960 |pmc=47362 |doi=10.1073/pnas.90.18.8392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
The transfection used to create 293T (involving plasmid pRSV-1609) conferred [[neomycin]]/[[G418]] resistance and expression of the tsA1609 allele of SV40 large T antigen; this allele is fully active at 33&amp;nbsp;°C (its [[permissive temperature]]), has substantial function at 37&amp;nbsp;°C, and is inactive at 40&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rio DC, Clark SG, Tjian R |title=A mammalian host-vector system that regulates expression and amplification of transfected genes by temperature induction |journal=Science |volume=227 |issue=4682 |pages=23–28 |date=4 Jan 1985 |pmid=2981116 |doi=10.1126/science.2981116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  293T is very efficiently transfectable with DNA (like its parent HEK 293).  Due to the expression of SV40 large T antigen, transfected plasmid DNAs that carry the SV40 [[origin of replication]] can replicate in 293T and will transiently maintain a high copy number; this can greatly increase the amount of recombinant protein or retrovirus that can be produced from the cells.

== Genome ==
The full genome sequences of three different isolates of 293T have been determined.  They are quite similar to each other but show detectable divergence from the parental HEK 293 cell line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin YC, Boone M, Meuris L, Lemmens I, Van Roy N, Soete A, Reumers J, Moisse M, Plaisance S, Drmanac R, Chen J, Speleman F, Lambrechts D, Van de Peer Y, Tavernier J, Callewaert N |title=Genome dynamics of the human embryonic kidney 293 lineage in response to cell biology manipulations |journal=Nat. Commun. |volume=5 |at=4767 |date=3 Sep 2014 |pmid=25182477 |pmc=4166678 |doi=10.1038/ncomms5767 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu Muhammad Abd Allah bin Muhammad bin Qasim bin Hilal bin Yazid bin 'Imran al-'Absi al-Qaysi''' was an early Muslim jurist and theologian.&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Humaydī]], ''Jadhwat al-Muqtabis'', vol. 2, entry #418.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Having been born in [[Islamic Spain]], Ibn Qasim moved to [[Iraq]] for a time, studying directly under [[Dawud al-Zahiri]]. He ended up leaving the [[Maliki]]te rite of Muslim [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]] for the [[Zahiri]]te branch, and was considered by [[Christopher Melchert]] to be the first Zahirite in the region.&lt;ref&gt;''The Islamic school of law -  
evolution, devolution, and progress'', pg. 118. Eds. Rudolph Peters and Frank E. Vogel. [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]: [[Harvard Law School]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Qasim copied his teacher's books by hand and was responsible for spreading them throughout [[Al-Andalus]].

Ibn Qasim died in the year 272 on the [[Islamic calendar]], corresponding to 885 or 886 on the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref name=samir541&gt;Samir Kaddouri, "Refutations of Ibn Hazm by Maliki Authors from al-Andalus and North Africa." Taken from ''Ibn Hazm of Cordoba: The Life and Works of a Controversial Thinker'', pg. 541. Eds. [[Camilla Adang]], [[Maribel Fierro]] and [[Sabine Schmidtke]]. [[Leiden]]: [[Brill Publishers]], 2013. {{ISBN|9789004243101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was listed by later Zahirite jurist [[Ibn Hazm]] as having been, along with [[Ruwaym]], [[Ibn al-Mughallis]] and [[Mundhir bin Sa'īd al-Ballūṭī]], one of the primary proponents of the Zahirite [[Madhhab|school]] of [[Islamic law]].&lt;ref name=samir541/&gt; Ibn Hazm, who was also an early champion of the school, was essentially reviving Ibn Qasim's efforts;&lt;ref&gt;S. M. Imamuddin, ''Muslim Spain 711-1492 A.D.: A Sociological Study'' pg. 156. [[Leiden]]: [[Brill Publishers]], 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; earlier Zahirites such as Balluti kept their views to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Sharif Khan and Mohammad Anwar Saleem, ''Muslim Philosophy And Philosophers'', pg. 35. [[New Delhi]]: Ashish Publishing House, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bilal Orfali]], "In the Shadow of Arabic: The Centrality of Language to Arab Culture." Pg. 34. [[Brill Publishers]], 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt]] and Pierre Cachi, "History of Islamic Spain," pg. 66. [[Edinburgh University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adam''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 4)|fourth season]] of the television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. Portrayed by [[George Hertzberg]], he is a monster created from a man and the collected parts of demons, vampires, and technology: the product of a perverse experiment carried out by military scientists. The series' main character, [[Buffy Summers]], encounters and ultimately defeats him in the fourth season. Adam is the creation of Dr. [[Maggie Walsh]] ([[Lindsay Crouse]]), the head of a military-like organization called [[The Initiative (Buffy the Vampire Slayer organization)|The Initiative]] that studies how to alter the harmful behavior inherent to demons. Adam and the Initiative are the fourth season's primary antagonists, or [[Big Bad]].

The premise of the series is that Buffy ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]) is a [[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Slayer]], endowed with superhuman strength to fight vampires and evil creatures in the fictional town of [[Sunnydale]]. In the fourth season, Buffy begins attending college, where she discovers that her psychology professor, Walsh, is a scientist for the Initiative. Adam is Dr. Walsh's horrible masterpiece, an allusion to [[Frankenstein's monster]], whose first conscious act is killing his creator. Adam's search for understanding himself and his true nature, combined for his penchant for chaos, leads him to orchestrate a massacre between demons and humans, after which he will be able use body parts left over from the melee to create an army of monsters to set loose on Sunnydale. Buffy's effectiveness as a Slayer is increased because her close friends and family, called the [[Scooby Gang (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Scooby Gang]], assist her in her battles. By the end of season four the members of the group have become estranged and must come back together in order to defeat the apparently invincible Adam.

[[Buffy studies]] scholars have critically examined the character of Adam, noting that he is a clear reference to [[Frankenstein's monster]]. Throughout the action of the novel, the monster constantly asks what he is and why he was created, much like Adam. Whedon wanted Adam to be inquisitive and introspective, directing George Hertzberg to "find the stillness" in the character. The presence of Adam also serves to question tradition and authority, specifically institutional authority, which is a repeated theme on the show. Adam has a "design flaw": Adam finds Dr. Walsh unnecessary (his existence supplemented with technology), and as such kills her{{em dash}}a clear example of rejecting authority. Critical reception to Adam has largely ranged from mixed to negative. Some commentators felt his subplot was confusing and unconvincing. Others enjoyed the concept and praised the make-up and special effects used to create the character.

==Character arc==

===Television appearances===
Adam makes his first appearance on the thirteenth episode of season four, "[[The I in Team]]". The first twelve episodes of the season establish the overarching themes, with increasing focus on the mysterious activities of the Initiative. Buffy and Willow begin attending college, an experience which overwhelms Buffy immediately as she finds herself far outside her comfort zone.&lt;ref&gt;Holder, ''et al.'', pp. 196–208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stafford, pp. 215–220&lt;/ref&gt; In the season premiere, Buffy and Willow begin attending a challenging psychology class taught by Dr. [[Maggie Walsh]] ([[Lindsay Crouse]]). She also meets Dr. Walsh's teaching assistant [[Riley Finn]] ([[Marc Blucas]]) and they become attracted to each other. Riley is in charge of a military commando organization that hunts vampires and demons, and captures them for research. It is not revealed to audiences that Dr. Walsh is the head of the research branch of Riley's military organization, called the Initiative, until the [[The Initiative (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|seventh episode]].&lt;ref&gt;Holder, ''et al.'', pp. 196–212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stafford, pp. 215–231&lt;/ref&gt;

The Initiative's goals are gradually made clearer. A recurring character since the second season is [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] ([[James Marsters]]), a mercenary vampire who has fought both against and with Buffy in the past, depending on what suits his interests. Recently wanting to kill Buffy, Spike is captured by the Initiative before he can get to her and implanted with a chip in his brain that causes intense pain if he tries to attack humans to feed on them, or even to fight them.&lt;ref&gt;Holder, ''et al.'', pp. 212–214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stafford, pp. 222–225&lt;/ref&gt; Buffy begins enthusiastically training with the Initiative, spending more time with Riley, and trying to impress Dr. Walsh. At different times, Willow, Xander, and Giles caution Buffy that she does not know the Initiative's true motives and there are questions about their mission that are unanswered. Buffy begins asking questions during "[[The I in Team]]". After being sent after a Polgara demon, a being with a skewer in its arm, she wants to know why the demon must be captured alive and unharmed as she is used to killing demons. Her questions at first confound Dr. Walsh—who answers to no one—then cement Dr. Walsh's decision to remove Buffy from the Initiative. After a botched attempt to kill Buffy, Dr. Walsh consoles herself by going into laboratory room 314 and speaking to her pet project, Adam who is laying on a table, apparently unconscious. Adam rises and impales Dr. Walsh with the skewer in his arm—the one taken off the Polgara demon. His first word is "Mommy", which he says as Dr. Walsh falls to the floor, dead.&lt;ref&gt;Holder, ''et al.'', pp. 227–230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="s231"&gt;Stafford, pp. 231–232&lt;/ref&gt;

Riley, meanwhile, learns of Dr. Walsh's death and his comrades [[Forrest Gates|Forrest]] ([[Leonard Roberts]]) and [[Graham Miller (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Graham]] ([[Bailey Chase]]) suspect Buffy to be her murderer. Extremely agitated and showing signs of drug withdrawal, he follows Buffy and demands to know the truth in "[[Goodbye Iowa]]". None of them are aware of Adam until he re-emerges in the underground laboratories of the Initiative, killing Dr. Walsh's assistant and another soldier. He tells Riley that he knows Dr. Walsh created them both, that she gave Riley chemicals to strengthen him, which makes them brothers. When Riley refuses to acknowledge their bond, Adam skewers Riley, and knocks Buffy across the room while Forrest and Graham are trying to enter the locked door. Adam leaves and the Initiative are tasked with hunting him down and killing him.&lt;ref&gt;Holder, ''et al.'', pp. 231–232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson and Rabb, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; When one of Sunnydale's residents, [[Jonathan Levinson]] ([[Danny Strong]]), casts a spell making him the center of everyone's attention in "[[Superstar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Superstar]]", Adam is the only character in town who realizes it is an illusion. He explains his insight by saying he is "aware". His uniqueness has set him apart.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; Adam is interested in how the illusion will play out, however, and watches it unfold. During the illusion, Jonathan—temporarily a part of the Inititative—discovers Adam's only weakness: a uranium power core source which, effectively, will never allow him to die.&lt;ref&gt;Holder, ''et al.'', pp. 237–238&lt;/ref&gt;

Spike simultaneously discovers Adam to be communicating with the town's demon underworld, asking for favors through a charisma he has over them. Adam promises if Spike can drive apart Buffy and Riley and their friends, he will remove Spike's microchip.&lt;ref&gt;Holder, ''et al.'', pp. 239–244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="s242"&gt;Stafford, pp. 239–242&lt;/ref&gt; The plan to drive Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles apart works for a while; at their lowest, the four refuse to speak to each other, but each of them realizes in "[[Primeval (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Primeval]]" that they were manipulated by Spike and return, apologetic. They realize that Adam has been orchestrating the capture of the town's vampires and demons so he can release them in the Initiative; the Initiative's holding cells are becoming overcrowded and the soldiers spread very thin and overworked. The soldiers and demons will then proceed to kill each other. Adam then intends to use the resulting carnage to create an army of monsters much like himself.&lt;ref name=holderprimeval&gt;Holder, ''et al.'', pp. 246–247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=staffordprimeval&gt;Stafford, pp. 242–244&lt;/ref&gt;

Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles realize they must work as one unit to defeat Adam. They are captured sneaking into the Initiative, but Adam trips the power, releasing all the demons and a fight breaks out all over the facility. Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles get themselves into a room adjacent to 314 as Willow starts to cast the spell to join them all temporarily. Riley distracts Adam's demonoid minions while Buffy confronts Adam. However, Adam, after modulating his arm to dispense a [[minigun]], is able to overpower her. Suddenly, the spell begins to work: to function as one unit, Willow becomes the spirit, Giles the mind, Xander the heart, and Buffy the hand, or strength of their ensemble. They work through Buffy to neutralize Adam, telling him "You could never hope to grasp the source of our power". Adam, alone but intrigued, shoots at them to no avail. Adam then shoots a missile, which is changed into doves, and his gun is reverted into his arm. They are able, through Buffy, to punch inside Adam's chest, remove his uranium core, destroying him.&lt;ref name=richardson73&gt;Richardson and Rabb, pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam's most significant influence following his death is in the next episode "[[Restless (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Restless]]", where the cost of defeating Adam is made apparent. ''Buffy'''s fourth season was a first in the series in that the Scoobies' defeat of the Big Bad did not occur in a two-part grand season finale. "Primeval" is not the last episode of the season. Joss Whedon felt so strongly about the importance of the four core characters that he dedicated the finale to exploring their development.&lt;ref name=fourthoverview/&gt; "Restless" opens with Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles arriving at Buffy's mother's house still brimming with the energy of the spell that bound them together in "Primeval". Each of them falls asleep quickly, however, and their dreams are a pastiche of enigmatic episodes that both reveal much about each character, but also foreshadow what will occur in seasons to come. Their dreams also mirror their roles in the spell they performed to kill Adam. The magic they used to defeat the influence of science creates an inverse crisis, violating the series' set of laws.&lt;ref name=richardson73/&gt; Both Riley and Adam, now only in human form, appear in Buffy's dream. They are wearing business suits, sitting together at a glass conference table as Buffy walks into the room, telling her they are naming things—as [[Adam]] did in the [[Garden of Eden]]—and making plans to take over the world. Buffy asks Adam what his name was before he was a monster, but he cannot tell her. Adam appears once more in the series as one of the faces of the [[First Evil]], the seventh season's Big Bad, in "[[Lessons (Buffy episode)|Lessons]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ruditis, pp. 167–170&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphic novel appearance===
According to the comic book series ''[[Haunted (Buffy comic)|Haunted]]'', Adam was once a human member of the Initiative tasked with protecting Professor Walsh. The ghost of [[Mayor (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]], however, took over the body of a vampire, which was then captured by the Initiative. Desperate to escape, the Mayor moved to the body of a dead demon and killed Adam. Having been one of her favorite agents, Professor Walsh vowed to bring him back to life and placed his body in her 314 Project.&lt;ref name="comicbook"&gt;Espenson, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the [[Buffyverse canon|complex nature of the Buffyverse]], this chain of events may not, in fact, be canonical.&lt;ref name=silverbullet&gt;{{cite web|last=Naso|first=Markisan|title=Jeff Mariotte: Cursed|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/110791695145851.htm|publisher=Silver Bullet Comicbooks|accessdate=2 June 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807070912/http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/110791695145851.htm|archivedate=7 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Series writer [[David Fury]] cited graphic novel author [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[Promethea]]''—a story combining science fiction, mysticism, and a female superhero—as inspiration for the storyline, and another nod to ''Frankenstein'' as its original title was ''Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus''.&lt;ref name=fourthoverview/&gt;&lt;ref name=wilcox133/&gt; In addition, series creator, Joss Whedon has long been interested in [[science fiction]]. He wrote the script for the film ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' (1997), where an extraterrestrial creature is bred from a human and an alien in a laboratory, and went on to develop the [[space western]] television series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''. ''Buffy'' uses both science and magic as narrative devices. According to author Andrew Aberdein, the series employs science in three ways: to demonstrate what contemporary science explains, to posit what science may be able to accomplish, and the dominance of supernatural forces over science. According to Aberdein, Adam, a "kinematically redundant, bio-mechanical demonoid", is the series' deepest exploration of scientific potential.&lt;ref&gt;South, pp. 79–90&lt;/ref&gt; Series writer [[Doug Petrie]] states that Adam is the embodiment of the invasion of science in a world where magic is the most powerful force. The series relied on its own form of magic to explain Buffy's superpowers and other supernatural occurrences up to the fourth season. Adam is "what happens when people who believe in science use demons for military gain", according to Petrie. The result is that science "gets its ass kicked" by magic.&lt;ref name=fourthoverview/&gt;

''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' had been very successful in its first three seasons on television, but some of the characters left the series and storylines ended, creating a need for an entire shift in location and mission. Buffy and the core group of friends who fight with her graduate from high school, while the school itself was blown up in the third-season finale. The fourth season, therefore, presents viewers with Buffy, her best friends [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]), [[Xander Harris|Xander]] ([[Nicholas Brendon]]), and mentor [[Rupert Giles|Giles]] ([[Anthony Head]]) at a crossroads. Series creator [[Joss Whedon]] called it a "strange, sort of schizophrenic season" with a "weird incoherence", but also stated that the episodes in the fourth season were among the series' best. The writers set out to explore the characters' trials as they discover more about themselves following the defining years of high school. Although they had been a cohesive group of friends in the first three seasons, situations arise in the fourth to separate them. The writers focused on each of the four core characters individually throughout the season to increase the impact of their finally coming back together in the penultimate episode, "[[Primeval (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Primeval]]", when they merge their essences to form a super-Buffy in order to defeat Adam.&lt;ref name="fourthoverview"&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Joss Whedon]] |date=2000 |title=Fourth Season Overview |medium= DVD |location=''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 4)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer Fourth Season]]'' |publisher=[[The WB Television Network]]|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:George Hertzberg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Actor [[George Hertzberg]] portrayed Adam in the series.]]
[[George Hertzberg]], a [[University of Southern California]] graduate with experience in sitcoms and commercials, was chosen based on one of Adam's monologues he was given to read for the audition. Hertzberg counted luck and being in the right place at the right time in helping him get the role. Many recurring characters on ''Buffy'' start with one or two episodes, and when the writers or producers like their chemistry with other actors, they often make them a regular part of the cast. Hertzberg, however, understood at his reading that Adam was to be a major part of the fourth season.&lt;ref&gt;Holder, ''et al.'', pp. 305–307&lt;/ref&gt; Casting Director Amy Britt needed someone physically imposing for the part, with the {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m|adj=on}} Hertzberg fitting the bill. Britt stated, "this is a guy we're going to want eventually to have some affinity for. We can't just see him as an evil being. He is evil to the core [and] should scare us with his actions; but there's also innocence. Like the Frankenstein monster, you realize that they're only doing what they know. Or what they've been programmed to do. These aren't born creatures, these are creations."&lt;ref&gt;Holder, ''et al.'', p. 347&lt;/ref&gt;

===Make-up===
When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no idea what Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. ''Buffy'' used a company named Optic Nerve to build the materials to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a [[Floppy disk|floppy disk drive]] mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Holder, ''et al.'', pp. 380–384&lt;/ref&gt; Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.&lt;ref&gt;Hertzberg, George.

==Themes==
[[File:Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff).jpg|thumb|200px|left|Adam serves as an allusion to [[Frankenstein's monster]].]]
[[Buffy studies]] scholar Roz Kaveney states that estrangement from the self and others is the primary theme of the fourth season. To illustrate the absolute search for identity, the series writers created Adam, who is more truly alone than is anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;Kaveney, pp. 23–27&lt;/ref&gt; He is a creature assembled from a man, vampires, demons, and cutting edge cybernetic technology. Adam was not the first re-animated corpse to be presented in the series. "[[Some Assembly Required (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Some Assembly Required]]" in the second season also had a Frankenstein monster-like creation and "[[Beauty and the Beasts]]" in the third includes references to ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]''; both touch on the misuse or abuse of science.&lt;ref&gt;Golden and Holder, pp. 83–85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holder, ''et al.'', pp. 147–149&lt;/ref&gt; Adam is a clear reference to [[Frankenstein's monster]], who in the novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818) tells his creator that he is the "Adam of your labours". [[Mary Shelley]] wrote the novel to highlight the problems progress, science, and industry create for humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the action, the monster constantly asks what he is and why he was created. Likewise, Adam escapes from 314 and makes his way out into the world, and much like Frankenstein's monster, he finds a little boy and asks the boy who and what he (Adam) is, then murders and dissects him. Adam is a curious character, seeking the truth and pontificating on what he has learned, even if he gained the knowledge through heartless violence. Whedon wanted Adam to be inquisitive and introspective, directing George Hertzberg to "find the stillness" in the character. Roz Kaveney notes that Hertzberg's "flawed but impressive performance" includes Adam's interesting idiosyncrasy of pausing each time he speaks, as if he is creating meaning with his own words and must consider the implications of what he is saying.&lt;ref&gt;Kaveney, pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt; Author Nikki Stafford connects Adam's need to learn about the world around him to Frankenstein's monster: Adam must understand why other people are here and why he has emotions, a peculiarity of his creation as Dr. Walsh never encouraged others to question her.&lt;ref&gt;Stafford, pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt; One Buffy studies writer draws comparisons between Dr. Walsh and [[Victor Frankenstein]], both of whom build monsters out of body parts "to compensate for human vulnerability".&lt;ref&gt;South, pp. 91–93&lt;/ref&gt; The moral of Shelley's novel is that what science can accomplish is not necessarily what it should.&lt;ref name=wilcox133&gt;Wilcox and Lavery, pp. 133–142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dial67&gt;Dial-Driver, pp. 67–69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Questioning tradition and authority, specifically institutional authority, is a repeated theme on the show. Buffy was created to subvert the media trope of a young, petite girl who easily falls prey to a male monster. Resisting [[patriarchy]] is exhibited in Buffy's opposing the first season's [[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Master]] ([[Mark Metcalf]]), the leader of a cult determined to cause the apocalypse, and again in the third season where exploring the issues of power and its abuse is a primary theme. Buffy opposes Sunnydale's secretly evil [[Mayor (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor]] ([[Harry Groener]]), who is planning to transform into a giant demon and feed on the graduating class of Sunnydale High School. The military-industrial complex is at the heart of the authority question in season four, again drawing comparisons to ''Frankenstein''. Where Frankenstein's monster had no parental love, Adam has a "design flaw". Unlike Frankenstein's monster, who needs his creator to make him a mate, Adam supplants Dr. Walsh's existence with technology, finding her unnecessary and thus he kills her. Adam is the embodiment of the lack of moral guidance in pursuing scientific and technological advancement. He represents the cannibalistic nature of relentless and unchecked power: what that power wreaks comes back to devour its source.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, pp. 130–134&lt;/ref&gt; ''Buffy'', however, subverts Shelley's novel in the way Adam is defeated. Both Frankenstein and the monster must suffer alone. ''Frankenstein'' itself is an inversion of the [[Romantic era]] ideal of a solitary hero who must endure struggles, by portraying the monster and its creator as isolated and miserable. Buffy, as the embodiment of the postfeminist [[Romantic hero]], further subverts this because the source of her success, according to Anita Rose, is that she fights with friends. Only then is she able to defeat Adam.&lt;ref name=wilcox133/&gt;

==Reception==
Critical reception to Adam was largely mixed, with critics' opinions ranging from negative to positive. Nikki Stafford, in her book ''Bite Me!: The 10th Buffyversary Guide to the World of Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', was critical of Adam as well as the series doing several Frankenstein-inspired episodes so close together, noting that "Some Assembly Required" was aired "just two seasons" prior.&lt;ref name="s231"/&gt; Stafford called the entire ending sequence of "[[Primeval (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Primeval]]", which featured the reanimated corpses of several minor characters as well as the death of Adam, "stupid and disgusting" and wrote that the scene was a main reason she was "happily bidding adieu" to the plot involving Adam and the Initiative.&lt;ref name="s242"/&gt; Jenna Busch, in her book ''Joss Whedon: The Complete Companion'', called Adam "one of ''Buffy'''s least interesting Big Bads" and argued that his story-arc involving the Initiative was "rather unconvincing and somewhat off-putting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Busch|first=Jenna|title='Joss Whedon: The Complete Companion': Read an excerpt now|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/pop2it/2012/04/joss-whedon-the-complete-companion-read-an-excerpt-now.html|publisher=Zap2It|accessdate=2 June 2012|date=26 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626053600/http://blog.zap2it.com/pop2it/2012/04/joss-whedon-the-complete-companion-read-an-excerpt-now.html|archivedate=26 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviews were more accepting of the character. Noel Murray from ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' was slightly more positive towards the concept of Adam. He wrote that he "love[d] the idea of Adam" but was having a hard time understanding the coherence of his application to the main plot. He cited inconsistencies in Adam's existence, noting, "Adam killed Professor Walsh weeks ago, and yet The Initiative is still fully operational, and no one seems overly bothered by the fact that one of their leaders was building a monster."&lt;ref name=avclubyoko&gt;{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Noel|title='The Yoko Factor' etc.|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/superstar-etc,32290/|publisher=''[[The A.V. Club]]''|accessdate=2 June 2012|date=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray, however, did conclude that the show's writers and producers "did a decent job of bringing [the plot involving Adam] to a conclusion".&lt;ref name=avclubyoko/&gt; Despite critiquing the larger plot, Murray was "always impressed with [Adam's] costume/make-up".&lt;ref name=avclubsuper/&gt; Furthermore, he was positively surprised that it "took [him] a minute to recognize" Adam's appearance in "Restless" sans makeup.&lt;ref name=avclubsuper&gt;{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Noel|title='Superstar' etc.|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/superstar-etc,32290/|publisher=''[[The A.V.

==Diving==
In the effort coordinated by [[Victorian Speleological Association]] in 2009, she and James Arundale explored Elk River streamway cave system by an additional {{convert|1400|m}}, which has potential to become the longest continuous stream passage in Victoria, Australia.&lt;ref name=CEGSA552&gt;{{cite web|author=CEGSA News |title=Past Trips From General Meetings |publisher=Cave Exploration Group (South Australia) |url=http://www.cegsa.org.au/NEWS/V55n2.pdf |accessdate=15 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001070556/http://www.cegsa.org.au/NEWS/V55n2.pdf |archivedate=1 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 expedition near [[Cocklebiddy, Western Australia|Cocklebiddy]], she reached the midpoint of [[Craig Challen]]’s 2008 line giving her the record for the longest cave dive in Australia for a female.&lt;ref name=CCDH&gt;{{cite web|first1=Tony|last1=Richardson|first2=Chris|last2=Brown|title=Cocklebiddy Cave Diving History|publisher=Cave Divers Association of Australia|url=http://www.cavedivers.com.au/sites/default/files/finder/history/Cocklebiddy%20Cave%20Diving%20History.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked as an underwater [[Grip (job)|grip]] in 2008 for a film by Discovery Channel Japan, "Water's Journey" by TV Asahi &amp; Karst Productions. She was part of the National Geographic Nova TV Special expedition to [[Blue Hole]]s of the Bahamas, in December 2008, as an underwater grip,&lt;ref name="NSSCDS37"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nsscds.org/test/drupal/content/%E2%80%9Chi-warg-mug-hi%E2%80%9D| title=Hi Warg Mug Hi| accessdate=12 September 2011 |first=Brian| last=Kakuk| newspaper=Underwater Speleology, Volume 37 Number 4| date=Oct 2010| publisher=National Speleological Society Cave Diving Section}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the expedition to look for similar [[sinkholes]] in Queensland, Australia in October 2009.&lt;ref name=BlueHolesQueensland&gt;{{cite web|author=Sydney Project Dive Team|title=Technically Speaking: Blue Holes Exploration Trip|publisher=Sydney Project|url=http://www.sydneyproject.com/stories/technically-speaking/32-technically-speaking-blue-holes-exploration-trip.html|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, when living in Florida, she laid over {{convert|4000|m}} of line across a number of cave systems, the most significant of which was Mission Spring. In August 2010, together with James Toland, she made the connection between Peacock Springs and Baptizing Spring, Florida adding over {{convert|3000|m}} of passage.  She was the presenter and editor for TV series "Agnes Milowka Project" (2010) featuring underwater cave footage shot by [[Wes Skiles]], [[Karst Productions]].

Agnes Milowka was a speaker at a number of diving related conferences ([[OZTek]] 2009, [[EuroTek]] 2010). She acted as a [[stunt double]] for two female characters on the [[James Cameron]]-produced feature film ''[[Sanctum (film)|Sanctum]]'' (2011) and worked during the production as cave dive instructor to the actors.  In 2011 she was nominated as Dive Rite Ambassador.  One of her last jobs was as a diving supervisor on ''BIRTH'', a short film for the TRIMÄPEE fashion label.  The movie has been dedicated in her name.

==Death==
In February 2011, she ran out of air and died after parting company to explore a tight restriction, which necessitated going solo,&lt;ref name=deepbluedive&gt;{{cite news|last=Holden |first=Adam |title=Dedicated cave diver perishes |url=http://blog.deepbluedive.com/2011/03/04/dedicated-cave-diver-perishes/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121205160543/http://blog.deepbluedive.com/2011/03/04/dedicated-cave-diver-perishes/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 December 2012 |accessdate=18 July 2011 |newspaper=Deep Blue Dive Magazine |date=4 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Tank Cave near [[Tantanoola, South Australia|Tantanoola]] in the south east of [[South Australia]].&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{cite news|last=Kappelle|first=Liza|title=Underwater caves a passion for lost diver|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/underwater-caves-a-passion-for-lost-diver-20110228-1bbec.html|accessdate=2 March 2011|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of Milowka's achievements and legacy, The Agnes Milowka Memorial Environmental Science Award has been established by Mummu Media for underprivileged schools in the area of science, marine studies or exploration.

'''Aleksey Vladimirovich Batalov''' ({{lang-ru|Алексе́й Влади́мирович Бата́лов}}; 20 November 1928 – 15 June 2017&lt;ref&gt;[http://kinoacademy.ru/page/list-members Cписок членов Национальной Академии кинематографических искусств и наук России].&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[USSR|Soviet]] and [[Russia]]n actor acclaimed for his portrayal of noble and positive characters. He was named a [[People's Artist of the USSR]] in 1976 and a [[Hero of Socialist Labour]] in 1989.

==Life and career==
Batalov was born on 20 November 1928 in [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], into a family associated with the theatre. His uncle Nikolay Batalov starred in [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]]'s classic ''Mother'' (1926). Modernist poet [[Anna Akhmatova]] was a family friend, and he painted a well-known portrait of her in 1952. Batalov joined the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] in 1953 but left three years later to concentrate on his career in film. During the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] he was one of the most recognizable actors in the [[Soviet Union]]. ''[[The Cranes Are Flying]]'' (1957) is his best-regarded film of the period, and the one which won [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].  He also starred in [[Mikhail Romm]]'s ''[[Nine Days of One Year]]'' (1962). In 1967 he was a member of the jury of the [[5th Moscow International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Moscow1967"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1967 |title=5th Moscow International Film Festival (1967) |accessdate=9 December 2012 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116194759/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1967 |archivedate=16 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 he was a member of the jury at the [[8th Moscow International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Moscow1973"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1973 |title=8th Moscow International Film Festival (1973) |accessdate=25 December 2012 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116194922/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1973 |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s, Batalov became known for his fastidious approach towards choosing roles for himself. He appeared mostly in film adaptations of Russian classics, including [[Anton Chekhov]]'s '' [[The Lady with the Dog (film) |The Lady with the Dog]]'' (1960) and [[Bulgakov]]'s '' [[The Flight (film)|The Flight]]'' (1970). He also directed screen versions of [[Gogol]]'s ''[[The Overcoat]]'' (1960) and [[Yuri Olesha]]'s ''Three Fat Men'' (1966). In the 1970s he concentrated on professorship at the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]].

In 1979 Batalov was invited to play Gosha, a mill machinist, in the melodrama ''[[Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears]]''. After many hesitations, Batalov brilliantly played his part in the movie, which won him the [[USSR State Prize]]. The role was central to the film's Soviet message. As one character says in the picnic scene: "Seventy percent of my doctorate was due to Gosha's mechanical genius". After that, he effectively retired from acting and devoted his time to coaching new generations of film actors. [[Boris Yeltsin]] presented the Lifetime Achievement [[Nika Award]] to him in 2002. Batalov was awarded the [[State Prize of the Russian Federation]] (2005).

In 2007 he received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the [[29th Moscow International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Moscow2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2007 |title=29th Moscow International Film Festival (2007) |accessdate=30 May 2013 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421051129/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2007 |archivedate=21 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014 he signed a letter in support of the position of the President of Russia [[Vladimir Putin]] on [[2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|Russia's military intervention in Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.glavcom.ua/news/170894-rossijskie-artisty-podderzhali-agressiju-putina-protiv-ukrainy-spisok.html Russian artists supported Putin's aggression against Ukraine (LIST)], [[Glavkom]] (11 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Деятели культуры России — в поддержку позиции Президента по Украине и Крыму|url=http://mkrf.ru/press-tsentr/novosti/ministerstvo/deyateli-kultury-rossii-v-podderzhku-pozitsii-prezidenta-po-ukraine-i-krymu|publisher=Ministry for Culture of [[Russian Federation]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140311194202/mkrf.ru/press-tsentr/novosti/ministerstvo/deyateli-kultury-rossii-v-podderzhku-pozitsii-prezidenta-po-ukraine-i-krymu|archivedate=11 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Batalov died on 15 June 2017 in [[Moscow]] from complications of a fall, which resulted in a hip fracture, at the age of 88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://altapress.ru/story/v-moskve-skonchalsya-znamenitiy-akter-aleksey-batalov-203288|title=В Москве скончался знаменитый актер Алексей Баталов|publisher=Altapress.ru|accessdate=15 June 2017|date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Banks of the Ohio'''",&lt;ref&gt;[[George Malcolm Laws|Laws]] F5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roud Folk Song Index|Roud]] 157&lt;/ref&gt; also known as "'''Down on the Banks of the Ohio'''", is a 19th-century [[murder ballad]], written by unknown authors, in which "Willie" invites his young lover for a walk during which she rejects his marriage proposal. Once they are alone on the river bank, he murders the young woman.

==Background==
The song is superficially similar to other [[murder ballad]]s in the idiom such as [[Omie Wise]] and more especially  [[Pretty Polly (ballad)|Pretty Polly]], which is also generally narrated in the first person by a killer called Willie. However, it differs significantly in the narrative; the killer explains why he killed his love, and spends much of the song expressing his sorrow and regret. Musically, it is distinguished by a long [[refrain]] which calmly reflects the love and the  hopes for the future which he felt before the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/banks-of-the-ohio-lyrics-johnny-cash.html |title=Banks of the Ohio - Johnny Cash |website=metrolyrics.com |accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives a different psychological tone to the song, and accompanying singers (or indeed the audience) the possibility of singing along in chorus.

Another not so well known version of the song is entitled "On the Banks of the Old Pedee".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KSrw1TaEJEAC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;lpg=PA265&amp;dq=%22On+the+Banks+of+the+Old+Pedee%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uC2ZPQ5JbW&amp;sig=G2jGFexLD01SJs4KihhsbpA93Uc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QiycU_maCoWsO9vngOAN&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22On%20the%20Banks%20of%20the%20Old%20Pedee%22&amp;f=false books.google.co.uk - On the Banks of the Old Pedee]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lyrics are sometimes adapted for a female singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://genius.com/Dolly-parton-banks-of-the-ohio-lyrics |title=Banks of the Ohio - Dolly Parton |website=genius.com |accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
Commercial [[country music]] recordings started in 1927 with versions by Red Patterson's Piedmont Log Rollers (as "Down By The Banks Of The Ohio") and by [[G. B. Grayson|Grayson]] and [[Henry Whitter|Whitter]] (as "I'll Never Be Yours"). Other early country music stars who recorded the song included [[Ernest Stoneman]] (1928), The Callahan Brothers (1934),  [[The Blue Sky Boys]] (1936), [[Clayton McMichen]] (1931) and  [[Bill Monroe|The Monroe Brothers]] (1936). The Blue Sky Boys version appears in the soundtrack of the 1973 film ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]''.

The song was recorded for the [[American folk music revival]] market by [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]] (1953) and  by the traditional singer Ruby Vass on a 1959 [[field recording]] made by [[Alan Lomax]] and issued on the LP (and subsequent CD) series ''Southern Journey''. It was recorded several times by [[Joan Baez]]: in 1959 as the opening track for the album ''[[Folksingers 'Round Harvard Square]]''; in 1961 in her album ''[[Joan Baez, Vol. 2]]''; on the 1968 [[Newport Folk Festival]] album; and other recordings.  It was included on the 2011 CD compilation ''Voice of the People''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joanbaez.com/discsa.html |title=The Joan Baez Web Pages |publisher=Joanbaez.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Lomax made a further field recording in 1961 at his New York City apartment,  featuring veteran singer [[Clarence Ashley]], accompanied by Fred Price (fiddle), and Clint Howard and [[Doc Watson]] (guitars). The recording, filmed by George Pickow and with sound by Jean Ritchie, was later used by [[Anna Lomax Wood]] for the short film ''Ballads, Blues and Bluegrass''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cld0f8ooXcg |title=Clarence Ashley with Doc Watson: The Banks of the Ohio (1961) |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-06-11 |accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another recording by this group was issued on ''Old Time Music at Clarence Ashley's'' reissued as [[Original Folkways Recordings: 1960–1962]] (1994).  Also for Folkways, Doc Watson performed the song as a duet with [[Bill Monroe]] in 1963.

Other folk revival artist who recorded the song included the  [[New Lost City Ramblers]] and [[Pete Seeger]]. Artists who returned the song to country music audiences included [[Johnny Cash]] with [[The Carter Family]],  [[Porter Wagoner]] and [[Dolly Parton]]. Other recording were made by [[The Wolfe Tones]], [[Arlo Guthrie]] (as "Arloff Boguslavaki," on the 1972 [[Earl Scruggs]] album ''I Saw the Light''), [[Dave Guard]] and the [[Whiskeyhill Singers]], Mike Ireland and Holler,  [[Gangstagrass]] featuring Alexa Dirks also giving a faithful rendition on their 2014 album ''Broken Hearts and Stolen Money''.

[[Olivia Newton-John]] recorded an arrangement of the song by [[Marvin, Welch &amp; Farrar|John Farrar and Bruce Welch]] in 1971, for her album ''[[If Not for You (album)|If Not for You]]''. It was released as the second single from the album  and was successful in the UK, peaking at number six. It was her first number one hit in Australia&lt;ref name="go-setbanks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poparchives.com.au/gosetcharts/1971/19710612.html|title=Pop Archives: Go-Set National Top 60 (June 12, 1971)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reached number 9 in South Africa &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rock.co.za/files/sa_charts_1969_1989_songs_(A-B).html&lt;/ref&gt; but failed to reach the top forty in Canada and the US, peaking at number sixty-six and ninety-four, respectively.&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Viglione|first=Joe|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/if-not-for-you-mw0000739358|title= Olivia Newton-John – ''If Not for You''|publisher=[[Allmusic]].

Tony Rice recorded the song on his [[Tony Rice (album)|eponymous 1977 album]]. 
A [[Swedish language|Swedish]] version, recorded by [[Ann-Louise Hanson]], is entitled "Tag emot en utsträckt hand".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lennart Ljung|title=Ann-Louise Hanson - Tag emot en utsträckt hand (1990)|date=2015-08-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dELufo4cX18|accessdate=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song appears, and gives the title for, the 2013 album ''Oh, Willie, Please...'' a collection of folk murder ballads, by [[Indie folk|alt-folk]] musical project [[Vandaveer]]. The band made a live [[Gramophone record|78 acetate recording]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtMJvKt4SJQ |title=Vandaveer - Oh Willie Please (New Album) - PledgeMusic Launch Video |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-04-22 |accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=from The 78 Project PRO 2 years ago Not Yet Rated |url=http://vimeo.com/38776953 |title=The 78 Project: Vandaveer - "Banks of the Ohio" on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=2012-03-19 |accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The song and its title served as the theme song for, and title of, a long-running radio series broadcast of [[bluegrass music]] on [[WAMU]]-[[PBS]] and Bluegrass Country, hosted by Fred Bartenstein and produced for the [[International Bluegrass Music Museum]], near the [[Ohio River]] in [[Owensboro, Kentucky]].

This allowed him to develop an intimate singing style that influenced many male singers who followed him, including [[Perry Como]],{{sfn |Gilliland |1994 |loc=cassette 1, side B}} [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dick Haymes]], and [[Dean Martin]]. ''Yank'' magazine said that he was the person who had done the most for American soldiers' morale during [[World War II]]. In 1948, American polls declared him the "most admired man alive", ahead of [[Jackie Robinson]] and [[Pope Pius XII]].&lt;ref name="Giddins2001" /&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name="crooner"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoffman |first=Dr. Frank |title=Crooner |url=http://www.jeffosretromusic.com/bing.html |accessdate=December 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311095040/http://www.jeffosretromusic.com/bing.html |archivedate=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1948, ''Music Digest'' estimated that his recordings filled more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours allocated to recorded radio music.&lt;ref name="crooner"/&gt;

Crosby won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his role as Father Chuck O'Malley in the 1944 motion picture ''[[Going My Way]]'' and was nominated for his reprise of the role in ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' opposite [[Ingrid Bergman]] the next year, becoming the first of six actors to be nominated twice for playing the same character. In 1963, Crosby received the first [[Grammy Award|Grammy Global Achievement Award]].&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tapley |first=Krostopher |title=Sylvester Stallone Could Join Exclusive Oscar Company with 'Creed' Nomination |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=December 10, 2015 |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/in-contention/sylvester-stallone-oscars-golden-globes-1201657048/ |accessdate=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of 33 people to have three stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/#most-stars|title=About – Hollywood Star Walk – Los Angeles Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the categories of motion pictures, radio, and audio recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/bing-crosby|title=Bing Crosby – Hollywood Walk of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known for his collaborations with longtime friend Bob Hope, starring in the ''[[Road to...]]'' films from 1940 to 1962.

Crosby influenced the development of the postwar [[recording industry]]. After seeing a demonstration of an early Ampex [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape recorder]], he placed a large order for their equipment and convinced ABC to allow him to tape his shows. He became the first performer to pre-record his radio shows and master his commercial recordings onto [[magnetic tape]]. Through the medium of recording, he constructed his radio programs with the same directorial tools and craftsmanship (editing, retaking, rehearsal, [[time shifting]]) used in motion picture production, a practice that became an industry standard. In addition to his work with early audio tape recording, he helped to finance the development of videotape, bought television stations, bred racehorses, and co-owned the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team.

==Early life==
[[File:Bing Crosby - Radio Mirror, February 1935.jpg|thumb|upright|Crosby aged nine]]
Crosby was born on May 3, 1903&lt;ref name=Grudens&gt;Grudens, 2002, p. 236. "Bing was born on May 3, 1903.

It functions today as a museum housing over 200 artifacts from his life and career, including his Oscar.&lt;ref name="House"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bing Crosby House Museum |url=https://www.gonzaga.edu/student-life/arts-culture/crosby-museum |website=www.gonzaga.edu |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Bing Crosby and Gonzaga University: 1903–1925 |url=http://www.gonzaga.edu/academics/libraries/foley-library/departments/special-collections/Collections/Bing-Crosby-Collection/CrosbyandGonzaga.asp |title=Bing Crosby and Gonzaga University: 1903–1925 – Gonzaga University |publisher=Gonzaga.edu |accessdate=October 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809141328/http://www.gonzaga.edu/Academics/Libraries/Foley-Library/Departments/Special-Collections/Collections/Bing-Crosby-Collection/CrosbyandGonzaga.asp |archivedate=August 9, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the fourth of seven children: brothers [[Larry Crosby|Larry]] (1895–1975), Edward (1896–1966), Ted (1900–1973), and [[Bob Crosby|Bob]] (1913–1993); and two sisters, Catherine (1904–1974) and Mary Rose (1906–1990). His parents were Harry Lillis Crosby Sr.&lt;ref name="PBS Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bing Crosby ~ Timeline: Bing Crosby's Life and Career |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/bing-crosby/timeline-bing-crosbys-life-and-career/3501/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201010101/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/bing-crosby/timeline-bing-crosbys-life-and-career/3501/|website=American Masters – PBS|accessdate=December 3, 2014|dead-url=yes|archivedate=December 1, 2014 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1870–1950), a bookkeeper, and Catherine Helen "Kate" (née Harrigan; 1873–1964).&lt;ref name="PBS Timeline" /&gt; His mother was a second generation Irish-American.&lt;ref name="PBS Timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Giddins2001" /&gt; His father was of English descent; an ancestor, Simon Crosby, emigrated to America in the 17th century.  The first Crosby in America was the English immigrant Simon Crosby, who was a [[Puritan]] from [[Cambridgeshire]], [[England]].  Through an entirely paternal line Bing Crosby is descended from Simon Crosby, who emigrated from [[England]] to [[New England]] in the 1630s during the [[Puritan migration to New England (1620–40)|Puritan migration to New England]].&lt;ref&gt;Her Heart Can See: The Life and Hymns of Fanny J.

Back Bay Books. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, 1937, after [[Lux Radio Theatre|Lux Radio Theatre's]] [[List of Lux Radio Theatre episodes#1937|adaptation]] of ''[[She Loves Me Not (1934 film)|She Loves Me Not]]'', [[Joan Blondell]] asked Crosby how he got his nickname:

Crosby: "Well, I'll tell you, back in the knee-britches day, when I was a wee little tyke, a mere broth of a lad, as we say in Spokane, I used to totter around the streets, with a gun on each hip, my favorite after school pastime was a game known as "[[Tag (game)#Cops and robbers|Cops and Robbers]]", I didn't care which side I was on, when a cop or robber came into view, I would haul out my trusty six-shooters, made of wood, and loudly exclaim ''bing''! ''bing''!, as my luckless victim fell clutching his side, I would shout ''bing''! ''bing''!, and I would let him have it again, and then as his friends came to his rescue, shooting as they came, I would shout ''bing''! ''bing''! ''bing''! ''bing''! ''bing''! ''bing''! ''bing''! ''bing''!"&lt;br /&gt;Blondell: "I'm surprised they didn't call you "Killer" Crosby! Now tell me another story, Grandpa!&lt;br /&gt;Crosby: "No, so help me, it's the truth, ask Mister De Mille."&lt;br /&gt;De Mille: "I'll vouch for it, Bing."&lt;ref name="Loves"&gt;{{cite web |title=She Loves Me Not, starring Bing Crosby and Nan Grey |url=https://free-classic-radio-shows.com/Drama/Lux-Radio-Theater/1935-1939/1937-11-08-She-Loves-Me-Not-w-Bing-Crosby-and-Nan-Grey/index.php |website=free-classic-radio-shows.com |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Robert |title=Times Past Old Time Radio : Lux Radio Theater |url=http://otrarchive.blogspot.com/2009/07/lux-radio-theater.html |website=Times Past Old Time Radio |accessdate=5 July 2018 |date=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldin"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goldin |first1=J.

In 1917, Crosby took a summer job as property boy at Spokane's "Auditorium," where he witnessed some of the finest acts of the day, including [[Al Jolson]], who held him spellbound with ad libbing and parodies of [[Hawaiian music|Hawaiian songs]]. He later described Jolson's delivery as "electric."{{sfn |Gilliland |1994 |loc=cassette 3, side B}}

Crosby graduated from Gonzaga High School (today's [[Gonzaga Preparatory School|Gonzaga Prep]]) in 1920 and enrolled at Gonzaga University. He attended Gonzaga for three years but did not earn a degree.&lt;ref name=hlogozu&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=8097 |title=Gonzaga University |last=Kershner |first=Jim |publisher=HistoryLink.org |agency=Essay 8097 |date=February 21, 2007 |accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a freshman, he played on the university's baseball team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gonzaga.edu/academics/libraries/foley+library/departments/Special-Collections/Collections/Bing-Crosby-Collection/CrosbyandGonzaga.asp |title=Bing Crosby and Gonzaga University: 1903–1925 |publisher=Gonzaga University, via Internet Archive |accessdate=November 24, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150429161408/http://www.gonzaga.edu/academics/libraries/foley%2Blibrary/Departments/Special-Collections/Collections/Bing-Crosby-Collection/CrosbyandGonzaga.asp |archivedate=April 29, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university granted him an honorary doctorate in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HrwzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GfUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4125%2C5113321 |newspaper=[[Spokane Daily Chronicle]] |title=Bing Crosby comes home to his Gonzaga |date=October 21, 1937 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance career==

===Early years===
In 1923, Crosby was invited to join a new band composed of high school students a few years younger than himself. [[Al Rinker]], Miles Rinker, James Heaton, Claire Pritchard and Robert Pritchard, along with drummer Crosby, formed the Musicaladers,&lt;ref name=bicrdha/&gt; who performed at dances both for high school students and club-goers. The group performed on Spokane radio station [[The Davenport Hotel (Spokane, Washington)|KHQ]], but disbanded after two years.&lt;ref name="Giddins2001" /&gt;{{rp|92–97}}&lt;ref&gt;[[The Davenport Hotel (Spokane, Washington)|Early KHQ broadcast from the Davenport Hotel Spokane]]&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby and Al Rinker then obtained work at the Clemmer Theatre in Spokane (now known as the [[Bing Crosby Theater]]). Crosby was initially a member of a vocal trio called 'The Three Harmony Aces' with Al Rinker accompanying on piano from the pit, to entertain between the films. Bing and Al continued at the Clemmer Theatre for several months often with three other men – Wee Georgie Crittenden, Frank McBride and Lloyd Grinnell – and they were billed The Clemmer Trio or The Clemmer Entertainers depending who performed.&lt;ref name="macfarlane2001"&gt;{{cite book|first=Malcolm|last=Macfarlane|title=Bing Crosby: Day by Day|year=2001 |url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/1903-1935.htm |website=Bingmagazine.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1925, Crosby and his partner Al Rinker, brother of singer [[Mildred Bailey]], decided to seek fame in California. They traveled to Los Angeles where they met Bailey. She introduced them to her show business contacts. The Fanchon and Marco Time Agency hired them for thirteen weeks for the revue ''The Syncopation Idea'' starting at the Boulevard Theater in Los Angeles and then on the Loew's circuit. They each earned $75 a week. As minor parts of ''The Syncopation Idea'' Crosby and Rinker started to develop as entertainers. They had a lively style that was popular with college students. After ''The Syncopation Idea closed'', they worked in the Will Morrissey Music Hall Revue. They honed their skills with Morrissey. When they got a chance to present an independent act, they were spotted by the [[Paul Whiteman]] organization. Whiteman needed something different to break up his musical selections, and Crosby and Rinker filled this requirement. After less than a year in show business, they were attached to one of the biggest names.&lt;ref name="macfarlane2001"/&gt; Hired for $150 a week in 1926, they debuted with Whiteman on December 6 at the [[Tivoli Theatre (Chicago)|Tivoli Theatre]] in Chicago. Their first recording, in October 1926, was "I've Got the Girl" with Don Clark's Orchestra, but the Columbia-issued record was inadvertently recorded at a slow speed, which increased the singers' pitch when played at 78&amp;nbsp;rpm. Throughout his career, Crosby often credited Bailey for getting him his first important job in the entertainment business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/rhythmboys.html |title=Paul Whiteman's Original Rhythm Boys |website=Redhotjazz.com |accessdate=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Rhythm Boys===
Success with Whiteman was followed by disaster when they reached New York. Whiteman considered letting them go. Crosby may have been retained, as Whiteman was already using him as a solo performer on record, but the prospects for Rinker were bleak. However, the addition of pianist and aspiring songwriter [[Harry Barris]] made the difference, and "[[The Rhythm Boys]]" were born. The additional voice meant they could be heard more easily in large New York theaters. Crosby gained valuable experience on tour for a year with Whiteman and performing and recording with [[Bix Beiderbecke]], [[Jack Teagarden]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Jimmy Dorsey]], [[Eddie Lang]], and [[Hoagy Carmichael]]. He matured as a performer and was in demand as a solo singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Macfarlane| first1=Malcolm |title=Bing Crosby – Day by Day| url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/1903-1935.htm#Chapter_3|website=BING magazine|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crosby became the star attraction of the Rhythm Boys. In 1928 he had his first number one hit, a jazz-influenced rendition of "[[Ol' Man River]]". In 1929, the Rhythm Boys appeared in the film ''[[The King of Jazz]]'' with Whiteman, but Crosby's growing dissatisfaction with Whiteman led to the Rhythm Boys leaving his organization. They joined the [[Gus Arnheim]] Orchestra, performing nightly in the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Coconut Grove]] of the Ambassador Hotel. Singing with the Arnheim Orchestra, Crosby's solos began to steal the show while the Rhythm Boys act gradually became redundant. Harry Barris wrote several of Crosby's hits, including "At Your Command", "[[I Surrender Dear]]", and "[[Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams (song)|Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams]]". When [[Mack Sennett]] signed Crosby to a solo recording contract in 1931, a break with the Rhythm Boys became almost inevitable. Crosby married [[Dixie Lee]] in September 1930. After a threat of divorce in March 1931, he applied himself to his career.

===Success as a solo singer===
[[File:Bing Crosby - Modern Screen, September 1932.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Crosby in 1932]]
On September 2, 1931, Crosby made his [[15 Minutes with Bing Crosby|solo radio debut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.radiohof.org/musicvariety/bingcrosby.html |title=Bing Crosby, Singer |publisher=Radio Hall of Fame |accessdate=September 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923002631/http://www.radiohof.org/musicvariety/bingcrosby.html |archivedate=September 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the end of the year, he signed with both [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] and [[CBS Radio]]. Doing a weekly 15-minute radio broadcast, Crosby became a hit.&lt;ref name="kl."&gt;{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3094/biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Out of Nowhere (Johnny Green song)|Out of Nowhere]]", "Just One More Chance", "[[At Your Command]]" and "[[I Found a Million Dollar Baby (in a Five and Ten Cent Store)]]" were among the best selling songs of 1931.&lt;ref name="kl." /&gt;

Ten of the top 50 songs of 1931 included Crosby with others or as a solo act. A "Battle of the Baritones" with singer [[Russ Columbo]] proved short-lived, replaced with the slogan "Bing Was King". Crosby played the lead in a series of [[I Surrender Dear (1931 film)|musical comedy short films]] for Mack Sennett, signed with Paramount, and starred in his first full-length film 1932's ''[[The Big Broadcast]]'' (1932), the first of 55 films in which he received top billing. He would appear in 79 pictures. He signed a contract with [[Jack Kapp]]'s new record company, [[Decca Records|Decca]], in late 1934.

His first commercial sponsor on radio was [[15 Minutes with Bing Crosby#Bing Crosby – The Cremo Singer|Cremo Cigars]] and his fame spread nationwide. After a long run in New York, he went back to Hollywood to film ''[[The Big Broadcast]]''. His appearances, records, and radio work substantially increased his impact. The success of his first film brought him a contract with Paramount, and he began a pattern of making three films a year. He led his radio show for Woodbury Soap for two seasons while his live appearances dwindled. His records produced hits during the Depression when sales were down. Audio engineer [[Steve Hoffman (audio engineer)|Steve Hoffman]] stated, "By the way, Bing actually saved the record business in 1934 when he agreed to support Decca founder Jack Kapp's crazy idea of lowering the price of singles from a dollar to 35 cents and getting a royalty for records sold instead of a flat fee. Bing's name and his artistry saved the recording industry. All the other artists signed to Decca after Bing did. Without him, Jack Kapp wouldn't have had a chance in hell of making Decca work and the Great Depression would have wiped out phonograph records for good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/bing-crosby-bing-his-legendary-years-hows-the-sound.153459/ |title=Bing Crosby- Bing! His Legendary Years How's the sound? &amp;#124; Steve Hoffman Music Forums |website=Forums.stevehoffman.tv |accessdate=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His social life was hectic. His first son [[Gary Crosby (actor)|Gary]] was born in 1933 with twin boys following in 1934. By 1936, he replaced his former boss, Paul Whiteman, as host of the weekly NBC radio program ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'', where he remained for the next ten years. ''[[Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day)]]'', with his trademark whistling, became his theme song and signature tune.

In 1936, Crosby exercised an option from Paramount to make a film out-of-house. He signed a one-film agreement with Columbia. Crosby wanted his friend [[Louis Armstrong]], who influenced his singing style, to appear in ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1936 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]'', a screen adaptation of ''The Peacock Feather''. He asked [[Harry Cohn]], but Cohn had no desire to pay for the flight or to meet Armstrong's "crude, mob-linked but devoted manager, [[Joe Glaser]]." Crosby threatened to leave the film and refused to discuss it anymore with Cohn. Armstrong's musical scenes, and comic dialogue improved his career. Crosby gave Armstrong equal billing with white co-stars. Armstrong starred as himself in many more films and appreciated Crosby's lack of racism, often thanking him in later years.&lt;ref name="Pennies"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pennies from Heaven (1936) |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/111407%7c111410/Pennies-from-Heaven.html|website=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crosby's vocal style helped take popular singing beyond the "[[belt (music)|belting]]" associated with [[Al Jolson]] and [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]], who had been obligated to reach the back seats in New York theaters without the aid of the microphone. As music critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] noted in ''The Great American Popular Singers'', something new had entered American music, a style that might be called "singing in American" with conversational ease. This new sound led to the popular epithet "[[crooner]]".

During the [[Second World War]], Crosby made live appearances before American troops who had been fighting in the [[European Theater of Operations|European Theater]]. He learned how to pronounce German from written scripts and read propaganda broadcasts intended for German forces. The nickname "Der Bingle" was common among Crosby's German listeners and came to be used by his English-speaking fans. In a poll of U.S. troops at the close of World War II, Crosby topped the list as the person who had done the most for G.I. morale, ahead of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], General [[Dwight Eisenhower]], and [[Bob Hope]].

The June 18, 1945, issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine stated, "America's number one star, Bing Crosby, has won more fans, made more money than any entertainer in history. Today he is a kind of national institution."&lt;ref name="Barnett"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barnett |first1=Lincoln |title=Bing Inc. |url=http://stevenlewis.info/crosby/LIFE%20OVERSEAS6-18-45.htm |website=stevenlewis.info |accessdate=5 July 2018 |date=18 June 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In all, 60,000,000 Crosby disks have been marketed since he made his first record in 1931. His biggest best seller is 'White Christmas', 2,000,000 impressions of which have been sold in the U.S. and 250,000 in Great Britain."&lt;ref name="Barnett" /&gt; "Nine out of ten singers and bandleaders listen to Crosby's broadcasts each Thursday night and follow his lead. The day after he sings a song over the air – any song – some 50,000 copies of it are sold throughout the U.S. Time and again Crosby has taken some new or unknown ballad, has given it what is known in trade circles as the 'big goose' and made it a hit single-handed and overnight...Precisely what the future holds for Crosby neither his family nor his friends can conjecture. He has achieved greater popularity, made more money, attracted vaster audiences than any other entertainer in history. And his star is still in the ascendant. His contract with Decca runs until 1955. His contract with Paramount runs until 1954. Records which he made ten years ago are selling better than ever before. The nation's appetite for Crosby's voice and personality appears insatiable. To soldiers overseas and to foreigners he has become a kind of symbol of America, of the amiable, humorous citizen of a free land. Crosby, however, seldom bothers to contemplate his future. For one thing, he enjoys hearing himself sing, and if ever a day should dawn when the public wearies of him, he will complacently go right on singing—to himself."&lt;ref name="Barnett" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Inc1945"&gt;{{cite book |author=Time Inc|title=LIFE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dUgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA17 | accessdate=19 November 2016 |date=18 June 1945|publisher=Time Inc|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest hit song of Crosby's career was his recording of [[Irving Berlin]]'s "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]", which he introduced on a Christmas Day radio broadcast in 1941. (A copy of the recording from the radio program is owned by the estate of Bing Crosby and was loaned to ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'' for their December 25, 2011, program.) The song then appeared in his movie ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' (1942). His record hit the charts on October 3, 1942, and rose to No.&amp;nbsp;1 on October 31, where it stayed for 11 weeks. A holiday perennial, the song was repeatedly re-released by Decca, charting another sixteen times. It topped the charts again in 1945 and a third time in January 1947. The song remains the bestselling single of all time.&lt;ref name="kl." /&gt; According to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', his recording of "White Christmas" has sold over 100 million copies around the world, with at least 50&amp;nbsp;million sales as singles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=[[Guinness Book of Records]] 2007| publisher=Guinness| isbn=978-1-904994-12-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His recording was so popular that he was obliged to re-record it in 1947 using the same musicians and backup singers; the original 1942 master had become damaged due to its frequent use in pressing additional singles. Although the two versions are similar, the 1947 recording is more familiar today.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In 1977, after Crosby died, the song was re-released and reached No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart.&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book|title=British Hit Singles &amp; Albums | publisher = Guinness | isbn = 1-904994-00-8 | page=126 |edition=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby was dismissive of his role in the song's success, saying "a jackdaw with a cleft palate could have sung it successfully."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[File:Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in Road to Bali.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Crosby with Bob Hope in ''Road to Bali'' (1952)]]
In the wake of a solid decade of headlining mainly smash hit musical comedy films in the 1930s, Crosby starred with Bob Hope and [[Dorothy Lamour]] in seven ''[[Road to]]'' musical comedies between 1940 and 1962, cementing Crosby and Hope as an on-and-off duo, despite never officially declaring themselves a "team" in the sense that [[Laurel and Hardy]] or [[Martin and Lewis]] ([[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]]) were teams. The series consists of ''[[Road to Singapore]]'' (1940), ''[[Road to Zanzibar]]'' (1941), ''[[Road to Morocco]]'' (1942), ''[[Road to Utopia]]'' (1946), ''[[Road to Rio]]'' (1947), ''[[Road to Bali]]'' (1952), and ''[[The Road to Hong Kong]]'' (1962). When they appeared solo, Crosby and Hope frequently made note of the other in a comically insulting fashion. They performed together countless times on stage, radio, film,  television, and made numerous brief and not so brief appearances together in movies aside from the "Road" pictures.

In the 1949 Disney animated film ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]'', Crosby provided the narration and song vocals for ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' segment. In 1960, he starred in ''[[High Time (film)|High Time]]'', a collegiate comedy with [[Fabian Forte]] and [[Tuesday Weld]] that predicted the emerging gap between him and the new young generation of musicians and actors who had begun their careers after WWII. The following year, Crosby and Hope reunited for one more ''Road'' movie, ''[[The Road to Hong Kong]]'', which teamed them up with the much younger [[Joan Collins]] and [[Peter Sellers]]. Collins was used in place of their longtime partner Dorothy Lamour, whom Crosby felt was getting too old for the role, though Hope refused to do the movie without her, and she instead made a cameo appearance.&lt;ref name="kl." /&gt; Shortly before his death in 1977, he had planned  another ''Road'' film in which he, Hope, and Lamour search for the Fountain of Youth.

He won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for ''[[Going My Way]]'' in 1944 and was nominated for the 1945 sequel, ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]''. He received critical acclaim for his performance as an alcoholic entertainer in ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]'' and received his third Academy Award nomination.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Fisher| first1=James| title=Bing Crosby: Through the Years, Volumes One–Nine (1954–56)|journal=ARSC Journal|date=Spring 2012|volume= 43| issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
{{main|Bing Crosby TV appearances listing}}
[[File:Bing Crosby and family 1974 Christmas special.JPG|thumb|Crosby and his family in a Christmas special, 1974]]
''The Fireside Theater'' (1950) was his first television production. The series of 26-minute shows was filmed at [[Hal Roach#Hal Roach Studios|Hal Roach Studios]] rather than performed live on the air. The "telefilms" were syndicated to individual television stations. He was a frequent guest on the musical variety shows of the 1950s and 1960s. He was associated with ABC's ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]''. He was the show's first and most frequent guest host and appeared annually on its Christmas edition with his wife Kathryn and his younger children. In the early 1970s, he made two late appearances on the ''[[Flip Wilson Show]]'', singing duets with the comedian. His last TV appearance was a Christmas special taped in London in September 1977 and aired weeks after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pairpoint|first1=Lionel|title=The Chronological Bing Crosby on Television|url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/BingTV.htm|website=BING magazine|accessdate=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was on this special that he recorded a duet of "[[The Little Drummer Boy]]" and "Peace on Earth" with rock star [[David Bowie]]. Their duet was released in 1982 as a single 45-rpm record and reached No. 3 in the UK singles charts.&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"/&gt; It has since become a staple of holiday radio and the final popular hit of Crosby's career. At the end of the 20th century, ''TV Guide'' listed the Crosby-Bowie duet one of the 25 most memorable musical moments of 20th-century television.

Bing Crosby Productions, affiliated with [[Desilu Studios]] and later [[CBS Television Studios]], produced a number of television series, including Crosby's own unsuccessful ABC sitcom ''[[The Bing Crosby Show (1964 TV series)|The Bing Crosby Show]]'' in the 1964–1965 season (with co-stars [[Beverly Garland]] and [[Frank McHugh]]). The company produced two ABC medical dramas, ''[[Ben Casey]]'' (1961–1966) and ''[[Breaking Point (1963 TV series)|Breaking Point]]'' (1963–1964), the popular ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'' (1965–1971) military comedy on CBS, as well as the lesser-known show ''[[Slattery's People]]'' (1964–1965).

==Singing style and vocal characteristics==
[[File:Bing Crosby 1930s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Crosby in a 1930s publicity photo]]
Crosby was one of the first singers to exploit the intimacy of the microphone rather than use the deep, loud vaudeville style associated with Al Jolson.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/28/books/music-bing-crosby-the-unsung-king-of-song.html Bing Crosby: The Unsung King of Song], ''[[The New York Times]]'', Gary Giddins, January 28, 2001. Retrieved December 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He was, by his own definition, a "phraser", a singer who placed equal emphasis on both the lyrics and the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bing Crosby (1901?–1977)|date=1978|journal = Music Educators Journal |issue = 7 |pages = 56–57 |edition = 64}}&lt;/ref&gt; His love for jazz helped bring the genre to a wider audience.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In the framework of the novelty-singing style of [[the Rhythm Boys]], he bent notes and added off-tune phrasing, an approach that was  rooted in jazz.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} He had already been introduced to Louis Armstrong and [[Bessie Smith]] before his first appearance on record. Crosby and Armstrong remained friends for decades. They sang "Now You Has Jazz" in the film ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956).

During the early portion of his solo career (about 1931–1934), Crosby's emotional, often pleading style of [[crooning]] was popular. But Jack Kapp, manager of Brunswick and later Decca, talked him into dropping many of his jazzier mannerisms in favor of a clear vocal style. Crosby credited Kapp for choosing hit songs, working with many other musicians, and most importantly, diversifying his repertoire into several styles and genres. Kapp helped Crosby have number one hits in [[Christmas music]], [[Hawaiian music|Hawaiian]], and [[country music]], and top-thirty hits in [[Irish music]], [[French popular music|French music]], [[rhythm and blues]], and ballads.{{sfn|Gilliland|1994|loc=cassette 1, side B}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevenlewis.info/crosby/jackapp.htm |title=Jack Kapp – Bing Crosby Internet Museum |website=Stevenlewis.info|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crosby elaborated on an idea of Al Jolson's: phrasing, or the art of making a song's lyric ring true. "I used to tell Sinatra over and over," said Tommy Dorsey, "there's only one singer you ought to listen to and his name is Crosby. All that matters to him is the words, and that's the only thing that ought to for you, too."&lt;ref name="Friedwald2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedwald|first=Will|title=A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BW9dtlqrg_0C&amp;pg=PA116|accessdate=3 October 2018|date=2 November 2010|publisher=Knopf Doubleday |isbn=978-0-307-37989-4|pages=116–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[While] the octave B flat to B flat in Bing's voice at that time [1930s] is, to my ears, one of the loveliest I have heard in forty-five years of listening to baritones, both classical and popular, it dropped conspicuously in later years. From the mid-1950s, Bing was more comfortable in a bass range while maintaining a baritone quality, with the best octave being G to G, or even F to F. In a recording he made of '[[Dardanella]]' with Louis Armstrong in 1960, he attacks lightly and easily on a low E flat. This is lower than most opera basses care to venture, and they tend to sound as if they were in the cellar when they get there.&lt;ref name="Pleasants"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pleasants |first1=Henry |title=The Great American Popular Singers |date=1985 |publisher=Simon and Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Career statistics==
[[File:Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye in White Christmas trailer.jpg|right|thumb|''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'' (1954)]]
Crosby's was among the most popular and successful musical acts of the 20th century. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine used different methodologies during his career. But his chart success remains impressive: 396 chart singles, including 41 No.&amp;nbsp;1 hits.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/bing-crosby-records-in-music/3528/ |title=Bing Crosby &amp;#124; Bing by the Numbers.

He had 24 separate popular singles in 1939 alone. He may have been the best selling recording artist with up to 1 billion units sold.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bingcrosby.com/bing-bio/entertainer/bing-the-recording-star |title=Bing The Recording Star |publisher=Bing Crosby |date= |accessdate=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistician [[Joel Whitburn]] at ''Billboard'' determined that Crosby was America's most successful recording act of the 1930s and again in the 1940s.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

For fifteen years (1934, 1937, 1940, 1943–1954), Crosby was among the top top ten acts in box-office sales, and for five of those years (1944–1948) he topped the world.&lt;ref name="kl." /&gt; He sang four [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning songs&amp;nbsp;– "Sweet Leilani" (1937), "White Christmas" (1942), "[[Swinging on a Star]]" (1944), "In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening" (1951)&amp;nbsp;– and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in ''[[Going My Way]]'' (1944).

A survey in 2000 found that with 1,077,900,000 movie tickets sold, Crosby was the third most popular actor of all time, behind [[Clark Gable]] (1,168,300,000) and [[John Wayne]] (1,114,000,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macfarlane|first1=Malcolm|title=Bing Crosby – Day by Day|date=2001|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc|location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=0-8108-4145-2 |pages=670–671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''International Motion Picture Almanac'' lists him in a tie for second on the All Time Number One Stars List with [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Tom Hanks]], and [[Burt Reynolds]].&lt;ref name="Quigley"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Ten Money Making Stars of the past 79 years |url=http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html |publisher=Quigley Publishing |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114130743/http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html |archivedate= January 14, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His most popular film, ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'', grossed $30&amp;nbsp;million in 1954 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|30|1954}}}}&amp;nbsp;million in current value).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=Wayne|title=Waynes This and That|url=http://waynesthisandthat.com/crosbymovies.html |website=waynesthisandthat.com |accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received 23 gold and platinum records, according to the book ''Million Selling Records''. The Recording Industry Association of America did not institute its gold record certification program until 1958 when Crosby's record sales were low. Before 1958, gold records were awarded by record companies. Universal Music, owner of Crosby's Decca catalog, has never requested RIAA certification for any of his hit singles.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Crosby charted 23 ''Billboard'' hits from 47 recorded songs with the [[Andrews Sisters]], whose Decca record sales were second only to Crosby's throughout the 1940s. They were his most frequent collaborators on disc from 1939 to 1952, a partnership that produced four million-selling singles: "[[Pistol Packin' Mama]]", "[[Jingle Bells]]", "[[Don't Fence Me In (song)|Don't Fence Me In]]", and "South America, Take it Away". They made one film appearance together in ''[[Road to Rio]]'' singing "You Don't Have to Know the Language", and sang together on radio throughout the 1940s and 1950s. They appeared as guests on each other's shows and on [[Armed Forces Radio Service]] during and after World War II. The quartet's Top-10 ''Billboard'' hits from 1943 to 1945 include "The Vict'ry Polka", "There'll Be a Hot Time in the Town of Berlin (When the Yanks Go Marching In)", and "Is You Is or Is You Ain't (Ma' Baby?)" and helped morale of the American public.&lt;ref&gt;Sforza, John: "Swing It!

In 1962, Crosby was given the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. He has been inducted into the halls of fame for both radio and popular music. In 2007 he was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame and in 2008 the Western Music Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westernmusic.com/performers/hof-crosby.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120917192953/http://www.westernmusic.com/performers/hof-crosby.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 17, 2012 |title=Johnny Bond&amp;nbsp;– WMA Hall of Fame |publisher=Westernmusic.com |accessdate=February 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneurship==

===Role in early tape recording===
During the [[Golden Age of Radio]], performers had to create their shows live, sometimes even redoing the program a second time for the west coast time zone. Crosby's radio career took a significant turn in 1945, when he clashed with NBC over his insistence that he be allowed to pre-record his radio shows. (The live production of radio shows was also reinforced by the musicians' union and [[ASCAP]], which wanted to ensure continued work for their members.) In ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio'', John Dunning wrote about German engineers having developed a tape recorder with a near-professional broadcast quality standard:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Crosby saw] an enormous advantage in prerecording his radio shows. The scheduling could now be done at the star's convenience. He could do four shows a week, if he chose, and then take a month off. But the networks and sponsors were adamantly opposed. The public wouldn't stand for 'canned' radio, the networks argued. There was something magic for listeners in the fact that what they were hearing was being performed and heard everywhere, at that precise instant. Some of the best moments in comedy came when a line was blown and the star had to rely on wit to rescue a bad situation. Fred Allen, Jack Benny, Phil Harris, and also Crosby were masters at this, and the networks weren't about to give it up easily.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Crosby's insistence eventually factored into the further development of [[magnetic tape sound recording]] and the radio industry's widespread adoption of it.&lt;ref&gt;Hammar, Peter. Jack Mullin: The man and his Machines. Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, 37 (6): 490–496, 498, 500, 502, 504, 506, 508, 510, 512; June 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Afternoon with Jack Mullin. NTSC VHS tape, 1989 AES.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvhandbook.com/History/History_tape.htm |title=''History of Magnetic tape'', section: "Enter Bing Crosby" |accessdate=2017-03-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603153341/http://www.tvhandbook.com/History/History_tape.htm |archivedate=June 3, 2004 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He used his clout, both professional and financial, for innovations in audio. But NBC and CBS refused to broadcast prerecorded radio programs. Crosby left the network and remained off the air for seven months, creating a legal battle with his sponsor [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] that was settled out of court. He returned to broadcasting for the last 13 weeks of the 1945–1946 season.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The Mutual network, on the other hand, pre-recorded some of its programs as early as 1938 for ''[[The Shadow]]'' with [[Orson Welles]]. ABC was formed from the sale of the [[NBC Blue Network]] in 1943 after a federal [[anti-trust]] suit and was willing to join Mutual in breaking the tradition. ABC offered Crosby $30,000 per week to produce a recorded show every Wednesday that would be sponsored by [[Philco]]. He would get an additional $40,000 from 400 independent stations for the rights to broadcast the 30-minute show, which was sent to them every Monday on three 16-inch (40-cm) [[Acetate disc|lacquer discs]] that played ten minutes per side at 33{{sfrac|1|3}} rpm.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[File:Bing Crosby Perry Como Arthur Godfrey 1950.JPG|left|thumb|With [[Perry Como]] and [[Arthur Godfrey]] in 1950]]

Crosby wanted to change to recorded production for several reasons. The legend that has been most often told is that it would give him more time for golf. He did record his first Philco program in August 1947 so he could enter the [[Jasper National Park]] Invitational Golf Tournament in September when the radio season was to start. But golf was not the most important reason. He wanted better quality recording, the ability to eliminate mistakes, and to control the timing of his performances. Because Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show, he could purchase the best audio equipment and arrange the microphones his way; microphone placement had been debated in studios since the beginning of the electrical era. He would no longer have to wear the toupee that CBS and NBC required for his live audience shows—he preferred a hat. He could also record short promotions for his latest investment, the world's first frozen orange juice, sold under the brand name Minute Maid. This investment allowed him to make more money by finding a loophole where the IRS couldn't tax him at a 77% rate.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Murdo MacKenzie of Bing Crosby Enterprises had seen a demonstration of the German [[Magnetophon]] in June 1947—the same device that [[Jack Mullin]] had brought back from Radio Frankfurt with 50 reels of tape, at the end of the war. It was one of the magnetic tape recorders that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5mm ferric-oxide-coated tape could record 20 minutes per reel of high-quality sound. [[Alexander M. Poniatoff]] ordered Ampex, which he founded in 1944, to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophone.

Crosby hired Mullin to start recording his ''Philco Radio Time'' show on his German-made machine in August 1947 using the same 50 reels of I.G. Farben magnetic tape that Mullin had found at a radio station at [[Bad Nauheim]] near Frankfurt while working for the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The advantage was editing. As Crosby wrote in his autobiography:
&lt;blockquote&gt;By using tape, I could do a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit it down to the twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or situations that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mullin's 1976 memoir of these early days of experimental recording agrees with Crosby's account:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the evening, Crosby did the whole show before an audience. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it—thought it was very funny—but we would have to take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Crosby invested US$50,000 in Ampex with the intent to produce more machines.&lt;ref name="Sterling, C. H. 1990"/&gt; In 1948, the second season of Philco shows was recorded with the Ampex Model 200 and Scotch 111 tape from [[3M]]. Mullin explained how one new broadcasting technique was invented on the Crosby show with these machines:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, was on the show, and he threw in a few of his folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script. Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were different on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which just went on and on. We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Crosby started the tape recorder revolution in America. In his 1950 film ''[[Mr. Music]]'', he is seen singing into an Ampex tape recorder that reproduced his voice better than anything else. Also quick to adopt tape recording was his friend Bob Hope. He gave one of the first Ampex Model 300 recorders to his friend, guitarist [[Les Paul]], which led to Paul's invention of [[multitrack recording]]. His organization, the Crosby Research Foundation, held tape recording patents and developed equipment and recording techniques such as the [[laugh track]] that are still in use today.&lt;ref name="Sterling, C. H. 1990"&gt;Sterling, C. H., &amp; Kittross, J. M. (1990). Stay Tuned: A Concise History of American broadcasting (2nd ed.). Belmont, California: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Frank Sinatra, Crosby was of the principal backers for the [[United Western Recorders]] studio complex in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="CoganClark2003"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cogan |first1=Jim |last2=Clark |first2=William |title=Temples of Sound: Inside the Great Recording Studios |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hO-KQ4o_B2MC |accessdate=4 July 2018 |year=2003 |publisher=Chronicle Books |isbn=978-0-8118-3394-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Videotape development===
Mullin continued to work for Crosby to develop a [[videotape recorder]] (VTR). Television production was mostly [[live television]] in its early years, but Crosby wanted the same ability to record that he had achieved in radio. ''The Fireside Theater'' (1950) sponsored by [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], was his first television production. Mullin had not yet succeeded with videotape, so Crosby filmed the series of 26-minute shows at the Hal Roach Studios, and the "telefilms" were [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to individual television stations.

Crosby continued to finance the development of videotape. Bing Crosby Enterprises gave the world's first demonstration of videotape recording in Los Angeles on November 11, 1951. Developed by [[Jack Mullin|John T. Mullin]] and Wayne R. Johnson since 1950, the device aired what were described as "blurred and indistinct" images, using a modified [[Ampex]] 200 tape recorder and standard quarter-inch (6.3&amp;nbsp;mm) audio tape moving at 360&amp;nbsp;inches (9.1&amp;nbsp;m) per second.&lt;ref&gt;"Tape Recording Used by Filmless 'Camera{{'"}}, ''New York Times'', November 12, 1951, p. 21.

===TV station ownership===
A Crosby-led group purchased station [[KCOP-TV]], in Los Angeles, California, in 1954.&lt;ref name="ssc"&gt;{{cite web|title=KCOP Studio|url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/tvstudios/KCOP.shtml |work=Seeing Stars: the Television Studios |accessdate=March 23, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310010310/http://www.seeing-stars.com/TVstudios/KCOP.shtml |archivedate=March 10, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NAFI Corporation]] and Crosby purchased television station [[KPTV]] in Portland, Oregon, for $4&amp;nbsp;million on September 1, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dunevant |first=Ronald L. |title=KPTV Timeline |url=http://kptv.home.comcast.net/~kptv/timeline/timeline.htm|work=Yesterday's KPTV|publisher=Ronald L.

He partnered with [[Ed Craney]], who owned the CBS radio affiliate [[KXLY (AM)]] and built a television studio west of Crosby's alma mater, [[Gonzaga University]]. After it began broadcasting, the station was sold within a year to Northern Pacific Radio and Television Corporation.&lt;ref name="Rehberg"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rehberg |first1=Chuck |title=KXLY Celebrates Anniversary |url=https://spokanetvhistory.wordpress.com/1977/12/16/kxly-celebrates-anniversary/ |website=Spokane Television History |publisher=Spokane Daily Chronicle |accessdate=5 July 2018 |date=16 December 1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thoroughbred horse racing===
Crosby was a fan of [[Thoroughbred horse race|thoroughbred horse racing]] and bought his first racehorse in 1935. In 1937, he became a founding partner of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club and a member of its board of directors.&lt;ref name="bingcrosby.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Entrepreneur |url=http://bingcrosby.com/bing-bio/entrepreneur |website=bingcrosby.com |accessdate=19 November 2016 |date=15 August 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dmtc.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Del Mar Horse Racing History |url=https://www.dmtc.com/media/history |website=www.dmtc.com |accessdate=19 November 2016 |date=7 September 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating from the [[Del Mar Racetrack]] at Del Mar, California, the group included millionaire businessman [[Charles S. Howard]], who owned a successful racing stable that included [[Seabiscuit]].&lt;ref name="bingcrosby.com"/&gt; Charles' son, [[Lindsay C. Howard]] became one of Crosby's closest friends; Crosby named his son [[Lindsay Crosby|Lindsay]] after him, and would purchase his 40-room [[Hillsborough, California]] estate from Lindsay in 1965.

Crosby and Lindsay Howard formed [[Binglin Stable]] to race and breed thoroughbred horses at a ranch in [[Moorpark, California|Moorpark]] in Ventura County, California.&lt;ref name="bingcrosby.com"/&gt; They also established the Binglin stock farm in Argentina, where they raced horses at Hipódromo de Palermo in [[Palermo, Buenos Aires]]. A number of Argentine-bred horses were purchased and shipped to race in the United States. On August 12, 1938, the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club hosted a $25,000 winner-take-all [[match race]] won by Charles S. Howard's [[Seabiscuit]] over Binglin's horse Ligaroti.&lt;ref name="dmtc.com"/&gt; In 1943, Binglin's horse Don Bingo won the [[Suburban Handicap]] at [[Belmont Park]] in Elmont, New York.

The Binglin Stable partnership came to an end in 1953 as a result of a liquidation of assets by Crosby, who needed to raise enough funds to pay the hefty federal and state inheritance taxes on his deceased wife's estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = People, Aug. 3, 1953| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,822904,00.html|work=Time|accessdate =January 25, 2007| date=August 3, 1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bing Crosby Breeders' Cup Handicap]] at Del Mar Racetrack is named in his honor.

==Sports==
Crosby had an interest in sports. In the 1930s, his friend and former college classmate, [[Gonzaga Bulldogs football|Gonzaga]] head coach [[Mike Pecarovich]] appointed Crosby as an assistant football coach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gonzaga.edu/Academics/Libraries/Foley-Library/Departments/Special-Collections/Collections/Bing-Crosby-Collection/CrosbyandGonzaga2.asp Bing Crosby and Gonzaga University: 1925&amp;nbsp;– 1951] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219112102/http://www.gonzaga.edu/academics/libraries/foley-library/departments/special-collections/Collections/Bing-Crosby-Collection/CrosbyandGonzaga2.asp |date=February 19, 2016 }}, Gonzaga University, retrieved June 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1946 until his death, he owned a 25% share of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. Although he was passionate about the team, he was too nervous to watch the deciding Game 7 of the [[1960 World Series]], choosing to go to Paris with Kathryn and listen to its radio broadcast. Crosby had arranged for [[Ampex]], another of his financial investments, to record the [[NBC]] telecast on [[kinescope]]. The game was one of the most famous in baseball history, capped off by [[Bill Mazeroski]]'s [[walk-off home run]]. He apparently viewed the complete film just once, and then stored it in his wine cellar, where it remained undisturbed until it was discovered in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/throwback-thursday-bing-crosby-took-718437 Higgins, Bill.

Crosby was also an avid golfer, and in 1978, he and Bob Hope were voted the [[Bob Jones Award]], the highest honor given by the [[United States Golf Association]] in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship. He is a member of the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]]. In 1937, Crosby hosted the first 'Crosby Clambake' as it was popularly known, at Rancho Santa Fe Golf Club in [[Rancho Santa Fe, California]], the event's location prior to World War II. Sam Snead won the first tournament, in which the first place check was for $500. After the war, the event resumed play in 1947 on golf courses in Pebble Beach, where it has been played ever since. Now the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, it has been a leading event in the world of professional golf.

Crosby first took up golf at 12 as a caddy, dropped it, and started again in 1930 with some fellow cast members in Hollywood during the filming of ''[[The King of Jazz]]''. Crosby was accomplished at the sport, with a two handicap. He competed in both the [[The Amateur Championship|British]] and [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur]] championships, was a five-time club champion at Lakeside Golf Club in Hollywood, and once made a hole-in-one on the 16th at [[Cypress Point Club|Cypress Point]].

Crosby was a keen fisherman especially in his younger days but it was a pastime that he enjoyed throughout his life. In the summer of 1966 he spent a week as the guest of Lord Egremont, staying in [[Cockermouth]] and fishing on the [[River Derwent, Cumbria|River Derwent]]. His trip was filmed for ''[[The American Sportsman]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], although all did not go well at first as the [[salmon]] were not running. He did make up for it at the end of the week by catching a number of [[sea trout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://trouthotel.co.uk/journal/bing-crosby-came-stay/ | title=When Bing Crosby came to stay |publisher=Trout Hotel Web |date=April 18, 2017 |accessdate=May 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Crosby Brothers-older sons of Bing Crosby 1959.JPG|thumb|Crosby's sons from his first marriage. From left: The four Crosby brothers – [[Dennis Crosby|Dennis]], [[Gary Crosby (actor)|Gary]], [[Lindsay Crosby|Lindsay]] and [[Phillip Crosby|Phillip]] in 1959.]]
[[File:Bing, Harry and Nathan Crosby (1975) 02.jpg|thumb|right|Bing, [[Harry Crosby (businessman)|Harry]] and [[Nathaniel Crosby|Nathan Crosby]] (1975)]]

Crosby was married twice. His first wife was actress and nightclub singer [[Dixie Lee]] to whom he was married from 1930 until her death from ovarian cancer in 1952. They had four sons: [[Gary Crosby (actor)|Gary]], twins [[Dennis Crosby|Dennis]] and [[Phillip Crosby|Phillip]], and [[Lindsay Crosby|Lindsay]]. The ''[[Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman]]'' (1947) is based on Lee's life. The Crosby family lived at 10500 Camarillo Street in North Hollywood for over five years.&lt;ref&gt;1940 US Census via Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt; After his wife died, Crosby had relationships with model [[Pat Sheehan (model)|Pat Sheehan]] (who married his son Dennis in 1958) and actresses [[Inger Stevens]] and [[Grace Kelly]] before marrying actress [[Kathryn Crosby|Kathryn Grant]], who converted to Catholicism, in 1957. They had three children: [[Harry Crosby (businessman)|Harry Lillis III]] (who played Bill in ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]''), [[Mary Crosby|Mary]] (best known for portraying [[Kristin Shepard]], who shot [[J. R. Ewing]] on TV's ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''), and [[Nathaniel Crosby|Nathaniel]] (the 1981 U.S. Amateur champion in golf).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Crosby reportedly had an alcohol problem in his youth and may have been dismissed from Paul Whiteman's orchestra because of it, but he later got a handle on his drinking. According to Giddins, Crosby told his son Gary to stay away from alcohol, adding, "It killed your mother."&lt;ref name="Giddins2001" /&gt;{{rp|181}}

After Bing Crosby's death, his eldest son, Gary, wrote a highly critical memoir, ''Going My Own Way'', depicting his father as cruel, cold, remote, physically and psychologically abusive.&lt;ref name=lk&gt;{{cite web|last=Haller |first=Scot |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20084544,00.html |title=The Sad Ballad of Bing and His Boys&amp;nbsp;– Child Abuse, Kids &amp; Family Life, Bing Crosby |work=People |date=March 21, 1983 |accessdate=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We had to keep a close watch on our actions&amp;nbsp;... When one of us left a sneaker or pair of underpants lying around, he had to tie the offending object on a string and wear it around his neck until he went off to bed that night. Dad called it "the Crosby lavalier". At the time the humor of the name escaped me&amp;nbsp;...

"Satchel Ass" or "Bucket Butt" or "My Fat-assed Kid". That's how he introduced me to his cronies when he dragged me along to the studio or racetrack&amp;nbsp;... By the time I was ten or eleven he had stepped up his campaign by adding lickings to the regimen. Each Tuesday afternoon he weighed me in, and if the scale read more than it should have, he ordered me into his office and had me drop my trousers&amp;nbsp;... I dropped my pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped. It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early&amp;nbsp;...

When I saw ''Going My Way'' I was as moved as they were by the character he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming down hard on the kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All the way back to the house I thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one I knew at home.&lt;ref name="NoSpank"&gt;{{cite book| title=Going My Own Way| url=http://www.nospank.net/crosbyg.htm |author=Gary Crosby|date=March 1983 |publisher=Doubleday |isbn=978-0-385-17055-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Younger son Phillip vociferously disputed his brother Gary's claims about their father. Around the time Gary made his claim, Phillip stated to the press that "Gary is a whining, bitching crybaby, walking around with a two-by-four on his shoulder and just daring people to nudge it off."&lt;ref name="Haller"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Haller |first1=Scott |title=The Sad Ballad of Bing and His Boys |url=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-sad-ballad-of-bing-and-his-boys-vol-19-no-11/ |website=People.com |accessdate=5 July 2018 |date=21 March 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Phillip did not deny that Crosby believed in corporal punishment.&lt;ref name="Haller" /&gt; In an interview with [[People (American magazine)|''People'']], Phillip stated that "we never got an extra whack or a cuff we didn't deserve."&lt;ref name="Haller" /&gt; During an interview in 1999 by the ''[[Globe (tabloid)|Globe]]'', Phillip said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My dad was not the monster my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond memories of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote ''Going My Own Way'' out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name was the only way he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was the only way he could get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.&lt;ref name="Grudens, 2002, p. 59"&gt;Grudens, 2002, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Dennis and Lindsay Crosby confirmed that their father was physically abusive. Lindsay added, "I'm glad [Gary] did it. I hope it clears up a lot of the old lies and rumors."&lt;ref name="Haller" /&gt; Unlike Gary, however, Lindsay said that he preferred to remember "all the good things I did with my dad and forget the times that were rough."&lt;ref name="Haller" /&gt; Dennis asserted that the book was "Gary's business" and a result of his "anger"&lt;ref name="Haller" /&gt; but would not deny the book's claims. Bing's younger brother, singer and jazz bandleader [[Bob Crosby]], recalled at the time of Gary's revelations that Bing was a "disciplinarian," as their mother and father had been. He added, "We were brought up that way."&lt;ref name="Haller" /&gt; In an interview for the same article, Gary clarified that Bing was abusive as a means of administering punishment: "He was not out to be vicious, to beat children for his kicks."&lt;ref name="Haller" /&gt;

Crosby's will established a [[blind trust]] in which none of the sons received an inheritance until they reached the age of 65.&lt;ref name="Dunn"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-12-13/local/me-242_1_lindsay-crosby| first=Ashley| last=Dunn| date=December 13, 1989|work=Los Angeles Times | title=Lindsay Crosby Suicide Laid to End of Inheritance Income| accessdate=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindsay Crosby died in 1989 and Dennis Crosby died in 1991, both by suicide from self-inflicted gunshot wounds at ages 51 and 56, respectively. Gary Crosby died in 1995 at the age of 62 of lung cancer and 69-year-old Phillip Crosby died in 2004 of a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/20/arts/philip-crosby-69-son-of-bing-crosby.html |title=Philip Crosby, 69, Son of Bing Crosby |work=The New York Times |date=January 20, 2004 |accessdate=November 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widow [[Kathryn Crosby]] dabbled in local theater productions intermittently and appeared in television tributes to her late husband.

[[Nathaniel Crosby]], Crosby's youngest son from his second marriage, was a high-level golfer who won the [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur]] at age 19 in 1981, at the time the youngest winner of that event. [[Harry Crosby (businessman)|Harry Crosby]] is an investment banker who occasionally makes singing appearances.

[[Denise Crosby]], Dennis Crosby's daughter, is also an actress and is known for her role as [[Tasha Yar]] on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and for the recurring role of the Romulan [[Sela (Star Trek)|Sela]] (daughter of Tasha Yar) after her withdrawal from the series as a regular cast member. She also appeared in the film adaptation of Stephen King's novel ''[[Pet Sematary]]''.

In 2006, Crosby's niece through his sister Mary Rose, Carolyn Schneider, published the laudatory book ''Me and Uncle Bing''.

There have been disputes between Crosby's two families beginning in the late 1990s. When Dixie died in 1952, her will provided that her share of the community property be distributed in trust to her sons. After Crosby's death in 1977, he left the residue of his estate to a marital trust for the benefit of his widow, Kathryn, and HLC Properties, Ltd., was formed for the purpose of managing his interests, including his right of publicity. In 1996, Dixie's trust sued HLC and Kathryn for declaratory relief as to the trust's entitlement to interest, dividends, royalties, and other income derived from the community property of Crosby and Dixie. In 1999, the parties settled for approximately $1.5 million. Relying on a retroactive amendment to the [[California Civil Code]], Dixie's trust brought suit again, in 2010, alleging that Crosby's right of publicity was community property, and that Dixie's trust was entitled to a share of the revenue it produced. The trial court granted Dixie's trust's claim. The California Court of Appeal reversed, however, holding that the 1999 settlement barred the claim. In light of the court's ruling, it was unnecessary for the court to decide whether a right of publicity can be characterized as [[community property]] under California law.&lt;ref&gt;''Crosby v. HLC Properties, Ltd.'', Second District, Div. Three, Cal. App., Case No. B242089, filed January 29, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness and death==
[[File:Bing Crosby Last Perfromance Plaque.jpg|thumb|left|Commemorative plaque in the Brighton Centre foyer]]
Following his recovery from a life-threatening fungal infection of his right lung in January 1974, Crosby emerged from semi-retirement to start a new spate of albums and concerts. In March 1977, after videotaping a concert at the Ambassador Theater in Pasadena for CBS to commemorate his 50th anniversary in show business, and with Bob Hope looking on, Crosby fell off the stage into an [[orchestra pit]], rupturing a disc in his back requiring a month in the hospital. His first performance after the accident was his last American concert, on August 16, 1977 (the day singer [[Elvis Presley]] died); when the power went out during his performance, he continued singing without amplification.

In September, Crosby, his family and singer [[Rosemary Clooney]] began a concert tour of Britain that included two weeks at the [[London Palladium]]. While in the UK, Crosby recorded his final album, ''[[Seasons (Bing Crosby album)|Seasons]]'', and his final TV Christmas special with guest [[David Bowie]] on September 11 (which aired a little over a month after Crosby's death). His last concert was in the [[Brighton Centre]] on October 10, four days before his death, with British entertainer Dame [[Gracie Fields]] in attendance. The following day he made his final appearance in a recording studio and sang eight songs at the BBC Maida Vale studios for a radio program, which also included an interview with Alan Dell.&lt;ref name="barnes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes |first=Ken |title=The Crosby Years |publisher=Saint Martins Press |location=New York |year=1980 |pages=57–60 |isbn=978-0-312-17663-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accompanied by the Gordon Rose Orchestra, Crosby's last recorded performance was of the song "[[Once in a While (1937 song)|Once in a While]]". Later that afternoon, he met with Chris Harding to take photographs for the ''Seasons'' album jacket.&lt;ref name="barnes"/&gt;

[[File:Bing Crosby's grave.JPG|thumb|Crosby's grave at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California (incorrect birth year)]]

==Compositions==
Crosby wrote or co-wrote lyrics to 22 songs. His composition "[[At Your Command]]" was no. 1 for three weeks on the U.S. pop singles chart beginning on August 8, 1931.

Vishal was born in India and the Mehrotra family came to the UK in 1978.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Tragic end to missing boy hunt – Skeleton mystery|last=|first=|date=4 March 1982|work=The Herald|access-date=|publisher=|others=|month=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishal's father, Vishambar Mehrotra, was a solicitor at the time of the disappearance&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and is now a retired magistrate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/19/paedophile-ring-allegations-elm-house|title=Paedophile ring allegations: police are failing us, murdered boy’s father says|last=Laville|first=Sandra|last2=Halliday|first2=Josh|date=19 November 2014|work=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/murdered-boys-father-says-police-ignored-informant-8b9d32s6wj6|title=Murdered boy’s father says police ignored informant|last=O’Neill|first=Sean|date=19 November 2014|work=The Times|access-date=19 August 2018|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishal's mother, Aruba Mehrita, was estranged from her husband and lived in India at the time of the disappearance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The family lived on Holmbush Road, [[Putney]], [[South London]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Vishal was described as bright and independent. He travelled to his school in Queens Gate every day on his own.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Day of the disappearance==
29 July 1981 was the day of the [[Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer|wedding of Charles and Diana]]. Vishal had been watching the royal wedding with his father, sister and nanny.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The family were walking home through the crowded streets and Vishal was walking ahead of his family.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At [[East Putney tube station|East Putney]] tube station Vishal parted company with his family and went home alone while his sister and nanny went shopping.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The family last saw him cross the road near Carlton Drive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Initial investigation==
The initial police investigation involved searching the vicinity of the disappearance from the air with a thermal camera as well as ground searches of common land and the river Thames.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Initially, it was thought that Vishal could have tried to travel to India and this line of inquiry was investigated by international police.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Between the disappearance and the discovery of the body the police investigated hundreds of sightings and interviewed over 14,000 people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Discovery of the body==
On 25 February 1982 two men, who were shooting pigeons, discovered a skull, seven rib bones and a section of vertebrae at Alder Copse, Durleigh Marsh Farm, [[Rogate]] near [[Chichester]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The bones appeared to have been disturbed by foxes and were found buried in a bog at a depth of around two feet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Following the discovery, a large scale excavation and search involving about 30 police officers took place.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This uncovered more bones, however, no clothing was found.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The bones were taken to London for forensic investigation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Initially, police believed that the body had been buried around 29 July 1981.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Subsequent investigations==
Police initially believed that Vishal may have been abducted by someone with local knowledge of the Durleigh Marsh Farm area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In March 2015, the BBC reported that the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] had referred itself to the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] following allegations of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-31717179|title=Boy's 1981 death to be probed by IPCC|date=3 March 2015|work=BBC News|access-date=18 August 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' newspaper reported that a 2005 Sussex Police review, by ex-detective Alwyn Evans, had been released to the paper following a [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|FOI]] request.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The review mentioned [[Sidney Cooke|Sydney Cooke]] a number of times and showed that Cooke had begun to be linked with abductions in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cooke was a fairground worker and the report revealed that there were two fairs in the area when Vishal vanished.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The findings were apparently not acted upon.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Roger Stoodley, who retired as the detective leading the Cooke gang investigation in 1992, stated that the disappearances of Vishal (and another boy [[Disappearance of Martin Allen|Martin Allen]]) were in keeping with the gangs [[modus operandi]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/paedophile-gang-may-have-killed-17-more-children-qm7mxjs9tvf|title=Paedophile gang ‘may have killed 17 more children’|last=O’Neill|first=David Brown, Georgie Keate and Sean|date=20 November 2014|work=The Times|access-date=21 August 2018|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gang were known to have abducted boys who they found walking on their own.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Elm Guest House ==
A few months after his son's disappearance Vishambar Mehrotra said that he had been contacted by an unidentified man thought to be in his twenties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This man suggested that Vishal had been abducted, and that this event may be connected to a group of influential paedophiles associated with the [[Elm Guest House claims and controversy|Elm Guest House]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The man stated that he had informed the police but they had not followed up his report.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Vishambar gave a recording of the telephone conversation to detectives, however, they dismissed it as a crank call and it was not followed up.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The location of Vishal's disappearance was less than a mile from the Elm Guest House.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''''Dinakaran'' attack case''' was a [[Firebombing|firebomb]] attack by [[M. K. Alagiri]]'s supporters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://rsf.org/en/news/three-newspaper-employees-killed-arson-attack-tamil-nadu-state | title=Three newspaper employees killed in arson attack in Tamil Nadu state | publisher=[[Reporters Without Borders]] | date=10 May 2007 | accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/states/story/20070521-karunanidhis-family-drama-for-power-748583-2007-05-21 | title=M.Karunanidhi's 50 years were on the cost of Tamil daily Dinakaran | publisher=[[India Today]] | work=S. S. Jeevan | date=21 May 2007 | accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on 9 May 2007 on the [[Madurai]] office of ''[[Dinakaran]]'', a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] newspaper, which resulted in the deaths of three people.&lt;ref name="toi-incident"&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Press Trust of India|PTI]]|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-05-09/india/27884568_1_m-k-azhagiri-security-personnel-dmk|title=3 people killed in Dinakaran attack |work=[[The Times of India]]|date=9 May 2007|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was a response to a survey published by ''Dinakaran'' on who people preferred as the future heir of [[M. Karunanidhi]], chief of the political party [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK). During mass protests throughout the region, the offices of the newspaper were firebombed and two press employees and a private security guard died. 17 people were charged by the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]], but were all acquitted by the district court. [[Dayanidhi Maran]] resigned from the [[Cabinet of India|Union Cabinet]], where he had been the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, as a result of the controversy surrounding the attack, which created a rift between him and DMK.

==Background==

[[M. K. Stalin]] and [[M. K. Azhagiri]], sons of DMK chief [[M. Karunanidhi]] were in a [[Karunanidhi_family#Azhagiri_Vs_Stalin|succession battle]] to be the political heir of Karunanidhi.
&lt;!-- TODO: Develop the section with full text on succession battle instead of linking the section. -------------------------M. K. Stalin's loyalist [[Tha.

&lt;/ref&gt;--------------------------------------- --&gt;
In May 2007, the newspaper ''Dinakaran'' caused controversy when it published the results of a series of opinion polls conducted by [[A.C. Nielsen Co.]] which appeared to show that Stalin had more public approval than his elder brother Azhagiri – 70% of those polled preferred Stalin, while only 2% preferred Azhagiri (another 2% supported [[M. K. Kanimozhi]], daughter of Karunanidhi).&lt;ref name="toi-incident"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hindu-incident"&gt;{{cite news|author=S.

==Incident==
On 9 May 2007, agitated by the results of the survey, DMK cadres in the southern district of Tamil Nadu, particularly the supporters of Azhagiri, engaged in protests at [[Kamuthi]], [[Dindigul]], [[Tirunelveli]], [[Virudhunagar]] and [[Tuticorin]] and various places in the [[Theni district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=PTI|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-05-09/india/27887875_1_newspaper-office-dmk-tamil-nadu|title=DMK activists set fire to Tamil daily office, 1 killed|work=The Times of India|date=9 May 2007|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Madurai, they protested by burning copies of the newspapers and raising slogans against the survey and the Maran brothers. They also held a [[road block protest]], threw stones, and set seven buses on fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=மதுரை தினகரன்-சன் டிவி அலுவலகம் மீது அழகிரி ஆதரவாளர்கள் பயங்கர தாக்குதல்:3 பேர் பலி- 7 பஸ்களுக்கு தீ வைப்பு|url=http://tamil.oneindia.in/news/2007/05/09/alagiri.html|publisher=[[OneIndia]] Tamil|language=Tamil|date=9 May 2007|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating trouble, a team of anti-riot police under the Deputy Superintendent of Madurai were deployed outside the offices of the media group. Despite the police presence, a group of men hurled stones at the building housing the offices of ''Dinakaran'', [[Sun TV (India)|Sun TV]] and [[Tamil Murasu (India)|Tamil Murasu]], all belonging to Sun Group. They also threw [[petrol bomb]]s and set the building on fire, resulting in the death by [[asphyxiation]] of two employees and a private security guard.&lt;ref name="hindu-incident"/&gt;

The staff of the newspaper blocked the [[National Highway 45B (India)|Chennai Madurai highway]], demanding the arrest of Azhagiri, charging him with responsibility for the incident.&lt;ref name="hindu-incident"/&gt; The staff also accused the police of inaction.&lt;ref name="HinduPoliceInaction"&gt;{{cite news|author=Special Correspondent|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/police-blamed-for-inaction/article1840354.ece|title=Police blamed for inaction|work=The Hindu|date=10 May 2007|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madurai Superintendent T. S. Anbu said there was no deliberate dereliction of duty by the police; however, the Director General of Police, D. Mukharjee, later admitted dereliction of duty by policemen and ordered a probe be conducted by a senior police official.&lt;ref name="CBI-transfer"&gt;{{cite news|author=S.

==Aftermath==

Kalanidhi Maran, managing director of Sun Networks, called this incident an "attack on [[Freedom of press|freedom of the press]]", and vowed to fight for justice.&lt;ref name="KMaranReply"&gt;{{cite news|agency=PTI|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-05-09/india/27877239_1_dinakaran-office-kalanidhi-maran-sun-network|title=Kalanidhi Maran to fight state, Centre for justice|work=The Times of India|date=9 May 2007|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; M. Karunanidhi condemned the attack, calling it "an attack on democracy and press freedom", and promised legal action. On the whole issue of political heirs, he said that "there is no place for dynastic succession in the DMK".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/karunanidhi-no-place-for-dynastic-succession/article1840355.ece|title=Karunanidhi: no place for dynastic succession|work=The Hindu|date=10 May 2007|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later told the [[Tamil Nadu Assembly]] that he was puzzled by the timing of the survey, and had told the ''Dinakaran'' management that such polls may create unnecessary problems, but that the newspaper had ignored his advice.&lt;ref name="frontline"/&gt; Several journalists' associations condemned the attack and submitted a memorandum calling for immediate police action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/journalists-fora-to-submit-memorandum/article1841367.ece|title=Journalists' fora to submit memorandum|work=The Hindu|date=12 May 2007|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; urging the government to bring charges against not only the assailants but also "the persons behind the conspiracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/journalists-mark-protest-against-arson-attack-on-madurai-newspaper-office/article1840779.ece|title=Journalists mark protest against arson attack on Madurai newspaper office|work=The Hindu|date=11 May 2007|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dayanidhi Maran]], who is usually present along with Karunanidhi on most party functions, stayed away from the celebration of Karunanidhi's 50th year as legislator, which was attended by [[Manmohan Singh]] and [[Sonia Gandhi]]. DMK's administrative committee suggested that Dayanidhi Maran be removed from the Union Cabinet for violating party discipline. Maran, however, resigned voluntarily, insisting that he had never taken part in anti-party activities and that someone was misleading the party chief.&lt;ref name="frontline"&gt;{{cite web |last=Subramanian |first=T.S. |title=Mayhem in Madurai |url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2410/stories/20070601004402200.htm |publisher=The Hindu Frontline |accessdate=22 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IJ32ALNj?url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2410/stories/20070601004402200.htm |archivedate=22 July 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kalaignar TV]], a new channel owned by the Karunanidhi family, was launched as a potential rival to Sun TV when the tensions between Karunanidhi and the Maran brothers were at their highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=D Govardan|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2007-06-14/news/28419240_1_raj-tv-raj-television-network-gemini-tv|title=Karunanidhi family owns New TV channel Kalaignar|work=The Economic Times|date=14 June 2007|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also announced the formation of [[Tamil Nadu Arasu Cable TV Corporation Limited]], a new [[multiple-system operator]] which intended to end the monopoly of [[Sun Cable Vision]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In December 2008, the Marans made peace with the Karunanidhi family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/marans-patch-up-with-karunanidhi/article1387063.ece|title=Marans patch up with Karunanidhi|work=The Hindu|date=2 December 2008|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court proceedings===

The management of ''Dinakaran'' accused the police of ignoring their formal complaint, which specifically sought action against Azhagiri, and instead choose to act on a ''[[suo motu]]'' complaint which did not include his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=S. Vijay Kumar|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/police-ignored-our-complaint-says-dinakaran/article1840702.ece|title=Police ignored our complaint, says Dinakaran|work=The Hindu|date=11 May 2007|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 2009, police arrested their prime suspect, P. Pandi (aka "Attack" Pandi), who later confessed to spearheading the attack.&lt;ref name="AttackPandiNabbed"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/prime-suspect-in-dinakaran-office-attack-case-held/article1842929.ece|title=Prime suspect in ''Dinakaran'' office attack case held|work=The Hindu|date=16 May 2007|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was transferred to the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]],&lt;ref name="CBI-transfer"/&gt; which named 17 accused in a 32-page charge sheet, including a [[Deputy Superintendent]] charged with dereliction of duty.&lt;ref name="chargesheet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/1113953/report-16-chargesheeted-in-dinakaran-attack-case|title=16 chargesheeted in Dinakaran attack case|date=6 August 2007|accessdate=23 July 2013|publisher = DNA India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, all 17 were acquitted by the district sessions court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Special Correspondent|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/all-acquitted-in-dinakaran-case/article91128.ece|title=All acquitted in Dinakaran case|work=The Hindu|date=10 December 2009|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which claimed that the case had not been proven beyond all reasonable doubt. In March 2011, the [[Madras High Court]] allowed an appeal challenging this decision, despite a delay in filing the same. The CBI contended that the trial court "ought to have considered the evidentiary value of Prosecution Witness 1", even though he had "turned hostile" during the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mohamed Imranullah S.|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/court-condones-delay-in-filing-appeal-in-dinakaran-attack-case/article1537881.ece|title=Court condones delay in filing appeal in 'Dinakaran' attack case|location=MADURAI|work=The Hindu|date=14 March 2011|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eustathios Argyros''' ({{lang-el|Εὐστάθιος Ἀργυρός}}; died ca. 910) was a [[Byzantine]] aristocrat and one of the most prominent generals under Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise]] (r. 886–912). The first member of the [[Argyros (Byzantine family)|Argyros family]] to rise to high posts, he fought with distinction against the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arabs]] in the east, before being disgraced ca. 907, possibly in connection with the flight of [[Andronikos Doukas (general under Leo VI)|Andronikos Doukas]] to the Arabs. Rehabilitated soon after, he was appointed as ''[[strategos]]'' of [[Charsianon]], from which post he oversaw the settlement of [[Armenians|Armenian]] lords as march-wardens along the Empire's eastern frontier. Promoted to commander of the [[Vigla (tagma)|imperial bodyguard]] in late 908, he again fell into disgrace shortly after and died of poison (apparently a suicide) on his way to his estates.

== Life ==
Eustathios Argyros was the son of the ''[[tourmarches]]'' [[Leo Argyros (9th century)|Leo Argyros]], the founder of the noble [[Argyros (Byzantine family)|Argyros family]].{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|pp=58, 59}}{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Eustathios Argyros (#21828)}}

Nothing is known of his life or prior to the turn of the 10th century, although he may have been in imperial service as early as 866, when a man of the same name is recorded as ''[[protostrator]]'' of the ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' [[Bardas]] in connection with the latter's murder on 21 April.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Eustathios Argyros (#21828)}}{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|p=59}}{{sfn|Tougher|1997|p=210}} The Byzantine historians praise Eustathios Argyros as an intelligent, valiant, prudent and just man, and account him, along with [[Andronikos Doukas (general under Leo VI)|Andronikos Doukas]], as the best of Leo VI's generals.{{sfn|Guilland|1967|pp=570–571}}{{sfn|Tougher|1997|pp=207–208}} The historians Jean-Claude Cheynet and Jean-François Vannier, experts on Byzantine prosopography, consider him "the true founder of the family's glory".{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|p=59}}

Although he is sometimes identified with an admiral active in ca. 902–904 (see [[#Identity|below]]), his life is only securely attested after 904.{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|p=59}}{{sfn|Tougher|1997|p=210}} At this time, evidently after a succession of—unknown—military commands, Eustathios had reached, according to ''[[Theophanes Continuatus]]'', the rank of ''[[patrikios]]'' and ''[[hypostrategos]]'' of the [[Anatolic Theme]]. The significance of the term "''hypostrategos''" has been debated; normally it would designate the second-in-command to the ''[[strategos]]'' or military governor of a [[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]], but Vannier suggested that on account of his high title of ''patrikios'', Argyros was actually the ''strategos''.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Eustathios Argyros (#21828)}}{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|p=59}}{{sfn|Tougher|1997|p=210}} ''Theophanes Continuatus'' further extols Argyros and mentions that he scored several successes against the [[Arabs]] in the east, most likely a reference to the great Byzantine victory over the Arabs of [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] and [[Mopsuestia]] at [[Germanikeia]] in December 904, under the overall command of Andronikos Doukas.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Eustathios Argyros (#21828)}}{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|p=59}} He then fell into disgrace and was exiled. Although no details or reasons are offered for his exile, this has been interpreted by modern scholars as being connected to the failed rebellion and flight of Andronikos Doukas to the Arabs in 906–907. Eustathios was rehabilitated soon after; if indeed his disgrace was related to the flight of Andronikos Doukas, this happened likely in 907/8, when Andronikos Doukas' son [[Constantine Doukas (usurper)|Constantine]] escaped from his Arab exile and returned to Constantinople, where he was pardoned by Emperor Leo.{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|p=59}}{{sfn|Guilland|1967|pp=570–571}}{{sfn|Tougher|1997|pp=209–210, 211}} 

Eustathios was then appointed as ''strategos'' of the border theme of [[Charsianon]], a position notably inferior in rank to that of the Anatolics that he had held previously.{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|p=59}} The Argyros family, however, had strong connections with Charsianon, from which it hailed.{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|p=58}} There he received the return to imperial service of a number of [[Medieval Armenia|Armenian]] lords, [[Melias]], the three brothers Baasakios, Krigorikios and Pazounes, and Ismael, who were established as march-wardens along the Empire's eastern border.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Eustathios Argyros (#21828)}}{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|p=59}}{{sfn|Tougher|1997|p=211}} Of them, Melias in particular would go on to become the founder of the theme of [[Lykandos]] and one of the main Byzantine leaders in the wars against the Arabs over the next 30 years.{{sfn|Guilland|1957|pp=206–207}}

In late 908 Eustathios Argyros was promoted to the rank of ''[[magistros]]''—the highest court dignity open to someone not a member of the imperial family—and the post of [[Drungary of the Watch]], i.e. commander of the [[Vigla (tagma)|imperial bodyguard]], and replaced as ''strategos'' of Charsianon by Constantine Doukas.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Eustathios Argyros (#21828)}}{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|pp=59–60}} About a year later, he fell again under Leo's suspicion, and was ordered to return to his family's estates at Charsianon. Again the reason is unknown; perhaps, according to Cheynet and Vannier, it was a result of the unreliability of the Armenian lords he had welcomed into the Empire, who frequently went over to the Arabs.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Eustathios Argyros (#21828)}}{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|p=60}} On the way, he died after taking poison by one of his servants, and was buried on Spynin, the summit of Mount Aran.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Eustathios Argyros (#21828)}}{{sfn|Tougher|1997|p=211}}{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|p=60}} While historian [[Romilly James Heald Jenkins]] has suggested that Argyros' poisoning was done through an agent of the powerful and scheming court eunuch [[Samonas]], it more likely was suicide.{{sfn|Tougher|1997|pp=213, 218}} His two sons, [[Pothos Argyros (Domestic of the Schools)|Pothos]] and [[Leo Argyros (10th century)|Leo]], who served in the palace as [[manglabites]] (personal bodyguards of the emperor), arranged to have their father's body transferred for burial to the monastery of Saint Elizabeth in the Charsianon district, founded by Eustathios' father.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Eustathios Argyros (#21828)}}{{sfn|Tougher|1997|p=211}}{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|p=60}}

== Family ==
Eustathios' sons Pothos and Leo would go on to hold senior military commands, including the post of [[Domestic of the Schools]] (commander-in-chief).{{sfn|Tougher|1997|p=211}}{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|pp=60–62}} Another son, Romanos, is known only from his participation in the [[Battle of Achelous (917)|Battle of Achelous]] in 917.{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|2003|p=62}} Leo Argyros married a daughter of Emperor [[Romanos I Lekapenos]] (r. 920–944), and was probably the grandfather or great-grandfather of Emperor [[Romanos III Argyros]] (r. 1028–1034).{{sfn|Guilland|1957|p=189}}

== Identity ==
Some modern scholars like R. J. H. Jenkins (''The 'Flight' of Samonas''), [[R. H. Dolley]] (''The Lord High Admiral Eustathios Argyros and the betrayal of Taormina to the African Arabs in 902'') and [[Ekkehard Eickhoff]] (''Seekrieg und Seepolitik zwischen Islam und Abendland'') consider Eustathios Argyros to have been identical with the contemporary admiral [[Eustathios Argyros (admiral under Leo VI)|Eustathios]], active in the years before 904, mainly due to the reference by the 11th-century historian [[John Skylitzes]] that Argyros pursued a career in the army as well as in the fleet. This identification is rejected by other scholars like [[J.-F. Vannier]] (''Familles byzantines: les Argyroi (IXe–XIIe siècles)'') and [[Rodolphe Guilland|R. Guilland]] (''Recherches sur les institutions byzantines''). Furthermore, the admiral is given the surname "Argyros" in some modern works that distinguish him from the general, while others reject the surname entirely. According to the ''[[Prosopographie der mittelbyzantinischen Zeit]]'', "a definitive decision can no longer be made", and the main argument for the two being different persons is the incompatibility of their careers: the admiral Eustathios likewise experienced a tumultuous career with accusations of treason, rehabilitation, and renewed disgrace, and it is unlikely that such a man would again be entrusted with senior posts.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Eustathios (#21836); Eustathios Argyros (#21828)}}

{{Individualism sidebar}}
An '''individual''' is that which exists as a distinct [[entity]]. '''Individuality''' (or [[wikt:selfhood|selfhood]]) is the state or quality of being an individual; particularly of being a person separate from other people and possessing his or her own [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|needs]] or [[Personal goal setting|goals]], [[right]]s and [[moral responsibility|responsibilities]]. The exact definition of an individual is important in the fields of [[biology]], [[law]], and [[philosophy]].

From the 15th century and earlier (and also today within the fields of [[statistics]] and [[metaphysics]]) ''individual'' meant "[[divisible|indivisible]]", typically describing any numerically singular thing, but sometimes meaning "a person". From the 17th century on, ''individual'' indicates separateness, as in [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Abbs 1986, cited in Klein 2005, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Although individuality and individualism are commonly considered to mature with age/time and experience/wealth, a [[sanity|sane]] adult [[human|human being]] is usually considered by the [[State (polity)|state]] as an "individual person" in law, even if the person denies individual [[culpability]] ("I followed instructions"). An individual person is [[accountability|accountable]] for their actions/decisions/instructions, subject to [[prosecution]] in both national and international law, from the time that they have reached [[age of majority]], often though not always more or less coinciding with the granting of [[voting right]]s, [[tax]] and [[military duty|military duties]]/ individual [[Right to keep and bear arms|right to bear arms]] (protected only under certain constitutions). In line with [[hierarchy]], ultimate individual human reward for [[Social status|success]] and responsibility for [[failure]] is nonetheless found at the top of [[society|human society]].

==Law==
in [[International law]]:
:All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Article 1 of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

in [[Law of the United States|American law]]:
:A natural person is a human being. A legal person is an entity such as a company, which is regarded in law as having its own 'legal personality'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jon Rush|author2=Michael Ottley|title=Business Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2gFZhuB5boC&amp;pg=PA4|year=2006|publisher=Cengage Learning |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law'' states: A "natural person" is "A human being as distinguished from person (as a corporation) created by operation of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merriam-Webster, Inc|title=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYs74quLWLIC&amp;pg=PA323|year=1996|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1910 legal dictionary states: "Individual: As a noun, this term denotes a single person as distinguished from a group or class, and also, very commonly, a private or natural person as distinguished from a partnership, corporation, or association."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Campbell Black|title=A Law Dictionary Containing Definitions of the Terms and Phrases of American and English Jurisprudence, Ancient and Modern. 2nd edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNQgVoT2_aQC&amp;pg=PA618|year=1910|page=618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
===Buddhism===
In [[Buddhism]], the concept of the individual lies in [[anatman]], or "no-self." According to anatman, the individual is really a series of interconnected processes that, working together, give the appearance of being a single, separated whole. In this way, anatman, together with [[anicca]], resembles a kind of [[bundle theory]]. Instead of an atomic, indivisible self distinct from reality, the individual in Buddhism is understood as an interrelated part of an ever-changing, impermanent universe (see [[Interdependence]], [[Nondualism]], [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|Reciprocity]]).

===Empiricism===
Early [[Empiricism|empiricists]] such as [[Ibn Tufail]]&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;G. A. Russell (1994), ''The 'Arabick' Interest of the Natural Philosophers in Seventeenth-Century England'', pp. 224–62, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|90-04-09459-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  in early 12th century Islamic Spain, and [[John Locke]] in late 17th century England, [[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan#Empiricism, tabula rasa, nature versus nurture|introduced the idea]] of the individual as a [[tabula rasa]] ("blank slate"), shaped from birth by experience and education. This ties into the idea of the liberty and rights of the individual, society as a [[social contract]] between [[Rationality|rational]] individuals, and the beginnings of [[individualism]] as a doctrine.

===Hegel&lt;!--linked from 'Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel'--&gt;===
[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] regarded history as the gradual evolution of Mind as it tests its own concepts against the external world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Each time the mind applies its concepts to the world, the concept is revealed to be only partly true, within a certain context; thus the mind continually revises these incomplete concepts so as to reflect a fuller reality (commonly known as the process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis). The individual comes to rise above his or her own particular viewpoint,{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} and grasps that he or she is a part of a greater whole{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} insofar as he or she is bound to family, a social context, and/or a political order.

===Existentialism===
With the rise of [[existentialism]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]] rejected Hegel's notion of the individual as subordinated to the forces of history. Instead, he elevated the individual's subjectivity and capacity to choose his or her own fate. Later Existentialists built upon this notion.  [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], for example, examines the individual's need to define his/her own self and circumstances in his concept of [[the will to power]] and the heroic ideal of the [[Übermensch]]. The individual is also central to [[Sartre]]'s philosophy, which emphasizes individual authenticity, responsibility, and [[free will]]. In both Sartre and Nietzsche (and in [[Nikolai Berdyaev]]), the individual is called upon to create his or her own values, rather than rely on external, socially imposed codes of morality.

===Objectivism===
[[Ayn Rand]]'s [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] regards every human as an independent, sovereign entity who possesses an inalienable right to his or her own life, a right derived from his or her nature as a rational being. Individualism and Objectivism hold that a civilized society, or any form of association, cooperation or peaceful coexistence among humans, can be achieved only on the basis of the recognition of [[individual rights]]&amp;nbsp;— and that a group, as such, has no rights other than the individual rights of its members. The principle of individual rights is the only moral base of all groups or associations. Since only an individual man or woman can possess rights, the expression "individual rights" is a redundancy (which one has to use for purposes of clarification in today's intellectual chaos), but the expression "[[collective rights]]" is a contradiction in terms. Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a [[Tyranny of the majority|majority]] has no right to vote away the rights of a [[minority group|minority]]; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual).&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand, [http://www.aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individualism.html ''"Individualism"'']. Ayn Rand Lexicon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand (1961), [http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individualrights.html ''"Individual Rights"'']. Ayn Rand Lexicon.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology&lt;!--Linked from 'Extraterrestrial life'--&gt;==
In [[biology]], the question of the individual is related to the definition of an [[organism]], which is an important question in biology and [[philosophy of biology]], despite there having been little work devoted explicitly to this question.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Wilson | first = R | title = The biological notion of individual | journal = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | year = 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/biology-individual/}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual organism is not the only kind of individual that is considered as a "unit of [[Selection (biology)|selection]]".&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; [[Gene]]s, [[genome]]s, or groups may function as individual units.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

[[Asexual reproduction]] occurs in some colonial organisms so that the individuals are genetically identical. Such a colony is called a [[genet (biology)|genet]], and an individual in such a population is referred to as a ramet. The colony, rather than the individual, functions as a unit of selection. In other colonial organisms the individuals may be closely related to one another but differ as a result of [[sexual reproduction]].

[[Image:Langtons Loop.png|frame|right|Langton's Loop, in the starting configuration.]]

'''Langton's loops''' are a particular "species" of [[artificial life]] in a [[cellular automaton]] created in 1984 by [[Christopher Langton]]. They consist of a loop of cells containing genetic information, which flows continuously around the loop and out along an "arm" (or [[pseudopod]]), which will become the daughter loop. The "genes" instruct it to make three left turns, completing the loop, which then disconnects from its parent.

== History ==

In 1952 [[John von Neumann]] created the first cellular automaton (CA) with the goal of creating a self-replicating machine.&lt;ref name=TSRA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/index.html |title=''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata.'' |author=von Neumann, John |author2=Burks, Arthur W. |date=1966 |publisher=www.walenz.org |format=Scanned book online |accessdate=2008-02-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105213853/http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/index.html |archivedate=2008-01-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This automaton was necessarily very complex due to its computation- and construction-universality. In 1968 [[Edgar F. Codd]] reduced the number of states from 29 in [[von Neumann cellular automaton|von Neumann's CA]] to 8 in [[Codd's cellular automaton|his]].&lt;ref name=Codd68&gt;{{cite book|author = Codd, Edgar F.|title=Cellular Automata|publisher=Academic Press, New York|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Christopher Langton did away with the universality condition, he was able to significantly reduce the automaton's complexity. Its self-replicating loops are based on one of the simplest elements in Codd's automaton, the periodic emitter.

== Specification ==

Langton's Loops run in a CA that has 8 states, and uses the [[von Neumann neighborhood]] with rotational symmetry. The [[State transition table|transition table]] can be found here: [http://code.google.com/p/ruletablerepository/wiki/TheRules#Self-replicating_loops].

As with [[Codd's cellular automaton|Codd's CA]], Langton's Loops consist of sheathed wires. The signals travel passively along the wires until they reach the open ends, when the command they carry is executed.

[[Image:Langtons Loop Colony.png|thumb|right|A colony of loops. The ones in the centre are "dead".]]

=== Colonies ===

Because of a particular property of the loops' "pseudopodia", they are unable to reproduce into the space occupied by another loop. Thus, once a loop is surrounded, it is incapable of reproducing, resulting in a [[coral]]-like colony with a thin layer of reproducing organisms surrounding a core of inactive "dead" organisms. Unless provided unbounded space, the colony's size will be limited. The maximum population will be [[asymptote|asymptotic]] to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \left \lfloor \frac{A}{121} \right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, where ''A'' is the total area of the space in cells.

=== Encoding of the genome ===

The loops' genetic code is stored as a series of nonzero-zero state pairs. The standard loop's genome is illustrated in the picture at the top, and may be stated as a series of numbered states starting from the T-junction and running clockwise: 70-70-70-70-70-70-40-40. The '70' command advances the end of the wire by one cell, while the '40-40' sequence causes the left turn. State 3 is used as a temporary marker for several stages.

While the roles of states 0,1,2,3,4 and 7 are similar to Codd's CA, the remaining states 5 and 6 are used instead to mediate the loop replication process. After the loop has completed, state 5 travels counter-clockwise along the sheath of the parent loop to the next corner, causing the next arm to be produced in a different direction.  State 6 temporarily joins the genome of the daughter loop and initialises the growing arm at the next corner it reaches.

The genome is used a total of six times: once to extend the pseudopod to the desired location, four times to complete the loop, and again to [[DNA replication|transfer]] the genome into the daughter loop. Clearly, this is dependent on the fourfold [[rotational symmetry]] of the loop; without it, the loop would be incapable of containing the information required to describe it. The same use of symmetry for genome compression is used in many biological [[viruses]], such as the [[icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral]] [[adenovirus]].

{{Signs of death}}
'''Livor mortis''' ([[Latin]]: ''livor'' – "bluish color", ''mortis'' – "of death"), '''postmortem lividity''' (Latin: ''postmortem'' – "after death", ''lividity'' – "black and blue"), '''hypostasis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''hypo'', meaning "under, beneath"; ''stasis'', meaning "a standing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hypostasis|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hypostasis|work=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hypo-|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hypo-|work=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or '''suggillation''', is the fourth [[Stages of death|stage]] and one of the [[signs of death]]. It is a settling of the [[blood]] in the lower (dependent) portion of the body post mortem, causing a purplish red discoloration of the skin. When the heart stops functioning and is no longer agitating the blood, heavy red blood cells sink through the [[blood plasma|serum]] by action of gravity. The blood travels faster in hotter conditions (eg. a beach) and blood travels slower in colder conditions (eg. a mountain).

Livor mortis starts in 20–30 minutes, but is usually not observable by the [[human eye]] until two hours after death. The size of the patches increases in the next three to six hours, with maximum lividity occurring between eight and twelve hours after [[death]]. The blood pools into the [[interstitial fluid|interstitial tissues]] of the body. The intensity of the color depends upon the amount of reduced haemoglobin in the blood. The discoloration does not occur in the areas of the body that are in contact with the ground or another object, in which [[capillary|capillaries]] are compressed.&lt;ref name=ManualOfFO&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=WQVCCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=pallor+mortis+dark+skin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Oco_ZDStoB&amp;sig=7e7PGN0thLFUxQFiXz1DJtzMXH0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=pallor%2520mortis%2520dark%2520skin&amp;f=false|title=Manual of Forensic Odontology, Fifth Edition|last=Senn|first=David R.|last2=Weems|first2=Richard A.|date=2013-01-22|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1439851340|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicability==
[[Coroner]]s can use the presence or absence of livor mortis as a means of determining an approximate time of death. It can also be used by [[forensic science|forensic]] investigators to determine whether or not a body has been moved. For instance, if the body is found lying [[prone position|prone]], but the pooling is present on the deceased's back, investigators can conclude that the body was originally positioned [[supine position|supine]].&lt;ref name=ManualOfFO/&gt;

Among coroners and other investigators, such as [[Detective|homicide and forensic detectives]], livor mortis is not considered an exact way to measure time of death, but instead is a way to [[Approximation|approximate]] it. Livor mortis, along with [[algor mortis]], [[rigor mortis]], and practices such as [[forensic entomology]] are frequently combined by investigators to more accurately pinpoint the estimated time of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books/about/Forensic_Pathology_Second_Edition.html?id=XyG3802xSdwC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Forensic Pathology, Second Edition|last=DiMaio|first=Dominick|last2=DiMaio|first2=Vincent J.

'''Alonzo P. "Lon" Knight''', born '''Alonzo P. Letti''' (June 16, 1853 &amp;ndash; April 23, 1932), was an American [[right fielder]], right-handed [[pitcher]] and [[manager (baseball)|manager]] in [[Major League Baseball]]. He threw the first pitch in the first game played in the new [[National League]] on April 22, 1876.

Born in [[Philadelphia]] and a graduate of [[Girard College]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&amp;v=l&amp;pid=7644&amp;bid=715 Society for American Baseball Research biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202211957/http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&amp;v=l&amp;bid=715&amp;pid=7644 |date=2007-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he began playing with the [[Athletic of Philadelphia|Philadelphia Athletics]] in {{Baseball year|1875}} when the team was in the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]], then stayed with them when they joined the National League in 1876. When the team folded after the 1876 season, he did not play in the major leagues again until 1880, when he joined the [[Worcester Ruby Legs]] of the NL for one season, and the [[Detroit Wolverines]] for two. In {{Baseball year|1883}}, he was named the manager of the [[Philadelphia Athletics (American Association)|Philadelphia Athletics]] of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]], and the team won the league pennant with Knight also playing right field. In 1884 the team fell back to seventh place in a 13-team league. He finished his career in [[1885 in baseball|1885]] when he split the season between the Athletics and the [[Providence Grays]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/k/knighlo01.shtml Baseball-Reference player page]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 1880, he was playing right field at Riverside Park in [[Albany, New York]] when [[Lip Pike]] hit a ball over the fence and into the river. Few parks at the time had ground rules concerning balls hit over the fence. It was not an automatic [[home run]], so Knight pursued the ball in a boat, eventually giving up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1880 Baseball Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319073312/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1880 |date=2009-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Knight's playing career ended, he was an [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] for several seasons; his most active year was 1890, when he officiated 123 games in the [[Players' League]]. He umpired a total of 212 major league games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lon Knight|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/K/Pknigl101.htm|work=Retrosheet.org|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight died of poisoning at age 78 in Philadelphia when his [[natural gas|gas]] line sprung a leak. He is interred at [[Laurel Hill Cemetery]] in an unmarked grave in Section H, Lot 63-64.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=knighlo01 Baseball Almanac]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12319">'''Meat-free days''' are declared to discourage or prohibit the consumption of meat on certain days of the week. [[Meatless Monday|Mondays]] and [[Friday Fast|Fridays]] are the most popular days. There are also movements encouraging people giving up meat on a weekly, monthly, or permanent basis.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

== History ==
{{Further|Friday Fast}}
Abstention from meat was historically done for religious reasons (e.g. the [[Friday Fast]]). In the [[Methodist Church]], during [[Lent]] "abstinence from meat one day a week is a universal act of penitence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&amp;mid=2872 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310224612/http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&amp;mid=2872 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 March 2010 |title=What does The United Methodist Church say about fasting? |publisher=The United Methodist Church |accessdate=27 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anglican]]s (Episcopalians) and [[Roman Catholic]]s also traditionally observe Friday as a meat-free day.&lt;ref name="Buchanan2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Colin|title=The A to Z of Anglicanism|date=4 August 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810870086|page=182|quote=In the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, there is a list of "Days of Fasting, or Abstinence," consisting of the 40 days of Lent, the ember days, the three rogation days (the Monday to Wednesday following the Sunday after Ascension Day), and all Fridays in the year (except Christmas, if it falls on a Friday).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Green2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Jennifer|title=Dealing with Death: A Handbook of Practices, Procedures and Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jH2DrcY2DXMC&amp;pg=PA224|accessdate=27 April 2014|date=25 May 2006|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=9781846425127|page=224|quote=Friday is a day of abstinence and self-denial for Catholics in health, and, by tradition, this became a meat-free day.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, Anglican and Catholic countries enforced prohibitions on eating meat on certain days of Lent. In England, for example, "butchers and victuallers were bound by heavy recognizances not to slaughter or sell meat on the weekly 'fish days', Friday and Saturday."&lt;ref name="BarrowsRoom1991"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrows|first1=Susanna|last2=Room|first2=Robin|title=Drinking: Behavior and Belief in Modern History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-wmSdtGer0C&amp;pg=PA340|accessdate=27 April 2014|year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520070851|page=340|quote=The main legally enforced prohibition in both Catholic and Anglican countries was that against meat. During Lent, the most prominent annual season of fasting in Catholic and Anglican churches, authorities enjoined abstinence from meat and sometimes "white meats" (cheese, milk, and eggs); in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England butchers and victuallers were bound by heavy recognizances not to slaughter or sell meat on the weekly "fish days," Friday and Saturday.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], Wednesdays and Fridays are meat-free days.&lt;ref name="Vitz1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vitz|first=Evelyn Birge|title=A Continual Feast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hrdUYzuAO14C&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=27 April 2014|year=1991|publisher=Ignatius Press|isbn=9780898703849|page=80|quote=In the Orthodox groups, on ordinary Wednesdays and Fridays no meat, olive oil, wine, or fish can be consumed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Lutheran Church]], Fridays and Saturdays are historically considered meat-free days.&lt;ref name="Lund2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lund|first=Eric|title=Documents from the History of Lutheranism, 1517–1750|quote=Of the Eating of Meat: One should abstain from the eating of meat on Fridays and Saturdays, also in fasts, and this should be observed as an external ordinance at the command of his Imperial Majesty.|date=January 2002|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=9781451407747|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meat-free days have also been observed due to wartime rationing (e.g. Meatless Tuesdays in Canada&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.waterloo.on.ca/VeteransGreen/PrinterFriendly.aspx?tabid=1381 "Making Do with Less": Rationing in Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121216045606/http://www.city.waterloo.on.ca/VeteransGreen/PrinterFriendly.aspx?tabid=1381 |date=2012-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States—which also observed Wheatless Wednesdays—during [[World War I]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/food/the-history-kitchen/history-meatless-mondays/ |title=History of Meatless Mondays &amp;#124; The History Kitchen &amp;#124; PBS Food |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/23/the-way-we-ate-the-year-harry-truman-passed-on-pumpkin-pie/ The Way We Ate: The Year Harry Truman Passed on Pumpkin Pie]&lt;/ref&gt; or in states with [[shortage economy|failing economies]].

In the [[People's Republic of Poland]], meat-free days were encouraged by the government due to [[Market (economics)|market]] forces. They were aimed at limiting meat consumption, primarily in favour of [[flour]]-based foods. The meat-free day was traditionally Friday, Monday or Wednesday.

== Ecology and society ==
Attempts to reintroduce meat-free days are part of a campaign to reduce [[Global warming|anthropogenic climate change]] and improve human health and [[animal welfare]] by reducing [[factory farming]] and promoting [[vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]].

Post was born on 19 April 1869 in Harrison County, West Virginia, the son of Ira Carper Post, a wealthy farmer; his mother was Florence May (née Davisson).&lt;ref name=powell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Routledge|first1=Christopher|editor1-last=Powell|editor1-first=Stephen|title=100 American Crime Writers|date=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137031662|pages=281–282|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhfxt0UVz8cC&amp;pg=PA281|chapter=Post, Melville Davisson (1869-1930)|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post's family had settled in the [[Clarksburg, West Virginia]] area in the late 18th century, and &lt;ref name=moore /&gt; Post earned a law degree from [[West Virginia University]] in 1892.

===Personal life===
In 1903, he married Ann Bloomfield Gamble Schofield. Their only child (a son, Ira) died in infancy, after which Melville and Ann travelled in Europe. They later owned and managed a stable for [[Polo pony|polo ponies]].&lt;ref name=powell /&gt; Ann died of pneumonia in 1919.

===Death===
Post, an avid horseman, died on June 23, 1930, after a fall crash from his horse, and was buried in Harrison County.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Ken (ed.), ''The West Virginia Encyclopedia'', West Virginia Humanities Council, 2006. pg. 578&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Post's boyhood home, "[[Templemoor]]", was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==

===Randolph Mason===

Post wrote three volumes of stories about Randolph Mason, a brusque New York lawyer who is highly skilled at turning legal [[loopholes]] and [[legal technicality|technicalities]] to his clients' advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mallory|first1=Michael|title='The Man of Last Resort': the Outrageous World of Randolph Mason|journal=Mystery Scene|date=2005|volume=Fall|issue=91|url=https://www.mysteryscenemag.com/blog-article/2858-qthe-man-of-last-resortq-the-outrageous-world-of-randolph-mason|accessdate=29 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304122009/https://www.mysteryscenemag.com/blog-article/2858-qthe-man-of-last-resortq-the-outrageous-world-of-randolph-mason|archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first two volumes (''The Strange Schemes of Randolph Mason'' and ''The Man of Last Resort'', published 1896–1897), Mason is depicted as an utterly amoral character who advises criminals how to commit wrongdoings without breaking the [[letter of the law]]. The best-known of these stories is "The Corpus Delicti", in which Mason's client murders a [[blackmail]]ing lover and dissolves her dismembered corpse in acid. Despite overwhelming [[circumstantial evidence]], Mason secures his client's acquittal on the grounds that no body has been found and there are no eyewitnesses to the woman's death. (New York law at the time allowed one of the two conditions to be established by circumstantial evidence, but not both.)&lt;ref name=loerzel&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loerzel|first1=Robert|title=The Corpus Delicti|url=http://www.alchemyofbones.com/stories/corpus.htm|website=Alchemy of Bones|accessdate=2 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926221040/http://www.alchemyofbones.com/stories/corpus.htm|archivedate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post deflected criticism of such sensational stories by declaring that he was publicly exposing weaknesses in the law that needed to be rectified. Nevertheless, in a third volume (1908's ''The Corrector of Destinies''), Mason had become a reformed man who used his knowledge of the law for more beneficent purposes. Post explained Mason's change of character by stating the lawyer had been suffering from mental illness in the two earlier volumes.&lt;ref name=nevins /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Patricia J.|title=The Image of the Attorney: The Character of Attorney Randolph Mason in three books by Melville Davisson Post|date=2010|url=http://works.bepress.com/patricia_brown/1|website=Selected Works|publisher=Bepress|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uncle Abner ===

Uncle Abner is Post's best-known literary creation, the character, one of six detectives created by Post,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/252700230|title=Whodunit? : a who's who in crime &amp; mystery writing|last=Rosemary.|first=Herbert,|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=0195157613|location=|page=3|oclc=252700230|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; having appeared in 22 stories that were serialized in American magazines (primarily ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'') between 1911 and 1928. The first tale, "The Angel of the Lord", is perhaps the very first work in the [[historical mystery]] genre. Uncle Abner solved the mysteries that confronted him in a backwoods West Virginia community, immediately prior to the [[American Civil War]] and before the infant nation had any proper police system. He had two great attributes for his self-imposed task: a profound knowledge of and love for the [[Bible]], and a keen observation of human actions. One example of Uncle Abner's keen deductive skills is his showing a deaf man had not written a document, because a word in it was phonetically mis-spelt.&lt;ref name="Bottum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WVE 813"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Charles F.|title=Uncle Abner|url=http://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/813|website=e-WV: The West Virginia Encyclopedia|accessdate=5 January 2016|date=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ellery Queen]] would later call the stories "an out-of-this-world target for future detective-story writers." In his 1924 book of literary criticism ''Cargoes for Crusoes'', Grant Overton called the publication of Post's "The Doomdorf Mystery" a "major literary event", and in ''Murder for Pleasure'' (1941), Howard Haycraft called Uncle Abner  "the greatest American contribution" to the list of fictional detectives after [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s [[C. Auguste Dupin]].&lt;ref name="Bottum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WVE 813"/&gt; After Post's death, more stories about Abner were written (at the request of the Melville Davisson Post estate) by the retired American research chemist, John F. Suter (1914-1996).

===Other characters===

Besides Mason, Abner, and Walker, Post also created the detectives Sir Henry Marquis of Scotland Yard (''The Sleuth of St James Square'', 1920), the French policeman Monsieur Jonquelle (''Monsieur Jonquelle: Prefect of Police of Paris'', 1923), and the Virginia lawyer Colonel Braxton (''The Silent Witness'', 1930).

'''Michael James Todd''' [[Queen's Police Medal|QPM]] (10 August 1957 – 11 March 2008&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article3540685.ece Michael Todd: The Times obituary].  ''[[The Times]]''.  London.  12 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;) was [[Chief Constable]] of [[Greater Manchester Police]] from October 2002 until his death.

==Biography==
Todd grew up in Essex where he attended the [[Billericay School]] and later attended the [[University of Essex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.echo-news.co.uk/mostpopular.var.2111469.mostviewed.update_tributes_to_chief_constable.php | accessdate = 16 March 2008 |title=UPDATE: Tributes to Chief Constable}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with a [[first class honours]] degree in government in 1989 and a master's degree in [[political science|politics]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Profile: Mike Todd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/7290524.stm |work=BBC News |publisher= |date=11 March 2008 |accessdate=11 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Fahey |title=Michael Todd: profile |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/michael-todd-profile-794271.html |work=The Independent |publisher= |date=11 March 2008 |accessdate=11 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university named him the alumnus of the year in 2003 for his contributions to policing and the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Essex Alumni Website|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/alumni/|accessdate=15 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined [[Essex Police]] in 1976, and the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] on a management exchange programme.

Todd was appointed an Assistant Chief Constable in Nottinghamshire in 1995, initially managing support services and then operational policing. In 1998, he was appointed as the Deputy Assistant Commissioner back in the Metropolitan Police. In 2000, following his promotion to Assistant Commissioner in the Metropolitan Police, he was responsible for Territorial Policing, covering all 32 London Boroughs. In 2002, he was selected as Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police from 2002 and in 2006 he became a vice-president of ACPO ([[Association of Chief Police Officers]]), both posts he held until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Fahey |title=Michael Todd: profile |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/michael-todd-profile-794271.html |work=The Independent |publisher= |date=11 March 2008 |accessdate=22 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation of CIA extraordinary rendition flights===
Todd investigated on behalf of the Association of Chief Police Officers the [[extraordinary rendition]] flights conducted by the [[CIA]] to transport [[detainee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/09/nflight109.xml |title= Police deny 'extraordinary rendition' flights |publisher=Telegraph |date=10 June 2007 |accessdate=12 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taser demonstration===
Todd allowed himself to be hit by a [[taser]] in 2005 to demonstrate that the [[Electroshock weapon|stun guns]] were safe; this was an effort to have them more widely issued to police officers. "I couldn't move, it hurt like hell," he said after recovering. "I wouldn't want to do that again."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/manchester/4650645.stm Chief constable hit by Taser gun]. [[BBC News]]. 5 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation into malpractice===
In 2012, it was announced that Police officials are examining new claims of financial malpractice against Todd. Greater Manchester's new Police Commissioner appealed for information about Michael Todd, former chief constable of the force. The claims centre on Todd's role in drawing up unique contracts that allowed some staff to get enormous payoffs when they left the force. Tony Lloyd, a former Labour Foreign Office minister who has just been elected Police Commissioner for the force, is to be handed a report into allegations of possible financial malpractice, including 'golden goodbye' redundancy packages of up to £300,000. 

==Personal life==
He was married with three children, a daughter and twin boys.  His social interests included Warhammer (Space Marines), computer gaming and reading, particularly military and political biographies.

===Death===
After Todd was reported missing by Greater Manchester Police, rescue teams from [[Llanberis]], [[North Wales]], started a search for him at 01:00 on 11 March 2008. After being alerted by hill walkers who found personal possessions, they found Todd's body in the ''Bwlch Glas'' area of [[Snowdon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/7290359.stm |title=Top UK police chief is found dead |publisher=BBC |date=11 March 2008 |accessdate=10 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Autopsy|post-mortem]] report initially found "no obvious cause" of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30100-1308956,00.html | work = Sky News | title = No 'Obvious Cause' Of Top Cop's Death | accessdate = 12 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, [[Manchester]] [[Chamber of Commerce]] Chief Executive Angie Robinson was reported to have been having an affair with Todd. It was later revealed that he was conducting numerous affairs with up to 38 different women. Todd's widow Carolyn paid tribute to "a caring and loving father and husband."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | author2= | title=Todd inquest hears of drink level | date=13 March 2008 | publisher= | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/7294994.stm | work =BBC News | pages = | accessdate = 24 October 2008 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[inquest]] into his death was opened and adjourned on 13 March 2008. The inquest ruled that Todd had died from [[Hypothermia|exposure]], essentially freezing to death having been only lightly clothed on the slopes of Snowdon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | author2= | title=Widow forgives dead police chief | date=6 October 2008 | publisher= | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7655611.stm | work =BBC News | pages = | accessdate = 24 October 2008 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recurring miscarriage may increase the incidence of intrusive thoughts in women and their partners.&lt;ref name="daug" /&gt;

Miscarriage has an emotional effect and can also lead to [[psychological disorders]]. One disorder that can develop is primary maternal preoccupation. This [[psychological trauma]] can develop as a response to early pregnancy loss. [[Anxiety]] can also develop as a result of a miscarriage.&lt;ref name=sche&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheidt|first=CE|date=2007|title=Trauerverarbeitung nach Prä- und Perinatalverlust (Mourning processing after pre-and perinatal loss)|journal=Psychother Psych Med|volume=57|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1055/s-2006-951906|pmid=17357028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women describe the medical treatment that they receive contributed their distress.&lt;ref name= daug/&gt; Even if relatively low levels of [[Stress (biology)|stress]] occur after the miscarriage, symptoms of PTSD including [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]], [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] and [[Fight-or-flight response|hyperarousal]] can later develop.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}} [[Clinical depression]] also is associated with miscarriage.&lt;ref name = sche/&gt;

Intrusive thoughts can develop after the loss.&lt;ref name=Christiansen2017/&gt;{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}} Panic disorder and obsessive thoughts may also develop as a response to a miscarriage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Men may experience pain and psychological effects but react by adopting “compensatory behaviours” such as increasing consumption of alcohol. Because men can consider their role to be supportive, they may not have their loss recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Due|first=Clemence|last2=Chiarolli|first2=Stephanie|last3=Riggs|first3=Damien W.|date=2017-11-15|title=The impact of pregnancy loss on men's health and wellbeing: a systematic review|journal=BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth|volume=17|issue=1|pages=380|doi=10.1186/s12884-017-1560-9|pmid=29141591|pmc=5688642|issn=1471-2393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posttraumatic stress disorder==
Women who have had clinical depression before the miscarriage are more likely to develop PTSD.&lt;ref name=Christiansen2017/&gt;  [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] is associated with miscarriage along with other traumatic events associated with pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Christiansen2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christiansen|first1=DM|title=Posttraumatic stress disorder in parents following infant death: A systematic review|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|date=February 2017|volume=51|pages=60–74|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2016.10.007|pmid=27838460}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Martin|page = 26 }}&lt;ref name = kirs&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kersting|first=Anette|last2=Wagner|first2=Birgit|date=June 2012|title=Complicated grief after perinatal loss|url=|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=14|issue=2|pages=187–194|pmc=3384447|pmid=22754291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daugirdaitė|first1=V|last2=van den Akker|first2=O|last3=Purewal|first3=S|title=Posttraumatic stress and posttraumatic stress disorder after termination of pregnancy and reproductive loss: a systematic review|journal=Journal of Pregnancy|date=2015|volume=2015|pages=1-14|doi=10.1155/2015/646345|pmid=25734016|pmc=4334933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Those who experience recurrent miscarriage (&gt;3) have a greater risk of developing PTSD than those who have experienced miscarriage once.&lt;ref name=Christiansen2017/&gt; An association between the gender of the infant lost through miscarriage exists whereby there is an increased chance of developing PTSD if the infant was a male. Knowing the cause of the miscarriage does not reduce the risk of developing PTSD. Finding a 'meaning' for the loss reduces the risk of developing PTSD. A negative outlook regarding the world in general is corrlated with increased levels of PTSD. Poor self-esteem is also related to developing PTSD after the loss. If memories of the loss are considered intense, risk for PTSD is increased. There are concerns that PTSD in mothers may have a negative impact on children born after the event.&lt;ref name=Christiansen2017/&gt;

Though the development of PTSD in women and families after the loss has been identified, the presence of PTSD in a woman who is pregnant is detrimental. Women with PTSD are thought to be at a higher risk of prenatal loss, perinatal loss, pregnancy complications, ectopic pregnancy, preterm birth and growth abnormalities in the fetus.&lt;ref name=Christiansen2017/&gt;

PTSD in a mother is suspected to increase the risk of autism, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes in a child.&lt;ref name=Christiansen2017/&gt;

==Depression and anxiety==
43% of women who miscarry are found to have depression, anxiety disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.&lt;ref name = rand/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/880941778|title=Women's reproductive mental health across the lifespan|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Lynn-Barnes, Diana,|isbn=9783319051161|location=Cham|pages=|oclc=880941778 |postscript =  (online text, no page numbers)|last1=Barnes|first1=Diana Lynn|date=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--and [[bipolar disorder]].{{mcn|date=October 2017}} [[ Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R)]] has been used to quantify the severity of a miscarriage and 47.5% of the women experiencing a miscarriage have high scores. Follow-up determined that even after 2 years, 2.6% of women still have high impact scores.{{mcn|date=October 2017}}--&gt;

[[Prolonged grief disorder|Complicated grief]] is an [[Atypical depression|atypical]] response to a miscarriage. It differs from the more common form of [[Miscarriage and grief|grief]] that occurs after a miscarriage. The [[Kübler-Ross model|grieving process]] associated with other events such as the loss of a spouse or parent is expected to decline in a predictable and steady rate. This not true for those experiencing grief after a miscarriage because only 41% follow the expected decline in grief while most (59%) do not fit this pattern.&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/06/miscarriage.aspx|title=Miscarriage and loss|publisher = American Psychological Association  | date = 2017 |language=en|access-date=2017-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cognitive behavioral therapy|Cognitive Behavior Therapy]] has been found to be helpful if it is begun immediately after the loss.&lt;ref name=Christiansen2017/&gt;

== Epidemeology ==
A woman who miscarries has a 2.5 times greater risk for depression than those who have not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In the US, estimates of PTSD related to miscarriage are thought to be 150,000–200,000 acute and 24,000–32,000 chronic PTSD cases. PTSD in fathers may be significant but remains unaddressed.&lt;ref name=Christiansen2017/&gt;

'''Motormouth''' ('''Harley Davis''') is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] created by [[Paul Neary]] and developed by writer Graham Marks with initial designs by [[Gary Frank]] ([[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Supreme Power]], [[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]). As the title character of her own series, ''Motormouth'' (later '''''Motormouth &amp; [[Killpower]]'''''), was part of a line of original comics released in the early-to-mid [[1990s in comics|1990s]] by [[Marvel UK]]. She is a teenage street-rat from [[London]], [[England]] with a fierce temper who curses constantly. She is 5&amp;nbsp;ft 4&amp;nbsp;in (1.62&amp;nbsp;m) tall and weighs roughly 7&amp;nbsp;st 7&amp;nbsp;lb / {{convert|105|lb|abbr=on}}.

==Publication history==
''Motormouth'' ran for twelve issues with Harley and later her partner [[Killpower]] going to various [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternative realities]] from the regular [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Harley is orphaned at age 11 and grows up as part of a gang that lives in the East End of [[London]]. They survive by foraging and stealing. Her incredibly foul language earns her the nickname "Motormouth". When she is seventeen, Harley is discovered by Laarson, an agent of [[Mys-Tech]], the shadowy organisation that featured in all of Marvel UK's 1990s titles. Harley is a candidate for his MOPED (Mind Operated PErsonal Dematerialization) technology. This allows people to jump between alternative realities but will only operate on people with certain strands of [[DNA]]. The unit is disguised as a pair of training shoes, which Harley finds and tries on. At the same time Laarson is being executed by Mys-Tech's Techno-Wizards and agents were sent to find the MOPED units. In order to save her and the units, Laarson's subordinates activate the technology and send her to another universe.&lt;ref&gt;''Motormouth'' #2 (July 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

While still on the run from Mys-Tech, Harley is sent to a future in which the world was covered in shopping malls. It was here she purchases a Soni-Muta 500 Unit, a [[integrated circuit|microchip]] that allows her to mentally tune in to any radio station she wanted. This would later give her her sonic scream. Harley returns to her own universe and is captured and put to work by Mys-Tech. She escapes after a mission to Tokyo, Japan.&lt;ref&gt;''Motormouth'' #3 (August 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Killpower===
She has to make a random jump in order to escape and ends up on a planet named Tekron. [[Killpower]], an agent of [[Mys-Tech]], is sent to find her. Unable to escape him, Harley reasons with the man instead. Mentally little more than a small child, Killpower becomes intrigued by Harley and joins her as her partner. Harley is then badly injured on Tekron when a stray bullet hit her in the throat. Killpower uses her Soni-Muta 500 and the MOPED technology to cure her. This not only gave her the aforementioned sonic scream, she could now travel between universes without the aid of technology. Both are then forced to flee from Mys-Tech's influence.&lt;ref&gt;''Motormouth'' #4 (September 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Motormouth and Killpower appeared in the ''Battletide'' mini-series. [[Death's Head#Death's Head II|Death's Head]] is hired by Mys-Tech to retrieve Killpower. While the two fought, Motormouth and [[Tuck (comics)|Tuck]] (Death's Head partner) went on a shopping spree on an alien planet. Motormouth and Killpower later plan an attack on  Tyburn, a powerful Mys-Tech agent. Harley is able to steal their MOPED unit and neutralize the tracking devices Mys-Tech had implanted in the duo. Tyburn survives the attack.&lt;ref&gt;''Battletide'' #1-4 (December 1992 - March 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saving the world===
Motormouth becomes an essential part of the ''Mys-Tech Wars'' mini-series. At first, she is just one of many superheroes attacking the main Mys-Tech complex, hoping to take down the Techno-Wizards, the heads of Mys-Tech.&lt;ref&gt;''Mys-Tech Wars'' #2 (April 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

The wizards fight back successfully, slaughtering most of the heroes. Death-Head kills them in return. Unfortunately this endangers all of Earth. A fortunate fall from Killpower allows six heroes, Motormouth included, to break free of the melee and patch themselves into the required equipment so they can save the Earth from destruction. The others, such as [[Doctor Strange]] and [[Professor X]], bring powerful forces to the mix. Motormouth ends up simply sitting in the sixth chair to fill out the required number of entities.&lt;ref&gt;''Mys-Tech Wars'' #4 (June 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth is saved and time is reversed, undoing all the deaths that have occurred. Only the last six remember any of which had happened.&lt;ref&gt;''Mys-Tech Wars'' #4 (June 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time Guardian and the Hulk===
In the ''[[Dark Guard]]'' mini-series, both Motormouth and Killpower are recruited by the Time Guardian to help stop a war on the planet Eopia. The war had been caused by Tyburn and [[Mys-Tech]] agents have infiltrated both sides of the war. Motormouth is instrumental in stopping a powerful Mys-Tech agent called Collapsar who had captured Killpower. Her extra-sensory vision allowed her to see microfractures in his torso which in turn allowed [[Death's Head#Death's Head II|Death's Head]] to smash him.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Guard'' #4 (January 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Motormouth and Killpower guest-starred in an issue of ''[[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]]'', illustrated by Motormouth's co-creator [[Gary Frank]]. The Hulk literally falls onto their dinner table. This is after the Hulk fights the villain [[Madman (Marvel Comics)|Madman]]. Killpower and Hulk briefly fight. The Hulk proves himself more than a match for her obscene language. The trio team up to rescue [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] from Madman, who had taken him up the side of [[Big Ben]]. Though he is dropped off the side, Charles escapes injury. In the ensuing battle, Harley accidentally brings down [[London Bridge]] and Madman escapes.&lt;ref&gt;''The Incredible Hulk'' #408-409 (August–September 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Motormouth and Killpower came under the attention of Nigel Orpington-Smythe, leader of the [[R.C.X.]] a British Intelligence Agency from the comic book ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]].'' Security footage stills of the two were shown to [[Captain Britain]] as an example of the lawless vigilantism that Smythe sought to control. R.C.X was neutralized before they became a threat to Harley.&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' #64-#65 (April–May 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Issue #12, the last of the series, features Motormouth visiting a homeless encampment on the South Side of the River Thames in London, England. It's revealed she used to live there, though she did not enjoy it. The two heroes, along with [[Death's Head]], defeat and kill a murderous [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M]]. construct that had taken on the mannerisms of the local homeless population. The second part of the issue features the two battling fanatical, naive worshippers of a lost alien being. In defeating the being, Killpower becomes the world's new god.&lt;ref&gt;''Motormouth And Killpower'' #12 (May, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-series appearances===
Two new stories were planned before Marvel UK fell. ''Motormouth versus Removal Man'' was partially drawn and had her fighting a Mys-Tech assassin who made his targets never exist in the first place (boasting one of his finest jobs was the [[Fantastic Four|Fantastic Five]]). ''Motormouth Remix'' would have had her hopping through alternate realities looking for Killpower and running into versions of Marvel US characters, to connect Marvel UK more to their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://downthetubes.net/?page_id=10749 Down the Tubes: "Genesis ’92″: Looking Back and What Might Have Been"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Harley has since had a cameo appearance in the ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' mini-series.&lt;ref&gt;''Avenger Forever'' #11-#12 (November 1999, February 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time later, she becomes a reserve agent for [[MI-13 (comics)|MI:13]]. While trying to rescue [[Faiza Hussain]]'s parents, she was hospitalised. [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captain Britain and MI-13'' #11&lt;/ref&gt;

When Mys-Tech tried to send all of Britain to Hell, Motormouth and Killpower fought at the Battle of London Bridge. She was also sucked into Hell but Killpower saved her and the other heroes, leaving himself trapped in the inferno.&lt;ref&gt;''Revolutionary War: Alpha'' by Andy Lanning, Alan Cowsill and Rich Elson (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Harley was left depressed and quit MI:13, living instead on a council estate in London, where she was known for her work fighting the vampire invasion. She became the single mother to two children, Victoria and Albert (named after pubs), and every so often she'd be attacked by (and kill) a former Mys-Tech monster who thought she was an easy target. After one attack, she learned her children were psychic mutants who were removing her memories of the monsters to stop her being sad.

She temporarily rejoined MI:13 &lt;ref&gt;''Revolutionary War: Motormouth'', by Glenn Dakin and Ronan Cliquet(2014)&lt;/ref&gt;
and led an army of British heroes to the Shard to fight an invasion from Hell. To Harley's shock, it turned out Hell's leader was a transformed Killpower, who had been manipulated by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] into believing she'd abandoned him. Killpower tried to kill her but her sonic scream managed to clear his mind; realising he'd been made into "a bad man", he allowed Britain's super-soldiers to kill him. A distraught Harley was approached by Nick Fury to join SHIELD (and angrily chewed him out).&lt;ref&gt;''Revolutionary War: Omega'', by Andy Lanning, Alan Cowsill and Rich Elson (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
A future version of Harley appears in ''Excalibur'' #67 (July 1993). Working with other heroes to protect an enclave of innocent people, she steps up to battle a wave of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]. Both sides inflict heavy casualties. Harley is one of the many disintegrated by the robot's weapons.

==Powers and abilities==

Harley can create deafening sounds and force blasts by screaming or shouting, similar to the [[X-Men|X-Men's]] [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] or [[DC Comics]]' [[Black Canary]]. By humming at a high pitch, she can use [[ultrasound]] to see through solid objects. She can also jump between [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s using the MOPED technology built into her. This technology also allows her to sense threats outside her normal field or range of senses. She also seems to have some ability to sense various forms of energy.

'''Amy Renee Mihaljevic''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ᵻ|ˈ|h|ɑː|l|ə|v|ɪ|k|audio=Mihaljevic IPA.ogg}}; December 11, 1978 – October 27, 1989) was a ten-year-old American elementary school student who was kidnapped and murdered in the U.S. state of [[Ohio]] in 1989. Her murder case received national attention. The story of her [[cold case|unsolved]] kidnapping and murder was presented by [[John Walsh (television host)|John Walsh]] on the television show ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' during the program's early years. To date, her killer has not been found, yet the case remains active; new information in 2007 and 2013 has increased hopes of resolving the case.&lt;ref name=mom/&gt;

== Disappearance and murder ==
On October 27, 1989, Amy Mihaljevic was kidnapped from the Bay Square Shopping Center in [[Bay Village, Ohio]], a [[Greater Cleveland|suburb of Cleveland]].&lt;ref name=mom/&gt; The abductor had contacted Mihaljevic by telephone and arranged to meet her on the pretext of buying a gift for her mother because she had recently been promoted, as he told her.&lt;ref name="RunkleRenner"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Renner|first1=James|title=The FBI Finally Has A Top Suspect In The Amy Mihaljevic Murder. We Got To Him First.|url=http://www.clevescene.com/cleveland/person-of-interest/Content?oid=1521269 |publisher=Cleveland Scene|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 8, 1990, the girl's body was found in a field, close to the road, off County Road 1181, [[Ruggles Township, Ashland County, Ohio|Ruggles Township]] in rural [[Ashland County, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=mom/&gt;&lt;ref name=pd&gt;{{cite news |first=Brent |last=Larkin |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Still on the hunt for Amy's killer |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;p_product=NewsBank&amp;p_text_direct-0=document_id=(%2011A0245E76AE8130%20)&amp;p_docid=11A0245E76AE8130&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_queryname=11A0245E76AE8130&amp;f_openurl=yes&amp;p_nbid=M43F48JAMTIxNTA0MTM5NC42OTE4Nzg6MToxMjoxOTguMzAuMjI4LjA&amp;&amp;p_multi=CPDB |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |publisher= |date=June 24, 2007 |accessdate=July 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence found at the scene of the crime suggests that Mihaljevic's body was probably dumped there shortly after her abduction. Based on findings by the Cuyahoga County coroner, Mihaljevic's last meal was some sort of soy substance, possibly an artificial chicken product or Chinese food.

==Investigation==
[[File:Amysuspect.gif|thumb|left|Wanted poster and FBI sketch of the man last seen with Mihaljevic before she vanished]]

The Bay Village Police and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] conducted an extensive investigation into her disappearance and murder. The case generated thousands of leads. Dozens of suspects were asked to take lie-detector tests, but no one has ever been charged with the crime. Law enforcement continues to pursue leads and monitor suspects to the present day. 20,000 interviews have taken place during the investigation.&lt;ref name=unfinished/&gt; This was described to be the biggest search in Ohio since the [[disappearance of Beverly Potts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Larkin|first1=Brent|title=Investigators still chasing Amy Mihaljevic's killer: Brent Larkin|url=http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2012/09/investigators_still_chasing_am.html|accessdate=September 25, 2014|agency=Northeast Ohio Media Group|date=September 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, it was revealed that several other young girls had received phone calls similar to that to which Mihaljevic responded, during the weeks prior to her abduction in 1989. These comprised requests from an unknown man, claiming to work with their mother, asking the girl to help him shop for a present to celebrate her mother's job promotion. The girls who received these calls lived in [[North Olmsted, Ohio|North Olmsted]], a suburb near Bay Village; some had unlisted phone numbers.&lt;ref name=unfinished/&gt;  This new information was considered significant  by new movement on the case.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.times-gazette.com/news/article/1577942?page=0 |title=Ashland County's murder mystery: Author James Renner explores killing of Amy Mihaljevic |first=Irv |last=Oslin |date=February 8, 2007 |publisher=Times-Gazette |location=Ashland, Ohio |accessdate=November 29, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208094604/http://www.times-gazette.com/news/article/1577942?page=0 |archive-date=February 8, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mihaljevic and the others who received such calls had all visited the local [[Cleveland Metroparks|Lake Erie Nature and Science Center]], which had a visitors' logbook by the front door that the girls may have signed, possibly adding other personal information such as addresses.&lt;ref name=unfinished/&gt;

Bay Village police collected [[DNA]] samples from several potential suspects in the case in December 2006.  As of early 2007, it was reported that a longtime suspect in the case had retained legal counsel.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;

The FBI announced in March 2014 that a $25,000 reward is available to anyone who can provide information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the killer of  Mihaljevic.&lt;ref&gt;The Plain Dealer, March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013, investigator Phil Torsney returned from retirement to work on the case, which he had originally been assigned to after she was murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dissell|first1=Rachel|title=Retired FBI agent Phil Torsney returns to tackle unsolved murder of Amy Mihaljevic|url=http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2013/11/post_1.html#incart_river_default|accessdate=September 25, 2014|agency=The Plain Dealer|date=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torsney is well known for aiding in the capture of [[Whitey Bulger]], who was a long-time member of the [[FBI Top Ten Most Wanted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We Will Catch Amy Mihaljevic's Murderer|url=http://www.amymihaljevic.blogspot.com/2014/05/torsney-well-solve-this.html|accessdate=September 2, 2014|agency=WKYC News|publisher=[[NBC]]|date=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torsney stated that he believes that Mihaljevic was transported out of Bay Village after she was kidnapped, as the town is "too dense, too close-knit, to be a likely place to commit murder." However, he stated that the murder likely took place in Ashland County, which the murderer was probably familiar with.&lt;ref name=unfinished/&gt;

In 2016, a blanket and curtain were discovered that had dog hairs similar to the Mihaljevic's dog. They were possibly used to conceal the victim's body before she was left in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Huffman |first1=William |title=Picture’s of the New Evidence Released in 2016; Plus New Audio Clip |url=https://whokilledamymihaljevic.com/2018/08/08/pictures-of-the-new-evidence-released-in-2016/ |accessdate=October 12, 2018 |work=Who Killed Amy Mihaljevic? |date=August 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2018, police announced a possible link between Mihaljevic and [[Joseph Newton Chandler III|Robert Nichols]], a man who initially remained unidentified after his 2002 suicide due to the fact that he had stolen a deceased child's identity in 1978. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McPadden |first1=Michael |title=Is ID Thief Robert Nichols Connected to the 1989 Ohio Murder of 10-Year-Old? |url=https://www.investigationdiscovery.com/crimefeed/murder/is-id-thief-robert-nichols-connected-to-the-1989-ohio-murder-of-10-year-old |accessdate=October 12, 2018 |work=Investigation Discovery |agency=Crime Feed |date=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols resided in Ohio during the last decades of his life.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news-herald.com/general-news/20180621/joseph-newton-chandler-iiis-true-identity-is-robert-ivan-nichols-but-authorities-still-dont-know-why|title=Joseph Newton Chandler III’s true identity is Robert Ivan Nichols, but authorities still don’t know why|last=Cass|first=Andrew|date=June 21, 2018|work=The News-Herald|access-date=June 22, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In response to her daughter's death, Mihaljevic's mother, Margaret McNulty, co-founded a foundation to protect children from such situations that happened to Amy. However, McNulty had suffered from lupus after the death of Amy, resulting in her death at age 54 in 2001.&lt;ref name=mom&gt;{{cite news|title=Mom of slain girl found dead in Vegas|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-0FF67919D7C73767.html|accessdate=May 15, 2014|newspaper=Post-Tribune|date=October 2, 2001}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nandigram violence''' was an incident in [[Nandigram]] in the [[West Bengal]] state of [[India]], in the aftermath of a failed project by the [[Government of West Bengal|Government of West-Bengal]] under the erstwhile Communist rule to acquire land for SEZ (Special Economic Zone).

The policy led to an insurgency in the region, followed by the death of 14 people by the Police Forces.

This incident played an important role in the politics of West Bengal for the next few years. Mamata Banerjee and her political party widely mentioned this issue along with the political war cry ''[[Ma Mati Manush]]'' in their election campaigns.

Later the CBI gave a clean chit to the entire Buddhadeb Bhattacharya govt on Nandigram firing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/CBI-clean-chit-to-Buddha-govt-on-Nandigram-firing/articleshow/29581354.cms|title=CBI clean chit to Buddha govt on Nandigram firing - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The SEZ controversy started when the government of West Bengal decided that the [[Salim Group]] of Indonesia&lt;ref&gt;For more information on the Salim Group please see [[Sudono Salim]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/97/0822/biz1.html|title=Asia Week|publisher=Asia Week|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saliltripathi.com/articlesReview/8Oct98Review.html|title=Far Easter Economic Review October 1998|date=8 October 1998|publisher=Saliltripathi.com|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; would set up a [[Chemical industry|chemical hub]] under the SEZ policy at [[Nandigram]].

But farmers of the locality were adamant that they did not want to give up their land and agitated under the banner of Bhoomi Raksha Committee which was baking up by Maoists. While the then-governor was on air and no contact was available with him, the police entered the Nandigram area and violence erupted. The West Bengal government's plan was to expropriate {{convert|10000|acre|ha}} of land for a [[Special Economic Zone]] (SEZ) to be developed by the Indonesian-based [[Salim Group]] for the industrialisation. In the police shootings at least 14 villagers were killed and 70 more wounded.

The [[Bhumi Uchhed Pratirodh Committee]], an organisation formed by the Maoists reacted antagonistically to the news. They blocked the roads leading to the Nandigram area and for a period of 3 months from January to March 2007. A number of FIRs were registered at Nandigram and Khejuri police stations, relating to violence, arson, loot and murder, etc. But the cases registered could not be investigated by the local police as the local police were unable to enter into the villages during the standoff. Thousands of supporters of the Left parties got attacked and were made refugees to be accommodated at shelter camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1070610/asp/frontpage/story_7902741.asp|title=First trickle of a homecoming - 18 pro-CPM families back in Nandigram after five months|last=Siddiqui|first=Imran|date=10 June 2007|newspaper=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the villagers' objection to and protest against the acquisition of land in Nandigram for the proposed chemical hub, the State Government gave in to the demands of BUPC and finally announced the cancellation of the project in the first week of March. But the situation hardly showed any improvement. A team of policemen had been sent to dissuade people from digging up roads. One police officer, Sadhucharan Chatterjee, aged 59, was killed while trying to repair a road dug up by protesters, and twelve other policemen were very seriously injured.

==The events of 14 March 2007==
The administration was finally directed to break the Maoist-backed {{Clarify|date=August 2013}} BUPC's control of Nandigram and a massive operation with at least 3,000 policemen was launched on 14 March 2007. However, prior information of the impending action somehow leaked out to the BUPC who amassed a crowd of roughly 5,000 villagers at the entry points into Nandigram to oppose the entry of police and assault them. In the resulting mayhem, at least 14 people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://telegraphindia.com/1070319/asp/frontpage/story_7537027.asp|title=Stockpile squad trail heads towards party – Phone records spill Nandigram secret|date=19 March 2007|work=The Telegraph|location=Calcutta, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immediate aftermath==
The deaths in Nandigram have led to a great deal of controversy on the [[Left-wing politics|left]] in India.&lt;ref name="isj"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=333&amp;issue=115|title=Nandigram and the deformations of the Indian left|date=2 July 2007|work=[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal police say they have recovered many bullets of a type not used by police but in widespread use in the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6497213.stm|title=Questions over Bengal shootings|date=26 March 2007|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few journalists were able to access the area, with their access being restricted by 'checkposts' manned by CPI(M) cadres;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/NEWS/India/Nandigram_Mediapersons_roughed_up_by_CPM_activists/articleshow/1764403.cms|title=Nandigram: Mediapersons roughed up by CPM activists - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; two belonging to a news channel were briefly abducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taratv.com/top_story1.html|title=taratv.com|website=www.taratv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately following the 14 March killings, voluntary teams of doctors visited the Nandigram health centre, the district hospital at [[Tamluk]] and later, the SSKM hospital and compiled a comprehensive report&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanhati.com/front-page/180/ Medical Team Report from Nandigram with names, locations, and injuries – 5 April].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gopal Krishna Gandhi]], The Governor of [[West Bengal]] criticised the state government over its handling of the Nandigram incident, speaking of his "cold horror" in a press statement.

== Reactions ==
Dr. Ashok Mitra, long time Finance Minister of the Government of West Bengal (and a veteran CPI(M) leader) criticised the government and his party stating that till death he will remain guilty to his conscience if he keeps mum on the happenings in Nandigram. He states that the CPI(M) leadership is blind of hubris and the party has turned into a wide open field of flatterers and court jesters dominated by 'anti-socials'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanhati.com/articles/446/|title=You are not what you were – Ashok Mitra after 14th November, 2007|website=sanhati.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial in ''[[The Indian Express]]'' said that the party machinery has become the "sword arm of an industrialisation policy that involves settling complicated property rights issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/story/25736.html|title=Latest News, Breaking News India, Today Headlines, Election Results 2018 Live News - The Indian Express|website=www.indianexpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the armed men who fired at the villagers, but were not part of the police, were later caught by security forces and found to be working for the CPI(M).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telegraphindia.com/1070319/asp/frontpage/story_7537027.asp|title=Stockpile squad trail heads towards party - Phone records spill Nandigram secret|website=telegraphindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renowned novelist [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]], a friend of the Chief Minister [[Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee]] also felt that the industry is necessary but state violence was barbaric.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyindia.com/show/125770.php/Nandigram-action-barbaric-but-industry-necessary:-Sunil-Gangopadhayay|title=Daily India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social activist [[Medha Patkar]] had visited Nandigram on 7 December 2006 to protest against land acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaenews.com/india/20061207/31650.htm|title=Latest news from India - India eNews|website=www.indiaenews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other renowned persons who joined protests against the project and the actions carried out on 14 March 2007 to implement it include [[Magsaysay]] and [[Jnanpeeth]] Award-winning author [[Mahasweta Devi]], [[Booker Prize]]-winner [[Arundhati Roy]], film director and actress [[Aparna Sen]], theatre personalities Shaonli Mitra and Bibhas Chakraborty, painter Suvaprasanna, songwriter and singer [[Kabir Suman]] and many others.

The scale of the action left the state stunned. [[All India Trinamool Congress]] estimates put the toll at 50. The PWD Minister of the Government of West Bengal, Mr. Kshiti Goswami of the [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)]] (RSP), a Left Front constituent, said 50 bodies were taken to hospital, but it was impossible to ascertain how many were actually dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Nandigram_turns_blood_red/articleshow/1764786.cms Nandigram turns Blood Red]&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, people singled out as CPI(M) members and supporters and their families were driven out of the area by the locals and their houses burnt. A week after the 14 March clashes, ''[[The Hindu]]'' estimated that around 3500 persons had been displaced into relief camps as a result of threats from BUPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/03/21/stories/2007032121811600.htm|title=Nandigram victims narrate their tales of woe|date=21 March 2007|work=The Hindu|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations by Trinamool Congress that hundreds of people have been killed in the event were not confirmed by facts. Ex Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said that two of the supposed victims, as claimed by Trinamool Congress, were later found in a completely safe place elsewhere in West Bengal.

The CPI(M) adopted the public position that land acquisition will not be made without the consent of the people of Nandigram. The proposed SEZ was ostensibly shelved following the 14 March [[police action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thestatesman.net/page.arcview.php?clid=1&amp;id=177504&amp;usrsess=1 |title=''The Statesman'' |access-date=25 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120557/http://www.thestatesman.net/page.arcview.php?clid=1&amp;id=177504&amp;usrsess=1 |archive-date=29 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The local, district and State administration have however maintained that the Chemical Hub will take place at Nandigram itself.

The CPI(M) has accused the [[Jami Raksha Committee]] – a coalition of activists from various parties who oppose land acquisition – of armed attacks on relief camps which led to three deaths as well as a series of murders and a gangrape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpim.org/statement/2007/03192007_nandigram.htm|title=nandigram&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|access-date=23 March 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703225719/http://cpim.org/statement/2007/03192007_nandigram.htm|archive-date=3 July 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International expressed serious concern that the Government of West Bengal has not taken the necessary concrete steps to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction are protected from forced eviction and displacement, and that all those forcibly displaced during the violence are ensured at the very least minimum essential levels of food, shelter, water and sanitation, health care and education, as well as their right to voluntary return or resettlement, and reintegration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&amp;id=ENGASA200012008|title=Report on Nandigram by Amnesty International: Urgent need to address large scale human rights abuses during Nandigram recapture|publisher=|access-date=2 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528231114/http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&amp;id=ENGASA200012008|archive-date=28 May 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judicial response ==
The [[High Courts of India|High Court]] at [[Calcutta]], when, on 16 November 2007, a Division Bench consisting of The Hon'ble Chief Justice S. S. Nijjar, and the Hon'ble Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose, declared that "The action of the police department to open fire at Nandigram on 14 March 2007 was wholly unconstitutional and cannot be justified under any provision of the law" and further that "The action of the police cannot be protected or justified on the ground of sovereign immunity" and also that "The action of the police cannot be justified even under the provisions of Criminal Procedure Code; The Police Act, 1861 for The Police Regulations, 1943". The Hon'ble judges also ordered the State of West Bengal to pay to the victims of the deceased as a result of the undiscriminating police firing on 14 March 2007 immediate compensation in the sum of Rs.5 (five) lakhs each" and further that "We further direct the State Government to pay immediate compensation to the persons who were injured and whose particulars have been given the pleadings sum of Rs. not less than 1 (one) [[lakh]] each" and also "We further direct the State Government to pay compensation to the victims of rape who have been duly identified in the pleadings a sum of Rs.2 (two) lakhs each".

==Location shift==
After the bloodshed at Nandigram, and the stiff resistance from opposition parties such as [[All India Trinamool Congress]] and [[Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist)]] (SUCI) and [[Left Front (West Bengal)|Left Front]] partners such as [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)|Revolutionary Socialist Party]] and [[All India Forward Bloc]] over land acquisition, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on 3 September expressed the government's preference for the sparsely populated island of [[Nayachar]], 30 kilometres from Haldia, to set up the desired chemical hub.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Nandigrams_chemical_hub_shifted_to_Nayachar/rssarticleshow/2335936.cms|title=Nandigram's chemical hub shifted to Nayachar - India - The Times of India|website=timesofindia.indiatimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconeer.com/past_issues/2007/siliconeer_april_2007.html#Anchor--COV-59625|title=Siliconeer: April 2007 - Real Estate Loans and Finance Special Issue|website=www.siliconeer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==November 2007 violence==
A fresh round of violence came up in November 2007, as the villagers who were thrown out of Nandigram by the BUPC returned home. The return of the villagers was marred by violence unleashed by the ruling party cadres over the resisting BUPC cadre in Nandigram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flonnet.com/stories/20071207508512100.htm |accessdate=27 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123000100/http://flonnet.com/stories/20071207508512100.htm |archivedate=23 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The party eulogised the operation with its state chairman describing it as 'a new dawn' and the chief minister as 'paying them back in their own coin'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070032822&amp;ch=11%2F14%2F2007+9%3A18%3A00+PM |title=NDTV.com: Buddhadeb defends 'Nandigram takeover' |date=2008-06-19 |access-date=2016-10-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619024443/http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070032822&amp;ch=11%2F14%2F2007%209%3A18%3A00%20PM |archivedate=19 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last comment was directed presumably primarily at the extreme-left [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)|Maoist]] activists who, the CPI(M) claims, were active at Nandigram and the situation was described as one of "[[Red Terror]]".&lt;ref name=" TIMESOFINDIANANDIGRAM"&gt;{{cite web |title=Red terror continues Nandigram's bylanes|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 November 2007, [[National Human Rights Commission of India]] sent notice to Chief Secretary, West Bengal, directing him to submit a factual report within 10 days on the conditions prevailing in Nandigram and around after  Social activist [[Medha Patkar]] said that war like situation prevailed in Nandigram due to continual presence of thousands of CPM cadres on all sides and accusations of police officers, present in the area  supporting their programme &lt;ref name="NHRCNANDIGRAM"&gt;{{cite web |title=NHRC sends notice to Chief Secretary, West Bengal, on Nandigram incidents: investigation team of the Commission to visit the area|url=http://nhrc.nic.in/dispArchive.asp?fno=1499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film director [[Aparna Sen]] and [[Rituporno Ghosh]] decided to boycott the film festival in Kolkata in protest against the renewed violence&lt;ref name="HTNANDIGRAM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=1cfd3f6f-48d6-45b3-b223-f0d38d473d80&amp;MatchID1=4626&amp;TeamID1=1&amp;TeamID2=6&amp;MatchType1=1&amp;SeriesID1=1165&amp;MatchID2=4632&amp;TeamID3=5&amp;TeamID4=10&amp;MatchType2=1&amp;SeriesID2=1167&amp;PrimaryID=4626&amp;Headline=CPM+cadres+kill+3+in+Nandigram |title=CPM cadres kill 3 in Nandigram |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417042941/http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=1cfd3f6f-48d6-45b3-b223-f0d38d473d80&amp;MatchID1=4626&amp;TeamID1=1&amp;TeamID2=6&amp;MatchType1=1&amp;SeriesID1=1165&amp;MatchID2=4632&amp;TeamID3=5&amp;TeamID4=10&amp;MatchType2=1&amp;SeriesID2=1167&amp;PrimaryID=4626&amp;Headline=CPM+cadres+kill+3+in+Nandigram |archivedate=17 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aparna Sen said, "Nandigram has become a slaughter house with blood being shed every day. CPM might be at the helm of affairs but the state still belongs to us."&lt;ref name="HTNANDIGRAM" /&gt;

The [[Parliament of India]] decided to discuss Nandigram with urgency, suspending the regular question hour sessions, on 21 November 2007 after two days of complete suspension of the proceedings owing to the heated debates between CPI(M) and opposition party members in both the houses. CPI(M) was alienated in the issue by all the other ruling [[United Progressive Alliance]] allies considering the fierce nationwide sentiments against the massacre

== 2008 violence ==

In May 2008, fresh violence broke out in Nandigram between supporters of the [[Bhumi Uchhed Pratirodh Committee]], and the CPM activists. Both sides exchanged fire and hurled bombs at each other, with CPM getting the worst of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Fresh_violence_in_Nandigram_two_injured/articleshow/3011335.cms Fresh violence in Nandigram, two injured].

Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Priyaranjan Dasmunsi and a section of intellectuals including [[Aparna Sen]] from Kolkata, in separate press statements, demanded that panchayat polls, due on 11 May, in the areas falling within the jurisdiction of the Nandigram thana be deferred, for, elections might not be "peaceful and democratic".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/05/07/stories/2008050755391300.htm Fresh attempt to cut off Nandigram].[[The Hindu]]. 7 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral aftermath==

===Panchayat===
The electorate of Nandigram reacted against the Left Front government's policy of industrialisation through farmland acquisition. For the first time since the Left Front government came to power, the opposition wrested control of the [[East Midnapore]] [[District Councils of India|Zilla Parishad]] by winning 35 out of 53 seats on 11 May 2008.

Parishad seats. The results of the election are:
* [[All India Trinamool Congress]]-35,
* [[Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist)]] (SUCI)-1,
* [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] (CPI(M))-14,
* [[Communist Party of India]] (CPI)-2 and
* [[Democratic Socialist Party (Prabodh Chandra)]] (DSP)-1.

In all four seats of Nandigram – I and II blocks, which saw violence after protests against the government's bid for land acquisition for a chemical hub, the Trinamul candidates have won the polls by defeating the CPI(M) candidates including a heavyweight leader. Sheikh Sufian, a [[Bhumi Uchhed Pratirodh Committee]] leader backed by the Trinamul, defeated his rival CPI(M) candidate Ashok Jana by a margin of over 13,000 votes while Pijush Bhunia, another Trinamul leader defeated Ashok Bera, a CPI(M) zonal committee secretary by over 2,100 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestatesman.net/page.arcview.php?clid=1&amp;id=231689&amp;usrsess=1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705213419/http://www.thestatesman.net/page.arcview.php?clid=1&amp;id=231689&amp;usrsess=1 |date=5 July 2009 }}.

===West Bengal election===
In the [[West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, 2011]] the incumbent Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee lost his seat and the Left Front lost power after 34 years.

'''Networked individualism''' represents the shift of the classical model of social arrangements formed around hierarchical bureaucracies or social groups that are tightly-knit, like households and work groups, to connected ''individuals'', using the means provided by the evolution of [[Information and communications technology]]. Although the turn to networked individualism started before the advent of the internet, it has been fostered by the development of social media networks.

==Origin of the term==
The term was coined by Barry Wellman in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;Barry Wellman, “Living Wired in a Networked World: The Rise of Networked Individualism.” Founding conference, Association of Internet Researchers, Lawrence, KS, Sept 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and first published by Manuel Castells and Barry Wellman in 2001.&lt;ref name="castells"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Manuel|first=Castells|date=2001|year=2001|title=The Internet Galaxy: Reflections on the Internet, Business and Society|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Internet-Galaxy-Reflections-Clarendon-Management/dp/0199255776|journal=Oxford University Press|volume=|issue=|pages=132|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Wellman, “Physical Place and Cyber Place: The Rise of Networked Individualism.” ''International Journal of Urban and Regional Research'' 25,2 (June, 2001): 227-52.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was elaborated on by Lee Rainie and [[Barry Wellman]] in their 2012 book ''Networked: The New Social Operating System'' (MIT Press).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Networked: The New Social Operating System|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bYJGna0AhdAC|publisher = MIT Press|date = 2012-04-27|isbn = 9780262300407|first = Lee|last = Rainie|first2 = Barry|last2 = Wellman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The networked individuals are members of diverse groups in which they seek different things; for instance, the same set of individuals could be in a group used to seek emotional support while another group might be used to get good addresses in a city. Those groups can be dispersed around the globe, and the combination of those networks make for a highly individualized, and well-networked, person.&lt;ref name="castells"/&gt;

This new world of networked individualism is oriented around looser, more fragmented networks that provide on-demand succor. Such networks had already formed before the coming of the internet.  In incorporating the internet and mobile phones into their lives, people have changed the ways they interact with each other. They have become increasingly networked as individuals, rather than embedded in groups. In the world of networked individuals, it is the person who is the focus; more than the family, the work unit, the neighborhood, and the social group.&lt;ref name="pewinternet"&gt;{{cite web|author=Rainie, Lee and Wellman, Barry|title=Networked individualism: What in the world is that?|url=http://networked.pewinternet.org/2012/05/24/networked-individualism-what-in-the-world-is-that-2/|publisher=pewinternet.org|accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for the future of society==
Social relationships are changing, and technology is a driving force in many of these changes. There are some fears that the digital technologies are killing society, but studies by the [http://pewinternet.org/ Pew Internet Project] show that these technologies are not isolated — or isolating — systems. They are being incorporated into people’s social lives much like their predecessors were.&lt;ref name="pewinternet"/&gt;

Barry Wellman questioned the future of networked individualism after the event of the [[September 11 attacks]] in his short essay,''The Rise (and Possible Fall) of Networked Individualism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wellman, Barry|title=''The Rise (and Possible Fall) of Networked Individualism''|url=http://www.insna.org/PDF/Connections/v24/2001_I-3-4.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Insna.org|accessdate=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What ''type'' of thing is artificial intelligence? ==

* A form of [[intelligence]]
** [[Synthetic intelligence]] – intelligence of a man-made yet real quality: actual, not fake, not simulated
* A type of [[technology]]
** A type of [[computer technology]]
*** A computer system that performs some intellectual function
** An [[emerging technology]]
* A field:
** An [[academic discipline]]
** A branch of [[science]]
*** A branch of [[applied science]]
**** A branch of [[computer science]]

==Types of artificial intelligence==
* [[Weak AI]] (narrow AI) – non-sentient machine intelligence, typically focused on a narrow task (narrow AI).
* [[Artificial general intelligence|Strong AI / artificial general intelligence]] (AGI) – (hypothetical) machine with the ability to apply intelligence to any problem, rather than just one specific problem, typically meaning "at least as smart as a typical human". It's future potential creation is referred to as a [[technological singularity]], and constitutes a [[global catastrophic risk]] (''see Superintelligence, below'').
* [[Superintelligence]] – (hypothetical) artificial intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds. Due to [[recursive self-improvement]], superintelligence is expected to be a rapid outcome of creating artificial general intelligence.

* [[AI effect]] – as soon as AI successfully solves a problem, the problem is no longer considered by the public to be a part of AI. This phenomenon has occurred in relation to every AI application produced, so far, throughout the history of development of AI.

* [[GOFAI]]
* [[History of machine learning]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Timeline of machine learning|timeline]])
* [[History of machine translation]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Timeline of machine translation|timeline]])
* [[Moore's Law]] – observation that, over the history of computing hardware, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit has doubled approximately every two years. One way this relates to AI is that hypothetically a computer would need at least as much capacity as a human brain to be able to be programmed to be as smart as a human.  So as long as the aforementioned rate of development met or beat the 2-year doubling time, one could roughly forecast when a computer would have as much memory and calculation capacity as a human brain, a milestone which was reached in 2010. Though it may take as much as 3 magnitudes (1000 times) more computer capacity (since computers calculate things in a much more linear fashion) to emulate the massively parallel structure of the human brain. At a doubling time of 2 years, an increase in capacity by 1000-fold would take a little less than 18 years (9 doublings), if reaching the limit of integrated circuit technology did not pose an obstacle before then.

== AI hazards and safety ==
* [[Existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence]] 
** [[Artificial intelligence as a global catastrophic risk]]
** [[AI takeover]] – point at which humans are no longer the dominant form of intelligence on Earth and machine intelligence is
** [[Intelligence explosion]] – through recursive self-improvement and self-replication, the magnitude of intelligent machinery could achieve superintelligence, surpassing human ability to resist it.
** [[Superintelligence]] – AI may grow to such an advanced state to become as proportionately superior to humans as humans are to ants.  Theoretically, there would be little humans could do to prevent such an intelligence from reaching its goals.
** [[Ethics of artificial intelligence#Weaponization of artificial intelligence|Weaponization of artificial intelligence]]
*** [[Artificial intelligence arms race]] &amp;ndash; competition between two or more states to have its military forces equipped with the best "artificial intelligence" (AI).
*** [[Lethal autonomous weapon]]
*** [[Military robot]]
*** [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle]]
* [[Friendly AI]] – hypothetical AI that is designed not to harm humans and to prevent unfriendly AI from being developed

== AI and the future ==
* [[Artificial general intelligence]] (Strong AI) – hypothetical artificial intelligence that matches or exceeds human intelligence — an intelligent machine that could perform intellectual tasks at least as well as a human
** Aspects or features
*** [[Self-replicating machine]]s – smart computers and robots would be able to make more of themselves, in a geometric progression or via mass production.  Or smart programs may be uploaded into hardware existing at the time (because linear architecture of sufficient speeds could be used to emulate massively parallel analog systems such as human brains).
*** [[Recursive self improvement]] (aka seed AI) – speculative ability of strong artificial intelligence to reprogram itself to make itself even more intelligent. The more intelligent it got, the more capable it would be of further improving itself, in successively more rapid iterations, potentially resulting in an intelligence explosion leading to the emergence of a superintelligence.
*** [[Group mind (science fiction)|Hive mind]] –
*** [[Swarm intelligence#In popular culture|Robot swarm]] –
** [[Technological singularity]] – the development of strong AI may cause an intelligence explosion in which greater-than-human intelligence emerges, radically changing civilization, and perhaps even human nature. The TS has been identified by {{Harvtxt|Berglas|2012}} and others to be an existential risk.
*** [[Singularitarianism]] –
*** [[Human enhancement]] – humans may be enhanced, either by the efforts of AI or by merging with it.
**** [[Transhumanism]] – philosophy of human transformation
**** [[Posthumanism]] – people may survive, but not be recognizable in comparison to present modern-day humans.
***** [[Cyborg]]s –

The '''Pearl High School shooting''' was as a [[school shooting]] that occurred on October 1, 1997 at [[Pearl High School (Mississippi)|Pearl High School]] in [[Pearl, Mississippi]], a suburb of [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]].  The gunman, 16-year-old Luke Woodham (born February 5, 1981), killed two students and injured seven others at the school after killing his mother at her home earlier that morning.

==Details==
The incident began on the morning of Wednesday, October 1, 1997, when Luke Woodham fatally stabbed and bludgeoned his mother, Mary Ann Woodham, as she prepared for a morning jog.  At his trial, Woodham claimed that he could not remember killing his mother. Mary Ann Woodham died 20 minutes later from blood loss.

Woodham then drove his mother's [[Toyota Tercel]] to Pearl High School.  Wearing a trench coat to conceal the rifle he was carrying, Woodham entered the school and fatally shot Lydia Kaye Dew and Christina Menefee, his former girlfriend, then went on to wound seven others.&lt;ref name="people"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2012/dec/18/miss-schools-eye-security-after-conn-shooting/ Miss.

The school's assistant principal, Joel Myrick, retrieved a .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol from his truck and, spotting Woodham attempting to flee the parking lot after the shooting, shouted for him to stop. Realizing what Woodham was doing, another student used his own vehicle to block Woodham's path, at which point Woodham attempted to get around the obstruction by driving his mother's car onto a grass verge, only to end up getting stuck in the grass. Seizing his opportunity, Myrick ordered Woodham out of the car at gunpoint and detained him until police arrived at the scene.&lt;ref name="people"/&gt;

Minutes before he started the shooting, Woodham had given the following message to his friend Justin Sledge:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Ames| first=Mark| url=http://www.alternet.org/story/50758/?page=entire | title=Virginia Tech: Is the Scene of the Crime the Cause of the Crime?| publisher=AlterNet| date=April 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|I am not insane, I am angry. I killed because people like me are mistreated every day. I did this to show society, push us and we will push back. ... All throughout my life, I was ridiculed, always beaten, always hated. Can you, society, truly blame me for what I do? Yes, you will. ... It was not a cry for attention, it was not a cry for help. It was a scream in sheer agony saying that if you can't pry your eyes open, if I can't do it through [[pacifism]], if I can't show you through the displaying of intelligence, then I will do it with a bullet.}}

During the subsequent investigation, Woodham's journal was examined by police. In it, he detailed how he and a friend had tortured his dog Sparkle to death, several months prior to the shooting:&lt;ref name="ny001"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/thresholds-of-violence| title=Thresholds of Violence| last=Gladwell| first=Malcolm| date=12 October 2015| work=The New Yorker| accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|I will never forget the howl she made. It sounded almost human. We laughed and hit her hard.}}

==Religious involvement==
On October 8, 1997, Grant Boyette, Delbert Shaw, Donald Brooks, Wesley Brownell, Daniel Thompson and Justin Sledge were arrested in suspicion of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiring]] with Woodham to commit the shooting. During his trial, Woodham claimed to have gotten ideas of committing the murders by being involved with a [[Satan]]ic cult. Woodham admitted to being a [[Satanist]], and claimed that his friend Grant Boyette invited Woodham to join a Satanic group known as "The Kroth." He claimed that Boyette told him that he had "potential to do something great." Woodham said that Boyette promised him that he could get his ex-girlfriend back through [[black magic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9806/11/school.shooting.03/index.html| title=Woodham testifies he was involved in satanism| publisher=[[CNN]]| date=June 11, 1998| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614164953/http://www.cnn.com/US/9806/11/school.shooting.03/index.html| archivedate=June 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his conviction Woodham converted to [[Christianity]], and said the following in a letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://davidwilkersontoday.blogspot.com/2009/05/may-god-give-you-peace-and-rest-in-your.html| title=David Wilkerson Today Blog| publisher=[[David Wilkerson]]| date=May 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; written to [[evangelical]] minister [[David Wilkerson]]:
{{quotation|David, I receive your sermons through the mail. I am one of the school shooters. I'm the one they blame for starting it all off. On October 1, 1997, I went into Pearl High School and killed two students and wounded seven. I also killed my mother before this. After I came to jail I got saved. If there is any way that I can help your ministry, I would love to. Maybe I could give you my testimony. I’ll do anything to help. I look forward to your sermons each month…}}

==Trials and incarceration==
[[File:ParchmanGateNewPhoto.JPG|thumb|[[Mississippi State Penitentiary]], where Luke Woodham is incarcerated]]
There were separate trials for the murder of Woodham's mother and the school shooting. Woodham's lawyer argued at both trials that Woodham was insane at the time of the killings. Jurors rejected Woodham's [[insanity defense]] at his first trial for the murder of his mother, and he was sentenced to [[life in prison]] on June 5, 1998. His second trial took place on June 12, and he was found guilty of two counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder, with the jurors once again rejecting the insanity defense. He was given two life sentences for the murders and seven 20-year sentences for his attempted murder convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9806/12/school.shooting.verdict/| title=Teen guilty in Mississippi school-shooting rampage| publisher=[[CNN]]| date = June 12, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently serving three life terms plus an additional 140 years in prison. He will be eligible for parole in 2046, when he is 65 years old.

[[Conspiracy (crime)|Conspiracy]] charges were filed against Delbert Shaw, Donald Brooks, Wesley Brownell, Daniel Thompson, Grant Boyette and Justin Sledge, accusing them of taking part in a conspiracy to assist Woodham in the murders; however, the charges against Shaw, Brooks, and Brownell were dropped by Judge Robert Goza "at the request of District Attorney John Kitchens, who said Mississippi's conspiracy law would make proving the accusations difficult."&lt;ref name="NYTdropped"/&gt; The case of Daniel Thompson was transferred to youth court because he was 15 years old at the time.&lt;ref name="NYTdropped"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/23/us/conspiracy-charges-are-dropped-in-mississippi-school-shootings.html?scp=7&amp;sq=Justin%20Sledge&amp;st=cse The New York Times: Conspiracy Charges Are Dropped in Mississippi School Shootings]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perinatal mortality''' (PNM), also '''perinatal death''', refers to the death of a [[fetus]] or [[neonate]] and is the basis to calculate the '''perinatal [[mortality rate]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpc.unc.edu/measure/prh/rh_indicators/specific/nb/perinatal-mortality-rate-pmr|title=Perinatal mortality rate (PMR) — MEASURE Evaluation|website=www.cpc.unc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations in the precise definition of the perinatal mortality exist, specifically concerning the issue of inclusion or exclusion of early fetal and late neonatal fatalities. The [[WHO|World Health Organization]] defines perinatal mortality as the "number of stillbirths and deaths in the first week of life per 1,000 total births, the perinatal period commences at 22 completed weeks (154 days) of gestation, and ends seven completed days after birth",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/topics/maternal/maternal_perinatal/en/|title=WHO - Maternal and perinatal health|website=www.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other definitions have been used.&lt;ref name="pmid9431331"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Richardus JH, Graafmans WC, Verloove-Vanhorick SP, Mackenbach JP |title=The perinatal mortality rate as an indicator of quality of care in international comparisons |journal=[[Medical Care (journal)|Medical Care]] |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=54–66 |date=January 1998 |pmid=9431331 |doi= 10.1097/00005650-199801000-00007|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK figure is about 8 per 1,000 and varies markedly by social class with the highest rates seen in Asian women. Globally, an estimated 2.6 million neonates died in 2013 before the first month of age down from 4.5 million in 1990.&lt;ref name=GBD204&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
{{Further information|Preterm birth#Specific risks for the preterm neonate}}
[[Preterm birth]] is the most common cause of perinatal mortality, causing almost 30 percent of neonatal deaths.&lt;ref name=marchofdimes&gt;[http://www.marchofdimes.org/loss/neonatal-death.aspx March of Dimes --&gt; Neonatal Death] Retrieved on November 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome]], in turn, is the leading cause of death in preterm infants, affecting about 1% of newborn infants.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez RJ, Martin RJ, and Fanaroff, AA. ''Respiratory distress syndrome and its management.'' Fanaroff and Martin (eds.) Neonatal-perinatal medicine: Diseases of the fetus and infant; 7th ed. (2002):1001-1011. St. Louis: Mosby.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birth defect]]s cause about 21 percent of neonatal death.&lt;ref name=marchofdimes/&gt;

==Fetal mortality==
Fetal mortality refers to [[stillbirth]]s or fetal death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/fetal_death.htm|title=NVSS - Fetal Deaths|date=8 November 2017|website=www.cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; It encompasses any death of a fetus after 20 weeks of gestation or 500 gm. In some definitions of the PNM '''early fetal mortality''' (week 20-27 gestation) is not included, and the PNM may only include '''late fetal death''' and neonatal death. Fetal death can also be divided into death prior to [[Childbirth|labor]], '''antenatal (antepartum) death''', and death during labor, '''intranatal (intrapartum) death.'''

==Neonatal mortality==
'''Neonatal mortality''' refers to death of a live-born baby within the first 28 days of life. '''Early neonatal mortality''' refers to the death of a live-born [[baby]] within the first seven days of life, while '''late neonatal mortality''' refers to death after 7 days until before 28 days. Some definitions of the PNM include only the early neonatal mortality. Neonatal mortality is affected by the quality of in-hospital care for the [[neonate]]. Neonatal mortality and postneonatal mortality (covering the remaining 11 months of the first year of life) are reflected in the '''[[Infant mortality|Infant Mortality Rate]]'''.

|}

The PNMR refers to the number of perinatal deaths per 1,000 total births. It is usually reported on an annual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.checkpregnancy.com/miscarriage-statistics/|title=Miscarriage Risk by Week and What Affects Your Risks of Miscarriage|date=23 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a major marker to assess the quality of health care delivery. Comparisons between different rates may be hampered by varying definitions, registration bias, and differences in the underlying risks of the populations.

PNMRs vary widely and may be below 10 for certain developed countries and more than 10 times higher in developing countries [http://www.cih.uib.no/journals/EJHD/ejhdv14-n3/ejhd-14-3-page-335.htm]. The WHO has not published contemporary data.

'''Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales''' (7 January 1796&amp;nbsp;– 6 November 1817) was the only child of the British king [[George IV]], who was still [[Prince of Wales]] during her lifetime, and [[Caroline of Brunswick]]. If she had outlived both her grandfather [[King George III]] and her father, she would have become [[Queen of the United Kingdom]], but she died following childbirth at the age of 21, predeceasing them both.

Charlotte's parents disliked each other from before their arranged marriage and soon separated. The Prince of Wales left most of Charlotte's care to governesses and servants, but only allowed her limited contact with Caroline, who eventually left the country. As Charlotte grew to adulthood, her father pressured her to marry [[William II of the Netherlands|William, Hereditary Prince of Orange]] (later King of the Netherlands), but after initially accepting him, Charlotte soon broke off the intended match.  This resulted in an extended contest of wills between her and her father, and finally the Prince of Wales permitted her to marry [[Leopold I of Belgium|Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] (later King of the Belgians).  After a year and a half of happy marriage, Charlotte died after delivering a stillborn son.

Charlotte's death set off tremendous mourning among the British, who had seen her as a sign of hope and a contrast both to her unpopular father and to her grandfather, whom they deemed mad.  As she had been King George III's only legitimate grandchild, there was considerable pressure on the King's unmarried sons to find wives.  King George III's fourth son, [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]], fathered the eventual heir, [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]], who was born 18 months after Charlotte's death.

== Birth ==
[[File:Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales (1796 – 1817),1806.jpg|thumb|upright|Charlotte as a young girl]]
In 1794, [[George IV|George, Prince of Wales]], sought a suitable bride.  He did not do so out of any particular desire to secure the succession, but because he was promised an increased income if he married.{{sfn|Chambers|p=6}} His choice fell on his cousin [[Caroline of Brunswick]], although he had never met her.{{sfn|Chambers|pp=8–9}} George and Caroline were repelled by one another when they first met, but the marriage went ahead on 8 April 1795.{{sfn|Chambers|pp=13–14}} George later stated that the couple had sex only three times;{{sfn|Williams|p=24}} they separated within weeks, though they remained under the same roof.{{sfn|Chambers|pp=15–16}}

On 7 January 1796, one day short of nine months after the wedding,{{sfn|Chambers|pp=15–16}} Caroline gave birth to a daughter at their residence, [[Carlton House, London]]. While George was mildly unhappy that she was not a boy, the King, who preferred girl babies, was delighted at the birth of his first legitimate grandchild, and hoped that the birth would serve to reconcile George and Caroline.{{sfn|Williams|p=26}}  This did not come to pass; three days after the birth, George made a will directing that his wife have no role in the upbringing of their child, and bequeathed all his worldly goods to his mistress, [[Maria Fitzherbert]], while Caroline was left one shilling. Many members of the royal family were unpopular; however, the nation celebrated the princess's birth.{{sfn|Williams|p=27}}  On 11 February 1796, she was christened Charlotte Augusta, after her grandmothers, Queen Charlotte and [[Princess Augusta of Great Britain|Augusta, Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg]],{{sfn|Williams|p=28}} in the Great Drawing Room at Carlton House by [[John Moore (archbishop of Canterbury)|John Moore]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Her godparents were the King, the Queen and the Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg (for whom the [[Charlotte, Princess Royal|Princess Royal]] stood proxy).{{sfn|''London Gazette''|16 February 1796}}

Despite Caroline's demands for better treatment now that she had given birth to the second-in-line to the throne, George restricted her contact with the child, forbidding her to see their daughter except in the presence of a nurse and governess.{{sfn|Williams|p=28}}  Caroline was allowed the usual daily visit which upper class parents paid to their young offspring at this time; she was not allowed any say in the decisions made about Charlotte's care.{{sfn|Plowden|pp=32–33}}  Sympathetic household staff disobeyed the Prince and allowed Caroline to be alone with her daughter.  George was unaware of this, having little contact with Charlotte himself.  Caroline was even bold enough to ride through the streets of London in a carriage with her daughter, to the applause of the crowds.{{sfn|Williams|p=28}}

== Childhood ==
[[File:Princess Charlotte of Wales and Duchess Caroline of Brunswick.jpg|left|thumb|Caroline playing the harp for Charlotte in 1800. Caroline was later [[Delicate Investigation|accused]] of having an affair with the artist [[Sir Thomas Lawrence]] while he was painting the portrait.]]
Charlotte was a healthy child, and according to her biographer, [[Thea Holme]], "The impression one gets from all the early recorded stories of Charlotte is of a happy recklessness, and a warm heart."{{sfn|Holme|p=45}}  As Charlotte grew, her parents continued to battle, and to use the young girl as a pawn in their conflict, with both parents appealing to the King and Queen to take their side.{{sfn|Williams|pp=28–29}}  In August 1797, Caroline left Carlton House, establishing herself in a rented home near [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] and leaving her daughter behind—English law at the time considered the father's rights to minor children paramount.  However, the Prince took no action to further restrict Caroline's access to her daughter.{{sfn|Plowden|pp=43–44}}  In December 1798, the Prince invited his estranged wife to spend the winter at Carlton House, which she refused to do.  It was the last serious effort at reconciliation, and its failure meant there was little likelihood that George would have a legitimate son who would come between Charlotte and the British throne.{{sfn|Holme|pp=46–47}}  Caroline visited her daughter at Carlton House, and sometimes Charlotte was driven out to Blackheath to visit her mother, but was never allowed to stay in her mother's house.{{sfn|Chambers|p=16}}  During the summers, the Prince leased Shrewsbury Lodge at Blackheath for his daughter, which made visiting easier, and according to [[Alison Plowden]], who wrote of George's relationship with his wife and daughter, Caroline probably saw as much of her daughter as she wanted to.{{sfn|Plowden|p=47}}

When Charlotte was eight, her father, whose affections had returned to Fitzherbert, decided that he wanted Carlton House to himself.  He took over his wife's apartments (Caroline received space in [[Kensington Palace]] instead), and moved their daughter into Montague House, adjacent to Carlton House.  As James Chambers, another Charlotte biographer, put it, the young Princess "lived in a household of her own, in the company of no one who was not paid to be there".{{sfn|Chambers|p=16}}  The move took place without the presence of Charlotte's governess, [[Martha Bruce, Countess of Elgin and Kincardine|Lady Elgin]], with whom she was very close.  Lady Elgin had been forced to retire, ostensibly on account of age, but most likely because George was angry that Lady Elgin had taken Charlotte to see the King without George's permission.{{sfn|Chambers|p=17}}  George also dismissed the sub-governess, Miss Hayman, for being too friendly with Caroline—and the Princess of Wales promptly hired her.  Lady Elgin's replacement, [[Edward Southwell, 20th Baron de Clifford|Lady de Clifford]], was fond of Charlotte, and too good natured to discipline the child, who had grown into an exuberant tomboy.  Lady de Clifford brought one of her grandsons, [[George Keppel, 6th Earl of Albemarle|the Honourable George Keppel]], three years younger than Charlotte, as a playmate for her.  Forty years later, Keppel, by then [[Earl of Albemarle]], would remember Charlotte in his memoirs, the source of many of the anecdotes of Charlotte as a small girl.  In addition to tomboy tales of horses and fisticuffs, he remembered them seeing a crowd gathered outside the Keppel house at [[Earl's Court]], who were hoping to see the young Princess.  The two children went outside and joined the crowd, unrecognised.{{sfn|Chambers|pp=18–19}}

In 1805, the King began making plans for Charlotte's education, and engaged a large staff of instructors for his only legitimate grandchild, with [[John Fisher (Anglican bishop)|the Bishop of Exeter]] to instruct her in [[Church of England|the faith]] that King George believed one day Charlotte, as queen, would [[Fidei defensor|defend]].  The King hoped that these teachers would "render her an honour and comfort to her relations, and a blessing to the dominions over which she may hereafter preside".{{sfn|Holme|p=53}}  According to Holme, this instruction made little impression on Charlotte, who chose to learn only what she wanted to learn.{{sfn|Holme|p=53}}  Taught by composer [[Jane Mary Guest]],{{sfn|Raessler|p=133}} Charlotte became an accomplished pianist.{{sfn|Holme|p=69}}

Princess Caroline's unconventional behaviour led, in 1807, to accusations that she had had sexual relations with other men since the separation.  Caroline was caring for a young child, William Austin, who was alleged to be her child by another man.  The Prince of Wales hoped that what was termed "[[the Delicate Investigation]]" would turn up evidence of adultery that would permit him to get a divorce, and forbade Charlotte to see her mother.{{sfn|Holme|pp=62–63}} Charlotte was aware of the investigation.  The ten-year-old was deeply hurt when mother and daughter caught sight of each other in the park, and Caroline, obedient to the Prince's command to have no contact with Charlotte, pretended not to see her.{{sfn|Williams|p=42}}  To George's bitter disappointment, the investigating committee found no evidence Caroline had had a second child, though it noted that the Princess's behaviour was very much open to misconstruction.  The King, who was fond of Caroline, had refused to see her during the investigation, but began to receive her again afterwards.{{sfn|Chambers|pp=26–29}}  After the conclusion of the Delicate Investigation, the Prince reluctantly allowed Charlotte to see her mother again, with the condition that William Austin not be a playmate.{{sfn|Plowden|p=86}}

== Adolescence ==
[[File:Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales 1807.jpg|thumb|Charlotte in 1807, aged 11]]
As Charlotte entered her teenage years, members of the Court considered her behaviour undignified.{{sfn|Williams|p=50}}  Lady de Clifford complained about Charlotte's allowing her [[pantalettes|ankle-length underdrawers]] to show.{{sfn|Holme|p=68}}  Lady [[Charlotte Bury]], a lady-in-waiting to Caroline and a diarist whose writings have survived, described the Princess as a "fine piece of flesh and blood" who had a candid manner and rarely chose to "put on dignity".{{sfn|Plowden|p=88}}  Her father was proud of her horsemanship.{{sfn|Holme|p=68}}  She was fond of music by [[Mozart]] and [[Haydn]], and she identified with the character of Marianne in ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]''.{{sfn|Holme|p=69}} In 1808, [[Charlotte Jones (painter)|Charlotte Jones]] was appointed as Charlotte's own official miniature portrait painter.

In late 1810, King George III began his final descent into madness.  Charlotte and the King were very fond of each other, and the young Princess was greatly saddened by his illness.  On 6 February 1811, Charlotte's father was sworn in as Prince Regent before the [[Privy Council]],{{sfn|Holme|p=72}} as Charlotte rode back and forth in the gardens outside Carlton House, trying to catch glimpses of the ceremony through the ground-floor windows.{{sfn|Plowden|pp=94–95}}  Charlotte was an enthusiastic [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]], as her father had been.  However, now that he was exercising the powers of the monarchy, he did not recall the Whigs to office as many had expected him to do. Charlotte was outraged by what she saw as her father's treason, and, at the opera, demonstrated her support by blowing kisses in the direction of the Whig leader, [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]].{{sfn|Chambers|pp=43–45}}

George had been raised under strict conditions, which he had rebelled against.  Despite this, he attempted to put his daughter, who had the appearance of a grown woman at age 15, under even stricter conditions.  He gave her a clothing allowance insufficient for an adult princess, and insisted that if she attended the opera, she was to sit in the rear of the box and leave before the end.{{sfn|Williams|p=51}}  With the Prince Regent busy with affairs of state, Charlotte was required to spend most of her time at Windsor with her maiden aunts.  Bored, she soon became infatuated with her first cousin, [[George FitzClarence, 1st Earl of Munster|George FitzClarence]], illegitimate son of the Duke of Clarence.  FitzClarence was, shortly thereafter, called to Brighton to join his regiment, and Charlotte's gaze fell on Lieutenant [[Charles Hesse]] of the [[Light Dragoons]], reputedly the illegitimate son of Charlotte's uncle, [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany]].{{sfn|Plowden|p=102}}  Hesse and Charlotte had a number of clandestine meetings.  Lady de Clifford feared the Prince Regent's rage should they be found out, but Princess Caroline was delighted by her daughter's passion. She did everything that she could to encourage the relationship, even allowing them time alone in a room in her apartments.{{sfn|Williams|pp=60–63}}  These meetings ended when Hesse left to join the British forces in Spain.{{sfn|Chambers|p=47}} Most of the Royal Family, except the Prince Regent, were aware of these meetings, but did nothing to interfere, disapproving of the way George was treating his daughter.{{sfn|Chambers|pp=39–40}}

In 1813, with the tide of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] having turned firmly in Britain's favour, George began to seriously consider the question of Charlotte's marriage.  The Prince Regent and his advisers decided on [[William II of the Netherlands|William, Hereditary Prince of Orange]], son and heir-apparent of [[William I of the Netherlands|Prince William VI of Orange]].  Such a marriage would increase British influence in Northwest Europe. William made a poor impression on Charlotte when she first saw him, at George's birthday party on 12 August, when he became intoxicated, as did the Prince Regent himself and many of the guests.  Although no one in authority had spoken to Charlotte about the proposed marriage, she was quite familiar with the plan through palace whispers.{{sfn|Chambers|pp=68–69}}  Dr. [[Henry Halford]] was detailed to sound out Charlotte about the match; he found her reluctant, feeling that a future British queen should not marry a foreigner.{{sfn|Plowden|pp=130–131}} Believing that his daughter intended to marry [[Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh]], the Prince Regent saw his daughter and verbally abused both her and Gloucester.  According to Charlotte, "He spoke as if he had the ''most improper ideas of my inclinations''.  I see that he is ''compleatly {{sic}} poisoned against me'', and that he will ''never'' come round."{{sfn|Plowden|p=132}}  She wrote to Earl Grey for advice; he suggested she play for time.{{sfn|Holme|pp=122–123}} The matter soon leaked to the papers, which wondered whether Charlotte would marry "the Orange or the Cheese" (a reference to [[Gloucester cheese]]), "Slender Billy" [of Orange] or "Silly Billy".{{sfn|Chambers|p=73}}  The Prince Regent attempted a gentler approach, but failed to convince Charlotte who wrote that "I could not quit this country, as Queen of England ''still less''" and that if they wed, the Prince of Orange would have to "''visit his frogs solo''".{{sfn|Chambers|pp=81–82}}  However, on 12 December, the Prince Regent arranged a meeting between Charlotte and the Prince of Orange at a dinner party, and asked Charlotte for her decision.  She stated that she liked what she had seen so far, which George took as an acceptance, and quickly called in the Prince of Orange to inform him.{{sfn|Plowden|pp=134–135}}

[[File:Charlotte meets Leopold.jpeg|thumb|Artist's impression of the first meeting between Princess Charlotte (left) and Prince Leopold (in front of window, with Grand Duchess [[Catherine Pavlovna of Russia]] and the Russian Prince [[Nikolai Gagarin]])]]

Negotiations over the marriage contract took several months, with Charlotte insisting that she not be required to leave Britain. The diplomats had no desire to see the two thrones united, and so the agreement stated that Britain would go to the couple's oldest son, while the second son would inherit the Netherlands; if there was only one son, the Netherlands would pass to the German branch of the [[House of Orange]].{{sfn|Chambers|pp=82–83}} On 10 June 1814, Charlotte signed the marriage contract.{{sfn|Chambers|p=91}}  Charlotte had become besotted with a Prussian prince whose identity is uncertain; according to [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Charles Greville]], it was [[Prince Augustus of Prussia|Prince Augustus]],{{r|Greville's Diary}} although historian Arthur Aspinall disagreed, thinking that her love interest was the younger [[Prince Frederick of Prussia (1794–1863)|Prince Frederick]].{{sfn|Aspinall|p=xvii}} At a party at the Pulteney Hotel in London, Charlotte met a Lieutenant-General in the Russian cavalry, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]].{{sfn|Williams|pp=88–89}} The Princess invited Leopold to call on her, an invitation he took up, remaining for three quarters of an hour, and writing a letter to the Prince Regent apologising for any indiscretion. This letter impressed George very much, although he did not consider the impoverished Leopold as a possible suitor for his daughter's hand.{{sfn|Holme|pp=196–197}}

The Princess of Wales opposed the match between her daughter and the Prince of Orange, and had great public support:  when Charlotte went out in public, crowds would urge her not to abandon her mother by marrying the Prince of Orange.  Charlotte informed the Prince of Orange that if they wed, her mother would have to be welcome in their home—a condition sure to be unacceptable to the Prince Regent.  When the Prince of Orange would not agree, Charlotte broke off the engagement.{{sfn|Plowden|pp=149–150}}  Her father's response was to order that Charlotte remain at her residence at Warwick House (adjacent to Carlton House) until she could be conveyed to [[Cranbourne Lodge]] at Windsor, where she would be allowed to see no one except the Queen.  When told of this, Charlotte raced out into the street.  A man, seeing her distress from a window, helped the inexperienced Princess find a hackney cab, in which she was conveyed to her mother's house.  Caroline was visiting friends and hastened back to her house, while Charlotte summoned Whig politicians to advise her.  A number of  family members also gathered, including her uncle, the Duke of York—with a warrant in his pocket to secure her return by force if need be.  After lengthy arguments, the Whigs advised her to return to her father's house, which she did the next day.{{sfn|Plowden|pp=156–160}}

== Isolation and courtship ==
[[File:Coat_of_Arms_of_Charlotte_Augusta_of_Wales.svg|thumb|Charlotte's personal coat of arms, 1816]]
The story of Charlotte's flight and return was soon the talk of the town; [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]], a former MP and future Whig [[Lord Chancellor]], reported "All are against the Prince", and the Opposition press made much of the tale of the runaway Princess.{{sfn|Plowden|pp=161–163}}  Despite an emotional reconciliation with his daughter, the Prince Regent soon had her conveyed to Cranbourne Lodge, where her attendants were under orders never to let her out of their sight.  She was able to smuggle a note out to her favourite uncle, [[Prince Augustus, Duke of Sussex]].  The Duke responded by questioning the Tory Prime Minister, [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]], in the [[House of Lords]]. He asked whether Charlotte was free to come and go, whether she was allowed to go to the seaside as doctors had recommended for her in the past, and now that she was eighteen, whether the government planned to give her a separate establishment.  Liverpool evaded the questions,{{sfn|Plowden|pp=161–163}} and the Duke was summoned to Carlton House and castigated by the Prince Regent, who never spoke with his brother again.{{sfn|Chambers|p=120}}

Despite her isolation, Charlotte found life at Cranbourne Lodge surprisingly agreeable, and slowly became reconciled to her situation.{{sfn|Smith|p=163}}  At the end of July 1814, the Prince Regent visited Charlotte in her isolation and informed her that her mother was about to leave England for an extended stay on the Continent.  This upset Charlotte, but she did not feel that anything she might say could change her mother's mind, and was further aggrieved by her mother's casualness in the leavetaking, "for God knows how long, ''or what events'' may occur before we meet again".{{sfn|Plowden|pp=164–165}}  Charlotte would never see her mother again.{{sfn|Holme|p=177}}  In late August, Charlotte was permitted to go to the seaside.  She had asked to go to fashionable [[Brighton]], but the Prince Regent refused, sending her instead to [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]].{{sfn|Williams|p=102}}  As the Princess's coach stopped along the way, large, friendly crowds gathered to see her; according to Holme, "her affectionate welcome shows that already people thought of her as their future Queen".{{sfn|Holme|p=183}}  On arrival in Weymouth, there were illuminations with a centrepiece "Hail Princess Charlotte, Europe's Hope and Britain's Glory".{{sfn|Holme|p=186}}  Charlotte spent time exploring nearby attractions, shopping for smuggled French silks, and from late September taking a course of heated seawater baths.{{sfn|Holme|p=186}}  She was still infatuated with her Prussian, and hoped in vain that he would declare his interest in her to the Prince Regent. If he did not do so, she wrote to a friend, she would "take the next best thing, which was a good tempered man with good sence {{sic}}&amp;nbsp;... that man is the P of S-C" [Prince of Saxe-Coburg, i.e. Leopold].{{sfnm|Aspinall||1p=165|Williams||2p=107}} In mid-December, shortly before leaving Weymouth, she "had a very sudden and great shock" when she received news that her Prussian had formed another attachment.{{sfnm|Aspinall||1p=169|Williams||2p=107}}  In a long talk after Christmas dinner, father and daughter made up their differences.{{sfn|Smith|p=163}}

In the early months of 1815, Charlotte fixed on Leopold (or as she termed him, "the Leo") as a spouse.{{sfn|Chambers|p=138}}  Her father refused to give up hope that Charlotte would agree to marry the Prince of Orange.  However, Charlotte wrote, "''No arguments, no threats, shall ever bend'' me to marry this detested Dutchman."{{sfn|Williams|p=111}}  Faced with the united opposition of the Royal Family, George finally gave in and dropped the idea of marriage to the Prince of Orange, who became engaged to [[Anna Pavlovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna of Russia]] that summer.{{sfn|Plowden|p=176}}  Charlotte contacted Leopold through intermediaries, and found him receptive, but with Napoleon [[Hundred Days|renewing the conflict]] on the Continent, Leopold was with his regiment fighting.{{sfn|Plowden|p=178}}  In July, shortly before returning to Weymouth, Charlotte formally requested her father's permission to marry Leopold.  The Prince Regent replied that with the unsettled political situation on the Continent, he could not consider such a request.{{sfn|Plowden|p=181}}  To Charlotte's frustration, Leopold did not come to Britain after the restoration of peace, even though he was stationed in Paris, which she deemed to be only a short journey from Weymouth or London.{{sfn|Holme|pp=206–207}}

In January 1816, the Prince Regent invited his daughter to the [[Royal Pavilion]] in Brighton, and she pleaded with him to allow the marriage.  On her return to Windsor, she wrote her father, "I no longer hesitate in declaring my partiality in favour of the Prince of Coburg—assuring you that no one will be more steady or consistent in this their present &amp; last engagement than myself."{{sfn|Holme|p=210}}  George gave in and summoned Leopold, who was in Berlin en route to Russia, to Britain.{{sfn|Holme|p=211}}  Leopold arrived in Britain in late February 1816, and went to Brighton to be interviewed by the Prince Regent.  After Charlotte was invited as well, and had dinner with Leopold and her father, she wrote:

{{quote |
I find him charming, and go to bed happier than I have ever done yet in my life&amp;nbsp;... I am certainly a very fortunate creature, &amp; have to bless God.  A Princess never, I believe, set out in life (or married) with such prospects of happiness, real domestic ones like other people.{{sfn|Holme|p=213}}
}}

[[File:Charlotte and Leopold wedding.jpg|thumb|left|1818 engraving of the wedding of Charlotte and Leopold]]
The Prince Regent was impressed by Leopold, and told his daughter that Leopold "had every qualification to make a woman happy".{{sfn|Plowden|p=187|loc="and the P.R. should have been an authority on the subject"}}  Charlotte was sent back to Cranbourne on 2 March, leaving Leopold with the Prince Regent.  On 14 March, an announcement was made in the House of Commons to great acclaim, with both parties relieved to have the drama of the Princess's romances at an end.{{sfn|Plowden|pp=188–189}}  Parliament voted Leopold £50,000 per year, purchased [[Claremont House]] for the couple, and allowed them a generous single payment to set up house.{{sfn|Chambers|p=164}} Fearful of a repetition of the Orange fiasco, George limited Charlotte's contact with Leopold; when Charlotte returned to Brighton, he allowed them to meet only at dinner, and never let them be alone together.{{sfn|Holme|p=215}}

The marriage ceremony was set for 2 May 1816.  On the wedding day, huge crowds filled London; the wedding participants had great difficulties in travelling.  At nine o'clock in the evening in the Crimson Drawing Room at Carlton House, with Leopold dressing for the first time as a British General (the Prince Regent wore the uniform of a Field Marshal), the couple were married.  Charlotte's wedding dress cost over ₤10,000.  The only mishap was during the ceremony, when Charlotte was heard to giggle when the impoverished Leopold promised to endow her with all his worldly goods.{{sfn|Chambers|pp=164–167}}

== Marriage and death ==
[[File:Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales and Leopold I after George Dawe.jpg|thumb|Charlotte Augusta and her husband, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]], by [[George Dawe]]]]

The couple honeymooned at [[Oatlands Palace]], the Duke of York's residence in Surrey.  Neither was well and the house was filled with the Yorks' dogs and the odour of animals.  Nevertheless, the Princess wrote that Leopold was "the perfection of a lover".{{sfn|Holme|p=223}}  Two days after the marriage, they were visited by the Prince Regent at Oatlands; he spent two hours describing the details of military uniforms to Leopold, which according to Charlotte "is a ''great mark'' of the ''most perfect good humour''".{{sfn|Smith|p=164}}  Prince Leopold and his wife returned to London for the social season, and when they attended the theatre, they were invariably treated to wild applause from the audience and the singing of "[[God Save the King]]" from the company. When she was taken ill at [[Royal Opera House|the Opera]], there was great public concern about her condition.  It was announced that she had suffered a miscarriage.{{sfn|Holme|pp=224–225}}  On 24 August 1816, they took up residence for the first time at Claremont.{{sfn|Chambers|p=174}}

Leopold's physician-in-ordinary,{{sfn|Holme|p=227}} [[Christian Friedrich, Baron Stockmar|Christian Stockmar]] (later, as Baron Stockmar, adviser to both [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]),{{sfn|Pakula|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vpfuc37LLEAC&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=baron%20stockmar%20victoria%20albert&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q=baron%20stockmar%20victoria%20albert&amp;f=false 33]}} wrote that in the first six months of the marriage, he had never seen Charlotte wear anything that was not simple and in good taste.  He also noted that she was much more calm and in control of herself than she used to be, and attributed this to Leopold's influence.{{sfn|Holme|p=227}}  Leopold wrote later, "Except when I went out to shoot, we were together always, and we ''could'' be together, we did not tire."{{sfn|Chambers|p=177}}  When Charlotte became too excited, Leopold would say only, ''"Doucement, chérie''" ("Gently, my love").  Charlotte both accepted the correction and began calling her husband "Doucement".{{sfn|Holme|p=228}}

The Coburgs, as they came to be called, spent the Christmas holidays at the Brighton Pavilion with various other royals.  On 7 January, the Prince Regent gave a huge ball there to celebrate Charlotte's 21st&amp;nbsp;birthday, but the Coburgs did not attend, having returned to Claremont and preferring to remain there quietly.  At the end of April 1817, Leopold informed the Prince Regent that Charlotte was again pregnant, and that there was every prospect of the Princess carrying the baby to term.{{sfn|Plowden|p=201}}

[[File:Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales.jpg|thumb|left|An engraving based on Sir Thomas Lawrence's painting of Charlotte, which she sat for in her final days]]

Charlotte's pregnancy was the subject of the most intense public interest.  Betting shops quickly set up book on what sex the child would be.  Economists calculated that the birth of a princess would raise the stock market by 2.5%; the birth of a prince would raise it 6%. Charlotte spent her time quietly, spending much time sitting for a portrait by Sir [[Thomas Lawrence]].{{sfn|Williams|p=133}}   She ate heavily and got little exercise; when her medical team began prenatal care in August 1817, they put her on a strict diet, hoping to reduce the size of the child at birth.  The diet, and occasional [[bloodletting|bleeding]], seemed to weaken Charlotte.  Stockmar was amazed at a treatment he saw as outdated, and declined to join the medical team, believing that, as a foreigner, he would be blamed if anything went wrong.{{sfn|Chambers|pp=188–189}}

Much of Charlotte's day to day care was undertaken by Sir [[Richard Croft (obstetrician)|Richard Croft]].  Croft was not a physician, but an [[wikt:accoucheur|accoucheur]], much in fashion among the well-to-do.{{sfn|Chambers|p=1}} Charlotte was believed to be due to deliver on 19 October, but as October ended, she had shown no signs of giving birth, and drove out as usual with Leopold on Sunday 2 November.{{sfn|Holme|pp=237–238}}  On the evening of 3 November, her contractions began.  Sir Richard encouraged her to exercise, but would not let her eat: late that evening, he sent for the officials who were to witness and attest to the royal birth.  As the fourth of November became the fifth, it became clear that Charlotte might be unable to expel the child, and Croft and Charlotte's personal physician, [[Matthew Baillie]], decided to send for obstetrician [[John Sims (taxonomist)|John Sims]].{{sfn|Williams|pp=134–135}} However, Croft did not allow Sims to see the patient, and forceps were not used.  According to Plowden in her book, they might have saved her and the child, though there was a very high mortality rate when instruments were used in the era before antiseptics.{{sfn|Plowden|p=206}}

At nine o'clock in the evening of 5 November, Charlotte finally gave birth to a large stillborn boy.  Efforts to resuscitate him were in vain, and the noble observers confirmed that it was a handsome boy, resembling the Royal Family.  They were assured that the mother was doing well, and took their leave.  An exhausted Charlotte heard the news calmly, stating it was the will of God.  She took some nourishment after her lengthy fast and seemed to be recovering.{{sfn|Plowden|pp=206–207}}  Leopold, who had remained with his wife throughout, apparently took an opiate and collapsed into bed.{{sfn|Williams|p=136}}

Soon after midnight, Charlotte began vomiting violently and complaining of pains in her stomach.  Sir Richard was called, and was alarmed to find his patient cold to the touch, breathing with difficulty, and bleeding.  He placed hot compresses on her, the accepted treatment at the time for postpartum bleeding, but the blood did not stop.  He called in Stockmar and urged him to bring Leopold.  Stockmar found Leopold difficult to rouse, and went to see the Princess, who grabbed his hand and told him, "They have made me tipsy."  Stockmar left the room, planning to try again to rouse the Prince, but was called back by Charlotte's voice, "Stocky!  Stocky!"  He entered the room to find her dead.{{sfn|Chambers|pp=193–194}}

== Aftermath ==
[[File:The Funeral Ceremony of Her Royal Highness the Princess Charlotte of Wales and Saxe Coburg by James Stephanoff.jpg|thumb|Princess Charlotte's funeral]]
[[File:De Grote Voorkamer -Royal Palace.JPG|thumb|A painting of Charlotte is on display in the [[Royal Palace of Brussels]], Royal Collection of Belgium]]
Henry Brougham wrote of the public reaction to Charlotte's death, "It really was as though every household throughout Great Britain had lost a favourite child."{{sfn|Williams|p=137}}  The whole kingdom went into deep mourning; linen-drapers ran out of black cloth.  Even the poor and homeless tied armbands of black on their clothes.  The shops closed for two weeks, as did the [[Royal Exchange (London)|Royal Exchange]], the Law Courts, and the docks.  Even gambling dens shut down on the day of her funeral, as a mark of respect.{{sfn|Holme|pp=240–241}}  Wrote ''[[The Times]]'', "It certainly does not belong to us to repine at the visitations of Providence&amp;nbsp;... there is nothing impious in grieving for that as a calamity."{{sfn|Plowden|pp=208–209}}  Mourning was so complete that the makers of ribbons and other fancy goods (which could not be worn during the period of mourning) petitioned the government to shorten the period, fearing they would otherwise go bankrupt.{{sfn|Williams|p=137}}  A dissenting note was struck by poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], who in his ''An Address to the People on the Death of the Princess Charlotte'', indicated that the execution of three men the day after the Princess's death for [[Pentrich Rising|plotting to overthrow the government]] was a greater tragedy.{{sfn|Williams|p=240}}

The Prince Regent was prostrated with grief, and was unable to attend his child's funeral.  Princess Caroline heard the news from a passing courier, and fainted in shock.  On recovering, she stated, "England, that great country, has lost everything in losing my ever beloved daughter."{{sfn|Williams|pp=138–139}}  Even the Prince of Orange burst into tears at hearing the news, and his wife ordered the ladies of her court into mourning.{{sfn|Williams|pp=138–139}}  The greatest effect fell on Prince Leopold.  Stockmar wrote years later, "November saw the ruin of this happy home, and the destruction at one blow of every hope and happiness of Prince Leopold.  He has never recovered the feeling of happiness which had blessed his short married life."{{sfn|Holme|p=241}}  According to Holme, "without Charlotte he was incomplete.  It was as if he had lost his heart."{{sfn|Holme|p=241}}

Prince Leopold wrote to Sir Thomas Lawrence:

{{quote |
Two generations gone.  Gone in a moment! I have felt for myself, but I have also felt for the Prince Regent. My Charlotte is gone from the country—it has lost her. She was a good, she was an admirable woman. None could know my Charlotte as I did know her!  It was my study, my duty, to know her character, but it was my delight!{{sfn|Chambers|p=201|loc=some references omit the word "also"}}
}}

The Princess was buried, her son at her feet, in [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], on 19 November 1817.  A monument by the sculptor [[Matthew Cotes Wyatt]] was erected, by public subscription, at her tomb.{{sfn|Chambers|p=201}}  It was not long before the public began to pin blame for the tragedy.  The Queen and the Prince Regent were blamed for not being present at the birth, though Charlotte had specifically requested that they stay away.{{sfn|Chambers|p=201}}  Although the postmortem was inconclusive, many blamed Croft for his care of the Princess.  The Prince Regent refused to blame Croft; nevertheless, three months after Charlotte's death and while attending another young woman, Croft snatched up a gun and fatally shot himself.{{sfn|Williams|p=240}}  The "triple obstetric tragedy"—death of child, mother, and practitioner—led to significant changes in obstetric practice, with obstetricians who favoured intervention in protracted labour, including in particular more liberal use of forceps, gaining ground over those who did not.{{sfn|Gibbs et al.|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=v4krPhqFG8sC&amp;pg=PA471 471]}}

An obelisk in memory of Charlotte was erected by the then [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[member of parliament|MP]] for [[Walsall]], [[Robert Wellbeloved Scott]], in the grounds of his [[country house]] (now [[Red House Park]], in [[Sandwell]]).&lt;ref name="SMBC-FP"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maull |first1=Jayne |title='Forgotten Princess' remembered at Red House Park event |url=http://www.sandwell.gov.uk/news/article/4437/forgotten_princess_remembered_at_red_house_park_event |publisher=Sandwell MBC |accessdate=30 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having become badly damaged through age, it was restored in August 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anon|date=2009-08-28|title=n/a|journal=Great Barr Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; at cost of £15,000.&lt;ref name="RotO"&gt;{{cite web |title=Restoration of the Obelisk |url=http://www.b43.co.uk/red/index.php/projects/restoration-of-the-obelisk |publisher=Friends of Red House Park |accessdate=30 June 2018 |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlotte's death left the King without any legitimate grandchildren; his youngest surviving child was over forty.  The newspapers urged the King's unmarried sons towards matrimony.  One such leading article reached the King's fourth son, [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]], at his home in Brussels, where he was living with his mistress, [[Julie de St Laurent]].  Edward quickly dismissed his mistress and proposed to Leopold's sister [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Victoria, Dowager Princess of Leiningen]].{{sfn|Chambers|pp=202–204}} Their daughter, [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]], became Queen of the United Kingdom in 1837.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1536">'''Quickprop''' is an iterative method for determining the minimum of the [[loss function]] of an [[artificial neural network]], following an algorithm inspired by the [[Newton's method]]. Sometimes, the algorithm is classified to the group  of the second order learning methods. It follows a quadratic approximation of the previous [[gradient]] step and the current gradient, which is expected to be close to the minimum of the loss function, under the assumption that the loss function is locally approximately square, trying to describe it by means of an upwardly open [[parabola]]. The minimum is sought in the vertex of the parabola. The procedure requires only local information of the [[artificial neuron]] to which it is applied.
The k-th approximation step is given by:

&lt;math&gt; \Delta^{(k)} \, w_{ij} = \Delta^{(k-1)} \, w_{ij} \left ( \frac{\nabla_{ij} \, E^{(k)}}{\nabla_{ij} \, E^{(k-1)} - \nabla_{ij} \, E^{(k)}} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Being &lt;math&gt; w_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; the neuron j weight of its i input and E is the loss function.

The Quickprop algorithm is an implementation of the error [[backpropagation]] algorithm, but the network  can behave chaotically during the learning phase due to large step sizes.

'''''Repentance''''' ({{lang-ka|მონანიება|Monanieba}} [[translit.]] ''Monanieba'', {{lang-ru|Покаяние|Pokayaniye}}) is a [[List of Georgian films|Georgian film]] directed by [[Tengiz Abuladze]].  The movie was made in 1984, but its release was banned in the Soviet Union for its semi-allegorical critique of [[Stalinism]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/16/movies/repentance-a-soviet-film-milestone-strongly-denounces-official-evil.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?id=770340%7C715170&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered at the [[1987 Cannes Film Festival]], winning the [[FIPRESCI]] Prize, [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prize of the Jury]], and the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/432/year/1987.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Repentance |accessdate=2009-07-19|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was selected as the Soviet entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[60th Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''Repentance'' is set in a small Georgian town. The film starts with the scene of a woman preparing cakes. A man in a chair is reading from a newspaper that the town's mayor, Varlam Aravidze ([[Avtandil Makharadze]]) has died. One day after the funeral the corpse of the mayor turns up in the garden of his son's house. The corpse is reburied, only to reappear again in the garden. A woman, Ketevan Barateli ([[Zeinab Botsvadze]]), is eventually arrested and accused of digging up the corpse. She defends herself and states that Varlam does not deserve to be buried as he was responsible for a Stalin-like regime of terror responsible for the disappearance of her parents and her friends. She is put on trial and gives her testimony, with the story of Varlam's regime being told in flashbacks.

During the trial, Varlam's son Abel ([[Avtandil Makharadze]]) denies any wrongdoings by his father and his lawyer tries to get Ketevan declared insane. Varlam's grandson Tornike ([[Merab Ninidze]]) is shocked by the revelations about the crimes of his grandfather. He ultimately commits suicide. Abel himself then throws Varlam's corpse off a cliff on the outskirts of the town.

At the end, the film returns to the scene of the woman preparing a cake. An old woman is asking her at the window whether this is the road that leads to the church. The woman replies that the road is Varlam Street and will not lead to the temple. The old woman replies: "What good is a road if it doesn't lead to a church?"

==Cast==
Abuladze cast several of his family members in leading roles in the film.&lt;ref name="christensen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christensen|first=Julie|title=Tengiz Abuladze's Repentance and the Georgian Nationalist Cause|journal=[[Slavic Review]]|volume=50|issue=1|pages=163–175|date=Spring 1991|url=http://medb.byu.edu/files/lesson/BS_Repentancearticle_Lesson7.pdf|doi=10.2307/2500608|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214140224/http://medb.byu.edu/files/lesson/BS_Repentancearticle_Lesson7.pdf|archivedate=2013-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
* [[Khachaturian]], ''[[Sabre Dance]]'': at the end of the audience that Varlam Aravidze grants to Sandro Barateli, who complains to him that the scientific equipment housed by the regime in the old church threatens to destroy it. The audience takes place in what appears to be a hothouse, and the music blares from speakers hidden among the foliage.
* [[Debussy]], ''[[Des pas sur la neige]]'': Sandro Barateli plays ''Des pas sur la neige'' on the piano in his apartment before dawn on the morning of his arrest while Nino sleeps in a chair. The music accompanies Nino's dream of her and her husband fleeing through flooded underground passages and then through the streets of old [[Tbilisi]], pursued by Varlam Aravidze, who rides in the back of an open-topped motorcar.
* [[Beethoven]], ''[[Moonlight Sonata]]'': Abel Aravidze plays the ''Moonlight Sonata'' on the piano in his villa just before the confrontation with his son, Tornike, who then decides to commit suicide. 
* [[Boney M.]], ''[[Sunny (Bobby Hebb song)|Sunny]]'': just before Tornike Aravidze shoots himself with the hunting rifle he received as a present from his grandfather Varlam, some friends of Abel and Guliko Aravidze enter, carrying bottles of champagne, to celebrate the victory in court over Ketevan Barateli, and a radio blaring the song ''Sunny''.
* [[Gounod]], ''Mors et Vita'': the heavenly chorale from the ''Mors et Vita'' oratorio provides the background music to the close of the film, as the little old lady, played by great Georgian actress [[Veriko Anjaparidze]], climbs the hill, up Varlam Aravidze Street, having asked directions from Ketevan Barateli to the church that was blown up by Varlam's regime.

==Production==
Tengiz Abuladze started to think about the film in the early 1970s. A near-fatal car accident in the early 1980s then convinced Abuladze to start shooting the film. He was encouraged by [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] who at that time was the first secretary of the [[Georgian Communist Party]] and who offered a special and uncensored slot on Georgian television for the film. During the shooting of the film the actor [[Gega Kobakhidze]] was arrested for being involved in the hijacking of [[Aeroflot Flight 6833]]. Production was temporarily halted, and was resumed several months later with [[Merab Ninidze]] replacing Kobakhidze.&lt;ref name="christensen" /&gt;

==Release==
When the film was finished in 1984 it was screened once and then shelved for three years. In 1987, with the new political climate initiated by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], the film was released again all over the Soviet Union and at film festivals in Western countries. Abuladze was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]] and he accompanied Gorbachev on his first official visit to New York in 1988.&lt;ref name="christensen" /&gt; In 1988, Soviet authorities again, unofficially, banned the movie for its outstanding controversy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/16/movies/repentance-a-soviet-film-milestone-strongly-denounces-official-evil.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?id=770340%7C715170&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In [[West Germany]], ''Repentance'' was broadcast by [[ZDF]] on 13 October 1987. The broadcast was received and widely seen in [[East Germany]] where the film was banned. East German television viewers reacted strongly as they saw parallels to their own regime. This reaction forced East German authorities and the East German press to react. [[Harald Wessel]], second editor in chief of ''[[Neues Deutschland]]'' and the editor in chief of the ''[[Junge Welt]]'', [[Hans-Dieter Schütt]] published editorials in their newspapers that tried to both denounce the film and to avoid anti-Soviet undertones. The situation was complicated by the fact that the editorials were for a film that was banned and should theoretically be unknown to East German readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kowalczuk|first=Ilko-Sascha|title=Endspiel: die Revolution von 1989 in der DDR|publisher=[[C.H.

'''Sacral nerve stimulation''', also termed sacral [[Neuromodulation (medicine)|neuromodulation]],  is a type of medical [[electrical stimulation]] therapy.

It typically involves the implantation of a programmable stimulator [[subcutaneously]], which delivers low amplitude electrical stimulation via a lead to the [[sacral nerve]], usually accessed via the S3 [[foramen]].

The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] has approved InterStim Therapy, by [[Medtronic]], as a sacral nerve stimulator for treatment of [[urinary incontinence]], high [[urinary frequency]] and [[urinary retention]].  Sacral nerve stimulation is also under investigation as treatment for other conditions, including [[constipation]] brought on by nerve damage due to surgical procedures. An experimental procedure for constipation in children is being conducted in Nationwide Children's Hospital.

In the event that the nerves and the brain are no longer communicating effectively, resulting in a bowel/bladder disorder, this type of treatment is designed to imitate a signal sent via the central nervous system.

One of the major nerve routes is from the brain, along the spinal cord and through the back.  This is commonly referred to as the sacral area.  This area controls the everyday function of the [[pelvic floor]], urethral sphincter, bladder and bowel.  By stimulating the sacral nerve (located in the lower back), a signal is sent that manipulates a contraction within the pelvic floor. Over time these contractions rebuild the strength of the organs and muscles within it.  This effectively alleviates all symptoms of urinary/faecal disorders, and in many cases eliminates them completely.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Medical uses==

===Urge incontinence===
Many studies have been initiated using the sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) technique to treat patients that suffer with urinary problems.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} When applying this procedure, proper patient screening is essential, because some disorders that affect the urinary tract (like [[bladder calculus]] or [[carcinoma in-situ]]) have to be treated differently. Once the patient is selected, he receives a temporary external pulse generator connected to wire leads at S3 [[foramina]] for 1–2 weeks. If the person's symptoms improve by more than 50%, he receives the permanent wire leads and stimulator that is implanted in the [[hip]] in the [[subcutaneous tissue]]. The first follow up happens 1–2 weeks later to check if the permanent devices are providing improvement in the user's symptoms and to program the pulse generator adequately.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Bleeding, infection, pain and unwanted stimulation in the extremities are some of the complications resulting from this therapy. Currently, battery replacements are necessary 5–10 years after implementation depending upon the strength of the stimulation therapy. This procedure has shown long term success rate that ranges from 50% to 90%, and one study concluded that it was a good option for patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction refractive to conservative and pharmacological interventions.&lt;ref&gt;4. {{cite journal|authors=Hubsher C.P., Jansen R., Riggs D.R., Jackson B.J., Zaslau S.|title=Sacral nerve stimulation for neuromodulation of the lower urinary tract|journal=Can J Urol|year=2012|volume=19|issue=5|pages=6480–4|pmid=23040633|url=http://www.canjurol.com/html/free-articles/V19I5-18F_DrHubsher.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fecal incontinence===
[[Fecal incontinence]], the involuntary loss of stool and flatus release afflicting mainly elderly people, can also be treated with sacral nerve stimulation as long as patients have intact [[sphincter muscle]]s.  The FDA approved the approach for treating the fecal incontinence in March 2011. The [[etiology]] is not well understood yet and both conservative treatments (like [[antidiarrheic]]s, special diet and [[biofeedback]]) and surgical treatments for this disorder are not regarded as ideal options.&lt;ref&gt;6. {{cite journal|authors=Hayden DM, Weiss EG.|title=Fecal incontinence: etiology, evaluation, and treatment|journal=Clin Colon Rectal Surg.|year=2011|volume=24|issue=1|pages=64–70|doi=10.1055/s-0031-1272825|pmid=22379407|pmc=3140335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pascual et al. (2011) revised the follow up results of the first 50 people that submit to sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) to treat fecal incontinence in Madri (Spain). The most common cause for the fecal incontinence was obstetric procedures, idiopathic origin and prior anal surgery, and all these people were refractory to the conservative treatment. The procedure consisted of placing a temporary pulse generator connected to a unilateral electrode at S3 or S4 foramen for 2–4 weeks. After it was confirmed that the SNS was decreasing the incontinence episodes, the patients received the definitive electrode and pulse generator that was implanted in the [[gluteus]] or in the [[abdomen]].  Two patients did not show improvement in the first step and did not receive the definitive stimulator. Mean follow up was 17.02 months and during this time the patients showed improvement in the voluntary contraction pressure and reduction of incontinence episodes. Complications were two cases of infection, two cases with pain and one broken electrode. Therefore, although the reason the SNS is effective is unknown, this procedure had satisfactory results in these clinical cases with a low incidence of complications, and the study concluded that it was a good option for treatment of anal incontinence.&lt;ref&gt;7. {{cite journal|authors=Pascual, I., González-Gómez, C.C., Ortega, R., Jiménez-Toscano, M., Marijuán J.L., Lomas-Espadas, M., Fernández-Cebrián, J.M., García-Olmo D., Pascual-Montero, J.M.|title=Sacral Nerve Stimulation for fecal incontinence|journal=Rev Esp Enferm Dig.|year=2011|volume=103|issue=7|pages=355–359|pmid=21770681|url=http://www.grupoaran.com/mrmUpdate/lecturaPDFfromXML.asp?IdArt=4619725&amp;TO=RVN&amp;Eng=1|doi=10.4321/s1130-01082011000700004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chronic anal fissure===
Sacral nerve stimulation offers an effective alternative treatment option for chronic anal fissure in patients who chose not to pursue more invasive surgical interventions. [[Anal fissure]] is a crack in the [[epithelium]] of the [[anus]] that causes anal pain and bleeding during or after defecation. The pathogenesis is not well understood and healthy people of all ages can be affected.

The most common treatment of chronic anal fissure is surgical intervention. It has reached cure to more than 90%, but it has led to fecal incontinence to 17%-30% of the patients. Drugs have been also used for the treatment in attempt to reduce the [[sphincter]] pressure. However, they are not very satisfactory, showing transient action or side effects like headache.

Yakovlev and Karasev (2010) report a case of a woman 20 years old. She was diagnosed with chronic anal fissure and had already used pharmacological treatments which she suffers with headache, incontinence of flatus and the recurrence of the disease. The patient underwent placement of wire leads in the [[sacrum]] between S1 and S4 and received stimulation for two weeks 24 hours a day. She reported having no more pain in the 10th day and she got healed of the anal fissure after these two weeks under electrical stimulation. There was not any related complication and the disease did not come back during the 20 months of follow-up. Also the therapy can be adjusted according to the patient and is completely reversible. In the literature the major complications related to SNS are discomfort and infection (that can afflicted 3%–17% of patients that underwent SNS).&lt;ref&gt;5. {{cite journal|authors=Yakovlev A, Karasev SA|title=Successful treatment of chronic anal fissure utilizing sacral nerve stimulation|journal=WMJ|year=2010|volume=109|issue=5|pages=279–82|pmid=21066934|url=https://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/_WMS/publications/wmj/pdf/109/5/279.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
TENS ([[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]]) was patented and first used in 1974 for pain relief.  TENS is non-invasive; it sends electric current through electrodes placed directly on the skin.  Although predominantly carried out as a percutaneous procedure, it is possible to apply sacral nerve stimulation with the use of these external electrodes. It is not known if TENS helps with chronic pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nnoaham|first=Kelechi E.|last2=Kumbang|first2=Jharna|date=2008-07-16|title=Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for chronic pain|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=3|pages=CD003222|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003222.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=18646088}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently no studies into the efficacy of this on an overactive bladder and other associated symptoms of urinary incontinence, however, in a report carried out by GUT (an international peer-reviewed journal for health professionals and researchers in gastroenterology and hepatology) it was found that 20% of the group tested achieved complete continence.  All others saw a significant reduction in the frequency of FI episodes and an improvement in the ability to defer defecation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Gut|year=2013|volume=62|page=A38|doi=10.1136/gutjnl-2013-304907.087|url=http://gut.bmj.com/content/62/Suppl_1/A38.2|title=OC-088Prospective Pilot Study to Investigate Transcutaneous Sacral Nerve Stimulation for Faecal Incontinence|authors=G Thomas, C Norton, R J Nicholls, C Vaizey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first percutaneous sacral nerve stimulation study was performed in 1988.  By penetrating the skin, sacral nerve stimulation aims to give a direct and localized electric current to specific nerves in order to elicit a favored response.  Today it is one of the most common neuromodulation techniques.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Percutaneous procedure==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}
Patients interested in getting a sacral nerve stimulator implanted in them because less severe methods have failed all must go through a trial for their own safety, known as the PNE (percutaneous nerve evaluation).  PNE involves inserting a temporary electrode to the left or right of the S3 posterior foramen.  This electrode is connected to an external pulse generator, which generates a signal for 3–5 days.  If this neuromodulation has positive results for the patient, the option of implanting a permanent electrode for permanent sacral neuromodulation is possible.

The procedure has low level of [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|invasiveness]], as all incisions are relatively small.  A pulse generator is implanted in a subcutaneous pocket in the upper, outer quadrant of the buttock or even the lower abdomen. The generator is attached to a thin lead wire with a small electrode tip which is anchored near the sacral nerve.

The most common postoperative complaints are pain and lead migration.  In most studies, usually 5-10% of subjects need post-operative correction to lead migration, but since leads can be anchored near the sacral nerve, subsequent operations are generally unnecessary.

==Mechanism==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
Stimulation of the sacral nerve causes contraction of external sphincter and pelvic floor muscle, which in turn causes the inhibition of bladder contractions which may be involuntarily releasing urine. Researchers currently believe that the sacral neuromodulation blocks the c-afferent fibers, which are a critical part of the afferent limb of a pathological reflex arc believed to be responsible for incontinence.

'''Senescence''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɪ|ˈ|n|ɛ|s|ə|n|s}}) or '''biological''' '''aging''' is the gradual deterioration of [[Function (biology)|functional]] characteristics. The word ''senescence'' can refer either to [[cellular senescence]] or to senescence of the whole [[organism]]. Organismal senescence involves an increase in [[mortality rate|death rates]] and/or a decrease in [[fecundity]] with increasing age, at least in the later part of an organism's [[biological life cycle|life cycle]].

Senescence is the inevitable fate of all [[multicellular organism]]s with [[germ cell|germ]]-[[somatic cell|soma]] separation,&lt;ref name="nelson_2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nelson |first1=Paul |last2=Masel |first2=Joanna |title=Intercellular competition and the inevitability of multicellular aging |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=5 December 2017 |volume=114 |issue=49 |pages=12982–12987 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1618854114|pmid=29087299 |pmc=5724245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it can be delayed. The discovery, in 1934, that [[calorie restriction]] can extend lifespan by 50% in rats, and the existence of species having  [[negligible senescence]] and potentially immortal species such as ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'', have motivated research into delaying senescence and thus [[age-related disease]]s. Rare human mutations can cause [[accelerated aging disease]]s.

Environmental factors may affect aging, for example, overexposure to [[ultraviolet radiation]] accelerates [[skin aging]]. Different parts of the body may age at different rates. Two organisms of the same species can also age at different rates, making biological aging and chronological aging distinct concepts.

There are a number of hypotheses as to [[evolution of ageing|why senescence occurs]].

==Definition and characteristics==
[[Image:Ann Pouder.jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|[[Supercentenarian]] [[Ann Pouder]] (8 April 1807 – 10 July 1917) photographed on her 110th birthday. A heavily lined face is common in human senescence.]]
''Organismal senescence'' is the aging of whole organisms. Actuarial senescence can be defined as an increase in mortality and/or a decrease in fecundity with age. The [[Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality]] says that that the age-dependent component of the [[mortality rate]] [[exponential growth|increases exponentially]] with age.

In 2013, a group of scientists defined nine hallmarks of aging that are common between organisms with emphasis on mammals: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of [[proteostasis]], deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication.&lt;ref name="pmid23746838"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2013|title=The hallmarks of aging|url=|journal=Cell|volume=153|issue=6|pages=1194–217|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.039|pmc=3836174|pmid=23746838|access-date=|via=|author=Lopez-Otin, C|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aging]] is characterized by the declining ability to respond to stress, increased [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] imbalance, and increased risk of [[aging-associated diseases]] including [[cancer]] and [[heart disease]]. Aging has been defined as "a progressive deterioration of physiological function, an intrinsic age-related process of loss of viability and increase in vulnerability."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Aging and Gerontology Glossary |url=http://www.senescence.info/glossary.html | accessdate = 26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The environment induces damage at various levels, e.g. [[DNA damage theory of aging|damage to DNA]], and damage to tissues and cells by oxygen [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]] (widely known as [[Free-radical theory|free radicals]]), and some of this damage is not repaired and thus accumulates with time. [[Cloning]] from somatic cells rather than germ cells may begin life with a higher initial load of damage. [[Dolly the sheep]] died young from a contagious lung disease, but data on an entire population of cloned individuals would be necessary to measure mortality rates and quantify aging.

The evolutionary theorist George Williams wrote, "It is remarkable that after a seemingly miraculous feat of [[morphogenesis]], a complex [[metazoa]]n should be unable to perform the much simpler task of merely maintaining what is already formed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = G.C. | year = 1957 | title = Pleiotropy, natural selection, and the evolution of senescence | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 398–411 | doi = 10.2307/2406060 | jstor = 2406060 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variation among species==

Differences rates of aging, i.e. different speeds with which mortality increases with age, correspond to different [[maximum life span]] among [[species]]. For example, a [[mouse]] is elderly at 3 years while a [[human]] is elderly at 80 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Comparative Biology of Aging |year=2009 |author=Austad, S |journal=[[J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci]] |volume=64 |pages=199–201|pmid=19223603|issue=2|doi=10.1093/gerona/gln060|pmc=2655036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all organisms senesce, including [[bacterial senescence|bacteria]] which have asymmetries between "mother" and "daughter" cells upon cell division, with the mother cell experiencing aging, while the daughter is rejuvenated.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Senescence has been so far undetectable in a handful of species ([[negligible senescence]]), such as those in the genus ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]''. [[Planarian]] flatworms have "apparently limitless [[telomere]] regenerative capacity fueled by a population of highly proliferative adult [[stem cells]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thomas C.

==Evolutionary theories of aging==
{{Main|Evolution of ageing}}

===Mutation accumulation===
Natural selection can support lethal and harmful [[allele]]s, if their effects are felt after reproduction. The geneticist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] wondered why the dominant mutation that causes [[Huntington's disease]] remained in the population, and why natural selection had not eliminated it. The onset of this neurological disease is (on average) at age 45 and is invariably fatal within 10–20 years. Haldane assumed that, in human prehistory, few survived until age 45. Since few were alive at older ages and their contribution to the next generation was therefore small relative to the large cohorts of younger age groups, the force of selection against such late-acting deleterious mutations was correspondingly small. Therefore, a [[genetic load]] of late-acting deleterious mutations could be substantial at [[mutation-selection balance]]. This concept came to be known as the [[selection shadow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/the-evolution-of-aging-23651151 |title=The Evolution of Aging |last1=Fabian |first1=Daniel |last2=Flatt |first2=Thomas |date=2011 |website=[[Scitable]] |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |accessdate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Medawar]] formalised this observation in his [[Evolution of ageing#Mutation accumulation|mutation accumulation theory]] of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Medawar PB |year=1946 |title=Old age and natural death |journal=Modern Quarterly |volume=1 |pages=30–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Peter B. | last=Medawar |  year=1952 | title=An Unsolved Problem of Biology |  publisher=H. K. Lewis | location=London}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The force of natural selection weakens with increasing age—even in a theoretically immortal population, provided only that it is exposed to real hazards of mortality. If a genetic disaster... happens late enough in individual life, its consequences may be completely unimportant". The 'real hazards of mortality' such as predation, disease, and accidents, are known '[[extrinsic mortality]]', and mean that even a population with [[negligible senescence]] will have fewer individuals alive in older age groups.

===Antagonistic pleiotropy===
Another evolutionary theory of aging was proposed by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=George C. |last=Williams |date=December 1957 |title=Pleiotropy, Natural Selection, and the Evolution of Senescence |journal=Evolution |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=398–411 |doi=10.2307/2406060 |jstor=2406060 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and involves [[antagonistic pleiotropy]]. A single gene may affect multiple traits. Some traits that increase fitness early in life may also have negative effects later in life. But, because many more individuals are alive at young ages than at old ages, even small positive effects early can be strongly selected for, and large negative effects later may be very weakly selected against. Williams suggested the following example: Perhaps a gene codes for calcium deposition in bones, which promotes juvenile survival and will therefore be favored by natural selection; however, this same gene promotes calcium deposition in the arteries, causing negative atherosclerotic effects in old age. Thus, harmful biological changes in old age may result from selection for [[pleiotropy|pleiotropic]] genes that are beneficial early in life but harmful later on. In this case, selection pressure is relatively high when [[Fisher's reproductive value]] is high and relatively low when Fisher's reproductive value is low.

An example of antagonistic pleiotropy may be the trade-off between investing resources in reproduction, rather than maintenance of the body &amp;ndash; [[Disposable soma theory of aging|the "Disposable Soma" theory]].&lt;ref name="Kirkwood 1977"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kirkwood|first1= T.B.L. |title=Evolution of ageing |journal=Nature |volume=270 |issue=5635 |pages=301–4 |date=November 1977 |pmid=593350 |doi=10.1038/270301a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory states that  resources can be allocated towards somatic maintenance and reproduction, such as in aging being a resource allocation to somatic maintenance rather than reproduction.&lt;ref name="Kirkwood 1977" /&gt;

===Adaptive aging===
Programmed theories of aging posit that aging is adaptive, normally invoking selection for [[evolvability]] or [[group selection]].

The [[reproductive-cell cycle theory]] suggests that aging is regulated by changes in hormonal signaling over the lifespan.&lt;ref name="pmid20851172"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bowen RL |author2=Atwood CS |title=The reproductive-cell cycle theory of aging: an update. |journal=Experimental Gerontology|volume=46|issue=2|pages=100–7|year=2011|pmid=20851172|doi=10.1016/j.exger.2010.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cellular senescence==
{{Main|Cellular senescence}}

(lower) MEFs became senescent after passages. Cells grow larger, flatten shape and expressed senescence-associated [[Beta-galactosidase|β-galactosidase]] (SABG, blue areas), a marker of cellular senescence.]]

[[cell (biology)|Cells]] accumulate damage over time, but this may be counterbalanced by [[natural selection]] to remove damaged cells. In particular [[DNA damage theory of aging|DNA damage]], e.g. due to reactive oxygen species, leads to the accumulation of harmful [[somatic mutation]]s.&lt;ref name="KimuraSuzuki2008"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first1=Honoka |editor-last1=Kimura|editor-first2=Aoi |editor-last2=Suzuki|title=New Research on DNA Damage|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=arjZMwAACAAJ|page=1}}|year=2008|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|last1=Bernstein |first1=H |last2=Payne |first2=CM |last3=Bernstein |first3=C |last4=Garewal |first4=H |last5=Dvorak |first5=K|chapter=Cancer and aging as consequences of un-repaired DNA damage. |pp= 1–47 |chapter-url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=43247 |isbn=978-1604565812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most multicellular species, [[somatic cell]]s eventually experience ''replicative senescence'' and are unable to [[cell division|divide]]. This can prevent highly [[somatic mutation|mutated]] cells from becoming [[cancer]]ous. In culture, fibroblasts can reach a maximum of 50 cell divisions; this maximum is known as the [[Hayflick limit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hayflick L |author2=Moorhead PS |title=The serial cultivation of human diploid cell strains |journal=Exp. Cell Res. |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=585–621 |date=December 1961 |pmid=13905658 |doi=10.1016/0014-4827(61)90192-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Replicative senescence is the result of [[telomere]] shortening that ultimately triggers a [[DNA damage]] response. Cells can also be induced to senesce via DNA damage in response to elevated [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS), activation of [[oncogene]]s and cell-[[cell fusion]], independent of telomere length.

The cellular senescence theory of aging posits that organismal aging is a consequence of the accumulation of less physiological useful senescent cells.

In many organisms, there is [[asymmetric cell division]], e.g. a [[stem cell]] dividing to produce one stem cell and one non-stem cell.

==Cancer versus cellular senescence tradeoff theory of aging==

Senescent cells within a [[multicellular organism]] can be purged by competition between cells, but this increases the risk of cancer. This leads to an inescapable dilemma between two possibilities - the accumulation of physiologically useless senescent cells, and cancer - both of which lead to increasing rates of mortality with age.&lt;ref name="nelson_2017" /&gt;

==Chemical damage==
[[Image:Edward S. Curtis Collection People 086.jpg|thumb|200px|Elderly [[Klamath people|Klamath]] woman photographed by [[Edward S. Curtis]] in 1924]]

One of the earliest aging theories was the ''Rate of Living Hypothesis'' described by [[Raymond Pearl]] in 1928&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Raymond | last=Pearl |  year=1928 | title=The Rate of Living, Being an Account of Some Experimental Studies on the Biology of Life Duration |  publisher=Alfred A. Knopf | location=New York}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (based on earlier work by [[Max Rubner]]), which states that fast [[basal metabolic rate]] corresponds to short [[maximum life span]].

While there may be some validity to the idea that for various types of specific damage detailed below that are by-products of metabolism, all other things being equal, a fast metabolism may reduce lifespan, in general this theory does not adequately explain the differences in lifespan either within, or between, species. Calorically restricted animals process as much, or more, calories per gram of body mass, as their ''ad libitum'' fed counterparts, yet exhibit substantially longer lifespans.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Similarly, metabolic rate is a poor predictor of lifespan for birds, bats and other species that, it is presumed, have reduced mortality from predation, and therefore have evolved long lifespans even in the presence of very high metabolic rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Brunet-Rossinni AK |author2=Austad SN |title=Ageing studies on bats: a review |journal=Biogerontology |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=211–22 |year=2004 |pmid=15314271 |doi=10.1023/B:BGEN.0000038022.65024.d8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 analysis it was shown that, when modern statistical methods for correcting for the effects of body size and phylogeny are employed, metabolic rate does not correlate with longevity in mammals or birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=de Magalhães JP |author2=Costa J |author3=Church GM |title=An Analysis of the Relationship Between Metabolism, Developmental Schedules, and Longevity Using Phylogenetic Independent Contrasts |journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=149–60 |date=1 February 2007 |pmid=17339640 |pmc=2288695 |url=http://biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/62/2/149.long |doi=10.1093/gerona/62.2.149 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223015347/http://biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/62/2/149.long |archivedate=23 December 2014 |citeseerx=10.1.1.596.2815 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (For a critique of the ''Rate of Living Hypothesis'' see ''Living fast, dying when?''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Speakman JR |author2=Selman C |author3=McLaren JS |author4=Harper EJ |title=Living fast, dying when?

With respect to specific types of chemical damage caused by metabolism, it is suggested that damage to long-lived [[biopolymer]]s, such as structural [[protein]]s or [[DNA]], caused by ubiquitous chemical agents in the body such as [[oxygen]] and [[sugar]]s, are in part responsible for aging. The damage can include breakage of biopolymer chains, [[cross-link]]ing of biopolymers, or chemical attachment of unnatural substituents ([[hapten]]s) to biopolymers.

Under normal [[wikt:aerobic|aerobic]] conditions, approximately 4% of the [[oxygen]] metabolized by [[mitochondria]] is converted to [[superoxide]] ion, which can subsequently be converted to [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[hydroxyl]] [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] and eventually other reactive species including other [[peroxide]]s and [[singlet oxygen]], which can, in turn, generate [[radical (chemistry)|free radical]]s capable of damaging structural proteins and DNA. Certain metal [[ion]]s found in the body, such as [[copper]] and [[iron]], may participate in the process. (In [[Wilson's disease]], a [[genetic disorder|hereditary defect]] that causes the body to retain copper, some of the symptoms resemble accelerated senescence.) These processes termed [[oxidative stress]] are linked to the potential benefits of dietary [[polyphenol]] [[antioxidant]]s, for example in coffee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Freedman ND |author2=Park Y |author3=Abnet CC |author4=Hollenbeck AR |author5=Sinha R |title=Association of coffee drinking with total and cause-specific mortality |journal=N.

[[Sugar]]s such as [[glucose]] and [[fructose]] can react with certain [[amino acid]]s such as [[lysine]] and [[arginine]] and certain DNA bases such as [[guanine]] to produce sugar adducts, in a process called ''[[glycation]]''. These adducts can further rearrange to form reactive species, which can then cross-link the structural proteins or DNA to similar biopolymers or other biomolecules such as non-structural proteins. People with [[diabetes]], who have elevated [[blood sugar]], develop senescence-associated disorders much earlier than the general population, but can delay such disorders by rigorous control of their blood sugar levels. There is evidence that sugar damage is linked to oxidant damage in a process termed ''[[Advanced glycation endproduct|glycoxidation]]''.

Free radicals can damage proteins, [[lipids]] or DNA. Glycation mainly damages proteins. Damaged proteins and lipids accumulate in [[lysosome]]s as [[lipofuscin]]. Chemical damage to structural proteins can lead to loss of function; for example, damage to [[collagen]] of [[blood vessel]] walls can lead to vessel-wall stiffness and, thus, [[hypertension]], and vessel wall thickening and reactive tissue formation ([[atherosclerosis]]); similar processes in the [[kidney]] can lead to [[renal failure]]. Damage to [[enzyme]]s reduces cellular functionality. Lipid [[redox|peroxidation]] of the inner mitochondrial membrane reduces the [[electric potential]] and the ability to generate energy. It is probably no accident that nearly all of the so-called "[[accelerated aging disease]]s" are due to defective [[DNA repair]] enzymes.

It is believed that the [[impact of alcohol on aging]] can be partly explained by alcohol's activation of the [[HPA axis]], which stimulates [[glucocorticoid]] secretion, long-term exposure to which produces symptoms of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Spencer RL |author2=Hutchison KE |title=Alcohol, aging, and the stress response |journal=Alcohol Research &amp; Health |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=272–83 |year=1999 |pmid=10890824 |url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh23-4/272-283.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biomarkers of aging==

If different individuals age at different rates, then fecundity, mortality, and functional capacity might be better predicted by [[biomarker]]s than by chronological age.&lt;ref  name="BakerGT"&gt;{{cite journal | author=George T.

[[Gerontology#Biogerontology|Biogerontologists]] have continued efforts to find and validate biomarkers of aging, but success thus far has been limited. Levels of CD4 and CD8 [[memory T cell]]s and [[naive T cell]]s have been used to give good predictions of the expected lifespan of middle-aged mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Miller RA | title=Biomarkers of aging: prediction of longevity by using age-sensitive T-cell subset determinations in a middle-aged, genetically heterogeneous mouse population| journal=Journals of Gerontology | volume=56 | issue=4 | year=2001 | pages=B180–B186 | id= | pmid=11283189 | doi=10.1093/gerona/56.4.b180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic determinants of aging==
{{Main|Genetics of aging}}

A number of genetic components of aging have been identified using model organisms, ranging from the simple budding [[yeast]] ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' to worms such as ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' and [[Drosophilidae|fruit flies]] (''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''). Study of these organisms has revealed the presence of at least two conserved aging pathways.

Gene expression is imperfectly controlled, and it is possible that random fluctuations in the expression levels of many genes contribute to the aging process as suggested by a study of such genes in yeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Ryley J |author2=Pereira-Smith OM |title=Microfluidics device for single cell gene expression analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae |journal=Yeast |volume=23 |issue=14–15 |pages=1065–73 |year=2006 |pmid=17083143 |doi=10.1002/yea.1412}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual cells, which are genetically identical, nonetheless can have substantially different responses to outside stimuli, and markedly different lifespans, indicating the epigenetic factors play an important role in gene expression and aging as well as genetic factors.

A set of rare hereditary ([[genetics|genetic]]) disorders, each called [[progeria]], has been known for some time. Sufferers exhibit symptoms resembling [[Accelerated aging disease|accelerated aging]], including wrinkled skin. The cause of [[Progeria|Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome]] was reported in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in May 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Mounkes LC |author2=Kozlov S |title=A progeroid syndrome in mice is caused by defects in A-type lamins |journal=Nature |volume=423 |number=6937 |pages=298–301 |year=2003 |url=http://www.nature.com.gate2.inist.fr/nature/journal/v423/n6937/pdf/nature01631.pdf |doi=10.1038/nature01631|pmid=12748643 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This report suggests that [[DNA damage]], not [[oxidative stress]], is the cause of this form of accelerated aging.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4561">'''[[Shamanism]] in [[Pakistan]]''' is found most commonly in the [[Chaprote Nagar Valley]]. Shaman in the local language Shina are referred as 'Dayal'. Shamanism in the area has been linked to its dynamic history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/58900/shamanism-spirits-in-the-valley/|title=Shamanism: Spirits in the valley 
The practitioners, called Danyals, inhale the smoke of burning juniper branches, dance to a special music, enter into ecstatic trances, drink blood from a freshly severed goat’s head and converse with ‘spirits’ to find solution to the problems of the people who come to seek their help, according to anthropologists.
- The Express Tribune|date=2010-10-14|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dayal ==
Dayal is the Shina (language of the [[Gilgit people]]) equivalent of Shaman. Dayals are not like the Eurasian Shamans, as the Eurasian Shamans have some special physical qualities like extra teeth, a sixth finger, or other physical signs. Dayals are normal beings who are selected by the ''Pari'' (the fairy, plural ''pariting'').

Pariting descends to the earth during the cherry and apricot blossom seasons. Pariting choose the dayal from new borns by smelling their noses and mouths. It is not apparent who is a dayal during the childhood. Bitans grow distinct characteristics when they reach teenage. These characteristics includes becoming unconscious, going into a state of ecstasy, or sickness for days or sometimes weeks. A Bitan may die if he (his spirit) resists to be one during the period when the shamanists characteristics start to appear.

Dayal have craving for music (a special tune/composition), on listening to such music they can go into a state of trance where they meet with the pari. Bitans dance to the music during festivals like [[Ginani]] (crop harvesting festival). During the dance, dayal also foretell the next years crop production.

== Shamanic Practices ==
Shamans or the Dayals are believed to have foresight. This foresight is a result of Dayal's interactions with the spirits. These spirits are fairies, ''pari'' (plural ''pariting'') as called in the local language. The ''paris''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' tell the dayals about the future when they are in an ecstatic/trance state. Thus they foretell the future.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The Ritual ===
The ritual to get the dayal into the shamanistic or the ecstatic state, need music, smoke and blood of goat. Music is played by the musicians (''dadag ustadi)''. The orchestra has three instruments, namely ''Dadang'' (Drum), ''Daamal'' (Two hemi-spherical drums) and ''Surnai'' (Shenai) or ''Gabi'' (local variant of Reed Pipe). For the smoke juniper leaves and Syrian rue (local name ''Supandur'') are put on fire. For blood the dayal drinks it from the recently chopped head of a goat (''Chati'').

Dayal starts to dance to the music. While dancing dayal inhales the smoke of juniper leaves simultaneously. Then drinking the blood from ''Chati''. Dayal gets into a higher state as he continues to dance to the music. Reaching the state the dayal starts to speak in ''Shina'' (language of Gilgit). Dayal converses/argues/ask the ''pari'' regarding the concern he has. During the process dayal may pass out. Dayal can go to such state for at most two or three times before he passes out.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=László|first=Csáji|date=2011|title=Flying with the Vanishing Fairies:Typology of the ShamanisticTraditions of the Hunza|url=https://www.academia.edu/5718795/Flying_with_the_Vanishing_Fairies_Typology_of_the_Shamanistic_Traditions_of_the_Hunza|journal=Anthropology of Consciousness|volume=22|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Historians like M.H Sidky, have done extensive research on the topic of Shamanism. Sidky had published a paper on Shamanism in Hunza. Where the author had mentioned the famous Bitans (shamans) of the area, including Huk Mamu and Shon Gakur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sidky|first=M.H.|date=1994|title=Shamans and Mountain Spirits in Hunza|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251986663_Shamans_and_Mountain_Spirits_in_Hunza|journal=Asian Folklove Studies|volume=53|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bitans of Hunza used to tell future by doing the shamanic practices. Bitans were summoned by the Thum/Mir to predict any calamity, famine or any disaster expected in near future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5484">[[File:Woodpecker 02.jpeg|frame|right|Habitat protection measures for this [[Red-cockaded Woodpecker|woodpecker]] tempted landowners to employ the 3-S treatment.]]'''Shooting, shoveling, and shutting up''', also known as the '''3-S treatment''', refers to a method for dealing with unwanted or unwelcome [[animal]]s primarily in rural areas. There have been reports of the frequently illegal triple-step procedure being used to dispatch mischievous [[pet]]s, [[endangered species]], and even sick [[livestock]].  Individuals often engage in this practice as a means to protect property or pets from predatory species that are protected by law, especially if other measures to protect their animals are unfeasible.  For instance, [[Eagle|eagles]], a protected species, have been known to occasionally attack and kill young livestock on ranches.&lt;ref&gt;http://icwdm.org/handbook/birds/eagles.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there have been multiple incidents where [[Hawk|hawks]] have attacked and killed small farm poultry and pets.&lt;ref&gt;http://icwdm.org/handbook/birds/HawksOwls.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  Farmers and pet owners caught killing such animals have been prosecuted, regardless of their reasons for doing so.

When applied to marauding [[dog]]s, the implication is that the offending canine will be killed by [[firearm]] and, as far as the owner is concerned, disappear with no apparent clues because of the reticence of the person employing the method. The phrase was used in this sense in ''Living Well on Practically Nothing'' by Edward H. Romney, who pointed out that while one might get away with using the 3-S treatment in rural areas, suburban neighborhoods have different norms. This practice is more common in rural areas, where there is less population to witness illegal activities.

''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'' columnist Ralph R. Reiland wrote an essay called "Shoot, Shovel &amp; Shut Up,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig4/reiland3.html|title=Shoot, Shovel &amp; Shut Up|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing landowners' reactions to finding [[red-cockaded woodpecker]]s on their property. Under the [[Endangered Species Act]], landowners who have a population of such [[bird]]s on their property may be subject to restrictions on building and other land uses that would interfere with the animals' habitat. Therefore, it was considered prudent to eliminate the birds before the government noticed their presence. The Fall 2001 issue of the ''Sierra Citizen'' notes, "'Shoot, shovel and shut up' is the mantra of many in the so-called 'property rights' movement&amp;nbsp;... It refers to the practice of killing and burying evidence of any plants or animals that might be threatened or endangered."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syrcl.org/sierra-citizen/sc-view_article.asp?id=16 Sierra Citizen] Fall 2001 issue&lt;/ref&gt; The property rights movement argues that the Endangered Species Act should be amended to compensate property owners for protecting endangered species, rather than making an endangered species a financial drain on the owners, and that the current act actually hastens the decline of some endangered species when listed by causing property owners to "shoot, shovel, and shut up" to avoid expected losses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/34933.html] Reason, December 31, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Robbins writes in ''Wolves Across the Border'' that Mon Teigen, director of the Montana Stockgrowers Association, "believes labyrinthine federal endangered species regulations may lead a few ranchers to control [[wolf|wolves]] with the three-S method". In 2005, after a court ruled that ranchers could not shoot wolves caught attacking livestock, the [[Associated Press]] reported that "Sharon Beck, an Eastern Oregon rancher and former president of the Oregon Cattlemen's Association, said the ruling leaves ranchers little recourse but to break the law -- known around the West as 'shoot, shovel and shut up' -- when wolves move into their areas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.propertyrightsresearch.org/2005/articles02/ruling_halts_downgraded_wolf_pro.htm|title=property rights research|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase has also been used in reference to [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|mad cow disease]]. More than 30 countries banned beef imports from Canada after one of [[Alberta]]n farmer Marwyn Peaster's cattle tested positive for the illness. Alberta Premier [[Ralph Klein]], in frustration over the situation, said that any "self-respecting rancher would have shot, shovelled and shut up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calgary.ctvnews.ca/the-people-s-premier-ralph-klein-1942-2013-1.1216511|title=CTVNews|work=Calgary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/latest/story.html?id=8171734&lt;/ref&gt;

Earliest known portrait of Wordsworth, painted in the year he wrote the first drafts of "The Lucy poems"&lt;ref&gt;"[http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/collections/wordsworth.html The Cornell Wordsworth Collection]".

'''The Lucy poems''' are a series of five poems composed by the English [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] poet [[William Wordsworth]] (1770–1850) between 1798 and 1801. All but one were first published during 1800 in the second edition of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', a collaboration between Wordsworth and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] that was both Wordsworth's first major publication and a milestone in the early English [[Romantic poetry|Romantic movement]].&lt;ref group=A&gt;The fifth poem, "[[I travelled among unknown men]]", first appeared in ''Poems in Two Volumes'', published in 1807. Wu 1999, 250&lt;/ref&gt; In the series, Wordsworth sought to write unaffected English verse infused with abstract ideals of beauty, nature, love, longing and death.

The poem was written during a short period while the poet lived in Germany. Although they individually deal with a variety of themes, as a series they focus on the poet's longing for the company of his friend Coleridge, who had travelled with him to Germany but took up residence separately in the university town of Göttingen, and on his increasing impatience with his sister [[Dorothy Wordsworth|Dorothy]], who had travelled with him abroad. Wordsworth examines the poet's unrequited love for the idealised character of Lucy, an English girl who has died young. The idea of her death weighs heavily on the poet throughout the series, imbuing it with a melancholic, [[elegiac]] tone. Whether Lucy was based on a real woman or was a figment of the poet's imagination has long been a matter of debate among scholars. Generally reticent about the poems, Wordsworth never revealed the details of her origin or identity.&lt;ref name="Jones4"&gt;Jones 1995, 4&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars speculate that Lucy is based on his sister Dorothy, while others see her as a fictitious or hybrid character. Most critics agree that she is essentially a literary device upon whom he could project, meditate and reflect.

The "Lucy poems" consist of "[[Strange fits of passion have I known]]", "[[She dwelt among the untrodden ways]]", "[[I travelled among unknown men]]", "[[Three years she grew in sun and shower]]", and "[[A slumber did my spirit seal]]". Although they are presented as a series in modern anthologies, Wordsworth did not conceive of them as a group, nor did he seek to publish the poems in sequence. He described the works as "experimental" in the prefaces to both the 1798 and 1800 editions of ''Lyrical Ballads'', and revised the poems significantly—shifting their thematic emphasis—between 1798 and 1799. Only after his death in 1850 did publishers and critics begin to treat the poems as a fixed group.

In 1798, Wordsworth and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] jointly published ''[[Lyrical Ballads|Lyrical Ballads, with a Few Other Poems]]'', a collection of verses each had written separately. The book became hugely popular and was published widely; it is generally considered a herald of the [[Romantic movement]] in English literature.&lt;ref&gt;Wu 1999, 189–90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert; Allen; and Clark 1962, 198&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Wordsworth aimed to use everyday language in his compositions&lt;ref name="murray5"&gt;Murray 1967, qtd in 5&lt;/ref&gt; as set out in the preface to the 1802 edition: "The principal object, then, proposed in these Poems was to choose incidents and situations from common life, and to relate or describe them, throughout, as far as was possible in a selection of language really used by men, and at the same time, to throw over them a certain colouring of imagination, whereby ordinary things should be presented to the mind in an unusual aspect."&lt;ref name="murray5"/&gt;

The two poets had met three years earlier in either late August or September 1795 in [[Bristol]].&lt;ref&gt;Sisman 2006, 111–112&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting laid the foundation for an intense and profoundly creative friendship, based in part on their shared disdain for the artificial [[diction]] of the poetry of the era. Beginning in 1797, the two lived within walking distance of each other in [[Somerset]], which solidified their friendship. Wordsworth believed that his life before meeting Coleridge was sedentary and dull, and that his poetry amounted to little. Coleridge influenced Wordsworth, and his praise and encouragement inspired Wordsworth to write prolifically.&lt;ref&gt;Matlak 1978, 48&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothy Wordsworth|Dorothy]], Wordsworth's sister, related the effect Coleridge had on her brother in a March 1798 letter: "His faculties seem to expand every day, he composes with much more facility than he did, as to the ''mechanism'' [emphasis in original] of poetry, and his ideas flow faster than he can express them."&lt;ref&gt;Wordsworth 1967, 200&lt;/ref&gt; With his new inspiration, Wordsworth came to believe he could write poetry rivalling that of [[John Milton]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander 1987, 62&lt;/ref&gt; He and Coleridge planned to collaborate, but never moved beyond suggestions and notes for each other.&lt;ref&gt;Gill 1989, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

The expiration of Wordsworth's [[Alfoxton House]] lease soon provided an opportunity for the two friends to live together. They conceived a plan to settle in Germany with Dorothy and Coleridge's wife, Sara, "to pass the two ensuing years in order to acquire the German language, and to furnish ourselves with a tolerable stock of information in natural science".&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to James Losh dated 11 March 1798. Wordsworth 1967, 212&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1798, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Dorothy travelled to Germany to explore proximate living arrangements, but this proved difficult. Although they lived together in Hamburg for a short time, the city was too expensive for their budgets. Coleridge soon found accommodations in the town of [[Ratzeburg]] in Schleswig-Holstein, which was less expensive but still socially vibrant. The impoverished Wordsworth, however, could neither afford to follow Coleridge nor provide for himself and his sister in Hamburg; the siblings instead moved to moderately priced accommodations in [[Goslar]] in Lower Saxony, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Matlak 1978, 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation from Coleridge===
[[Image:SamuelTaylorColeridge.jpg|thumb|230px|left|''Samuel Taylor Coleridge,'' by [[Peter Van Dyke]], 1795. A major poet and one of the foremost critics of the day, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] collaborated on ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' with Wordsworth and remained a close friend and confidant for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Ford 1957, 186–206&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=Half-length portrait of man wearing a black jacket and white shirt with an elaborate white bow at the neck. He has wavy, medium-length brown hair.]]

Between October 1798 and February 1799, Wordsworth worked on the first draft of the "Lucy poems" together with a number of other verses, including the "[[The Matthew poems|Matthew poems]]", "[[Lucy Gray]]" and ''[[The Prelude]]''. Coleridge had yet to join the siblings in Germany, and Wordsworth's separation from his friend depressed him. In the three months following their parting, Wordsworth completed the first three of the "Lucy poems": "Strange fits", "She dwelt", and "A slumber".&lt;ref&gt;Matlak 1978, 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; They first appeared in a letter to Coleridge dated December 1798, in which Wordsworth wrote that "She dwelt" and "Strange fits" were "little Rhyme poems which I hope will amuse you".&lt;ref name="WL236"&gt;Wordsworth 1967, 236&lt;/ref&gt; Wordsworth characterised the two poems thus to mitigate any disappointment Coleridge might suffer in receiving these two poems instead of the promised three-part philosophical epic ''[[The Recluse (poem)|The Recluse]]''.&lt;ref name="Moorman 422"&gt;Moorman 1968, 422&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same letter, Wordsworth complained that:
{{quote|As I have had no books I have been obliged to write in self-defense. I should have written five times as much as I have done but that I am prevented by an uneasiness at my stomach and side, with a dull pain about my heart. I have used the word pain, but uneasiness and heat are words which more accurately express my feelings. At all events it renders writing unpleasant. Reading is now become a kind of luxury to me. When I do not read I am absolutely consumed by thinking and feeling and bodily exertions of voice or of limbs, the consequence of those feelings.&lt;ref name="WL236"/&gt;}}
Wordsworth partially blamed Dorothy for the abrupt loss of Coleridge's company. He felt that their finances—insufficient for supporting them both in Ratzeburg—would have easily supported him alone, allowing him to follow Coleridge. Wordsworth's anguish was compounded by the contrast between his life and that of his friend. Coleridge's financial means allowed him to entertain lavishly and to seek the company of nobles and intellectuals; Wordsworth's limited wealth constrained him to a quiet and modest life. Wordsworth's envy seeped into his letters when he described Coleridge and his new friends as "more favored sojourners" who may "be chattering and chatter'd to, through the whole day".&lt;ref&gt;Matlak 1978, 50; Wordsworth 1967, 254&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Wordsworth sought emotional support from his sister, their relationship remained strained throughout their time in Germany. Separated from his friend and forced to live in the sole company of his sister, Wordsworth used the "Lucy poems" as an emotional outlet.&lt;ref&gt;Matlak 1978, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity of Lucy===
Wordsworth did not reveal the inspiration for the character of Lucy, and over the years the topic has generated intense speculation among literary historians.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams 2000, 251 note 1&lt;/ref&gt; Little biographical information can be drawn from the poems—it is difficult even to determine Lucy's age.&lt;ref&gt;Robson 2001, 33&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-19th century, [[Thomas DeQuincey]] (1785–1859), author and one-time friend of Wordsworth, wrote that the poet "always preserved a mysterious silence on the subject of that 'Lucy', repeatedly alluded to or apostrophised in his poems, and I have heard, from gossiping people about Hawkshead, some snatches of tragic story, which, after all, might be an idle semi-fable, improved out of slight materials."&lt;ref&gt;De Quincey 1839, 247&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic Herbert Hartman believes Lucy's name was taken from "a neo-Arcadian commonplace", and argues she was not intended to represent any single person.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman 1934, 141&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of one Wordsworth biographer, Mary Moorman (1906–1994), "The identity of 'Lucy' has been the problem of critics for many years. But Wordsworth is a poet before he is a biographer, and neither 'Lucy' nor her home nor his relations with her are necessarily in the strict sense historical. Nevertheless, as the ''Lyrical Ballads'' were all of them 'founded on fact' in some way, and as Wordsworth's mind was essentially factual, it would be rash to say that Lucy is entirely fictitious."&lt;ref name="m423"/&gt;

Moorman suggests that Lucy may represent Wordsworth's romantic interest Mary Hutchinson,&lt;ref group=A&gt;Critics strongly contested this assertion; see Margoliouth 1966, 52&lt;/ref&gt; but wonders why she would be represented as one who died.&lt;ref name="Moorman424"&gt;Moorman 1968, 423–424&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Wordsworth was thinking of Margaret Hutchinson, Mary's sister who had died.&lt;ref&gt;Margoliouth, 1966 52–56&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence, however, that the poet loved any of the Hutchinsons other than Mary. It is more likely that Margaret's death influenced but is not the foundation for Lucy.&lt;ref&gt;Moorman 1968, 425&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dorothy Wordsworth 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[W. Crowbent]], 1907, ''Portrait of Dorothy Wordsworth'', depicting her later in life, (drawing from a photograph).|alt=Half-length portrait of a woman wearing a frilly cap. She is in bed, with a book, her glasses, and her dog.]]
In 1980, [[Hunter Davies]] contended that the series was written for the poet's sister Dorothy, but found the Lucy–Dorothy allusion "bizarre".&lt;ref name="Davies p. 101"&gt;Davies 1980, 101&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, literary critic Richard Matlak tried to explain the Lucy–Dorothy connection, and wrote that Dorothy represented a financial burden to Wordsworth, which had effectively forced his separation from Coleridge.&lt;ref name="Matlak 46"&gt;Matlak 1978, 46&lt;/ref&gt; Wordsworth, depressed over the separation from his friend, in this interpretation, expresses both his love for his sister and fantasies about her loss through the poems.&lt;ref name="Matlak 46"/&gt; Throughout the poems, the narrator's mixture of mourning and antipathy is accompanied by denial and guilt; his denial of the Lucy–Dorothy relationship and the lack of narratorial responsibility for the death of Lucy allow him to escape from questioning his desires for the death of his sister.&lt;ref&gt;Matlak 1978, 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; After Wordsworth began the "Lucy poems", Coleridge wrote, "Some months ago Wordsworth transmitted to me a most sublime Epitaph / whether it had any reality, I cannot say. —Most probably, in some gloomier moment he had fancied the moment in which his Sister might die."&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2000, qtd in 464&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, possible that Wordsworth simply feared her death and did not wish it, even subconsciously.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1995, 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Further examples of Lucy representing Dorothy can be found in "The Glow-Worm" and "Nutting". A recently published version of "Nutting" makes the connection between Dorothy and Lucy more explicit, and suggests that the play with the incest prohibition came equally from Dorothy as from William. See Johnston 2000, 465&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting on the significance and relevance of Lucy's identity, the 19th-century poet, essayist and literary critic [[Frederic William Henry Myers|Frederic Myers]] (1843–1901) observed that:
{{quote|here it was that the memory of some emotion prompted the lines on "Lucy". Of the history of that emotion, he has told us nothing; I forbear, therefore, to inquire concerning it, or even to speculate. That it was to the poet's honour, I do not doubt; but who ever learned such secrets rightly? or who should wish to learn? It is best to leave the sanctuary of all hearts inviolate, and to respect the reserve not only of the living but of the dead. Of these poems, almost alone, Wordsworth in his autobiographical notes has said nothing whatever.&lt;ref&gt;Myers 1906, 34&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Literary scholar [[Karl Kroeber]] (1926–2009) argues that Lucy "possesses a double existence; her actual, historical existence and her idealised existence in the poet's mind. In the poem, Lucy is both actual and idealised, but her actuality is relevant only insofar as it makes manifest the significance implicit in the actual girl."&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber 1964, 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; Hartman holds the same view; to him Lucy is seen "entirely from within the poet, so that this modality may be the poet's own", but then he argues, "she belongs to the category of spirits who must still become human&amp;nbsp;... the poet describes her as dying at a point at which she would have been humanized."&lt;ref name="Hartman 158"&gt;Hartman 1967, 158&lt;/ref&gt; The literary historian Kenneth Johnston concludes that Lucy was created as the personification of Wordsworth's [[muse]], and the group as a whole "is a series of invocations to a Muse feared to be dead...As epitaphs, they are not sad, a very inadequate word to describe them, but breathlessly, almost wordlessly aware of what such a loss would mean to the speaker: 'oh, the difference to me!'"&lt;ref name="Johnston p. 463"&gt;Johnston 2000, 463&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar John Mahoney observes that whether Lucy is intended to represent Dorothy, Mary or another is much less important to understanding the poems than the fact that she represented "a hidden being who seems to lack flaws and is alone in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney 1997, 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, she is represented as being insignificant in the public sphere but of the utmost importance in the private sphere; in "She dwelt" this manifests through the comparison of Lucy to both a hidden flower and a shining star.&lt;ref&gt;Bateson 1954, 33&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Lucy nor Wordsworth's other female characters "exist as independent self-conscious human beings with minds as capable of the poet's" and are "rarely allowed to speak for themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Mellor 1993, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==The poems==
The "Lucy poems" are written from the point of view of a lover who has long viewed the object of his affection from afar, and who is now affected by her death.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Most of the poems Wordsworth wrote while living in Goslar were about people who had died or were about to die. Johnston 2000, 463&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Wordsworth structured the poems so that they are not about any one person who has died; instead they were written about a figure representing the poet's lost inspiration. Lucy is Wordsworth's inspiration, and the poems as a whole are, according to Wordsworth biographer Kenneth Johnston, "invocations to a Muse feared to be dead".&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2000, 463&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy is represented in all five poems as sexless; it is unlikely that the poet ever realistically saw her as a possible lover. Instead, she is presented as an ideal&lt;ref name="J465"&gt;Johnston 2000, 465&lt;/ref&gt; and represents Wordsworth's frustration at his separation from Coleridge; the asexual imagery reflects the futility of his longing.&lt;ref name="J465" /&gt;

Wordsworth's voice slowly disappears from the poems as they progress, and his voice is entirely absent from the fifth poem. His love operates on the subconscious level, and he relates to Lucy more as a spirit of nature than as a human being.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman 1964, 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; The poet's grief is private, and he is unable to fully explain its source.&lt;ref&gt;Grob 1973, 201–202&lt;/ref&gt; When Lucy's lover is present, he is completely immersed in human interactions and the human aspects of nature, and the death of his beloved is a total loss for the lover. The 20th-century critic Spencer Hall argues that the poet represents a "fragile kind of humanism".&lt;ref&gt;Hall 1971, 160–161&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Strange fits of passion have I known"===
{{main article|Strange fits of passion have I known}}
{{Wikisource|Strange Fits of Passion Have I Known}}
"Strange fits" is probably the earliest of the poems and revolves around a fantasy of Lucy's death. It describes the narrator's journey to Lucy's cottage and his thoughts along the way. Throughout, the motion of the moon is set in opposition to the motion of the speaker. The poem contains seven [[stanza]]s, a relatively elaborate structure which underscores his ambivalent attitude towards Lucy's imagined death. The constant shifts in perspective and mood reflect his conflicting emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Matlak 1978, 51&lt;/ref&gt; The first stanza, with its use of dramatic phrases such as "fits of passion" and "dare to tell", contrasts with the subdued tone of the rest of the poem. As a lyrical [[ballad]], "Strange fits" differs from the traditional ballad form, which emphasises abnormal action, and instead focuses on mood.&lt;ref name="hart23"&gt;Hartman 1967, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of death is felt throughout the poem, although it is mentioned explicitly only in the final line. The moon, a symbol of the beloved, sinks steadily as the poem progresses, until its abrupt drop in the penultimate stanza. That the speaker links Lucy with the moon is clear, though his reasons are unclear.&lt;ref name="hart23"/&gt; The moon nevertheless plays a significant role in the action of the poem: as the lover imagines the moon slowly sinking behind Lucy's cottage, he is entranced by its motion. By the fifth stanza, the speaker has been lulled into a somnambulistic trance—he sleeps while still keeping his eyes on the moon (lines 17–20).

The narrator's conscious presence is wholly absent from the next stanza, which moves forward in what literary theorist [[Geoffrey Hartman]] describes as a "motion approaching yet never quite attaining its end".&lt;ref&gt;Hartman 1967, 24&lt;/ref&gt; When the moon abruptly drops behind the cottage, the narrator snaps out of his dream, and his thoughts turn towards death. Lucy, the beloved, is united with the landscape in death, while the image of the retreating, entrancing moon is used to portray the idea of looking beyond one's lover.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman 1967, 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; The darker possibility also remains that the dream state represents the fulfilment of the lover's fantasy through the death of the beloved. In falling asleep while approaching his beloved's home, the lover betrays his own reluctance to be with Lucy.&lt;ref name="Matlak 53"&gt;Matlak 1978, 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Wordsworth made numerous revisions to each of the "Lucy poems".&lt;ref name = "jones8"/&gt; The earliest version of "Strange fits" appears in a December 1798 letter from Dorothy to Coleridge. This draft contains many differences in phrasing and does not include a stanza that appeared in the final published version. The new lines direct the narrative towards "the Lover's ear alone", implying that only other lovers can understand the relationship between the moon, the beloved and the beloved's death.&lt;ref&gt;Matlak 1978, 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; Wordsworth also removed from the final stanza the lines:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
I told her this; her laughter light
Is ringing in my ears;
And when I think upon that night
My eyes are dim with tears.&lt;ref&gt;Wordsworth 1967, 237–238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}
This final stanza lost its significance with the completion of the later poems in the series, and the revision allowed for a sense of anticipation at the poem's close and helped draw the audience into the story of the remaining "Lucy poems". Of the other changes, only the description of the horse's movement is important: "My horse trudg'd on" becomes "With quickening pace my horse drew nigh", which heightens the narrator's vulnerability to fantasies and dreams in the revised version.&lt;ref name="Matlak 53"/&gt;

==="She dwelt among the untrodden ways"===
{{Main article|She dwelt among the untrodden ways}}
{{Wikisource|She Dwelt Among the Untrodden Ways}}
"She dwelt among the untrodden ways" presents Lucy as having lived in solitude near the source of the River Dove.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Wordsworth knew three rivers of that name; in [[River Dove, Central England|Derbyshire]], [[River Dove, North Yorkshire|Yorkshire]] and Westmorland, but each could equally be the setting for the verse.&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary critic Geoffrey Durrant, the poem charts her "growth, perfection, and death".&lt;ref name="Durrant p. 61"&gt;Durrant 1969, 61&lt;/ref&gt; To convey the dignified, unaffected naturalness of his subject, Wordsworth uses simple language, mostly words of one syllable. In the opening [[quatrain]], he describes the isolated and untouched area where Lucy lived, as well as her innocence and beauty, which he compares to that of a hidden flower in the second.&lt;ref name="jones36"&gt;Jones, 36&lt;/ref&gt; The poem begins in a descriptive rather than narrative manner, and it is not until the line "When Lucy ceased to be" that the reader is made aware that the subject of the verse has died. Literary scholar Mark Jones describes this effect as finding the poem is "over before it has begun", while according to writer [[Margaret Oliphant]] (1828–1897), Lucy "is dead before we so much as heard of her".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucy's "untrodden ways" are symbolic of both her physical isolation and the unknown details of her thoughts and life. The third quatrain is written with an economy intended to capture the simplicity the narrator sees in Lucy. Her femininity is described in girlish terms. This has drawn criticism from those who see the female icon, in the words of literary scholar John Woolford, "represented in Lucy by condemning her to death while denying her the actual or symbolic fulfillment of maternity".&lt;ref name="Woolford"/&gt; To evoke the "loveliness of body and spirit", a pair of complementary but paradoxical images&lt;ref name="jones36" /&gt; are employed in the second stanza: the solitary, hidden [[Viola (plant)|violet]] juxtaposed to the publicly visible [[Venus]], [[Venus (mythology)|emblem of love]] and first star of evening.&lt;ref&gt;Ober and Ober 2005, 31&lt;/ref&gt; Wondering if Lucy more resembles the violet or the star, the critic [[Cleanth Brooks]] (1906–1994) concludes that while Wordsworth likely views her as "the single star, completely dominating [his] world, not arrogantly like the sun, but sweetly and modestly", the metaphor is a conventional compliment with only vague relevance.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks 1951, 729–741&lt;/ref&gt; For Wordsworth, Lucy's appeal is closer to the violet and lies in her seclusion and her perceived affinity with nature.&lt;ref name="Woolford"&gt;Woolford 2003, 30–35&lt;/ref&gt;

Wordsworth acquired a copy of the [[antiquarian]] and [[Bishop|churchman]] [[Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy's]] (1729–1811) collection of British ballads ''[[Reliques of Ancient English Poetry]]'' (1765) in Hamburg a few months before he began to compose the series. The influence of the traditional English folk ballad is evident in the [[metre (poetry)|metre]], rhythm and structure of "She dwelt". It follows the variant ballad stanza a4–b3–a4–b3,&lt;ref&gt;Ober and Ober 2005, 30&lt;/ref&gt; and in keeping with ballad tradition tells a dramatic story. As Durrant observed, "To confuse the mode of the 'Lucy' poems with that of the love lyric is to overlook their structure, in which, as in the traditional ballad, a story is told as boldly and briefly as possible."&lt;ref name="Durrant p. 61"/&gt; Kenneth and Warren Ober compare the opening lines of "She dwelt" to the traditional ballad "[[Katharine Jaffray]]" and note similarities in rhythm and structure, as well as in theme and imagery:

&lt;center&gt;
{| border="0" cellpadding="1"
|+
! "Katharine Jaffray" !!  !! "She dwelt"
|-
| &lt;poem&gt;There livd a lass in yonder dale,
And doun in yonder glen, O.
And Katherine Jaffray was her name,

&lt;/poem&gt;
 || &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ||
&lt;poem&gt;
She dwelt among the untrodden ways
Beside the springs of Dove,
A maid whom there were none to praise
And very few to love; (lines 1–4)
&lt;/poem&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The narrator of the poem is less concerned with the experience of observing Lucy than with his reflections and meditations on his observations.&lt;ref&gt;Slakey 1972, 629&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the poem sadness and ecstasy are intertwined, a fact emphasised by the exclamation marks in the second and third verses. The critic Carl Woodring writes that "She dwelt" and the Lucy series can be read as [[elegiac]], as "sober meditation[s] on death". He found that they have "the economy and the general air of epitaphs in the [[Greek mythology|Greek Anthology]]... [I]f all elegies are mitigations of death, the Lucy poems are also meditations on simple beauty, by distance made more sweet and by death preserved in distance".&lt;ref&gt;Woodring 1965, 44 and 48&lt;/ref&gt;

An early draft of "She dwelt" contained two stanzas which had been omitted from the first edition.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams 2000, A-4 note 1&lt;/ref&gt; The revisions exclude many of the images but emphasise the grief that the narrator experienced. The original version began with floral imagery, which was later cut:&lt;ref&gt;Matlak 1978, 55&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
My hope was one, from cities far,
Nursed on a lonesome heath;
Her lips were red as roses are,
Her hair a woodbine wreath.&lt;ref name="Wordsworth 236–237"&gt;Wordsworth 1967, 236–237&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;}}
A fourth stanza, also later removed, included an explanation of how Lucy was to die:&lt;ref&gt;Matlak 1978, 54&lt;/ref&gt; "But slow distemper checked her bloom / And on the Heath she died."&lt;ref name="Wordsworth 236–237"/&gt;

==="I travelled among unknown men"===
{{Main article|I travelled among unknown men}}
{{wikisource|I travelled among unknown men}}
The last of the "Lucy poems" to be composed, "I travelled among unknown men", was the only one not included in the second edition of ''Lyrical Ballads''. Although Wordsworth claimed that the poem was composed while he was still in Germany, it was in fact written during April 1801.&lt;ref name="Moorman 422"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "jones8"&gt;Jones 1995, 8&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for this later date comes from a letter Wordsworth wrote to Mary Hutchinson referring to "I travelled" as a newly created poem.&lt;ref&gt;Beatty 1964, 46 and 92&lt;/ref&gt; In 1802, he instructed his printer to place "I travelled" immediately after "A slumber did my spirit seal" in ''Lyrical Ballads'', but the poem was omitted. It was later published in ''[[Poems, in Two Volumes]]'' in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Wu 1998, 250&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem has frequently been read as a declaration of Wordsworth's love for his native England&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1995, 40&lt;/ref&gt; and his determination not to live abroad again:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
'Tis past, that melancholy dream!
Nor will I quit thy shore
A second time; for still I seem
To love thee more and more. (lines 5–8)
&lt;/poem&gt;}}
The first two stanzas seem to speak of the poet's personal experience,&lt;ref&gt;Beatty 1964, 46&lt;/ref&gt; and a patriotic reading would reflect his appreciation and pride for the English landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1995, 41&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility remains, however, that Wordsworth is referring to England as a physical rather than a political entity, an interpretation that gains strength from the poem's connections to the other "Lucy poems".&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1995, 40–41&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucy only appears in the second half of the poem, where she is linked with the English landscape. As such, it seems as if nature joins with the narrator in mourning for her, and the reader is drawn into this mutual sorrow.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1977, 185–186&lt;/ref&gt;

Although "I travelled" was written two years after the other poems in the series, it echoes the earlier verses in both tone and language.&lt;ref name="m423"&gt;Moorman 1968, 423&lt;/ref&gt; Wordsworth gives no hint as to the identity of Lucy, and although he stated in the preface to ''Lyrical Ballads'' that all the poems were "founded on fact", knowing the basis for the character of Lucy is not necessary to appreciating the poem and understanding its sentiment.&lt;ref name="m423" /&gt; Similarly, no insight can be gained from determining the exact geographical location of the "springs of Dove"; in his youth, Wordsworth had visited springs of that name in [[Derbyshire]], [[Patterdale]] and [[Yorkshire]].&lt;ref name="m423" /&gt;

==="Three years she grew in sun and shower"===
{{main article|Three years she grew in sun and shower}}
{{Wikisource|Three Years She Grew in Sun and Shower}}
"Three years she grew in sun and shower" was composed between 6 October and 28 December 1798. The poem depicts the relationship between Lucy and nature through a complex opposition of [[Imagery (literature)|images]]. [[antithesis|Antithetical]] couplings of words—"sun and shower", "law and impulse", "earth and heaven", "kindle and restrain"—are used to evoke the opposing forces inherent in nature. A conflict between nature and humanity is described, as each attempts to possess Lucy. The poem contains both [[Epithalamium|epithalamic]] and [[Elegy|elegiac]] characteristics; Lucy is shown as wedded to nature, while her human lover is left alone to mourn in the knowledge that death has separated her from humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Grob 1973, 202–203&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisource|A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal}}
Written in spare language, "A slumber did my spirit seal" consists of two stanzas, each four lines long. The first stanza is built upon even, [[sleep|soporific]] movement in which [[Literal and figurative language|figurative language]] conveys the nebulous image of a girl who "seemed a thing that could not feel / The touch of earthly years". The second maintains the quiet and even tone of the first but serves to undermine its sense of the eternal by revealing that Lucy has died and that the calmness of the first stanza represents death. The narrator's response to her death lacks bitterness or emptiness; instead he takes consolation from the fact that she is now beyond life's trials, and "at last&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;in inanimate community with the earth's natural fixtures".&lt;ref&gt;Ford 1957, 165&lt;/ref&gt; The lifeless rocks and stones depicted in the concluding line convey the finality of Lucy's death.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch 1998, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grouping as a series==
Although the "Lucy poems" share stylistic and thematic similarities, it was not Wordsworth but literary critics who first presented the five poems as a unified set called the "Lucy poems". The grouping was originally suggested by critic Thomas Powell in 1831 and later advocated by Margaret Oliphant in an 1871 essay. The 1861 ''Golden Treasury'', compiled by the English historian [[Francis Palgrave]] (1788–1861), groups only four of the verses, omitting "Strange fits". The poems next appeared as a complete set of five in the collection of Wordsworth's poems by English poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] (1822–1888).&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1995, 7–10&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Margaret Oliphant Wilson Oliphant.jpg|thumb|Frederick Augustus Sandys (1829–1904), ''[[Margaret Oliphant]],'' chalk, 1881. In 1875, she was one of the first anthologists to group together the "Lucy poems".|alt=Head and shoulders of an elderly woman wearing a grey dress and a white cap, with her hair pulled back in a bun]]

The grouping and sequence of the "Lucy poems" has been a matter of debate in literary circles. Various critics have sought to add poems to the group; among those proposed over the years are "[[Alcaeus to Sappho]]", "[[Among all lovely things]]", "[[Lucy Gray]]", "[[Surprised by joy]]", "[[Tis said, that some have died for love]]", "[[Louisa (poem)|Louisa]]", "[[Nutting (poem)|Nutting]]", "[[Presentiments]]", "[[She was a Phantom of delight]]", "[[The Danish Boy]]", "[[The Two April Mornings]]", "[[To a Young Lady]]", and "[[Written in Very Early Youth]]".&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1995, 10&lt;/ref&gt; None of the proposals have met with widespread acceptance. The five poems included in the Lucy "canon" focus on similar themes of nature, beauty, separation and loss, and most follow the same basic [[ballad]] form. Literary scholar Mark Jones offers a general characterisation of a Lucy poem as "an untitled lyrical ballad that either mentions Lucy or is always placed with another poem that does, that either explicitly mentions her death or is susceptible of such a reading, and that is spoken by Lucy's lover."&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1995, 11&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of "A slumber", all of the poems mention Lucy by name. The decision to include this work is based in part on Wordsworth's decision to place it in close proximity to "Strange fits" and directly after "She dwelt" within ''Lyrical Ballads''. In addition, "I travelled" was sent to the poet's childhood friend and later wife, Mary Hutchinson, with a note that said it should be "read after 'She dwelt'".&lt;ref name="Moorman 422" /&gt; Coleridge biographer J. Dykes Campbell records that Wordsworth instructed "I travelled" to be included directly following "A slumber", an arrangement that indicates a connection between the poems.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1995, 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the question of inclusion is further complicated by Wordsworth's eventual retraction of these instructions and his omission of "I travelled" from the two subsequent editions of ''Lyrical Ballads''.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1995, 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1815 edition of ''Lyrical Ballads'' organised the poems into the ''Poems Founded on the Affections'' ("Strange fits", "She dwelt", and "I travelled") and ''Poems of the Imagination'' ("Three years she grew" and "A slumber"). This arrangement allowed the two dream-based poems ("Strange fits" and "A slumber") to frame the series and to represent the speaker's different sets of experiences over the course of the longer narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Taaffe 1966, 175&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of chronology, "I travelled" was written last, and thus also served as a symbolic conclusion—both emotionally and thematically—to the "Lucy poems".&lt;ref name="Matlak 47"&gt;Matlak 1978, 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==

===Nature===
According to critic Norman Lacey, Wordsworth built his reputation as a "poet of nature".&lt;ref&gt;Lacey 1948, 1&lt;/ref&gt; Early works, such as "[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Tintern Abbey]]", can be viewed as [[ode]]s to his experience of nature. His poems can also be seen as [[Lyric poetry|lyrical]] meditations on the fundamental character of the natural world. Wordsworth said that, as a youth, nature stirred "an appetite, a feeling and a love", but by the time he wrote ''Lyrical Ballads'', it evoked "the still sad music of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;Lacey 1948, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The five "Lucy poems" are often interpreted as representing Wordsworth's opposing views of nature as well as meditations on the cycle of life. They describe a variety of relationships between humanity and nature.&lt;ref name="J190"&gt;Jones 1995, 190&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Lucy can be seen as a connection between humanity and nature, as a "boundary being, nature sprite and human, yet not quite either. She reminds us of the traditional mythical person who lives, ontologically, an intermediate life, or mediates various realms of existence."&lt;ref name="Hartman 158"/&gt; Although the poems evoke a sense of loss, they also hint at the completeness of Lucy's life—she was raised by nature and survives in the memories of others.&lt;ref&gt;Beer 1978, 98&lt;/ref&gt; She became, in the opinion of the American poet and writer [[David Ferry (poet)|David Ferry]] (b. 1924), "not so much a human being as a sort of compendium of nature", while "her death was right, after all, for by dying she was one with the natural processes that made her die, and fantastically ennobled thereby".&lt;ref&gt;Ferry 1959, 76–78&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleanth Brooks writes that "Strange fits" presents "Kind Nature's gentlest boon", "Three years" its duality, and "A slumber" the clutter of natural object.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks 1951, 736&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars see "She dwelt", along with "I travelled", as representing nature's "rustication and disappearance".&lt;ref name="J190"/&gt; Mahoney views "Three years" as describing a masculine, benevolent nature similar to a [[creator deity]]. Although nature shapes Lucy over time and she is seen as part of nature herself, the poem shifts abruptly when she dies. Lucy appears to be eternal, like nature itself.&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney 1993, 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, she becomes part of the surrounding landscape in life, and her death only verifies this connection.&lt;ref&gt;Robson 2001, 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;

The series presents nature as a force by turns benevolent and malign.&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney 1997, 105&lt;/ref&gt; It is shown at times to be oblivious to and uninterested in the safety of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1995, 198–199&lt;/ref&gt; Hall argues, "In all of these poems, nature would seem to betray the heart that loves her".&lt;ref&gt;Hall 1979, 166&lt;/ref&gt; The imagery used to evoke these notions serves to separate Lucy from everyday reality. The literary theorist [[Frances Ferguson]] (b. 1947) notes that the "flower similes and metaphors become impediments rather than aids to any imaginative visualization of a woman; the flowers do not simply locate themselves in Lucy's cheeks, they expand to absorb the whole of her ... The act of describing seems to have lost touch with its goal—description of Lucy."&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1977, 175&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
The poems Wordsworth wrote while in Goslar focus on the dead and dying. The "Lucy poems" follow this trend, and often fail to delineate the difference between life and death.&lt;ref name="Johnston p. 463"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayden 1992, 157&lt;/ref&gt; Each creates an ambiguity between the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and nothingness,&lt;ref&gt;Beer 1978, 199&lt;/ref&gt; as they attempt to reconcile the question of how to convey the death of a girl intimately connected to nature.&lt;ref&gt;Beer 1978, 95&lt;/ref&gt; They describe a rite of passage from innocent childhood to corrupted maturity and, according to Hartman, "center on a death or a radical change of consciousness which is expressed in semi-mythical form; and they are, in fact, Wordsworth's nearest approach to a personal myth."&lt;ref&gt;Hartman 1967, 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator is affected greatly by Lucy's death and cries out in "She dwelt" of "the difference to me!". Yet in "A slumber" he is spared from trauma by sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney 1997, 106&lt;/ref&gt;

The reader's experience of Lucy is filtered through the narrator's perception.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman 1967, 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; Her death suggests that nature can bring pain to all, even to those who loved her.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman 1967, 161&lt;/ref&gt; According to the British classical and literary scholar [[H. W. Garrod]] (1878–1960), "The truth is, as I believe, that between Lucy's perfection in Nature and her death there is, for Wordsworth, really no tragic antithesis at all."&lt;ref&gt;Garrod 1929, 83&lt;/ref&gt; Hartman expands on this view to extend the view of death and nature to art in general: "Lucy, living, is clearly a guardian spirit, not of one place but of all English places&amp;nbsp;... while Lucy, dead, has all nature for her monument. The series is a deeply humanized version of the death of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], a lament on the decay of English natural feeling. Wordsworth fears that the very spirit presiding over his poetry is ephemeral, and I think he refuses to distinguish between its death in him and its historical decline."&lt;ref name="Hartman p. 43"/&gt;

==Critical assessment==
The first mention of the poems came from Dorothy, in a letter sent to Coleridge in December 1798. Of "Strange fits", she wrote, "[this] next poem is a favorite of mine—i.e. of me Dorothy—".&lt;ref&gt;Wordsworth 1991, 237&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded mention of any of the "Lucy poems" (outside of notes by either William or Dorothy) occurred after the April 1799 death of Coleridge's son Berkeley. Coleridge was then living in Germany, and received the news through a letter from his friend [[Thomas Poole (tanner)|Thomas Poole]], who in his condolences mentioned Wordsworth's "A slumber":
{{quote|But I cannot truly say that I grieve—I am perplexed—I am sad—and a little thing, a very trifle would make me weep; but for the death of the Baby I have ''not'' wept!—Oh! this strange, strange, strange Scene-shifter, Death! that giddies one with insecurity, &amp; so unsubstantiates the living Things that one has grasped and handled!—/ Some months ago Wordsworth transmitted to me a most sublime Epitaph / whether it had any reality, I cannot say.—Most probably, in some gloomier moment he had fancied the moment in which his sister might die.&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge 1956–1971, 479&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He is wearing a brown suit and is set against a brown, blue, and purple background that is reminiscent of rocks and clouds.]]
Later, the essayist [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]] (1775–1834) wrote to Wordsworth in 1801 to say that "She dwelt" was one of his favourites from ''Lyrical Ballads''. Likewise Romantic poet [[John Keats]] (1795–1821) praised the poem. To the diarist and writer [[Henry Crabb Robinson]] (1775–1867), "She dwelt" gave "the powerful effect of the loss of a very obscure object upon one tenderly attached to it—the opposition between the apparent strength of the passion and the insignificance of the object is delightfully conceived."&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 1938, 191&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides word of mouth and opinions in letters, there were only a few published contemporary reviews. The writer and journalist [[John Stoddart]] (1773–1856), in a review of ''Lyrical Ballads'', described "Strange fits" and "She dwelt" as "the most singular specimens of unpretending, yet irresistible pathos".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Jones 1995, 56&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymous review of ''Poems in Two Volumes'' in 1807 had a less positive opinion about "I travell'd": "Another string of flat lines about Lucy is succeeded by an ode to Duty".&lt;ref&gt;''Le Beau Monde'' 2, October 1807, 140&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Francis Jeffrey, Lord Jeffrey|Francis Jeffrey]] (1773–1850) claimed that, in "Strange fits", "Mr Wordsworth, however, has thought fit to compose a piece, illustrating this copious subject by one single thought. A lover trots away to see his mistress one fine evening, staring all the way at the moon: when he comes to her door, 'O mercy! to myself I cried, / If Lucy should be dead!' And there the poem ends!"&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey 1808, 136&lt;/ref&gt; On "A slumber did my spirit seal", Wordsworth's friend Thomas Powell wrote that the poem "stands by itself, and is without title prefixed, yet we are to know, from the penetration of Mr. Wordsworth's admirers, that it is a sequel to the other deep poems that precede it, and is about one Lucy, who is dead. From the table of contents, however, we are informed by the author that it is about 'A Slumber;' for this is the actual title which he has condescended to give it, to put us out of pain as to what it is about."&lt;ref&gt;Powell 1831, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Victorian era|Victorian]] critics appreciated the emotion of the "Lucy poems" and focused on "Strange fits". John Wilson, a personal friend of both Wordsworth and Coleridge, described the poem in 1842 as "powerfully pathetic".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1842, 328&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, critic Rev. Francis Jacox, writing under the pseudonym "Parson Frank", remarked that "Strange fits" contained "true pathos. We are moved to our soul's centre by sorrow expressed as that is; for, without periphrasis or wordy anguish, without circumlocution of officious and obtrusive, and therefore, artificial grief; the mourner gives sorrow words... But he does it in words as few as may be: how intense their beauty!"&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1995, qtd in 4&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, John Wright, an early Wordsworth commentator, described the contemporary perception that "Strange fits" had a "deep but subdued and 'silent fervour'".&lt;ref&gt;Wright 1853, 29&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviewers emphasised the importance of "She dwelt among the untrodden ways", including Scottish writer [[William Angus Knight]] (1836–1916), when he described the poem as an "incomparable twelve lines".&lt;ref&gt;Knight 1889, 282&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, literary critic David Rannie praised the poems as a whole: "that strange little lovely group, which breathe a passion unfamiliar to Wordsworth, and about which he—so ready to talk about the genesis of his poems—has told us nothing [...] Let a poet keep some of his secrets: we need not grudge him the privacy when the poetry is as beautiful as this; when there is such celebration of girlhood, love, and death [...] The poet's sense of loss is sublime in its utter simplicity. He finds harmony rather than harshness in the contrast between the illusion of love and the fact of death."&lt;ref&gt;Rannie 1907, 121, 123&lt;/ref&gt; Later critics focused on the importance of the poems to Wordsworth's poetic technique. Durrant argued that "The four 'Lucy' poems which appeared in the 1800 edition of ''Lyrical Ballads'' are worth careful attention, because they represent the clearest examples of the success of Wordsworth's experiment."&lt;ref&gt;Durrant 1969, 60&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Grob (1932–2007) focused less on the unity that the poems represent and believed that "the principal importance of the 'Matthew' and 'Lucy' poems, apart from their intrinsic achievement, substantial as that is, is in suggesting the presence of seeds of discontent even in a period of seemingly assured faith that makes the sequence of developments in the history of Wordsworth's thought a more orderly, evolving pattern than the chronological leaps between stages would seem to imply."&lt;ref&gt;Grob 1973, 204&lt;/ref&gt;

Later critics de-emphasised the significance of the poems in Wordsworth's artistic development. Hunter Davies (b. 1936) concluded that their impact relies more on their popularity than importance to Wordsworth's poetic career. Davies went on to claim, "The poems about Lucy are perhaps Wordsworth's best-known work which he did in Germany, along with 'Nutting' and the Matthew poems, but the most ''important'' work was the beginning of ''The Prelude''" (emphasis in original).&lt;ref name="Davies p. 101"/&gt; Some critics emphasised the importance behind Lucy as a figure, including Geoffrey Hartman (b. 1929), when he claimed, "It is in the Lucy poems that the notion of spirit of place, and particularly English spirit of place, reaches its purest form."&lt;ref name="Hartman p. 43"&gt;Hartman 1987, 43&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and poet [[Meena Alexander]] (b. 1951) believed that the character of Lucy "is the impossible object of the poet's desire, an iconic representation of the Romantic feminine."&lt;ref name="Alexander p. 147"&gt;Alexander 1989, 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parodies and allusions==
The "Lucy poems" have been [[parody|parodied]] numerous times since their first publication. These were generally intended to ridicule the simplification of textual complexities and deliberate ambiguities in poetry. They also questioned the way many 19th-century critics sought to establish definitive readings. According to Jones, such parodies commented in a "[[meta]]-critical" manner and themselves present an alternative mode of criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1995, 95&lt;/ref&gt; Among the more notable is the one by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's son [[Hartley Coleridge]] (1796–1849), called "On William Wordsworth"&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton 1888, 95&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "Imitation", as in the 1827 version published for ''[[The Inspector]]'' magazine ("He lived amidst th' untrodden ways / To Rydal Lake that lead; / A Bard whom there were none to praise / And very few to read" lines 1–4).&lt;ref&gt;Hartley 1827, 40&lt;/ref&gt; Parody also appears in the 1888 murder-mystery reading of the poem by Victorian author [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] (1835–1902). Butler believed Wordsworth's use of the phrase "the difference to me!" was overly terse, and remarked that the poet was "most careful not to explain the nature of the difference which the death of Lucy will occasion him to be ... The superficial reader takes it that he is very sorry she was dead&amp;nbsp;... but he has not said this."&lt;ref name="Jones4" /&gt; Not every work referring to the "Lucy poems" is intended to mock, however; the novelist and essayist [[Mary Shelley]] (1797–1851) drew upon the poems to comment on and re-imagine the Romantic portrayal of femininity.&lt;ref name="Alexander p. 147"/&gt;

==Settings==
The "Lucy poems" (omitting "I travelled among unknown men" but adding "Among all lovely things") have been set for voice and piano by the composer Nigel Dodd.  The settings were first performed at St George's, Brandon Hill, Bristol, in October 1995 at a concert marking the bicentenary of the first meeting of Wordsworth and Coleridge.&lt;ref&gt;''The Coleridge Bulletin'', New Series 44, Winter 2014, v&lt;/ref&gt;

Among settings of individual poems is [[Benjamin Britten]]'s "Lucy" ("I travelled among unknown men") composed in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brittensongdatabase.com|title=Benjamin Britten (1913-1976) - The Comprehensive Britten Song Database|work=brittensongdatabase.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem was set to music and recorded by the [[orchestral pop]] band [[The Divine Comedy (band)|The Divine Comedy]] on their album [[Liberation (The Divine Comedy album)|Liberation]].

'''Thomas Young''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (13 June 1773&amp;nbsp;– 10 May 1829) was a British [[polymath]] and [[physician]]. Young made notable scientific contributions to the fields of [[Visual perception|vision]], light, [[solid mechanics]], energy, [[physiology]], [[language]], [[harmony|musical harmony]], and [[Egyptology]]. He "made a number of original and insightful innovations"&lt;ref&gt;[[Dictionary of National Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs (specifically the [[Rosetta Stone]]) before [[Jean-François Champollion]] eventually expanded on his work. He was mentioned by, among others, [[William Herschel]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], and [[Albert Einstein]]. Young has been described as "[[The Last Man Who Knew Everything]]".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Biography==
Young belonged to a [[Quaker]] family of [[Milverton, Somerset]], where he was born in 1773, the eldest of ten children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Young|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Young_Thomas.html|publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics  University of St Andrews, Scotland|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of fourteen Young had learned [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] and was acquainted with [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[German language|German]], [[Aramaic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Samaritan language|Samaritan]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Amharic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Singh, Simon | authorlink = Simon Singh | title=[[The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography]] | publisher=Anchor | year=2000 | isbn=0-385-49532-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young began to study medicine in London at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] in 1792, moved to the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]] in 1794, and a year later went to [[Göttingen]], Lower Saxony, Germany, where he obtained the degree of doctor of medicine in 1796 from the [[University of Göttingen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Young (1773-1829)|url=https://www.andrewgasson.co.uk/thomas-young-1773-1829/|publisher=Andrew Gasson|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1797 he entered [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=YN797T|name=Young, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he inherited the estate of his grand-uncle, [[Richard Brocklesby]], which made him financially independent, and in 1799 he established himself as a physician at 48 [[Welbeck Street]], London (now recorded with a [[blue plaque]]). Young published many of his first academic articles anonymously to protect his reputation as a physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Robinson|first=Andrew| authorlink=W. Andrew Robinson | title=[[The Last Man Who Knew Everything]]: Thomas Young, the Anonymous Polymath Who Proved Newton Wrong, Explained How We See, Cured the Sick and Deciphered the Rosetta Stone|date=2006|publisher=[[Oneworld Publications]]|isbn=978-1851684946|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1801, Young was appointed professor of [[natural philosophy]] (mainly [[physics]]) at the [[Royal Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ri Professors|url=http://www.rigb.org/our-history/people/ri-professors|publisher=Royal Institution|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In two years, he delivered 91 lectures. In 1802, he was appointed foreign secretary of the [[Royal Society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THOMAS YOUNG (1773 - 1829)|url=https://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/about/history/famous//index.cfm?id=9|publisher=Emmanuel College|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which he had been elected a fellow in 1794.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portrait of Thomas Young|url=https://pictures.royalsociety.org/image-rs-11916|publisher=Royal Society|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned his professorship in 1803, fearing that its duties would interfere with his medical practice. His lectures were published in 1807 in the ''Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy'' and contain a number of anticipations of later theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morgan|first1=Michael|title=Thomas Young's Lectures on Natural Philosophy and the Mechanical Arts|journal=Perception|date=2002|volume=31|pages=1509–1511|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/p3112rvw|doi=10.1068/p3112rvw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811, Young became physician to [[St George's Hospital]], and in 1814 he served on a committee appointed to consider the dangers involved in the general introduction of [[gas lighting|gas]] for lighting into London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weld|first1=Charles Richard|title=A History of the Royal Society: With Memoirs of the Presidents|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108028189|pages=235-237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fhoeyvuEJI4C&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq=Thomas+Young+gas+lighting&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LbrwKUc2My&amp;sig=ur33m2wSAi7TQtwaFMGZ2qQjWgM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmlNaH2f_VAhXJB8AKHdBrBoUQ6AEISDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Thomas%20Young%20gas%20lighting&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816 he was secretary of a commission charged with ascertaining the precise length of the second's or [[seconds pendulum]] (the length of a pendulum whose period is exactly 2 seconds), and in 1818 he became secretary to the [[Board of Longitude]] and superintendent of the [[HM Nautical Almanac Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Alexander|last2=Oldham|first2=Frank|title=Thomas Young: Natural Philosopher, 1773-1829|date=1954|publisher=CUP Archive|pages=304-308|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hHc6AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA308&amp;lpg=PA308&amp;dq=Thomas+Young+HM+Nautical+Almanac+Office&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VBL9QLjvFT&amp;sig=G_7EIb_G6UdbqDW7L0J_7uveY-Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp0J_R2f_VAhXCDcAKHfnBC0wQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Thomas%20Young%20HM%20Nautical%20Almanac%20Office&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1822.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter Y|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterY.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few years before his death he became interested in [[life insurance]],&lt;ref name="Peacock, George 1855"&gt;{{cite book | title = Life of Thomas Young: M.D., F.R.S., &amp;c.; and One of the Eight Foreign Associates of the National Institute of France | author = Peacock, George | publisher = J.

==Death, legacy and reputation==
Thomas Young died in London on 10 May 1829, and was buried in the cemetery of St. Giles Church in [[Farnborough, London|Farnborough]], Kent, England. [[Westminster Abbey]] houses a white marble tablet in memory of Young bearing an epitaph by [[Hudson Gurney]]:&lt;ref&gt;

Young was highly regarded by his friends and colleagues. He was said never to impose his knowledge, but if asked was able to answer even the most difficult scientific question with ease. Although very learned he had a reputation for sometimes having difficulty in communicating his knowledge. It was said by one of his contemporaries that, "His words were not those in familiar use, and the arrangement of his ideas seldom the same as those he conversed with. He was therefore worse calculated than any man I ever knew for the communication of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;"Peacock's Life of Dr Young" by George Peacock, D.D., F.R.S., etc. Dean of Ely, Lowndean Professor of Astronomy University of Cambridge, etc. quoted in "The Living Age" by E. Littell, Second Series, Volume X, 1855, Littell, Son and Company, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later scholars and scientists have praised Young's work although they may know him only through achievements he made in their fields. His contemporary Sir [[John Herschel]] called him a "truly original genius".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buick|first1=Tony|title=The Rainbow Sky: An Exploration of Colors in the Solar System and Beyond|date=2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781441910530|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKja1yLMLyQC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Thomas+Young+Herschel+truly+original+genius&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VARObe1RoP&amp;sig=PDyOQhChx6Mhme-EeTNwhMuHW_c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAmoVChMI4Nvj4LKzyAIVhHEUCh3XKQN1#v=onepage&amp;q=Thomas%20Young%20Herschel%20truly%20original%20genius&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]] praised him in the 1931 foreword to an edition of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''Opticks''. Other admirers include physicist [[Lord Rayleigh]] and Nobel laureate [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]].

Thomas Young's name has been adopted as the name of the London-based [[Thomas Young Centre]], an alliance of academic research groups engaged in the theory and simulation of materials.

==Research==

===Wave theory of light===
In Young's own judgment, of his many achievements the most important was to establish the [[wave theory of light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Young (1773–1829)|url=http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~jeff/115a/history/young.html|publisher=UC Santa Barbara|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haidar|first1=Riad|title=Thomas Young and the wave theory of light|url=https://www.bibnum.education.fr/sites/default/files/71-young-analysis.pdf|publisher=Bibnum|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, he had to overcome the century-old view, expressed in the venerable Isaac Newton's ''[[Opticks]]'', that light is a particle.  Nevertheless, in the early-19th century Young put forth a number of theoretical reasons supporting the wave theory of light, and he developed two enduring demonstrations to support this viewpoint. With the [[ripple tank]] he demonstrated the idea of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] in the context of water waves. With the [[Young's interference experiment]], or [[double-slit experiment]], he demonstrated interference in the context of light as a wave.

[[File:Young-Thomas-Lectures1807-Plate_XXX.jpg|thumb|right|Plate from "Lectures" of 1802 (RI), pub. 1807]]
"The experiments I am about to relate ... may be repeated with great ease, whenever the sun shines, and without any other apparatus than is at hand to every one",  is how Thomas Young, speaking on 24 November 1803, to the Royal Society of London, began his description of the historic experiment. His talk was published in the following year's ''Philosophical Transactions'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Young| first=Thomas| title=Bakerian Lecture:  Experiments and calculations relative to physical optics|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|year=1804|volume=94|pages = 1–16 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7AZGAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|bibcode = 1804RSPT...94....1Y| doi=10.1098/rstl.1804.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was destined to become a classic, still reprinted and read today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shamos|first=Morris|title=Great Experiments in Physics|year=1959|publisher=Holt Rinehart and Winston|location=New York|pages=96–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the subsequent paper entitled ''Experiments and Calculations Relative to Physical Optics'', published in 1804, Young describes an experiment in which he placed a narrow card (approximately 1/30th inch) in a [[Light beam|beam of light]] from a single opening in a window and observed the fringes of colour in the shadow and to the sides of the card. He observed that placing another card before or after the narrow strip so as to prevent light from the beam from striking one of its edges caused the fringes to disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Magie|first=William Francis|title=A Source Book in Physics|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1935}} p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; This supported the contention that light is composed of [[wave]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Of course, both Young and Newton were eventually shown to be partially correct, as neither wave nor particle explanations alone can explain the behaviour of light. See e.g. http://www.single-molecule.nl/notes/light-waves-and-photons/.&lt;/ref&gt;  Young performed and analysed a number of experiments, including interference of light from reflection off nearby pairs of micrometre grooves, from reflection off thin films of soap and oil, and from [[Newton's rings]]. He also performed two important diffraction experiments using fibres and long narrow strips. In his ''Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy and the Mechanical Arts'' (1807) he gives [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|Grimaldi]] credit for first observing the fringes in the shadow of an object placed in a beam of light. Within ten years, much of Young's work was reproduced and then extended by [[Fresnel]]. ([[Tony Rothman]] in ''Everything's Relative and Other Fables from Science and Technology'' argues that there is no clear evidence that Young actually did the two-slit experiment.  ''See also [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] [[wave–particle duality]]''.)

===Young's modulus===
{{main article|Young's modulus}}
[[File:Young - Mathematical elements of natural philosophy, 2002 - 3933182 F.tif|thumb|Young's ''Mathematical Elements of Natural Philosophy'']]

Young described the characterization of elasticity that came to be known as Young's modulus, denoted as ''E'', in 1807, and further described it in his ''Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy and the Mechanical Arts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy and the Mechanical Arts | author = Young, Thomas | url = https://books.google.com/?id=fGMSAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA106&amp;dq=modulus+inauthor:thomas+inauthor:young | year = 1845 | publisher = London: Taylor and Walton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the first use of the concept of Young's modulus in experiments was by [[Giordano Riccati]] in 1782&amp;nbsp;– predating Young by 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Truesdell, Clifford A.| year = 1960 | title = The Rational Mechanics of Flexible or Elastic Bodies, 1638–1788: Introduction to Leonhardi Euleri Opera Omnia, vol. X and XI, Seriei Secundae | publisher = Orell Fussli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the idea can be traced to a paper by [[Leonhard Euler]] published in 1727, some 80 years before Thomas Young's 1807 paper.

The Young's modulus relates the stress (pressure) in a body to its associated strain (change in length as a ratio of the original length); that is, stress = ''E'' × strain, for a uniaxially loaded specimen. Young's modulus is independent of the component under investigation; that is, it is an inherent material property (the term modulus refers to an inherent material property). Young's Modulus allowed, for the first time, prediction of the strain in a component subject to a known stress (and vice versa). Prior to Young's contribution, engineers were required to apply Hooke's F = kx relationship to identify the deformation (x) of a body subject to a known load (F), where the constant (k) is a function of both the geometry and material under consideration. Finding k required physical testing for any new component, as the F = kx relationship is a function of both geometry and material.  Young's Modulus depends only on the material, not its geometry, thus allowing a revolution in engineering strategies.

Young's problems in sometimes not expressing himself clearly were shown by his own definition of the modulus: "The modulus of the elasticity of any substance is a column of the same substance, capable of producing a pressure on its base which is to the weight causing a certain degree of compression as the length of the substance is to the diminution of its length." When this explanation was put to the Lords of the Admiralty, their clerk wrote to Young saying "Though science is much respected by their Lordships and your paper is much esteemed, it is too learned ... in short it is not understood."&lt;ref&gt;"Structures, or Why Things Don't Fall Down" by J. E. Gordon, Penguin Books, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vision and colour theory===
Young has also been called the founder of physiological optics. In 1793 he explained the mode in which the eye [[accommodation (eye)|accommodates]] itself to vision at different distances as depending on change of the curvature of the [[lens (vision)|crystalline lens]]; in 1801 he was the first to describe [[Astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3I9JAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA23-IA3 | title = On the mechanics of the eye | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society | volume = 91 | year = 1801 | pages = 23 | first = Thomas | last = Young|bibcode = 1801RSPT...91...23Y | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1801.0004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his lectures he presented the hypothesis, afterwards developed by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], (the [[Young–Helmholtz theory]]), that colour perception depends on the presence in the retina of three kinds of nerve fibres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Young, T.|year= 1802|title= Bakerian Lecture: On the Theory of Light and Colours|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.|volume= 92|pages=12–48| doi= 10.1098/rstl.1802.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This foreshadowed the modern understanding of [[colour vision]], in particular the finding that the eye does indeed have three colour receptors which are sensitive to different wavelength ranges.

===Young–Laplace equation===
In 1804, Young developed the theory of capillary phenomena on the principle of [[surface tension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=An Essay on the Cohesion of Fluids|jstor=107159|author=Young, Thomas|journal=Phil. Trans. |year=1805 |page=65|doi=10.1098/rstl.1805.0005|url=https://archive.org/details/philtrans01794383 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also observed the constancy of the angle of contact of a liquid surface with a solid, and showed how from these two principles to deduce the phenomena of capillary action. In 1805, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], the French philosopher, discovered the significance of meniscus radii with respect to capillary action.

In 1830, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], the German mathematician, unified the work of these two scientists to derive the [[Young–Laplace equation]], the formula that describes the [[capillary pressure]] difference sustained across the interface between two static fluids.

Young was the first to define the term "energy" in the modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Ueber den Ausgangswerth der kleinsten Absweichungssumme | author = Fechner, Gustav Theodor | year = 1878 | publisher = S. Hirzel | url = https://books.google.com/?id=qY8KAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Young's equation and Young–Dupré equation===
{{details|Wetting}}
Young's equation describes the [[contact angle]] of a liquid drop on a plane solid surface as a function of the surface free energy, the interfacial free energy and the surface tension of the liquid. Young's equation was developed further some 60 years later by Dupré to account for thermodynamic effects, and this is known as the Young–Dupré equation.

===Medicine===
In physiology Young made an important contribution to [[haemodynamics]] in the Croonian lecture for 1808 on the "Functions of the Heart and Arteries," where he derived a formula for the wave speed of the pulse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Thomas Young's research on fluid transients: 200 years on | author = Tijsseling, A.S., Anderson, A. | journal = Proc. of the 10th Int. Conf. on Pressure Surges (Editor S. Hunt), Edinburgh, United Kingdom, pp. 21–33. | year = 2008 | publisher = BHR Group | isbn = 978-1-85598-095-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his medical writings included ''An Introduction to Medical Literature'', including a ''System of Practical Nosology'' (1813) and ''A Practical and Historical Treatise on Consumptive Diseases'' (1815).

Young devised a rule of thumb for determining a child's drug dosage. Young's Rule states that the child dosage is equal to the adult dosage multiplied by the child's age in years, divided by the sum of 12 plus the child's age.

===Languages===
In an appendix to his 1796 Göttingen dissertation ''De corporis hvmani viribvs conservatricibvs'' there are four pages added proposing a universal phonetic alphabet (so as 'not to leave these pages blank'; lit.: "Ne vacuae starent hae paginae, libuit e praelectione ante disputationem habenda tabellam literarum vniuersalem raptim describere"). It includes 16 "pure" vowel symbols, nasal vowels, various consonants, and examples of these, drawn primarily from French and English.

In his ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' article "Languages", Young compared the grammar and vocabulary of 400 languages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | author=Robinson, Andrew | title=The Last Man Who Knew Everything: Thomas Young, the Anonymous Genius who Proved Newton Wrong and Deciphered the Rosetta Stone, among Other Surprising Feats | publisher=Penguin | year=2007 | isbn=0-13-134304-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate work in 1813, he introduced the term [[Indo-European languages]], 165 years after the Dutch linguist and scholar [[Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn]] proposed the grouping to which this term refers in 1647.

===Egyptian hieroglyphs===
{{main article|Decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs}}
Young made significant contribution in the [[decipher]]ment of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. He started his Egyptology work rather late, in 1813, when the work was already in progress among other researchers.

He began by using an [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Egyptian demotic]] alphabet of 29 letters built up by [[Johan David Åkerblad]] in 1802 (14 turned out to be incorrect). Åkerblad was correct in stressing the importance of the demotic text in trying to read the inscriptions, but he wrongly believed that demotic was entirely alphabetic.&lt;ref&gt;E.A.W. Budge, [1893], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/egy/trs/trs04.htm ''The Rosetta Stone.''] www.sacred-texts.com p132&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1814 Young had completely translated the "enchorial" text of the [[Rosetta Stone]] (using a list with 86 demotic words), and then studied the [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphic alphabet]] but initially failed to recognise that the demotic and hieroglyphic texts were paraphrases and not simple translations.&lt;ref&gt;Young's first publications are as follows: "Letter to the Rev. S. Weston respecting some Egyptian Antiquities". With four copper plates [published under the name of his friend William Rouse Boughton, but written by Young], ''Archeologia Britannica''. London, 1814. Vol. XVIII. P. 59-72; [Anonymous publication], Museum Criticum of Cambridge, Pt. VI., 1815 (this includes the correspondence which took place between Young, [[Silvestre de Sacy]] and Akerblad)&lt;/ref&gt;

There was considerable rivalry between Young and [[Jean-François Champollion]] while both were working on hieroglyphic decipherment. At first they briefly cooperated in their work, but later, from around 1815, a chill arose between them. For many years they kept details of their work away from each other.

Some of Young's conclusions appeared in the famous article "Egypt" he wrote for the 1818 edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.

When Champollion finally published a translation of the hieroglyphs and the key to the grammatical system in 1822, Young (and many others) praised his work. Nevertheless, a year later Young published an ''Account of the Recent Discoveries in Hieroglyphic Literature and Egyptian Antiquities'', to have his own work recognised as the basis for Champollion's system.

Young had correctly found the sound value of six hieroglyphic signs, but had not deduced the grammar of the language. Young himself acknowledged that he was somewhat at a disadvantage because Champollion's knowledge of the relevant languages, such as Coptic, was much greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Simon|title=The Decipherment of Hieroglyphs|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/decipherment_01.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several scholars have suggested that Young's true contribution to Egyptology was his decipherment of the demotic script. He made the first major advances in this area; he also correctly identified demotic as being composed by both ideographic and phonetic signs.{{sfn|Adkins|Adkins|2000|p=277}}

Subsequently, Young felt that Champollion was unwilling to share the credit for the decipherment. In the ensuing controversy, strongly motivated by the political tensions of that time, the British tended to champion Young, while the French mostly championed Champollion. Champollion did acknowledge some of Young's contribution, but rather sparingly. However, after 1826, when Champollion was a curator in the [[Louvre]], he did offer Young access to demotic manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean-François Champollion|url=http://greathistorians.com/en/jean-francois-champollion|publisher=Great Historians|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, while [[Sir George Cornewall Lewis, 2nd Baronet|Sir George Lewis]] still doubted Champollion's achievement as late as 1862, others were more accepting. For example, [[Reginald Stuart Poole|Reginald Poole]], and Sir [[Peter Le Page Renouf]] both defended Champollion.{{sfn|Thomasson|2013}}

===Music===
He developed [[Young temperament]], a method of tuning musical instruments.

=== Religious views ===
Though he sometimes dealt with religious topics of history in Egypt and wrote about the history of Christianity in [[Nubia]], not much is known about Young's personal religious views.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Wood (physicist)|Wood, Alexander]]. 2011. ''Thomas Young: Natural Philosopher 1773–1829''. Cambridge University Press.  p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; On [[George Peacock]]'s account, Young never spoke to him about morals, metaphysics or religion, though according to Young's wife, his attitudes showed that "his Quaker upbringing had strongly influenced his religious practices."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Wood (physicist)|Wood, Alexander]]. 2011. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jw9nLFVjXdEC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Thomas Young: Natural Philosopher 1773–1829]''. Cambridge University Press. p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Authority sources have described Young in terms of a cultural Christian Quaker.&lt;ref&gt;Peacock &amp; Leitch., ''[https://archive.org/details/miscellaneouswo00youngoog Miscellaneous works of the late Thomas Young]'' (1855), London, J. Murray, p. 516: "he was pre-eminently entitled to the high distinction of a Christian, patriot, and philosopher."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Wood (physicist)|Wood, Alexander]]. 2011. ''Thomas Young: Natural Philosopher 1773–1829''. Cambridge University Press.  p. XVI&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hudson Gurney]] informed that before his marriage, Young had to join the [[Church of England]], and was baptized later. After his work on physics received some criticism from [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]], Young stated: "I have resolved to confine my studies and my pen to medical subjects only. For the talents which God has not given me, I am not responsible, but those which I possess, I have hitherto cultivated and employed as diligently as my opportunities have allowed me to do ; and I shall continue to apply them with assiduity, and in tranquillity, to that profession which has constantly been the ultimate object of all my labours.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Wood (physicist)|Wood, Alexander]]. 2011. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jw9nLFVjXdEC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Thomas Young: Natural Philosopher 1773–1829]''. Cambridge University Press. p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Gurney stated that Young "retained a good deal of his old creed, and carried to his scriptural studies his habit of inquisition of languages and manners," rather than the habit of proselytism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Wood (physicist)|Wood, Alexander]]. 2011, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the day before his death, Young participated in religious sacraments; as reported in [[David Brewster]]'s ''Edinburgh Journal of Science'': "After some information concerning his affairs, and some instructions concerning the hierographical papers in his hands, he said that, perfectly aware of his situation, he had taken the sacraments of the church on the day preceding... His religious sentiments were by himself stated to be liberal, though orthodox. He had extensively studied [[The Bible|the Scriptures]], of which the precepts were deeply impressed upon his mind from his earliest years; and he evidenced the faith which he professed; in an unbending course of usefulness and rectitude."&lt;ref&gt;Brewster, David. 1831. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=P_hSAAAAcAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Edinburgh Journal of Science]''. Vol. 8, Blackwood. pp. 204;207&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas de Ros or Roos, 8th Baron de Ros of Helmsley''' (26 September 1406 – 18 August 1430) was an English [[peerage|peer]].

==Family==
Thomas de Ros, born 26 September 1406, was the second son of [[William de Ros, 6th Baron de Ros]], and Margaret Fitzalan (d. 3 July 1438), the daughter of [[John FitzAlan, 1st Baron Arundel]], by [[Eleanor Maltravers, 2nd Baroness Maltravers|Eleanor Maltravers]] (c.1345 – 12 January 1405), younger daughter and coheir of [[Baron Maltravers|Sir John Maltravers]] (d. 22 January 1349).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1949|pp=102–3}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson I|2011|pp=29–30}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|pp=455–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Thomas de Ros was a younger brother of [[John de Ros, 7th Baron de Ros]], who died childless at the [[Battle of Baugé]] on 22 March 1421. Thomas inherited his rank and privileges, and followed the example of his brother in participating in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. He fought in the [[Battle of Verneuil]] under the command of [[John, Duke of Bedford]]. He was honored for his efforts, knighted by [[Henry VI of England]] on 19 May 1426. Henry was nephew of the Duke. Thomas resumed service under the Duke in 1427. He was summoned to the [[List of Parliaments of England|Parliament of England]] in 1429. In 1430 he fell into the [[Seine]] during a minor [[skirmish]] and was drowned.

==Marriage and issue==
Thomas de Ros married [[Eleanor Beauchamp]], daughter of [[Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick]], and his first wife, Elizabeth Berkeley, by whom he had two sons and a daughter:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1949|pp=104–5}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|pp=457–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Thomas de Ros, 9th Baron de Ros]] (9 September 1427 – 17 May 1464).
*Richard de Ros, esquire, who married, before 1468, Jane or Joan Knyvet, daughter of Sir John Knyvet.
*Margaret de Ros, who married firstly [[William de Botreaux, 3rd Baron Botreaux]], and secondly [[Thomas Burgh of Gainsborough|Thomas Burgh, 1st Baron Burgh of Gainsborough]].

After the death of Thomas de Ros, his widow, Eleanor, married secondly, [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset]], and thirdly, Walter Rokesley, esquire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1949|pp=104–5}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=457}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Timeline of longest spaceflights''' is a chronology of the longest spaceflights. Many of the first flights set records measured in hours and days, the space station missions of the 1970s and 1980s pushed this to weeks and months, and by the 1990s the record was pushed to over a year and has remained there into the 21st century.

A modern long-duration mission is the [[ISS year long mission]] (2015–2016) aboard the International Space Station. The most significant issue in such missions is the [[effects of spaceflight on the human body]], due to such factors as zero-g and elevated radiation.

'''Anthony  Ulysses "Tony" Thompson, Jr.''' (September 2, 1975 – June 1, 2007) was an American singer–songwriter. Thompson was best known as the lead vocalist of the American R&amp;B quintet [[Hi-Five]], which had hit singles such as "[[I Like the Way (The Kissing Game)]]" and "[[I Can't Wait Another Minute]]". After the group disbanded in 1994, Thompson found solo success the following year with his debut album ''[[Sexsational (Tony Thompson album)|Sexsational]]'' in 1995. After leaving Giant Records,  Thompson was signed to Bad Boy Records; however, he never was able to release an album under them due to his struggles with drug abuse. In later years, Thompson formed his own record label and released an album with the newly formed Hi-Five group in 2005. He died on June 1, 2007 in [[Waco, Texas]] at age 31.

==Biography==
Thompson was born in [[Waco, Texas]] and raised in [[Oklahoma City]]. He was named after his father, Anthony Thompson, Sr. 

In 1984, he started singing solos in the local church choir at the age of eight. He then started singing in local talent shows. Local talent and up-and-coming artist William Walton reached out to Thompson in hopes of making his music dreams a reality. He was noticed by the first R&amp;B group signed by [[Jive Records]], which consisted of Toriano Easley (who is the only native of [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]] and was later replaced by Treston Irby), Marcus Sanders, Russell Neal, and Roderick "Pooh" Clark who were also from [[Waco]]. Taking the name [[Hi-Five]], the group signed with Jive Records in 1990. The quintet's self-titled debut album went platinum and produced several hits, including "[[I Like the Way (The Kissing Game)]]", "[[I Can't Wait Another Minute]]", and "Just Another Girlfriend".&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p26514|pure_url=yes}}  Allmusic.com "Hi-Five]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the group released their second album, ''[[Keep It Goin' On]]'', with "[[She's Playing Hard to Get]]" and "Quality Time". Their third album, ''[[Faithful (Hi-Five album)|Faithful]]'', was released in 1993.

==Solo album and reunion==
Thompson's only solo album, ''[[Sexsational (Tony Thompson album)|Sexsational]]'', was released on [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] in 1995. Thompson formed his own record label, N'Depth, and re-incarnated Hi-Five with four new members. The group's next album, ''[[The Return (Hi-Five album)|The Return]]'' was released in 2005.&lt;ref name="concepcion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1051748/hi-fives-tony-thompson-dies-at-31|title=Hi-Five's Tony Thompson Dies At 31|last=Concepcion|first=Mariel|date=June 4, 2007|publisher=billboard.com|accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On June 1, 2007, Thompson's body was discovered by security officers at around 10 p.m. near an air-conditioning unit outside of an apartment complex in his native Waco, Texas.&lt;ref name="concepcion"/&gt; An autopsy later determined that he had died from "toxic effects of [[chlorodifluoromethane]]," or inhaling a toxic amount of [[freon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasblack.com/entertainment/autopsyresultstonythompson|title=Autopsy Results Are In For Hi-Five Star Tony Thompson|date=July 2, 2007|publisher=dallasblack.com|accessdate=July 4, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707072705/http://www.dallasblack.com/entertainment/autopsyresultstonythompson|archivedate=July 7, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried at Doris Miller Memorial Park in Waco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wacotrib.com/news/family-and-friends-remember-waco-singer-tony-thompson-at-headstone/article_f2c8ea0c-2a8a-50fd-b338-56aa6a90c743.html?TNNoMobile|title=Family and friends remember Waco singer Tony Thompson at headstone ceremony|last=Hoover|first=Carl|date=June 5, 2010|publisher=wacotrib.com|accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines running to the right are the tapes of genetic instructions, which are copied along with the body of the machines. The machine shown runs in a 32-state version of von Neumann's cellular automata environment, not his original 29-state specification.]]

[[John von Neumann]]'s '''universal constructor''' is a [[self-replicating machine]] in a [[cellular automata]] (CA) environment. It was designed in the 1940s, without the use of a computer. The fundamental details of the machine were published in von Neumann's book ''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata'', completed in 1966 by [[Arthur Burks|Arthur W. Burks]] after von Neumann's death.&lt;ref name=TSRA&gt;{{Citation| url=https://archive.org/details/theoryofselfrepr00vonn_0| title=''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata.''| author1=von Neumann, John| author2=Burks, Arthur W.| year=1966| publisher=University of Illinois Press| format=Scanned book online| archivedate=2015-06-24| accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Neumann's goal was to specify an abstract machine which, when run, would replicate itself. In his design, the machine consists of three parts: a 'blueprint' for itself, a mechanism that can read any blueprint and construct the machine (sans blueprint) specified by that blueprint, and a 'copy machine' that can make copies of any blueprint. After the mechanism has been used to construct the machine specified by the blueprint, the copy machine is used to create a copy of that blueprint, and this copy is placed into the new machine, resulting in a working replication of the original machine. Some machines will do this backwards, copying the blueprint and then building a machine.

To define his machine in more detail, von Neumann invented the concept of a cellular automaton. The [[Von Neumann cellular automaton|one he used]] consists of a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can be in one of 29 states at any point in time. At each timestep, each cell updates its state depending on the states of the surrounding cells at the prior timestep. The rules governing these updates are identical for all cells. 

The universal constructor is a certain pattern of cell states in this cellular automaton. It contains one line of cells that serve as a 'tape', encoding a sequence of instructions that serve as a 'blueprint' for the machine. The machine reads these instructions one by one and performs the corresponding actions. The instructions direct the machine to use its 'construction arm' to build a copy of the machine, without tape, at some other location in the cell grid. The tape can't contain instructions to build an equally long tape, just as a container can't contain a container of the same size. Therefore, the machine contains a separate 'copy machine' which reads the tape and places a copy into the newly constructed machine. The resulting new machine and tape is identical to the old one, and it proceeds to replicate again.

== Purpose ==

Von Neumann's design has traditionally been understood to be a demonstration of the logical requirements for machine self-replication.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000&gt;{{Citation|journal=Artificial Life|last=McMullin|first=B.|year=2000|title=John von Neumann and the Evolutionary Growth of Complexity: Looking Backwards, Looking Forwards...|volume=6|issue=4|pages=347–361|url=http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~alife/bmcm-alj-2000/|doi=10.1162/106454600300103674|pmid=11348586}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is clear that far simpler machines can achieve self-replication. Examples include trivial [[Crystal growth|crystal-like growth]], [[template replication]], and [[Langton's loops]]. But von Neumann was interested in something more profound: construction, universality, and evolution.&lt;ref name="walenz.org"&gt;[http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/page0110.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613231149/http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/page0110.html |date=June 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This universal constructor can be seen as an abstract [[simulation]] of a physical [[universal assembler]].

Note that the simpler self-replicating CA structures (especially, [[Byl's loop]] and the [[Chou–Reggia loop]]) cannot exist in a wide variety of forms and thus have very limited [[evolvability]]. Other CA structures such as the [[Evoloop]] are somewhat evolvable but still don't support open-ended evolution. Commonly, simple replicators do not fully contain the machinery of construction, there being a degree to which the replicator is information copied by its surrounding environment. Although the Von Neumann design is a logical construction, it is in principle a design that could be instantiated as a physical machine. The issue of the environmental contribution to replication is somewhat open, since there are different conceptions of raw material and its availability.

The concept of a ''universal constructor'' is non-trivial because of the existence of [[Garden of Eden (cellular automaton)|Garden of Eden patterns]]. But a simple definition is that a universal constructor is able to construct any finite pattern of non-excited (quiescent) cells.

Von Neumann's crucial insight is that part of the replicator has a double use; being both an active component of the construction mechanism, and being the target of a passive copying process. This part is played by the tape of instructions in Von Neumann's combination of universal constructor plus instruction tape.

The combination of a universal constructor and a tape of instructions would i) allow self-replication, and also ii) guarantee that the open-ended complexity growth observed in biological organisms was possible.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000/&gt; The image below illustrates this possibility.

This insight is all the more remarkable because it preceded the discovery of the structure of the DNA molecule by [[James Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]], though it followed the [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment]] which identified [[DNA]] as the molecular carrier of genetic information in living organisms.&lt;ref name=Rocha_lec_notes&gt;{{citation |last=Rocha|first=Luis M.|title=Lecture Notes of I-585-Biologically Inspired Computing Course, Indiana University|contribution=Von Neumann and Natural Selection.|url=http://informatics.indiana.edu/rocha/i-bic/pdfs/ibic_lecnotes_c6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA molecule is processed by separate mechanisms that carry out its instructions and copy the DNA for insertion for the newly constructed cell. The ability to achieve open-ended evolution lies in the fact that, just as in nature, errors ([[mutations]]) in the copying of the genetic tape can lead to viable variants of the automaton, which can then evolve via [[Natural Selection|natural selection]].

[[Image:Pesavento replicator inherited mutations.png|thumb|center|700px|A demonstration of the ability of von Neumann's machine to support inheritable mutations. (1) At an earlier timestep, a mutation was manually added to the second generation machine's tape. (2) Later generations both display the [[phenotype]] of the mutation (a drawing of a flower) and pass the mutation on to their children, since the tape is copied each time. This example illustrates how von Neumann's design allows for complexity growth (in theory) since the tape could specify a machine that is more complex than the one making it.]]

== Implementations ==

[[Arthur Burks]] and others extended the work of von Neumann, giving a much clearer and complete set of details regarding the design and operation of von Neumann's self-replicator. The work of J. W. Thatcher is particularly noteworthy, for he greatly simplified the design. Still, their work did not yield a complete design, cell by cell, of a configuration capable of demonstrating self-replication.

[[Renato Nobili]] and Umberto Pesavento published the first fully implemented self-reproducing cellular automaton in 1995, nearly fifty years after von Neumann's work.&lt;ref name=Pesavento1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=NobiliPesavento1996&gt;{{Citation|last=Nobili|first=Renato|last2=Pesavento|first2=Umberto|contribution=Generalised von Neumann's Automata|title=Proc. Artificial Worlds and Urban Studies, Conference 1|year=1996|editor-last=Besussi|editor-first=E.|editor2-last=Cecchini|editor2-first=A.|location=Venice|publisher=DAEST|url=http://www.pd.infn.it/%7Ernobili/pdf_files/jvnconstr.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used a 32-state cellular automaton instead of von Neumann's original [[Von Neumann cellular automaton|29-state specification]], extending it to allow for easier signal-crossing, explicit memory function and a more compact design. They also published an implementation of a general constructor within the original 29-state CA but not one capable of complete replication - the configuration cannot duplicate its tape, nor can it trigger its offspring; the configuration can only construct.&lt;ref name=NobiliPesavento1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=Automata2008/&gt;

In 2004, D. Mange et al. reported an implementation of a self-replicator that is consistent with the designs of von Neumann.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE| title=A Macroscopic View of Self-replication| volume=92| issue=12| first=Daniel| last=Mange|last2=Stauffer|first2=A.|last3=Peparaolo|first3=L.|last4=Tempesti|first4=G.| pages=1929–1945| year=2004|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2004.837631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Nobili published a 32-state implementation that uses [[run-length encoding]] to greatly reduce the size of the tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pd.infn.it/~rnobili/wjvn/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129003524/http://www.pd.infn.it/~rnobili/wjvn/index.htm |archivedate=January 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, William R. Buckley published two configurations which are self-replicators within the original 29-state CA of von Neumann.&lt;ref name=Automata2008&gt;{{Citation|title=Proc. Automata 2008|contribution=Signal Crossing Solutions in von Neumann Self-replicating Cellular Automata| year=2008| first=William R.| last=Buckley|editor=[[Andrew Adamatzky]] |editor2=Ramon Alonso-Sanz |editor3=Anna Lawniczak |editor4=Genaro Juarez Martinez |editor5=Kenichi Morita |editor6=Thomas Worsch |pages=453–503|publisher=Luniver Press|url=http://uncomp.uwe.ac.uk/free-books/automata2008reducedsize.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckley claims that the crossing of signal within von Neumann 29-state cellular automata is not necessary to the construction of self-replicators.&lt;ref name=Automata2008/&gt; Buckley also points out that for the purposes of evolution, each replicator should return to its original configuration after replicating, in order to be capable (in theory) of making more than one copy. As published, the 1995 design of Nobili-Pesavento does not fulfill this requirement but the 2007 design of Nobili does; the same is true of Buckley's configurations.

In 2009, Buckley published with [[Golly (program)|Golly]] a third configuration for von Neumann 29-state cellular automata, which can perform either holistic self-replication, or self-replication by partial construction.  This configuration also demonstrates that signal crossing is not necessary to the construction of self-replicators within von Neumann 29-state cellular automata.

C. L. Nehaniv in 2002, and also Y. Takada et al. in 2004, proposed a universal constructor directly implemented upon an asynchronous cellular automaton, rather than upon a synchronous cellular automaton.

As defined by von Neumann, universal construction entails the construction of passive configurations, only. As such, the concept of universal construction constituted nothing more than a literary (or, in this case, mathematical) device. It facilitated other proof, such as that a machine well constructed may engage in self-replication, while universal construction itself was simply assumed over a most minimal case. Universal construction under this standard is trivial. Hence, while all the configurations given here can construct any passive configuration, none can construct the real-time crossing organ devised by Gorman.&lt;ref name="Automata2008"/&gt;

== Practicality ==

=== Computational cost ===

All the implementations of von Neumann's self-reproducing machine require considerable resources to run on computer. For example, in the Nobili-Pesavento 32-state implementation shown above, while the body of the machine is just 6,329 non-empty cells (within a rectangle of size 97x170), it requires a tape that is 145,315 cells long, and takes 63 billion timesteps to replicate. A simulator running at 1,000 timesteps per second would take over 2 years to make the first copy. In 1995, when the first implementation was published, the authors had not seen their own machine replicate. However, in 2008, the [[hashlife]] algorithm was extended to support the 29-state and 32-state rulesets in [[Golly (program)|Golly]]. On a modern desktop PC, replication now takes only a few minutes, although a significant amount of memory is required.

=== Evolvability ===

It has been argued that the problem Von Neumann was trying to address was not self-reproduction ''per se'', but the evolutionary growth of complexity.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000/&gt; His “proof-of-principle” designs showed how it is logically possible, by using a general purpose programmable (“universal”) constructor, to exhibit an indefinitely large class of self-reproducing machines, spanning a wide range of “complexity” (in von Neumann's sense of “the ability to do complicated things”), interconnected by a network of potential mutational pathways, including pathways from the most simple to the most complex. This is an important result, as prior to that it might have been conjectured that there is a fundamental logical barrier to the existence of such pathways; in which case, biological organisms, which do support such pathways, could not be “machines”, as conventionally understood. But the result does not show what ''other'' conditions are necessary, in practice, for evolution along such pathways from simple to complex to be spontaneously realised or followed. In his unfinished work he briefly considers conflict and interactions between his self-reproducing machines;&lt;ref name="TSRA"/&gt;{{rp|147}} but in practice, his particular model cannot yield evolutionary dynamics because the machines are too fragile - the vast majority of perturbations cause them effectively to disintegrate.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9781">'''Abu Zakariyya Yahya ibn Umar ibn Talagagin ibn Turgut ibn Wartasin''', commonly suffixed '''al-Lamtuni''' '''al-Sanhaji''', (d. near [[Azougui|Azuggi]], 1056) was a chieftain of the [[Lamtuna]], a tribe in the [[Sanhaja]] confederation. Yahya ibn Umar was the first emir of the [[Almoravid]]s in the mid-11th century, a movement he constructed in collaboration with the religious leader [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]]. Yahya led the Almoravid armies in their first campaigns, including captures of [[Sijilmassa]] and [[Awdaghost]] in 1054/55, but was himself killed in battle against a dissident Berber faction in the [[Adrar Plateau|Adrar]]. Yahya was succeeded as Almoravid emir by his brother, [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]].

== Background ==

In the 11th century, the [[Sanhaja]] were divided into several tribes - the [[Lamtuna]], the Massufa, the Banu Warith and the [[Godala|Gudala]] (or Judala). After their conversion to Islam during the 9th, the [[Sanhaja]] desert tribes were united and, with the zeal of neophyte converts, launched a series of campaigns against the "[[Sudan (region)|Sudan]]ese" (pagan black peoples of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lewicki (1988:p.160-61; 1992: p.308-09)&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanhaja union carved out a vast Saharan desert empire. After the Sanhaja union collapsed, most of their old dominions - particularly the citadels, caravan stops and oases on the lucrative [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes - were lost to the [[Ghana Empire]] to the south, and to the [[Zenata]] [[Maghrawa]] rulers of [[Sijilmassa]] to the north.

The chronicles trace Yahya's lineage back to the Lamtuna chieftain Turgut ibn Wartasin (by full patronymic record, Yahya ibn Umar ibn Ibrahim (alias Talagagin) ibn Turgut ibn Wartasin al-Lamtuni &lt;ref&gt;See N. Levtzion and J.F.P. Hopkins, 2000, editors, Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History, University of Ghana, p.409.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like many of the leading Lamtuna chieftains, Yahya ibn Umar longed to recreate the old Sanhaja union and recover their lost dominions.

The opportunity seemed to arise in the late 1040s, after the death of [[Yahya ibn Ibrahim]], the chieftain of the neighboring [[Godala|Godala tribe]], and high chief of the Sanhaja confederation.  The desert Sanhaja had [[matrilineal]] succession rules, and Yahya ibn Umar's mother was a [[Godala]] princess. Although only one of several candidates, Yahya ibn Umar succeeded in being elected the new high [[Sanhaja]] chief, a selection which provoked the resentment of the Godala, who had hoped for one of their own.

Ibn Umar's succession was endorsed by [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]], a [[Maliki]] jurist and fiery puritan preacher, who had been staying as a guest of the Gudala, and it is possibly on account of this that Ibn Yasin was expelled by the Gudala.&lt;ref&gt;Messier (2010:p.10)&lt;/ref&gt; Probably sensing the useful organizing power of Ibn Yasin's pious fervor, Yahya ibn Umar invited him to stay among the Lamtuna. Yahya attached himself closely to Ibn Yasin, and a productive relationship was forged between the two men.

Invoking stories of the early life of the Prophet Muhammad, Ibn Yasin preached that conquest was a necessary addendum to Islamicization, that it was not enough to merely adhere to God's law, but necessary to also destroy opposition to it.  And tribalism, Ibn Yasin declared, was against God's law.  Therefore, it is the religious duty of Muslims to set aside their tribal differences, and establish a new polity under the [[Islamic law|Sacred Law]]. For Yahya ibn Umar and the Lamtuna chieftains, Ibn Yasin's ideology dovetailed into their long desire to recreate their old Saharan empire, giving their worldly ambitions the legitimacy of Islamic authority and religious imperative.

== Almoravid emir ==

Ibn Yasin and Yahya collaborated in the leadership of this new movement - soon to be called "the [[Almoravids]]". Abdallah ibn Yasin was the religious imam and ideological leader of the movement,  Yahya ibn Umar the overall military commander, and thus the first Almoravid emir.  Chronicler [[Qadi Ayyad]]  claims that Yahya ibn Umar was the first to use the title ''amir al-muslimin'' ("Prince of the Muslims"), that would thereafter be used by Almoravid rulers.&lt;ref&gt;See translation of al-Qadi Iyad (Ch. 26 of Levtzion and Hopkins, 2000, p.102)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fired up by religious fervor, in the early 1050s, the Lamtuna launched a series of campaigns against the neighboring tribes to persuade them - by force if need be - to join the new Sanhaja union. Under Yahya's leadership, the Lamtuna armies successfully brought the other Sanhaja desert tribes - the Massufa, the Banu Warith and even the wary Gudala - over to the new "cause". Once united, the Almoravids set about seizing the old trans-Saharan routes and stations.  But their rivals were not about to cede control so readily.  The [[Zenata]] [[Maghrawa]] rulers of [[Sijilmassa]] pulled on their connections and clients in the desert to spoil the Almoravid efforts to unite the Sanhaja. After various entanglements with client armies, Yahya soon determined that the best strategy was to strike the troublemaker behind the troublemakers.  In 1054 (or 1055), Yahya led his desert Sanhaja armies against Sijilmassa, defeated the Maghrawa lord and captured the city. The fall of opulent and powerful Sijilmassa to a makeshift army of rustic desert puritans was unexpected and shocked many contemporaries.

With Sijilmassa apparently under control, Yahya turned his army south and headed against the [[Ghana empire]]. The Almoravids seized the critical citadel of [[Awdaghost]] on the southern end of the trans-Saharan route. But news soon arrived that the Zenata had recovered Sijilmassa and expelled the Almoravid garrison. Yahya determined on a forced march back north to recover the city, but the Godala suddenly decided to call it quits, and broke away from the Almoravid coalition. This presented Yahya with the troubling prospect of a hostile force to his rear if he pressed on north.  In a fateful decision, the Almoravids decided to partition their forces - Yahya would lead a campaign against the lands of the Gudala (littoral [[Mauritania]]) and drag them back by force into the union, while instructing his brother Abu Bakr to take a holding force north and keep the Zenata of Sijilmassa in check.

== Battle of Tabfarilla ==

Yahya headed as far as the Almoravid frontier fortress of [[Azougui|Azuggi]], in the [[Adrar Plateau]] of central Mauritania. Feeling he had insufficient forces to take on the Godala by himself, Yahya called upon his new ally, the king [[War Jabi]] of [[Takrur]] for assistance (Takrur, a black African kingdom on the [[Senegal River]], had entered into alliance with the Almoravids during the attack on Ghana).&lt;ref&gt;Levtzion, 1973: p.44&lt;/ref&gt; War Jabi dispatched a large Takruri force under his own son, Labi, to join up with Yahya in the Adrar. But the Gudala struck first. Before the Takruri force managed to reach him, the Godala army bore down on Azuggi, trapping Yahya's smaller force and forcing a pitched battle. The Godala destroyed the Almoravid army at the [[Battle of Tabfarilla]] in March–April 1056. Yahya ibn Umar was killed in the field of battle.

== Aftermath ==

Yahya's brief career as the first Almoravid emir came to a premature end. After his death, Abdallah ibn Yasin immediately appointed Yahya's brother, [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], to succeed him as the new Almoravid emir. Under Abu Bakr's leadership, the Almoravids would re-conquer Sijilmassa, and go on to a spectacular career, conquering most of the rest of [[Morocco]] in the 1070s and eventually come back down to finish off what remained of [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]] in the 1080s.

Chroniclers report that Yahya ibn Umar had three sons - Muhammad, Ali and Isa. Their exact fate is unknown, but it seems their uncle, Abu Bakr ibn Umar, did not forget them.  Around 1057, not long after recovering the city, Abu Bakr appointed his nephew Ali ibn Yahya as the Almoravid governor of the Sijilmassa, a post he seems to have held down to 1069.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Idhari]] asserts Abu Bakr appointed his own son, Ibrahim ibn Abi Bakr, as governor of Sijilmassa.  But [[Ibn al-Athir]] asserts it was a nephew, which numismatic evidence suggests was Ali ibn Yahya, the third son of the first Almoravid commander, Yahya ibn Umar. It is unlikely Abu Bakr would have ignored the sons of his late elder brother.  So they probably both held it in sequence - first, Ali ibn Yahya from c. 1057 until 1069, then Ibrahim ibn Abi Bakr from 1069 to c. 1075 (as confirmed by coinage).See Messier (2001, p.64-65)&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon his death in 1087, Abu Bakr partitioned his dominions (covering the southern half of the Almoravid empire) not only among his own sons, but also among the sons of Yahya.&lt;ref&gt;Levtzion, 1973: p.46&lt;/ref&gt;
