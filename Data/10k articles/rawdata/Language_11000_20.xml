He was known for his writing in, and his work in promoting, the [[Yoruba language]].&lt;ref name =blazing&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=bG77sRtJt4cC&amp;pg=PP21&amp;lpg=PP21&amp;dq=akinwumi+isola+translator+english+yoruba&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p8iadLa3nn&amp;sig=0Q98glxXzRYeD5_XiGqkkqvk31g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fpDMVOVozuOwBPibgIAP&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwCTgK|title=Blazing the Path: Fifty Years of Things Fall Apart|author=Chima Anyadike|author2=Kehinde Ayoola|isbn=978-9-78-081-18-46|publisher=African books Collective|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
He was born in [[Ibadan]] in 1939,  attended Labode Methodist School and [[Wesley College Ibadan|Wesley College]]. He studied at the [[University of Ibadan]], earning a B.A. in French. He earned an M.A. in Yoruba literature from the [[University of Lagos]] in 1978 before commencing academic work as a lecturer at [[Obafemi Awolowo University]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

He was appointed Professor at the same University in 1991. Isola wrote his first play, ''[[Efunsetan Aniwura]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punchng.com/feature/life-times/i-misrepresented-efunsetan-aniwura-in-my-book-prof-akinwumi-isola|title=I misrepresented Efunsetan Aniwura in my book|publisher=The Punch|accessdate=6 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808044024/http://www.punchng.com/feature/life-times/i-misrepresented-efunsetan-aniwura-in-my-book-prof-akinwumi-isola|archivedate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; during 1961-62 while still a student at the [[University of Ibadan]]. This was followed by a novel, ''[[O Leku]]''. In 1986, he wrote and composed the [[Wesley College Ibadan#College Anthem|college anthem]] that is currently being sung in [[Wesley College Ibadan]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

He went on to write a number of plays and novels. He broke into broadcasting, creating a production company that has turned a number of his plays into television dramas and films. Though he claims that "my target audience are Yorubas", Isola has also written in [[English language|English]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=HoP6dxyWPvAC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;lpg=PA217&amp;dq=akinwumi+isola+translator+english+yoruba&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kIXXMRiC-q&amp;sig=DeTJU0sp2-Fp0BhD3D6nTz7p12A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fpDMVOVozuOwBPibgIAP&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwCDgK|publisher=PEN America Center|title=PEN America 13: Lovers|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and translated to Yoruba.&lt;ref name=blazing/&gt;

On May 4, 2015, his book, Herbert Macaulay and the Spirit of Lagos was staged at University of Ilorin, Kwara state at the Performing Arts Theatre, it was directed by Adams Abdulfatai Ayomide, for the annual season of plays festival.

In 2000, in recognition of his immense contributions, he was awarded the National Merit Award and the Fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Letters. He was a visiting professor at the [[University of Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nnma.gov.ng/CITATION%20ON%20PROFESSOR%20AKINWUMI%20ISOLA.pdf|title=Citation on Professor Akinwunmi Isola|website=Nigerian National Nerit Award|format=pdf|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iraq War misappropriation''' refers to allegations that billions of dollars of US government funds, originally meant for reconstruction and rebuilding programs, were misappropriated during the Iraq War.

==Official audits and investigations==
In July 2008, the [[United States Department of Justice]] investigated around 900 cases of alleged fraud committed by contractors.&lt;ref name="arabnews"&gt;Barbara Ferguson: "[http://www.arabnews.com/node/314223 Private contractors steal billions from Uncle Sam]". [[ArabNews]], 30 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the [[Defense Contract Audit Agency]] uncovered $10 billion in questionable Iraq contracts,&lt;ref name="arabnews" /&gt; and a US audit found that the occupation authority had lost track of reconstruction funds totalling nearly $9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/feb/01/iraq.suzannegoldenberg |title=Audit reveals abuse of $9bn works funds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Waxman]], then Chairman of the [[United States House of Representatives]] [[Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]], said, "The money that's gone into waste, fraud and abuse under these contracts is just so outrageous, it's egregious. It may well turn out to be the largest war profiteering in history."&lt;ref name="Iraq billions"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7444083.stm "BBC uncovers lost Iraq billions"], [[Jane Corbin]], [[BBC News]], 10 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media investigations==
$12 billion in U.S. currency was transported from the [[Federal Reserve]] to Baghdad in April 2003 and June 2004, where it was dispensed by the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]]. A [[Vanity Fair magazine]] report concluded that of this sum, "at least $9 billion has gone missing".&lt;ref&gt;

[[BBC]] television program, ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' (9 June 2008) investigated using US and Iraqi government sources to research how much some private contractors had profited from the conflict and rebuilding and claimed that "as much as $23bn (£11.75bn) may have been lost, stolen or not properly accounted for in Iraq".&lt;ref name="Daylight Robbery"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/7438372.stm "Daylight Robbery"], [[BBC]], 9 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]: Iraq's Missing Billions'', produced by [[The Guardian|Guardian]] Films (March 20, 2006).&lt;ref name="awash in cash"/&gt;

A blog on [[Huffington Post]] alleged that there "immunized foreign contractors" were involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bennet-kelley/bush-reveals-true-reason_b_115487.html|title=Bush Reveals True Reason for War in Push for Iraqi Agreement|author=User Submitted|work=RINF Alternative News &amp; Alternative Media - Breaking News Real Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; US courts issued [[gag order]]s that prevent the prosecution or defense from discussing the allegations. The orders apply to 70 court cases against some of top US contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7444083.stm|title=BBC uncovers lost Iraq billions
|publisher=BBC |date=June 10, 2008 |first=Jane |last=Corbin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missing UN funds==
At the start of the Iraq war, the [[United Nations]] awarded $23 billion of Iraqi money to the US-led coalition to re-develop Iraq.&lt;ref name="awash in cash"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/20/usa.iraq "'Iraq was awash in cash. We played football with bricks of $100 bills'"], Callum Macrae and Ali Fadhil, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''grammar''' of '''[[American Sign Language]]''' (ASL) is the best studied of any [[sign language]], though research is still in its infancy, dating back only to [[William Stokoe]] in the 1960s.

==Morphology==
ASL [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] is to a large extent [[iconicity|iconic]]. This shows up especially well in [[reduplication]] and indexicality.

===Derivation===
[[Compound (linguistics)|Compounding]] is used to derive new words in ASL, which often differ in meaning from their constituent signs.&lt;ref name="b20"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bahan|1996|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the signs FACE and STRONG compound to create a new sign FACE^STRONG, meaning 'to resemble'.&lt;ref name="b20" /&gt; Compounds undergo the phonetic process of "hold deletion", whereby the holds at the end of the first constituent and the beginning of the second are [[elision|elided]]:&lt;ref name="b20" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|+ ASL compounding&lt;ref name="b21"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bahan|1996|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
! colspan="2" align="center" | Individual signs
! align="center" |Compound sign
|-
| FACE
| STRONG
| FACE^STRONG
|-
| '''M'''H
| H'''MH'''
| '''MMH'''
|}

Many ASL nouns are derived from verbs.&lt;ref name="b21" /&gt; This may be done either by [[reduplication|reduplicating]] the [[movement (sign language)|movement]] of the verb if the verb has a single movement, or by restraining (making smaller and faster) the movement of the verb if it already has repeated movement.&lt;ref name="b21-22"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bahan|1996|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the noun CHAIR is derived from the verb SIT through reduplication.&lt;ref name="b21-22" /&gt;  Another [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]] method is available for deriving nouns from non-stative verbs.&lt;ref name="b22-23"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bahan|1996|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of derivation modifies the verb's movement, reduplicating it in a "trilled" manner ("small, quick, stiff movements").&lt;ref name="b22-23" /&gt; For example, this method is used to derive the noun ACTION from the verb ACT.&lt;ref name="b22-23" /&gt;

Characteristic adjectives, which refer to inherent states, may be derived from adjectives which refer to "incidental or temporary states".&lt;ref name="b23"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bahan|1996|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristic adjectives always use both hands, even if the source adjective only uses one, and they always have repeated, circular movement.&lt;ref name="b23" /&gt; Additionally, if the source adjective was one-handed, the derived adjective has alternating movement.&lt;ref name="b23" /&gt; "Trilling" may also be used productively to derive adjectives with an "ish" meaning, e.g. BLUE becomes BLUISH.&lt;ref name="b24"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bahan|1996|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASL occasionally uses [[suffix]]ation in derivation, but less often than in English.&lt;ref name="b24" /&gt; Agent nouns may be derived from verbs by adding the suffix AGENT and deleting the final hold of the verb, e.g. TEACH+AGENT 'teacher'.&lt;ref name="b24" /&gt; Superlatives are also formed by suffixation, e.g. SMART+MOST 'smartest'.&lt;ref name="b25"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bahan|1996|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain types of signs, for example those relating to time and age, may incorporate numbers by assimilating their handshape.&lt;ref name="b25" /&gt; For example, the word WEEK has handshape /B/ with the weak hand and /1/ with the active hand; the active hand's handshape may be changed to the handshape of any number up to 9 to indicate that many weeks.&lt;ref name="b25" /&gt;

There are about 20 non-manual modifiers in ASL, which are either adjectival or adverbial.&lt;ref name="b50"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bahan|1996|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the adverb '&lt;u&gt;th&lt;/u&gt;', realized as the tongue being placed between the teeth, means 'carelessly / lazily' when combined with a verb:&lt;ref name="b50-51"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bahan|1996|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{|
| || ||
|-
| JOHN || WRITE || LETTER
|-
| colspan="3" | 'John writes a letter.'
|-
| || &lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;th&lt;/u&gt; ||
|-
| JOHN || WRITE || LETTER
|-
| colspan="3" | 'John writes a letter carelessly.'
|}

===Degree===
[[Mouthing]] (making what appear to be speech sounds) is important for fluent signing, and it has morphological uses. For example, one may sign 'man tall' to indicate ''the man is tall,'' but by mouthing the syllable ''cha'' while signing 'tall', the phrase becomes ''that man is enormous!''

There are other ways of modifying a verb or adjective to make it more intense. These are all more or less equivalent to adding the word "very" in English; which morphology is used depends on the word being modified. Certain words which are short in English, such as 'sad' and 'mad', are sometimes fingerspelled rather than signed to mean 'very sad' and 'very mad'. However, the concept of 'very sad' or 'very mad' can be portrayed with the use of exaggerated body movements and facial expressions.  Reduplication of the signs may also occur to emphasize the degree of the statement. Some signs are produced with an exaggeratedly large motion, so that they take up more sign space than normal. This may involve a back-and-forth scissoring motion of the arms to indicate that the sign ought to be yet larger, but that one is physically incapable of making it big enough. Many other signs are given a slow, tense production. The fact that this modulation is morphological rather than merely [[mimesis|mimetic]] can be seen in the sign for 'fast': both 'very slow' and 'very fast' are signed by making the motion either unusually slowly or unusually quickly than it is in the citation forms of 'slow' and 'fast'—not exclusively by making it slower for 'very slow' and faster for 'very fast'.

===Reduplication===
[[Reduplication]] (morphological repetition) is extremely common in ASL. Generally the motion of the sign is shortened as well as repeated. Nouns may be derived from verbs through reduplication. For example, the noun ''chair'' is formed from the verb ''to sit'' by repeating it with a reduced degree of motion. Similar relationships exist between ''acquisition'' and ''to get, airplane'' and ''to fly (on an airplane),'' also ''window'' and ''to open/close a window.''

Reduplication is commonly used to express intensity as well as several verbal aspects (see below). It is also used to derive signs such as 'every two weeks' from 'two weeks', and is used for verbal number (see below), where the reduplication is iconic for the repetitive meaning of the sign.

===Compounds===
Many ASL words are historically compounds. However, the two elements of these signs have fused, with features being lost from one or both, to create what might be better called a [[wikt:blend|blend]] than a compound. Typically only the final hold (see above) remains from the first element, and any reduplication is lost from the second.

An example is the verb ''[[wikt:1@Sfhead-PalmDown 1@RadialHand-PalmDown-1@CenterChesthigh-PalmDown|AGREE]]'', which derives from the two signs ''[[wikt:1@NearSfhead-PalmDown 1@Sfhead-PalmDown|THINK]]'' and ''ALIKE''. The verb ''THINK'' is signed by bringing a 1 hand inward and touching the forehead (a move and a hold). ''ALIKE'' is signed by holding two 1 hands parallel, pointing outward, and bringing them together two or three times. The compound/blend ''AGREE'' starts as ''THINK'' ends: with the index finger touching the forehead (the final hold of that sign). In addition, the weak hand is already in place, in anticipation of the next part of the sign. Then the hand at the forehead is brought down parallel to the weak hand; it approaches but does not make actual contact, and there is no repetition.

===Affixes===
ASL, like other mature signed languages, makes extensive use of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]].&lt;ref&gt;Aronoff, M., Meir, I., &amp; Sandler, W. (2005). The paradox of sign language morphology. ''Language'', ''81''(2), 301.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of ASL's [[affix]]es are combined simultaneously rather than sequentially. For example, [[Ted Supalla]]'s seminal work on ASL verbs of motion revealed that these signs consist of many different affixes, articulated simultaneously according to complex grammatical constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Supalla, T. R. (1982). ''Structure and acquisition of verbs of motion and location in American Sign Language'' (Doctoral dissertation, ProQuest Information &amp; Learning).&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from the [[Morphology (linguistics)|concatenative]] morphology of many spoken languages, which except for [[suprasegmental feature]]s such as tone are tightly constrained by the sequential nature of voice sounds.

ASL does have a limited number of concatenative affixes. For example, the agentive suffix (similar to the English '-er') is made by placing two B or 5 hands in front of the torso, palms facing each other, and lowering them. On its own this sign means 'person'; in a compound sign following a verb, it is a suffix for the performer of the action, as in 'drive-er' and 'teach-er'. However, it cannot generally be used to translate English '-er', as it is used with a much more limited set of verbs. It is very similar to the '-ulo' suffix in [[Esperanto]], meaning 'person' by itself and '-related person' when combined with other words.

An ASL prefix, (touching the chin), is used with number signs to indicate 'years old'. The prefix completely [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilates]] with the initial handshape of the number. For instance, 'fourteen' is signed with a B hand that bends several times at the knuckles. The chin-touch prefix in 'fourteen years old' is thus also made with a B hand. For 'three years old', however, the prefix is made with a 3 hand.

===Numeral incorporation and classifiers {{anchor|Classifiers}}===
Rather than relying on sequential affixes, ASL makes heavy use of simultaneous modification of signs. One example of this is found in the aspectual system (see below); another is ''numeral [[incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]]:'' There are several families of two-handed signs which require one of the hands to take the handshape of a numeral. Many of these deal with time. For example, drawing the dominant hand lengthwise across the palm and fingers of a flat B hand indicates a number of weeks; the dominant hand takes the form of a numeral from one to nine to specify how many weeks. There are analogous signs for 'weeks ago' and 'weeks from now', etc., though in practice several of these signs are only found with the lower numerals.

ASL also has a system of [[classifier handshape|classifier]]s which may be incorporated into signs.&lt;ref&gt;Supalla, T. (1986). The classifier system in American sign language. ''Noun classes and categorization'', 181-214.&lt;/ref&gt; A fist may represent an inactive object such as a rock (this is the default or neutral classifier), a horizontal ILY hand may represent an aircraft, a horizontal 3 hand (thumb pointing up and slightly forward) a motor vehicle, an upright G hand a person on foot, an upright V hand a pair of people on foot, and so on through higher numbers of people. These classifiers are moved through sign space to iconically represent the actions of their referents. For example, an ILY hand may 'lift off' or 'land on' a horizontal B hand to sign an aircraft taking off or landing; a 3 hand may be brought down on a B hand to sign parking a car; and a G hand may be brought toward a V hand to represent one person approaching two.

The frequency of classifier use depends greatly on genre, occurring at a rate of 17.7% in narratives but only 1.1% in casual speech and 0.9% in formal speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/sls.2003.0003 |title=Frequency Characteristics of American Sign Language |year=2003 |last1=Morford |first1=Jill|author-link = Jill Morford |last2=MacFarlane |first2=James |journal=Sign Language Studies |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frames===
Frames are a morphological device that may be unique to sign languages (Liddell 2004). They are incomplete sets of the features which make up signs, and they combine with existing signs, absorbing features from them to form a derived sign. It is the frame which specifies the number and nature of segments in the resulting sign, while the basic signs it combines with lose all but one or two of their original features.

One, the &lt;sup&gt;WEEKLY&lt;/sup&gt; frame, consists of a simple downward movement. It combines with the signs for the days of the week, which then lose their inherent movement. For example, 'Monday' consists of an M/O hand made with a circling movement. 'Monday&lt;sup&gt;WEEKLY&lt;/sup&gt;' (that is, 'on Mondays') is therefore signed as an M/O hand that drops downward, but without the circling movement. A similar &lt;sup&gt;ALL DAY&lt;/sup&gt; frame (a sideward pan) combines with times of the day, such as 'morning' and 'afternoon', which likewise keep their handshape and location but lose their original movement. Numeral incorporation (see above) also uses frames. However, in ASL frames are most productively utilized for verbal aspect.

===Verbal aspect===
&lt;!-- Some of the adjectives in the list of frames appear to be questionable, but someone with expertise in ASL and/or access to reference material about ASL can either confirm or refute their authenticity. The word "predisposional" maybe should be "predispositional". The word "semblitive" maybe should be "semblative", in harmony with "semblance" and "resemblance". --&gt;

While there is no grammatical [[Grammatical tense|tense]] in ASL, there are numerous verbal [[aspect (linguistics)|aspects]]. These are produced by modulating the verb: Through reduplication, by placing the verb in an aspectual frame (see above), or with a combination of these means.

An example of an aspectual frame is the ''unrealized inceptive'' aspect ('just about to X'), illustrated here with the verb 'to tell'. 'To tell' is an indexical (directional) verb, where the index finger (a G hand) begins with a touch to the chin and then moves outward to point out the recipient of the telling. 'To be just about to tell' retains just the locus and the initial chin touch, which now becomes the final hold of the sign; all other features from the basic verb (in this case, the outward motion and pointing) are dropped and replaced by features from the frame (which are shared with the unrealized inceptive aspects of other verbs such as 'look at', 'wash the dishes', 'yell', 'flirt', etc.). These frame features are: Eye gaze toward the locus (which is no longer pointed at with the hand), an open jaw, and a hand (or hands, in the case of two-hand verbs) in front of the trunk which moves in an arc to the onset location of the basic verb (in this case, touching the chin), while the trunk rotates and the signer inhales, catching her breath during the final hold. The hand shape throughout the sign is whichever is required by the final hold, in this case a G hand.

The variety of aspects in ASL can be illustrated by the verb 'to be sick', which involves the middle finger of the Y/8 hand touching the forehead, and which can be modified by a large number of frames. Several of these involve reduplication, which may but need not be analyzed as part of the frame. (The appropriate non-manual features are not described here.)
* [[stative]] "to be sick" is made with simple iterated contact, typically with around four iterations. This is the basic, [[citation form]] of the verb.
* [[inchoative]] "to get sick, to take sick" is made with a single straight movement to contact and a hold of the finger on the forehead.
* predisposional "to be sickly, to be prone to get sick" is made with incomplete motion: three even circular cycles without contact. This aspect adds reduplication to verbs such as 'to look at' which do not already contain repetition.
* susceptative "to get sick easily" is made with a thrusting motion: The onset is held; then there is a brief, tense thrust that is checked before actual contact can be made.
* [[frequentative]] "to be often sick" is given a [[marcato]] articulation: A regular beat, with 4-6 iterations, and marked onsets and holds.
* susceptive and frequentative may be combined to mean "to get sick easily and often": Four brief thrusts on a marked, steady beat, without contact with the forehead.
* protractive "to be continuously sick" is made with a long, tense hold and no movement at all.
* incessant "to get sick incessantly" has a reduplicated [[tremolo]] articulation: A dozen tiny, tense, uneven iterations, as rapid as possible and without contact.
* durative "to be sick for a long time" is made with a reduplicated [[elliptical]] motion: Three slow, uneven cycles, with a heavy downward brush of the forehead and an arching return.
* [[iterative]] "to get sick over and over again" is made with three tense movements and slow returns to the onset position.
* intensive "to be very sick" is given a single tense articulation: A tense onset hold followed by a single very rapid motion to a long final hold.
* [[resultative]] "to become fully sick" (that is, a complete change of health) is made with an accelerando articulation: A single elongated tense movement which starts slowly and heavily, accelerating to a long final hold.
* approximative "to be sort of sick, to be a little sick" is made with a reduplicated lax articulation: A spacially extremely reduced, minimal movement, involving a dozen iterations without contact.
* semblitive "to appear to be sick" [no description]
* increasing "to get more and more sick" is made with the movements becoming more and more intense.

These modulations readily combine with each other to create yet finer distinctions. Not all verbs take all aspects, and the forms they do take will not necessarily be completely analogous to the verb illustrated here. Conversely, not all aspects are possible with this one verb.

Aspect is unusual in ASL in that [[transitive verb]]s derived for aspect lose their transitivity. That is, while you can sign 'dog chew bone' for ''the dog chewed on a bone,'' or 'she look-at me' for ''she looked at me,'' you cannot do the same in the durative to mean ''the dog gnawed on the bone'' or ''she stared at me.'' Instead, you must use other strategies, such as a topic construction (see below) to avoid having an object for the verb.

===Verbal number===
Reduplication is also used for expressing [[verbal number]]. Verbal number indicates that the action of the verb is repeated; in the case of ASL it is apparently limited to transitive verbs, where the motion of the verb is either extended or repeated to cover multiple object or recipient loci. (Simple plurality of action can also be conveyed with reduplication, but without indexing any object loci; in fact, such aspectual forms do not allow objects, as noted above.) There are specific dual forms (and for some signers [[trial number|trial]] forms), as well as plurals. With dual objects, the motion of the verb may be made twice with one hand, or simultaneously with both; while with plurals the object loci may be taken as a group by using a single sweep of the signing hand while the verbal motion is being performed, or individuated by iterating the move across the sweep. For example, 'to ask someone a question' is signed by flexing the index finger of an upright G hand in the direction of that person; the dual involves flexing it at both object loci (sequentially with one hand or simultaneously with both), the simple plural involves a single flexing which spans the object group while the hand arcs across it, and the individuated plural involves multiple rapid flexings while the hand arcs. If the singular verb uses reduplication, that is lost in the dual and plural forms.

==={{vanchor|Name signs}}===
There are three types of personal [[name sign]]s in ASL:  arbitrary, descriptive, and finger-spelled.  Once given, names are for life, apart from changing from one of the latter types to an arbitrary sign in childhood.  Name signs are usually assigned by another member of the Deaf community, and signal inclusion in that community. Name signs are not used to address people, as names are in English, but are used only for third-person reference, and usually only when the person is absent.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel J. Supalla (1992) ''The Book of Name Signs: Naming in American Sign Language''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of people, probably well in excess of 90%, have arbitrary name signs.  These are initialized signs:  The hand shape is the initial of one of the English names of the person, usually the first.&lt;ref&gt;The J hand shape is articulated with a brush of the pinkie finger against the sign location.  It cannot occur in neutral space.  There is no provision for Z:  that is, there are no Z-initial arbitrary name signs.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sign may occur in neutral space, with a tremble; with a double-tap (as a noun) at one of a limited number of specific locations, such as the side of the chin, the temple, or the elbow;&lt;ref&gt;Contrastive locations are limited to the temple, forehead, side of chin, chin, shoulder, chest, outside of elbow, inside of elbow, palm of a vertical flat hand, back of a horizontal back hand.  Some name signs are distinguished by orientation.  For example, an I hand shape may make contact with either the tip of the pinkie finger or the side of the thumb; the M hand shape with either the tips of the three fingers or the side of the index finger, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; or moving across a location or between two locations, with a single tap at each.&lt;ref&gt;The two locations are usually close by, such as the hand moving across the chin or down the chest, but may occasionally be further apart, as from the shoulder to the back of the hand.&lt;/ref&gt;  Single-location signs are simpler in connotation, like English "Vee"; double-location signs are fancier, like English "Veronica".  Sam Supalla (1992) collected 525 simple arbitrary name signs like these.

There are two constraints on arbitrary signs.  First, it should not mean anything.  That is, it should not duplicate an existing ASL word.&lt;ref&gt;There are occasional exceptions to this constraint.  For example, [[I. King Jordan]]'s name sign is homophonous with "king" (K hand moving from the shoulder to the hip).&lt;/ref&gt;  Second, there should not be more than one person with the name sign in the local community.  If a person moves to a new community where someone already has their name sign, then the newcomer is obligated to modify theirs.  This is usually accomplished by compounding the hand shape, so that the first tap of the sign takes the initial of the person's first English name, and the second tap takes the initial of their last name.  There are potentially thousands of such compound-initial signs.

Descriptive name signs are not initialized, but rather use ASL classifiers.  They tend to be assigned and used by children, rather like "Blinky" in English.  Parents do not give such names to their children, but most Deaf people do not have deaf parents and are assigned their name sign by classmates in their first school for the deaf.  At most 10% of Deaf people retain such name signs into adulthood.  Descriptive signs were perhaps more common when deaf education was first established:  Clerc and T.H. Gallaudet all have descriptive name signs (though Clerc's was presumably his French Sign Language name).  Arbitrary name signs became established very early in the history of ASL.

The two systems, arbitrary and descriptive, are sometimes combined, usually for humorous purposes.  For example, U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] may be signed by signing "to lie" with his initial, N, as the hand shape, effectively meaning "Nixon the Liar".  Hearing people learning ASL are also often assigned combined name signs.  This is not traditional for Deaf people.

Sometimes people with very short English names, such as "Ann" or "Lee", or ones that flow easily, such as "Larry", may never acquire a name sign, but may instead be referred to with finger-spelling.

==Syntax==
ASL is a [[subject-verb-object]] (SVO) language.&lt;ref name="b30"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bahan|1996|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This default word order is sometimes altered by processes including [[topicalization]] and null elements;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pichler|first=Deborah Chen|title=Word order variation and acquisition in American Sign Language|year=2001|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this is marked either with non-manual signals like eyebrow or body position, or with [[prosodic]] marking such as pausing.&lt;ref name="b30" /&gt; These non-manual grammatical markings (such as eyebrow movement or head-shaking) may optionally spread over the [[c-command]] domain of the node which it is attached to.&lt;ref name="b31"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bahan|1996|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ASL is a [[pro-drop language]], and when the manual sign that a non-manual grammatical marking is attached to is omitted, the non-manual marking obligatorily spreads over the c-command domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neidle|first=Carol|title=Language across modalities: ASL focus and question constructions|journal=Linguistic Variation YEarbook|year=2002|volume=2|issue=1|pages=71–98|doi=10.1075/livy.2.05nei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full sentence structure in ASL is [topic] [subject] verb [object] [subject-pronoun-tag].  Topics and ''tags'' are both indicated with non-manual features, and both give a great deal of flexibility to ASL word order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aarons|first=DebraAspects of the syntax of American Sign Language|title=Aspects of the syntax of American Sign Language|year=1994|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a [[noun phrase]], the word order is noun-number and noun-adjective.

ASL does not have a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] (linking 'to be' verb).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pichler|first=Deborah Chen|title=Word order variation and acquisition in American Sign Language|year=2001|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, ''my hair is wet'' is signed 'my hair wet', and ''my name is Pete'' may be signed '[name my]&lt;sup&gt;TOPIC&lt;/sup&gt; P-E-T-E'.

===Tense and aspect===
It has been claimed that [[grammatical tense|tense]] in ASL is marked [[adverb]]ially, and that ASL lacks a separate category of tense markers.&lt;ref name="b33"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bahan|1996|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aarons et al. (1992, 1995) argue that "[[grammatical tense|Tense]]" (T) is indeed a distinct category of syntactic [[head (linguistics)|head]], and that the T node can be occupied either by a modal (e.g. SHOULD) or a lexical tense marker (e.g. FUTURE-TENSE).&lt;ref name="b33" /&gt; They support this claim by noting that only one such item can occupy the T slot:&lt;ref name="b33-34"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bahan|1996|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{|

Aspect may be marked either by verbal inflection or by separate lexical items.&lt;ref name="b27" &gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bahan|1996|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are ordered: Tense&amp;nbsp;– Negation&amp;nbsp;– Aspect&amp;nbsp;– Verb:&lt;ref name="b34-37"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bahan|1996|pp=34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topic and main clauses===
A topic sets off background information that will be discussed in the following main clause. Topic constructions are not often used in standard English, but they are common in some dialects, as in,

{{quotation|That dog, I never could hunt him.}}

Topicalization is used productively in ASL and often results in surface forms that do not follow the basic SVO word order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pichler|first=Deborah Chen|title=Word order variation and acquisition in American Sign Language|year=2001|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to non-manually mark topics, the eyebrows are raised and the head is tilted back during the production of a topic. The head is often lowered toward the end of the sign, and sometimes the sign is followed rapidly nodding the head. A slight pause follows the topic, setting it off from the rest of the sentence:&lt;ref name="Aarons 1994 70"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aarons|first=Debra|title=Aspects of the syntax of American Sign Language|year=1994|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|[MEAT]&lt;sup&gt;tm&lt;/sup&gt;, I LIKE LAMB''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for meat, I prefer lamb.}}

Another way topics may be signed is by shifting the body. The signer may use the space on one side of his/her body to sign the topic, and then shifts to the other side for the rest of the sentence.&lt;ref name="Aarons 1994 70"/&gt;

ASL utterances do not require topics, but their use is extremely common. They are used for purposes of [[information flow]], to set up referent loci (see above), and to supply objects for verbs which are grammatically prevented from taking objects themselves (see below).

Without a topic, ''the dog chased my cat'' is signed:

{{quotation|DOG CHASE MY CAT}}

However, people tend to want to set up the object of their concern first and then discuss what happened to it. In English, we do this with [[Passive voice|passive]] clauses: ''my cat was chased by the dog.'' In ASL, topics are used with similar effect:

{{quotation|''[MY CAT]&lt;sup&gt;tm&lt;/sup&gt; DOG CHASE''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;or literally&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'my cat, the dog chased it.'}}

If the word order of the main clause is changed, the meaning of the utterance also changes:

{{quotation|''[MY CAT]&lt;sup&gt;tm&lt;/sup&gt; CHASE DOG''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;means&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'my cat chased the dog,'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;or literally, 'my cat, it chased the dog.'}}

There are three types of non-manual topic markers, all of which involve raised eyebrows.&lt;ref name="b41-42" /&gt; The three types of non-manual topic markers are used with different types of topics and in different contexts, and the topic markings cannot spread over other elements in the utterance. Topics can be moved from and remain null in the main clause of an utterance, or topics can be base-generated and either be co-referential to either the subject or object in the main clause or be related to the subject of object by a semantic property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aarons|first=Debra|title=Aspects of the syntax of American Sign Language|year=1994|pages=151–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first type of non-manual marking, topic marking 1 (tm1), is only used with a moved topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aarons|first=Debra|title=Aspects of the syntax of American Sign Language|year=1994|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tm1 is characterized by raised eyebrows, widened eyes, and head tilted backwards. At the end of the sign the head moves down and there is a pause, often with an eye blink, before the sentence is continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aarons|first=Debra|title=Aspects of the syntax of American Sign Language|year=1994|pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following is an example of a context in which the tm1 marking is used:

{{quotation|[MARY]&lt;sup&gt;tm1&lt;/sup&gt; JOHN LOVE''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'Mary, John loves,' or 'John loves Mary'}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aarons|first=Debra|title=Aspects of the syntax of American Sign Language|year=1994|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topic marking 2 (tm2) and topic marking 3 (tm3) are both used with base-generated topics. Tm2 is characterized by raised eyebrows, widened eyes, and the head tilted backwards and to the side. Toward the end of the sign the head moves forward and to the opposite side, and there is a pause and often an eye blink before continuing.&lt;ref name="Aarons 1994 160"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aarons|first=Debra|title=Aspects of the syntax of American Sign Language|year=1994|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; For tm3 the eyebrows are raised and the eyes are opened wide, the head starts tilted down and jerks up and down, the lips are opened and raised, and the head is nodded rapidly a few times before pausing and continuing the sentence. Although both tm2 and tm3 accompany base-generated topics, they are used in different contexts. Tm2 is used to introduce new information and change the topic of a conversation to something that the signer is going to subsequently characterize, while tm3 is used to introduce new information that the signer believes is already known by his/her interlocutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aarons|first=Debra|title=Aspects of the syntax of American Sign Language|year=1994|pages=163–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tm2 may be used with any base-generated topic, whereas only topics that are co-referential with an argument in the sentence may be marked with tm3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pichler|first=Deborah Chen|title=Word order variation and acquisition in American Sign Language|year=2001|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a tm2 marking used with a topic related to the object of the main clause is:

{{quotation|[VEGETABLE]&lt;sup&gt;tm2&lt;/sup&gt;, JOHN LIKE CORN''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'As for vegetables, John likes corn.'&lt;ref name="Aarons 1994 160"/&gt;}}

An example of a tm2 marking used with a co-referential topic is:

{{quotation|[FRESH VEGETABLE]&lt;sup&gt;tm2&lt;/sup&gt;, JOHN LIKE IX-3rd''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'As for fresh vegetables, John likes them.'&lt;ref name="Aarons 1994 162"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aarons|first=Debra|title=Aspects of the syntax of American Sign Language|year=1994|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

IX-3rd represents a 3rd person index.

Another example of a tm2 marking with a co-referential topic is:

{{quotation|[JOHN&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;tm2&lt;/sup&gt;, IX-3rd&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; LOVE MARY''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'as for John, he loves Mary'&lt;ref name="Aarons 1994 162"/&gt; }}

An example of a tm3 topic marking is:

{{quotation|[JOHN&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;tm3&lt;/sup&gt;, IX-3rd&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; LOVE MARY''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'(you know) John, he loves Mary'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aarons|first=Debra|title=Aspects of the Syntax of American Sign Language|year=1994|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

ASL sentences may have up to two marked [[grammatical topic|topic]]s.&lt;ref name="b41-42"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bahan|1996|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible combinations of topic types are two tm2 topics, two tm3 topics, tm2 preceding tm1, tm3 preceding tm1, and tm2 preceding tm3. Sentences with these topic combinations in the opposite orders or with two tm1 topics are considered ungrammatical by native signers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aarons|first=Debra|title=Aspects of the syntax of American Sign Language|year=1994|pages=177–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subject pronoun tags===
Information may also be added after the main clause as a kind of 'afterthought'. In ASL this is commonly seen with subject pronouns. These are accompanied by a nod of the head, and make a statement more emphatic:

{{quotation|''boy fall''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The boy fell down."}}
versus
{{quotation|''boy fall [he]&lt;sup&gt;TAG&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The boy fell down, he did."}}

The subject need not be mentioned, as in

{{quotation|''fall''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"He fell down."}}
versus
{{quotation|''fall [he]&lt;sup&gt;TAG&lt;/sup&gt;''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"He fell down, he did."}}

===Aspect, topics, and transitivity===
As noted above, in ASL aspectually marked verbs cannot take objects. To deal with this,  the object must be known from context so that it does not need to be further specified. This is accomplished in two ways:
# The object may be made prominent in a prior clause, or
# It may be used as the topic of the utterance at hand.
Of these two strategies, the first is the more common. For ''my friend was typing her term paper all night'' to be used with a durative aspect, this would result in

{{quotation|''my friend type T-E-R-M paper. type&lt;sup&gt;DURATIVE&lt;/sup&gt; all-night''}}

The less colloquial topic construction may come out as,

===Negation===
[[negation|Negated]] clauses may be signaled by shaking the head during the entire clause. A topic, however, cannot be so negated; the headshake can only be produced during the production of the main clause. (A second type of negation starts with the verb and continues to the end of the clause.)

In addition, in many communities, negation is put at the end of the clause, unless there is a wh- question word. For example, the sentence, "I thought the movie was not good," could be signed as, "BEFORE MOVIE ME SEE, THINK WHAT? IT GOOD NOT."

There are two manual signs that negate a sentence, NOT and NONE, which are accompanied by a shake of the head. NONE is typically used when talking about possession:

:English:  I don't have any dogs.

:ASL:  DOG I HAVE NONE

NOT negates a verb:

:English:  I don't like to play tennis.

:ASL:  TENNIS I LIKE PLAY NOT

===Questions===
There are three types of questions with different types of constructions in ASL: wh- questions, yes/no questions, and rhetorical questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aarons|first=Debra|title=Aspects of the syntax of American Sign Language|year=1994|pages=67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wh- questions can be formed in a variety of ways. the wh- word can appear only at the end of the sentence, only at the beginning of the sentence, at both the beginning and end of the sentence, or in situ (i.ei where the wh- word is in the sentence structure before movement occurs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petronio|first=Karen|author2=Diane Lillo-Martin|url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/Reprints/HL1053.pdf|title=Wh-Movement and the Position of Spec-CP: Evidence from American Sign Language|journal=Linguistic Society of America|year=1997|volume=73|issue=1|pages=18–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manual wh- signs are also accompanied by a non-manual grammatical marking, which includes lowered or "scrunchy" eybrows, a slight frown, head and body tilted forwards, slightly rounded lips, and sometimes a sideways head-shake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aarons|first=Debra|title=Aspects of the syntax of American Sign Language|year=1994|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is disagreement about whether [[wh-words]] move rightward or leftward in ASL. While some researchers argue for rightward movement in wh- questions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neidle|first=Carol|title=Language across modalities: ASL focus and question constructions|journal=Linguistic Variation Yearbook|year=2002|volume=2|issue=1|pages=71–98|doi=10.1075/livy.2.05nei}}&lt;/ref&gt;  others, including Petronio and Lillo-Martin, have argued that ASL has leftward movement and wh- words that appear to the right of the clause move by other processes. Arguments for leftward movement are based on the facts that if wh- movement in ASL were rightward, ASL would be an exception to cross-linguistic generalizations that wh- movement is leftward and that wh- markers are not topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petronio|first=Karen|author2=Diane Lillo-Martin|title=WH- Movement and the Position of Spoec-CP: Evidence from American Sign Language|journal=Language|year=1997|volume=73|issue=1|pages=18–57|doi=10.2307/416592}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petronio and Lillo-Martin also demonstrate that the rightward-movement hypothesis allows utterances that native signers judge as ungrammatical but does not allow utterances that are considered grammatical. On the other hand, they show that the hypothesis that there is leftward wh- movement with other processes accounting for wh- elements appearing rightward accounts correctly for the same utterances that could not be explained by the rightward hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petronio|first=Karen|author2=Diane Lillo-Martin|title=WH-Movement and the Position of Spec-CP: Evidence from American Sign Language|journal=Language|year=1997|volume=73|issue=1|pages=18–57|doi=10.2307/416592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{|
| || 
| &lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;whq&lt;/u&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;(non-manual whq-marker)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| LOVE || JOHN || WHO ||
|-
| colspan="4" | 'Who loves John?' ||
|}
This movement can also be observed in the object position. For example, while YESTERDAY must normally follow the object, it may precede the whq-word "WHAT":&lt;ref name="b39-40"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bahan|1996|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{|
| JUAN || BUY || BOOK || YESTERDAY
|-
| colspan="4" | 'Juan bought a book yesterday.' ||
|}
:{|
| * JUAN || BUY || YESTERDAY || BOOK
|-
| colspan="4" | * 'Juan bought a book yesterday.' ||
|}
:{|
| || ||
| &lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;wh&lt;/u&gt;
|-
| JUAN || BUY || YESTERDAY || "WHAT"
|-
| colspan="4" | 'What did Juan buy yesterday?' ||
|}

ASL also has questions where the wh-word occurs twice, copied in final position:&lt;ref name="b40"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bahan|1996|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{|
| colspan="4" | &lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;wh&lt;/u&gt;
|-
| WHAT || JUAN || BUY || WHAT
|-
| colspan="4" | 'What did Juan buy?' ||
|}

Yes/no questions also require non-manual markings. Similar to the non-manual marking for wh- questions, the non-manual cue for yes/no questions include tilting the head and body forward. To distinguish the yes/no question marking from that of wh- questions, the yes/no arking also includes raised eyebrows and widened eyes as well as slightly pursed lips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aarons|first=Debra|title=Aspects of the syntax of American Sign Language|year=1994|pages=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike wh- questions, yes/no questions do not involve a change of word order, and the non-manual marking must be used over the whole utterance in order for it to be judged as a statement opposed to a question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aarons|first=Debra|title=Aspects of the syntax of American Sign Language|year=1994|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|YOU EAT [WHAT?]
&lt;br&gt;
What are you eating?}}

Raised eyebrows are also used for [[rhetorical question]]s which are not intended to elicit an answer. To distinguish the non-manual marking for rhetorical questions from that of yes/no questions, the body is in a neutral position opposed to tilted forward, and the head is tilted in a different way than in yes/no questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aarons|first=Debra|title=Aspects of the syntax of American Sign Language|year=1994|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetorical questions are much more common in ASL than in English. For example, ''I don't like garlic'' may be signed,

{{quotation|[I LIKE]&lt;sup&gt;NEGATIVE&lt;/sup&gt; [WHAT?]&lt;sup&gt;RHETORICAL&lt;/sup&gt;, GARLIC.}}

This strategy is commonly used instead of signing the word 'because' for clarity or emphasis. For instance, ''I love to eat pasta because I am Italian'' would be signed,

{{quotation|PASTA I EAT ENJOY TRUE [WHY?]&lt;sup&gt;RHETORICAL&lt;/sup&gt;, ITALIAN I.}}

===Relative clauses===
[[Relative clause]]s are signaled by tilting back the head and raising the eyebrows and upper lip. This is done during the performance of the entire clause. There is no change in word order. For example, ''the dog which recently chased the cat came home'' would be signed,

{{quotation|''[recently dog chase cat]&lt;sup&gt;RELATIVE&lt;/sup&gt; come home''}}

where the brackets here indicate the duration of the non-manual features. If the sign 'recently' were made without these features, it would lie outside the relative clause, and the meaning would change to "the dog which chased the cat recently came home".

===Deixis===
In ASL signers set up regions of space (loci) for specific referents (see above); these can then be referred to indexically by pointing at those locations with pronouns and indexical verbs.

====Pronouns====
Personal pronouns in ASL are indexic. That is, they point to their referent, or to a locus representing their referent. When the referent is physically present, pronouns involve simply pointing at the referent, with different handshapes for different pronominal uses: A 'G' handshape is a [[personal pronoun]], an extended 'B' handshape with an outward palm orientation is a [[possessive pronoun]], and an extended-thumb 'A' handshape is a [[reflexive pronoun]]; these may be combined with numeral signs to sign 'you two', 'us three', 'all of them', etc.

If the referent is not physically present, the speaker identifies the referent and then points to a location (the ''locus)'' in the sign space near their body. This locus can then be pointed at to refer to the referent. Theoretically, any number of loci may be set up, as long as the signer and recipient remember them all, but in practice, no more than eight loci are used.

Meier 1990 demonstrates that only two [[grammatical person]]s are distinguished in ASL: First person and non-first person, as in [[Damin]]. Both persons come in several numbers as well as with signs such as 'my' and 'by myself'.

Meier provides several arguments for believing that ASL does not formally distinguish second from third person. For example, when pointing to a person that is physically present, a pronoun is equivalent to either 'you' or '(s)he' depending on the discourse. There is nothing in the sign itself, nor in the direction of eye gaze or body posture, that can be relied on to make this distinction. That is, the same formal sign can refer to any of several second or third persons, which the indexic nature of the pronoun makes clear. In English, indexic uses also occur, as in 'I need ''you'' to go to the store and ''you'' to stay here', but not so ubiquitously. In contrast, several first-person ASL pronouns, such as the plural possessive ('our'), look different from their non-first-person equivalents, and a couple of pronouns do not occur in the first person at all, so first and non-first persons are formally distinct.

Personal pronouns have separate forms for singular ('I' and 'you/(s)he') and plural ('we' and 'you/they'). These have [[possessive pronoun|possessive]] counterparts: 'my', 'our', 'your/his/her', 'your/their'. In addition, there are pronoun forms which incorporate numerals from two to five ('the three of us', 'the four of you/them', etc.), though the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] pronouns are slightly idiosyncratic in form ''(i.e.,'' they have a K rather than 2 handshape, and the wrist nods rather than circles). These numeral-incorporated pronouns have no possessive equivalents.

Also among the personal pronouns are the 'self' forms ('by myself', 'by your/themselves', etc.). These only occur in the singular and plural (there is no numeral incorporation), and are only found as subjects. They have derived emphatic and 'characterizing' forms, with modifications used for derivation rather like those for verbal aspect. The 'characterizing' pronoun is used when describing someone who has just been mentioned. It only occurs as a non-first-person singular form.

Finally, there are formal pronouns used for honored guests. These occur as singular and plural in the non-first person, but only as singular in the first person.

ASL is a [[pro-drop]] language, which means that pronouns are not used when the referent is obvious from context and is not being emphasized.

====Indexical verbs====
Within ASL there is a class of indexical (often called 'directional') verbs. These include the signs for 'see', 'pay', 'give', 'show', 'invite', 'help', 'send', 'bite', etc. These verbs include an element of motion that indexes one or more referents, either physically present or set up through the referent locus system. If there are two loci, the first indicates the subject and the second the object, [[direct object|direct]] or [[indirect object|indirect]] depending on the verb, reflecting the basic word order of ASL. For example, 'give' is a bi-indexical verb based on a flattened M/O handshape. For 'I give you', the hand moves from myself toward you; for 'you give me', it moves from you to me. 'See' is indicated with a V handshape. Two loci for a dog and a cat can be set up, with the sign moving between them to indicate 'the dog sees the cat' (if it starts at the locus for dog and moves toward the locus for cat) or 'the cat sees the dog' (with the motion in the opposite direction), or the V hand can circulate between both loci and myself to mean 'we (the dog, the cat, and myself) see each other'. The verb 'to be in pain' (index fingers pointed at each other and alkuately{{clarify|date=February 2018}} approaching and separating) is signed at the location of the pain (head for headache, cheek for toothache, abdomen for stomachache, etc.). This is normally done in relation to the signer's own body, regardless of the person feeling the pain, but may take also use the locus system, especially for body parts which are not normally part of the sign space, such as the leg. There are also spatial verbs such as put-up and put-below, which allow signers to specify where things are or how they moved them around.

===Time-sequenced ordering===
ASL makes heavy use of time-sequenced ordering, meaning that events are signed in the order in which they occur. For example, for ''I was late to class last night because my boss handed me a huge stack of work after lunch yesterday,'' one would sign 'yesterday lunch finish, boss give-me work big-stack, night class late-me'. In stories, however, ordering is malleable, since one can choose to sequence the events either in the order in which they occurred or in the order in which one found out about them.

===Syntactic word order===
In addition to its basic topic–comment structure, ASL typically places an adjective after a noun, though it may occur before the noun for stylistic purposes. Numerals also occur after the noun, a very rare pattern among oral languages.

:English:  I have a brown dog.
:ASL:  DOG BROWN I HAVE

Adverbs, however, occur before the verbs.  Most of the time adverbs are simply the same sign as an adjective, distinguished by the context of the sentence.

:English:  I enter the house quietly.
:ASL:  HOUSE I QUIET ENTER

When the scope of the adverb is the entire clause, as in the case of time, it comes before the topic. This is the only thing which can appear before the topic in ASL: ''time–topic–comment.''

:English:  I'm going to the store at 9:00AM.

:ASL:  9-HOUR MORNING STORE I GO

[[Modal verb]]s come after the main verb of the clause:

:English:  I can go to the store for you.

:ASL:  FOR YOU, STORE I GO CAN

====Conjunctions====
There is no separate sign in ASL for the conjunction ''and''. Instead, multiple sentences or phrases are combined with a short pause between. Often, lists are specified with a listing and ordering technique, a simple version of which is to show the length of the list first with the nondominant hand, then to describe each element after pointing to the nondominant finger that represents it.

:English:  I have three cats and they are named Billy, Bob, and Buddy.
:ASL:  CAT I HAVE THREE-LIST. NAME, FIRST-OF-THREE-LIST B-I-L-L-Y, SECOND-OF-THREE-LIST B-O-B, THIRD-OF-THREE-LIST B-U-D-D-Y.

There is a manual sign for the conjunction ''or'', but the concept is usually signed nonmanually with a slight shoulder twist.

:English: I'll leave at 5 or 6 o'clock.
:ASL: I LEAVE TIME 5 [shoulder shift] TIME 6.

The manual sign for the conjunction ''but'' is similar to the sign for ''different''.  It is more likely to be used in [[Pidgin Signed English]] than in ASL.  Instead, shoulder shifts can be used, similar to "or" with appropriate facial expression.

:English:  I like to swim, but I don't like to run.
:ASL/PSE:  SWIM I LIKE, BUT RUN I LIKE-NOT
:ASL: SWIM I LIKE, [shoulder shift] RUN I LIKE-NOT

A '''bat phone''', in business [[jargon]], is a private [[telephone number]] that is handled at a higher priority than a public line.

==Batman comic==
The name derives from [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]]'s [[ringdown|secure line]] to the "Batphone" in the [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' television show]] of 1966–68. In the modern Batman comic book continuity, the Batphone made its debut in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #786 (November, 2003), in the form of an encrypted [[cellphone]] that allowed Gordon to securely contact Batman, as well as allowing other calls just like a normal cellphone.  It also carries a [[Tracking system|tracking device]] in case of trouble. Unlike the original Batphone, the device is not red and looks like a regular cellphone. This version also became the version of the [[Bat-Signal]] used in ''[[Batman: Earth One]]''.

==Use in pop culture==
In the HBO's TV series ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', super agent Ari Gold constantly uses his bat phone to conduct business.

A track named “Batphone” appears on the sixth album by Sheffield band Arctic Monkeys ''[[Tranquility Base Hotel &amp; Casino]]''.

==Use in the real world==
A bat phone often has some or all of the following properties:
*It gets answered outside of working hours
*It does not make the caller wait on hold or navigate through cumbersome [[Interactive voice response|voice menu]]s
*The line rings straight through to high-level management or technicians without having to be transferred from front lines. 
*The number is given only to selected people
*Shields technical personnel from receiving irrelevant calls

Bat phones are common in many industries. The phone numbers are typically given to key customers so that they may reach important individuals in case of emergencies or critical situations. Bat phones can also provide direct access to politicians or notable people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16546277/ |title="Telemarketers call Bloomberg's secure "bat phone" |publisher=MSNBC |date=January 10, 2007 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, police stations with front counters may have a call point for when the front counter is closed, nicknamed a "bat phone". In hospital [[Emergency department|accident &amp; emergency departments]], the "bat phone" is nickname for a red phone used to alert staff that a priority patient will soon be arriving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/i-spent-day-ashford-st-14178413|publisher=Get Surrey|title='I spent the day in Ashford and St Peter's busy A&amp;E department and learnt these 10 things'|date=17 Feb 2018|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.england.nhs.uk/improvement-hub/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2017/11/Acute-Care-case-studies-for-stroke-care.pdf NHS: Implementing best practice in acute care (p6)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of their use is for [[Internet service provider]]s offering a selection of Internet services that range from dial-up access to secure web server hosting. Customers using the secure web hosting facility would be given access to a 24-hour bat phone for prompt resolution of technical issues, while dialup customers seeking technical support would be required to wait on hold and/or call only during business hours.

[[File:Black and Burst zoomed in on a waveform.jpg|thumb|The sub carrier 'burst' seen from waveform monitor]]

'''Black and burst''' also known as '''bi-level sync''' and '''black burst''' is an [[analogue signal]] used in broadcasting. It consists of a video signal with a blacked-out picture.&lt;ref name="Talbot-Smith1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Talbot-Smith|title=Audio Engineer's Reference Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5weAQAAIAAJ|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Focal Press|isbn=978-0-7506-0386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to synchronise video signals together to put them on the same timing plane. It provides vertical timing that allows synchronous switching between two video signals.

Black and burst also locks the colour phase between signals. The burst section of the waveform allows the phase relationship of the two signals to be timed together by sending pulses to the internal oscillators of the equipment.

== History ==
[[PAL]] is a broadcast transmission standard for Europe, and from this standard the black and burst  analogue reference was created. Black and burst became common when the PAL video format became standard in Europe, then became the most commonly used reference signal.

Black and burst is now a predecessor to [[tri-level sync]].

== Waveform ==
Its natural waveform is a negative pulse of -40 [[IRE (unit)|IRE]] followed by 10 cycles of the colour sub carrier of video. For PAL video, the frequency of the sub carrier is 4.43361875MHZ.&lt;ref&gt;TV and Video Engineers Handbook, Third Edition - Eugene Trundle.

{{Sound change}}
In [[phonology]], particularly within [[historical linguistics]], '''dissimilation''' is a phenomenon whereby similar [[consonant]]s or [[vowel]]s in a [[word (linguistics)|word]] become less similar. For example, when a {{IPA|/r/}} sound occurs before another in the middle of a word in [[rhotic dialect]]s of English, the first tends to drop out, as in "beserk" for ''berserk,'' "suprise" for ''surprise,'' "paticular" for ''particular'', and "govenor" for ''governor''&lt;ref&gt;"{{IPA|/r/}} Dissimilation" in [http://linguistlist.org/issues/17/17-2235.html The Linguist List, 3 Aug 2006].&lt;/ref&gt; – this does not affect the pronunciation of ''government,'' which has only one {{IPA|/r/}}, but English ''government'' tends to be pronounced "goverment"&lt;!--sic--&gt;, dropping out the first n.

An example where a relatively old case of phonetic dissimilation has been artificially undone in the spelling is English ''[[wikt:colonel|colonel]]'', whose standard pronunciation is {{IPA|/ˈkɝnəl/}} (with the r sound) in North-American English, or {{IPA|/ˈkɜːnəl/}} in [[Received Pronunciation|RP]]. It was formerly spelt ''coronel'' and is a borrowing from French ''coronnel'', which arose as a result of dissimilation from Italian ''colonnello''.&lt;ref&gt;"Pronunciation Note" at [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/colonel Colonel @ Dictionary.Reference.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
There are several hypotheses on the cause of dissimilation. According to [[John Ohala]], listeners are confused by sounds with long-distance acoustic effects. In the case of English {{IPA|/r/}}, [[Rhotacism (sound change)#Linguistics|rhoticization]] spreads across much of the word: in rapid speech, many of the vowels may sound as if they had an ''r''. It may be difficult to tell whether a word has one source of rhoticity or two. When there are two, a listener might wrongly interpret one as an acoustic effect of the other, and so mentally filter it out.

This factoring out of [[coarticulation|coarticulatory]] effects has been experimentally replicated. For example, Greek ''pakhu-'' (παχυ-) "thick" derives from an earlier ''*phakhu-.'' When test subjects are asked to say the ''*phakhu-'' form in casual speech, the aspiration from both consonants pervades both syllables, making the vowels [[breathy voice|breathy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Listeners hear a single effect, breathy voiced vowels, and attribute it to one rather than both of the consonants, as they assume the breathiness on the other syllable to be a long-distance coarticulatory effect, thus replicating the historical change in the Greek word.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

If Ohala is correct, one might expect to find dissimilation in other languages with other sounds that frequently cause long-distance effects, such as [[nasalization]] and [[pharyngealization]].

==Examples==
In English ''r''-deletion, when a syllable is unstressed it may drop out altogether, as in "deteriate" for ''deteriorate'' and "tempature" for ''temperature,'' a process called [[haplology]]. When the {{IPA|/r/}} is found in {{IPA|/bru/}}, it may change to {{IPA|/j/}}: "Febyuary" for ''February,'' "defibyulator" for ''defibrillator,'' though this may be due to analogy with similar words, such as ''January'' and ''calculator'' (compare ''[[nucular]]'', which may have arisen through an analogous process).

==Types of dissimilation==
Dissimilation, like [[assimilation (phonetics)|assimilation]], may involve a change in pronunciation relative to a segment that is adjacent to the affected segment or at a distance, and may involve a change relative to a preceding or a following segment. As with assimilation, '''anticipatory''' dissimilation is much more common than '''lag''' dissimilation, but unlike assimilation, most dissimilation is triggered by ''non''-contiguous segments. Also, while many kinds of assimilation have the character of a [[sound law]], few dissimilations do; most are in the nature of accidents that befall a particular lexical item.

Anticipatory dissimilation at a distance (by far the most common):
* [[Latin]] *''medio-diēs'' ("mid-day", i.e. "noon"; also "south") became ''merīdiēs''. Latin ''venēnum'' "poison" &gt; [[Italian language|Italian]] ''veleno''.  This category includes a rare example of a systematic sound law, the dissimilation of aspirates in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]] known as [[Grassmann's Law]]: *''thi-thē-mi'' "I put" (with a reduplicated prefix) &gt; Greek ''tí-thē-mi'' (τίθημι), *''phakhu'' "thick" &gt; Greek ''pakhus'' (παχύς), *''sekhō'' "I have" &gt; *''hekhō'' &gt; Greek ''ékhō'' (ἔχω; cf. future *''hekh-s-ō'' &gt; ''héksō'' ἕξω). Some apparent cases are problematic, as in English "eksetera" for ''[[etcetera]]'', which may rather be contamination from the numerous forms in ''eks-'' (or a combination of influences), though the common misspelling ''ect''. implies dissimilation.

Anticipatory dissimilation from a contiguous segment (very rare):
* The change from fricative to stop articulation in a sequence of fricatives may belong here: German ''sechs'' {{IPA|/zeks/}} (as evidenced by the spelling, the {{IPA|/k/}} was previously a [[fricative]]). In Sanskrit in any original sequence of two [[sibilants]] the first became a stop (often with further developments): root ''vas''- "dress", fut. ''vas-sya''- &gt; ''vatsya''-; *''wiś-s'' "clan" (nom.sg.) &gt; *''viťś &gt; *viṭṣ &gt; viṭ'' (final clusters are simplified); *''wiś-su'' locative pl. &gt; *''viṭṣu &gt; vikṣu''. English ''amphitheater'' is very commonly pronounced ''ampitheater'' (though [[spelling pronunciation]] may be either some or all of the story here). Russian конфорка {{IPA|[kɐnˈforkə]}} 'stove burner' is from Dutch ''komfoor'' 'brazier'.

Lag dissimilation at a distance (fairly common):
* English "purple" is in medieval English as ''purpul'' and ''purpure'' (in medieval French ''porpre'') and comes from classical Latin ''purpura'' = "purple" with dissimilation of {{IPA|/r/}} to {{IPA|/L/}}. Latin ''rārus'' "rare" &gt; Italian ''rado''. ''Cardamom'' is commonly pronounced ''cardamon''. In Middle English, in some words ending in -''n'' preceded by a coronal consonant the ''-n'' changed to -''m'': ''seldom, random, venom''.  English ''marble'' is ultimately from Latin ''marmor''. Russian февраль {{IPA|/fevrˈalʲ/}} 'February' is from Latin ''Februārius''.
* In Spanish, interchanges between {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} are common; for a list, see [[History of the Spanish language#Interchange of the liquids {{IPA|/l/}} and /r/]]. In Basque, dissimilation is frequent as well.

Lag dissimilation from a contiguous segment (very rare):
* Latin ''hominem'' ("man", acc.)  &gt; [[Old Spanish]] ''omne'' &gt; ''omre'' &gt; [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''hombre''
* Latin ''nomen'' ("name", nom./acc.) &gt; ''nomre'' &gt; Spanish ''nombre''
* [[English language|English]] ''chimney'' (standard) &gt; ''chim(b)ley'' (dialectal)
* [[Proto-Slavic]] *''sveboda'' "freedom" &gt; [[Slovak language|Slovak]] "sloboda"
* In [[Irish language|Irish]], many dialects regularly change the sequence {{IPA|/mn/}} to {{IPA|/mɾ/}}

==Paradigmatic dissimilation==
When, through [[sound change]], elements of a grammatical paradigm start to conflate in a way that is not easily remedied through [[periphrasis|re-wording]], the forms may dissimilate. For example, in modern [[Korean language|Korean]] the vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}} are merging for many people in the capital Seoul, and concurrently the second-person pronoun 네 {{IPA|/ne/}} 'you' is shifting to 니 {{IPA|/ni/}} to avoid confusion with the first-person pronoun 내 {{IPA|/nɛ/}} 'me'.

Similarly, it appears that English ''[[she#Etymology|she]],'' historically ''heo'', may have acquired its modern ''sh'' form through dissimilation from ''he'', though it is not clear whether the mechanism was idiosyncratic sound change ([[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]]) of ''heo'', or substitution of ''heo'' with the feminine [[demonstrative pronoun]] ''seo''.

[[File:Roumanie 1947 12 lei.jpg|thumb|A Romanian stamp from 1947 showing a face value of 12 Lei.]]
The '''face value''' is the value of a [[coin]], [[Postage stamp|stamp]] or [[paper money]], as printed on the coin, stamp or bill itself&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/277068142|title=A dictionary of business and management.|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199234899|edition=5th|location=Oxford [England]|oclc=277068142}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the issuing authority. The face value of coins, stamps, or bill is usually its legal value. However, their market value need not bear any relationship to the face value. For example, some rare coins or stamps may be traded at prices considerably above their face value.

==Overview==
The face value of [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] usually represents the [[Debt|principal]] or [[redemption value]]. [[Interest]] payments are expressed as a percentage of face value. Before maturity, the actual value of a bond may be greater or less than face value, depending on the interest rate payable and the perceived risk of [[Default (finance)|default]]. As bonds approach [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]], actual value approaches face value.

In the case of [[stock]] certificates, face value is the [[par value]] of the stock. In the case of [[common stock]], par value is largely symbolic. In the case of [[preferred stock]], dividends may be expressed as a percentage of par value.

The face value of a [[life insurance]] policy is the death benefit. In the case of so-called "[[double indemnity (insurance)|double indemnity]]" life insurance policies, the [[beneficiary]] receives double the face value in case of accidental death.

The face value of [[Property insurance|property]], [[Casualty insurance|casualty]] or [[health insurance]] policies is the maximum amount payable, as stated on the policy's face or declarations page.

Face value can be used to refer to the apparent value of something other than a financial instrument, such as a concept or plan.  In this context, "face value" refers to the apparent merits of the idea, before the concept or plan has been tested.

Face value also refers to the price printed on a ticket to a sporting event, concert, or other event (the price the ticket was originally sold for by the organization hosting the event). The practice of re-selling tickets for more than face value (or a certain amount above face value) is commonly known as [[ticket scalping]].  

''Taking someone at face value'' is assuming another person's suggestion, offer, or proposal is sincere, rather than a bargaining ploy.{{Original research inline|date=September 2017}}

In [[ship|ships]], '''frames''' are ribs that are transverse bolted or welded to the [[keel]]. Frames support the [[hull (ship)|hull]] and give the ship its shape and strength.

In wooden shipbuilding, each frame is composed of several sections, so that the grain of the wood can follow the curve of the frame.  Starting from the keel, these are the '''floor''' (which crosses the keel and joins the frame to the keel), the '''first futtock''', the '''second futtock''', the '''top timber''', and the '''rail stanchion'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crothers |first=William L |title=The American-built Clipper Ship |date=1997 |publisher=International Marine |isbn=0-07-014501-6 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In steel shipbuilding, the entire frame can be formed in one piece by rivetting or welding sections; in this case the floor remains a separate piece, joining the frame on each side to the keel.

'''Frame numbers''' are the numerical values given to the frames; they begin at 1 with the aft-most frame, and numbers increase sequentially towards the bow. The total number vary per the length of a ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cutler |first=Thomas J |title=The Bluejackets' Manual |date=2002 |publisher=United States Naval Institute |isbn=1-55750-221-8 |oclc=50226164 |page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frames support lengthwise members which run parallel to the keel, from the bow to the stern; these may variously be called '''stringers''', '''strakes''', or '''clamps'''.  The clamp supports the transverse deck beams, on which the [[deck (ship)|deck]] is laid.

In [[printing]] and [[publishing]], '''proofs''' are the preliminary versions of publications meant for review by authors, editors, and proofreaders, often with extra-wide margins. '''Galley proofs''' may be uncut and unbound, or in some cases [[electronic publishing|electronically transmitted]]. They are created for [[proofreading]] and [[copyediting]] purposes, but may also be used for promotional and review purposes.&lt;ref name="Tapia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TFD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TR"/&gt;

== Historical galley proofs ==

'''Proof,''' in the typographical sense, is a term that dates from c. 1600.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; The primary goal of proofing is to create a tool for verification that the job is accurate. All needed or suggested changes are physically marked on paper proofs or electronically marked on electronic proofs by the author, editor, and proofreaders. The [[typesetter|compositor, typesetter]], or printer receives the edited copies, corrects and re-arranges the type or the pagination, and arranges for the press workers to print the final or published copies.

'''Galley proofs''' or '''galleys''' are so named because in the days of hand-set [[letterpress printing]] in the 1650s, the printer would set the page into galleys, namely the metal trays into which type was laid and tightened into place.&lt;ref name="OED.galley"/&gt; A small proof press would then be used to print a limited number of copies for [[proofreading]].&lt;ref name="OED.galley"/&gt; Galley proofs are thus, historically speaking, galleys printed on a proof press. 

From the printer's point of view, the galley proof, as it originated during the era of hand-set physical type, had two primary purposes, those being to check that the compositor had set the copy accurately (because sometimes individual pieces of type did get put in the wrong case after use) and that the type was free of defects (because type metal is comparatively soft, so type can get damaged). 

Once a defect-free galley proof was produced, the publishing house requested a number of galley proofs to be run off for distribution to editors and authors for a final reading and corrections to the text before the type was fixed in the chase for printing.

== Uncorrected proofs ==

An uncorrected proof is a proof version (on paper or in digital form) which is yet to receive final author and publisher approval. The term may also appear on the covers of advance reading copies; see below.

These days, because much typesetting and pre-press work is conducted digitally and transmitted electronically, the term  uncorrected proof is more common than the older term galley proof, which refers exclusively to a paper proofing system. However, if a paper print-out of an uncorrected proof is made on a desk-top printer or copy machine and used as a paper proof for authorial or editorial mark-up, it approximates a galley proof, and it may be referred to as a galley. 
 
Preliminary electronic proof versions are also sometimes called '''digital proofs,''' '''pdf proofs,''' and '''pre-fascicle''' proofs, the last because they are viewed as single pages, not as they will look when gathered into fascicles or signatures for the press.&lt;ref name="Knuth"/&gt;

== Final proofs ==

Proofs created by the printer for approval by the publisher before going to press are called '''final proofs.''' At this stage in production, all mistakes are supposed to have been corrected and the pages are set up in imposition for folding and cutting on the press. To correct a mistake at this stage entails an extra cost per page, so authors are discouraged from making many changes to final proofs, while last-minute corrections by the in-house publishing staff may be accepted. 

In the final proof stage, page layouts are examined closely. Additionally, because final page proofs contain the final [[pagination]], if an index was not compiled at an earlier stage in production, this pagination facilitates compiling a book's [[index (publishing)|index]] and correcting its table of contents.

== Advance reading copies ==

Historically, some publishers have used paper galley proofs as [[advance copy|advance copies or advance reading copies]] (ARCs) or as pre-publication publicity proofs. These are provided to reviewers, magazines, and libraries in advance of final publication. These galleys are not sent out for correction, but to ensure timely reviews of newly published works. The list of recipients designated by the publisher limits the number of copies to only what is required, making advance copies a form of [[print-on-demand]] (POD) publication. 

Pre-publication publicity proofs are normally gathered and bound in paper, but in the case of books with four-color printed illustrations, publicity proofs may be lacking illustrations or have them in black and white only.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} They may be marked or stamped on the cover "uncorrected proof," but the recipient is not expected to proofread them, merely to overlook any minor errors of typesetting. 

Galley proofs in electronic form are rarely used as advance reading copies due to the possibility of a recipient editing the proof and issuing it as their own. However, trusted colleagues are occasionally offered electronic advance reading copies, especially if the publisher wishes to quickly typeset a page or two of "advance praise" notices within the book itself.

fragments in Hebrew, 2nd century]]
[[File:Aramaic. Marriage Document, July 3, 449 B.C.E..jpg|thumb|Aramaic marriage document, July 3, 449 BCE]]
'''Hebrew and Aramaic papyri''' have increasingly been discovered from the 1960s onwards, although these [[papyrus|papyri]] remain rare compared to papyri written in [[Koine Greek]] and [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic Egyptian]] (no relation except in name, "popular," to modern [[demotic Greek]]). The most valuable and religious texts were written on leather scrolls, [[parchment]] - such as the literary texts from [[Masada]] and Qumran, while [[papyrus]] was employed for cheaper, domestic use.&lt;ref&gt;Lectures et relectures de la Bible: p. 248 André Wénin, Jean-Marie Auwers, Pierre Bogaert - 1999 "written on parchment, and some 13 percent on papyrus (see below). Likewise, thé Hebrew fïnds from Masada are mainly literary documents written on leather. On thé other hand, all thé documentary texts from Nahal Hever, Nahal Se'elim, .."&lt;/ref&gt;

A standard work is the ''Corpus Papyrorum Judaicarum'' of [[Victor Tcherikover]] and [[Alexander Fuks]] (Cambridge, Massachusetts Vol.I 1957, II 1960, III ed. [[Menahem Stern]] 1964) which is largely of Greek language papyri but includes examples of Hebrew and Aramaic papyri from Israel, Jordan, and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt: Geschichte und Kultur'' Volume 1 - Page 3428 Hildegard Temporini - 1973 "Examples of Hebrew papyri from Egypt are also noted by V. TCHERIKOVER and A. FUKS, Corpus Papyrorum Judaicarum I, Cambridge [Mass.] 1957, 107-108, eg M.STEINSCHNEIDER, ZÄS 17 (1879) 93-96; PREISENDANZ, Papyrusfunde 138; P. Ant. 47-50;"&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Egypt==
In 1909 Joseph Offord remarks that Germany had acquired all the Hebrew papyri found in [[Upper Egypt]] the previous winter, but that many were still to be found. In 1966 the [[Bodleian Library]] possessed only four Hebrew and three Aramaic papyri.&lt;ref&gt;The Jewish quarterly review: Volume 16 Israel Abrahams, Claude Goldsmid Montefiore - 1966 "Although these cannot be said to have any great interest, Hebrew papyri are so few that perhaps no apology is needed for printing them. The Bodleian Library possesses only four Hebrew and three Aramaic pieces, one of which I have ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qumran==
{{main|Dead Sea scrolls}}
The main corpus, in terms of volume and significance, are the finds at [[Qumran]] (1948 onwards). Very few Biblical papyri (as opposed to scrolls) were found at Qumran.&lt;ref&gt;Semitic papyrology in context: a climate of creativity : papers ... - Page 96 Lawrence H. Schiffman - 2003  This is no coincidence, since this script is used mainly for Scripture (Torah and Job), and as very few biblical papyri are found at Qumran, paleo-Hebrew papyri are not expected. The scribal practices reflected in the Qumran papyri can&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aside from Qumran==
In January 1952 [[Gerald Lankester Harding]] and [[Roland de Vaux]] commenced excavations in four caves at [[Wadi Murabba'at]]. 173 documents were found.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish and Christian scripture as artifact and canon - Page 206 Craig A. Evans, H. Daniel Zacharias - 2009 "There are seven documents identified as letters (in Hebrew) from the period of the second revolt found among the 173 documents found at ..."&lt;/ref&gt; 1 Aramaic and 1 Greek papyri only were found at the Wadi Sdeir.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Fitzmyer]] ''A guide to the Dead Sea scrolls and related literature''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ancient texts for New Testament studies: a guide to the background  Craig A. Evans - 2005  Summaries of Wadi Sdeir Documents In 1952 some bedouin found written materials in caves in Nahal David. Scholars think that the site was the Cave of the Pool, in Wadi Sdeir, where in 1905 G. D. Sandel was taken by bedouin and where he ...&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960-1961 Yigael Yadin excavated Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic papyri from the "Cave of Letters" at [[Nahal Hever]] (classified by "XHev" manuscript numbers) among which there were 15 letters; 10 in Hebrew, 3 in Aramaic and 2 in Greek.

In 1962 further finds of 18 Aramaic papyri from Samaria were made in the [[Wadi Daliyeh]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible and archaeology'' [[John Arthur Thompson]] - 1973 "Hebrew Papyri from Samaria A remarkable collection of papyri evidently from Samaria came to light in 1°62.25 Ta'amireh Bedouin discovered the documents in a cave in a desolate area north of Jericho in the Wadi Daliyeh."&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4 papyri from Nahal Se'elim (Wadi Seiyal) are in Greek.

==Inscriptions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}

The related area of inscriptions are documented in Jean Baptiste Frey, ''Corpus Inscriptionum Iudaicarum'', 2 vols. CII (Rome 1936–52) and other collections.

The '''Iberian Romance''', '''Ibero-Romance''' or simply '''Iberian languages'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David A. |last=Pharies|title=A Brief History of the Spanish Language|publisher= University of Chicago Press|year=2007 |page=13|isbn= 978-0-226-66683-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an areal grouping of [[Romance languages]] that developed on the [[Iberian Peninsula]], an area consisting primarily of [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Gibraltar]] and [[Andorra]], and in [[southern France]] which are today more commonly separated into [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian]] and [[Occitano-Romance]] language groups.

Originating in Iberia, the most widely spoken Iberian Romance languages are [[Spanish language|Castilian (Spanish)]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Galician language|Galician]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.org/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=size Ethnologue: Statistical Summaries]&lt;/ref&gt; These languages also have their own regional and local dialects. Based on [[mutual intelligibility]], Dalby counts seven "outer" languages, or language groups: [[Galician-Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Astur-Leonese]], "Wider"-[[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], "Wider"-[[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Occitan language|Provençal+Lengadocian]], and "Wider"-[[Gascon language|Gascon]].&lt;ref name=Dalby&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Dalby|year=2000|chapter=5=Indo-European phylosector|chapter-url=http://www.linguasphere.info/lcontao/tl_files/pdf/master/OL-SITE%201999-2000%20MASTER%20ONE%20Sectors%205-Zones%2050-54.pdf|title=The Linguasphere register of the world's languages and speech communities.|publisher=Observatoire Linguistique, Linguasphere Press|volume=2|location=Oxford|url=http://www.linguasphere.info/?page=chain&amp;id_chain=1017077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to those languages, there are a number of [[Portuguese-based creole languages]] and [[Spanish-based creole languages]], for instance [[Papiamento]].

==Origins and development==
[[Image:Linguistic map Southwestern Europe.gif|thumb|350px|Linguistic map of southwestern Europe]]
{{See also|History of the Spanish language|History of Portuguese|History of Catalan}}
Like all Romance languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sarah |last=Thomason|title=Language Contact|publisher= Georgetown University Press|year=2001 |page=263|isbn= 978-0-87840-854-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Iberian Romance languages descend from [[Vulgar Latin]]. Vulgar Latin was the nonstandard (in contrast to [[Classical Latin]]) form of the Latin language spoken by soldiers and merchants throughout the Roman Empire. With the [[Campaign history of the Roman military|expansion of the empire]], Vulgar Latin came to be spoken by inhabitants of the various Roman-controlled territories. Latin and its descendants have been spoken in Iberia since the [[Punic Wars]], when the Romans conquered the territory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Keith |last1=Brown |first2=Sarah |last2=Ogilvie |title=Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World|publisher=Elsevier Science|year=2008 |page=1020|isbn=978-0-08-087774-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Roman conquest of Hispania]]).

The modern Iberian Romance languages were formed roughly through the following process:
* The [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] of the local Iberian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Ralph |last=Penny|title= A History of the Spanish Language|publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2002 |page=8|isbn= 978-0-521-01184-6|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The diversification of Latin spoken in Iberia, with slight differences depending on location.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Penny|2002|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Development of [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]], [[Galician-Portuguese]], [[Astur-Leonese languages|Astur-Leonese]] and [[Navarro-Aragonese]] (the [[West Iberian languages]]) and early [[Catalan language|Catalan]] language from Latin between the eighth and tenth centuries. The genetic classification of early Catalan and Occitan is uncertain. Some scholars place it within Ibero-Romance (hence it would be '''East Iberian'''), others place it within Gallo-Romance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= M. Teresa |last=Turell|title=Multilingualism in Spain: Sociolinguistic and Psycholinguistic Aspects of Linguistic Minority Groups|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2001 |page=591|isbn=978-1-85359-491-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Fernando |last1=Cabo Aseguinolaza |first2=Anxo |last2=Abuín Gonzalez |first3=César |last3=Domínguez |title=A Comparative History of Literatures in the Iberian Peninsula|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2010 |pages=339–40|isbn=978-90-272-3457-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9NB0cialptcC&amp;pg=PA339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Rafael |last=Lapesa|title=Historia de la lengua española (7th ed.)|publisher=Gredos|year=1968 |page=124|isbn=84-249-0072-3 |language=es|id={{ISBN|84-249-0073-1}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Further development into modern Castilian, Portuguese, Galician, Catalan, Asturian, Leonese, Mirandese, etc. (see [[languages of Iberia]]: [[languages of Spain]], [[languages of Portugal]] and [[languages of Andorra]]) between the fifteenth and twentieth centuries.

== Common traits between Portuguese, Spanish and Catalan ==
This list points to common traits of these Iberian subsets, especially when compared to the other Romance languages in general. Thus, changes such as Catalan and Portuguese '''vuit''' and '''oito''' vs. Spanish '''ocho''' are not shown here, as the change -it- &gt; -ch- is exclusive to Spanish among the Romance languages.

=== Between Portuguese, Spanish and Catalan ===

==== Phonetic ====

* The length difference between r/rr is preserved through phonetic means, so that the second consonant in words such as '''caro''' and '''carro''' are not the same in any of the three.
* Latin U remains [u] and is not changed to [y].

=== Between Spanish and Catalan, but not Portuguese ===

==== Phonetic ====

* The length difference between n/nn is preserved through phonetic means, so that the second consonant in words such as '''año''' (Latin anno) and '''mano''' are not the same.
* The length difference between l/ll is preserved through phonetic means, so that the second consonant in words such as '''valle''' and '''vale''' are not the same. This also affects some initial L in Catalan.

=== Between Spanish and Portuguese, but not Catalan ===

==== Phonetic ====

* Initial Latin CL/FL/PL are palatalized further than in Italian, and become indistinguishable (to CH in Portuguese and LL in Spanish). 
* Final e/o remains (although its pronunciation changed in Portuguese, and modern European Portuguese drops final E).

==== Grammatical ====

* The synthetic preterite, inherited from earlier stages of Latin, remains the main past tense.

=== Between Portuguese and Catalan, but not Spanish ===

==== Phonetic ====

* Velarized L [ɫ], which [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|existed]] in Latin, is preserved at the end of syllables, and was later generalized to all positions in most dialects of both languages.
* Stressed Latin e/o, both open and closed, is preserved so and does not become a [[diphthong]]. 

==Statuses==
Politically (not linguistically), there are four major officially recognised Iberian Romance languages:
* '''Castilian''', better known overseas as '''Spanish''' (see [[names given to the Spanish language]]), is the national and [[official language]] of [[List of countries where Spanish is an official language|21 countries]], including Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Promotora Española de Lingüística |url=http://www.proel.org/index.php?pagina=mundo/indoeuro/italico/romance/iberorromance/espanol |title=Lengua Española o Castellana |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish is the [[List of languages by total number of speakers|fourth-most widely spoken]] language in the world, with over 570 total million speakers, and the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|second-most widely spoken ''native'' language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.org/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=size#3 Ethnologue: Table 3. Languages with at least 3 million first-language speakers]&lt;/ref&gt; It has a number of [[Spanish dialects and varieties|dialects and varieties]].
* '''Portuguese''', official language in [[List of territorial entities where Portuguese is an official language|eight countries]] including Portugal and [[Brazil]]. After Spanish, Portuguese is the second most widely spoken Romance language in the world with over 250 million speakers, currently ranked seventh by number of native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;See Ethnologue&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[Portuguese dialects]] exist outside of the [[European Portuguese|European standard]] spoken in Portugal.
* '''Catalan''' is the official language in [[Andorra]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andorramania.com/constit_gb.htm Constitution of Andorra] (Article 2.1)&lt;/ref&gt; and co-official in the Spanish autonomous communities of [[Catalonia]], [[Balearic Islands]] and [[Valencian Community]] (where it is known as '''[[Valencian]]'''), and the [[Italy|Italian]] city of [[Alghero]]. It is also spoken in the French department of [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] ([[Northern Catalonia]]) without official recognition. Catalan is closely related to [[Occitan language|Occitan]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Bec|Bec, Pierre]] (1973), ''Manuel pratique d'occitan moderne'', coll. Connaissance des langues, Paris: Picard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sumien, Domergue (2006), ''La standardisation pluricentrique de l'occitan: nouvel enjeu sociolinguistique, développement du lexique et de la morphologie'', coll. Publications de l'Association Internationale d'Études Occitanes, Turnhout: Brepols&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Carol |last=Myers-Scotton|title=Multiple Voices: An Introduction to Bilingualism|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2005 |page=57|isbn=978-0-631-21937-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the two languages having been treated as one in studies by Occitanist linguists (such as [[Pierre Bec]], or more recently Domergue Sumien). When not treated as one, the two languages are widely classified together as [[Occitano-Romance languages]], a group which is itself sometimes grouped with the [[Gallo-Romance languages]]. Catalan has two main dialectal branches (Eastern and Western Catalan) and several subdialects, and is spoken by about 10 million people (ranking the seventy-fifth most spoken language in the world),&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;Ethnologue&lt;/ref&gt; mostly in five variants: [[Central Catalan]], [[Northern Catalan]], [[Northwestern Catalan]], [[Valencian]] and [[Balearic dialect|Balearic]].
* '''Galician''', co-official in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and also spoken in adjacent western parts of [[Asturias]] and [[Castile and León]]. Closely related to Portuguese, and to an extent Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rebecca |last=Posner |authorlink=Rebecca Posner |title=The Romance Languages|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996 |page=57|isbn=978-0-521-28139-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shares origins with Portuguese, from the medieval [[Galician-Portuguese]]. Modern Galician is spoken by around 3.2&amp;nbsp;million people and is ranked 160th by number of speakers.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"/&gt;

Additionally, the [[Asturian language]], although not an official language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.elcomerciodigital.com/gijon/20090112/local/asturias/miembro-andecha-astur-enfrenta-200901121726.html |title=La jueza a Fernando González: 'No puede usted hablar en la lengua que le dé la gana' |work=El Comercio |date=12 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is recognised by the [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Asturias]]. In Portugal, [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]], which, like Asturian, is one of the Astur-Leonese languages, has official status in the northernmost part of the country.&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/document/asturia/an/i1/i1.html Euromosaic report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iberian Romance languages are a conventional group of Romance languages. Many authors use the term in a geographical sense although they are not necessarily a phylogenetic group (the languages grouped as Iberian Romance may not all directly descend from a common ancestor). Phylogenetically, there is disagreement about what languages should be considered within the Iberian Romance group; for example, some authors consider that East Iberian, also called Occitano-Romance, could be more closely related to languages of northern Italy (or also Franco-Provençal, the langues d'oïl and Rhaeto-Romance). A common conventional geographical grouping is the following:

*East Iberian
*West Iberian

An '''ideology''' is a collection of [[normative]] [[beliefs]] and [[values]] that an individual or group holds for other than purely [[epistemic]] reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Honderich |first1=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |date=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-866132-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by [[Antoine Destutt de Tracy]] in 1796, who conceived it as the "science of ideas". In contemporary philosophy it is narrower in scope than that original concept, or the ideas expressed in broad concepts such as ''[[worldview]]'', ''[[imaginary (sociology)|imaginary]]'' and ''[[ontology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2013 |last1=Steger |first1=Manfred B. |last2=James |first2=Paul |authorlink2=Paul James (academic) |title=Levels of Subjective Globalization: Ideologies, Imaginaries, Ontologies |url=https://www.academia.edu/4311113 |journal=Perspectives on Global Development and Technology |volume=12 |issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the political world, for instance, there are many well-known [[List of political ideologies|political ideologies]], which cover a wide range of human interests.

In the sense defined by French Marxist philosopher [[Louis Althusser]], ideology is "the imagined existence (or idea) of things as it relates to the real conditions of existence".

==Etymology and history==
[[File:Destutt de Tracy.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Destutt de Tracy]] (1754-1836)]]
The term "ideology" was born during the [[Reign of Terror]] of [[French Revolution]], and acquired several other meanings thereafter.

The word, and the system of ideas associated with it, was coined by [[Antoine Destutt de Tracy]] in 1796,&lt;ref name = hart&gt;{{cite web|last = Hart|first = David M. |date = 1 January 2002|url = http://www.econlib.org/library/Tracy/DestuttdeTracyBio.html |title = Life and Works of Antoine Louis Claude, Comte Destutt de Tracy|website = Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he was in prison pending trial during the Terror. The word was created by assembling the words [[idea#John Locke|''idea'']], from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἰδέα|ἰδέα]]}} (near to the [[John Locke|Lockean]] sense) and ''[[-logy]]'', from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]]}}.

The coup that overthrew [[Maximilien Robespierre]] allowed Tracy to pursue his work.&lt;ref name = kennedy&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kennedy |first=Emmet |date=Jul–Sep 1979 |title="Ideology" from Destutt De Tracy to Marx |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=353–368 |jstor=2709242 |doi=10.2307/2709242|bibcode=1961JHI....22..215C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = hart/&gt;

Tracy reacted to the terroristic phase of the revolution by trying to work out a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational mob impulses that had nearly destroyed him.  He devised the term for a "science of ideas" he hoped would form a secure foundation for the moral and political sciences. He based the word on two things:  1) sensations people experience as they interact with the material world; and 2) the ideas that form in their minds due to those sensations. He conceived "Ideology" as a [[liberalism|liberal]] philosophy that would defend individual liberty, property,  [[free markets]], and constitutional limits on state power.  He argues that among these aspects ideology is the most generic term, because the science of ideas also contains the study of their expression and deduction.&lt;ref name = kennedy/&gt;

Tracy worked this out during the Napoleonic regime, and [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] came to view 'Ideology' a term of abuse, which he often hurled against his liberal foes in Tracy's [[Institut National]]. According to [[Karl Mannheim]]'s historical reconstruction of the shifts in the meaning of ideology, the modern meaning of the word was born when Napoleon used it to describe his opponents as "the ideologues". [[Karl Marx]] adopted this negative sense of the term and used it in his writings (he described Tracy as a "fischblütige Bourgeoisdoktrinär", a fishblooded bourgeois doctrinaire).&lt;ref&gt;De Tracy, Destutt (1801) ''Les Éléments d'idéologie'', 3rd ed. (1817), p. 4, cited by: Mannheim, Karl (1929) Ideologie und Utopie, 2nd footnote in the chapter ''The problem of "false consciousness"''&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracy's major book, ''[[The Elements of Ideology]]'', was soon translated into the major languages of Europe, and in the next generation, when post-Napoleonic governments adopted a reactionary stance, influenced the Italian, Spanish and Russian thinkers who had begun to describe themselves as "liberals" and who attempted to reignite revolutionary activity in the early 1820s (these included the Carlist rebels in Spain, the Carbonari societies in France and Italy, and the Decembrists in Russia).

In the century after Tracy, the term ideology moved back and forth between positive and negative connotations.

(Perhaps the most accessible source for the near-original meaning of ''ideology'' is [[Hippolyte Taine]]'s work on the [[Ancien Régime]] (the first volume of "Origins of Contemporary France"). He describes ideology as rather like teaching philosophy by the [[Socratic method]], but without extending the vocabulary beyond what the general reader already possessed, and without the examples from observation that practical science would require. Taine identifies it not just with Destutt De Tracy, but also with his milieu, and includes [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]] as one of its precursors. (Destutt de Tracy read the works of Locke and Condillac while he was imprisoned during the [[Reign of Terror]].))

The term "ideology" has [[Euphemism#Euphemism treadmill|dropped some of its pejorative sting]], and has become a neutral term in the analysis of differing political opinions and views of social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry (1991) ''Ideology. An introduction'', Verso, pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Karl Marx]] situated the term within [[class struggle]] and domination,&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Robert C (1978). ''The Marx-Engels Reader'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''MER'', pg. 154&lt;/ref&gt; others believed it was a necessary part of [[structural functionalism|institutional functioning]] and [[social cohesion|social integration]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Silbey, [http://www.credoreference.com/entry/cupsoc/ideology "Ideology"] at ''Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
There has been considerable analysis of different ideological patterns. Some have described this kind of analysis as ''meta-ideology''—the study of the structure, form, and manifestation of ideologies. Recent analysis tends to posit that ideology is a ''coherent system of ideas'' that rely on a few basic assumptions about reality that may or may not have any factual basis. Ideas become ideologies (that is, become coherent, repeated patterns) through the subjective ongoing choices that people make, serving as the seed around which further thought grows. According to most recent analysis, ideologies are neither necessarily right nor wrong. Believers in ideology range from passive acceptance through fervent advocacy to true belief.

This accords with definitions, such as by [[Manfred Steger]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]], that emphasize both the issue of patterning and contingent claims to truth:

{{quote|Ideologies are patterned clusters of normatively imbued ideas and concepts, including particular representations of power relations. These conceptual maps help people navigate the complexity of their political universe and carry claims to social truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2010 |last1=James |first1=Paul |authorlink=Paul James (academic) |last2=Steger |first2=Manfred |title=Globalization and Culture, Vol. 4: Ideologies of Globalism |url=https://www.academia.edu/4510893 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The works of George Walford and Harold Walsby, done under the heading of [[systematic ideology]], are attempts to explore the relationships between ideology and social systems. [[Charles Blattberg]] offers an account that distinguishes political ideologies from political philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;Blattberg, Charles, "Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies", in ''Patriotic Elaborations: Essays in Practical Philosophy'', Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2009.[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1755117]&lt;/ref&gt;

David W. Minar describes six different ways the word "ideology" has been used:
# As a collection of certain ideas with certain kinds of ''content'', usually normative
# As the ''form or internal logical structure'' that ideas have within a set
# By the role ideas play in ''human-social interaction''
# By the role ideas play in the ''structure of an organization''
# As meaning, whose purpose is ''persuasion''
# As the ''locus'' of social interaction

For Willard A. Mullins an ideology should be contrasted with the related (but different) issues of ''utopia'' and ''historical myth''. An ideology is composed of four basic characteristics:
# it must have power over cognition
# it must be capable of guiding one's evaluations;
# it must provide guidance towards action; and
# it must be logically coherent.

[[Terry Eagleton]] outlines (more or less in no particular order) some definitions of ideology:&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry (1991) ''Ideology: An Introduction'', Verso, {{ISBN|0-86091-319-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The process of production of meanings, signs and values in social life
# A body of ideas characteristic of a particular social group or class
# Ideas that help legitimate a dominant political power
# False ideas that help legitimate a dominant political power
# Systematically distorted communication
# Ideas that offer a position for a subject
# Forms of thought motivated by social interests
# Identity thinking
# Socially necessary illusion
# The conjuncture of discourse and power
# The medium in which conscious social actors make sense of their world
# Action-oriented sets of beliefs
# The confusion of linguistic and phenomenal reality
# Semiotic closure
# The indispensable medium in which individuals live out their relations to a social structure
# The process that converts social life to a natural reality

The German philosopher [https://web.archive.org/web/20110701015904/http://www.ideologieforschung.de/web/Christian_Duncker.html Christian Duncker] called for a "critical reflection of the ideology concept" (2006). In his work, he strove to bring the concept of ideology into the foreground, as well as the closely connected concerns of [[epistemology]] and history. In this work, the term ideology is defined in terms of a system of presentations that explicitly or implicitly claim to absolute truth.

There are many different kinds of ideologies: [[politics|political]], [[Social issues|social]], [[epistemological]], and [[ethics|ethical]].

===Marxist view===
[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Karl Marx]] posits that a society's dominant ideology is integral to its superstructure.]]
In the [[Marxist]] [[base and superstructure (Marxism)|economic base and superstructure]] model of society, ''base'' denotes the [[relations of production]] and [[modes of production]], and ''superstructure'' denotes the dominant ideology (religious, legal, political systems). The economic base of production determines the political superstructure of a society. Ruling class-interests determine the superstructure and the nature of the justifying ideology—actions feasible because the ruling class control the means of production. For example, in a [[feudal]] [[mode of production]], religious ideology is the most prominent aspect of the superstructure, while in capitalist formations, ideologies such as [[liberalism]] and [[social democracy]] dominate. Hence the great importance of the ideology justifying a society; it politically confuses the alienated groups of society via [[false consciousness]].

Some explanations have been presented. [[György Lukács]] proposes ideology as a [[psychological projection|projection]] of the [[class consciousness]] of the ruling class. [[Antonio Gramsci]] uses [[cultural hegemony]] to explain why the [[working-class]] have a false ideological conception of what are their best interests. Marx argued that "The class which has the means of material production at its disposal has control at the same time over the means of mental production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|title="The Civil War in France", The Marx-Engels Reader 2nd ed.|year=1978a|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marxist formulation of "ideology as an instrument of social reproduction" is conceptually important to the [[sociology of knowledge]],&lt;ref&gt;In this discipline, there are lexical disputes over the meaning of the word "ideology" ("false consciousness" as advocated by Marx, or rather "false position" of a statement in itself is correct but irrelevant in the context in which it is produced, as in [[Max Weber]]'s opinion): {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Eleggibilità più ampia senza i paletti del peculato d'uso? Un'occasione (perduta) per affrontare il tema delle leggi ad personam |journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia Edizione Online |date=2005| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89394794}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; viz. [[Karl Mannheim]], [[Daniel Bell]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]] et al. Moreover, Mannheim has developed, and progressed, from the "total" but "special" Marxist conception of ideology to a "general" and "total" ideological conception acknowledging that all ideology (including [[Marxism]]) resulted from social life, an idea developed by the [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. [[Slavoj Žižek]] and the earlier [[Frankfurt School]] added to the "general theory" of ideology a psychoanalytic insight that ideologies do not include only conscious, but also [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] ideas.

===Louis Althusser's ideological state apparatuses===
[[Louis Althusser]] proposed both spiritual and materialistic conception of ideology, which made use of a special type of discourse: the [[lacunar discourse]]. A number of propositions, which are never untrue, suggest a number of other propositions, which are. In this way, the essence of the lacunar discourse is what is ''not'' told (but is suggested).

For example, the statement "All are equal before the law," which is a theoretical groundwork of current legal systems, suggests that all people may be of equal worth or have equal "opportunities". This is not true, for the concept of [[private property]] and power over the [[means of production]] results in some people being able to own more (''much'' more) than others. This power disparity contradicts the claim that all share both practical worth and future opportunity equally; for example, the rich can afford better legal representation, which practically privileges them before the law.

Althusser also proffered the concept of the [[ideological state apparatus]] to explain his theory of ideology. His first thesis was "''ideology has no history''": while individual ideolog''ies'' have histories, interleaved with the general class struggle of society, the general form of ideology is external to history.

For Althusser, beliefs and ideas are the products of social practices, not the reverse. His thesis that "''ideas are material''" is illustrated by the "scandalous advice" of [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] toward unbelievers: "Kneel and pray, and then you will believe." What is ultimately ideological for Althusser are not the subjective beliefs held in the conscious "minds" of human individuals, but rather discourses that produce these beliefs, the material institutions and rituals that individuals take part in without submitting it to conscious examination and so much more [[critical thinking]].

===Ideology and the Commodity in the works of Guy Debord===
The French [[Marxist]] theorist [[Guy Debord]], founding member of the [[Situationist International]], argued that when the commodity becomes the "essential category" of society, i.e. when the process of [[commodification]] has been consummated to its fullest extent, the image of society propagated by the commodity (as it describes all of life as constituted by notions and objects deriving their value only as commodities tradeable in terms of [[exchange value]]), colonizes all of life and reduces society to a mere representation, [[The Society of the Spectacle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Society of the Spectacle|publisher=Zone Books|author=Guy Debord|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silvio Vietta: ideology and rationality===
{{Disputed section|date=July 2015}}
The German [[cultural historian]] [[Silvio Vietta]] described the development and expansion of Western rationality from ancient times onwards as often accompanied by and shaped by ideologies like that of the "just war", the "true religion", racism, nationalism, or the vision of future history as a kind of heaven on earth in communism. He said that ideas like these became ideologies by giving hegemonic political actions an idealistic veneer and equipping their leaders with a higher and, in the "[[political religion]]s" ([[Eric Voegelin]]), nearly God-like power, so that they became masters over the lives (and the deaths) of millions of people. He considered that ideologies therefore contributed to power politics irrational shields of ideas beneath which they could operate as manifestations of idealism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Theory of Global Civilization: Rationality and the Irrational as the Driving Forces of History|publisher=Kindle Ebooks|author=Silvio Vietta|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rationalität. Eine Weltgeschichte. Europäische Kulturgeschichte und Globalisierung|publisher=Fink|author=Silvio Vietta|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eric Hoffer:  unifying agents===
The American philosopher [[Eric Hoffer]] identified several elements that unify followers of a particular ideology:&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 91 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
1) Hatred:  "Mass movements can rise and spread without a God, but never without belief in a devil.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "ideal devil" is a foreigner.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

2) Imitation:  "The less satisfaction we derive from being ourselves, the greater is our desire to be like others ... the more we mistrust our judgment and luck, the more are we ready to follow the example of others."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 101-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

3) Persuasion:  The proselytizing zeal of propagandists derives from "a passionate search for something not yet found more than a desire to bestow something we already have."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

4) Coercion:  Hoffer asserts that violence and fanaticism are interdependent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  People forcibly converted to Islamic or communist beliefs become as fanatical as those who did the forcing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 107–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  "It takes fanatical faith to rationalize our cowardice."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

5) Leadership:  Without the leader, there is no movement.  Often the leader must wait long in the wings until the time is ripe.  He calls for sacrifices in the present, to justify his vision of a breathtaking future.  The skills required include:  audacity, brazenness, iron will, fanatical conviction; passionate hatred, cunning, a delight in symbols; ability to inspire blind faith in the masses and a group of able lieutenants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 112-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Charlatanism is indispensable, and the leader often imitates both friend and foe, "a single-minded fashioning after a model."  He will not lead followers towards the "promised land," but only "away from their unwanted selves."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 116-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

6) Action:  Original thoughts are suppressed, and unity encouraged, if the masses are kept occupied through great projects, marches, exploration and industry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 120-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

7) Suspicion:  "There is prying and spying, tense watching and a tense awareness of being watched."  This pathological mistrust goes unchallenged and encourages conformity, not dissent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ronald Inglehart===

[[Ronald Inglehart]] of the University of Michigan is author of the [[World Values Survey]], which, since 1980, has mapped social attitudes in 100 countries representing 90% of global population. Results indicate that where people live is likely to closely correlate with their ideological beliefs. In much of Africa, South Asia and the Middle East, people prefer traditional beliefs and are less tolerant of liberal values. Protestant Europe, at the other extreme, adheres more to secular beliefs and liberal values. Alone among high-income countries, the United States is exceptional in its adherence to traditional beliefs, in this case Christianity.

==Political ideologies==&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Charles de Gaulle]]--&gt;
{{See also|List of political ideologies}}
In [[social studies]], a political ideology is a certain ethical set of [[ideal (ethics)|ideals]], principles, [[doctrine]]s, [[mythology|myths]], or [[symbol]]s of a [[social movement]], [[institution]], [[social class|class]], or large group that explains how society should work, and offers some political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order. Political ideologies are concerned with many different aspects of a society, including (for example): the economy, [[education]], [[health care]], [[labor law]], [[criminal law]], the [[justice system]], the provision of [[social security]] and [[social welfare]], [[trade]], the [[environmentalism|environment]], [[minor (law)|minors]], [[immigration]], [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], use of the [[military]], [[patriotism]], and [[established religion]].

Political ideologies have two dimensions:
# Goals: how society should work
# Methods: the most appropriate ways to achieve the ideal arrangement

There are many proposed methods for the classification of political ideologies, each of these different methods generate a specific [[political spectrum]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Ideologies also identify themselves by their position on the [[political spectrum]] (such as the [[left-wing politics|left]], the [[center (politics)|center]] or the [[right-wing politics|right]]), though precision in this respect can very often become controversial. Finally, ideologies can be distinguished from [[political strategy|political strategies]] (e.g., [[populism]]) and from single issues that a party may be built around (e.g. [[Marijuana political parties|legalization of marijuana]]). Philosopher Michael Oakeshott provides a good definition of ideology as "the formalized abridgment of the supposed sub-stratum of the rational truth contained in the tradition".

A political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate [[power (sociology)|power]] and to what ends power should be used. Some parties follow a certain ideology very closely, while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them. Each political ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers the best [[form of government]] (e.g., [[democracy]], [[demagogy]], [[theocracy]], [[caliphate]] etc.), and the best [[economic system]] (e.g. [[capitalism]], [[socialism]], etc.). Sometimes the same word is used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas. For instance, "socialism" may refer to an economic system, or it may refer to an ideology that supports that economic system.

Studies of the concept of ideology itself (rather than specific ideologies) have been carried out under the name of [[systematic ideology]].

Post 1991, many commentators claim that we are living in a post-ideological age,&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Bell|Bell, D.]] ''[[The End of Ideology|The End of Ideology: On the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties]] (2000) (2nd ed.). Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, pg. 393''&lt;/ref&gt; in which redemptive, all-encompassing ideologies have failed, and this view is often associated{{by whom|date=August 2015}} with [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s writings on "the end of history".&lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama, F. (1992)''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''. USA: The Free Press, xi&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Nienhueser sees research (in the field of [[human resource management]]) as ongoingly "generating ideology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nienhueser |first1=Werner |year=2011 |title=Empirical Research on Human Resource Management as a Production of Ideology |url=http://www.management-revue.org/papers/mrev_4_11_Nienhueser.pdf |journal=Management Revue |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=367–393 |doi=10.1688/1861-9908_mrev_2011_04_Nienhueser |issn=0935-9915 |access-date=2015-08-27 |quote=[...] current empirical research in HRM is generating ideology.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slavoj Zizek]] has pointed out how the very notion of post-ideology can enable the deepest, blindest form of ideology. A sort of false consciousness or false cynicism, engaged in for the purpose of lending one's point of view the respect of being objective, pretending neutral cynicism, without truly being so. Rather than help avoiding ideology, this lapse only deepens the commitment to an existing one. Zizek calls this "a post-modernist trap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zizek |first=Slavoj |date=2008 |title=The Sublime Object of Ideology |edition=2nd |publisher=[[London: Verso]]|pages =xxxi, 25–27 |isbn=9781844673001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Sloterdijk]] advanced the same idea already in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sloterdijk |first=Peter |date=1988 |title=Critique of Cynical Reason |publisher=[[US: University of Minnesota Press]] |isbn=9780816615865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government ideology===
When a political ideology becomes a dominantly pervasive component within a government, one can speak of an [[ideocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Politics_of_ideocracy.html?id=xC6FAAAAMAAJ |title=Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz, Alfred Wayne Penn. Politics of Ideocracy|isbn=9780791422977|last1=Piekalkiewicz|first1=Jaroslaw|last2=Penn|first2=Alfred Wayne|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms of government utilize ideology in various ways, not always restricted to politics and society. Certain ideas and schools of thought become favored, or rejected, over others, depending on their compatibility with or use for the reigning social order.

===Implementation===

"Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back", said [[John Maynard Keynes]].&lt;ref&gt;The General Theory, p383-4&lt;/ref&gt; How do ideologies become part of government policy?
In ''[[The Anatomy of Revolution]]'', [[Crane Brinton]] said that new ideology spreads when there is discontent with the old regime.&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; Extremists such as [[Lenin]] and [[Robespierre]] will overcome more moderate revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, CH 6&lt;/ref&gt;  This stage is soon followed by [[Thermidor]], a reining back of revolutionary enthusiasm under pragmatists like [[Stalin]] and [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] who bring "normalcy and equilibrium".&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, CH 8&lt;/ref&gt;
A very similar sequence  ("men of ideas&gt;fanatics&gt;practical men of action") occurs in [[Eric Hoffer]], [[The True Believer]],&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, chapters 15, 16,17&lt;/ref&gt; and Brinton's sequence is reiterated by [[J. William Fulbright]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulbright, The Arrogance of Power, 1967, chapters 3-7&lt;/ref&gt;
The revolution thus becomes established as an [[Ideocracy]], but its rise is likely to be checked by a [[Political midlife crisis]].

==Epistemological ideologies==
Even when the challenging of existing beliefs is encouraged, as in scientific theories, the dominant [[paradigm]] or [[mindset]] can prevent certain challenges, theories, or experiments from being advanced.

A special case of science adopted as ideology is that of ecology, which studies the relationships among living things on Earth. [[Perceptual psychology|Perceptual psychologist]] [[James J. Gibson]] believed that human perception of ecological relationships was the basis of [[self-awareness]] and [[cognition]] itself. [[Linguistics|Linguist]] [[George Lakoff]] has proposed a [[cognitive science of mathematics]] wherein even the most fundamental ideas of arithmetic would be seen as consequences or products of human perception—which is itself necessarily evolved within an ecology.

[[Deep ecology]] and the modern [[ecology movement]] (and, to a lesser degree, [[Green parties]]) appear to have adopted ecological sciences as a positive ideology.

Some accuse [[ecological economics]] of likewise turning scientific theory into [[political economy]], although theses in that science can often be tested. The modern practice of [[green economics]] fuses both approaches and seems to be part science, part ideology.

This is far from the only theory of economics raised to ideology status. Some notable economically based ideologies include [[neoliberalism]], [[monetarism]], [[mercantilism]], [[mixed economy]], [[social Darwinism]], [[communism]], [[laissez-faire|laissez-faire economics]], and [[free trade]]. There are also current theories of [[safe trade]] and [[fair trade]] that can be seen as ideologies.

==Psychological research==
Psychological research&lt;ref name="jost2008"/&gt; increasingly suggests that ideologies reflect (unconscious) motivational processes, as opposed to the view that political convictions always reflect independent and unbiased thinking. Jost, Ledgerwood and Hardin proposed in 2008 that ideologies may function as prepackaged units of interpretation that spread because of basic human motives to understand the world, avoid existential threat, and maintain valued interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="jost2008"&gt;Jost, John T., Ledgerwood, Alison, &amp; Hardin, Curtis D. (2008). "Shared reality, system justification, and the relational basis of ideological beliefs." ''Social and Personality Psychology Compass'', 2, 171–186&lt;/ref&gt; These authors conclude that such motives may lead disproportionately to the adoption of [[system justification|system-justifying]] worldviews. Psychologists have generally found that [[personality traits]], individual difference variables, needs, and ideological beliefs seem to have a common thread.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Ideology and semiotic theory==
According to the semiotician [[Bob Hodge (linguist)|Bob Hodge]], ideology "identifies a unitary object that incorporates complex sets of meanings with the social agents and processes that produced them. No other term captures this object as well as 'ideology'. [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s '[[episteme]]' is too narrow and abstract, not social enough. His 'discourse', popular because it covers some of ideology's terrain with less baggage, is too confined to verbal systems. 'Worldview' is too metaphysical, 'propaganda' too loaded. Despite or because of its contradictions, 'ideology' still plays a key role in semiotics oriented to social, political life."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bob Hodge (linguist)|Bob Hodge]], [http://www.semioticon.com/seo/I/ideology.html# "Ideology"], at ''Semiotics Encyclopedia Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; Authors such as [[Michael Freeden]] have also recently incorporated a [[semantics|semantic]] analysis to the study of ideologies.

== Sociological uses ==
Sociologists define ideology as "cultural beliefs that justify particular social arrangements, including patterns of inequality."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociology|last=Macionis|first=John J.|date=2010|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9780205749898|edition=13th|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|pages=257|oclc=468109511}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dominant groups use these sets of cultural beliefs and practices to justify the systems of inequality that maintain their group's social power over non-dominant groups. Ideologies use a society's symbol system to organize social relations in a [[hierarchy]], with some social identities being superior to other social identities, which are considered inferior. The dominant ideology in a society is passed along through the society's major social institutions, such as the media, the family, education, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 2018|last=Witt|first=Jon|publisher=MCGRAW-HILL|year=2017|isbn=978-1259702723|edition=5TH|location=[S.l.]|pages=65|oclc=968304061}}&lt;/ref&gt; As societies changed throughout history, so did the ideologies that justified systems of inequality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sociological examples of ideologies include: [[racism]]; [[sexism]]; [[heterosexism]]; [[ableism]]; and [[ethnocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 2018|last=Witt|first=John|publisher=MCGRAW-HILL|year=2017|isbn=978-1259702723|edition=5TH|location=[S.l.]|pages=|oclc=968304061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iraqw''' is a [[Cushitic language]] spoken in [[Tanzania]] in the [[Arusha Region|Arusha]] and [[Manyara Region|Manyara]] Regions. It is expanding in numbers as the [[Iraqw people]] absorb neighbouring ethnic groups. The language has a large number of [[Datooga language|Datooga]] loanwords, especially in poetic language. The [[Gorowa language]] to the south shares numerous similarities and is sometimes considered a dialect.

==Morphology==

===Noun morphology===

====Gender====
Nouns in Iraqw have three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter.  The gender of a noun can be deduced from the type of agreement that it triggers on other elements in the sentence, but the agreement system is unusual, and obeys the following principle (Mous 1993:41):

* Masculine nouns require the masculine form of the verb
* Feminine nouns require the feminine form of the verb
* Neuter nouns require the plural form of the verb

The masculine, feminine, and plural forms of the verb are identified by the form the verb takes when the subject is pronoun which is a.) a third person masculine singular ('he'), b.) a third person feminine singular ('she'), or c.) a third person plural ('they').

|-
|colspan='3'|'The tail is making circles'||||colspan='2'|'They are making circles'
|}

There are several unusual things that are worth noting.  One is that 'tail' is neuter in the singular and feminine in the plural; despite this, the plural verb form is used for 'tail', since it is neuter, and neuters use the plural verb form.  Another is that the verbs do not agree with their subjects in number, so the masculine plural ''daaqay'' 'boys' takes the masculine form of the verb, not the plural form of the verb.

====Number====

Nouns typically have separate singular and plural forms, but there are a large number of distinct plural suffixes.  Mous (1993:44) reports that there are fourteen different plural suffixes.  The lexical entry for a noun must specify the particular plural suffix it takes.

The gender of a plural noun is usually different from the gender of the corresponding singular. Compare the following singular and plural nouns, with their genders:

{| class='wikitable'
!singular!!singular gender!!plural!!plural gender!!meaning
|-
|awu||m||awe||f||bull
|-
|bila'||m||bil'aawe||f|| cliff
|-
|nyaqot||m||nyaqootma'||f||colobus monkey
|-
|hhampa||m||hhampeeri||n||wing
|-
|tlanka||f||tlankadu||n||bridge
|-
|lama||f||lameemo||n||lie
|-
|slanú||m||slaneemo||n||python
|-
|xweera||n||xweer(a)du||n||night
|}

While it is not possible to predict the gender of a noun or which plural suffix it will take, the form of the plural suffix determines the gender of the plural noun.  So, for example, all plural nouns with the /-eemo/ suffix are neuter (Mous 1993:58).

===Construct case suffixes and gender linkers===

The gender of a noun is important for predicting the construct case suffix and the gender linker that it will use.  When a noun is directly followed by
*an adjective
*a possessive noun phrase
*a numeral
*a relative clause
*a verb
then a '''construct case suffix''' must appear after the noun.  The construct case marker is /-ú/ or /-kú/ for masculine nouns; /-&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;r/ or /-tá/ for feminine nouns; and /-á/ for neuter nouns (Mous 1993:95-96):

{|class='wikitable'
|hhar-t'''á''' ||baabú-'ee'||
|-
|stick-construct:'''fem'''||father-1sgPoss||
|-
|colspan='3'|'the stick of my father'
|-
|colspan='3'| 
|-
|waahlá-'''r'''||ur||
|-
|python-construct:'''fem'''||big||
|-
|colspan='3'|'big python'
|-
|colspan='3'| 
|-
|an-á|| hiim-'''ú'''|| urúux
|-
|1sg-S:1/2||rope-construct:'''masc'''||pull:1sg
|-
|colspan='3'|'I pull the rope'
|}

The '''gender linkers''' are similar to the construct cases suffixes, but appear between the noun and other suffixes (such as the demonstrative, indefinite, and possessive suffixes).  The following example shows masculine, feminine, and neuter nouns before the 'their' possessive suffix and the demonstrative -qá' 'that (far, but visible)' (Mous 1993:90-92)

{| class='wikitable'
!masculine!!feminine!!neuter
|-
|gura' 'stomach'||hasam 'dilemma'||hhafeeto 'mats'
|-
|colspan='3'| 
|-
|gur'''u'''-'ín 'their stomach'||hasam-'''ar'''-'ín 'their dilemma'||hhafeeto-'ín
|-
|stomach:M-3plPoss||dilemma-F-3plPoss||mats:N-3plPoss
|-
|colspan='3'| 
|-
|gur'''u'''-qá' 'that stomach'||hasam-'''ar'''-qá' 'that dilemma'||hhafeeto-qá' 'those mats'
|-
|stomach:M-that||dilemma-F-that||mats:N-that
|}

==Syntax==

===Noun phrases===

The noun comes first in the noun phrase, and precedes possessors, adjectives, numerals, and relative clauses.  An element called the construct case suffix appears between the noun and these modifiers, as discussed in the Morphology section above:

{|class='wikitable'
|hhar-'''tá''' ||baabú-'ee'
|-
|stick-construct:'''fem'''||father-1sgPoss
|-
|colspan='2'|'the stick of my father'
|-
|colspan='2'| 
|-
|waahlá-'''r'''||ur
|-
|python-construct:'''fem'''||big
|-
|colspan='2'|'big python'
|}

===Sentences===
An Iraqw sentence contains a verb in final position, and an auxiliary-like element called the 'selector'.  Either the subject or the object of the sentence may precede the selector (Mous 2004:110), and the selector agrees with the preceding noun.  So in the first example below, ''iri'' shows agreement with ''/ameenirdá' '' 'that woman', and in the second example, ''uná'' shows agreement with ''gitladá' '':

{| class='wikitable'
|/ameeni-r-dá'||i-ri|| tsuwa||fa/á-r||/agagiin.
|-
|woman-F-that||3-narrative:past||for.sure||food-F:CON||eat:impf:3s
|-
|colspan='7'|'And that woman was surely eating.'
|}

{|class='wikitable'
|('aníng)||gitla-dá'||'u-na||aahhiit
|-
|I||man-that||obj:M-past||hate:1sg
|-
|colspan='7'|'I hate that man.'
|}

==Biography==
He was born on 6 July 1905 at Garani village near [[Jasdan]] in [[Amreli district]] than under [[Baroda State]] of [[Gujarat]] to Santokben and Bhavanishankar. He and his brother Durlabhji were introduced at the school in Panosara village. His father died when he was studying in the third standard. He went to [[Ahmedabad]] from [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] at early age. He was educated in [[Balwantray Thakore]]'s Proprietary School near [[Teen Darwaza]], Ahmedabad. He worked as cook at home of [[Ramnarayan V. Pathak]]. Inspired by the life of [[Dharmananda Damodar Kosambi]], he went to [[Varanasi|Kashi]] in North India. He studied [[Sanskrit]] and [[English language]]s in 1927 at Kashi. He was introduced to Kashi Vidyapith also. He was involved in [[Indian independence movement]].

The '''Kho-Bwa''' languages, also known as '''Bugunish''' and '''Kamengic''', are a small family of languages spoken in  [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Seven Sister States|northeast India]]. The name ''Kho-Bwa'' was originally proposed by [[George van Driem]] (2001). It is based on the reconstructed words ''*kho'' ("water") and ''*bwa'' ("fire"). Blench (2011) suggests the name ''Kamengic'', from the [[Kameng River|Kameng]] area of  Arunachal Pradesh, or alternatively ''Bugun–Mey'', after its two main members. Alternatively, Anderson (2014)&lt;ref name="Anderson2014"&gt;Anderson, Gregory D.S. 2014. ''On the classification of the Hruso (Aka) language''. Paper presented at the 20th Himalayan Languages Symposium, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to Kho-Bwa as '''Northeast Kamengic'''.

Both Van Driem and Blench group the [[Khowa language|''Bugun'' (or ''Khowa'')]], the [[Sherdukpen language|''Mey'' (or ''Sherdukpen'')]], and the [[Lishpa language|''Lishpa'' (or ''Lish'')]] languages. 
The [[Sulung language|''Puroik'' (or ''Sulung'')]] language is included in the group by Van Driem but treated as a [[language isolate]] with no genetic relation to Kamengic by Blench.

These languages have traditionally been placed in the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman group]] by the [[Linguistic Survey of India]], but the justification of this is open to question.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}
The languages have certainly been strongly influenced by the neighboring Sino-Tibetan languages, but this does not necessarily imply [[genetic (linguistics)|genetic]] unity and may possibly be a purely [[areal linguistics|areal]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;
Blench (2011): "Certainly, the phonology and  morphology of Arunachali languages looks superficially like Tibeto-Burman, which explains their placing in the Linguistic Survey of India. Unfortunately, this is rather where matters have remained [... this paper] proposes we should take seriously the underlying presumption probably implied in [[Sten Konow|Konow]]'s statement in Linguistic Survey of India. Volume III, 1, Tibeto-Burman family, Calcutta (1909:572)], that these languages may not be Sino-Tibetan but simply have been influenced by it; that they are language isolates."&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire language family has about 15,000 speakers (including Puroik) or about 10,000 speakers (excluding Puroik), according to estimates made during the 2000s.

==Classification==
The internal structure of the ''Kho-Bwa'' group of languages is as follows.
*[[Puroik language|Puroik]] (?)
*[[Bugun language|Bugun]] (Khowa)
*Western Kho-Bwa
**Mey–Sartang
*** [[Sherdukpen language|Sherdukpen]] (Mey, Ngnok), divided into two varieties:
**** Shergaon
**** Rupa
***[[Sartang language|Sartang]] (Bootpa, But Monpa, But Pa, Matchopa), 50%–60% lexical similarity with Mey.
**Chug–Lish
***[[Lish language|Lish]] (Lish)
***[[Chug language|Chug]] (Chug Monpa, Chugpa, Monpa), close to Lish

The '''Kru languages''' belong to the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo language family]] and are spoken by the [[Kru people]] from the southeast of [[Liberia]] to the east of [[Ivory Coast]].
The term "Kru" is of unknown origin. According to Westermann (1952) it was used by Europeans to denote a number of tribes speaking related dialects. Marchese (1989) notes the fact that many of these peoples were recruited as "crew" by European seafarers; "the homonymy with crew is obvious, and is at least one source of the confusion among Europeans that there was a Kru/crew tribe"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Andrew Dalby noted the historical importance of the Kru languages for their position at the crossroads of African-European interaction. He wrote that "Kru and associated languages were among the first to be encountered by European voyagers on what was then known as the [[Pepper Coast]], a centre of the production and export of [[Guinea pepper|Guinea]] and [[melegueta pepper]]; a once staple African seaborne trade".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kru languages are known for some of the most complex [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] systems in Africa, rivaled perhaps only by the [[Omotic languages]].

==Current status==

Recent documentation has noted "Kru societies can now be found along the coast of [[Monrovia]], [[Liberia]] to [[Bandama River]] in [[Côte d'Ivoire]]". &lt;ref name = EMW&gt;{{Cite book

In 2010, Kru and associated languages were spoken by 95 percent of the approximately 3.5 million people in Liberia.

==Subgroups and associated languages ==
The Kru languages include many subgroups such as [[Kuwaa language|Kuwaa]], [[Grebo language|Grebo]], Belle, Belleh, Kwaa and many others. According to Breitbonde, categorization of communities based on cultural distinctiveness, historical or ethnic identity, and socio-political autonomy "may have brought about the large number of distinct Kru dialects; "Although the natives were in many respects similar in type and tribe, every village was an independent state; there was also very little intercommunication".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

This is the possible reason for so many subgroups of the Kru language. As noted by Fisiak, there is very little documentation on the Kru and associated languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The Marchese (1989) classification of Kru languages is as follows. Many of these languages are [[dialect cluster]]s and are sometimes considered more than a single language.

'''Langscape''' is a term and concept affectively adapting and amending the word 'landscape' to emphasize worlds of 'languages' that are locally interlinked with the worlds 'landscapes' (see [[cultural landscapes]]) where people locally live, locally forming and locally speaking words across generations within those landscapes, being words and languages often particular to those landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maffi|first=Luisa|date=2005-09-16|title=Linguistic, cultural, and biological diversity|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.anthro.34.081804.120437|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=34|issue=1|pages=599–617|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.34.081804.120437|issn=0084-6570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term and concept first started to be more popularly promoted from June 1996 when an organization incorporated to coordinate partnerships aimed at better valuing, mapping, and conserving interlinked linguistic and biological diversity i.e. [[Terralingua]] adopted this term for its members newsletter and magazine Langscape.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.terralinguaubuntu.org/Langscape/home.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The term and concept is now also being used by a Language Science Center, the Maryland Language Science Center, for its own Langscape [[geographical information system]] mapping language diversity and the accumulated knowledge of over more than 6400 languages worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://langscape.umd.edu/about.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Based out of the [[University of Siegen]], [[Germany]], there is a European Language Acquisition and Language Learning network of Researchers for whom "..the nexus between language skills and the formation of social identity, plurilinguality and supranational identity is a key issue for Langscape researchers seeking to reflect languages' true geographical and linguistic diversity and range" (see [http://www.langscape.uni-bremen.de/index.html here])

Since Indonesia recognises only a single official language, other languages are not recognised either at the national level or the regional level, thus making [[Javanese language|Javanese]] the most widely spoken language [[List of languages without official status|without official status]], with Sundanese the second in the list (excluding Chinese varieties).

===Comparison chart===

====Indonesian languages====
Below is a chart of several Indonesian languages. Most of them belong to [[Austronesian languages]] family. While there have been misunderstandings on which ones should be classified as ''[[language]]s'' and which ones should be classified as ''[[dialect]]s'', the chart confirms that most have similarities, yet are not mutually comprehensible. These languages are arranged according to the numbers of native speakers.

==Challenges==
{{main|List of endangered languages in Indonesia}}
There are 726 languages spoken across the Indonesian archipelago in 2009 (dropped from 742 languages in 2007), the largest multilingual population in the world only after [[Languages of Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]]. Indonesian Papua, which is adjacent to Papua New Guinea, has the most languages in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/193847 |title=90 Persen Bahasa Ibu di Dunia Terancam Punah |date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the EGIDS classification used by [[Ethnologue]] (formerly the [[Summer Institute of Linguistics]]), 63 languages are dying (shown in red on the bar chart, subdivided into Moribund and Nearly Extinct, or Dormant), which is defined as "The only fluent users (if any) are older than child-bearing age, so it is too late to restore natural intergenerational transmission through the home."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethnologue.com/country/ID/status&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language education policy==
Indonesia's Minister of Education and Culture Muhammad Nuh affirmed in January 2013 that the teaching of local languages as school subjects will be part of the national education curriculum. Nuh stated that much of the public worry about the teaching of local languages being left out of the curriculum is misplaced and that the new curriculum will be conveyed to them.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.antaranews.com/berita/351761/pelajaran-bahasa-daerah-tetap-ada&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dutch language==
{{Further|Dutch language#Asia}}
Despite the Dutch presence in [[Indonesia]] for almost 350&amp;nbsp;years (parts of Indonesia were ruled by the [[Dutch East India Company]] and subsequently the whole of what is now Indonesia was in the [[Dutch East Indies]], the Dutch language has no official status there&lt;ref&gt;Baker (1998), p.202.&lt;/ref&gt; and the small minority that can speak the language fluently are either educated members of the oldest generation, or employed in the legal profession,&lt;ref&gt;Ammon (2005), p.2017.&lt;/ref&gt; as certain [[law code]]s are still only available in Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;Booij (1999), p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing system==
Indonesian languages are generally not rendered in native-invented systems, but in scripts devised by speakers of other languages, that is, [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Arabic]], and [[Latin]]. [[Malay language|Malay]], for example, has a long history as a written language and has been rendered in [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmic]], [[Arabic script|Arabic]], and [[Latin script|Latin]] scripts. [[Javanese language|Javanese]] has been written in the [[Pallava]] script of South India, as well as their derivative (known as [[Kawi script|Kawi]] and [[Javanese script|Javanese]]), in an Arabic alphabet called ''[[Pegon (language)|pegon]]'' that incorporates Javanese sounds, and in the Latin script.

Chinese characters have never been used to write Indonesian languages, although Indonesian place-names, personal names, and names of trade goods appear in reports and histories written for [[China]]'s imperial courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Taylor |first= Jean Gelman |title= Indonesia: Peoples and Histories |publisher= Yale University Press |year= 2003 |location = New Haven and London |isbn= 0-300-10518-5 |page= 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Isle of Man]], '''''longtail''''' is a [[euphemism]] used to denote a [[rat]], as a relatively modern superstition has arisen that it is considered bad luck to mention this word.  The origins of this [[superstition]] date to sea-[[taboo]]s, where certain words and practices were not mentioned aboard ship, for fear of attracting bad luck (or bad weather).&lt;ref&gt;Eyers, Jonathan (2011). ''Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions''. A&amp;C Black, London, UK. {{ISBN|978-1-4081-3131-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Manx Gaelic]] author [[Edward Faragher]] (also known by his Manx nickname 'Ned Beg Hom Ruy') recorded in his work 'Skeealyn 'sy Ghailck' that during his time working on fishing boats in the 19th century "It was forbidden to name a hare on board, or a rabbit, or a rat or a cat. The hare was 'the big-eared fellow', and the rabbit ‘pomet’, and the rat ‘sacote’, and the cat ‘scratcher'". In the modern superstition, the taboo only applies to the rat, and the term 'sacote' is no longer used. 
 
Although this particular sea-taboo was one amongst many and was not held to apply on land, it has become a popular modern belief that the word is somehow unlucky and the taboo has been adopted by some as a typical Manx practice, despite the fact that the old [[Manx people|Manx]] had no qualms in using the word, or its [[Manx language|Manx]] equivalent, "roddan". In modern times, even non-local and unsuperstitious people will refrain from using the word "rat" perhaps in an effort to fit in with those who take it seriously, or in an attempt to be folksy.

Local socially acceptable alternatives for the superstitious also include ''joey'', ''ringie'', ''queerfella'', ''iron fella'' and {{lang|gv|roddan}}. Recently young people have also begun saying ''r-a-t'', owing to the influence of [[England|English]] immigrants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Similar taboos can be found as far north as [[Shetland]]. Other sea taboos included [[pig]]s, [[cat]]s, and knives. There is a comparable and apparently also relatively modern taboo against uttering the word 'rabbit' on the [[Isle of Portland]].

&lt;/ref&gt;  Various forms of lustration were employed in [[post-communism|post-communist]] Europe.&lt;ref name="sites.google.com"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Roman David|title="Lustration Laws in Action: The Motives and Evaluation of Lustration Policy in the Czech Republic and Poland (1989-2001)|journal=Law &amp; Social Inquiry|volume=28 |issue=2|pages=387–439|date=2003|url=http://sites.google.com/site/roman328/home/LSIpaper.pdf?attredirects=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Egypt lustrating.jpg|thumb|Drawing of a relief from the [[Karnak temple]] in Egypt showing a [[pharaoh]] lustrating with incense]]
Lustration in general is the process of making something clear or pure, usually by means of a [[wikt:propitiatory|propitiatory]] offering. The term is taken from the Roman [[lustratio]] [[Ritual purification|purification rituals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Lustration |volume=17 |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policies and laws==
After the fall of the various European Communist governments in 1989–1991, the term came to refer to government-sanctioned policies of "mass disqualification of those associated with the abuses under the prior regime".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  Procedures excluded participation of former communists, and especially of informants of the communist secret police, in successor political positions, or even in civil service positions.  This exclusion formed part of the wider [[decommunization]] campaigns. In some countries, however, lustration laws did not lead to exclusion and disqualification. Lustration law in [[Hungary]] (1994–2003) was based on the exposure of compromised state officials, while lustration law in Poland (1999–2005) depended on confession.&lt;ref name="sites.google.com"/&gt;

Lustration law "is a special public employment law that regulates the process of examining whether a person holding certain higher public positions worked or collaborated with the repressive apparatus of the communist regime".&lt;ref name="sites.google.com"/&gt; The "special" nature of lustration law refers to its transitional character. 
As of 1996, various lustration laws of varying scope were implemented in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Baltic States]] ([[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], and [[Estonia]]), [[Germany]], [[Poland]], and [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Skeletons in the Closet: Transitional Justice in Post-Communist Europe|first=Monika|last=Nalepa|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1996 lustration laws had not been passed in [[Belarus]], nor in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]] or the former Soviet [[Central Asian Republics]] ([[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]]) (Ellis, 1996).

===Results===
Lustration can serve as a form of punishment by [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] politicians who were [[dissident]]s under a Communist-led government.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Lustration laws are usually passed right before elections, and become tightened when [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] governments are in power, and loosened while [[Social Democratic Party|social democratic parties]] are in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Retribution and Reparation in the Transition to Democracy|editor1-first=Jon|editor1-last=Elster|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that lustration systems based on dismissal or confession might be able to increase trust in government,&lt;ref name="Rom"&gt;Roman David, Lustration and Transitional Justice: Personnel Systems in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011, pp. 183, 209
&lt;/ref&gt; while those based on confession might be able to promote social reconciliation.&lt;ref name="Rom" /&gt;

==Examples==
===In Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic===
Unlike many neighbouring states, the new government in the [[Czech and Slovak Federative Republic]] did not adjudicate under [[court]] trials, but instead took a non-judicial approach to ensure changes would be implemented.

According to a law passed on 4 October 1991, all employees of the [[StB]], the Communist-era secret police, were blacklisted from designated public offices, including the upper levels of the civil service, the judiciary, procuracy, [[Security Information Service]] (BIS), army positions, management of state owned enterprises, the central bank, the railways, senior academic positions and the public electronic media. This law remained in place in the [[Czech Republic]] after the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]], and expired in 2000.

The lustration laws in Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic were not intended to serve as justice, but to ensure that events such as the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948|Communist coup of February 1948]] did not happen again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ce-review.org/99/19/williams19.html Kieran Williams, "Lustration"], ''Central Europe Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Germany===
{{Main |Stasi Records Agency}}
Germany did not have a lustration process, but it has a [[Federal agency (Germany)|federal agency]], known as the [[Stasi Records Agency]], dedicated to preserving and protecting the archives and investigating the past actions of the former East German secret police, the [[Stasi]]. The agency is subordinate to the Representative of the Federal Government for Culture ([[Bernd Neumann]], CDU). As of 2012, it had 1,708 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bstu.bund.de/DE/BundesbeauftragterUndBehoerde/BStUZahlen/_node.html |title=BStU - BStU in Zahlen |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 30 June 2013 |website= Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records |publisher= Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records |accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Poland===
{{Main |Lustration in Poland|Institute of National Remembrance}}
The first lustration bill was passed by the Polish [[Sejm|Parliament]] in 1992, but it was declared unconstitutional by the [[Constitutional Tribunal of the Republic of Poland]]. Several other projects were then submitted and reviewed by a dedicated commission, resulting in a new lustration law passed in 1996.&lt;ref name="Ellis_other_countries"&gt;Mark S. Ellis, [http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?59+Law+&amp;+Contemp.+Probs.+181+(Fall+1996)+pdf  ''Purging the past: The Current State of Lustration Laws in the Former Communist Bloc''] (pdf), Law and Contemporary Problems, Vol. 59, No. 4, Accountability for International Crimes and Serious Violations of Fundamental Human Rights (Autumn, 1996), pp. 181–96&lt;/ref&gt; From 1997 to 2007 lustration was dealt with by the office of the Public Interest Spokesperson ({{lang-pl|Rzecznik Interesu Publicznego}}), who analyzed lustration declarations and could initiate further proceedings. According to a new law which came into effect on 15 March 2007, lustration in Poland is now administered by the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] ({{lang-pl|Instytut Pamięci Narodowej}}; IPN).&lt;ref name="15March2007"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal/pl/305/4870/ Najważniejsze wiadomości – Informacje i materiały pomocnicze dla organów realizujących postanowienia ustawy lustracyjnej] IPN News.

===In Ukraine===
{{Main |Lustration in Ukraine}}
In [[Ukraine]], the term lustration refers to the exclusion from public office of civil servants who worked under [[Ukrainian President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] for more than a year "and did not resign of their own accord" between 25 February 2010 and [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|22 February 2014]] and civil servants who were active in the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. They may be excluded for five to ten years.&lt;ref name=KP141023&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/lustration-law-faces-sabotage-legal-hurdles-369135.html |title= Lustration law faces sabotage, legal hurdles |work= [[Kyiv Post]] |date= 23 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Devitt''' (born 1938) is an [[Australian]] [[philosopher]] currently teaching at the [[City University of New York]] in [[New York, NY|New York City]].  His primary interests include [[philosophy of language]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]].  His current work involves the philosophy of [[linguistics]], foundational issues in [[semantics]], the semantics of [[definite descriptions]] and [[demonstratives]], [[semantic externalism]], and [[scientific realism]].

He is a noted proponent of the [[causal theory of reference]].  He claims that repeated groundings in an object can account for reference change. However, such a response leaves open the problem of cognitive significance that originally intrigued [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Gottlob Frege]].

Michael Devitt, along with [[Georges Rey]], is also a critic of the transcendental argument against [[eliminativism]], and defends this position against claims that it is self-refuting by invoking [[deflationary theory of truth|deflationary semantic theories]] that avoid analysing [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]] like "x is true" as expressing a real property. They are construed, instead, as logical devices so that asserting that a sentence is true is just a quoted way of asserting the sentence itself. To say, "'God exists' is true" is just to say, "God exists". This way, Rey and Devitt argue, in so far as dispositional replacements of "claims" and deflationary accounts of "true" are coherent, eliminativism is not self-refuting.&lt;ref&gt;Devitt, M. &amp; Rey, G. (1991). ''Transcending Transcendentalism'' in Pacific Philosophical Quarterly 72: 87-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Devitt is a known critic of [[constructivist epistemology]].

==Education==
Devitt's [[secondary education]] (1952&amp;ndash;1957) was at [[Bradfield College]] in [[Berkshire, England]], where he completed 3 "A" Levels and 9 "O" Levels.  He then studied at the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia|Institute of Chartered Accountants]] in [[Australia]] between 1958&amp;ndash;1961, taking his qualifying exam at the end of that time.

His [[higher education]] began at the [[University of Sydney]] in 1962, where he studied philosophy and [[psychology]].  He graduated in 1966 with First Class Honours and a University Medal in philosophy.  He continued on as a post-graduate research student until 1967, when he moved to [[Harvard University]] and studied under [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]].  He received his MA in 1970 and his PhD in 1972.

==Academic positions==
Following the completion of his coursework at Harvard, Michael Devitt returned to [[Sydney]] in 1971 and began his teaching career as a lecturer in the Philosophy department. He was prominent in the 'Sydney philosophy disturbances'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/sydq.html The Sydney Philosophy Disturbances]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was made a senior lecturer in 1977 and Associate Professor in 1982, and by 1985 was named as Head of Department of Traditional and Modern Philosophy.  He continued teaching at the University of Sydney until 1987, after which he returned to the [[United States]] and accepted an appointment of Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] in 1988.  He remained in [[Maryland]] until 1999, when he became a Professor (later Distinguished Professor) at the [[CUNY Graduate Center]].  There he served as the Executive Officer of the Philosophy Program from 1999&amp;ndash;2002.  He continues to teach there as a Distinguished Professor as of 2012.

In addition to his tenured or tenure-track positions, Michael Devitt has held numerous non-tenured positions at the [[University of Nottingham]], [[Macquarie University]], [[Australian National University]], [[Victoria University of Wellington]], [[University of Michigan]], [[University of Southern California]], [[Tokyo Metropolitan University]], [[Harvard University]], and [[Sydney University’s Women’s College]].

[It can be said with certainty that Dutch was being spoken at the end of the 9th century; how long that might have been the case before that cannot be determined with certainty.]&lt;/ref&gt; Old Dutch is mostly recorded on fragmentary relics, and words have been reconstructed from Middle Dutch and Old Dutch loanwords in French.&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary: Old Dutch&lt;/ref&gt; 

Old Dutch is regarded as the primary stage in the development of a separate Dutch language. However, as the modern Dutch borders do not reflect any special delimitation of the continental West-Germanic [[dialect continuum]] during the Old Dutch period, in which no [[standard language]]s yet existed, some linguists prefer to avoid the term "Old Dutch" altogether and speak solely of Old Low Franconian. It was spoken by the descendants of the [[Salian Franks]] who occupied what is now the southern [[Netherlands]], northern [[Belgium]], part of northern France, and parts of the [[Lower Rhine]] regions of Germany.  It evolved into [[Middle Dutch]] around the 12th century. The inhabitants of northern Dutch provinces, including [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Friesland]] and the coast of [[North Holland]], spoke [[Old Frisian]], and some in the east ([[Achterhoek]], [[Overijssel]] and [[Drenthe]]) spoke [[Old Saxon]].

{{legend|#0000ff|'''[[w:Crimean Gothic|Crimean Gothic]]''' ([[w:East Germanic|East Germanic]])}}]]
Before the advent of Old Dutch or any of the Germanic languages, [[Proto-Germanic|Germanic dialects]] were [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]. The [[Ingvaeonic languages|North Sea Germanic]] dialects were spoken in the whole of the coastal parts of the Netherlands and Belgium. [[Old Frisian]] was one of these dialects, and elements of it survived through the [[West Frisian language|Frisian language]], spoken in the province of [[Friesland]] in the North of the Netherlands. In the rest of the coastal region these dialects were mostly displaced following the withdrawal to [[England]] of the migrating [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]], who gave rise to Old English. 

It was largely replaced by [[Istvaeones|Weser-Rhine Germanic]] dialects, spoken by the [[Salian Franks]]. It spread from northern Belgium and the southern Netherlands to the coast and evolved into Old Low Franconian or Old Dutch. It has, however, a North sea Germanic [[Substratum (linguistics)|substrate]], which is why some philologists put the language in that branch.&lt;ref name="Verhaal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willemyns|first1=Roland|title=Dutch: Biography of a Language|publisher=Oxford University Press USA|isbn=9780199858712|pages=33|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=Xo2MGkyEfbMC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=when+started+old+english,+old+dutch,+old+high+german&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wCX21F_rNp&amp;sig=csdV5LYUK48F7vSXx6qHqPgmIfU&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=when%20started%20old%20english%2C%20old%20dutch%2C%20old%20high%20german&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists typically date this transition to around the 5th century.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taalunieversum.org/inhoud/geschiedenis-van-het-nederlands|title=Geschiedenis van het Nederlands|website=Taalunieversum.org|accessdate=2017-08-27|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation with other West Germanic languages===

====Central Franconian and Old High German====
Old Dutch is divided in Old West Low Franconian and Old East Low Franconian ([[Limburgish|Limburgian]]), however, these varieties are very closely related. The divergence being that the latter shares more traits with neighboring historical forms of [[Central Franconian dialects]] such as [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] and [[Moselle Franconian]]. While both forms of Low Franconian were instrumental to the framing of [[Middle Dutch]], Old East Low Franconian did not contribute much to [[Dutch language|Standard Dutch]], which is based on the consolidated [[Hollandic dialect|dialects of Holland]] and [[Brabantian dialect|Brabant]].

During the [[Merovingian Dynasty|Merovingian]] period, the Central Franconian dialects were influenced by Old Low Franconian (Old Dutch), resulting in certain linguistic loans which yielded a slight overlap of vocabulary, most of which relates to [[warfare]]. In addition is the subsumption of the [[High German consonant shift]], a set of phonological changes beginning around the 5th or 6th century that partially influenced Old Dutch, and extensively influenced Central Franconian and other [[Old High German]] dialects. 

====Old Saxon, Old English and Old Frisian====
{{See|Netherlandic sound shift}}
[[Old English]], [[Old Frisian]] and (to a lesser degree) [[Old Saxon]] share the application of the [[Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law]]. Old Dutch was considerably less affected than the other three languages, but a dialect continuum formed or existed between both Old Dutch and Old Saxon, as well as Old Dutch and Old Frisian. Despite sharing some particular features, a number of disparities separate Old Saxon, Old English, and Old Dutch; one such difference is the Old Dutch use of ''-a'' as its plural a-stem noun ending, while Old Saxon and Old English employ ''-as'' or ''-os''. Much of the grammatical variation between Old Dutch and Old Saxon is similar to that between Old Dutch and Old High German.

===Relation to Middle Dutch===
Old Dutch naturally evolved into [[Middle Dutch]] with some distinctions that approximate those found in most medieval West Germanic languages. The year 1150 is often cited as the time of the discontinuity, but it actually marks a time of profuse [[Medieval Dutch literature|Dutch writing]] whose language is patently different from Old Dutch.

The most notable difference between Old and Middle Dutch is in a feature of speech known as [[vowel reduction]]. Round vowels in word-final syllables are rather frequent in Old Dutch, but in Middle Dutch, they are reduced to a [[schwa]]:

:{| class="wikitable"

The following is a translation of [[Psalm 55]]:18, taken from the [[Wachtendonck Psalms]]; it shows the evolution of Dutch, from the original Old Dutch, written {{circa}} 900, to modern Dutch, but so accurately copies the [[Latin]] [[word order]] of the original that there is little information that can be garnered on Old Dutch [[syntax]]. In Modern Dutch, recasting is necessary to form a coherent sentence.

==Surviving texts==
[[File:Old Dutch manuscripts discoveries.png|300px|thumb|Discoveries of Old Dutch texts. 1. [[Bergakker]] [[Bergakker inscription|inscription]] 2. [[Doornik]] (birthplace [[Clovis I]]): [[Salic law]] 3. [[Utrecht]] [[Utrecht Baptismal Vow|Baptismal Vow]] 4. [[Munsterbilzen]]: [[Wachtendonck Psalms]] 5. [[Egmond Abbey|Egmond]] [[Leiden Willeram|Willeram]] 6. [[West Flanders]]: [[Hebban olla vogala]] 7. [[Werden]]: [[Rhinelandic Rhyming Bible]]]]
Old Dutch texts are extremely rare and much more limited than for related languages like [[Old English]] and [[Old High German]]. Most of the earliest texts written in the Netherlands were written in [[Latin]], rather than Old Dutch. Some of the Latin texts, however, contained Old Dutch words interspersed with the Latin text. Also, it is hard to determine whether a text actually was written in Old Dutch, as the [[Germanic languages]] spoken at that time were not standardised and were much more similar to one another.

===Oldest word? (108)===
&lt;blockquote&gt;wad&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Several words that are known to have developed in the Netherlands before Old Dutch was spoken have been found, and they are sometimes called "Oudnederlands" (English: "Old Netherlandic") in a geographic sense. The oldest known example, ''[[wikt:wad#Dutch|wad]]'' (English: "mudflat"), had already been mentioned in AD&amp;nbsp;108 by [[Tacitus]]. The word exclusively referred to the region and ground type that is now known as the [[Wadden Sea]]. However, since the word existed long before Old Dutch did (and even before did its parent language, [[Frankish language|Frankish]]), it cannot be considered part of the vocabulary of Old Dutch but rather of [[Proto-Germanic]].

===Bergakker inscription (425–450)===
{{Main article|Bergakker inscription}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;haþuþuwas ann kusjam loguns&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Bergakker runes.png|thumb|The Elder Futhark runes from the 5th-century Bergakker inscription, found in Netherlands.]]
This sentence has been interpreted as "[property] of Haþuþewaz. I bestow upon the choosers of the swords". It was discovered on a [[Bergakker inscription|sword sheath]], excavated in 1996 in the Dutch village of [[Bergakker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mees |first=Bernard |authorlink= |editor-last=Vennemann |editor-first=Theo |contribution=The Bergakker Inscription and the Beginnings of Dutch |title=Amsterdamer Beitrage zur Alteren Germaninstik |publisher=Rodopi |date=2002 |location= |pages=23–26 |volume=56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W91nBn0l96wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |doi= |id= |isbn=90-420-1579-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is perhaps better described as [[Frankish language|Frankish]] than Old Dutch (Frankish was the direct parent language of Old Dutch).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=William W. |editor1-last=Kibler |editor2-first=Grover A. |editor2-last=Zinn|title=Medieval France: an encyclopedia|date=1995|publisher=Garland|location=New York|isbn=0824044444|pages=703|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text however, shows the beginning of Old Dutch morphology. The word ''ann'', found in the partially-translated inscription is coined as the oldest Dutch by linguists Nicoline van der Sijs and Tanneke Schoonheim from [[Genootschap Onze Taal]]. They attribute that word to the ancestor of the modern Dutch verb root ''[[wikt:gunnen#Dutch|gun]]'', through the addition of the prefix [[wikt:ge-#Dutch|''ge-'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennislink.nl/publicaties/meer-dan-hebban-olla-uogala|title=Meer dan hebban olla uogala|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word has no clear English [[cognate (etymology)|cognate]]. Its modern meaning is roughly "to think someone deserves something, to derive satisfaction from someone else's success", and it is commonly translated as "grant" or "bestow".

=== Salic Law (6th century) ===
{{Main article|Lex Salica}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Maltho thi afrio lito&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Gloss (annotation)|Glosses]] to the Salic law code (the ''Malbergse glossen'') contain several Old Dutch words and this full sentence, which is likely the earliest in the language. It translates as "I declare, I free you, half-free" and was written in the early 6th century. The phrase was used to free a [[serf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dutch: Biography of a Language|last=Willemyns|first=Roland|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-19-932366-1|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JBu9lOijWYcC&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=Maltho+thi+afrio+lito&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q=Maltho+thi+afrio+lito&amp;f=false|title=Dutch: Biography of a Language|first=Roland|last=Willemyns|date=15 March 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=26 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''lito'' (English: ''half-free'') was a form of serf in the [[feudal system]], a half-free farmer, who was connected to the land of the lord for whom he worked but not owned by that lord. In contrast, a slave was fully owned by the lord. The Old Dutch word and the Modern Dutch counterpart ''laat'' are both etymologically and in meaning undoubtedly related to the verb root ''laat'' (English: 'let go', 'release'), which may indicate the fairly free status of such person in relation to that a slave. Note that the Old Dutch word ''lito'' is particularly recognisable in the verb's past tense ''lieten''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/laat2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827051320/http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/laat2 |archivedate=2017-08-27 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Utrecht Baptismal Vow (8th century) ===
{{Main article|Utrecht Baptismal Vow}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;End ec forsacho allum dioboles uuercum and uuordum, Thunær ende Uuôden ende Saxnôte ende allum thêm unholdum thê hira genôtas sint.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Utrecht Baptismal Vow'', or ''Old Saxon Baptismal Vow'', is a 9th-century [[Baptismal vows|baptismal vow]] that was found in a monastery library in the German city of [[Mainz]] but was written in the Dutch city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. The sentence translates as "And I renounce all the deeds and words of the devil, Thunear, Wōden and Saxnōt, and all those fiends that are their companions". It mentions three [[Germanic paganism|Germanic pagan]] gods of the early [[Saxons]] which the reader is to forsake: Uuôden ("[[Woden]]"), [[Thor|Thunaer]] and [[Saxnōt]]. Scholar [[Rudolf Simek]] comments that the vow is of particular interest because it is the sole instance of the god Saxnōt mentioned in a religious context. One of many baptismal vows, it is now archived in the [[Holy See|Vatican]] Codex pal. 577.&lt;ref name="SIMEK276"&gt;Simek, p.276.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes interpreteted as Old Saxon, a number of Dutch and German scholars have concluded the Baptismal Vow was actually written in the 8th century in Old Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=N.|last=Van der Sijs|title=Calendarium van de Nederlandse Taal|date=2006|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grupello.de/dateien/C018.pdf|title=Utrecht zwischen York und Fulda|language=German}} "Aus dem kodikologischen Kontext und aus der Geschichte des mit der Handschrift verbundenen Bonifatiusklosters Fulda ist zu schließen, daß Utrecht – auch wenn die sprachliche Argumentation an sich ungenügend ist, um die Texte dem kleinen Kloster zuzuschreiben – die beste Kandidatur für die Autorschaft besitzt. Die monastische Schriftkultur ist also in den nördlichen Niederlanden im 8. Jahrhundert seßhaft geworden."&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty in establishing whether the text was written in Old Saxon or Old Franconian is that those languages were very much alike.

=== The Wachtendonck Psalms (10th century) ===
{{Main article|Wachtendonck Psalms}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Irlôsin sol an frithe sêla mîna fan thên thia ginâcont mi, wanda under managon he was mit mi&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Wachtendonck Psalms'' are a collection of Latin [[psalm]]s, with a translation in an eastern variety of Old Dutch (Old East Low Franconian) which contains a number of Old High German elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=M. C.|last=Van den Toorn|displayauthors=et al|title=Geschiedenis van de Nederlandse taal|date=1997|page=41}} With reference to Gysseling 1980;{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} Quak 1981;{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} De Grauwe 1979, 1982.{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The example sentence above translates as "He will deliver my soul in peace from those who attack me, for, amongst many, he was with me." Probably based on a Central Franconian original, very little remains of the psalms. They were named after a manuscript that has not survived but was the source from which scholars believe the surviving fragments must have been copied. The manuscript was once owned by Canon Arnold Wachtendonck. The surviving fragments are handwritten copies made by the Renaissance scholar [[Justus Lipsius]] in the sixteenth century. Lipsius made a number of separate copies of what appeared to be the same material, but the versions do not always agree. In addition, scholars conclude that the numerous errors and inconsistencies in the fragments point not only to some carelessness or inattentiveness by the Renaissance scholars but also to errors in the now-lost manuscript out of which the material was copied. The language of the Psalms suggests that they were originally written in the 10th century.

=== The Leiden Willeram (1100) ===
{{Main article|Leiden Willeram}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thes naghtes an minemo beddo vortheroda ich minen wino. Ich vortheroda hine ande ne vand sin niet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This example sentence taken from the ''Leiden Willeram'' translates as "All night long on my bed I looked for the one my heart loves; I looked for him but did not find him". The manuscript, now in the library of the [[Leiden University]] in the Netherlands, contains an Old Dutch translation of an Old High German (East Frankish)commentary on [[Song of Solomon]], written by the German abbot [[Williram of Ebersberg]]. The translation was done by a monk of the [[Egmond Abbey|Abbey of Egmond]], and so the manuscript's other name is ''Egmond Willeram''. The text represents an imperfect attempt to translate the original into the local Old Dutch vernacular. The text contains many Old Dutch words as well as mistranslated words since the scribe must have been unfamiliar with some Old High German words in the original. It could nevertheless be regarded as the first book written in Old Dutch. However, since the book never left the abbey, it cannot be regarded as the start of a Dutch literature and did not influence later works.

=== Hebban olla vogala (1100) ===
{{Main article|Hebban olla vogala}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hebban olla vogala nestas hagunnan hinase hic enda thu, uuat unbidan uue nu.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Arguably the most famous text containing Old Dutch, the fragment is translated as "All birds have started making nests, except me and you, what are we waiting for?" The text is dated from around 1100 and written by a West Flemish monk in a convent in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]], [[England]]. For a long time, the sentence was commonly but erroneously considered to be the earliest in Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=GHK9U8HC|title='Olla Vogala' nog even in woordenboek|website=Standaard.be|accessdate=2017-08-26|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, it could be considered the oldest Dutch non-religious poetry. The text is usually considered a [[West Flemish]] dialect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=M.|last=Schönfeld|title=Een Oudnederlandsche zin uit de elfde eeuw (met reproduktie)|journal=Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsche Taal- en Letterkunde|volume=52|date=1933|page=1–8|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but certain [[Ingvaeonic]] forms might be expected in any of the coastal dialects of Old English, Old Frisian, Old Saxon or Old Dutch. However, the ''-n'' of the third-person plural ''hebban'', which is absent in both Old English and Frisian, identifies the language as Old Dutch ([[Old High German]] ''habent'' uses a different stem). ''Hagunnan'' and ''hi(c)'' have a [[prothesis (linguistics)|prothetic]] ''h'', which points also to West Flemish in which the ''h'' was frequently dropped or, in the written language, added before vowels (compare ''abent'' in the Latin version). However, it has been postulated that the text could equally well be [[Old English]], more specifically [[Kentish dialect (Old English)|Old Kentish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Luc|last=De Grauwe|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_tij003200401_01/_tij003200401_01_0004.php|title=Zijn ''olla vogala'' Vlaams, of zit de Nederlandse filologie met een koekoeksei in (haar) nest(en)?|journal=Tijdschrift voor Nederlandse Taal- en Letterkunde|language=Dutch|volume=120|date=2004|page=44–56|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;nu saget mir einen kuning other greven, the an uren got wille gelouven, that se sagent, that ist gelogen, thes ist thaz arme volc bedrogen.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Translated as "Mention one king or earl who wants to believe in their god, what they say is a lie, that's how the people are being deceived", this fragment comes from an important source for Old Dutch: the Rhinelandic Rhyming Bible (Dutch: ''Rijnlandse Rijmbijbel''; German: ''Rheinische Reimbibel''). The verse translation of biblical histories is attested only in a series of fragments from different writers.  It contains Low German (Low Saxon), Old Dutch (Low Franconian) and High German (Rhine-Franconian) elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David A.|last=Wells|title=The "Central Franconian Rhyming Bible" ("Mittelfränkische Reimbibel"): An early-twelfth-century German verse homiliary|location=Amsterdam|publisher=Rodopi|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was likely composed in the northwest of Germany in the early 12th century, possibly in [[Werden Abbey]], near [[Essen]].

==Phonology==

===Early sound developments===
Phonologically, Old Dutch stands in between [[Old Saxon]] and [[Old High German]], sharing some innovations with the latter, and others with the former.

;Characteristics shared with Old Saxon:

* The Old Germanic diphthongs ''ai'' and ''au'' become the long vowels ''ē'' and ''ō''. Examples: ''hēm'', ''slōt''. There are, however, several examples that show that a diphthong ''ei'' remained in some cases.
* Loss of Proto-Germanic ''z'' word-finally in single-syllable words, e.g. ''thi'' vs Old High German ''thir''/''dir'' &lt; PG ''*þiz'' (dative of the second-person singular pronoun).

;Characteristics shared with Old High German:

* The West Germanic ''ō'' ({{IPA|/oː/}}) and ''ē'' ({{IPA|/eː/}}, from Proto-Germanic ''ē&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'') become diphthongs ''uo'' and ''ie'' in stressed syllables. Old Dutch ''fluot'' versus Old Saxon ''flōd'', Old Dutch ''hier'' versus Old Saxon ''hēr''.
* The ''h''-sound in consonant clusters at the beginning of a word disappears around the 9th century while it is retained in the northern languages. Examples include Old Dutch ''ringis'' ("ring", genitive), Old High German ''ring'' versus Old Saxon and Old English ''hring'', or ''ros'' ("steed") versus Old English ''hros'' ("horse").
* ''j'' is lost when following two consonants, with ''-jan'' becoming ''-en''. It is most prominent in ja- and jō-stem nouns and adjectives, and in verbs of the first weak class.

;Characteristics not shared with Old Saxon or Old High German:

* [[Final obstruent devoicing]]. This later spread to the other Germanic dialects (as well as several [[Romance languages]] such as [[Old French]] and [[Old Occitan]]).
* ''h'' disappears between vowels (shared with the [[Anglo-Frisian languages]]). Old Dutch ''thion'', Old English ''þēon'' versus Old High German ''dîhan'', or Old Dutch ''(ge)sian'', Old English ''sēon'' versus Old High German ''sehan''. (The ''h'' in modern German ''sehen'' {{IPA|/ˈzeː.ən/}} became mute only in later stages of German.)
* The sound combination ''hs'' ({{IPA|/xs/}}) becomes a geminated ''ss''. Example: Old Dutch ''vusso'' versus Old Saxon ''fohs'', Old High German ''fuhs''. (A development shared by the [[Middle Franconian]] dialects of High German: compare [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] ''Fuuss''. The Anglo-Frisian languages instead shift ''hs'' to ''ks'': compare Old English ''fox'', [[Old Frisian]] ''foks''.)

Notes:
* {{IPA|/m, p, b/}} were most likely [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]] whereas {{IPA|/f, v/}} were most likely [[Labiodental consonant|labiodental]].
* {{IPA|/n, t, d, s, l/}} could have been either dental {{IPA|[{{IPA link|n̪}}, {{IPA link|t̪}}, {{IPA link|d̪}}, {{IPA link|s̪}}, {{IPA link|l̪}}]}} or alveolar {{IPA|[{{IPA link|n|n͇}}, {{IPA link|t|t͇}}, {{IPA link|d|d͇}}, {{IPA link|s|s͇}}, {{IPA link|l|l͇}}]}}.
** {{IPA|/n/}} had a velar allophone {{IPAblink|ŋ}} when it occurred before the velars {{IPA|/k, ɣ/}}.
** {{IPA|/l/}} had a velarised allophone {{IPAblink|ɫ}} between a back vowel and {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}}. It might have also been used in other environments, as it is the case in Modern Dutch.
* {{IPA|/θ/}} was likely [[Dental consonant|dental]] {{IPAblink|θ|θ̪}}, but it could have also been alveolar {{IPAblink|θ̠|θ͇}}, as it is the case in Modern Icelandic.
* {{IPA|/r/}} was most likely [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], either a [[Trill consonant|trill]] {{IPAblink|r|r͇}} or a [[Tap consonant|tap]] {{IPAblink|ɾ|ɾ͇}}.
* Most consonants could be [[Gemination|geminated]]. Notably, geminated {{IPA|/v/}} gave {{IPA|[bb]}}, and geminated {{IPA|/ɣ/}} probably gave {{IPA|[ɡɡ]}}. Geminated {{IPA|/h/}} resulted in {{IPA|[xx]}}.
* In the course of the Old Dutch period the voiceless spirants {{IPA|/f, θ, s/}} gained voiced allophones {{IPA|[{{IPA link|v}}, {{IPA link|ð}}, {{IPA link|z}}]}} when positioned at the beginning of a syllable. The change is faithfully reflected for {{IPA|[v]}}, the other two allophones continuing to be written as before. In the Wachtendonck Psalms, it is very rare, but much later, it can be seen in the spelling of Dutch toponyms. Thus, the sound change was taking place during the 10th and 11th century.
* {{IPA|/v/}} also occurred word-medially as an independent phoneme, developed from Proto-Germanic {{IPA|[β]}}, the fricative allophone of {{IPA|/b/}}.
* After {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/ɣ/}} was realized as a plosive {{IPAblink|ɡ}}.
* Postvocalic {{IPA|/h/}} was realized as velar {{IPAblink|x}}.

====Final-obstruent devoicing====
[[Final-obstruent devoicing]] of Proto-Germanic {{IPA|[β]}} to {{IPA|[f]}} occurred across the West Germanic languages, and thus also in Old Dutch. Old Dutch spelling also reveals final devoicing of other consonants, namely:
* {{IPA|[d]}} &gt; {{IPA|[t]}}: ''wort'' ("word", nominative) versus ''wordes'' (genitive)
* {{IPA|[ɣ]}} &gt; {{IPA|[x]}}: ''weh'' {{IPA|[wex]}} ("way", accusative) versus ''wege'' ("way", dative)

Final devoicing was countered by the syllable-initial voicing of voiceless fricatives, which made {{IPA|[v]}} and {{IPA|[f]}} allophones of each other.

Final devoicing appears much earlier in Old Dutch than it does Old Saxon and Old High German. In fact, by judging from the [[Bergakker inscription|find at Bergakker]], it would seem that the language already had inherited this characteristic from [[Old Frankish]] whereas Old Saxon and Old High German are known to have maintained word-final voiced obstruents much later (at least 900).

|
|colspan=2|
|}

Notes:
* Phonetic realisation of {{IPA|/uː/}} differed by area. In most areas, it was probably realised phonetically as central {{IPAblink|ʉː}} or front {{IPAblink|yː}} or a diphthong {{IPA|[ʉ̞w ~ ʏw]}} before a vowel, but it was probably retained as back {{IPA|[uː]}} or {{IPA|[ʊw]}} in others (at least in Limburg). While there is no direct evidence for this in Old Dutch, it can be inferred by later developments in Middle Dutch.
* Long vowels were rare in unstressed syllables and occurred mostly because of suffixation or compounding.
* {{IPA|/y/}} and {{IPA|/ø/}} were originally [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] allophones of {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} before {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/j/}} in the following syllable. They were, however, partly phonemicised when the conditioning sounds were gradually lost over time. Sometimes, the fronting was reverted later. Regardless of phonemic distinction, they were still written as ''u'' and ''o''.
* As in northwestern [[High German]], {{IPA|/u/}} was lowered to {{IPA|[o]}} by the end of the Old Dutch period and is no longer distinguished from {{IPA|/o/}} (likely {{IPA|[ɔ]}}) in writing. In western dialects, the two phonemes eventually merge.
* {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e/}} were also similar in articulation, but they did not merge except in some small and frequently used monosyllables (such as ''bin'' &gt; ''ben'', 'I am'). They, however, merged consistently when they were later lengthened in open syllables.
* The backness of {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}} is unknown. They may have been front {{IPA|[{{IPA link|a}}, {{IPA link|aː}}]}}, central {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ä}}, {{IPA link|äː}}]}}, back {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɑ}}, {{IPA link|ɑː}}]}} or mixed (for example, {{IPA|/a/}} was back {{IPAblink|ɑ}} whereas {{IPA|/aː/}} was front {{IPAblink|aː}}, as in modern Dutch).
** {{IPA|/a/}} probably had a rounded allophone {{IPA|[ɒ]}} before velarised {{IPA|[ɫ]}}. It eventually merged with {{IPA|/o/}} in this position, as in Low Saxon, but in Dutch, the velar {{IPA|[ɫ]}} [[L-vocalization|vocalised]], creating a diphthong.

In unstressed syllables, only three vowels seem to have been reliably distinguished: open, front and back. In the Wachtendonck Psalms, the ''e'' and ''i'' merged in unstressed syllables, as did ''o'' and ''u''. That led to variants like ''dagi'' and ''dage'' ("day", dative singular) and ''tungon'' and ''tungun'' ("tongue", genitive, dative, accusative singular and nominative, dative, accusative plural). The forms with ''e'' and ''o'' are generally found later on, showing the gradual reduction of the articulatory distinction, eventually merging into a [[schwa]] ({{IPA|/ə/}}). A short phrase from the [[gospel book]] of [[Munsterbilzen Abbey]], written around 1130, still shows several unstressed vowels distinguished:

: Tesi samanunga was edele unde scona
: ''This community was noble and pure''

That was a late monument, however, as the merging of all unstressed short vowels was already well underway by that time. Most likely, the difference was maintained only in spelling traditions, but it had been mostly lost in speech. With the introduction of new scribal traditions in the 12th and 13th century, the practices were abandoned, and unstressed vowels were consistently written as ''e'' from that time onward.

Notes:
* The closing diphthongs {{IPA|/ei/}} and {{IPA|/ou/}} occurred systematically only in the southeastern dialects, having merged with {{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/oː/}} elsewhere. The other dialects retained only {{IPA|/ei/}}, in words where earlier {{IPA|/ai/}} had been affected by umlaut (which prevented it from becoming {{IPA|/eː/}} in many Old Dutch dialects, but not in Old Saxon).
* The situation for the front opening diphthongs is somewhat unclear, but it seems similar to the situation for unstressed short vowels. Words written with ''io'' in [[Old High German]] are often found written with ''ia'' or even ''ie'' in Old Dutch. They had likely merged with each other already during the Old Dutch period.
* Similarly {{IPA|/iu/}} eventually merged with the other opening diphthongs in some dialects. In the others, it merged with {{IPA|/uː/}} in most cases (after having passed through an intermediate stage such as {{IPA|[yu]}}).
* There also existed 'long' diphthongs {{IPA|/aːu/}} and {{IPA|/eːu/}}, but these were treated as two-syllable sequences of a long vowel followed by a short one, not as proper diphthongs.

==Orthography==
Old Dutch was spelt using the Latin alphabet. However, since early missionaries in the [[Low Countries]] were mostly Old English and Old High German speakers, Old English and Old High German elements appear even if they were never present in the spoken language.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The length of a vowel was generally not represented in writing probably because{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} the monks, who were the ones capable of writing and teaching how to write, tended to base the written language on Latin, which also does not make a distinction in writing: ''dag'' "day" (short vowel), ''thahton'' "they thought" (long vowel). Later on, the long vowels were sometimes marked with a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] to indicate a long vowel: ''ā''. In some texts long vowels were indicated by simply doubling the vowel in question, as in the placename ''Heembeke'' and personal name ''Oodhelmus'' (both from charters written in 941 and 797 respectively).

* ''c'' is used for {{IPA|[k]}} when it is followed by ''u'', ''o'' or ''a'': ''cuning'' {{IPA|[kuniŋk]}} 'king' (modern ''koning''). In front of ''i'' or ''e'', the earlier texts (especially names in Latin deeds and charters) used ''ch''. By the later tenth century, the newer letter ''k'' (which was rarely used in Latin) was starting to replace this spelling: ''kēron'' {{IPA|[keːron]}} 'to turn around' (mod. ''keren'').
* It is not exactly clear how ''c'' was pronounced before ''i'' or ''e'' in Old Dutch. In the Latin orthography of the time, ''c'' before front vowels stood for an affricate {{IPA|[t͡s]}}; it is quite likely that early Dutch spelling followed that pronunciation.
* ''g'' represented {{IPA|[ɣ]}} or its allophone {{IPA|[ɡ]}}: ''brengan'' {{IPA|[breŋɡan]}} 'to bring', ''segghan'' {{IPA|[seɡɡan]}} 'to say', ''wege'' {{IPA|[weɣe]}} 'way' (dative).
* ''h'' represents {{IPA|[h]}} and its allophone {{IPA|[x]}}: ''holto'' {{IPA|[hoɫto]}} 'wood' (mod. ''hout''), ''naht'' 'night' (mod. ''nacht'').
* ''i'' is used for both the vowels {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[iː]}} and the consonant {{IPA|[j]}}: ''ik'' {{IPA|[ik]}} 'I' (mod. ''ik''), ''iār'' {{IPA|[jaːr]}} 'year' (mod. ''jaar'').
* ''qu'' always represents {{IPA|[kw]}}: ''quāmon'' {{IPA|[kwaːmon]}} 'they came' (mod. ''kwamen'').
* ''s'' represented the consonant {{IPA|[s]}} and later also {{IPA|[z]}}.
* ''th'' is used to indicate {{IPA|[θ]}}: ''thāhton'' {{IPA|[θaːxton]}} 'they thought' (mod. ''dachten''). Occasionally, ''dh'' is used for {{IPA|[ð]}}.
* ''u'' represented the vowels {{IPA|[u]}} and {{IPA|[uː]}} or the consonant {{IPA|[v]}}: ''uusso'' {{IPA|[vusso]}} 'foxes' (genitive plural).
* ''uu'' was normally used to represent {{IPA|[w]}}. It evolved into the separate letter ''w'' during the later middle ages. See [[W#History]].
* ''z'' rarely appears, and when it does, it is pronounced {{IPA|[ts]}}: ''quezzodos'' {{IPA|[kwetsodos]}} 'you hurt' (past tense, now ''kwetste'').

==Grammar==
{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}

===Nouns===
Old Dutch preserved at least four of the six cases of Proto-Germanic: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive case|genitive]] and [[dative case|dative]]. A fifth case, the [[instrumental case|instrumental]], may have also existed.{{clarify|reason=Is it attested?|date=May 2015}}.

=== {{anchor|d1}} The ''a'' declension ===
The ''-s'' ending in the masculine plural was preserved in the coastal dialects, as can be seen in the Hebban Olla Vogalla text where ''nestas'' is used instead of ''nesta''. Later on, the ''-s'' ending entered Hollandic dialects and became part of the modern standard language.

=== {{anchor|d1}} The ''o'' declension &amp; weak feminine declension ===
During the Old Dutch period, the distinction between the feminine ''ō''-stems and ''ōn''-stems began to disappear, when endings of one were transferred to the other declension and vice versa, as part of a larger process in which the distinction between the strong and weak inflection was being lost not only in feminine nouns but also in adjectives. The process is shown in a more advanced stage in Middle Dutch.

===Verbs===
Old Dutch reflects an intermediate stage between Old Saxon and Old High German. Like Old High German, it preserved the three different verb endings in the plural (''-on'', ''-et'' and ''-unt'') while the more northern languages have the same verb ending in all three persons. However, like Old Saxon, it had only two classes of weak verb, with only a few relic verbs of the third weak class, but the third class had still largely been preserved in Old High German.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="92513">A '''perfect season''' is a sports [[season (sports)|season]] including any requisite playoff portion, in which a team remains and finishes undefeated and untied. The feat is extremely rare at the professional level of any team sport, and has occurred more commonly at the collegiate and scholastic levels in the United States. A '''perfect regular season''' (known by other names outside the United States of America) is a season ''excluding'' any playoffs, where a team remains undefeated and untied; it is less rare than a complete perfect season but still exceptional.

A perfect season may be part of a multi-season [[winning streak (sports)|winning streak]].

[[Exhibition game]]s are generally not counted toward standings, for or against. For example, the 1972 Miami Dolphins (below) lost three of their preseason ("exhibition" games in 1972 NFL vernacular) games but are considered to have had a perfect season.

==American football==

===National Football League===
{{Main|1972 Miami Dolphins season}}
Since the [[National Football League]] began in [[1920 NFL season|1920]], only one team has played a complete perfect season (both regular season and playoffs): [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|the 1972 Miami Dolphins]], who won all fourteen of their regular season games and three postseason games, including [[Super Bowl VII]], to finish the season 17–0–0.

The Dolphins briefly extended their winning streak before losing to [[1973 Oakland Raiders season|the Oakland Raiders]] on September 23, 1973. It has often been reported that the surviving members of the 1972 Dolphins would, every season, either gather to drink champagne when the final undefeated team earned its first loss of the year, or send a case of champagne to the team who beat this final undefeated team. The head coach of the 1972 Dolphins, [[Don Shula]], denied this in a 2007 interview with ESPN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wojciechowski|first=Gene|title=Shoes ...

====NFL undefeated seasons (with ties) prior to 1932====
Prior to the development of a playoff system in the NFL in [[1932 NFL season|1932]], there were four teams who completed seasons undefeated, but with one or more tied games: [[1920 Akron Pros season|the 1920 Akron Pros]], [[1922 Canton Bulldogs season|the 1922 Canton Bulldogs]], [[1923 Canton Bulldogs season|the 1923 Canton Bulldogs]], and [[1929 Green Bay Packers season|the 1929 Green Bay Packers]]. According to the 2012 NFL Record &amp; Fact Book, under NFL practices at the time, from 1920 to 1971 tie games were not included in winning percentage (there was also no [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] to settle ties in the regular season until 1974) so, these four teams were recorded with perfect win percentages of 1.000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/history/pdfs/History/Past_Standings_2011.pdf | title=2012 NFL Record &amp; Fact Book | publisher=NFL | accessdate=18 September 2013 | pages=393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[1921 Buffalo All-Americans season|The 1921 Buffalo All-Americans]] were controversially denied a similar type of near-undefeated season, when they believed that their final game, [[Staley Swindle|a 10-7 loss to the Chicago Staleys]], was an exhibition game which would not count in the final standings; the NFL records that game as official, and Buffalo's record as 9–1–2.

====Other NFL perfect regular seasons====
{{Main|1934 Chicago Bears season|1942 Chicago Bears season|2007 New England Patriots season}}
Apart from the 1972 Dolphins, three NFL teams have completed undefeated and untied regular seasons: [[1934 Chicago Bears season|the 1934 Chicago Bears]], [[1942 Chicago Bears season|the 1942 Chicago Bears]], and [[2007 New England Patriots season|the 2007 New England Patriots]].

In 1934, the Bears played a 13–0–0 regular season and became the first NFL team to complete an undefeated regular season without tied games, but lost the [[1934 NFL Championship Game]] against [[1934 New York Giants season|the New York Giants]]. Despite losing several players and head coach [[George Halas]] to military service in World War II, the 1942 Bears finished 11–0–0 but again lost the [[1942 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]], this time against [[1942 Washington Redskins season|the Washington Redskins]].

The 2007 Patriots became the first team after the NFL expanded its regular season to sixteen games in [[1978 NFL season|1978]] to finish the regular season undefeated. The Patriots then won their divisional and conference playoff games, but were upset by [[2007 New York Giants season|the New York Giants]] in [[Super Bowl XLII]], giving them a final record of 18–1.

===Pre-NFL era and competing leagues===
NFL predecessors such as the [[Ohio League]], [[New York Pro Football League]] and [[Western Pennsylvania Professional Football Circuit]]  had many perfect seasons. In Ohio, the [[Massillon Tigers]] (1904, 1905), [[Akron Indians]] (1909), [[Shelby Blues]] (1911), and [[Dayton Triangles]] (1918) all had perfect seasons during this era. In New York, the [[Buffalo (NFL)|Buffalo Niagaras]] went 5–0–0 (6–0–0 including a forfeit) in a league that consisted of teams entirely from the city of Buffalo in 1918. In 1920, the [[Union Club of Phoenixville]], located in eastern Pennsylvania, played in a league mostly consisting of local teams and earned a perfect season, claiming for itself a [[mythical national championship]]. In western Pennsylvania, the [[1900 Homestead Library &amp; Athletic Club football team|1900]] and [[1901 Homestead Library &amp; Athletic Club football team|1901]] Homestead Library and Athletic Club teams, as well as the 1903 [[Franklin Athletic Club]], all had perfect seasons.

The caliber of talent was neither as high nor as consistent between teams at the time, the seasons were generally shorter (7 to 11 games), and it was not uncommon for top teams to play all their games at home while lesser teams played all of their games on the road. In 1918, Dayton and Buffalo had the additional advantage of having its strongest competitors suspend operations due to the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish flu]] and the [[World War I|First World War]], restrictions that also prevented the two teams from playing each other. Thus, it was much easier to earn a perfect season than it would become in the NFL.

====1937 Los Angeles Bulldogs====
The [[Los Angeles Bulldogs]] were a member of the [[American Football League (1936)|second American Football League]], who joined the league in 1937 after the [[Cleveland Rams]] defected to the NFL. Playing a combination of AFL teams and independent franchises (such as the [[Providence Steam Roller]] and the [[Salinas Packers]]), the team went 16–0, with 8 of those wins coming against AFL teams. The Bulldogs’ dominance is cited as one of the key factors in the AFL's demise,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and the next season as an independent with a 10–2–2 record including a 2–1–2 record against NFL teams, several of the team's players were invited to play on the "Pro All Stars" team in the NFL's first [[Pro Bowl|Pro All-Star Game]] in Los Angeles. The Bulldogs are considered to be one of the few independent teams to have ever achieved parity with the NFL.

====1948 Cleveland Browns====
The [[Cleveland Browns|Browns]] were a member of the [[All-America Football Conference]], a professional football league that played from 1946 to 1949.  In 1948, the Browns won all fourteen regular season games and the [[All-America Football Conference#1948|1948 AAFC championship]] to post a 15–0–0 record. Cleveland's perfect 1948 season was part of a longer string of 29 straight wins, which stretched from 1947 to 1949 and included both the 1947 and 1948 title games.  Overall, the Browns won all four AAFC championship games and were accepted into the NFL when the two leagues merged after the 1949 season.

Neither the NFL nor the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] recognizes the Bulldogs’ perfect season; the Hall of Fame recognizes the Browns’ perfect season but the NFL does not.

===Close to perfect===
Since the NFL expanded to a fourteen-game regular season in [[1961 NFL season|1961]], eleven teams have had regular seasons with one loss and no ties (or better) while failing to achieve a perfect season:

|}

Most of these teams suffered their regular-season loss early in the year and, other than the 2007 Patriots (finished regular season 16–0), only the 1962 Packers (10–0), 1985 Bears (12–0),  2011 Packers (13–0), and 2015 Panthers (14–0) were on track for a perfect season when they lost. Coincidentally, the 1985 Bears’ lone loss came to the Miami Dolphins.

The best start from an NFL team who failed to complete a perfect regular season is shared by two teams: the [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|2009 Indianapolis Colts]], who started 14–0 before losing their final two regular season games to the [[2009 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] and the [[2009 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] to finish 14–2, and the [[2015 Carolina Panthers season|2015 Carolina Panthers]], who went 14–0 before losing to the [[2015 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] and going on to finish the regular season 15–1. The 2009 Colts, having clinched the top seed in the AFC, sacrificed their chances at a perfect regular season and instead [[resting the starters|rested their starters]] the final two games to protect them for the playoffs. The Colts would go on to [[Super Bowl XLIV]] but lost to the [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]]. The 2015 Panthers were not resting their starters at the time of their loss (at the time, the [[2015 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] were 13–2 and still had an opportunity to surpass the Panthers for the top seed in the NFC).

Four other teams have started 13–0 before losing their fourteenth game: the [[1998 Denver Broncos season|1998 Denver Broncos]], [[2005 Indianapolis Colts season|2005 Indianapolis Colts]], [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|2009 New Orleans Saints]] and [[2011 Green Bay Packers season|2011 Green Bay Packers]] (Of those near-perfect seasons, the 2011 Packers are the only team that did not win a single playoff game). The 1998 Broncos, 2005 Colts and 2009 Saints lost at least two of their final three games but the Broncos and Saints recovered to win the Super Bowl. The [[1953 Cleveland Browns season|1953 Cleveland Browns]] and [[1969 Los Angeles Rams season|1969 Los Angeles Rams]] started 11–0 in twelve- and fourteen-game seasons respectively; both lost their only playoff game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballgeography.com/?p=3190|title=Last Undefeated NFL Team(s) in Each Season » FootballGeography.com|website=www.footballgeography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other leagues===
The following is a list of teams in minor or alternate leagues that compiled perfect seasons of six games or more, including postseason games, with no ties:

*The Hollywood Bears, a member of the [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League]], went 8–0–0 in 1941.
*The Hollywood Rangers were a member of the [[American Football League (1944)|American Football League of 1944]] (formerly the Northwest War Industries League), a short-lived competitor to the [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League]] on the West Coast. In their 1944 season, they went 11–0–0 and defeated the PCPFL champion San Diego Bombers (who had also had a perfect season in their league, going 9–0–0) in a two-game series.
*The Charleston Rockets of the [[Continental Football League]] won all 14 games of the league's inaugural season in 1965, going on to defeat the [[Toronto Rifles]] in the league's championship.
*The Hartford Knights went 17–0–0 in 1972 as a member of the [[Seaboard Football League]], including a victory over the [[Chambersburg Cardinals]] in the league's championship. The Knights, unhappy with the level of competition (many of the Knights games had margins of victory of 40 points or more), quit the league the following year.

In [[indoor American football|indoor football]], the following teams have had perfect seasons:

*The [[Quad City Steamwheelers]] went undefeated in the [[2000 AF2 season|inaugural season]] of [[AF2|arenafootball2]], accruing a record of 19–0–0 including playoffs and an [[ArenaCup I]] win.
*The [[Ohio Valley Greyhounds]] of the [[National Indoor Football League]] accrued a perfect season in 2003.
*The [[Sioux Falls Storm]] of [[United Indoor Football]] won back-to-back perfect seasons in 2006 and 2007, winning the United Bowl championship both years.
*The [[Fayetteville Guard]] won a perfect season in 2007 in the NIFL.
*The [[Rochester Raiders]] won a perfect season in [[2008 Continental Indoor Football League season|2008]] in the [[Continental Indoor Football League]], but withdrew from that league during the playoffs in a dispute.
*The [[Baltimore Mariners]] won a perfect season in [[2010 American Indoor Football Association season|2010]] in the [[American Indoor Football Association]].
*The [[Erie Explosion]] won a perfect season in [[2013 Erie Explosion season|2013]] in the Continental Indoor Football league, winning all ten regular season games, a semifinal playoff, and the CIFL Championship.

At least twenty-three other semi-professional football teams have had perfect seasons, seven of them being at least 17 games long. The [[Chambersburg Cardinals]] won a record 72 straight games between 1977 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Brainerd (2010). [http://www.semiprofootball.org/minor/records/teamgame.htm Minor league football records - Winning streaks].&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been no perfect seasons (or even perfect regular seasons) in the [[American Association (football)|American Association]], [[World Football League]], [[United States Football League]], [[XFL]], or, to date, the [[Arena Football League]]. The [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]] has had two perfect regular seasons, but neither qualify for the list: [[2009 Florida Tuskers season|the 2009 Florida Tuskers]] finished 6–0, but that team lost the subsequent [[2009 UFL Championship Game|championship game]]; the [[2012 Las Vegas Locomotives season|2012 Las Vegas Locomotives]] had a record of 4–0 when the league abruptly suspended operations halfway through the season.

The 1933 [[Providence Huskies]] (possibly a successor to the [[Providence Steam Roller]]) played arguably the most perfect season ever recorded by a professional or semi-professional team: a ten-game season in which they won every game and did not concede a single point during any game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semiprofootball.org/minor/records/teampnts.htm |title=Semi-pro Football / Minor League Football – Team Points Records |publisher=Semiprofootball.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leagues outside North America===
In the [[2014 German Football League]] the [[Braunschweig Lions]] compiled a perfect season (12–0 postseason 3–0), losing only in the [[BIG6 European Football League]] which is a different competition. They crowned the season with another German Bowl triumph. Similarly in the [[2016 German Football League]] the [[Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns]] achieved a perfect regular season with a 14–0 record, similarly their lone defeat came in the [[BIG6 European Football League]] which is not considered for league standings. However, unlike Braunschweig before them, Schwäbisch Hall ultimately lost the [[German Bowl]], in this case to Braunschweig. In the [[2017 German Football League]] season, Schwäbisch Hall once more compiled a perfect season (14-0) but this time also won the [[German Bowl]], again against Braunschweig. Interestingly, their opponent in the final had also entered the game with a 14-0 regular season record.

==Canadian football==
A true perfect season (no losses and no ties through the regular season and playoffs) has never been achieved in professional Canadian football. Only one team, the 1948 [[Calgary Stampeders]], has completed a perfect regular season.

The current [[Canadian Football League]] schedule would require a team to win 20 games (18 regular season, 1 playoff after bye week, and the Grey Cup championship) to post a perfect record.

===1948 Calgary Stampeders===
Under head coach [[Les Lear]], the 1948 [[Calgary Stampeders]] completed a perfect regular season with a record of 12–0; they had two wins and a tie during the playoffs to finish with a record of 14–0–1, the only undefeated complete season in Canadian pro history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&amp;id=208] Grey Cup History (CFL.ca), Accessed December 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western Interprovincial Football Union]] championship (a home-and-home [[Playoff format#Total points series (aggregate)|aggregate]] series decided on total points) against the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders|Regina Roughriders]], the first leg was tied 4–4, and the Stampeders won the second 21–10, to win the aggregate 25–14. The Stampeders then defeated the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] 12–7 for the [[36th Grey Cup]].

Despite the Stampeders' title, their achievement was only lightly regarded in the East. At the time, the Eastern and Western unions played separate regular seasons and only met in the Grey Cup. The Western union was openly regarded to be a weaker competition in the East, and Calgary's win (only the third for a Western team up to that time) was dismissed as a fluke.

==Lacrosse==
In professional [[lacrosse]], the [[1993 MILL season|1993]] [[Buffalo Bandits]] are the only team to have won a perfect season in the [[National Lacrosse League]]. The Bandits won all ten of their regular season games and won the championship in a two-round tournament; the season was the continuation of a multi-season winning streak that dated to the Bandits’ successful run for the [[1992 MILL season|previous year's]] championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.buffalonews.com/sports_ink/2011/07/three-former-bandits-among-six-nominated-for-nll-hall.html |title=Three former Bandits among six nominated for NLL Hall – Sports, Ink &amp;#124; The Buffalo News |publisher=Blogs.buffalonews.com |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Major League Lacrosse]], which began play in 2001, [[2013 Denver Outlaws season|the 2013 Denver Outlaws]] were the first team to complete a perfect regular season, winning all fourteen of their games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/lacrosse/ci_23837209/denver-outlaws-beat-hamilton-finish-season-undefeated-at ‘Denver Outlaws beat Hamilton, finish season undefeated at 14–0’]; ''[[Denver Post]]'', 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; After beating [[2013 Hamilton Nationals season|the Hamilton Nationals]], the Outlaws had a sequence of twenty consecutive regular season wins despite losing [[2012 MLL season|the 2012 championship]]. However, the Outlaws lost in the first round of the playoffs [[2013 Charlotte Hounds season|to the Charlotte Hounds]], who had only gone 7–7 in the regular season.

==Other North American professional sports leagues==
In North America's three other major professional sports leagues ([[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Basketball Association]], and the [[National Hockey League]]) it is almost impossible for a team to play a “perfect” season, primarily because there are substantially more games in the regular season (82 in the NBA and NHL, and 162 in Major League Baseball). The [[Women's National Basketball Association]]‘s season has been between 28 and 34 games long, and it too has never produced a perfect season.

It is possible for a baseball [[pitcher]] to achieve a perfect season, taking at least one win and any number of no-decisions throughout the year. This has happened 1813 times in baseball's history, though the majority (1171) were 1–0 seasons, mostly by [[relief pitcher]]s. The best perfect season belongs to [[Tom Zachary]] of the 1929 [[New York Yankees]], who posted a 12–0 record in 119.2 innings. No pitcher has ever achieved a perfect season while qualifying for the [[Earned run average|ERA]] title.

In the NBA, the [[1985–86 NBA season|1985–86]] [[1985–86 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] played a nearly perfect home season. During the regular season, they were 40–1 (.976) in front of their home crowd. The [[Boston Celtics|Celtics']] only regular-season home loss occurred on December 6, 1985, to [[1985–86 Portland Trail Blazers season|the Portland Trail Blazers]], by the score of 121–103. The Celtics would also win all 10 of their home games in the postseason, to finish 50–1 at home. The [[2015–16 NBA season|2015–16]] [[2015–16 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]] also played a nearly perfect home regular-season with a 40-1 (.976) record in front of their home crowd, with their only home loss occurring on April 10, 2016 vs. the [[Golden State Warriors]] by the score of 92-86. The Spurs were eliminated in the Western Conference Semi-Finals by the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in the [[2016 NBA Playoffs]].  The Spurs played a total of 5 home games in the post season, finishing 43-3 at home, losing twice to the Thunder. The three-on-three basketball league [[BIG3]], which featured an eight-game regular season and two-round playoff, had a perfect team in its inaugural season when [[Trilogy (basketball)|Trilogy]] swept all ten games on their schedule.

===Individual professional sports===
For other sports leagues for individuals, such as the [[PGA Tour]] or [[NASCAR]], a perfect season would represent winning every event in a season. Considering the number of tournaments or races in those leagues, and the fact that each individual faces over 40 opponents as opposed to one, a perfect season is almost impossible.

Golf instead considers the [[Grand Slam (golf)|Grand Slam]], a sweep of the four [[men's major golf championships]] deemed to be the most difficult contests in professional golf, to be analogous to perfection. The only time the Grand Slam has been swept in any given year was 1930, when [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] won all four majors (at the time, [[The Amateur Championship|The (British) Amateur Championship]] and [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur]] were still considered majors); since 1934, when [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]] was added as a major, no player has won all four in one year. [[Tiger Woods]] is the only professional golfer to win four consecutive professional majors; he did so over two years in 2000 and 2001. The record for most consecutive wins in professional golf is 11, set [[Byron Nelson]] in 1945; Nelson would win 18 tournaments overall that year, a year when wartime manpower shortages were still limiting the number and quality of professional golfers for Nelson to compete against.

In [[Formula One]], [[Michael Schumacher]] was the 2004 champion with 13 wins in 18 races. In IndyCar, [[A. J. Foyt]] won 10 out of 13 races. In [[NASCAR]], [[Richard Petty|Richard "The King" Petty]] holds most of the records for most wins in a season; he won 27 races out of 48 appearances in 1967, 10 of them consecutive. Since a format change in 1972, Petty also holds the modern-era record for most wins in a season, with 13, a record he shares with [[Jeff Gordon]].&lt;ref name=Daytona&gt;{{cite book|title=Daytona: From the Birth of Speed to the Death of the Man in Black|last=Hinton|first=Ed|year=2001|publisher=Warner Books|location=New York|isbn=0-446-52677-0|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional motorcycle racer [[Ricky Carmichael]] had perfect seasons in 2002 and 2004. In 1997, [[road racing|road racer]] [[Tommy Kendall]] started the 13-race [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] [[Trans-Am Series]] season 11–0, the longest documentable win streak in worldwide professional road racing.&lt;ref name="Deepthrottle"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th race, he was battling for the lead on the final lap, but spun out and finished second. The feat would be extremely difficult in NASCAR, because of the length of the season (currently 36 races).

==American collegiate sports==

=== NAIA Football ===
In 1966 Waynesburg College went 11–0 after a 9–0 regular season record.
In December 1966 Waynesburg defeated New Mexico Highlands in Albuquerque, New Mexico in the playoff game, 
and, defeated Whitewater Wisconsin in the NAIA Champion Bowl at Tulsa Oklahoma.
This was, and still is a college football rarity. 
Very few college football teams have won a College National Football Championship (including playoff games)
with an undefeated  record.

===NCAA Football===

The record for most wins in an undefeated FBS season is 14–0, accomplished in 2002 by [[2002 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]], twice in [[2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2009]] by [[2009 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State]] and [[2009 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]], in [[2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2010]] by [[2010 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]], and in [[2013 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2013]] by [[2013 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]].

The [[Washington Huskies football|University of Washington]]'s FBS record 64-game unbeaten streak included five straight perfect seasons from 1909–13.&lt;ref name=unbeaten&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2014/fbs.pdf | title=2014 NCAA Football Record Book | publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] | page = 117 | format=PDF | accessdate=2014-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Oklahoma Sooners football|University of Oklahoma's]] FBS record 47 game winning streak included three straight perfect seasons from 1954–56.

===NCAA Division I Basketball===

====Men====
Before the establishment of the [[National Invitation Tournament]] in 1938 and the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] in 1939, perfect seasons were more common; each season consisted of fewer games and top teams from different parts of the country might never meet.

Eight teams have completed perfect seasons, including postseason tournament victories, since the tournament era began in 1938:
* [[LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds men's basketball|1939 LIU Blackbirds]] (24–0) — [[1939 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] champion, which at the time was more prestigious than the NCAA tournament
* [[1955–56 San Francisco Dons men's basketball team|1956 San Francisco Dons]] (29–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1956–57 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|1957 North Carolina Tar Heels]] (32–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1963–64 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1964 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1966–67 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1967 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1971–72 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1972 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1972–73 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1973 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1975–76 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1976 Indiana Hoosiers]] (32–0) – NCAA champion

In addition, four other teams in the tournament era had unbeaten records, but did not play in any postseason tournament:
* 1940 [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall Pirates]] (19–0) — not invited to either the NCAA Tournament or NIT.
* 1944 [[Army Black Knights men's basketball|Army Cadets]] (15–0) — not invited to either the NCAA Tournament or NIT. (Given that this season was during World War II, it is also possible that Army chose to turn down tournament invitations.)
* [[1953–54 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|1954 Kentucky Wildcats]] (25–0) — declined a bid to the NCAA Tournament due to an NCAA ruling that graduate students could not compete.
* 1973 [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|NC State Wolfpack]] (27–0) — ineligible for postseason competition due to rule violations earlier that season.

The UCLA Bruins are the only team to have back-to-back perfect seasons (1971–1972, 1972–1973), and all four of the college's perfect seasons were under Hall of Fame head coach [[John Wooden]].

The following teams completed a perfect regular season, but lost in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] or other postseason action:

Since Cornell's 29–0–0 season in 1969–70, the closest Division I Men's Ice Hockey Team to having a perfect season was the 1992–93 [[Maine Black Bears men's ice hockey|Maine Black Bears]], who finished that year at 42–1–2, including a national title game victory against [[Lake Superior State Lakers men's ice hockey|Lake Superior State]]. Their only loss came on February 19, 1993, against [[Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey|Boston University]], where they lost 7-6 in overtime, and their only ties were on October 24 against [[Providence Friars men's ice hockey|Providence]], 3-3, and on January 15 against [[Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey|Clarkson]], 4-4.

The 1955–56 Clarkson Golden Knights were undefeated and untied (23–0–0), but skipped the NCAA tournament because as the team had seniors with four years of college play which was against NCAA tournament rules at the time (not regular season rules).

The 1967–68 [[Iona Gaels men's ice hockey|Iona Gaels]] went 16–0–0 in their inaugural season as an independent in Division III, but did not participate in a national championship as none existed for Division III at that time.

The [[Australian Football League|VFL]] began in 1897. Based entirely in the state of Victoria, before it expanded through the 1980s, and 1990s to become the top level national league (AFL) in the sport of Australian rules football. The length of a complete season (including finals matches) has typically been between 18 and 26 games. Throughout the history of the league, no team has ever completed a perfect season. One team, {{AFL Col}} in [[1929 VFL season|1929]], completed a perfect home-and-away season, finishing with a record of 18–0; the club won the premiership, but did not complete a perfect season after losing the [[Second amended Argus system|second semi-final]] against {{AFL Ric}}.

===South Australian National Football League (SANFL)===
{{main|1914 Port Adelaide Football Club season}}
The SANFL has existed since 1877 within South Australia, and until the latter part of the twentieth century was of equivalent standard to the VFL. The only perfect season to be completed was by the 1914 [[Port Adelaide Magpies|Port Adelaide]] team, known as the "Invincibles". Port won all four of its pre season matches. It finished the minor round with a 12–0 record, before winning both finals to finish with a 14–0 record and a perfect season.

===West Australian Football League (WAFL)===
The [[West Australian Football League|WAFL]] has existed since 1885 within Western Australia, and until the latter part of the 20th century was of equivalent standard to either the VFL or SANFL.

There were also cases of teams going undefeated through the season in the nineteenth century, but none completed perfect seasons because some of their matches were drawn. Of those, {{AFL Gee}} could be interpreted as having been perfect in [[1879 VFA season|1879]]; it had a record of 15–0–1, and the draw came by agreement when a match was abandoned due to inclement weather.&lt;ref name="review1"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|date=18 October 1879|title=The Football Season of 1879 – Part 1|author=Peter Pindar|publication-place=Melbourne|page=493|issue=707|volume=XXVII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four other teams have completed perfect home-and-away seasons, but subsequently lost finals matches:&lt;ref&gt;Fiddian, Marc; ''The VFA: a history of the Victoria Football Association 1877–1995''; pp. 226-299. Published 2004 by On-Demand Pty Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rugby league==
===National Rugby League===
The [[National Rugby League]] has existed since 1908, being originally known as the New South Wales Rugby League and before the [[Super League]] war of 1995 as the Australian Rugby League. In its history, only one team has completed a perfect season: the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] in [[1925 NSWRFL season|1925]], who won all twelve games contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season 1925|publisher=Rugby League Tables|url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1925.html|accessdate=3 Jun 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417012749/http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1925.html|archivedate=2011-04-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five other teams have gone undefeated but featured at least one drawn match: [[Wests Tigers|Balmain]] ([[1915 NSWRFL season|1915]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season 1915|publisher=Rugby League Tables|url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1915.html|accessdate=3 Jun 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514040757/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1915.html|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]] ([[1921 NSWRFL season|1921]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season 1921|publisher=Rugby League Tables|url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1921.html|accessdate=3 Jun 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191321/http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1921.html|archivedate=2011-07-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] ([[1936 NSWRFL season|1936]] and [[1937 NSWRFL season|1937]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season 1936|publisher=Rugby League Tables|url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1936.html|accessdate=3 Jun 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415193223/http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1936.html|archivedate=2011-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season 1937|publisher=Rugby League Tables|url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1937.html|accessdate=3 Jun 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415070403/http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1937.html|archivedate=2011-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[St George-Illawarra Dragons|St George]] ([[1959 NSWRFL season|1959]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season 1959|publisher=Rugby League Tables|url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1959.html|accessdate=3 Jun 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191602/http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1959.html|archivedate=2011-07-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Brisbane Rugby League===
The [[Brisbane Rugby League premiership]] began in 1909 and continued in varying forms until 1996, after which it was superseded by the [[Queensland Cup]]. Between the 1930s and the 1960s it was of comparable standard to the New South Wales Rugby Football League, but subsequently a huge drain of players to Sydney eroded the standard of play. Before [[World War II]] seasons were typically no more than twelve games long; however as the competition grew it was expanded to 21 games by 1960. The only BRL teams to manage a perfect season were:

|}
===British Rugby League===
Whilst no rugby league team in Britain has completed the perfect season in the top flight, this has been achieved on two occasions in lower divisions, once in the 2nd division and once in the 3rd. [[Hull F.C.]] achieved this feat in the [[1978–79 Northern Rugby Football League season|1978–79 Season]], where they won 26 from 26 games, gaining promotion to the top division for the second time in three seasons. This was also achieved by the [[Dewsbury Rams]] in [[2009 Championship 1|2009]] during their [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship 1]] (third division) season where they won all 18 games from a possible 18, winning promotion immediately after being relegated the previous season where they won just two games. Since their 2009 promotion, the Rams have so far stayed in the sports' second division, including two play off finishes.

In [[2017 League 1|2017]], the [[Toronto Wolfpack]] completed the regular reason with a perfect 15–0 record, however after the [[2017 League 1 results#Super 8s|Super 8s]] finished with a 22-1-1 record.

==Rugby union==

===International Rugby===
The [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand All Blacks]] were the first professional rugby team to produce a perfect rugby test season in 2013. They successfully defeated {{nrut|France}} four times, {{nrut|Australia}} three times, {{nrut|South Africa}} and {{nrut|Argentina}} twice and also beat {{nrut|Japan}}, {{nrut|England}} and {{nrut|Ireland}} in their incredible winning run. They produced a record of 14–0–0, defeating the top 5 ranked teams below them in the IRB world rankings. {{nrut|England}} have matched this feat after producing a perfect test season in 2016 after recovering from getting knocked out of their own [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] in [[2015 Rugby World Cup|2015]].

===Super Rugby===
The Southern Hemisphere's principal team competition, [[Super Rugby]], established as Super 12 in 1996 and later known as Super 14 before adopting its current name in 2011, has seen only one perfect season. The [[Crusaders (rugby union)|Crusaders]], based in [[Christchurch]] and representing a large portion of the [[South Island]] of New Zealand, finished the [[2002 Super 12 season]] with an 11–0–0 record and went on to win both of their finals matches to claim the season crown unbeaten.

One other team has won a championship unbeaten: in [[1997 Super 12 season|1997]], the [[Blues (Super Rugby)|Auckland Blues]] (known simply as "Blues" since 2000), which at the time represented the central and southern parts of the [[Auckland]] area plus some adjacent regions to the south, finished the regular season with one draw from 11 matches. They also won both of their finals matches to claim the title.

==Association football==

===Domestic teams===
Many [[association football]] teams have also had perfect seasons, however doing so in a season of 20 or more matches is very rare. Clubs to have achieved this include: [[Dresdner SC]] of Germany in 1942–43 (23 wins out of 23), [[Ferencvárosi TC|Ferencvárosi]] of Hungary in 1931–32 (22), [[Sunrise Flacq United]] of [[Mauritius]] in 1995–96 (22), and [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]] of [[Uruguay]] in 1941 (20).&lt;ref name="rsssf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/unbeaten.html |title=Unbeaten |publisher=Rsssf.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Ahly]] (of Egypt) hold the record of going a whole season being unbeaten, in all possible competitions they were involved in (46 matches in total played in: Egyptian Premier League, Egyptian Cup, Egyptian Super Cup and CAF Champions League between 2005 and 2006). The longest winning streak of any team over multiple seasons was [[Sparta Prague]]'s run of at least 51 wins in a row, between 1920 and 1923.&lt;ref name="rsssf"/&gt;

Teams finishing a season unbeaten (i.e. having won or drawn every match) are more common. [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[2003–04 FA Premier League|2003–04 English Premier League season]], finished with no losses from 38 games over 100 years after [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] unbeaten streak in 22 league games and all of its FA Cup games in [[1888–89 in English football|1888–89]]. At the same time, AFC Wimbledon finished with a [[2003–04 AFC Wimbledon season|record]] of 42 wins, 4 draws and 0 defeats out of 46 games in their [[Combined Counties League Premier Division]] season. In Belgium, From 1933 to 1935  [[Royale Union Saint-Gilloise]]  played 60 consecutive matches undefeated, setting a still unbeaten record in Belgium. In Italy, [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] ([[1978–79 Serie A|1978–79]]), [[A.C. Milan]] ([[1991–92 Serie A|1991–92]]), and [[Juventus F.C.]] ([[2011–12 Serie A|2011–12]]) have been undefeated. In Turkish soccer, [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] in the [[1985–86 1.Lig|1985–86]] season completed the season unbeaten but finished as runners-up, although having the same points as [[Beşiktaş J.K.]], who won, but had an inferior goal difference to their rival. [[Beşiktaş J.K.]] in [[1991–92 1.Lig|1991–92]] completed the season unbeaten and became Turkish League's only ever champions without defeat. In Portugal, [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] ([[1972–73 Primeira Liga|1972–73]]) was the first club to do so and won 28 matches – 23 consecutively – out of 30, and drew two. They also went undefeated in [[1977–78 Primeira Liga|1977–78]] but finished second to [[F.C. Porto|Porto]], who lost once that season. Porto finished the [[2010–11 Primeira Liga|2010–11]] and [[2012–13 Primeira Liga|2012–13]] seasons unbeaten, with a respective win–draw record of 27–3 and 24–6. In Saudi Arabia, [[Al-Hilal FC]] finished a 26-game season in the [[2010–11 Saudi Professional League|2010–11]] with 19 wins and 7 draws, whilst in [[Iraq]], [[Al-Shorta FC]] went the entire [[1980–81 Iraqi League]] season undefeated. Greek club [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] finished the [[1963–64 Alpha Ethniki|1963–64 season]], Hungarian club [[Debreceni VSC]] finished the [[2011–12 Nemzeti Bajnokság I|2011–12 season]], Norwegian club [[Rosenborg BK]] finished the [[2010 Norwegian Premier League|2010 season]] undefeated. The only unbeaten champion in [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Brazil]] was [[Sport Club Internacional|SC Internacional]], who won the [[1979 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|1979 season]] with 16 victories and 7 ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colunas.globoesporte.com/memoriaec/2008/12/23/inter-79-unico-campeao-brasileiro-invicto/|title=Internacional 1979: único campeão brasileiro invicto|language=Portuguese|publisher=[[Rede Globo|Globo Esporte]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]] finished the [[1993–94 Maccabi Haifa F.C. season|1993–1994]] season (a 39-game season) in the Israeli Premier League with 28 wins and 11 draws.

[[Egyptian Premier League]] giants [[Al Ahly SC|Al Ahly]] are the only African club to have ever completed an entire domestic season unbeaten, let alone twice, having won their 30th league title in the [[2004–05 Egyptian Premier League|2004–05 season]] with a record of 24 wins and 2 draws and their 31st league title the [[2005–06 Egyptian Premier League|following season]] with a slightly worse record of 23 wins and 3 draws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahly surrender unbeaten record in Egypt |url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/109/374/index.html |agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |publisher=[[FIFA]] |date=8 January 2007 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, [[2014 Úrvalsdeild|2014]] eventual Icelandic champions [[Stjarnan men's football|Stjarnan]] who were unbeaten faced an [[FH Hafnarfjördur|FH]] side in an away game which was the last game of the season, coincidentally before the match, FH were also unbeaten. In a closely fought match Stjarnan emerged victorious courtesy of a 94th-minute penalty from [[Ólafur Karl Finsen]] to knock FH out of first place and secure Stjarnan's first Icelandic championship.

[[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] went domestically unbeaten across the [[2016–17 Celtic F.C. season|2016–17 season]] over all 38 league games in [[Football in Scotland|Scotland]], finishing 30 points clear of second-place [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] with 34 wins and 4 draws. Celtic also won the [[2016–17 Scottish League Cup]] and the [[2016–17 Scottish Cup]], giving them the accolade of being the only club to win a domestic treble unbeaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Forsyth|first=Roddy|title=Brendan Rodgers salutes Celtic's 'Invincibles' after they dig deep against Hearts|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/05/21/brendan-rodgers-salutes-celtics-invincibles-dig-deep-against/|accessdate=23 May 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pattullo|first=Alan|title=Gordon Strachan: Celtic "invincibles" will boost Scotland|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/gordon-strachan-celtic-invincibles-will-boost-scotland-1-4453829|accessdate=23 May 2017|work=The Scotsman|date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FIFA World Cup===

The likelihood of a national team in the [[FIFA World Cup]] to win all of its matches in regulation time to become the champion is much higher than most clubs in their domestic league, as the finals tournament in its current format only lasts seven games — although this feat has only happened twice, [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on both instances in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]. This is not counting the [[FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying round]] of the tournament, which lasts over a year and has had a varied format since [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]]. Only the Brazilian team of 1970 has won every game in the qualification and final rounds of a single tournament, a total of 13 games.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=32/results/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=32/preliminaries/preliminary=28/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] came very close achieving the same feat as Brazil did in 1970. The Netherlands won 8 out of 8 qualifying games and went on to win the next 6 [[FIFA World Cup 2010|World Cup]] matches in regulation time only to lose in [[overtime (sports)|extra time]] to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in the final, ending with a 14–0–1 record.

===FIFA Women's World Cup===
Through [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup|2011]], the likelihood of a national team winning all of its matches in the [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] was slightly greater than in the men's version. The Women's World Cup began in [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|1991]] with 12 teams and expanded to 16 effective in [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup|1999]]. Under both structures, the winning team only had to win six games (three in group play and three in the knockout stage) to win the title unbeaten. The tournament expanded to 24 teams in [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup|2015]], at which time the number of games that the champion must play increased to seven (the same total as in the men's World Cup).

The 2011 event, won by [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]], was the first in which the champion lost in group play; the other finalist, the [[United States women's national soccer team|USA]], had also lost in group play. Each previous team to have won the title — the US in 1991 and 1999, [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]] in [[1995 FIFA Women's World Cup|1995]], and [[Germany women's national football team|Germany]] in [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup|2003]] and [[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup|2007]] — won all of its group stage matches. In fact, only one of these teams, the US in 1999, had a knockout match go to extra time—specifically the final against [[China women's national football team|China]], which ultimately went to a [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Germany won all of its matches in the 2007 final tournament without giving up a goal, becoming the first team in either the men's or women's World Cup to accomplish this feat. The USA's third championship team in 2015 had one draw in the group stage.

Three Women's World Cup champions also went through their qualifying stage without a loss or draw:
* USA, 1991 ([[1991 CONCACAF Women's Championship|5 wins]])
* Germany, 2003 ([[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|6 wins]])
* Germany, 2007 ([[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|8 wins]])

Of the other two teams to win the Women's World Cup without a loss or draw in the finals:
* Norway went through their 1995 qualification campaign with 8 wins, 1 draw and 1 loss.
* The USA automatically qualified for the 1999 edition as host.

==Handball==
===Germany===
In 2011/2012, German handball champion [[THW Kiel]] achieved a perfect season of as many as 34 matches. Additionally, the team also won the national DHB Cup and the international [[EHF Champions League]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toyota-handball-bundesliga.de/handball/tabelle.php?liga=1&amp;menuid=215&amp;topmenu=214 Toyota Handball Bundesliga - final table] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609080844/http://www.toyota-handball-bundesliga.de/handball/tabelle.php?liga=1&amp;menuid=215&amp;topmenu=214 |date=June 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
In the [[Liga ASOBAL]] the [[FC Barcelona Handbol]] had 4 consecutive perfect seasons from the [[Liga ASOBAL 2013–14|2013-14]] season to the [[Liga ASOBAL 2016–17|2016-17]] season.

===Croatia===
In the [[Premijer liga]] the [[RK Zagreb]] is unbeaten for 11 years, they won 190 consecutive games, last time they lost against [[Osijek Motormodul]] (38:39) on 14.4.2007. In that 190 games they just have one tie with [[RK Poreč]] (31:31), after that game they won 178 games in a row and that row is still active.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080812031321/http://sport.hrt.hr:80/htvsport/rukomet/06_07/m_IIdio.html]

==Volleyball==
In the 2012–13 Season, [[Vakıfbank Spor Kulübü|Vakıfbank İstanbul]] won all 52 games and reached five championship trophies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tvf.org.tr/img/uploads/arsiv/2012-2013/2012-2013_Genel_Fikstur_web.xls |website=[[Turkish Volleyball Federation]] |title=Genel Fikstür |year=2012 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192342/http://www.tvf.org.tr/img/uploads/arsiv/2012-2013/2012-2013_Genel_Fikstur_web.xls |archivedate=2014-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in

*[[2012–13 CEV Women's Champions League]],
*2013 Turkish Women's Volleyball Super Cup and
*[[2013 FIVB Women's Club World Championship]].

Vakıfbank İstanbul won 6 games in [[Turkish Women's Volleyball Cup]], 12 games in [[CEV Women's Champions League]], 29 games (22 league, 7 play-off games) in [[Turkish Women's Volleyball League]], 1 game in Turkish Women's Volleyball Super Cup and 4 games in [[FIVB Volleyball Women's Club World Championship]], and never lost in the 2012–13 Season. In addition, they won all 51 games they played in year 2013.

Having started Turkish Women's Volleyball League's 2013–14 Season with 13 wins and [[2013–14 CEV Women's Champions League]] with 8 wins, they extended their winning streak to 73 games as of January 23, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fanatik.com.tr/vakifbank-73-yapti-ceyrek-finale-kaldi_3_Detail_29_352567.htm |website=[[Fanatik]] |title=Vakıfbank 73 yaptı çeyrek finale kaldı |date=2014-01-23 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2014-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Netball==

===Commonwealth Bank Trophy===
The Commonwealth Bank Trophy was the main national netball competition in Australia from 1997 to 2007. There were eight teams in a double round robin format and finals.

The Sydney Swifts were the only team to achieve a perfect season, winning all fourteen regular season games and both their finals matches for a record of 16–0.

===ANZ Championship===
The ANZ Championship, the principal netball competition for Australia and New Zealand was established in 2008 to replace the Commonwealth Bank Trophy. Comprising ten teams (five from Australia and five from New Zealand) there has so far been one perfect season, by the Mission Queensland Firebirds, based in [[Brisbane, Queensland]] in 2011. The Firebirds won thirteen regular season games and both their finals matches for a record of 15–0. In 2010, the New South Wales Swifts managed to win all thirteen regular season games, but lost both of their finals matches and ended with a 13–2 for that year.

==Cricket==
===County cricket===
English [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[county cricket]] has existed as the top tier of domestic cricket in England since the middle nineteenth century, and until the 1950s it was up to the highest standard of the game. Seasons have varied in length: before the 1880s, they were generally less than ten matches in length and some "first-class" counties played only against one or two different opponents, so that a team winning all its games was not implausible. Between [[1887 English cricket season|1887]] and [[1929 English cricket season|1929]], seasons were gradually increased in length to a standard twenty-eight matches for all counties. However, because of the development and popularity of one-day cricket, seasons have been reduced to twenty-four games in [[1969 English cricket season|1969]] and twenty in [[1972 English cricket season|1972]], though this was increased by two in [[1977 English cricket season|1977]] and [[1983 English cricket season|1983]]. With an increase to four days for all games, sixteen or seventeen games have been played since [[1993 English cricket season|1993]].

Also, because of improvements to pitches via the [[heavy roller]] and covering to protect from rain, the proportion of games "drawn" (not finished) has steadily risen since the 1870s.

Since tables of results have been kept in [[1864 English cricket season|1864]],&lt;ref name="rigby"&gt;Wynne-Thomas, Peter; ''The Rigby A-Z of Cricket Records''; pp. 53 to 67. {{ISBN|072701868X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only team to have competed a true perfect season – winning outright every game – was [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] in [[1867 English cricket season|1867]] when led by [[George Freeman (cricketer)|George Freeman's]] and [[Tom Emmett]]'s deadly fast bowling on uncovered and unrolled pitches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1867_f_Bowling_by_Average.html |title=First-Class bowling for Yorkshire in 1867 |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; they won all seven county games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/1867_f.html |title=Yorkshire 1867 season summary |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essex CCC achieved the feat in the Summer of 2017, with the bowling combination of Simon Harmer and Jamie Porter doing most of the damage. Ryan Ten Doeschate captained the side,

Since 1868 numerous county teams in longer schedules have finished a season unbeaten,&lt;ref name="rigby"/&gt; but none have managed to win every single game outright:

In 2011 and 2012, the [[Washington Kastles]] of [[World Team Tennis]] completed back-to-back perfect seasons, the first major sports franchise in the United States to do so. The Kastles swept each of the 2011 and 2012 regular seasons with a perfect 14–0 record, then in each season went on to win their two postseason games and league's championship, amassing a 32-game winning streak in the process. This streak stands one short of the all-time professional sports record in the United States by [[1971–72 Los Angeles Lakers season|the 1971–72 Los Angeles Lakers]].

The '''''Port-Royal Grammar''''' (originally ''Grammaire générale et raisonnée contenant les fondemens de l'art de parler, expliqués d'une manière claire et naturelle'', "General and Rational Grammar, containing the fundamentals of the art of speaking, explained in a clear and natural manner") was a pioneering work in the [[philosophy of language]]. Published in 1660 by [[Antoine Arnauld]] and [[Claude Lancelot]], it was the linguistic counterpart to the ''[[Port-Royal Logic]]'' (1662), both named after the [[Jansenist]] monastery of [[Port-Royal-des-Champs]] where their authors worked. The ''Grammar'' was heavily influenced by the ''[[Rules for the Direction of the Mind|Regulae]]'' of [[René Descartes]] and it has been held up as an example ''par excellence'' of [[Cartesian linguistics]] by [[Noam Chomsky]]. The central argument of the ''Grammar'' is that grammar is simply mental processes, which are universal; therefore [[Universal grammar|grammar is universal]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5057">A '''psychogram''' is a term sometimes used in fields within [[psychology]] such as [[personality]] theory and [[perception]] as well as [[graphology]] and handwriting analysis, although the term has multiple senses, many of them out-of-date, and none of the senses of the term are defined clearly or used consistently. One sense of the term is from psychological research in the middle of the twentieth century, meaning a composite psychological measurement which attempts to integrate various elements of a person's thought processes,&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster Dictionary, [http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/psychogram composite psychological measurement]&lt;/ref&gt; often a diagram, usually in the form of a circle. According to one source, in this sense, a psychogram denoted "not the sum of elements but their interrelationship" as a way to reduce "complex happenings to a simple design which enables the individual to make his decision."&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, Werner, (1950). Values and personality: An existential psychology of crisis, (pp. 123-127). New York City, NY, US: Grune &amp; Stratton, x, 240 pp, [http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=2005-00642-031 The psychogram], Retrieved November 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nevers J., 1959 Apr;10(4):222-33, (article in French), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13659290 The Rorschach test; elements of the psychogram], Retrieved November 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used by a few psychologists such as Daniel S. Anthony in the 1960s, {{PMID|13659290}}&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Runco, Steven R. Pritzker, Academic Press, 1999, Two-Volume Set, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cpc7CJH1-s8C&amp;dq=%22dan+anthony%22+psychogram&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Encyclopedia of Creativity]&lt;/ref&gt; It was used as a visual representation or "map" of an individual's [[personality]]. The term never caught on within the mainstream psychological academic establishment, possibly because there was no consistent sense of what psychograms were or how they should be used. There is a different, yet slightly related sense of the term, which refers to a specific system of handwriting analysis in the field of [[graphology]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel S Anthony, 1964, Newark, N.J., [http://www.worldcat.org/title/graphological-psychogram-psychological-meaning-of-its-sectors-and-symbolic-interpretation-of-its-graphic-indicators/oclc/83654215 The graphological psychogram : psychological meaning of its sectors and symbolic interpretation of its graphic indicators]&lt;/ref&gt; A third sense of the term has less emphasis on measuring personality and more on measuring psychological perception, with the term being used in conjunction with the [[Rorschach test|Rorschach inkblot projection technique]], so that the scores on various measures following a Rorschach test are combined into a summary of all the scored responses, called a psychogram.&lt;ref&gt;Yehudi A. Cohen, AldineTransaction, Jan 1, 1971, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTXwAQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%22Rorschach+psychogram%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Man in Adaptation: The Institutional Framework]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sol L.

'''Puripanda Appala Swamy''' (1904&amp;ndash;1982), also spelled '''Appalaswamy''', was a linguist, writer, translator, journalist and editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Litterateur's statue to be installed in city |newspaper=The Hindu |date=14 November 2005 |accessdate=2 August 2013 |url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/11/14/stories/2005111412940300.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born in [[Salur]], [[Vizianagaram district]] on 13 November 1904. After primary education, he learned [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Sanskrit]] and many other languages including [[Oriya language|Oriya]], [[Hindi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[English language|English]].

==Life==
He actively participated in [[Indian Freedom Movement]] particularly Non-cooperative movement, Harijan upliftment and Khadi Prachar movement.  He worked as organizer in All India Charaka Sangham at Visakhapatnam.

He published 'Vaisakhi', a monthly magazine with a praise from literary populace.

The credit of discovering the Mahakavi [[Sri Sri (writer)|Sri Sri]] should go to Puripanda, who identified him at young age and published his poems in his own journal.  Puripanda was his friend, phylosopher and guide as long as he lived. He took him to London and got his voice and handwriting recorded and published by Gutala Krishnamurthy. Sri Sri reciprocated this by translating the poems of Puripanda into English and remained his lifelong friend and admirer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l05YvECvJ2sC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=Puripanda&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1ghhxLhvy2&amp;sig=GPoi5yJ3MovOr3M-y9XlBZbDGCs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2693StfTL5ng7APsleiVBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;q=Puripanda&amp;f=false Mahakavi Srisri: Life and Works of Srirangam Srinivasa Rao by Būdarāju Rādhākr̥ṣṇa.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''quill''' [[pen]] is a [[writing implement]] made from a moulted [[flight feather]] (preferably a primary wing-feather) of a large [[bird]]. Quills were used for [[writing]] with [[ink]] before the invention of the [[dip pen]], the metal-[[Nib (pen)|nib]]bed pen, the [[fountain pen]], and, eventually, the [[ballpoint pen]]. The hand-cut goose quill is rarely used as a [[Western calligraphy|calligraphy]] tool, because many papers are now derived from [[Pulp (paper)|wood pulp]] and wear down the quill very quickly. However, it is still the tool of choice for a few scribes who noted that quills provide an unmatched sharp stroke as well as greater flexibility than a steel pen. 

==Description==
In a carefully prepared quill the slit does not widen through wetting and drying with ink. It will retain its shape adequately and only requires infrequent sharpening and can be used time and time again until there is little left of it. The hollow shaft of the feather (the ''calamus'') acts as an ink reservoir and ink flows to the tip by [[capillary action]]. 

==Sources==
The strongest quills come from the primary flight feathers discarded by birds during their annual moult. Generally feathers from the left wing (it is supposed) is favored by the [[Right-handedness|right-handed]] majority of British writers because the feather curves away from the sight line, over the back of the hand. The quill barrel is cut to six or seven inches in length, so no such consideration of curvature or 'sight-line' is necessary. Additionally, writing with the left-hand in the long era of the quill was discouraged, and quills were never sold as left and right-handed, only by their size and species. 

[[Goose]] feathers are most commonly used; scarcer, more expensive [[swan]] feathers are used for larger lettering. Depending on availability and strength of the feather, as well as quality and characteristic of the line wanted by the writer, other feathers used for quill-pen making include those from the [[crow (bird)|crow]], [[eagle]], [[owl]], [[hawk]], and [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]]. On a true quill, the [[barb (feather)|barbs]] are stripped off completely on the trailing edge. (The pinion for example only has significant barbs on one side of the barrel.) Later, a fashion developed for stripping partially and leaving a decorative top of a few barbs. The fancy, fully plumed quill is mostly a Hollywood invention and has little basis in reality. Most, if not all, manuscript illustrations of scribes show a quill devoid of decorative barbs, or at least mostly stripped.&lt;ref name="Hanson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thor Hanson|title=Feathers: The Evolution of a Natural Miracle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTwkoOOSvBoC|date=31 July 2012|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-02878-8|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Quill pens were used to write the vast majority of medieval manuscripts, including the [[Magna Carta]] and the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. 
Quill pens are still used today mainly by professional scribes and calligraphers.

Quills are also used as the [[plectrum]] material in [[string instruments]], particularly the [[harpsichord]].&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Quill|author=John Koster|access-date=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:The bookkeeper by van Dijk.jpg|thumb|left|Sharpening a quill]]
Quills were the primary writing instrument in the western world from the 6th to the 19th century. The best quills were usually made from goose, swan, and later turkey feathers. Quills went into decline after the invention of the metal [[pen]], mass production beginning in Great Britain as early as 1822 by John Mitchell of Birmingham.

Quill pens were the instrument of choice during the [[medieval era]] due to their compatibility with [[parchment]] and vellum.  Before this the [[reed pen]] had been used, but a finer letter was achieved on animal skin using a cured quill. Other than written text, they were often used to create figures, decorations, and images on [[manuscript]]s, although many illuminators and painters preferred fine brushes for their work. The variety of different strokes in formal hands was accomplished by good penmanship as the tip was square cut and rigid, exactly as it is today with modern steel pens.

It was much later, in the 1600s, with the increased popularity of writing, especially in the [[copperplate script]] promoted by the many printed manuals available from the 'Writing Masters', that quills became more pointed and flexible.

According to the [[Supreme Court Historical Society]], 20 goose-quill pens, neatly crossed, are placed at the four counsel tables each day the U.S. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] is in session; "most lawyers appear before the Court only once, and gladly take the quills home as [[souvenir]]s."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.supremecourthistory.org/how-the-court-works/how-the-court-work/oral-argument/ How the court works]." Supreme Court Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been done since the earliest sessions of the Court.&lt;ref&gt;"[{{SCOTUS URL|about/traditions.pdf}} The Court and Its Traditions]." [[Supreme Court of the United States]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Quills are denominated from the order in which they are fixed in the wing; the first is favoured by the expert calligrapher, the second and third quills being very satisfactory also, plus the pinion feather. Flags the 5th and 6th feathers are also used. No other feather on the wing would be considered suitable by a professional [[scribe]].

Information can be obtained on the techniques of curing and cutting quills&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Child|first=Heather|title=The Calligraphers Handbook|publisher=A &amp; C Black UK|year=1985|isbn=0-7136-2695-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to harden a quill that is soft, thrust the barrel into hot ashes, stirring it till it is soft; then taking it out, press it almost flat upon your knees with the back of a penknife, and afterwards reduce it to a roundness with your fingers. If you have a number to harden, set water and alum over the fire; and while it is boiling put in a handful of quills, the barrels only, for a minute, and then lay them by.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 6th edition, 1823.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An accurate account of the Victorian process by William Bishop, from researches with one of the last London quill dressers, is recorded in the ''Calligrapher's Handbook'' cited on this page.

==Today==
[[File:Quill (PSF) vector.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Line art]] representation of a quill pen]]
A quill knife was the original primary tool used for cutting and sharpening quills, known as "dressing".

Following the decline of the quill in the 1820s, after the introduction of the maintenance-free, mass-produced steel dip nib by John Mitchell, knives were still manufactured but became known as desk knives, stationery knives or latterly as the name stuck [[pen knife|"pen" knives]]. 

A "pen" knife by contrast has two flat sides. This distinction is not recognised by modern traders, dealers or collectors, who define a quill knife as any small knife with a fixed or hinged blade, including such items as ornamental fruit knives.

==Music==
[[Plectrum|Plectra]] for [[psaltery|psalteries]] and [[lute]]s can be cut similarly to writing pens. The [[rachis]], the portion of the stem between the barbs, not the calamus, of the primary flight feathers of birds of the [[crow family]] was preferred for harpsichords. In modern instruments, plastic is more common, but they are often still called "quills".&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; The [[lesiba]] uses a quill attached to a string to produce sound.

==Possible referents==
Candidate [[referent]]s for the use date back to at least the 19th century.  The following are possibilities of the term's origin.

* '''Euphemism for the devil:''' [[H. L. Mencken]] suggested that the phrase derives from [[Samael|Samiel]], the name of the [[Devil]] in ''[[Der Freischütz]]'', an opera by [[Carl Maria von Weber]] that was performed in [[New York City]] in 1825.  The phrase "Sa' m Hill" can also be seen in the variant "Samil."&lt;ref name="mencken"&gt;{{cite book| last=Mencken |first=H. L. |authorlink=H. L. Mencken| title=[[The American Language]] |edition=4th |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Store owner in Arizona:''' Sam Hill was also a mercantile store owner who offered a vast and diverse inventory of goods. People began using the term "what in the Sam Hill is that?" to describe something they found odd or unusual, just like the inventory found in Sam Hill's store.  The original Sam Hill Mercantile building still stands on Montezuma Street in [[Prescott, Arizona]], and is listed on the register of Historic Places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hill, Sam, Hardware|url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=7a21d00b-c28a-4139-8abc-aada9d201d5b|website=National Register of Historic Places|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Politician in Connecticut:''' An article in the ''New England Magazine'' in December 1889 entitled "Two Centuries and a Half in [[Guilford, Connecticut]]" mentioned that, "Between 1727 and 1752 Mr. Sam. Hill represented Guilford in forty-three out of forty-nine sessions of the Legislature, and when he was gathered to his fathers, his son Nathaniel reigned in his stead" and a footnote queried whether this might be the source of the "popular Connecticut [[oath|adjuration]] to 'Give 'em Sam Hill'?"&lt;ref name="world wide words"/&gt;

* '''Surveyor in Michigan:''' A possible origin for the phrase "Sam Hill" is the surveyor Samuel W. Hill (1819–1889), associated with the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]] area.&lt;ref name="samhill.origin1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.livinggoldpress.com/SamHillSignBig.jpg |title=Sam Hill Sign |author=Jill Livingston, 1999, 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hill allegedly used such foul language that his name became a euphemism for swear words. In the words of Charles Eschbach, "Back in the 1850s the Keweenaw's copper mining boom was underway. There were about a dozen men who pretty much ran the Keweenaw. They were mining company agents, the 'go between' for the investors from Boston and the actual mining production people. Their names were attached to every report sent back to eastern investors. Among these company agents was a man named Samuel W. Hill.

Courter, Samuel Hill "was an adventurer, explorer, miner, and surveyor. He had worked with Christopher C. Douglas and Douglas Houghton on the early State survey. His judgment was respected. Although he was a rough character, he possessed a big heart and in the fall of 1847 had risked his life to help avert a threatened food shortage in the Copper Harbor district. Generally he was regarded as a hero throughout the entire Copper Country, however, he was contemptuous of all the praise that was heaped upon him. Hill also gained a reputation as being one of the most blasphemous and obscene swearers in the Keweenaw Peninsula. Although he had a colorful vocabulary and told many a good story of his early adventures, his ubiquitous use of lurid cuss words became legendary. Whenever friends or neighbors retold his colorful tales in more polite society, they had to tame his unmentionables by substituting the sinless sounding words 'Sam Hill'. In time the expression, 'What the Sam Hill' spread far beyond the Copper Country. Today it has become a part of the American language. Few who utter these words ever heard of Samuel Hill, or know that he was the unconscious originator of a sinless synonym for profanity."&lt;ref name="Courter"&gt;{{cite book |last=Courter |first=Ellis W. |title=Michigan's Copper Country |publisher=Republished by the State of Michigan, Office of Geological Survey |year=2005 |url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/deq/CMG92_301731_7.pdf

*'''Adjutant General in Kentucky:''' Another possibility involves the former [[adjutant general]] of [[Kentucky]] Samuel Ewing Hill, who was sent by the governor of Kentucky to see what was going on in reference to the [[Hatfields &amp; McCoys]] family feud in 1887. Between 1880 and 1891, the feud claimed more than a dozen members of the two families, becoming headline news around the country, and compelling the governors of both Kentucky and [[West Virginia]] to call up their [[state militia]]s to restore order. The governor of West Virginia once even threatened to have his militia invade Kentucky. Kentucky governor [[Simon Bolivar Buckner]] in response sent his adjutant general Sam Hill to [[Pike County, Kentucky]] to investigate the situation. Newspapers from around the country awaited word from Hill to find out "what in the Sam Hill was going on up there".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What in Sam Hill ... started the Hatfield and McCoy Feud?|url=http://kynghistory.ky.gov/history/3qtr/addinfo/hatfieldmccoy.htm|publisher=Kentucky.gov|accessdate=3 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604010759/http://kynghistory.ky.gov/history/3qtr/addinfo/hatfieldmccoy.htm|archivedate=4 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hatfields and McCoys: The Moran Connection|url=http://moranfamilytn.blogspot.com/2012/06/hatfields-and-mccoys-moran-connection.html|publisher=moranfamilytn.blogspot.com|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shipibo''' (also '''Shipibo-Conibo''', '''Shipibo-Konibo''') is a [[Panoan]] language spoken in [[Peru]] and [[Brazil]] by approximately 26,000 speakers. Shipibo is an [[official language]] of Peru.

==Dialects==
[[File:Shipibo jar (UBC-2010)a.jpg|thumb|150px|A Shipibo jar]]
Shipibo has three attested dialects:

*Shipibo and Konibo (Conibo), which have merged
*Kapanawa of the Tapiche River, which is obsolescent

Extinct Xipináwa (Shipinawa) is thought to have been a dialect as well, but there is no linguistic data (Fleck 2013).

O.|title=One child, two languages: A guide for preschool educators of children, learning English as a second language.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the silent period has received a lot of endorsement from researchers and educators, some argue against the validity of such a period. There are debates surrounding its significance in language acquisition, of how language teachers should address such a period in school curriculum, and what exactly language learners are processing (or not) during such a period.

== Controversy ==
There is controversy as to whether there is such a defined silent period of active learning. Studies in support of a silent period have used variable methods and definitions of silence.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=T. A.|title=Not so silent after all: Examination and analysis of the silent stage in childhood second language acquisition|journal=Early Childhood Research Quarterly|date=2014|volume=29|issue=1|page=22-40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some define it as the absence of any L2, while others define it as the absence of productive syntax in L2. Moreover, these studies were conducted across variable settings, and report a big range in the length of silent periods. Ultimately, even if these studies did properly established a non-verbal phase, there is still a lack of evidence that it involves active learning, as opposed to general incomprehension or shyness.
The general concept of the silent period also seems at odds with the communicative nature of language and language acquisition.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;

== In language teaching ==
General support for a silent period of active learning leads to certain implications in language teaching. Educators are less likely to expect engagement from L2 learners early on in acquisition, and might not try to elicit speech from L2 learners. However, if the silent period is not empirically founded, or if it reflects general incomprehension or shyness rather than active learning, then these pedagogical methods have to be reevaluated.

The silent period has been used in [[language teaching methods]] such as [[Total Physical Response]], the [[natural approach]], and [[Automatic Language Growth]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24628">A '''six-bit character code''' is a [[character encoding]] designed for use on computers with [[word length]]s a multiple of 6. Six bits can only encode 64 distinct characters, so these codes generally include only the upper-case letters, the numerals, some punctuation characters, and sometimes control characters. Such codes with additional [[parity bit]] were a natural way of storing data on [[IBM 7 track|7-track]] [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]].

==Types of six-bit codes==
An early six-bit binary code was used for [[Braille]], the reading system for the blind that was developed in the 1820s.

The earliest computers dealt with numeric data only, and made no provision for character data. [[Six-bit BCD]] was used by [[IBM]] on early computers such as the [[IBM 704]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=IBM Corporation |title=704 electronic data-processing machine: manual of operation |date=1954 |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/704/24-6661-2_704_Manual_1955.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.35}} This encoding was replaced by the 8-bit [[EBCDIC]] code when [[System/360]] standardized on 8-bit [[byte]]s. There are some variants of this type of code (see [[#Examples of BCD six-bit codes|below]]).

Six-bit character codes generally succeeded the five-bit [[Baudot code]] and preceded seven-bit [[ASCII]]. One popular variant was [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] SIXBIT. This is simply the ASCII character codes from 32 to 95 coded as 0 to 63 by subtracting 32 (i.e., columns 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the ASCII table (16 characters to a column), shifted to columns 0 through 3, by subtracting 2 from the high bits); it includes the space, punctuation characters, numbers, and capital letters, but no control characters. Since it included no control characters, not even end-of-line, it was not used for general text processing. However, six-character names such as [[filename]]s and [[assembly language|assembler]] [[identifier|symbol]]s could be stored in a single [[36-bit]] word of [[PDP-10]], and three characters fit in each word of the [[PDP-1]] and two characters fit in each word of the [[PDP-8]].

Six-bit codes could encode more than 64 characters by the use of [[Shift Out and Shift In characters]], essentially incorporating two distinct 62-character sets and switching between them. For example, the popular [[IBM 2741]] communications terminal supported a variety of character sets of up to 88 printing characters plus control characters.

A [[UTF-6]] encoding was proposed for [[Comparison of Unicode encodings|Unicode]]&lt;ref name="UTF-6"&gt;{{cite web |author-last1=Welter |author-first1=Mark |author-last2=Spolarich |author-first2=Brian W. |title=UTF-6 - Yet Another ASCII-Compatible Encoding for ID |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-idn-utf6-00 |website=Internet Engineering Task Force |date=2000-11-16 |access-date=2016-04-09 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523174347/https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-idn-utf6-00 |archive-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was superseded by [[Punycode]].

===BCD six-bit code===
Six-bit [[BCD (6-bit)|BCD]] code was the adaptation of the [[punched card code]] to [[binary code]]. [[IBM]] applied the terms ''binary-coded decimal'' and ''BCD'' to the variations of BCD ''alphamerics'' used in most early IBM computers, including the [[IBM 1620]], [[IBM 1400 series]], and non-[[IBM 700/7000 series#Decimal architecture (7070/7072/7074)|Decimal Architecture]] members of the [[IBM 700/7000 series]].

===COBOL databases six-bit code===
A six-bit code was also used in COBOL databases, where end-of-record information was stored separately.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Magnetic stripe card six-bit code===
A six-bit code, with added odd [[parity bit]], is used on Track 1 of [[magnetic stripe card]]s, as specified in [[ISO/IEC 7811]]-2.

==={{anchor|ECMA-1}}DEC six-bit code===
A DEC SIXBIT code including a few control characters &amp;mdash; along with [[Shift Out and Shift In characters|SO/SI]], allowing code extension &amp;mdash; was specified as [[Ecma International|ECMA]]-[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-WITHDRAWN/ECMA-1,%201st%20Edition,%20March%201963.pdf 1] in 1963 (see [[#Example of six-bit ASCII variants|below]]). Another, less common, variant is obtained by just stripping the high bit of an ASCII code in 32 - 95 range (codes 32 - 63 remain at their positions, higher values have 64 subtracted from them). Such variant was sometimes used on DEC's [[PDP-8]] (1965).

===FIELDATA six-bit code===
[[FIELDATA]] was a seven-bit code (with optional parity) of which only 64 code positions (occupying six bits) were formally defined.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie_1980"&gt;{{cite book |title=Coded Character Sets, History and Development |work=The Systems Programming Series |author-last=Mackenzie |author-first=Charles E. |year=1980 |edition=1 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc.]] |isbn=0-201-14460-3 |lccn=77-90165 |page=64 |id={{ISBN|978-0-201-14460-4}} |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-tQAAAAMAAJ |access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant was used by [[UNIVAC]]'s 1100-series computers.&lt;ref name="Walker_1996"&gt;{{cite web |title=UNIVAC 1100 Series FIELDATA Code |work=UNIVAC Memories |author-first=John |author-last=Walker |date=1996-08-06 |url=https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/univac/fieldata.html |access-date=2016-05-22 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522120813/https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/univac/fieldata.html |archive-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treating the code as a six-bit code these systems used a 36-bit word (capable of storing 6 such reduced FIELDATA characters).&lt;ref name="Jennings_2016"&gt;{{cite web |title=An annotated history of some character codes or ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Infiltration |author-first=Thomas Daniel |author-last=Jennings |author-link=Thomas Daniel Jennings |website=World Power Systems (WPS) |date=2016-04-20 |orig-year=1999 |url=http://worldpowersystems.com/J/codes/#FIELDATA |access-date=2016-05-22 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522024759/http://worldpowersystems.com/J/codes/#FIELDATA |archive-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Braille six-bit code===
[[Braille]] characters are represented using six dot positions, arranged in a rectangle. Each position may contain a raised dot or not, so Braille can be considered to be a six-bit binary code.

==Six-bit codes for binary-to-text encoding==
{{SeeAlso|Binary-to-text encoding}}
Transmission of binary data over systems which are designed for text only can sometimes introduce problems. For example, [[email]] historically supported only 7-bit ASCII codes and would strip the 8th bit, thus corrupting binary data sent directly through any troublesome mail server.  Other systems can cause issues by improperly interpreting control characters during storage or transmission.
A number of schemes exist to pack 8-bit data into text-only representations which can pass through text mail systems, to be decoded at the destination. Examples of 6-bit character subsets used for packing binary data include [[Uuencode]] and [[Base64]]. These sets contain no control characters (only printable numbers, letters, some punctuation, and maybe space) and allow data to be transmitted over any medium which is also able to transmit human-readable text.

Maha vidhwan Thirumaaligai Appan Narayana Iyengar was born to Thirumaaligai Appan Iyengar and Shenkamalavalli Ammal on 31 Oct 1861 in EthirkOtai near [[Srivilliputhur]]. After having learnt the basics of Tamil literature and grammar from his father Appan Iyengar and other scholars near his home town during his formative years, he moved to [[Ramanathapuram]].

== Initial years and education ==
Iyengar learnt Sankrit literature and grammar from Pandalkudi Venkatachariar, [[tarka sastra]] from Samaacharyar and Vaishnava literature including [[Naalayira Divya Prabhandham]] from Sidhadikkaadu Srinivasachariar. He also learnt the Shaiva literature like Sivagyana bodham, Sivagyaana Sidhiyaar, [[Thevaaram]], [[Tiruvasakam]] from Palanikumara Thambiraan of Thiruvaavaduthurai Aadheenam.&lt;ref name=Dinamani&gt;{{cite news|last1=A. K|first1=Selvaganapathy|title=Senthamizh Asiririyar Narayana Iyengar|url=http://www.dinamani.com/weekly_supplements/tamil_mani/article1008664.ece|publisher=Dinamani|date=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He, along with Paandithurai Thevar, zamindar of Paalavanatham did their residential education with Sadavadhaanam Muthuswamy Iyengar, father of [[Raghava Iyengar|Mu Raghava Iyengar]].&lt;ref name=Dinamani /&gt; During his education, his versatility in both Sanskrit and Tamil literature, his knowledge of Astrology, medicine and [[tarka sastra]] impressed Paandithurai Thevar so much that he made him his official poet.

== Literary work ==

Iyengar translated the Sanskrit literature "Jaathakachandrika", a text on horoscope study in to Tamil ([[venpa]] yaappu) quartet poems on the request of the zamindar. This work was published and released by the zamindar in his court.&lt;ref name=Dinamani /&gt;

Iyengar also helped Paandithurai Thevar in publishing the Panoorthirattu.&lt;ref name=Dinamani1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rama|first1=Ponnappan|title=Muduperum Pulavar Thiru Narayana Iyengar|publisher=Dinamani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Paandithurai Thevar established the Madurai Tamil Sangam on 24 May 1901, he assigned Iyengar management responsibilities in the Sangam for which he moved to Madurai.

Iyengar was in the management team of the Madurai Tamil Sangam since its inception. He was the &lt;ref name="Senthamil College Report1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Senthamil College Report|url=http://www.senthamilcollege.org/ssr2.pdf|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; first head of the Senthamil College institution and performed it for 45 years. Apart from that he also performed other functions – administrator, editor of Senthamizh magazine. Thiru Narayana Iyengar was the editor of the Senthamizh monthly from 1911.&lt;ref name="Senthamil College Report2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Senthamil College Report|url=http://www.senthamilcollege.org/ssr2.pdf|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; until his passing away in 1947.

It was during this period as Senthamizh editor that he did many research works in Tamil and Sanskrit literature and published his works in the monthly journal. His articles in the Senthamizh magazine on literature - Tamil and Sanskrit, grammar, tarka sastra, history and religion were informative to the readers. His expertise in these topics, his unbiased position in assessing the different points of view, his fearlessness to state the facts were well commended by the readers of Senthamizh.&lt;ref name=IllakiaPeedam2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A|first1=Rajagopalan|title=Muduperum Pulavar Thiru Narayana Iyengar|journal=Illakia Peedam|date=November 2008|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published many such works in the magazine and which were later published as books.

In 1938, Iyengar wrote a paper titled Valmiki and Tamil in Senthamizh monthly, which analysed Maharishi Valmiki’s relationship with Tamil and whether Tamil could have been the spoken language throughout India during the Ramayana times.&lt;ref name=Dinamani2&gt;{{cite news|last1=n|first1=d|title=Intha Vaaram Kalarasikan|url=http://www.dinamani.com/weekly_supplements/tamil_mani/2013/10/06/%E0%AE%87%E0%AE%A8%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4-%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%A9%E0%AF%8D/article1820935.ece|publisher=Dinamani|date=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work Bharathazhwan Vaibhavam in the Senthamizh magazine was discussed in the Tamil literary circles. In that work, the detailed meaning given by Thiru Narayana Iyengar for the Kamban song that begins "Vanthethire thozhuthaanai" were refuted by Naavalar Somasundara Bharathiar. Thiru Narayana Iyengar’s reply to that rebuttal with detailed grammatical explanations and poetic nuances are even today a feast for the lovers of the Tamil language.&lt;ref name=IllakiaPeedam2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A|first1=Rajagopalan|title=Muduperum Pulavar Thiru Narayana Iyengar|journal=Illakia Peedam|date=November 2008|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published both Naavalar’s objections and his explanations in the Senthamizh magazine.

He was in the education advisory committee of the Madras University, Annamalai University and the Yaazhpaana Arya Dravida Bhasha Abiviruthi Sangam.&lt;ref name=IllakiaPeedam&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A|first1=Rajagopalan|title=Muduperum Pulavar Thiru Narayana Iyengar|journal=Illakia Peedam|date=November 2008|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was dedicated to Madurai Tamil Sangam and loyal to Paandithurai Thevar that he did not take up opportunities that came to him from other universities.

During the 80th birthday celebrations of [[U. V. Swaminatha Iyer|Ue. Ve. Swaminatha Iyer]], Iyengar requested him to write his autobiography&lt;ref name=Dinamani2 /&gt; and that encouraged [[U. V. Swaminatha Iyer|Ue. Ve. Swaminatha Iyer]] to write "என் சரித்திரம்". When [[U. V. Swaminatha Iyer|Ue. Ve. Swaminatha Iyer]] retired from Annamalai University, Annamalai Chettiar requested Thiru Narayana Iyengar to join the university. Although more remunerative and in spite of [[U. V. Swaminatha Iyer|Ue. Ve. Swaminatha Iyer]] requesting him, Thiru Narayana Iyengar turned it down&lt;ref name=Dinamani2 /&gt; since he derived very high satisfaction from his work at the Madurai Tamil Sangam. In his reply to Thiru Narayana Iyengar, Swaminatha Iyer quoted Thiruvalluvar’s kural  - "வேண்டாமை அன்ன விழுச்செல்வம்"&lt;ref name=IllakiaPeedam1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A|first1=Rajagopalan|title=Muduperum Pulavar Thiru Narayana Iyengar|journal=Illakia Peedam|date=November 2008|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said that he was the one with the greatest asset – needlessness.

Here below are what some of the various Tamil literati had to say about him:

Naavalar Somasundara Bharathiar said of him&lt;ref name=Dinamani1 /&gt; – "நிரம்பிய இருமொழிக் கல்வியும் வரம்பளந்த அளவை நூலறிவும், நுண்மதியும், நடுவுநிலை திறம்பாத உளச் செம்மையும், சாந்த சீலமும் வாய்ந்த பெரியார் - a respectable elder with complete dual language knowledge, boundless knowledge of the books, refined sharp intelligence, unwavering judiciousness and equanimous".

&lt;ref name=IllakiaPeedam /&gt;"இருமொழிப் பயிற்சியிலும், இலக்கணம் தர்க்கம் ஆகிய துறைகளிலும் அவரைப் போன்ற வித்வான்களைப் பார்க்க முடியாது - It is difficult to see an expert as good as him in dual language knowledge, grammar and logical reasoning" said the head of the department of Tamil in Madras University, [[S. Vaiyapuri Pillai|Rao Sahib Thiru S. Vaiyapuri Pillai]].

&lt;ref name=IllakiaPeedam /&gt;"ஆசிரியர் செந்தமிழ் இதழில் வெளியிட்ட பொருளுரைகள் தமிழ்மொழி வளர்ச்சிக்கு இன்றியமையாதன - Senthamizh editor’s essays with detailed meanings were an important contribution for the growth of the Tamil language" so said Sunnaakam A Kumaarasaami Pulavar.

[[Raghava Iyengar|Mu Raghava Iyengar]] of the Madurai Tamil Sangam had said &lt;ref name=Dinamani /&gt;"நூற்றுக் கணக்கான மாணவர்களுக்கு தமிழறிவூட்டி அக்கல்வித் துறையைப் பரவச் செய்து தமிழக குலபதியாக விளங்கியவர் - Thiru Narayana Iyengar instilled the knowledge of Tamil literature to hundreds of students, was responsible for the growth of Tamil literature and can be called the leader".

== Recognition ==

1896 – During Queen Victoria Jubilee celebrations he won accolades for his contributions to Tamil from the Deputy-Collector Rajaramaiyya&lt;ref name=IllakiaPeedam /&gt;

1922 Jan 13 Madras government awarded him a golden armlet, gold medal and shawl from the Prince of Wales for his literary eminence in Tamil&lt;ref name=Dinamani2 /&gt;

1934 for the 33rd anniversary of Madurai Tamil Sangam, awarded the cash prize and shawl for his contributions to Tamil Sangam by the Governor of Chennai Muhamad Usman Sahib Bahadur&lt;ref name=IllakiaPeedam&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A|first1=Rajagopalan|title=Muduperum Pulavar Thiru Narayana Iyengar|journal=Illakia Peedam|date=November 2008|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="78542">{{short description|Wikimedia list article about CSS, color, and the X11 system}}
In [[computing]], on the [[X Window System]], '''X11 color names''' are represented in a simple text file, which maps certain strings to [[RGB]] [[color]] values. It was traditionally shipped with every [[X11]] installation, hence the name, and is usually located in &lt;code&gt;''&amp;lt;X11root&amp;gt;''/lib/X11/rgb.txt&lt;/code&gt;. The [[web colors]] list is descended from it but differs for certain color names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/10/tomato-versus-ff6347-the-tragicomic-history-of-css-color-names/ | title="Tomato" versus "#FF6347"—the tragicomic history of CSS color names | work=Ars Technica | date=October 11, 2015 | accessdate=October 11, 2015 | first=Julianne | last=Tveten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Color names are not standardized by Xlib or the X11 protocol. The list does not show continuity either in selected [[color value]]s or in [[color name]]s, and some color triplets have multiple names. Despite this, graphic designers and others got used to them, making it practically impossible to introduce a different list. In earlier releases of X11 (prior to the introduction of [[Xcms]]), server implementors were encouraged to modify the RGB values in the reference color database to account for gamma correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Adrian|title=Xlib programming manual : for version 11 of the X Window System|year=1990|publisher=O'Reilly &amp; Associates|location=[Sebastapol, CA]|isbn=0-937175-11-0|edition=2nd ed. covers release 3 and release 4, major revisions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of X.Org Release 7.4 rgb.txt is no longer included in the roll up release,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xorg.freedesktop.org/wiki/Releases/ModuleVersions/|title=ModuleVersions|accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the list is built directly into the server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/commit/?id=dda10c9066a660b647384179f82e1da8e063264f|title=Remove all traces of external RGB database (and Speedo)|date=5 November 2007|last=Stone|first=Daniel|accessdate=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The optional module xorg/app/rgb contains the stand-alone rgb.txt file.

The list first shipped with X10 release 3 (X10R3) on 7 June 1986, having been checked into [[Revision Control System|RCS]] by [[Jim Gettys]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~alanc/xc-historical/log/xc/programs/rgb/rgb.txt|title=~alanc/xc-historical - Partial/incomplete import of X consortium historical RCS up to X11R6.0|work=freedesktop.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same list was in X11R1 on 18 September 1987. Approximately the full list as is available today shipped with X11R4 on 29 January 1989, with substantial additions by Paul Ravelling (who added colors based on Sinclair Paints samples), John C. Thomas (who added colors based on a set of 72 [[Crayola]] [[crayons]] he had on hand) and Jim Fulton (who reconciled contributions to produce the X11R4 list). The project was running [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VT240]] terminals at the time, so would have worked to that device.&lt;ref name=w3-2014&gt;{{cite web|url=//lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Mar/0272.html|first=Alex|last=Sexton|date=12 March 2014|accessdate=12 March 2014|title=Last call comments on CSS3 module: color|work=www-style@w3.org mailing list|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some applications multipart names are written with spaces, in others joined together, often in [[camel case]]. They are usually matched insensitive of case and the X Server source code contains spaced aliases for most entries; this article uses spaces and uppercase initials except where variants with spaces are not specified in the actual code.

== Clashes between web and X11 colors in the CSS color scheme ==

The first versions of [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] and [[Netscape Navigator]] used the X11 colors as the basis for the [[web colors]] list, as both were originally X applications. The [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] specifications [[SVG]] and [[CSS|CSS level 3 module Color]] eventually adopted the X11 list with some changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wp.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/3.0/handbook/javascript/colors.htm |title=Netscape.com |publisher=Wp.netscape.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present W3C list is a superset of the 16 “[[VGA]] colors” defined in [[HTML 3.2]] and CSS level 1.

Perhaps most unusual of the color clashes between X11 and W3C is the case of "Gray" and its variants. In HTML, "Gray" is specifically reserved for the 128 triplet (50% gray) {{color sample|rgb(128,128,128)}}. However, in X11, "gray" was assigned to the 190 triplet (74.5%) {{color sample|rgb(190, 190, 190)}}, which is close to W3C "Silver" at 192 (75.3%) {{color sample|silver}}, and had "Light Gray" at 211 (83%) {{color sample|rgb(211,211,211)}} and "Dark Gray" at 169 (66%) {{color sample|rgb(169,169,169)}} counterparts. As a result, the combined CSS 3.0 color list that prevails on the web today produces "Dark Gray" {{color sample|rgb(169,169,169)}} as a significantly lighter tone than plain "Gray" {{color sample|rgb(128,128,128)}}, because "Dark Gray" was descended from X11 – for it did not exist in HTML nor CSS level 1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1/|title=Cascading Style Sheets, level 1|website=www.w3.org|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; – while "Gray" was descended from HTML. Even in the current draft for CSS 4.0, dark gray continues to be a lighter shade than gray.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/|title=CSS Color Module Level 4|website=drafts.csswg.org|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some browsers such as Netscape Navigator insisted on an "a" in any "Gr''a''y" except for "Light Gr''e''y".

Recent X releases also support the W3C definitions. In X11, the original definitions have been preserved (so "Dark Gray" remains a darker shade of "Gray"), but for every conflicting name pair, "Web" and additional "X11" prefixes have been added to ease disambiguation after the merger. The "X11" prefix is an alias for the non-prefixed version, i.e. "X11 Gray" = "Gray" ≠ "Web Gray". The W3C also defined a color that is equal to X11's "Green", but called it "Lime". In X11, this is simply called "Lime", as no such name existed before. It aliases to "Green", i.e. "Lime" = "Green" = "X11 Green" ≠ "Web Green".

== Color name chart ==
The following chart presents the standardized X11 color names from the X.org source code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/rgb/tree/rgb.txt Current official &lt;code&gt;rgb.txt&lt;/code&gt;] from the X.org source tree at Freedesktop.org&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Web colors|list of names accepted by browsers]] following [[World Wide Web Consortium|&lt;!--(likely duplicate link, but other articles link to this section)--&gt;W3C]] standards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-svg/2002Apr/0052.html |title=Lists.w3.org |publisher=w3.org |date=April 2002 |accessdate=2013-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; slightly differs as explained above. The table does not show numbered gray and brightness variants as described below. Actual &lt;code&gt;rgb.txt&lt;/code&gt; files and other color databases or palettes may differ since they are freely editable by vendors and users. The table shows component values in several notations of the RGB color space, i.e. [[RGB color model|RGB]], [[HSL and HSV]], conversions are done assuming [[sRGB]] color space.

== Color variations ==

=== Shades of gray ===
The complete &lt;code&gt;rgb.txt&lt;/code&gt; defines 101 shades from 'Gray0' (black) up to 'Gray100' (white) in addition to 'Gray' and its variants listed above. The shades are apparently defined by the formula &lt;code&gt;Gray''N'' := round(''N''% × 255)&lt;/code&gt; resulting in e.g. 'Gray96' {{color sample|#F5F5F5}}, which happens to be the same as 'White Smoke'. Similarly 'Dim Gray' is the same as 'Gray41' {{color sample|#696969}}.

On the other hand, 'Gray' {{color sample|#BEBEBE}} lies between 'Gray74' {{color sample|#BDBDBD}} and 'Gray75' {{color sample|#BFBFBF}}; 'Dark Gray' {{color sample|#A9A9A9}} is not the same as 'Gray66' {{color sample|#A8A8A8}}; and 'Light Gray' {{color sample|#D3D3D3}} is not the same as 'Gray83' {{color sample|#D4D4D4}}.

These shades are not included in W3C specifications, although drafts for level 4 of the CSS Color module include a similar function &lt;code&gt;gray()&lt;/code&gt;.
They are still coded without 'Grey' alternatives, but with no space before the digit.

=== Numbered variants ===
For 78 colors (not counting grays), &lt;code&gt;rgb.txt&lt;/code&gt; offers four variants "''color''1", "''color''2", "''color''3", and "''color''4", with "''color''1" sometimes corresponding to "''color''", so e.g. "Snow1" is the same as "Snow". Unlike base colors, e.g. &lt;code&gt;cadet blue&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CadetBlue&lt;/code&gt;, these are only coded without spaces, e.g. &lt;code&gt;CadetBlue3&lt;/code&gt;. These variations are neither supported by popular browsers nor adopted by W3C standards. Whether or not a certain color has such variants seems random.

If "''color''1" is not the same as "''color''{{-"}}, the base color is usually darker. That means its brightness in [[HSL and HSV|HSB]] color notation is less than 100%; about 30 of the base colors are fully bright. The four variants (1…4) have rounded brightness values of 100%, 93%, 80% and 55%, respectively. Their hue and saturation are usually the same except for rounding. In some cases they differ from the base color, though, which may indicate that these variants were specified  with alternate definitions of the bases in mind, i.e. their values were adapted to a certain monitor which was commonly done by vendors until the 1990s.

The fixed brightness settings correspond closely to these formulae to determine the RGB values:
:&lt;code&gt;''color''1 := ''color'' × 100%&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;''color''2 := ''color''1 × 93.2%&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;''color''3 := ''color''1 × 80.4%&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;''color''4 := ''color''1 × 54.8%&lt;/code&gt;

Examples:
* {{color sample|#EEEE00}} "Yellow 2" (238, 238, 0) is based on {{color sample|#FFFF00}} "Yellow" (255, 255, 0) with 255 × 0.932 = 237.66.
* {{color sample|#CDCDC1}} "Ivory 3" (205, 205, 193) is explained by {{color sample|#FFFFF0}} "Ivory" (255, 255, 240) where 255 × 0.804 = 205.02 and 240 × 0.804 = 192.96.
* {{color sample|#838B8B}} "Azure 4" (131, 139, 139) is close to {{color sample|#F0FFFF}} "Azure" (240, 255, 255) values transformed as 255 × 0.548 = 139.74 and 240 × 0.548 = 131.52.

=== Prefixed variants ===
Some color names appear to be brightness or saturation modifications of others because they bear prefixes such as ''Dark, Light, Medium, Pale'' or ''Deep'', but there is no systematic variation apparent. Several sets, however, feature a ''Dark'' variant with 55% brightness and some have their ''Medium'' at about 80%.

"Light Goldenrod Yellow" and "Dark Olive Green" are special, because there are no corresponding color entries without ''Dark'' and ''Light'' prefixes.

=== Tints and shades with different lightness ===
Several groups of colors share the same hue and HSL saturation. ''Tints'' are lighter than a base color, [[tints and shades|''shades'']] are darker.

=== Tones with different saturation ===
Some pairs of colors share the same lightness and hue. These ''tones'' differ only by saturation. Tones are far less common in the X11 set than nuances, tints and shades.

The Printer Working Group (PWG) of the [[IEEE]] publishes a standard, [http://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-pwgmsn20-20130328-5101.1.pdf PWG 5101.1], whose mandatory color names are based upon [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3805 RFC 3805], successor to [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1759 RFC 1759] which imported the functional color names ''other'', ''unknown'' and ''transparent'' alongside seven basic colors from [[ISO 10175]] ([[Document Printing Application|DPA]]) and [[ISO 10180]] ([[Standard Page Description Language|SPDL]]), and JTAPI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite
|editor = Free Standards Group (FSG) / OpenPrinting

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This standard has four variants for each non-monochromatic color: ''clear'' (50% transparent), ''dark'', ''light'' and the default. Wherever possible, the values are the same as in the W3C adaptation of the X11 list, except for Turquoise which is {{Color box|#30D5C8|border=darkgray}} instead of {{Color box|#40E0D0|border=darkgray}}. Missing variant values have been added systematically. ''Buff'' and ''Mustard'' are completely new color names. Light Black and Gray correspond to the same color.

'''Zarma''' (also spelled '''Djerma''', '''Dyabarma''', '''Dyarma''', '''Dyerma''', '''Adzerma''', '''Zabarma''', '''Zarbarma''', '''Zarma''', '''Zarmaci''' or '''Zerma''') is one of the [[Songhay languages]]. It is the leading indigenous language of the southwestern lobe of the [[West African]] nation of [[Niger]], where the [[Niger River]] flows and the capital city, [[Niamey]], is located. Zarma is the second-most common language in the country, after [[Hausa language|Hausa]], which is spoken in south-central Niger. With over 2 million speakers, Zarma is easily the most widely spoken Songhay language.

In earlier decades, Zarma was known as ''Djerma'', and it is still sometimes called ''Zerma'', especially among French-speakers, but it is usually now called Zarma, the name that its speakers use in their own language.

== Orthography ==
The Zarma alphabet uses the following letters: [[a]], [[b]], [[c]], [[d]], [[e]], [[f]], [[g]], [[h]], [[i]], [[j]], [[k]], [[l]], [[m]], [[n]], [[ɲ]] (or [[ny (digraph)|ny]]), [[ŋ]], [[o]], [[p]], [[r]], [[s]], [[t]], [[u]], [[w]], [[y]], [[z]]. Also, [[v]] may be used in a few words of foreign origin, but many Zarma cannot pronounce it.

Most of the letters are pronounced with the same values as the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)]], the exceptions being {{angle bracket|j}} {{IPAblink|ɟ}} (approximately English ''j'' but more palatalized), {{angle bracket|y}} {{IPAblink|j}}, {{angle bracket|r}} {{IPAblink|ɾ}} (a flap). The letter {{angle bracket|{{IPA link|c}}}} is approximately like English ''ch'' but more palatalized. The palatal nasal {{angle bracket|{{IPA link|ɲ}}}} is sometimes spelled {{angle bracket|ny}}.

Long consonants are written with double letters; {{angle bracket|rr}} is a trilled {{IPAblink|r}}. Long vowels are sometimes but inconsistently written with double letter. Nasal vowels are written with a tilde or a following {{angle bracket|n}} or {{angle bracket|ŋ}}. In older works, {{IPA|/c/}} was spelled {{angle bracket|ky}} or {{angle bracket|ty}}. Both {{angle bracket|n}} and {{angle bracket|m}} are pronounced as a labiodental nasal {{IPAblink|ɱ}} before {{angle bracket|f}}.

[[Tone (linguistics)|Tone]] is not written unless the word is ambiguous. Then, the standard IPA diacritics are used: ''bá'' ("to be a lot": high tone), ''bà'' ("to share": low tone), ''bâ'' ("to want" or "even": falling tone) and ''bǎ'' ("to be better": rising tone). However, the meaning is almost always unambiguous in the context so the words are usually all written ''ba''.

==Phonology==
=== Vowels ===

There are ten vowels: the five oral vowels ({{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}) and their [[nasal vowel|nasalized]] counterparts. There is slight variation, both allophonic and dialectal. [[Vowel length]] is phonemically distinctive. There are a number of combinations of a vowel with a semivowel {{IPA|/w/}} or {{IPA|/j/}},  the semivowel being initial or final.

The combinations {{IPA|/ɡe/, /ɡi/, /ke/}} and {{IPA|/ki/}} usually have some palatal quality to them and may even be interchangeable with {{IPA|/ɟe/, /ɟi/, /ce/}} and {{IPA|/ci/}} in the speech of many people.

All consonants may be short, and all consonants except /c/, /h/, /f/ and /z/ may be long. (In some dialects, long /f/ exists in the word ''goffo''.)

===Lexical tone and stress===
Zarma is a tonal language with four tones: high, low, fall and rise. In Dosso, some linguists (such as Tersis) have observed a dipping (falling-rising) tone for certain words: ''ma'' ("the name").

[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is generally unimportant in Zarma. According to Abdou Hamani (1980), two-syllable words are stressed on their first syllable unless that syllable is just a short vowel: a-, i- or u-. Three-syllable words have stress on their second syllable. The first consonant of a stressed syllable is pronounced a bit more strongly, and the vowel in the preceding syllable is weakened. Only emphasized words have a stressed syllable. There is no change of tone for a stressed syllable.

==Morphology==
=== General ===
There are many suffixes in Zarma. There are very few prefixes, and only one (''a-/i-'' before adjectives and numbers) is common.

====Nouns====
Nouns may be singular or plural. There are also three "forms" that indicate whether the noun is indefinite, definite or demonstrative. "Form" and number are indicated conjointly by an [[clitic|enclitic]] on the noun phrase. The singular definite enclitic is -ǒ or -ǎ. Some authors always write the ending with a rising tone mark even if it is not ambiguous and even if it is not truly a rising tone. The other endings are in the table below. The definite and the demonstrative endings replace any final vowel. See Hamani (1980) for a discussion on when to add -ǒ or -ǎ as well as other irregularities. See Tersis (1981) for a discussion of the complex changes in tone that may occur.

! Definite
! Demonstrative
|-
| Singular
| -∅
| -ǒ or -ǎ
| -ô
|-
| Plural
| -yáŋ

| -êy
|}

For example, ''súsúbày'' means "morning" (indefinite singular); ''súsúbǎ'' means "the morning" (definite singular); and ''súsúbô'' means "this morning" (demonstrative singular).

The indefinite plural -yáŋ ending is often used like English "some". ''Ay no leemuyaŋ'' means "Give me some oranges." Usually, the singular forms are used if the plurality is indicated by a number or other contextual clue, especially for the indefinite form: ''Soboro ga ba'' ("There are a lot of mosquitoes"); ''ay zanka hinkǎ'' ("my two children"); ''hasaraw hinko kulu ra'' ("in both of these catastrophes").

There is no gender or case in Zarma so the third-person singular pronoun ''a'' can mean "he", "she", "it", "her", "him", "his", "hers", "its", "one" or "one's", according to the context and its position in the sentence.

===Verbs===
Verbs do not have tenses and are not conjugated. There are at least three [[grammatical aspect|aspects]] for verbs that are indicated by a modal word before the verb and any object nouns. The aspects are the completive (''daahir gasu''), the incompletive (''daahir gasu si'') and the subjunctive (''afiri ŋwaaray nufa''). (Beginning grammars for foreigners sometimes inaccurately call the first two "past and present tenses".) There is also an imperative and a continuing or progressive construction. Lack of a modal marker indicates either the affirmative completive aspect (if there is a subject and no object) or the singular affirmative imperative (if there is no subject). There is a special modal marker, ''ka'' or ''ga'', according to the dialect, to indicate the completive aspect with emphasis on the subject. Different markers are used to indicate a negative sentence.

| mà || mà sí
|-
| Progressive
| go ga || si ga
|-
| Singular Imperative
|  ∅  ||  sí
|-
| Plural Imperative
| wà ||  wà sí
|}

Linguists do not agree on the tone for ''ga''. Some say that it is high before a low tone and low before a high tone.

There are several words in Zarma to translate the English "to be". The defective verb ''tí'' is used to equate two noun phrases, with the emphasized completive ''ka/ga'', as in ''Ay ma ka ti Yakuba'' ("My name is Yakuba"). The existential ''gǒ'' (negative ''sí'') is not a verb (White-Kaba, 1994, calls it a "verboid") and has no aspect; it means "exist" and usually links a noun phrase to a descriptive term, such as a place, a price or a participle: ''A go fuwo ra'' ("She's in the house"). The predicative ''nô'' means "it is", "they are", etc. and is one of the most common words in Zarma. It has no aspect or negative form and is placed after a noun phrase, sometimes for emphasis: ''Ni do no ay ga koy'' ("It's to your house I'm going"). Other words, such as ''gòró'', ''cíyà'', ''tíyà'' and ''bárà'' are much rarer and usually express ideas, such as the subjunctive, which ''gǒ'' and ''tí'' cannot handle.

Participles can be formed with the suffix ''-ànté'', which is similar in meaning to the past participle in English. It can also be added to quantities to form ordinal numbers and to some nouns to form adjectives. A sort of gerund can be formed by adding ''-yàŋ'', which transforms the verb into a noun. There are many other suffixes that can make nouns out of verbs, but only ''-yàŋ'' works with all verbs.

Two verbs can be related with the word ''ká''. (In many dialects it is ''gá'', not to be confused with the incompletive aspect marker or the emphasized completive marker.) The connector ''ká'' implies that the second verb is a result of the first or that the first is the reason or cause of the second: ''ka ga ŋwa'', "come (in order to) eat." A large number of idiomatic expressions are expressed with it: ''sintin ga ...'' or ''sintin ka'' means "to begin to ...", ''ban ga ...'' means "to have already ...", ''ba ga ...'' means "to be about to ..., ''gay ga ...'' means "it's been awhile since ...", ''haw ga ...'' means "to purposely ..." and so on.

==Syntax==
Zarma's normal word order is [[subject–object–verb]]. The object is normally placed before the verb but may be placed after the verb for emphasis, and a few common verbs require the object after them. Unlike English, which places prepositions before a noun, Zarma has [[postpositions]], which are placed after the noun: ''fuwo ra'' (in the house), ''fuwo jine'' (in front of the house).

When two nouns are placed together, the first noun modifies the second, showing possession, purpose or description: ''Fati tirǎ'' (Fati's book), ''haŋyaŋ hari'' (drinking water), ''fu meeyo'' (the door of a house). The same construction occurs with a pronoun before a noun: ''ni baaba'' ("your father"). All other modifiers of a noun (adjectives, articles, numbers, demonstratives etc.) are placed after the noun: ''Ay baaba wura muusu boŋey'' ("My father’s gold lion heads", Tersis, 1981).

Here is a proverb in Zarma:

''Da curo fo hẽ, afo mana hẽ, i si jinde kaana bay.''

:{| style="width:95%; height:75px"
|''da'' ||''curo'' ||''fo'' ||''hẽ,'' ||''a-fo'' ||''mana'' ||''hẽ,'' ||''i'' ||''si'' ||''jinde''||''kaan-a'' ||''bay''
|-
|if ||bird ||one ||cry, ||{{smallcaps|noun-forming&lt;br&gt;prefix}}-one ||{{smallcaps|negative.com-&lt;br&gt;pletive_aspect}} ||cry, ||they ||{{smallcaps|negative.incom-&lt;br&gt;pletive_aspect}} ||voice ||good-{{smallcaps|definite}} ||know
|-
|colspan=12|‘If one bird sings, and another doesn't sing, they won't know which voice is sweetest".
|}

That means that "you need to hear both sides of the story".

'''Åland Swedish''' ({{lang-sv|åländska}}) is a [[dialect]] of Swedish spoken in the [[Åland Islands]], an autonomous province of Finland. Åland Swedish has similarities to both [[Finland Swedish]] and the historical dialects of [[Uppland]], but it is generally considered to be a variant of [[Swedish dialects|Eastern Swedish]] (''östsvenska mål'', varieties of Swedish spoken in Finland and [[Estonian Swedes#Language|Estonia]]).

Swedish is the sole official [[Languages of Åland|language of Åland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/sv/laki/ajantasa/1991/19911144 Självstyrelselag för Åland 16.8.1991/1144 - 36 §]. Retrieved 10 Apr. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and its status is protected in the ''självstyrelselag'', a law that guarantees the islands' [[autonomy]] within Finland.

==Phonology==

As in Finland Swedish, the [[pitch accent|tonal word accent]] that distinguishes certain minimal pairs is not present in Åland Swedish. Of the two accents—the [[acute accent]] (accent 1) and the [[grave accent]] (accent 2) — only the acute exists in Åland Swedish.&lt;ref name=stadsbibliotek&gt;[http://www.bibliotek.ax/WebRoot/1027359/SubPage.aspx?id=1040244 Åländska ord och uttryck]. ''Bibliotek.ax''. Retrieved 10 Apr. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus {{IPA-sv|ˈandɛn|}} (the duck) and {{IPA|[ˈanˈdɛn]}} (the spirit) are both pronounced {{IPA|[ˈandɛn]}}.

==Characteristics==

Certain expressions are typical of Åland Swedish. For example, the double genitive in ''Vemses flicka/pojke är du då?'' ("''Whose's'' girl/boy are you?" (''Vems flicka/pojke är du då'' in Standard Swedish)) carries the implication that the asker might know the parents of the person asked, likely in a small society such as Åland. Another characteristic is the substitution of ''inte'' (not) with ''inga'' (no, nobody, none; in Standard Swedish a plural form): ''Jag har inga varit där'' ("I have not been there").

A feature that Åland Swedish shares with Finland Swedish is the reduction of the words ''inte'' (not), ''skulle'' (should) and ''måste'' (must) to ''int'', ''sku'' and ''måst'' respectively.&lt;ref name=stadsbibliotek /&gt;

==Vocabulary==

The dialectal vocabulary of Åland Swedish is composed of words that are either characteristic of Eastern Swedish or have passed out of use (but are still understood) in the Swedish spoken in Sweden. Traces of Finnish, Russian and English can also be found in the dialect because of historical contact.&lt;ref name=stadsbibliotek /&gt;
