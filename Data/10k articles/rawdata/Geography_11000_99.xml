[[File:A229sandling.jpg|thumb|260px|A229 approaching [[Maidstone]] at [[Sandling, Maidstone|Sandling]], [[Kent]]]]

The '''A229''' is a major [[road]] running north-south through [[Kent]] from [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] to [[Hawkhurst]] via [[Maidstone]]. It is a former [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman road]] that ran from Rochester to [[Hastings]].

The road is well-known for Blue Bell Hill, which connects Rochester to Maidstone through the [[North Downs]], and links the [[M2 motorway (Great Britain)|M2]] and [[M20 motorway]]s. A popular [[ghost story]] documents a driver picking up a [[vanishing hitchhiker|phantom female hitch-hiker]] on the A229 outside the [[Lower Bell]] pub, who subsequently disappears inside the driver's car.

==Route==
The A229 is about {{convert|30|miles|km}} long. The road passes through little in the way of built-up areas aside from the Medway Towns and Maidstone. It is principally a link between these two areas and the south coast around Hastings.

The road begins in the [[Medway]] town of [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] at the foot of Star Hill forming a junction with the [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]]. It then climbs up through the built-up area of Chatham, passing Troy Town and [[Rochester Airport, England|Rochester Airport]] and the [[M2 motorway (Great Britain)|M2 motorway]] before descending the slope of the [[North Downs]] at [[Blue Bell Hill]]. Below the road as it descends is the tunnel carrying [[High Speed 1]]. Once into the [[Medway Valley]], there is a junction with the [[M20 motorway]], and it follows the River Medway into Maidstone town centre. There are junctions with several main roads here, including the [[A26 road|A26]] and [[A249 road|A249]].

Beyond Maidstone, the road climbs up [[Greensand Ridge]] to [[Loose, Kent|Loose]], built on the ridge's southern slope, before running through the valley of the River Beult to [[Staplehurst]]. Beyond this, it follows the [[Weald]] through [[Cranbrook, Kent|Cranbrook]] and climbs another hill to [[Hawkhurst]]. The road ends on the [[A21 road (England)|A21]] London – Hastings Road near Hurst Green.

===Traffic===
The A229 through Maidstone is a major bottleneck on the route, with long daily morning and evening queues entering both sides of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kentonline/newsarchive.aspx?articleid=22091|title=Plan unveiled to end bridge traffic misery|publisher=Kent Online|date=26 August 2005|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Checkpoints===
In 2006, the road was set up with the then largest vehicle checkpoint campaign in Kent, in order to catch drug dealers and benefit fraudsters. Twenty-seven vehicles were apprehended, but there were no arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/5390300.stm|title=BBC NEWS – England – Kent – Criminals targeted in road check|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The road largely follows the route of [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman Road]] No.&amp;nbsp;13, as described by [[Ivan Margary]], which ran from Rochester to [[Hastings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Secret History of the Roman Roads of Britain: And their Impact on Military History|first=M.C.|last=Bishop|publisher=Pen and Sword|year=2014|p=140|isbn=978-1-848-84615-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[turnpike road|turnpiked]] between Rochester and Maidstone in 1728, then to Cranbrook in 1760.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Economy of Kent, 1640–1914|editor=Alan Armstrong|p=133|publisher=Boydell Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-851-15582-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The A229 number was assigned in 1923, following the turnpike road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=List of Class I and Class II Roads and Numbers|publisher=HMSO|year=1923|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original route through Maidstone ran along Sandling Road and Week Street; the diversion along the riverside opened in 1978. It runs partially on the site of [[Fremlin's Brewery]], whose production site in Maidstone had then recently closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hales|first=Irene|year=2013|title=Old Maidstone's Public Houses from Old Photographs|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|p=29|isbn=978-1-445-62982-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The southern extent of the road from Hawkhurst to [[Sedlescombe]] was downgraded to a B-road in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Ghost stories==
[[File:Lower Bell, near Blue Bell Hill - geograph.org.uk - 1626676.jpg|thumb|The [[Lower Bell]] pub at Blue Bell Hill on the pre-bypass A229; where the phantom hitch-hiker has been reported]]
On 19 November 1965, three women were severely injured in a road accident at Blue Bell Hill on the A229 when their [[Ford Cortina]] collided with a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]]. One of the women, 22-year old Susan Browne from [[Gillingham, Kent|Gillingham]], who was due to wed [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] technician Brian Wetton, died five days later at [[West Kent Hospital]] in [[Maidstone]]; the two other females, Judith Lingham and Patricia Ferguson, died soon after the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/maidstone/news/the-truth-about-the-ghost-46573/|title=VIDEO: The truth about the ghost of Blue Bell Hill|publisher=Kent Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/southerncounties/content/articles/2005/08/15/strange_south_a229_feature.shtml|title=Britain's Most Haunted Road?|work=BBC Southern Counties}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, there have been several reports of ghosts relating to the accident. The basic story is that a driver passing the [[Lower Bell]] pub on the A229 spots a lone female dressed in white at the side of the road. He offers her a lift, and she gives him an address. Some time later, the driver looks in the rear view mirror to discover she has disappeared. Other variations of the story report a small purse or handbag left behind, or that when the driver reaches the intended address, he is informed by a family member there that his passenger died several years previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kent Urban Legends|first=Neil|last=Arnold|publisher=The History Press|p=30-31|year=2013|isbn=978-0-752-48146-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend has now become one of the best-known ghost stories involving [[vanishing hitchhiker|phantom hitch-hiking]] in the United Kingdom, and the Blue Bell Hill Road is reported to be one of the most haunted roads in the country.&lt;ref name=haughton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kentlive.news/the-most-haunted-places-in-kent/story-29742327-detail/story.html|title=These are the 24 most haunted places in Kent|publisher=Kent Live|date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 July 1974, local bricklayer Maurice Goodenough ran into Rochester Police Station and reported he had run over a girl aged around 10 on Blue Bell Hill, who suffered several cuts, and had left her at the roadside wrapped in a blanket. When the police returned to the scene, the girl had disappeared, and despite an extensive {{convert|10|miles|km|adj=on}} radius search of the area, the girl was never found. A further incident of the lone female variant of the story was reported in 1992. Other variations are drivers reporting to have driven straight through a girl in the middle of the road, without any apparent injury.&lt;ref name=haughton&gt;{{cite book|title=Famous Ghost Stories: Legends and Lore|first=Brian|last=Haughton|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|pp=93–95|year=2011|isbn=978-1-448-84840-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a local group wrote and directed the short film, ''The Ghost of Blue Bell Hill'', which covers the numerous ghost stories relating to the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/maidstone/news/blue-bell-hill-ghost-film-25048/|title=The crew of The Ghost of Blue Bell Hill film felt a 'terrible feeling' while shooting the two-hour movie at the spot where ghosts have been seen|work=Kent Online|date=10 October 2014|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aleutian Current''' is also called the "Subarctic Current". An eastward flowing ocean current which lies north of the [[North Pacific Current]]; it is the northern branch of the [[Kuroshio Current]] which moves northeast then east between 40° N and 50° N. As it approaches the coast of North America it divides to form the northward-flowing [[Alaska Current]] and the southward-flowing [[California Current]] .

Historically, this included cities such as [[Rome]], [[Athens]], [[Carthage]],&lt;ref name="freed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/city-state|title=city-state|work=thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=1 February 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170120213732/http://www.thefreedictionary.com/city-state|archivedate=20 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Italian city-states]] during the [[Renaissance]]. As of 2018, only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies currently to [[Singapore]], [[Monaco]], and [[Vatican City]]. City states are also sometimes called [[micro-state]]s which however also includes other configurations of very small countries.

A number of other small states share similar characteristics, and therefore are sometimes also cited as modern city-states—namely, [[Qatar]],&lt;ref name="Parker, Geoffrey 2005.

== Historical background ==

=== Ancient and medieval world ===
{{further|List of ancient Greek cities|List of Phoenician cities|Cities of the ancient Near East|Italian city-states|Maya city|Polis|Altepetl}}

Historical city-states included [[Sumer]]ian cities such as [[Uruk]] and [[Ur]]; [[Ancient Egypt]]ian city-states, such as [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]; the [[Phoenicia]]n cities (such as [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]]); the five [[Philistines|Philistine]] city-states; the [[Berber people|Berber]] city-states of the [[Garamantes]]; the city-states of [[ancient Greece]] (the [[poleis]] such as [[Classical Athens|Athens]], [[Sparta]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]); the [[Roman Republic]] (which grew from a city-state into a [[Historical powers|great power]]); the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] and other cultures of pre-Columbian [[Mesoamerica]] (including cities such as [[Chichen Itza]], [[Tikal]], [[Copán]] and [[Monte Albán]]); the [[central Asia]]n cities along the [[Silk Road]]; the city-states of the [[Swahili coast]]; [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]; [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]]; states of the medieval Russian lands such as [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] and [[Pskov]]; and many others. Danish historian Poul Holm has classed the [[Vikings|Viking]] colonial cities in medieval [[Ireland]], most importantly [[Dublin]], as city-states.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Poul, "Viking Dublin and the City-State Concept: Parameters and Significance of the Hiberno-Norse Settlement" (Respondent: Donnchadh Ó Corráin), in [[Mogens Herman Hansen]] (ed.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8qvY8pxVxcwC A Comparative Study of Thirty City-State Cultures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621023251/http://books.google.com/books?id=8qvY8pxVxcwC |date=21 June 2013 }}''.

[[File:Dubrovnik crop.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Republic of Ragusa]], a maritime city-state, was based in the [[Walls of Dubrovnik|walled city]] of [[Dubrovnik]]]]

In [[Cyprus]], the [[Phoenicia]]n settlement of [[Kition]] (in present-day Larnaca) was a city-state that existed from around 800 BC until the end of the 4th century BC.

Some of the most well-known examples of city-state culture in human history are the ancient Greek city-states and the merchant city-states of [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]], which organised themselves as small independent centers. The success of small regional units coexisting as [[autonomy|autonomous]] actors in loose geographical and cultural unity, as in [[Italy]] and [[Greece]], often prevented their [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamation]] into larger national units.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} However, such small political entities often survived only for short periods because they lacked the resources to defend themselves against incursions by larger states. Thus they inevitably gave way to larger organisations of society, including the [[empire]] and the [[nation-state]].&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo, "Ideal of Human Unity" included in ''Social and Political Thought'', 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=August 2015}}

===Southeast Asia===

In the history of [[mainland Southeast Asia]], aristocratic groups, Buddhist leaders, and others organized settlements into autonomous or semi-autonomous city-states. These were referred to{{by whom|date=October 2017}} as ''[[mueang]]'', and were usually related in a tributary relationship now described{{by whom|date=October 2017}} as [[Mandala (political model)|mandala]] or as ''over-lapping sovereignty'', in which smaller city-states paid tribute to larger ones that paid tribute to still larger ones—until reaching the apex in cities like [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]], [[Bagan]], [[Bangkok]] and others that served as centers of Southeast Asian royalty. The system existed until the 19th century, when [[colonization]] by European powers occurred. [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]], a regional power at the time, needed to define their territories for negotiation with the European powers so the Siamese  government established a [[nation-state]] system, incorporated their tributary cities ([[Lan Xang]], [[Dark Ages of Cambodia|Cambodia]] and some Malay cities) into their territory and abolished the mueang and the tributary system.&lt;ref&gt;

===Central Europe===
[[File:Free Imperial Cities 1792.png|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]] in the 18th century]]
In the [[Holy Roman Empire]] the [[Free imperial city|Free Imperial Cities]] enjoyed considerable autonomy, buttressed legally by [[international law]] following the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648). Some, like the three [[Hanseatic cities]] of Bremen, Hamburg and Lübeck, pooled their economic relations with foreign powers and were able to wield considerable diplomatic clout. The cities often made protective alliances with other cities or neighbour regions, including the [[Hanseatic League]], the [[Swabian League of Cities]], the [[Décapole]], or the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]]. The [[Cantons of Switzerland|Swiss Cantons]] of [[Canton of Zürich|Zürich]], [[Canton of Bern|Bern]], [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]], [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]], [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]], [[Canton of Basel|Basel]], [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]], and [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]] originated as city-states.

After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, cities{{spaced ndash}}then members of different [[confederation|confederacies]]{{spaced ndash}}officially became sovereign city-states {{spaced ndash}}such as the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] (1806–11 and again 1813–71), the [[Free City of Frankfurt|Free City of Frankfurt upon Main]] (1815–66), the [[Hamburg|Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg]] (1806–11 and again 1814–71), the [[Free City of Lübeck|Free and Hanseatic City of Lübeck]] (1806–11 and again 1813–71), and the [[Free City of Kraków]] (1815–1846). Under [[Habsburg]] rule the city of [[Fiume]] had the status of a [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)|corpus separatum]], which – while falling short of an independent sovereignty – had many attributes of a city state.

A later city-state, though lacking sovereignty, was [[West Berlin]] (1948–1990), being a state legally not belonging to any other state, but ruled by the [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]]. They allowed{{spaced ndash}}notwithstanding their overlordship as occupant powers{{spaced ndash}}its internal organisation as one state simultaneously being a city, officially called Berlin (West). Though West Berlin maintained close ties to the West German [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], it was legally never part of it.

====Danzig====
{{Main|Free City of Danzig}}
The Free City of Danzig was a semi-[[autonomous]] city-state that existed between 1920 and 1939, consisting of the [[Baltic Sea]] port of Danzig (now [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]]) and nearly 200 towns in the surrounding areas. It was created on 15 November 1920&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Danzig&amp;nbsp;– Biographie einer Stadt| url = https://books.google.com/?id=9ifeo6zdSMcC| date = February 2011| publisher = C.H.

====Fiume====
{{Main|Free State of Fiume}}
After a prolonged period where the city of [[Fiume]] enjoyed considerable autonomy under [[Habsburg]] rule (see [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)]], The Free State of Fiume was proclaimed as a fully independent free state which existed between 1920 and 1924. Its territory of 28&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (11 sq mi) comprised the city of Fiume (now in [[Croatia]] and, since the end of World War II, known as [[Rijeka]]) and rural areas to its north, with a corridor to its west connecting it to [[Italy]].

====Shanghai====
{{Main|Shanghai International Settlement}}
The Shanghai International Settlement (1845–1943) was an international zone with its own legal system, postal service, and currency.

====Tangier====
{{Main|Tangier International Zone}}
[[File:Tangier 12.JPG|thumb|Tangier]]
The international zone within the city of [[Tangier]], in North Africa was approximately 373&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (144 sq mi). It was at first under the joint administration of France, Spain, and the United Kingdom, plus later Portugal, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States. The international zone was initially attached to Morocco. It then became a French-Spanish protectorate from 1923 until the  29 of October 1956 when it was reintegrated into the state of Morocco.

====Memel====
{{Main|Klaipėda Region}}
The Klaipėda Region or Memel Territory was defined by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1920 when it was put under the administration of the [[Council of Ambassadors]]. The Memel Territory was to remain under the control of the [[League of Nations]] until a future day when the people of the region would be allowed to vote on whether the land would return to Germany or not. The then predominantly [[ethnic German]] Memel Territory ([[Prussian Lithuanians]] and Memellanders constituted the other ethnic groups), situated between the river and the town of that name, was occupied by [[Lithuania]] in the [[Klaipėda Revolt]] of 1923.

====Trieste====
{{Main|Free Territory of Trieste}}
The Free Territory of Trieste was an independent territory situated in Central Europe between northern Italy and Yugoslavia, facing the north part of the Adriatic Sea, under direct responsibility of the [[United Nations Security Council]] in the aftermath of World War II, from 1947 to 1954. The UN attempted to make the Free Territory of Trieste into a city state, but it never gained real independence and in 1954 its territory was divided between [[Italy]] and [[Yugoslavia]].

====Jerusalem====
{{Main|Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)}}
Under the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] of 1947, [[Mandatory Palestine]] was to be partitioned into three states: a Jewish state of [[Israel]], an Arab state of [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], and a ''corpus separatum'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "[[Corpus separatum (disambiguation)|separated body]]") consisting of a Jerusalem city-state under the control of [[United Nations Trusteeship Council]]. Although the plan had some international support and the UN accepted this proposal (and still officially holds the stance that Jerusalem should be held under this regime), implementation of the plan failed as the [[1948 Palestine war]] broke out with the [[1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]], ultimately resulting in Jerusalem being split into [[West Jerusalem]] and [[East Jerusalem]]. Israel would eventually gain control of East Jerusalem in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967.

===Monaco===
{{Main|Monaco}}

The [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]] is an independent city-state. [[Monaco-Ville]] (the ancient fortified city) and Monaco's well-known area [[Monte Carlo]] are districts of a continuous urban zone, not distinct cities, though they were three separate municipalities (''communes'') until 1917. The Principality of Monaco and the city of Monaco (each having specific powers) govern the same territory. Though they maintain a small [[Military of Monaco|military]] they would still have to rely on France, for defence in the face of an aggressive world power.

===Singapore===
{{Main|Singapore}}
Singapore is an island city-state in [[Southeast Asia]]. About 5.2 million people live and work within {{convert|700|km2}}, making Singapore the [[List of countries by population density|2nd-most-densely populated country in the world]] after Monaco, another city-state. Singapore was part of [[Malaysia]] before it was [[Singapore in Malaysia#Expulsion|expelled from the federation]] in 1965, becoming an independent [[republic]], a city and a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] country. ''[[The Economist]]'' refers to the nation as the "world's only fully functioning city-state". In particular, it has its own [[Singapore dollar|currency]] and a full [[Singapore Armed Forces|armed forces]] for deterrence to safeguard the nation's sovereignty against potential aggressors.&lt;ref name="econ-CS"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21657606-continue-flourish-its-second-half-century-south-east-asias-miracle-city-state |title=The Singapore exception |date=18 July 2015 |work=The Economist |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731005515/http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21657606-continue-flourish-its-second-half-century-south-east-asias-miracle-city-state |archivedate=31 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vatican City===
[[File:Vatican City map EN.png|thumb|left|[[Vatican City]], a city-state well known for being the smallest country in the world]]
{{Main|Vatican City}}
Until September 1870, the city of [[Rome]] had been controlled by the [[pope]] as part of his [[Papal States]]. When King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]] seized the city in 1870, [[Pope Pius IX]] refused to recognize the newly formed [[Italian unification|Kingdom of Italy]].

Because he could not travel without effectively acknowledging the authority of the king, Pius IX and his successors each claimed to be a "[[Prisoner in the Vatican]]", unable to leave the {{convert|0.44|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} papal [[enclave]] once they had ascended the [[throne|papal thrones]].

The [[Roman Question|impasse]] was resolved in 1929 by the [[Lateran Treaties]] negotiated by the Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] between King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] and [[Pope Pius XI]]. Under this treaty, the Vatican was recognized as an independent state, with the Pope as its head. The [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]] has its own [[citizenship]], [[diplomatic corps]], [[Flag of the Vatican City|flag]], and [[postage stamp]]s. With a population of less than 1,000 (mostly clergymen), it is by far the smallest sovereign country in the world.

== Non-sovereign city-states ==
[[File:Map of Hong Kong 18 Districts en.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Hong Kong]], the world's most populous city-state]]
Some cities or urban areas, while not sovereign states, may nevertheless enjoy such a high degree of autonomy that they function as "city-states" within the context of the sovereign state to which they belong. Historian [[Mogens Herman Hansen]] describes this aspect of self-government as: "The city-state is a self-governing, but not necessarily independent political unit."&lt;ref name="Mogens, Hansen 2000.

**The [[City of London]] has historically been a semi-sovereign city-state within the [[Kingdom of England]]. Today, it has a unique political status within the [[United Kingdom]]. It is a [[counties of England|county]] of its own, and not one of the thirty-two [[London boroughs]], although it is one of the thirty-three [[districts of England|administrative districts]] of [[Greater London]]. The City has its own local government -- the [[City of London Corporation]] -- which shares administrative power over the City with the [[Greater London Authority]], the elected government of [[Greater London]].
*[[Malaysia]]: [[Labuan]] and [[Putrajaya]]
*[[United Arab Emirates]]: [[Dubai]], [[Sharjah]]
**The [[Emirates of the United Arab Emirates|seven emirates]] are themselves city-states, or were historically.
*[[Germany]]: two [[States of Germany|German federal states]] are "[[Free Imperial City|Free]] and [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] Cities": [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], the latter of which consists of the [[Bremen|city of Bremen]] and an [[exclave]] at the [[seaport]] of [[Bremerhaven]].
&lt;!--- DO NOT ADD WASHINGTON, D.C. TO THIS LIST:
Non-sovereign city-states have a high degree of autonomy. Article One, Section Eight of the United States Constitution grants the United States Congress "exclusive jurisdiction" over the city. The 1973 Home Rule Act devolved certain Congressional powers to an elected mayor and the thirteen-member Council of the District of Columbia. However, Congress remains free to enact any legislation for the District so long as constitutionally permissible, to review and overturn any legislation by the city government, and technically to revoke the city government at any time. Congress regularly intervenes in local affairs, e.g. the budget is set by the mayor but must be approved by Congress.

=== ''Stadtstaaten'' of Germany ===
Two cities in Germany, namely [[Berlin]] and [[Hamburg]], are considered city-states ([[German language|German]]: ''Stadtstaaten''). Additionally, the state of [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]] is often called a city-state although it consists of the two cities of [[Bremen]] and [[Bremerhaven]], which are separated by the state of [[Lower Saxony]]. Together with thirteen area states ([[German language|German]]: ''Flächenländer'') they form the sixteen federal [[states of Germany]].&lt;ref name="Mogens, Hansen 2000. Pg. 19" /&gt;

Generally, the city-states have no other rights or duties than the other states. Through the financial redistribution system of [[Equalization Payments in Germany]] (German: ''Länderfinanzausgleich''), they do receive more money because of their demographic characteristics. The city-states are most distinctive due to the names of their state organs: their governments are called Senate, the prime ministers 'mayor' (Governing Mayor in [[Berlin]] and First Mayor in Hamburg) or President of the Senate (in Bremen) and also the expressions for their state parliaments differ from the other states.

In the 18th century many German cities were [[free imperial cities]] (German: ''Reichsstädte''), without a principality [[Imperial immediacy|between them and the imperial level]]. After the Napoleonic era, in 1815, four were still city-states: Hamburg, Bremen and Lübeck in Northern Germany, and Frankfurt where the [[Federal Convention (German Confederation)|Federal Convention]] was located. Frankfurt was incorporated by Prussia in 1866, and Lübeck became a part of Prussia during the national socialist regime in 1937 (Greater Hamburg Law). After 1945, Berlin was a divided city, and the Western part became a German quasi-state under (Western) Allied supervision. Since 1990/1991, the reunited Berlin is an ordinary German state among others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1810">'''Clanius''' (also '''Glanis''' or '''Clanis'''; {{lang-grc|Γλάνις}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius Periegetes]], ''Orbis Terrae Descriptio''&lt;/ref&gt;) is a river of [[Campania]] noted in antiquity. It rises in the [[Apennines]] near [[Avella|Abella]], and traverses the whole plain of Campania, falling into the sea about {{convert|4|miles}} south of the [[Volturno|Vulturnus]] (modern ''Volturno''). In the early part of its course it flowed by the town of [[Acerrae (Campania)|Acerrae]], which frequently suffered severely from the ravages of its waters during floods.&lt;ref&gt;''vacuis Clanius non aequus Acerris'', [[Virgil]] ''G.'' 2.225; [[Silius Italicus|Sil. Ital.]] 8.537.&lt;/ref&gt; At other times their stagnation rendered the country unhealthy; hence in the nineteenth century the stream was diverted into a canal or artificial course, called ''il regio Lagno'', and sometimes by corruption ''l'Agno''. This is divided into two streams near its mouth, the one of which flows direct into the sea, and is known as ''Foce dei Lagni'', the other takes a more southerly direction, and joins, or rather forms, a marshy lake called the ''Lago di Patria'' (the ancient [[Literna Palus]]), the outlet of which into the sea, about {{convert|7|miles}} miles south of the former branch, called the F''oce di Patria''. This is evidently the same which was known in ancient times as the river ''Liternus ternus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Livy|32.29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite Strabo|v. p.243}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appears to have been then the principal, if not the only outlet of the Clanius, as [[Strabo]], who describes the coast of Campania minutely, does not notice the latter river.

=== Seasonal climate ===
[[File:Puente de las flores.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Winter in Valencia: very mild temperatures and mostly green flora.]]

==== Winter ====
Winters in Valencia are very mild. December, January and February are the coldest months, with average temperatures around {{convert|17|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|8|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night. From a few to a dozen days in the winter, the temperature exceeds {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Because of the very mild temperatures in winter, most of the vegetation remains green throughout the year.

March is a transitional month, the temperature often exceeding {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}}, with average temperature of around {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|10|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night.&lt;ref name="AEMET" /&gt;

==== Summer ====
Summers in Valencia area are long and warm to hot (in the middle of summer). Generally the summer season lasts about eight months, from April to November. Regular temperatures above {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}} begin as early as April, although in this month the sea temperature is still cool: about {{convert|15|-|16|C|F}}. The summer season ends in November, in this month sometimes occurring days with temperatures below {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. The sea temperature in November remains mild - about {{convert|18|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

July and August are the warmest months, with average temperatures around {{convert|29|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|22|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night.

== Sunshine ==
[[Sunshine duration]] is 2,660 hours per year, from 150 - average about 5 hours of sunshine a day in December to 314 - average above 10 hours of sunshine a day in July.&lt;ref name="AEMET"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=8416&amp;k=val |title=Standard Climate Values. Valencia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a bit above average for the southern half of Europe because in this part of the continent, sunshine duration varies from about 2,000 to about 3,000 hours per year. However, this is a 70% larger value than in the northern half of Europe, where sunshine duration is around 1500 hours per year.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In winter Valencia has about three times more sun duration than in the northern half of Europe.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

== Curio ==
Valencia has a similar [[latitude]] to [[Madrid]]. However, the climate of these Spanish cities is very different, as Valencia is located at the seaside; Madrid is located in the approximate middle of the inland plateau. Valencia has much warmer winters (data from January, the coldest month): 
*Valencia: {{convert|16.4|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|7.1|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night 
*Madrid: {{convert|10|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|2|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=3195&amp;k=mad Standard Climate Values. Madrid] - Agencia Estatal de Meteorología&lt;/ref&gt;
and also Valencia has longer summers and milder temperatures in the middle of summer during the day.

The [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] in Europe constitutes the second largest Christian denomination. European Eastern Orthodox Christians are predominantly present in Eastern and Southeastern Europe, and they are also significantly represented in diaspora throughout the Continent. The term Eastern Orthodox Europe is informally used to describe the predominantly Eastern Orthodox countries of [[Eastern Europe]] as well as [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]] and one [[Caucasus]] state - [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. These include [[Belarus]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Moldova]], [[Montenegro]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], and [[Ukraine]].

==History==
Almost all of Eastern Orthodox Europe became part of [[communist state]]s after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="CunninghamTheokritoff2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary B.

[[Poland]] is a country in [[Central Europe]] with an area of 312,679 square kilometres (120,726 sq. mi.), and mostly temperate climate.&lt;ref name="Yearbook"&gt;[http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/PUBL_maly_rocznik_statystyczny_2008.pdf  Concise Statistical Yearbook of Poland, 2008.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028221046/http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/PUBL_maly_rocznik_statystyczny_2008.pdf |date=October 28, 2008 }} ''Central Statistical Office (Poland)''. 28 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, Poland is an almost unbroken plain reaching from the [[Baltic Sea]] in the north, to the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the south. Within that plain, terrain variations run in bands east to west. 
The Baltic coast has two natural [[harbor]]s, the larger one in the [[Tricity, Poland|Gdańsk-Gdynia]] region, and a smaller one near [[Szczecin]] in the far northwest. The northeastern region, also known as the [[Masurian Lake District]] with more than 2,000 lakes,&lt;ref name="mazury.info"&gt;[http://mazury.info.pl/ Masurian Lake District, at mazury.info.pl] &amp;nbsp;{{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; is densely wooded and sparsely populated. To the south of the lake district, and across central Poland a vast region of plains extends all the way to the [[Sudeten mountains|Sudetes]] on the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] and [[Slovakia|Slovak]] borders southwest, and to the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] on the Czech, Slovak and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] borders southeast. The central lowlands had been formed by [[Glacier#Glacial erosion|glacial erosion]] in the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]]. The neighboring countries are Germany to the west, the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south, Ukraine and [[Belarus]] to the east, and [[Lithuania]] and the [[Russia]]n exclave of [[Kaliningrad]] to the northeast.

==Topography==
The country extends 876 kilometers from north to south and 689 kilometers from east to west, at an area of 312,679 square kilometers including inland waters. The average [[elevation]] is 173 meters, and only 3% of Polish territory, along the southern border, is higher than 500 meters. The highest elevation is [[Rysy|Mount Rysy]], which rises 2,499 meters in the [[Tatra Mountains|Tatra]] Range of the Carpathian Mountains, 95 kilometers south of [[Kraków]]. About 63 square kilometers along the [[Gulf of Gdańsk]] are below sea level.

===Topographic regions===
Poland is traditionally divided into five [[topography|topographic]] zones from north to south.

The largest, the central lowlands or "Polish Plain" ({{lang-pl|Niż Polski}} or ''Nizina Polska''), is narrow in the west, then expands to the north and south as it extends eastward. Along the eastern border, this zone reaches from the far northeast to within 200 kilometers of the southern border. The terrain in the central lowlands is quite flat, and earlier [[Glacier#Glacial erosion|glacial lakes]] have been filled by sediment. The region is cut by several major rivers, including the [[Oder River|Oder]] (Odra), which defines the [[Silesian Lowlands]] in the southwest, and the [[Vistula River|Vistula]] (Wisla), which defines the lowland areas of east-central Poland.

To the south of the lowlands are the lesser Poland uplands, a belt varying in width from 90 to 200 kilometers, formed by the gently sloping foothills of the Sudeten and Carpathian mountain ranges and the uplands that connect the ranges in southcentral Poland. The topography of this region is divided transversely into higher and lower elevations, reflecting its underlying [[geology|geological]] structure. In the western section, the Silesia-Kraków Upthrust contains rich [[coal]] deposits.
{{further|List of mountains in Poland}}

The third topographic area is located on either side of Poland's southern border and is formed by the Sudeten and Carpathian ranges. Within Poland, neither of these ranges is forbidding enough to prevent substantial habitation; the Carpathians are especially densely populated. The rugged form of the Sudeten range derives from the geological shifts that formed the later Carpathian uplift. The highest elevation in the Sudeten is [[Śnieżka]] (1,602 meters) in the [[Karkonosze Mountains]]. The Carpathians in Poland, formed as a discrete topographical unit in the relatively recent [[Tertiary|Tertiary Era]], are the highest mountains in the country. They are the northernmost edge of a much larger range that extends into the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine, [[Hungary]], and [[Romania]]. Within Poland the range includes two major basins, the [[Oświęcim]] and [[Sandomierz]], which are rich in several minerals and [[natural gas]].

To the north of the central lowlands, the lake region includes [[Białowieża Forest|primeval forests]] - one of the last  remaining in Europe and much of Poland's shrinking unspoiled natural habitat. Glacial action in this region formed lakes and low hills in the otherwise flat terrain adjacent to Lithuania and the Baltic Sea. Small lakes dot the entire northern half of Poland, and the glacial formations that characterize the lake region extend as much as 200 kilometers inland in western Poland. Wide river valleys divide the lake region into three parts. In the northwest, [[Pomerania]] is located south of the Baltic coastal region and north of the [[Warta River|Warta]] and [[Noteć]] rivers. [[Masuria]] occupies the remainder of northern Poland and features a string of larger lakes. Most of Poland's 9,300 lakes that are more than 10,000 square metres in area are located in the northern part of the lake region, where they occupy about 10% of the surface area.

The Baltic coastal plains are a low-lying region formed of sediments deposited by the sea. The coastline was shaped by the action of the rising sea after the [[Scandinavia]]n ice sheet retreated. The two major inlets in the smooth coast are the [[Pomeranian Bay]] on the German border in the far northwest and the Gulf of Gdańsk in the east. The Oder River empties into the former, and the Vistula forms a large delta at the head of the latter. Sandbars with large dunes form lagoons and coastal lakes along much of the coast.

==Geology==
[[File:Śląskie Kamienie - Dívči Kameny.JPG|thumb|left|[[Granite]] [[outcrop]] [[Śląskie Kamienie|Silesian Rocks]] at [[Krkonoše|Karkonosze]] in the [[Sudetes]], south-western Poland]]
The geological structure of Poland has been shaped by the [[continental collision]] of [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] over the past 60&amp;nbsp;million years on the one hand and the other by the [[Quaternary]] [[glacier|glaciations]] of northern Europe. Both processes shaped the [[Sudetes]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The moraine landscape of northern Poland contains soils made up mostly of sand or [[loam]], while the ice age [[river valley]]s of the south often contain [[loess]]. The Kraków-Częstochowa Upland, the [[Pieniny]], and the [[Western Tatras]] consist of [[limestone]], while the [[High Tatras]], the [[Beskids]], and the [[Karkonosze]] are made up mainly of [[granite]] and [[basalt]]s. The [[Polish Jura Chain]] is one of the oldest [[mountain range]]s on earth.

[[File:Giewont z Zakopanego.jpg|thumb|[[Giewont]] in the [[Tatra Mountains]]; the mountainous south is a popular destination for hikers]]
Poland has 70 mountains over {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} in elevation, all in the [[Tatras]]. The Polish Tatras, which consist of the High Tatras and the Western Tatras, is the highest mountain group of Poland and of the entire Carpathian range. In the High Tatras lies Poland's highest point, the north-western [[summit]] of [[Rysy]], {{convert|2499|m|ft|0}} in elevation. At its foot lies the mountain lakes of [[Czarny Staw pod Rysami]] (Black Lake below Mount Rysy), and [[Morskie Oko]] (the Marine Eye).

The second highest mountain group in Poland is the Beskids, whose highest peak is [[Babia Góra]], at {{convert|1725|m|ft|0}}. The next highest mountain groups is the [[Krkonoše|Karkonosze]] in the [[Sudetes]], whose highest point is [[Sněžka|Śnieżka]], at {{convert|1603|m|ft|0}}; [[Śnieżnik Mountains]] whose highest point is [[Králický Sněžník|Śnieżnik]], at {{convert|1425|m|ft|0}}.

Tourists also frequent the [[Bieszczady Mountains]] in the far southeast of Poland, whose highest point in Poland is [[Tarnica]], with an elevation of {{convert|1346|m|ft|0}}, [[Gorce Mountains]] in [[Gorce National Park]], whose highest point is [[Turbacz]], with elevations {{convert|1310|m|ft|0}}, and the [[Pieniny National Park (Poland)|Pieniny National Park]] in the [[Pieniny|Pieniny Mountains]], whose highest point is [[Trzy Korony]] with elevations of {{convert|982|m|ft|0}} (the highest mountain of this range, [[Wysokie Skałki]] (Wysoka), with elevations {{convert|1050|m|ft|0}}, is located outside of the national park). The lowest point in Poland – at {{convert|2|m|ft|1}} below sea level – is at Raczki Elbląskie, near [[Elbląg]] in the Vistula Delta.

The only [[desert]] located in Poland stretches over the [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]] (the Coal Fields of [[Dąbrowa Górnicza|Dąbrowa]]) region. It is called the [[Błędów Desert]], located in the [[Silesian Voivodeship]] in southern Poland. It has a total area of {{convert|32|km2|sqmi|0}}. It is one of only five natural [[List of deserts#Europe|deserts in Europe]]. But also, it is the warmest desert that appears at this [[latitude]]. Błędów Desert was created thousands of years ago by a [[melting glacier]]. The specific geological structure has been of big importance. The average thickness of the sand layer is about {{convert|40|m|ft|0}}, with a maximum of {{convert|70|m|ft|0}}, which made the fast and deep [[drainage]] very easy.

The Baltic Sea activity in [[Słowiński National Park]] created [[sand dunes]] which in the course of time separated [[Gdańsk Bay|the bay]] from the sea. As waves and wind carry sand inland the dunes slowly move, at a speed of {{convert|3|to|10|m|ft|1}} meters per year. Some dunes are quite high – up to {{convert|30|m|ft|0}}. The highest peak of the park – Rowokol ({{convert|115|m|ft|0|disp=or}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]) — is also an excellent [[observation point]].

Poland is the fourth most forested country in Europe. Forests cover about 30.5% of Poland's land area based on international standards.&lt;ref name="ref name=rapBIP" /&gt; Its overall percentage is still increasing. [[Forests of Poland]] are managed by the National Program of Reforestation (KPZL), aiming an increase of forest-coverage to 33% in 2050. The richness of Polish forests (per SoEF 2011 statistics) is more than twice as high as the European average (with German and French forests being at the top), containing 2.304 billion cubic metres of trees.&lt;ref name="ref name=rapBIP"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://bip.lasy.gov.pl/pl/bip/px_~raport_o_stanie_lasow_2011.pdf?page_opener=http%3A%2F%2Fbip.lasy.gov.pl%2Fpl%2Fbip%2Fraporty_i_prognozy | title=Raport o stanie lasów w Polsce (Report on the Status of Forests in Poland) | publisher=Dyrekcja Generalna Lasów Państwowych (Main Directorate of State Forest) | date=June 2012 | accessdate=14 September 2013 | author=Centrum Informacyjne Lasów Państwowych | page=8 | quote=Określona według standardu międzynarodowego lesistość Polski na koniec roku 2011 wynosiła 30,5%. | format=PDF file, direct download 4.12 MB | language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest forest complex in Poland is [[Lower Silesian Wilderness]].

More than 1% of Poland's territory, {{convert|3145|km2|sqmi}}, is protected within 23 [[List of national parks of Poland|Polish national parks]]. Three more national parks are projected for [[Masuria]], the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland, and the eastern [[Beskids]]. In addition, [[wetland]]s along lakes and rivers in central Poland are legally protected, as are coastal areas in the north. There are over 120 areas designated as [[Landscape Park (Poland)|landscape parks]], along with numerous [[nature reserve]]s and other [[Protected areas of Poland|protected areas]] (e.g. [[Natura 2000]]).

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Poland belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the territory of [[Ecoregions in Poland|Poland belongs to three Palearctic Ecoregions]] of the continental forest spanning Central and Northern European [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest]] ecoregions as well as the Carpathian [[Montane ecology|montane]] conifer forest.
[[File:Wisent.jpg|thumb|left|A [[wisent]] in the [[Białowieża Forest]]]]
Many animals that have since died out in other parts of Europe still survive in Poland, such as the [[wisent]] in the [[ancient woodland]] of the [[Białowieża Forest]] and in [[Podlaskie]]. Other such species include the [[brown bear]] in [[Białowieża]], in the Tatras, and in the Beskids, the [[gray wolf]] and the [[Eurasian lynx]] in various forests, the [[moose]] in northern Poland, and the [[beaver]] in Masuria, Pomerania, and Podlaskie.

In the forests, one also encounters game animals, such as [[red deer]], [[roe deer]] and [[wild boar]]s. In eastern Poland there are a number of ancient woodlands, like [[Białowieża forest]], that have never been cleared by people. There are also large forested areas in the mountains, Masuria, Pomerania, [[Lubusz Land]] and [[Lower Silesia]].

Poland is the most important breeding ground for a variety of European [[migratory birds]].&lt;ref name="poland.gov.pl-Fauna"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://en.poland.gov.pl/Fauna,309.html |title=Kingdom of birds |author=Ministry of Foreign Affairs |journal=Experience Poland » Geography » Environment » Fauna |year=2011 |quote=A real kingdom of birds is the Biebrza Basin, its wildlife making it one of the most unique areas in Poland.

==Hydrology==
{{see also|Rivers of Poland|Category:Lakes of Poland}}
[[File:Modlin spichlerz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vistula River]] in [[Modlin (Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki)|Modlin]]]]
The longest rivers are the [[Vistula River|Vistula]] ({{lang-pl|Wisła}}), {{convert|1047|km|mi}} long; the [[Oder River|Oder]] ({{lang-pl|Odra}}) which forms part of Poland's western border, {{convert|854|km|mi}} long; its tributary, the [[Warta]], {{convert|808|km|mi}} long; and the [[Bug River|Bug]], a tributary of the Vistula, {{convert|772|km|mi}} long. The Vistula and the Oder flow into the Baltic Sea, as do numerous smaller rivers in Pomerania.

The [[Łyna River|Łyna]] and the [[Angrapa River|Angrapa]] flow by way of the [[Pregolya]] to the Baltic, and the [[Czarna Hańcza]] flows into the Baltic through the [[Neman River|Neman]]. While the great majority of Poland's rivers drain into the Baltic Sea, Poland's Beskids are the source of some of the upper tributaries of the [[Orava River|Orava]], which flows via the [[Váh]] and the [[Danube]] to the [[Black Sea]]. The eastern Beskids are also the source of some streams that drain through the [[Dniester]] to the Black Sea.

Poland's rivers have been used since early times for navigation. The [[Viking]]s, for example, traveled up the Vistula and the Oder in their [[longship]]s. In the Middle Ages and in early modern times, when the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was the breadbasket of Europe;&lt;ref name="Snyder-111"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QJhMhTKw-vgC&amp;q=%22Commonwealth+became+the+breadbasket%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Commonwealth%20became%20the%20breadbasket%22&amp;f=false |title=The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569-1999 |publisher=Yale University Press |author=Timothy Snyder|author-link=Timothy Snyder |year=2003 |page=111 |isbn=0-300-12841-X |quote=Commonwealth became the breadbasket of Western Europe, wrote Timothy Snyder, thanks to the presence of fertile southeastern regions of Podolia and east Galicia.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the shipment of grain and other agricultural products down the Vistula toward [[Gdańsk]] and onward to other parts of Europe took on great importance.&lt;ref name="Snyder-111"/&gt;

With almost ten thousand closed bodies of water covering more than {{convert|1|ha|acre|2}} each, Poland has one of the highest numbers of lakes in the world. In Europe, only [[Finland]] has a greater density of lakes.&lt;ref name="Walske-28"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dx2AgAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22a+higher+density+of+lakes+than+Poland%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22a%20higher%20density%20of%20lakes%20than%20Poland%22&amp;f=false |title=Poland |publisher=ABDO Publishing |author=Christine Zuchora-Walske |year=2013 |page=28 |isbn=1-61480-877-5 |chapter=The Lakes Region |quote=''Insert:'' Poland is home to 9,300 lakes.

In addition to the lake districts in the north (in Masuria, Pomerania, [[Kashubians|Kashubia]], Lubuskie, and [[Greater Poland]]), there is also a large number of mountain lakes in the Tatras, of which the Morskie Oko is the largest in area. The lake with the greatest depth—of more than {{convert|100|m|ft|0}}—is [[Hańcza|Lake Hańcza]] in the Wigry Lake District, east of Masuria in [[Podlaskie Voivodeship]].

[[File:Solina Poland.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lake Solina]] near [[Lesko]] in southeastern Poland]]
Among the first lakes whose shores were settled are those in the Greater Polish Lake District. The [[stilt house]] settlement of [[Biskupin]], occupied by more than one thousand residents, was founded before the 7th century BC by people of the [[Lusatian culture]].

Lakes have always played an important role in Polish history and continue to be of great importance to today's modern Polish society. The ancestors of today's Poles, the [[Polans (western)|Polanie]], built their first fortresses on islands in these lakes. The legendary Prince [[Popiel]] ruled from [[Kruszwica]] tower erected on the [[Gopło|Lake Gopło]].&lt;ref name="Chronicles-93"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8_rUrXWSsUC&amp;q=Gop%C5%82o-Kruszwica+Popiel#v=snippet&amp;q=Gop%C5%82o-Kruszwica%20Popiel&amp;f=false |title=Jewish Poland &amp;ndash; legends of Origin: Ethnopoetics and Legendary Chronicles |publisher=Wayne State University Press |author=Ḥayah Bar-Yitsḥaḳ |year=2001 |page=93 |isbn=0-8143-2789-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first historically documented ruler of Poland, Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], had his palace on an island in the Warta River in [[Poznań]].

The Polish Baltic coast is approximately {{convert|528|km|mi|0}} long and extends from [[Świnoujście]] on the islands of [[Usedom]] and [[Wolin]] in the west to [[Krynica Morska]] on the Vistula Spit in the east. For the most part, Poland has a smooth coastline, which has been shaped by the continual movement of sand by currents and winds. This continual [[erosion]] and [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] has formed cliffs, dunes, and spits, many of which have migrated landwards to close off former lagoons, such as Łebsko Lake in Słowiński National Park.

Prior to the end of the [[Second World War]] and subsequent [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|change in national borders]], Poland had only a very small coastline; this was situated at the end of the '[[Polish Corridor]]', the only internationally recognised Polish territory which afforded the country access to the sea. However, after World War II, the redrawing of Poland's borders and resulting 'shift' of the country's borders left it with a greatly expanded coastline, thus allowing for far greater access to the sea than was ever previously possible. The significance of this event, and importance of it to Poland's future as a major industrialised nation, was alluded to by the 1945 [[Poland's Wedding to the Sea|Wedding to the Sea]].

The largest spits are [[Hel Peninsula]] and the [[Vistula Spit]]. The largest Polish Baltic island is [[Wolin]]. The largest sea [[harbour]]s are [[Port of Szczecin|Szczecin]], [[Port of Świnoujście|Świnoujście]], [[Port of Gdańsk|Gdańsk]], [[Port of Gdynia|Gdynia]], [[Port of Police|Police]] and [[Port of Kołobrzeg|Kołobrzeg]]. The main coastal resorts are [[Świnoujście]], [[Międzyzdroje]] (Misdroy), [[Kołobrzeg]], [[Łeba]], [[Sopot]], [[Władysławowo]] and the Hel Peninsula.

===Drainage===
[[File:PolandSzczecinPanorama.JPG|left|thumb|[[Oder]] in [[Szczecin]]]]
Nearly all of Poland is swirled northward into the Baltic Sea by the [[Vistula River|Vistula]], the [[Oder River|Oder]], and the tributaries of these two major rivers. About half the country is drained by the Vistula, which originates in the [[Silesian Beskids]] in far south-central Poland.

The [[Vistula Basin]] includes most of the eastern half of the country and is drained by a system of rivers that mainly join the Vistula from the east. One of the tributaries, the [[Bug River|Bug]], defines 280 kilometers of Poland's eastern border with Ukraine and Belarus.

The Oder and its major tributary, the [[Warta River|Warta]], and a few smaller rivers as [[Kłodnica]], [[Mała Panew]], [[Bóbr]], [[Lusatian Neisse]] (Nysa Łużycka) and [[Ina (river)|Ina]], form a basin that drains the western third of Poland into the [[Bay of Szczecin]]. The drainage effect on a large part of Polish terrain is weak, however, especially in the lake region and the inland areas to its south. The predominance of [[swamp]]land, level terrain, and small, shallow lakes hinders large-scale movement of water. The rivers have two high-water periods per year. The first is caused by melting snow and ice dams in spring adding to the volume of lowland rivers; the second is caused by heavy rains in July.

==Climate==
[[File:Poland Köppen.svg|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification]] types of Poland]]
[[File:Plaża w Pucku - kitesurfers - beach in Puck (4).jpg|thumb|The average daytime summer temperature at sea level along the Baltic coast is {{convert|22|°C|°F|1}}.&lt;ref name="zalewszczecinski"&gt;{{cite web|author =|url = http://zalewszczecinski.net/akweny/wybrzeze-morza-baltyckiego|title = Wybrzeże Morza Bałtyckiego|work = www.zalewszczecinski.net|publisher =|pages =|page =|date =|accessdate = 16 November 2009|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bay of Puck]] (''Zatoka Pucka'')]]

Poland's long-term and short-term weather patterns are made transitional and variable by the collision of diverse air masses above the country's surface. Maritime air moves across [[Western Europe]], [[Arctic]] air sweeps down from the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], and subtropical air arrives from the [[South Atlantic Ocean]]. Although the Polar air dominates for much of the year, its conjunction with warmer currents generally moderates temperatures and generates considerable [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], clouds, and fog. When the moderating influences are lacking, winter temperatures in mountain valleys may drop to a minimum of {{convert|-20|°C}}.

The spring arrives slowly in March or April, bringing mainly sunny days after a period of alternating wintertime and springtime conditions. Summer, which extends from June to August, is generally less humid than winter. Showers and thunderstorms alternate with dry sunny weather that is generated when southern and eastern winds prevail. Early autumn is generally sunny and warm before a period of rainy, colder weather in November begins the transition into winter. Winter, which may last from one to three months, brings frequent snowstorms but relatively low total precipitation.

[[File:Tarnow Rynek 20080708 4153.jpg|thumb|left|A sunny morning in [[Tarnów]]]]
The range of mean temperatures is {{convert|6|°C|1}} in the northeast to {{convert|10|°C}} in the southwest, but individual readings in Poland's regions vary widely by season. On the highest mountain peaks, the mean temperature is below {{convert|0|°C}}. The Baltic coast, influenced by moderating west winds, mostly in [[Świnoujście]], [[Międzyzdroje]], [[Dziwnów]], [[Nowe Warpno]], [[Police, West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Police]] and [[Szczecin]], has cooler summers and warmer winters. The other temperature extreme is in the southeast along the border with Ukraine, where the greatest seasonal differences occur and winter temperatures average 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C below those in western Poland. The hottest cities in Poland are [[Tarnów]], [[Wrocław]] and [[Słubice]].

[[File:Park zdrojowy, 1827, 1939, po 1945 (73).JPG|thumb|Summer in the Spa-Park in the resort of [[Świnoujście]]]]
The average temperatures are rising,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ekoedu.uw.edu.pl/rep/pdf/22fe31f808780c906db3ae3df0bb1728.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; however. In the period of 1980 to 2010, there were 19 Decembers without snow, and in the period of 2000 to 2010 seven. December 2006 was the warmest one in Poland since 1779. In most of Poland, average temperatures rose by 3-5 degrees Celsius during the last three decades.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.twojapogoda.pl/artykuly/113139,grudnie-coraz-mniej-sniezne-i-cieplejsze&lt;/ref&gt;

The average annual precipitation for the whole country is {{convert|600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, but isolated mountain areas receive as much as {{convert|1300|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year. The total is slightly higher in the southern uplands than in the central plains. A few areas, notably along the Vistula between [[Warsaw]] and the Baltic Sea and in the far northwest, average less than {{convert|500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. In winter about half the precipitation in the lowlands and the entire amount in the mountains falls as snow. On average, precipitation in summer is twice of that in winter, providing a dependable supply of water for crops. The growing season is about 40 days longer in the southwest than in the northeast, where spring arrives latest.

==Political geography==
{{main|Administrative divisions of Poland}}

Poland's current [[Voivodeships of Poland|voivodeships]] (provinces) are largely based on the country's historic regions, whereas those of the past two decades (to 1998) had been centred on and named for individual cities. The new units range in area from less than {{convert|10000|km2|sqmi}} for Opole Voivodeship to more than {{convert|35000|km2|sqmi}} for Masovian Voivodeship. Administrative authority at voivodeship level is shared between a government-appointed [[voivode]] (governor), an elected regional assembly (''[[Voivodeship sejmik|sejmik]]'') and an executive elected by that assembly.

The voivodeships are subdivided into ''[[powiat]]s'' (often referred to in English as counties), and these are further divided into ''[[gmina]]s'' (also known as communes or municipalities). Major cities normally have the status of both ''gmina'' and ''powiat''. Poland has 16 voivodeships, 379 powiats (including 65 cities with ''powiat'' status), and 2,478 ''gminas''.

==Position in Europe==
Linguistically, Poland may be placed in [[Eastern Europe]] because the official and most widely spoken language of the state is [[Polish language|Polish]] – one of the [[West Slavic languages]] generally associated with the eastern section of the continent.&lt;ref name="AATSEEL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aatseel.org/resources/why/individual.htm#polish |title= American Association of Teachers of Slavic and East European Languages |publisher= AATSEEL |accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using historical and cultural criteria, Poland can be identified as [[Western Europe]] as well, due to customs and cuisine it used to share with [[Italy]],&lt;ref name="Heritage"/&gt; and [[France]].&lt;ref name="niam.pl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Urlewicz"/&gt; For instance, Queen [[Bona Sforza]] revolutionized Polish eating habits after 1518 with unknown vegetables, fruits and legumes which became Poland's staples for centuries to come.&lt;ref name="Heritage"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UtA6-pyGJmMC&amp;q=Bona+Sforza+1518+#v=snippet&amp;q=Bona%20Sforza%201518&amp;f=false |title=Polish Heritage Cookery |publisher=Hippocrene Books |year=2005 |accessdate=10 October 2014 |author=Robert Strybel, Maria Strybel |pages=11, 513 |isbn=0781811244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary times, Poland is leaning politically westwards – as a member of the [[European Union|EU]]&lt;ref name="The 2004 enlargement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/enlargement/2004_and_2007_enlargement/e50017_en.htm|title=EU 2004 Enlargement|publisher=Europa.eu|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]],&lt;ref name="NATO's Enlargement to the East"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/acad/fellow/98-00/schimmelfennig.pdf |title=NATO's Enlargement to the East|author=Frank Schimmelfennig|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; its government maintains generally close ties with Western Europe and the [[Poland–United States relations|United States of America]]. Some argue that Eastern Europe is defined as a region with main characteristics consisting of [[Byzantine]], [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]], and some [[Ottoman Empire|Turco-Islamic]] influences. Although the Orthodox [[Ruthenians]] and Islamic [[Lipka Tatars]] together made up a large part of Poland's population throughout history, the Polish state and most ethnic [[Poles]] have embraced [[Catholicism]];&lt;ref name=repgus2012&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/RS_rocznik_statystyczny_rp_2012.pdf | title = Rocznik statystyczny Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej 2012 | author = Główny Urząd Statystyczny | publisher = Zakład Wydawnictw Statystycznych | place = Warszawa | year = 2012}} {{pl icon}}/{{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as such, Poland is excluded from this category. Some scholars agree that Poland, [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]] and the [[Czech Republic]] are Central European states due to their shared [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] heritage.&lt;ref name="Definitions of regions in Europe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotf.edu/earthinfo/balkans/BKdef.html|title=Definitions of regions in Europe|publisher=Global Perspectives|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economically, due to its membership in the [[Visegrád Group]],&lt;ref name="Visegrád Group"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visegradgroup.eu/about|title=Visegrád Group |publisher= Visegrád Group|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poland is sometimes grouped together with the [[Visegrád Group|V4]] states and [[Germany]] as part of [[Mitteleuropa]] ([[Central Europe]]).&lt;ref name="Bischof2000p558"&gt;Bischof ''et al.''

[[Image:groenendaal-wandelkaart.jpg|thumb|300px|A map of Groenendaal park from the 1950s.]]
'''Groenendaal park''' lies at the center of [[Heemstede]], Netherlands. 
The park includes the grounds of old Heemstede country estates [[Bosbeek]], and [[Meer en Berg]]. Along its western borders are the old Heemstede country estates [[Hartekamp]], [[Huis te Manpad]], and [[Iepenrode]]. On the eastern boundary is the city cemetery.

==History==
In the 17th century Groenendaal was mostly sand dunes. The sand was dug and sold to barges that carried it to Amsterdam for building purposes. Later the resulting fields were used for bleaching linen, and still later for growing tulip bulbs. During the heyday of the tulip craze, Amsterdam merchants purchased land in the Haarlem-Heemstede area for summer homes. Groenendaal park is situated at the site of the former summer home of Amsterdam banker [[Jan Hope]], whose estate [[Bosbeek]] was the first example of a large garden in the 'English Style' in the 18th century in the Netherlands. The grounds are part of a long sandy ridge of deciduous forest running in a straight line from the Hague to Alkmaar. The park was designed by John Hope in 1760 and remained in his family for 3 generations. It was purchased by Heemstede and made into a public park in 1913. It has been the scene of two international flower shows, the Flora of 1935 and the Flora of 1953..

==Steam engine==
[[Jan Hope]] installed the first steam engine for garden use at the site of this windmill in 1781, which had an opposite purpose than most Dutch windmills. He wanted to pump water into his estate to grow the unusual plants and trees he had cultivated in the dry sand. Dutch windmills are normally used for pumping water out of places. He first built a small windmill much like the one standing today. After hearing of power to be had from steam, he wrote to [[James Watt]] and [[Matthew Boulton]] to order an improved version of the [[Thomas Newcomen|Newcomen]] engine. When the big red copper kettle arrived, it was installed by Rinse Lieve Brouwer. In circa 1850 the steam engine was broken down and the copper kettle sold for scrap. The steam engine had a dual purpose; one was to pump water into the garden, en the other was to act as an attraction in and of itself. In the 18th century garden owners went to great lengths to decorate their gardens to attract visitors.

The attraction of a steam engine became obsolete when the [[Museum De Cruquius|Cruquius]] steam engine mill was built down the road. In 1850 the Cruquius mill, together with two others, took 3 years to pump out the [[Haarlemmermeer|Haarlem lake]].

A '''hanging garden''' is a [[sustainable landscape architecture]], an artistic [[garden]] or a small urban farm: attached to or built on a wall. They are mainly found in areas where land is scarce or where the farmer is mobile or not permanent.

==History==
The most famous hanging gardens were the legendary [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]]. They were considered in [[ancient history|antiquity]] as one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]], and were located in present-day [[Iraq]].

==Modern==
In contemporary use, hanging gardens are a [[green wall]] on a ground level facade, a balcony, a [[terrace (building)|terrace]], or part of a [[roof garden]]; of a home, or [[skyrise greenery]] with a residential, commercial, or government office building.

==Products==
Prefabricated modular hanging wall garden systems have been developed and are on the market internationally.

'''Houseplant care''' is the act of [[wikt:growth|growing]] [[houseplant]]s and ensuring they have the necessary conditions for survival and continuing growth. This includes providing [[soil]] with sufficient [[nutrient]]s, correct lighting conditions, air circulation and adding the right amount of [[water]].

Watering houseplants on a regular basis is necessary for the plant to remain healthy and thrive. They should not, however, be watered on a scheduled basis, because different plant species need different amounts of water and [[sunlight]] so it is important to know the specifics for the particular plants that are being grown.

Houseplants sometimes also need to be cleaned of dust and greasy films that collect on the leaves when they are indoors. Dusty, grimy leaves can inhibit growth.

==Data for some common houseplants==

===Light requirements===
The meaning of Low-Medium-High depends on the context. For example, in orchid literature 1,500 foot-candle is referred to as Low Light.

Most plants will survive [[illuminance]] 10 times lower than listed below but will not grow as well or bloom.

* Low (500–2,500 lux; 50–250 foot-candles)
* Medium (2,500–10,000 lux; 250–1,000 foot-candles)
* High (10,000–20,000 lux; 1,000–2,000 foot-candles)
* Very High (20,000–50,000 lux; 2,000–5,000 foot-candles)

===Temperature requirement===
Most plants grown as houseplants are selected because they are already adapted to growing at typical house temperatures, between 15° and 25°C. Exceptions do occur, and some plants require chilling periods at lower temperatures (down to 5° or 10°) in winter when less light is available. &lt;!-- to be expanded --&gt;

===Air circulation requirements===
Since almost all of the air circulation (transpiration) happens in the roots as does almost all of the energy production, the roots must be able to breathe easily. Overwatering will drown a typical houseplant. The air is pulled through the soil by the breathing of the roots. Air must be able to flow through the soil.

===Water requirement===
The amount of water a particular houseplant needs is influenced by several factors. Not only is the individual plant size and species important, but also the growing conditions. Light, temperature, humidity, container type, container size, and soil type all influence the speed of growth and therefore the amount of water needed. Further, it is best to look up individual plant types for their watering needs.

===Nutrition requirements===
Houseplants in a controlled production greenhouse are kept in an ideal conditions for rapid growth. Some plants and production flowers are even hybridized for fast growth characteristics.
Nutritional needs of a plant in a production green house are greater than in a typical personal house plant environment where humidity, light, irrigation, and air circulation are not ideal. After being removed from the production greenhouse the plant slows evapotranspiration. Likewise after being brought into a typical household the watering and nutitional requirements decline, the plants growth rate declines and the nutritional needs decline. Plants use most of the carbon that they release from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to create energy but some of the carbon feeds plant growth. Far less plant food comes from the soil.

'''Krishna Singh Rawat''' (also known as '''Kishen Singh''') was an Indian explorer and cartographer, what the British called a ''[[pundit (explorer)|pundit]]'', the cousin of the explorer [[Nain Singh Rawat]]. He came from [[Dehradun]].

Singh's last and greatest journey commenced in 1878. He followed the northern trade route from [[Lhasa]] to [[Xinjiang]] and [[China]]. He followed the route all the way to [[Dunhuang]], and on his way back explored the eastern [[Tibet]] border region. At one point the caravan leader wanted the caravan to go by horse to cross a [[bandit]]-ridden area faster. Krishna, unable to count his steps during this period, measured the distance (230 miles) by counting his [[horse|horse's]] steps instead.

{{more citations needed|date=June 2011}}
This is a list of songs from the [[Disney Channel]]'s [[List of Disney Channel series|original series]], ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''.

== List of songs ==

===Theme Song===
The show's theme song is called "Today is Gonna Be a Great Day" performed by [[Bowling For Soup]]. There is a Christmas version for "[[Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation]]", a Halloween version for "That's the Spirit" and "The Curse of Candace", a winter version for "For Your Ice Only" and "Happy New Year!" and another Halloween version for "Druselsteinoween", "Terrifying Tri-State Trilogy of Terror", and "Face Your Fear". An adaptation was also made for the [[2011 Little League World Series]].

=== Season One ===
The first season of ''Phineas and Ferb'' was composed of 47 episodes, and 69 songs. It is focused on [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb]] with their crazed inventions, as [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] attempts to bust them. Also, [[Perry the Platypus]] fights his battles against his nemesis, [[Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz]]. The two songless episodes "Rollercoaster" and "Lights, Candace, Action" are not listed because they do not have songs.

[[File:John S. Stokes, Jr. in Mary Garden.jpg|thumb|[http://ecommons.udayton.edu/imri_stokes_photos/6/ John S. Stokes, Jr. in his Mary Garden, 1982]. Image courtesy of [http://ecommons.udayton.edu/imri_stokes/ John Stokes and Mary's Gardens Collection], University of Dayton Libraries.]]

A '''Mary garden''' is a small [[sacred garden]] enclosing a statue or shrine of the [[Virgin Mary]], who is known to many [[Christian]]s as the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin]], [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Our Lady]], or the [[Mother of God]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} page 341&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Testament]], Mary is the mother of [[Jesus of Nazareth]]. Mary gardens are most common to those Christian denominations which hold the Virgin Mary in special esteem, particularly [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Anglican]]s.

==History==
{{Roman Catholic Mariology}}
The practice originated among monasteries and convents in [[medieval Europe]]. During the Middle Ages, people saw reminders of Mary in the flowers and herbs growing around them.&lt;ref name=krymow&gt;[https://www.franciscanmedia.org/honoring-mary-in-your-garden/ Krymow, Vincenzina and Frisk, M. Jean. "Honoring Mary in Your Garden", St. Anthony Messenger]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roberson"&gt;
[https://www.udayton.edu/imri/mary/h/herbs-and-flowers-of-the-virgin-mary.php/ "Herbs and Flowers of the Virgin Mary", Marian Library, University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt;
The first reference to an actual garden dedicated to Mary is from the life of [[Saint Fiacre|St. Fiacre]], Irish patron saint of gardening, who planted and tended a garden around the oratory to Our Lady he built at his famous hospice for the poor and infirm in France in the 7th Century. The first record of a flower actually named for Mary is that of "seint mary gouldes" (St. Mary's Gold or Marygold) for the [[Pot Marigold]] or ''[[Calendula]]'', in a 1373 English recipe for a potion to ward off the plague.&lt;ref name=johnsstokes&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/HISTPERS.HTM Stokes Jr., John S., "Mary Gardens Historical Perspective", 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern revival==
The first such garden open to the public in the United States was founded in 1932 at St. Joseph's Church, [[Woods Hole]], [[Cape Cod]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=stokes&gt;[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/m/mary-garden-woods-hole-mass.php "Mary's Gardens", Marian Library, University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt; This garden was founded by Frances Crane Lillie, a summer resident of Woods Hole. It was Lillie's recollection of the symbolic herbs and flowers that she had encountered in England that prompted her to conceive and donate a Mary Garden to St. Joseph's Church.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.udayton.edu/imri/mary/h/herbs-and-flowers-of-the-virgin-mary.php/ "The Herbs and Flowers of the Virgin Mary", Marian Library, University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the St. Joseph's Mary Garden in Woods Hole, Edward A. G. McTague and John S. Stokes, Jr. founded "Mary's Gardens" of Philadelphia in 1951 as a project to research flowers identified with Mary, and make available seeds and plant source information for starting Mary Gardens. They also initiated a series of articles in religious publications to encourage the planting of Mary gardens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/HISTPERS.htm/ Stokes Jr., John S., "Mary Gardens in Historical Perspective", 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A Mary garden may be a single indoor pot, a large plot outdoors, or anything in between. They can be found at parishes, schools, homes, shrines, convents and other institutions.&lt;ref name=denver&gt;[http://www.archden.org/index.cfm/ID/1943 Filby, Julie. "Mary garden: a flower-enhanced tranquil spot to reflect on the Blessed Mother", ''Denver Catholic Register'', April 22,2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue of Mary, sometimes holding the [[Madonna and Child|Infant Christ]], is central to the garden. Select flowers, shrubs, and trees associated with the legends about Mary are planted in the garden. Such plants may include [[Bay Laurel|laurel tree]]s, strawberries, [[Cypripedioideae|ladyslippers]], [[lily of the valley|lilies of the valley]], [[peony|peonies]], [[Viola (plant)|violet]]s, [[Iris (plant)|iris]]es and roses, all of which are identified as [[Flower#Symbolism|symbolic]] and significant in the story of Mary as recounted in the Bible and other Christian stories. Gardens may have benches and a facility for lighting [[votive candle]]s.

It demonstrates [[Roman Catholic devotions|devotional]] commitment through the [[spiritual practice]] of designing, building and maintaining the garden and for the attendance, [[contemplation]], and prayers of visitors. Mary gardens are similar to the [[Zen]] [[Zen garden|meditation gardens]] found in the [[Buddhist]] tradition, with the exception that a Mary Garden pays homage to a person, the Virgin Mary, whereas a meditation garden in the East Asian traditions does not focus on a person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moplants.com/archives/mary_garden.php Create a Mary Garden]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="krymow"/&gt;

==Flowers associated with Mary==
More than 30 flowers and herbs are connected to legends about Mary’s life.&lt;ref name="krymow"/&gt;
*Lily: Mary was associated with this passage from the Song of Songs: "I am the Rose of Sharon, the lily of the valleys." (2:1) A legend from the second century says that when Mary's tomb was opened to show Thomas that her body had been assumed into heaven, it was filled with roses and lilies.&lt;ref name="udayton.edu"&gt;[https://www.udayton.edu/imri/mary/m/may-flowers.php/ "May flowers", Marian Library, University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Columbine: also known as "Our Lady's Shoes", is said to have sprung up wherever Mary’s foot touched the ground on her way to visit her cousin Elizabeth.&lt;ref name="krymow"/&gt;
* Lavender: “Mary’s Drying Plant” was said to have received its scent after Mary laid Jesus’ clothes on it to dry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archden.org/index.cfm/ID/1943/ Filby, Julie. "Mary garden: a flower-enhanced tranquil spot to reflect on the Blessed Mother", ''Denver Catholic Register'', April 22,2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Madonna Lily: The angel Gabriel is said to have been holding a lily, representing purity, when he appeared to Mary to announce she would bear a child; lilies are often included in artistic renditions of the annunciation.&lt;ref name="denver"/&gt;
* The marigold was called "Mary's Gold" by early Christians who placed the flowers around statues of Mary, offering the blossoms in place of coins. A legend says that during the flight into Egypt the Holy Family was accosted by a band of thieves. They took Mary's purse and when they opened it, marigolds fell out.&lt;ref name="udayton.edu"/&gt;
* The violet is associated with humility and became known as "Our Lady's Modesty". It was said to have blossomed when Mary replied to the Angel Gabriel, "I am the handmaid of the Lord."&lt;ref name="udayton.edu"/&gt;
*Irises were used in Mary Gardens. The blade-shaped foliage denotes the sorrows which 'pierced her heart.'

The '''Monte Desert''' is a [[South American]] [[ecoregion]], lying entirely within [[Argentina]] and covering approximately the submontane areas of [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]], [[La Rioja Province, Argentina|La Rioja]], [[San Juan Province, Argentina|San Juan]], [[San Luis Province|San Luis]] and [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]] Provinces, plus the western half of [[La Pampa Province]] and the extreme north of [[Río Negro Province]]. The desert lies southeast of the [[Atacama Desert]] in [[Chile]], north of the larger [[Patagonian Desert]], east of the [[Andes]] and west of the [[Sierras de Córdoba|Sierra de Córdoba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ege.fcen.uba.ar/ecodes/Proyectos/Area/Monte_eng.htm Monte Desert] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531193314/http://www.ege.fcen.uba.ar/Ecodes/Proyectos/Area/Monte_eng.htm |date=2011-05-31 }} Desert Community Ecology research team&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and climate==
{{see also|Arid Diagonal}}
The delineations between the Monte Desert, the Atacama Desert, and the Patagonian Desert are not exact and the desert seems to be more-or-less continuous with the other two nearby deserts. The geography of the land is very similar to that of the interior Patagonian Desert, with volcanic sediments, [[Piedmont (disambiguation)|piedmont]] plains, large mountain blocks and many usually dry salt lakes. The major river is the [[Colorado River (Argentina)|Río Colorado]] and its tributary the [[Río Desaguadero]], which meet in the south of the region and provide its principal source of irrigation water for wine crops.

Due to the region lying on the eastern, or [[leeward]], side of the Andes and west of the Sierra de Córdoba, it experiences very little rain. These [[rain shadow]] effects are the primary reason for the aridity of the region and the formation of the Monte and other nearby deserts. Although a difference between this desert and the other two deserts is the lack of intensity of effect from the cold water currents off the South American coast for the Monte Desert. This allows the desert to support a wider variety of life than the other two more extreme deserts.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, John; Lucas, Rob. [https://books.google.com/books?id=oSl_snNdP1EC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=%22monte+desert%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;sig=CbxwJPGhKYtHikNo6eeznLjR3Gg The Nature Of Plants: Habitats, Challenges, and Adaptations]. 2005 Timber Press. {{ISBN|0-88192-675-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
The flora of the region is much more diverse than the nearby Patagonian Desert (which contains mainly shrubs and grasses) and the Atacama Desert (which is pretty much devoid of life). Shrubs and grasses are not only common, but tall [[Cactus|cacti]] even appear in the more hospitable areas of the desert.

The fauna of the area is also very similar to that of the Patagonian Desert, only in greater diversity and number due to the Monte's more hospitable conditions. Small mammals like mice abound and larger animals like the [[guanaco]] and [[burrowing owl]] can be found as well.

Straddled on the ridge of  Mount Titano is the city of San Marino of the Republic of San Marino, the [[History of San Marino|history of which]] dates from the early 4th century. According to the legend related to the Mount and its precincts a small monastery existed on top of the Mount during the 8th century. The mountainous landscape provides excellent views of its surroundings, and its isolated location ensured the needed seclusion for San Marino to survive as a Republic over the past several centuries.&lt;ref name=mount/&gt;&lt;ref name=travel&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/521449/San-Marino/236529/Geography?anchor=ref101628|title= Travel &amp; Geography: Mount Titano|accessdate=2010-11-03|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==

The mountain has three peaks; on each is one of [[The Three Towers of San Marino]]. [[Saint Marinus]] is always represented with Mount Titano in his hands.&lt;ref name=travel/&gt;&lt;ref name= Haggett &gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= Haggett |first= Peter|encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of world geography, Volume 11|page=1461|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQgXLCQVFXsC&amp;pg=PA1461|publisher= Marshall Cavendish|year=2002|isbn=0-7614-7300-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=discover&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geography.howstuffworks.com/europe/geography-of-san-marino.htm|title= Geography of San Marino|accessdate=2010-11-03|publisher=How Discoveryworks: A Discovery Company}}{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and environment==
Monte Titano is located in central [[San Marino]] (seen in maps in rough rectangular shape), to the southeast of the [[City of San Marino]] and to the north of the village of [[Murata (San Marino)|Murata]], at a distance of {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Adriatic Coast.&lt;ref name=travel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beyond&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitsanmarino.com/default.asp?id=84 |title=Beyond geography |accessdate=2010-11-03 |publisher=Republic Di Martino: Visitsanmarino.com |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617142910/http://www.visitsanmarino.com/default.asp?id=84 |archivedate=June 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map|title=[[Google Maps]]|publisher=Google|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map|title=[[Bing Maps]]|publisher= [[Microsoft]] and [[Harris Corporation]] Earthstar Geographics LLC|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monte Titano looks like a rugged limestone outcrop, located only 13 kilometres (a figure of 10&amp;nbsp;km is mentioned in another reference) from the [[Adriatic Sea]] on the Apennines. Although the highest point is 739 metres above sea level, the rocky outcrop is about 200 metres in height at most. From the top of Monte Titano views of the entire nation of San Marino and further afield can be viewed scenically. The mountain gives birth to several streams, including the [[San Marino River]], which flows down its western slope through a broad valley&lt;ref&gt;''Scottish geographical magazine'', Volumes 39–40, Royal Scottish Geographical Society, (1923)&lt;/ref&gt; and flows into the Marecchia River, through [[Marecchia Torello]] and into the Adriatic Sea {{convert|23|km|mi|abbr=on}} away and the [[Cando River]], born in [[Marano]], which flows into the Adriatic coast between [[Rimini]] and [[Riccione Ausa]]. The terrain has fertile soils in Emilia Romagna plain and soft rolling hills in the Marche and Montefeltro region. The mountain dips into the calm Adriatic sea.&lt;ref name=travel/&gt;&lt;ref name =Beyond/&gt;

During the [[Tertiary|Tertiary era]], the area where San Marino lies was the sea. Violent earthquakes caused major upheavals in the Earth's surface. Because of these intensive earthquakes, a mass of rock situated about {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the mountain, was lifted and slid slowly toward the Adriatic Sea. This mass of rock gave rise to various mountains, including Mount Titano. The vertebrate fossils found on the slopes of Mount Titano are mostly aquatic in origin, because of the fact this rock was once located underneath the sea in its current spot. Fossils of various fish, especially the fossils of [[shark teeth]] have been discovered on Monte Titano, with many dated to the [[Miocene]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawley, R.|year=1880|title=Selache manzoni n. sp. – Dente fossile délia molassa miocenica del Monte Titano (Repubblica di San Marino).|publisher=Atti della Società Toscana di Scienze Naturali, 5: |pages=167–172, fig. 1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important fossil discovery is that of a whale, which is now preserved in the [[Bologna Archaeological Museum]].

The precincts of Monte Titano and the San Marino city experiences mild temperate climate; the maximum temperatures reported is of 79&amp;nbsp;°F (26&amp;nbsp;°C) in summer while the minimum is 19&amp;nbsp;°F (−7&amp;nbsp;°C) in winter. Annual precipitation varies from about 22&amp;nbsp;inches (560&amp;nbsp;mm) to 32&amp;nbsp;inches (800&amp;nbsp;mm).

==Flora and fauna==
Set in the Mediterranean zone the vegetation is typical influenced by elevation variations. Numerous trees inhabit the mountain, including [[chestnut]]s, [[oak]]s, [[laburnum]], [[cypress]], [[fir tree]]s and some shrubs and [[asparagus]], typical of the driest areas, such as the territory in the [[Three Towers of San Marino]] vicinity. On the cliffs of Mount Titano is also found ''[[Ephedra Nebrodensis]]'', a plant typical of [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]].

Wildlife is represented by all classes of vertebrates and, given the characteristics of the mountainous territory, birds and mammals are the most common animals. In relation to birds, several can be mentioned such as the [[kestrel]], [[barn owl]], [[owl]], [[tawny owl]], the [[magpie]] and [[buzzard]]s.  Common animal life includes [[roe deer]], [[wild boar]], [[deer]], [[weasel]]s, [[marten]], [[porcupine]], [[hare]], [[hedgehog]]s, [[European polecat|polecats]], [[badger]]s and [[fox]]es.&lt;ref name=travel/&gt;

==Protected area==
Since 2008, Monte Titano was allocated as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], in tandem with the historic centre of San Marino. The reason given by the Committee refers to "witnessing the continuity of a free republic since Middle Ages. "&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1245/|title=San Marino|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This heritage site include the towers, walls, gates and bastions of the City of San Marino, the [[Basilica di San Marino]] of the nineteenth century, some convents of the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, the eighteenth century [[Teatro Titano]] Theatre and the [[Palazzo Pubblico]] of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt;

The layout of the Mount Titano presents three peaks, each crowned by ancient towers named Guaita, Cesta and Montale, with triple fortifications that enclose the capital city. Each tower in turn has a metal vane fixed on it which is in the shape of an ostrich plume, ("perhaps a pun on the Italian ''penne'', meaning "plumes") which is attributed to the name of the mountains. Those three towers are represented in the coat of arms of in the central part of the National Flag (horizontal white and blue) of the country (which has a width to length ratio of 3 to 4). The capital city is set on the western side of Mount Titano.&lt;ref name=travel/&gt;&lt;ref name=flag&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1355487/San-Marino-flag-of?anchor=ref716883|title= Flag of San Marino|accessdate=2010-11-03|encyclopedia =Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; An urban network of roads links the fortresses.&lt;ref name=discover/&gt;

'''Oscar Ferdinand Peschel''' (17 March 1826, [[Dresden]] &amp;ndash; 13 August 1875, [[Leipzig]]) was a German [[geographer]] and [[anthropologist]].&lt;ref&gt;The little encyclopedia Encyclios-Verlag, Zurich, 1950, Volume 2, Page 342&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

As the son of an officer and teacher at the local [[military school]], Peschel studied law from 1845 to 1848 in Leipzig and [[Heidelberg]]. In 1850 he joined the editorial staff of the ''Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung''. In 1854 he took over the editorship for the journal ''Das Ausland'',&lt;ref name=DB&gt;[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz94751.html Peschel, Oscar Ferdinand] @ NDB/ADB Deutsche Biographie&lt;/ref&gt; of which he continued until the end of March 1871.

In 1871 he became a full professor of the newly established chair of geography at the [[University of Leipzig]].&lt;ref name=DB/&gt; This is thus the fourth oldest chair of geography in Germany after [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and [[University of Bonn|Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;Sabine Höhler: World areas. Campus-Verlag , 2005, page 122&lt;/ref&gt;

Peschel 1858 corresponding member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences]]. Shortly before his death he was also a regular member of the Royal Saxon Society of Sciences in Leipzig.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-leipzig.de/unigeschichte/professorenkatalog/leipzig/Peschel_940.pdf Universität Leipzig] (biographical sketch)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racial classification==

In 1871 he became a full Professor of the newly established Chair of Geography at the [[University of Leipzig]], he was also a prominent corresponding member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences]]. Peschel is most remembered for his book ''The Races of Man: and their geographical distribution'' (1876) which classifies man into seven races: [[Australoids]], ([[Papuan people|Papuans]]), ([[Melanesians]]), [[Mongoloids]], [[Dravidians]], [[Bushmen]] ([[Capoid race|Capoids]]), [[Negroids]] and [[Mediterranean race|Mediterraneans]] ([[Caucasoids]] - the race itself is divided by Peschel into the Hamite, Semite, and Indo-European families).

'''Petrus Plancius''' (1552 – May 15, 1622) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]]-[[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[astronomer]], [[Cartography|cartographer]]  and [[clergyman]]. He was born as '''Pieter Platevoet''' in [[Dranouter]], now in [[Heuvelland]], [[West Flanders]]. He studied [[theology]] in Germany and England. At the age of 24 he became a [[Religious minister|minister]] in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]].

Because of fear of religious prosecution by the [[Inquisition]] Plancius fled from [[Brussels]] to [[Amsterdam]] after the city fell into Spanish hands in 1585. There he became interested in [[navigation]] and [[cartography]] and, being fortunate enough to have access to nautical charts recently brought from Portugal, he was soon recognized as an expert on the shipping routes to [[India]]. He strongly believed in the idea of a [[Northern Sea Route|North East passage]] until the failure of [[Willem Barentsz]]'s third voyage in 1597 seemed to preclude the possibility of such a route.

For [[History of cartography#Dutch celestial cartography in the Age of Exploration|his pioneering contributions in the history of celestial cartography]], Plancius is considered to be one of the notable figures in the [[Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography|Golden Age of Dutch/Netherlandish cartography]] (c. 1570s–1670s).

==Cartography==
[[File:Petrus Plancius Instructing Students in the Science of Navigation.jpg|thumb|Petrus Plancius Instructing Students in the Science of Navigation, by [[David Vinckboons]]]]
In 1592 Plancius published his best known world map titled "Nova et exacta Terrarum Tabula geographica et hydrographica".&lt;ref&gt;"New and exact geographic and hydrographic map of the world".&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from maps, he published journals and navigational guides and developed a new method for determining [[longitude]]. He also introduced the [[Mercator projection]] for navigational maps.

Plancius was one of the founders of the [[Dutch East India Company]] for which he drew over 100 maps.

Plancius was closely acquainted with [[Henry Hudson]], an explorer of the [[New World]].

Plancius prepared the map, ''Exacta &amp; accurata delinatio… regionibus China, Cauchinchina, Camboja, sive Champa, Syao, Malacca, Arracan &amp; Pegu,'' published in [[Jan Huygen van Linschoten]]’s popular book, ''Itinerario'' (1596).&lt;ref&gt;Leo Bagrow, ''History of Cartography,'' revised and enlarged by R. A. Skelton, London, Watts, 1964, p.265. [http://nla.gov.au/nla.map-rm4335 Exacta &amp; accurata delinatio cum orarum maritimarum tum etiam locorum terrestrium quæ in regionibus China, Cauchinchina, Camboja, sive Champa, Syao, Malacca, Arracan &amp; Pegu] ; Cornelis Koeman, ''Jan Huygen Van Linschoten,'' Coimbra, Universidade de Coimbra Biblioteca Geral 1, 1984, Centro de Estudos de Historia e Cartografia, Vol.153, pp.39-41. Also in ''Revista da Universidade de Coimbra,'' vol.32, 1985, pp.27-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uranography===
In 1589 Plancius collaborated with the Amsterdam cartographer [[Jacob Floris van Langren]] on a 32.5-cm celestial globe, which, using the sparse information available about southern celestial features, for the first time depicted: [[Crux]] the southern cross, [[Triangulum Australe]] the southern triangle, and the [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellanic Clouds]], [[Large Magellanic Cloud|Nubecula Major]] and [[Small Magellanic Cloud|Minor]].

In 1595 Plancius asked [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]], the chief pilot on the ''Hollandia'', to make observations to fill in the blank area around the south celestial pole on European maps of the southern sky. Keyser died in [[Java (island)|Java]] the following year – the expedition had many casualties – but his catalogue of 135 [[star]]s,&lt;ref name="knobel_dehoutman"&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1917MNRAS..77..414K "On Frederick de Houtman's catalogue of southern stars, and the origin of the southern constellations"], by E. B. Knobel, 1917, the catalogue starting at [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1917MNRAS..77..414K&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=7&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;classic=YES page 421]&lt;/ref&gt; probably measured up with the help of explorer-colleague [[Frederick de Houtman]],&lt;ref name="ridpath_ch1_c"&gt;[http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/startales1c.htm "Star Tales ― CHAPTER ONE continued..."] by [[Ian Ridpath]]&lt;/ref&gt; was delivered to Plancius.  These stars appear as 12 new southern [[constellation]]s,&lt;ref name="ridpath_ch1_c"/&gt; on a 35-cm celestial globe designed by Plancius in late 1597 (or early 1598) and produced in collaboration with the Amsterdam cartographer [[Jodocus Hondius|Jodocus Hondius the Elder]]. The 12 new constellations (mostly referring to animals and subjects described in natural history books and travellers' journals of his day) are [[Apis (constellation)|Apis]] the Bee (later changed to [[Musca]] by [[Lacaille]]), [[Apus]] the Bird of Paradise, [[Chamaeleon]], [[Dorado]] the Goldfish (or Swordfish), [[Grus (constellation)|Grus]] the Crane, [[Hydrus]] the Small Water Snake, [[Indus (constellation)|Indus]] the Indian, [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]] the Peacock, [[Phoenix (constellation)|Phoenix]], [[Triangulum Australe]] the Southern Triangle, [[Tucana]] the Toucan, and [[Volans]] the Flying Fish. (The Southern Triangle and Southern Cross were reported as asterisms by earlier navigators and appear on earlier charts,&lt;ref name="Dekker"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dekker |first=Elly |date=1987 |title=Early Explorations of the Southern Celestial Sky |url= |journal=Annals of Science |volume=44 |issue= |pages=439–470 |doi= 10.1080/00033798700200301|access-date= |bibcode = 1987AnSci..44..439D }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the globe of 1598 is the first surviving source that plots their locations reasonably accurately.)  Also notable is the inclusion of Achernar as Alpha Eridani. 

These constellations, together with the constellation [[Columba (constellation)|Columba]] illustrated by Plancius on his large wall map of the world of 1592, were then incorporated in 1603 by [[Johann Bayer]] in his sky atlas, the ''[[Uranometria]]''.

In 1612 (or 1613) Plancius introduced the following eight constellations on a 26.5-cm celestial globe published in Amsterdam by [[Pieter van der Keere]]: [[Musca Borealis|Apes]] the Bee,&lt;ref name="stoppa_plancius"&gt;[http://www.atlascoelestis.com/desu%20Plancius.htm Le costellazioni di Petrus Plancius], on Atlas Coelestis by Felice Stoppa&lt;/ref&gt; [[Camelopardalis]] the Giraffe (often interpreted as a Camel),&lt;ref name="stoppa_plancius"/&gt; [[Cancer Minor]] the Small Crab, [[River Tigris (constellation)|Euphrates Fluvius et Tigris Fluvius]] the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris, [[Gallus (constellation)|Gallus]] the Cock, [[Jordanus (constellation)|Jordanis Fluvius]] the River Jordan, [[Monoceros]] the Unicorn&lt;ref name="stoppa_plancius"/&gt; and [[Sagitta Australis]] the Southern Arrow. Of the latter constellations, only [[Camelopardalis]] and [[Monoceros]] are still found on modern star charts, and recognized by the [[IAU]].&lt;ref name="International Astronomical Union"&gt;[[Astronomical naming conventions#Names and boundaries of constellations]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[minor planet]] 10648 Plancius commemorates his contributions in celestial and terrestrial cartography.

'''Post-glacial rebound''' (also called '''isostatic rebound''' or '''crustal rebound''') is the rise of land masses after the lifting of the huge weight of [[ice sheet]]s during the [[last glacial period]], which had caused [[isostatic depression]]. Post-glacial rebound and isostatic depression are phases of '''glacial isostasy''' ('''glacial isostatic adjustment''', '''glacioisostasy'''), the  deformation of the Earth's crust in response to changes in ice mass distribution.&lt;ref name="MilneOthers2013a"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Milne|first1=G.|last2=Shennan|first2=I.|title=Isostasy: Glaciation-Induced Sea-Level Change|editor1-last=Elias |editor1-first=Scott A.  |editor2-last=Mock |editor2-first=Cary J.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Quaternary Science|volume=3|year=2013|edition=2nd|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-53643-3.00135-7|publisher=Elsevier|pages=452-459 |isbn=978-0-444-53643-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The direct raising effects of post-glacial rebound are readily apparent in parts of Northern [[Eurasia]], [[Northern America]], [[Patagonia]], and [[Antarctica]]. However, through the processes of ''ocean siphoning'' and ''continental levering'', the effects of post-glacial rebound on [[sea level]] are felt globally far from the locations of current and former ice sheets.&lt;ref name="MilneOthers2008a"&gt;Milne, G.A., and J.X. Mitrovica (2008) ''Searching for eustasy in deglacial sea-level histories.'' Quaternary Science Reviews. 27:2292–2302.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Image:Diagram showing historical levels of Lake Superior.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Changes in the elevation of [[Lake Superior]] due to glaciation and post-glacial rebound]]
During the [[last glacial period]], much of [[northern Europe]], [[Asia]], [[North America]], [[Greenland]] and [[Antarctica]] was covered by [[ice sheet]]s, which reached up to three kilometres thick during the [[last glacial maximum|glacial maximum]] about 20,000 years ago.  The enormous weight of this ice caused the surface of the [[Earth]]'s [[Crust (geology)|crust]] to deform and warp downward, forcing the [[viscoelastic]] [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] material to flow away from the loaded region.  At the end of each [[glacial period]] when the [[glacier]]s retreated, the removal of this weight led to slow (and still ongoing) uplift or rebound of the land and the return flow of mantle material back under the [[deglaciation|deglaciated]] area.  Due to the extreme [[viscosity]] of the mantle, it will take many thousands of years for the land to reach an [[Hydrostatic equilibrium|equilibrium]] level.

The uplift has taken place in two distinct stages.  The initial uplift following deglaciation was almost immediate due to the [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] response of the crust as the ice load was removed.  After this elastic phase, uplift proceeded by slow viscous flow at an [[exponential decay|exponentially]] decreasing rate.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Today, typical uplift rates are of the order of 1&amp;nbsp;cm/year or less. In northern Europe, this is clearly shown by the [[GPS]] data obtained by the BIFROST GPS network.&lt;ref name="johansson-2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johansson |first=J.M. |display-authors=etal |date=2002 |title=Continuous GPS measurements of postglacial adjustment in Fennoscandia. 1.

The total uplift from the end of deglaciation depends on the local ice load and could be several hundred metres near the centre of rebound.

Recently, the term "post-glacial rebound" is gradually being replaced by the term "glacial isostatic adjustment". This is in recognition that the response of the Earth to glacial loading and unloading is not limited to the upward rebound movement, but also involves downward land movement, horizontal crustal motion,&lt;ref name="johansson-2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sella-etal-2007"&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=4 |last=Sella |first=G.F. |author2=Stein, S. |author3=Dixon, T.H. |author4=Craymer, M. |author5=James, T.S. |author6=Mazzotti, S. |author7=Dokka, R.K.  |date=2007 |title=Observation of glacial isostatic adjustment in "stable" North America with GPS |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=34 |pages=L02306 |doi=10.1029/2006GL027081 |bibcode=2007GeoRL..3402306S |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; changes in global sea levels&lt;ref name="peltier-1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peltier |first=W.R. |author-link=William Richard Peltier|date=1998 |title=Postglacial variations in the level of the sea: implications for climate dynamics and solid-earth geophysics |journal=Reviews of Geophysics |volume=36 |pages=603–689 |doi=10.1029/98RG02638 |bibcode=1998RvGeo..36..603P |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Earth's gravity field,&lt;ref name="mitrovica-peltier-1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mitrovica |first=J.X. |author2=W.R.

Unfortunately, that term gives the wrong impression that isostatic equilibrium is somehow reached, so by appending "adjustment" at the end, the motion of restoration is emphasized.

==Effects==
Post-glacial rebound produces measurable effects on vertical crustal motion, global sea levels, horizontal crustal motion, gravity field, Earth's rotation, crustal stress, and earthquakes. Studies of glacial rebound give us information about the flow law of mantle rocks, which is important to the study of mantle convection, [[plate tectonics]] and the thermal evolution of the Earth.  It also gives insight into past ice sheet history, which is important to [[glaciology]], [[paleoclimate]], and changes in global sea level. Understanding postglacial rebound is also important to our ability to monitor recent global change.

===Vertical crustal motion===
[[Image:Suomi jaakauden jalkeen.png|thumb|200px|Much of modern [[Finland]] is former seabed or archipelago: illustrated are sea levels immediately after the last ice age.]]
Erratic [[boulder]]s, [[U-shaped valley]]s, [[drumlin]]s, [[esker]]s, [[kettle lake]]s, [[bedrock]] [[Glacial striation|striation]]s are among the common signatures of the [[Ice Age]]. In addition, post-glacial rebound has caused numerous significant changes to coastlines and landscapes over the last several thousand years, and the effects continue to be significant.

In [[Sweden]], Lake [[Mälaren]] was formerly an arm of the [[Baltic Sea]], but uplift eventually cut it off and led to its becoming a [[freshwater]] [[lake]] in about the 12th century, at the time when [[Stockholm]] was founded at [[Slussen|its outlet]]. Marine seashells found in [[Lake Ontario]] sediments imply a similar event in prehistoric times. Other pronounced effects can be seen on the island of [[Öland]], Sweden, which has little topographic relief due to the presence of the very level [[Stora Alvaret]].  The rising land has caused the [[Iron Age]] settlement area to recede from the [[Baltic Sea]], making the present day villages on the west coast set back unexpectedly far from the shore.  These effects are quite dramatic at the village of [[Alby, Öland|Alby]], for example, where the [[Iron Age]] inhabitants were known to subsist on substantial coastal fishing.

As a result of post-glacial rebound, the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] is predicted to eventually close up at [[Kvarken]] in more than 2,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tikkanen |first1=Matti |last2=Oksanen |first2=Juha |date=2002 |title=Late Weichselian and Holocene shore displacement history of the Baltic Sea in Finland |url=http://www.helsinki.fi/maantiede/geofi/fennia/demo/pages/oksanen.htm |journal=[[Fennia (journal)|Fennia]] |volume=180 |issue=1–2 |pages= |doi= |access-date=December 22, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020130214/http://www.helsinki.fi/maantiede/geofi/fennia/demo/pages/oksanen.htm |archivedate=October 20, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kvarken]] is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Natural Heritage Site]], selected as a "type area" illustrating the effects of post-glacial rebound and the [[holocene glacial retreat]].

In several other [[Nordic Countries|Nordic]] ports, like [[Tornio]] and [[Pori]] (formerly at [[Ulvila]]), the harbour has had to be relocated several times. Place names in the coastal regions also illustrate the rising land: there are inland places named 'island', 'skerry', 'rock', 'point' and 'sound'. For example, [[Oulunsalo]] "island of [[Oulujoki]]"&lt;ref name="ouloujoki"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kaino.kotus.fi/www/verkkojulkaisut/julk125/oulunsalo/ |title=Oulunsalon kirkon seudun paikannimistö |language=Finnish |accessdate=2008-05-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221110053/http://kaino.kotus.fi/www/verkkojulkaisut/julk125/oulunsalo/ |archivedate=2008-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a peninsula, with inland names such as ''Koivukari'' "Birch Rock", ''Santaniemi'' "Sandy Cape", and ''Salmioja'' "the brook of the Sound". (Compare  [http://kaino.kotus.fi/www/verkkojulkaisut/julk125/oulunsalo/oulunsalo_ennen.shtml] and [http://kaino.kotus.fi/www/verkkojulkaisut/julk125/oulunsalo/oulunsalo_nyt.shtml].)
[[Image:Post-glacial rebound in British Isles.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Map of Post Glacial Rebound effects upon the land-level on the [[British Isles]].]]
In [[Great Britain]], glaciation affected [[Scotland]] but not southern [[England]], and the post-glacial rebound of northern Great Britain (up to 10&amp;nbsp;cm per century) is causing a corresponding downward movement of the southern half of the island (up to 5&amp;nbsp;cm per century). This will eventually lead to an increased risk of [[flood]]s in southern England and south-western Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Gray| first =Louise| title =England is sinking while Scotland rises above sea levels, according to new study| newspaper =Telegraph| date =7 October 2009| url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/6226537/England-is-sinking-while-Scotland-rises-above-sea-levels-according-to-new-study.html| accessdate =10 April 2012| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120617102426/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/6226537/England-is-sinking-while-Scotland-rises-above-sea-levels-according-to-new-study.html| archivedate =17 June 2012| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the glacial isostatic adjustment process causes the land to move relative to the sea, ancient shorelines are found to lie above present day sea level in areas that were once glaciated. On the other hand, places in the peripheral bulge area which was uplifted during glaciation now begins to subside. Therefore, ancient beaches are found below present day sea level in the bulge area. The "relative sea level data", which consists of height and age measurements of the ancient beaches around the world,  tells us that glacial isostatic adjustment proceeded at a higher rate near the end of deglaciation than today.

The present-day uplift motion in northern Europe is also monitored by a [[GPS]] network called BIFROST.&lt;ref name="johansson-2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bifrost-harvard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/space_geodesy/BIFROST/radial_rates.html |title=Observed Radial Rates from GPS |work=BIFROST Associated GPS Networks |accessdate=2008-05-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67LIZE7mP?url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/space_geodesy/BIFROST/radial_rates.html |archivedate=2012-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bifrost"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oso.chalmers.se/%7Ehgs/Bifrost_01/ |title=BIFROST |accessdate=2008-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67LIZiRER?url=http://froste.oso.chalmers.se/hgs//Bifrost_01/ |archivedate=2012-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results of GPS data show a peak rate of about 11&amp;nbsp;mm/year in the north part of the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], but this uplift rate decreases away and becomes negative outside the former ice margin.

In the near field outside the former ice margin, the land sinks relative to the sea. This is the case along the east coast of the United States, where ancient beaches are found submerged below present day sea level and Florida is expected to be submerged in the future.&lt;ref name="peltier-1998" /&gt; GPS data in North America also confirms that land uplift becomes subsidence outside the former ice margin.&lt;ref name="sella-etal-2007" /&gt;

===Global sea levels===
To form the ice sheets of the last Ice Age, water from the oceans evaporated, condensed as snow and was deposited as ice in high latitudes. Thus global sea level fell during glaciation.

The ice sheets at the last [[glacial maximum]] were so massive that global sea level fell by about 120 metres. Thus continental shelves were exposed and many islands became connected with the continents through dry land. This was the case between the British Isles and Europe ([[Doggerland]]), or between Taiwan, the Indonesian islands and Asia ([[Sundaland]]). A [[Beringia|sub-continent also existed between Siberia and Alaska]] that allowed the migration of people and animals during the last glacial maximum.&lt;ref name="peltier-1998" /&gt;

The fall in sea level also affects the circulation of ocean currents and thus has important impact on climate during the glacial maximum.

During deglaciation, the melted ice water returns to the oceans, thus [[sea level rise|sea level in the ocean increases]] again. However, geological records of sea level changes show that the redistribution of the melted ice water is not the same everywhere in the oceans. In other words, depending upon the location, the rise in sea level at a certain site may be more than that at another site. This is due to the gravitational attraction between the mass of the melted water and the other masses, such as remaining ice sheets, glaciers, water masses and mantle rocks&lt;ref name="peltier-1998" /&gt; and the changes in centrifugal potential due to Earth's variable rotation.&lt;ref name="mitrovica-milne-davis-2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mitrovica |first=J.X. |author2=G.A. Milne |author3=J.L. Davis |last-author-amp=yes |date=2001 |title=Glacial isostatic adjustment on a rotating earth |journal=[[Geophysical Journal International]] |volume=147 |pages=562–578 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-246x.2001.01550.x |issue=3|bibcode = 2001GeoJI.147..562M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horizontal crustal motion===

Accompanying vertical motion is the horizontal motion of the crust. The BIFROST GPS network&lt;ref name="bifrost" /&gt; shows that the motion diverges from the centre of rebound.&lt;ref name="johansson-2002" /&gt; However, the largest horizontal velocity is found near the former ice margin.

The situation in North America is less certain; this is due to the sparse distribution of GPS stations in northern Canada, which is rather inaccessible.&lt;ref name="sella-etal-2007" /&gt;

===Tilt===
The combination of horizontal and vertical motion changes the tilt of the surface. That is, locations farther north rise faster, an effect that becomes apparent in lakes. The bottoms of the lakes gradually tilt away from the direction of the former ice maximum, such that lake shores on the side of the maximum (typically north) recede and the opposite (southern) shores sink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seppä, H. |author2=M. Tikkanen &amp;amp; J.-P. Mäkiaho |title=Tilting of Lake Pielinen, eastern Finland – an example of extreme transgressions and regressions caused by differential post-glacial isostatic uplift |journal=Estonian Journal of Earth Sciences |volume=61 |issue=3 |date=2012 |pages=149–161 |doi=10.3176/earth.2012.3.02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes the formation of new rapids and rivers. For example, [[Lake Pielinen]], which is large (90 x 30&amp;nbsp;km) and oriented perpendicularly to the former ice margin, originally drained through an outlet in the middle of the lake near Nunnanlahti to Lake [[Höytiäinen]]. The change of tilt caused Pielinen to burst through the Uimaharju [[esker]] at the southwestern end of the lake, creating a new river ([[Pielisjoki]]) that runs to the sea via [[Lake Pyhäselkä]] to [[Lake Saimaa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joensuu.fi/jaakausi-paattyy-pielinen-syntyy|title=Jääkausi päättyy, Pielinen syntyy - joensuu.fi|author=|date=|website=www.joensuu.fi|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630235015/http://www.joensuu.fi/jaakausi-paattyy-pielinen-syntyy|archivedate=30 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects are similar to that concerning seashores, but occur above sea level. Tilting of land will also affect the flow of water in lakes and rivers in the future, and thus important for water resource management planning.

===Gravity field===
Ice, water and mantle rocks have [[mass]], and as they move around, they exert a gravitational pull on other masses towards them. Thus, the [[gravity field]], which is sensitive to all mass on the surface and within the Earth, is affected by the redistribution of ice/melted water on the surface of the Earth and the flow of mantle rocks within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/12/ice-sheet-in-peril-gravity-to-rescue/|title=Ice sheet in peril? Gravity to the rescue|author=|date=2 December 2010|website=harvard.edu|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814213410/http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/12/ice-sheet-in-peril-gravity-to-rescue/|archivedate=14 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, more than 6000 years after the last deglaciation terminated, the flow of [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] material back to the glaciated area causes the overall shape of the Earth to become less [[oblate spheroid|oblate]]. This change in the topography of Earth's surface affects the long-wavelength components of the gravity field. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

The changing gravity field can be detected by repeated land measurements with absolute gravimeters and recently by the [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]] satellite mission.&lt;ref name="grace"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/pb1/op/grace/index_GRACE.html |title=GFZ Potsdam, Department 1: The GRACE Mission |accessdate=2008-05-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080508081548/http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/pb1/op/grace/index_GRACE.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The change in long-wavelength components of Earth's gravity field also perturbs the orbital motion of satellites and has been detected by [[LAGEOS]] satellite motion.&lt;ref name="yoder-etal-1983"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yoder |first=C.

===Vertical datum===
The vertical [[Datum (geodesy)|datum]] is a theoretical reference surface for altitude measurement and plays vital roles in many human activities, including land surveying and construction of buildings and bridges.  Since postglacial rebound continuously deforms the crustal surface and the gravitational field, the vertical datum needs to be redefined repeatedly through time.

===State of stress, intraplate earthquakes and volcanism===
According to the theory of [[plate tectonics]], plate-plate interaction results in earthquakes near plate boundaries. However, large earthquakes are found in intraplate environment like eastern Canada (up to M7) and northern Europe (up to M5) which are far away from present-day plate boundaries. An important intraplate earthquake was the magnitude 8 [[1812 New Madrid earthquake|New Madrid earthquake]] that occurred in mid-continental US in the year 1811.

Glacial loads provided more than 30 MPa of vertical stress in northern Canada and more than 20 MPa in northern Europe during glacial maximum. This vertical stress is supported by the mantle and the flexure of the [[lithosphere]]. Since the mantle and the lithosphere continuously respond to the changing ice and water loads, the state of stress at any location continuously changes in time. The changes in the orientation of the state of stress is recorded in the [[postglacial faults]] in southeastern Canada.&lt;ref name="wu-1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wu |first=P. |date=1996 |title=Changes in orientation of near-surface stress field as constraints to mantle viscosity and horizontal stress differences in Eastern Canada |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=23 |pages=2263–2266 |doi=10.1029/96GL02149 |bibcode=1996GeoRL..23.2263W |issue=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the postglacial faults formed at the end of deglaciation 9000 years ago, the horizontal principal stress orientation was almost perpendicular to the former ice margin, but today the orientation is in the northeast-southwest, along the direction of [[seafloor spreading]] at the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]. This shows that the stress due to postglacial rebound had played an important role at deglacial time, but has gradually relaxed so that tectonic stress has become more dominant today.

According to the [[Mohr–Coulomb theory]] of  rock failure, large glacial loads generally suppress earthquakes, but  rapid deglaciation promotes earthquakes. According to Wu &amp; Hasagawa, the rebound stress that is available to trigger earthquakes today is of the order of 1 MPa.&lt;ref name="wu-hasagawa-1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wu |first=P. |author2=H.S. Hasegawa |date=1996 |title=Induced stresses and fault potential in Eastern Canada due to a realistic load: a preliminary analysis |journal=Geophysical Journal International |volume=127 |pages=215–229 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-246X.1996.tb01546.x|bibcode = 1996GeoJI.127..215W }}&lt;/ref&gt; This stress level is not large enough to rupture intact rocks but is large enough to reactivate pre-existing faults that are close to failure. Thus, both postglacial rebound and past tectonics play important roles in today's intraplate earthquakes in eastern Canada and southeast US.  Generally postglacial rebound stress could have triggered the intraplate earthquakes in eastern Canada and may have played some role in triggering earthquakes in the eastern US including the [[1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes|New Madrid earthquakes of 1811]].&lt;ref name="wu-johnston-2000" /&gt; The situation in northern Europe today is complicated by the current tectonic activities nearby and by coastal loading and weakening.

Increasing pressure due to the weight of the ice during glaciation may have suppressed melt generation and volcanic activities below Iceland and Greenland. On the other hand, decreasing pressure due to deglaciation can increase the melt production and volcanic activities by 20-30 times.&lt;ref name="Jull-McKenzie-1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jull |first=M. |author2=D.

===Recent global warming===
Recent [[global warming]] has caused mountain glaciers and the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to melt and global sea level to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/warming-seas-and-melting-ice-sheets|title=Warming Seas, Melting Ice Sheets|first=Rob|last=Garner|date=25 August 2015|website=nasa.gov|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420173603/https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/warming-seas-and-melting-ice-sheets/|archivedate=20 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, monitoring [[sea level rise]] and the mass balance of ice sheets and glaciers allows people to understand more about global warming.

Recent rise in sea levels has been monitored by tide gauges and satellite altimetry (e.g. [[TOPEX/Poseidon]]).  As well as the addition of melted ice water from glaciers and ice sheets, recent sea level changes are affected by the thermal expansion of sea water due to global warming&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/411.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831084509/https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/411.htm |archivedate=2017-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, sea level change due to deglaciation of the last glacial maximum (postglacial sea level change), deformation of the land and ocean floor and other factors.  Thus, to understand global warming from sea level change, one must be able to separate all these factors, especially postglacial rebound, since it is one of the leading factors.

Mass changes of  ice sheets can be monitored by measuring changes in the ice surface height, the deformation of the ground below and the changes in the gravity field over the ice sheet. Thus [[ICESat]], [[GPS]] and [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]] satellite mission are useful for such purpose.&lt;ref name="wahr-wingham-bentley-2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wahr |first=J. |author2=D. Wingham |author3=C. Bentley |last-author-amp=yes |date=2000 |title=A method of combining ICESat and GRACE satellite data to constrain Antarctic mass balance |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=105 |issue=B7 |pages=16279–16294 |doi=10.1029/2000JB900113 |bibcode=2000JGR...10516279W}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, glacial isostatic adjustment of the ice sheets affect ground deformation and the gravity field today. Thus understanding glacial isostatic adjustment is important in monitoring recent global warming.

One of the possible impacts of global warming-triggered rebound may be more volcanic activity in previously ice-capped areas such as Iceland and Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/environment/|title=Environment|author=|date=30 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323150919/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/environment/|archivedate=23 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also trigger intraplate earthquakes near the ice margins of Greenland and Antarctica.

==Applications==
The speed and amount of postglacial rebound is determined by two factors: the [[viscosity]] or [[rheology]] (i.e., the flow) of the mantle, and the ice loading and unloading histories on the surface of Earth.

The viscosity of the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] is important in understanding [[mantle convection]], [[plate tectonics]], dynamical processes in Earth, the thermal state and thermal evolution of Earth. However viscosity is difficult to observe because creep experiments of mantle rocks take thousands of years to observe and the ambient temperature and pressure conditions are not easy to attain for a long enough time. Thus, the observations of postglacial rebound provide a natural experiment to measure mantle rheology. Modelling of glacial isostatic adjustment addresses the question of how viscosity changes in the radial&lt;ref name="peltier-1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vermeersen-etal-1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vermeersen |first=L.L.A. |display-authors=etal |date=1998 |title=Mantle viscosity inferences from joint inversion of Pleistocene deglaciation-induced changes in geopotential with a new SLR analysis and Polar Wander |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=25 |issue=23 |pages=4261–4264 |doi=10.1029/1998GL900150 |bibcode=1998GeoRL..25.4261V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kaufmann-lambeck-2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaufmann |first=G. |author2=K.

Ice thickness histories are useful in the study of [[paleoclimatology]], [[glaciology]] and paleo-oceanography. Ice thickness histories are traditionally deduced from the three types of information: First, the sea level data at stable sites far away from the centers of [[deglaciation]] give an estimate of how much water entered the oceans or equivalently how much ice was locked up at glacial maximum. Secondly, the location and dates of [[Terminal Moraines|terminal moraines]] tell us the areal extent and retreat of past ice sheets. Physics of glaciers gives us the theoretical profile of ice sheets at equilibrium, it also says that the thickness and horizontal extent of [[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] ice sheets are closely related to the basal condition of the ice sheets. Thus the volume of ice locked up is proportional to their instantaneous area. Finally, the heights of ancient beaches in the sea level data and observed land uplift rates (e.g. from [[GPS]] or [[VLBI]]) can be used to [[Constraint (mathematics)|constrain]] local ice thickness. A popular ice model deduced this way is the ICE5G model.&lt;ref name="peltier-2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peltier |first=W. R. |date=2004 |title=Global glacial isostasy and the surface of the ice age earth: the ICE-5G (VM2) Model and GRACE |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume=32 |pages=111–149 |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.32.082503.144359 |bibcode=2004AREPS..32..111P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the response of the Earth to changes in ice height is slow, it cannot record rapid fluctuation or surges of ice sheets, thus the ice sheet profiles deduced this way only gives the "average height" over a thousand years or so.&lt;ref name="hughes-1998"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hughes |first=T.|date=1998 |contribution=Tutorial on Strategies for using isostatic adjustments in models that reconstruct ice sheets during the last deglaciation |title=Dynamics of the Ice Age Earth: A Modern Perspective |editor-last=Wu |editor-first=P. |publisher=Trans Tech Publ. |location=Switzerland |pages=271–322 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glacial [[Isostasy|isostatic]] adjustment also plays an important role in understanding recent global warming and climate change.

==Discovery==
Before the eighteenth century, it was thought, in [[Sweden]], that sea levels were falling.  On the initiative of [[Anders Celsius]] a number of marks were made in rock on different locations along the Swedish coast.  In 1765 it was possible to conclude that it was not a lowering of sea levels but an uneven rise of land.  In 1865 [[Thomas Jamieson]] came up with a theory that the rise of land was connected with the ice age that had been first discovered in 1837.  The theory was accepted after investigations by [[Gerard De Geer]] of old shorelines in Scandinavia published in 1890&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=De Geer |first1=Gerard |title=Om Skandinaviens nivåförändringar under qvartärperioden |journal=Geologiska Föreningen i Stockholm Förhandlingar |date=1890 |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=366–379 |doi=10.1080/11035898809444216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Geer |first1=Gerard |title=Quaternary Sen-bottoms in Western Sweden |journal=Geologiska Föreningen i Stockholm Förhandlingar |date=1910 |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=1139–1195 |doi=10.1080/11035891009442325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=De Geer |first1=Gerard |title=Post-Algonkian Oscillations of Land in Feunoscandia |journal=Geologiska Föreningen i Stockholm Förhandlingar |date=1924 |volume=46 |issue=3-4 |pages=316–324 |doi=10.1080/11035892409442370}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Legal implications==
In areas where the rising of land is seen, it is necessary to define the exact limits of property. In Finland, the "new land" is legally the property of the owner of the water area, not any land owners on the shore. Therefore, if the owner of the land wishes to build a pier over the "new land", they need the permission of the owner of the (former) water area. The landowner of the shore may redeem the new land at market price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vintti.yle.fi/yle.fi/kodinkaantopiiri/vesijatto.htm|title=Alluvion comes as a surprise| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716075322/http://yle.fi/kodinkaantopiiri/vesijatto.htm| archivedate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the owner of the water area is the [[partition unit]] of the landowners of the shores, a collective holding corporation.

A '''principal meridian''' is a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] used for survey control in a large region.

==Canada==
The [[Dominion Land Survey]] of [[Western Canada]] took its origin at the First (or Principal) Meridian, located at 97°27′28.41″ west of [[Prime Meridian|Greenwich]], just west of [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]. This line is exactly ten miles west of the Red River at the Canada-United States border.

Six other meridians were designated at four-degree intervals westward, with the seventh located in British Columbia; the second and fourth meridians form the general eastern border and the western border of [[Saskatchewan]].

==United States==
[[File:Meridians-baselines.png|thumb|300px|right|This [[Bureau of Land Management|BLM]] map depicts the principal meridians and [[baseline (surveying)|baselines]] used for surveying states (colored) in the PLSS.]]
In the [[United States]] [[Public Land Survey System]], a principal meridian is the principal north-south line used for survey control in a large region, and which  divides townships between east and west. The meridian meets its corresponding [[baseline (surveying)|baseline]] at the point of origin, or [[initial point]], for the land survey. For example, the [[Mount Diablo Meridian]], used for surveys in California and Nevada, runs north-south through the summit of [[Mount Diablo State Park|Mount Diablo]].

Often, meridians are marked with roads, such as the Meridian Avenue in [[San Jose, California]], Meridian Road in [[Vacaville, California]], both on the [[Mount Diablo Meridian]], Meridian Road in [[Wichita, Kansas]] on the Sixth Principal Meridian, and Meridian Avenue in several western Washington counties generally following the Willamette Meridian.  Baseline Road or Base Line Street extends for about 40 miles from [[Highland, California]] east of San Bernardino to [[La Verne, California]] where it meets Foothill Boulevard.

The '''Republic of Salé''' was a short-lived [[city state]] at [[Salé]] (modern Morocco), during the 17th Century. Located at the mouth of the [[Bou Regreg]] river, it was founded by [[Moriscos]] from the town of [[Hornachos]], in Western Spain. Moriscos were the descendants of Muslims who were nominally converted to Christianity, and were subject to mass deportation during the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. The Republic's main commercial activities were the [[Barbary slave trade]] and [[Barbary pirates|piracy]]&lt;ref name="Maz_2009" /&gt; during its brief existence in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="JayyusiHolod2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saïd Mouline|editor=Salma K.

==History==
[[File:Bu Regrego ziotys.jpg|thumb|left|The ancient harbor at the Bou Regreg, taken from Salé facing Rabat]]

===Arrival of the Moriscos ===

The republic traces its origins back to the beginning of the 17th century, with the arrival of approximately 3,000 wealthy [[Moriscos]] from [[Hornachos]] in western Spain, who anticipated the 1609 [[Expulsion of the Moriscos|expulsion edicts]] ordered by [[Philip III of Spain]].&lt;ref name="Coindreau_42"&gt;Coindreau 2006, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; After 1609, approximately 10,000 down-and-out expelled Moriscos arrived from [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="Coindreau_43"&gt;Coindreau 2006, p.43&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural and language differences between the native Saletin people and the Morisco refugees  led the newcomers to settle in the old Medina of Rabat, on the opposite bank of the [[Bou Regreg]].&lt;ref name="Maziane2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leïla Maziane|title=Salé et ses corsaires, 1666-1727|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yhuv9waKc_MC&amp;pg=PA69|year=2008|publisher=Publication Univ Rouen Havre|language=French|isbn=978-2-87775-832-1|pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maz_2009" /&gt;

Pirates based on the western bank thrived and expanded their operations throughout the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.lemonde.fr/voyage/article/2009/09/01/rabat-sale-la-conquete-pirate_1339693_3546.html « Rabat/Salé, la conquête pirate »], in ''Le Monde'', September 1st, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1624, the Dutchman [[Jan Janszoon]] (also known as Murad Reis) became the "Grand Admiral" and President of the Corsair Republic of Salé.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SJEg0p4RCP4C&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=republic+of+sale,+morocco#v=onepage&amp;q=murad%20reis&amp;f=false "Murad Reis"], Pirate Utopias, p. 97, Retrieved 30 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence===
After Janszoon left Salé in 1627, the Moriscos ceased to recognize the authority of the Sultan [[Zidan al-Nasir]], and refused to pay his [[tithe]] on their incomes.&lt;ref name="Maziane_2007_59"&gt;Maziane 2007, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; They proclaimed a Republic, ruled by a council or ''[[Divan|Diwan]]'', a sort of government cabinet formed by 12 to 14 notable people whose members annually elected a Governor and a ''Captain General of the Fortalesa'' during the month of May. In the early years of the republic (between 1627 and 1630), the ''Diwan'' was controlled only by Hornacheros, whose grip on power was resented by the growing population of non-Hornachero Moriscos, called Andalusians.&lt;ref name="Coindreau_48"&gt;Coindreau 2006, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; After bloody clashes in 1630, an agreement was reached: the election of a  ''[[Qaid]]'' by Andalusians and a new ''Diwan'' of 16 members of whom 8 Andalusians and 8 Hornacheros.&lt;ref name="Coindreau_44_50"&gt;Coindreau 2006, p.44-45 &amp; 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1641 the [[Zaouia of Dila]], which controlled much of Morocco, imposed a religious hegemony over Salé and its parent republic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zk9kfnoFHfEC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=republic+of+sale,+morocco#v=onepage&amp;q=republic%20of%20sale%2C%20morocco&amp;f=false "Class/social stratification in Islam"], History and underdevelopment in Morocco, p. 43, Retrieved 30 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1660s the republic was embroiled in civil war with the zawiya, and eventually Sultan [[Al-Rashid of Morocco]] of the [[Alaouite dynasty]], which still rules Morocco into the 21st century, seized Rabat and Salé, ending its independence. It ended up under the control of the Sultan of Morocco after 1668, when [[Al-Rashid of Morocco|Moulay al Rashid]] finally vanquished the Dilaites.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Coindreau, 2006, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Hartshorne''' (December 12, 1899 – November 5, 1992) was a prominent [[United States|American]] [[geographer]], and professor at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], who specialized in [[economic geography|economic]] and [[political geography]] and the [[philosophy of geography]]. He is known in particular for his methodological work ''The Nature of Geography'', published in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times Obituary, "Richard Hartshorne; Geographer Was 92", November 10, 1992, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3D81E31F933A25752C1A964958260 Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania]], Hartshorne completed his undergraduate studies at [[Princeton University]] in 1920, and his doctorate at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1924

Hartshorne taught at the [[University of Minnesota]] from 1924 to 1940, and at the University of Wisconsin-Madison from 1945 to 1970. In the war-time interruption from 1941 to 1945 he established and ran the Geography Division in the branch of Research and Analysis of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS).&lt;ref&gt;McMaster, Robert and McMaster, Susanna, "A History of Twentieth-Century American Academic Cartography" in ''Cartography and Geographic Information Science'', v.29, n. 3, July, 2002, American Congress on Surveying and Mapping, Gaithersburg, MD. [http://www.geography.wisc.edu/histcart/v6initiative/13mcmaster.pdf U of Wisconsin PDF Eprint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020030502/http://www.geography.wisc.edu/histcart/v6initiative/13mcmaster.pdf |date=2006-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartshorne was president of the [[Association of American Geographers]] in 1949. The association gave him its top award in 1960. He was also awarded a Doctor of Laws (''honoris causa'') from Clark University, April 17, 1971, and the [[Victoria Medal (geography)|Victoria medal]] from the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1984.

He died of cancer at his home in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Geoffrey J., "In Memoriam: Richard Hartshorne, 1899-1992", ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', Vol. 84, No. 3 (Sep., 1994), pp. 480-492, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2563779 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Among his brothers was the prominent American philosopher [[Charles Hartshorne]].

== Work ==
Hartshorne's 1939 book ''The Nature of Geography: A Critical Survey of Current Thought in the Light of the Past'', reflected his concern that geographers, as scientists and scholars, should familiarize themselves with, and take account of, past work in their field. The book itself became a standard in the field and remained in print for decades; the seventh edition was published in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/geography/giw/hartshorne-r/1939_ng/naturehome.html Eprint] of Editor's Forward and Chapters 1, 2, 11, and 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s Hartshorne was part of a key geographical debate over the nature of the subject. [[Fred K. Schaefer]] called for the adoption of the 'scientific method' and study of spatial laws and criticised the 'old method' promoted by Hartshorne as the 'Hartshornian orthodoxy'.

His 1970 book ''The Academic Citizen: Selected Statements by Richard Hartshorne'' with introduction and notes by Mark Hoyt Ingraham,&lt;ref&gt;"Mark H. Ingraham, emeritus professor of mathematics, long time dean of the College of Letters and Science, and former national president of the [[American Association of University Professors|AAUP]]...." — page vi of the preface.&lt;/ref&gt; contains various statements on academic issues, authored (in some cases, co-authored) by Hartshorne, from the late 1940s through the 1960s, his pre-emeritus years at the University of Wisconsin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4439">'''River channel migration''' is the geomorphological process that involves the lateral migration of an [[alluvial]] [[channel (geography)|river channel]] across its [[floodplain]]. This process is mainly driven by the combination of [[bank erosion]] of and [[point bar]] deposition over time. When referring to river channel migration, it is typically in reference to [[meander|meandering streams]]. In [[braided stream]]s, channel change is driven by [[sediment transport]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bierman, Paul R., and David R. Montgomery. ''Key Concepts in Geomorphology''. New York: W.H. Freeman, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical Processes ==

=== Bank Erosion ===
As flow enters the bank of an [[alluvial river]], the centrifugal force created by the bend instigates [[helicoidal flow]], a corkscrew like pattern of flow, which drives the [[hydraulic action]] acting on the opposing bank.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is where the primary process in river channel migration of [[bank erosion]] occurs. Often the bank is undercut, another result of the helicoidal flow, which leads to the creation of cut banks. Factors that limit the rate of bank erosion include the rate of deposition of the point bar, [[stream power]], and the critical [[shear stress]] of the stream bed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Howard, Alan D. "Modeling channel migration and floodplain sedimentation in meandering streams." ''Lowland floodplain rivers: geomorphological perspectives''(1992): 1-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Point Bar Deposition ===
The sediment taken from the bank during the process of [[bank erosion]] is deposited on the opposing side of the channel fueling the process called point bar deposition. The [[helicoidal flow]] also plays a role in this process by acting as a cross channel component that moves the sediment to the other side.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The processes of point bar deposition and bank erosion are intertwined and in most cases the erosion rate of cut banks is equal to the deposition rate of point bars.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, point bars act as topographic obstructions once formed that further drive flow into the opposite bank, creating a [[Positive feedback|positive feedback loop]]. This leads to the meanders of an alluvial river becoming more well defined over time.

== Characteristic Features ==
Typical features found in river channel migration are [[point bar]]s, [[cut bank]]s, [[meander]]s, [[floodplain]]s, and [[oxbow lake]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Measurement And Modeling ==
Techniques used for measuring river channel migration vary among different time scales. Over long time scales, sedimentological evidence, botanical evidence, and historical sources are utilized. Over intermediate time scales, planimetric resurveying and repeated cross profiting are utilized. Over short time scales, terrestrial photogrammetry and erosion pins are utilized.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawler|first1=D. M.|title=The measurement of river bank erosion and lateral channel change: A review|journal=[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]|date=1993|volume=18|issue=9|pages=777–821|doi=10.1002/esp.3290180905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to model river channel migrations over time, [[orthogonal functions]] of erosion path lines can be generated for individual point bar complexes. The orthogonal functions can be used to directly indicate the paths that channels could take in lateral migrations. The modeling of meander patterns can be useful in a variety of physical applications.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hickin|first1=E. J.|title=The development of meanders in natural river-channels|journal=American Journal of Science|date=1974|volume=274|issue=4|pages=414–442|doi=10.2475/ajs.274.4.414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Superbia''' was a mobile city-state in [[DC Comics]] continuity. It initially floated above the radioactive ruins of [[Montevideo, Uruguay]], which was destroyed by a villain called [[Vandal Savage]]. For several years, it is the home of the [[Ultramarine Corps]], superheroes who were started by the corrupt [[United States]] military officer [[General Wade Eiling]]. After recovering from Eiling's manipulations, the Corp struck out on their own in concert with former members of the [[Global Guardians]] and any other heroes who wished to join them.

The city was subsequently destroyed in [[Africa]] during the course of a takeover by [[Gorilla Grodd]], [[Nebula Man]] and elements of the [[Sheeda]]. It crashed into the already ravaged city [[Kinshasa]], the capital of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], destroying much of it.&lt;ref&gt;[[JLA Classified]] # 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; Many Superbian citizens were slain, at least one was eaten by Grodd.
 
Superbia made an appearance in issue 4 of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', where it served as Watchtower 5 of the global resistance against [[Darkseid]].  It was shown under attack by the [[justifiers]], with [[Warmaker]]{{dead link|date=October 2013}} stating that "Superbia is falling! ...  International Ultramarine Corps Headquarters is going down!"  Its subsequent destruction was not shown, only implied.

'''Survey of Israel - SOI''' ([[Hebrew]]: מפ"י - המרכז למיפוי ישראל) is the survey and mapping department of the [[Israel|Israeli]] [[Housing and Construction Minister of Israel|Ministry of Housing and Construction]]. 
== History ==
[[File:Survey of Israel building in 1930.jpg|thumb|the British survey department - 1930]]
The [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] established the country's first survey department in 1920.  In 1930, a building was erected to house the department at the southern end of a 30-acre plot near the German Templar cemetery in Tel Aviv. During [[World War II]], it was used by the British Army. 
Today, the main office of the Survey of Israel is located in [[Tel Aviv]] with branches in [[Jerusalem]], [[Be'er Sheva]], [[Haifa]] and [[Nazareth]].

== Survey of Israel responsibilities ==
[[File:Building of the Survey of Israel.jpg|thumb|the Survey of Israel building today]]
[[File:Ein Shemer Old Courtyard Museum 20171020 103528684.jpg|thumb|Measurement point number 1974 made by the Survey of Israel, located in Ein Shemer old courtyard]]
The Survey of Israel is the government agency for Mapping, Geodesy, Cadastre and Geoinformatics. The Survey is responsible for the national infrastructure in these areas as well as for a number of official functions.

In the field of geodesy, the Survey operates as the National Geodetic Institute, adopting the reference ellipsoid, developing and maintaining the geodetic control network, defining the national datum, both horizontal and vertical and establishing an appropriate projection with accompanying mapping equations and transformations, for applications in mapping, cadastre and geoinformatics. 

In the realm of cadastre the Survey leads activities leading to land registration (Land Surveys Department). The registration of rights to land is based on Torrens principles, which in effect provides a state guarantee of the rights registered. The Survey is responsible for defining boundaries of blocks and parcels in terms of coordinates and plans. All these procedures are anchored by Survey Ordinances. 
95% of the country's area has undergone the settlement process. All this area is subdivided into approximately 15,000 blocks and 800,000 parcels. The Survey deals every year with the continuation of settlement and also with new subdivision (re-parcellation) which express mutation in rights to land or its use, or both.

The Survey of Israel is the National Mapping Agency, responsible for defining mapping products required, with a special attention to construction infrastructures, security and emergency services, environmental protection, tourism and research and development. 
These tasks require the establishment of standards, coordinate networks including specifications for map projections, accuracy standards, practice of toponymy and symbology. 
The standard map series at the present is the 1:50,000, from which the 1:100,000 series is derived. The present editions of these series were produced by analogical methods and revised by digital methods. In addition, a number of 1:25,000 maps have been produced, all based on the National GIS digital data files, managed by the Survey. It would be appropriate to say that all map series are in the stage of transition to a digital cartographic process. Additional products worth mentioning are town plans and the Atlas of Israel being produced with the cooperation of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 

The topic of geoinformatics has been entrusted to the Survey by government decisions of 1990 and 1993, meaning that the Survey is responsible for the National GIS databank, including a uniform set of codes to ensure compatibility and an interministerial forum which is a platform for discussion and formulation of policy. 
The National GIS includes a topographic data bank, derived from aerial photographs at the scale 1:40,000 and periodically revised. The data bank consists of 10 data layers with appropriate codes. There is also a cadastral data bank, based on cadastral maps and plans. It is used to supply information and to manage cadastral operations, but it has no legal standing equal to the original documents. In addition, there is a bank of addresses, in larger population centers, managed in cooperation with the National Census Bureau.

[[Image:Syr Darya River Floodplain, Kazakhstan, Central Asia.JPG|thumb|Astronaut photograph of the Syr Darya River floodplain]]

The '''Syr Darya'''&lt;ref&gt;Also transliterated '''Syrdarya''' or '''Sirdaryo'''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɪər|ˈ|d|ɑr|.|j|ə}}; {{lang-kk|Сырдария}}, ''Syrdarııa'', سىردارٸيا; {{lang-rus|Сырдарья́|Syrdarjja|p=sɨrdɐˈrʲja}}; {{lang-fa|سيردريا|Sirdaryâ}}; {{lang-tg|Сирдарё|Sirdaryo}}; {{lang-tr|Seyhun, Siri Derya}}; {{lang-ar|سيحون|Seyḥūn}}; {{lang-uz|Sirdaryo/Сирдарё}}; {{lang-grc|Ἰαξάρτης}}, ''Jaxártēs''}} is a river in [[Central Asia]]. It originates in the [[Tian Shan|Tian Shan Mountains]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]] and eastern [[Uzbekistan]] and flows for {{convert|2212|km|mi}} west and north-west through Uzbekistan and southern [[Kazakhstan]] to the [[North Aral Sea|northern remnants]] of the [[Aral Sea]]. It is the northern and eastern of the two main rivers in the [[endorrheic basin]] of the Aral Sea, the other being the [[Amu Darya]]. In the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, extensive irrigation projects were constructed around both rivers, diverting their water into farmland and causing, during the post-Soviet era, the virtual disappearance of the Aral Sea, once the world's fourth-largest lake.

==Name==
The second part of the name (''Darya'' دریا) means "sea" in Persian. The current name dates only from the 18th century.

The earliest recorded name was ''Jaxartes'' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|dʒ|æ|ɡ|ˈ|z|ɑr|t|iː|z}} or ''Iaxartes'' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|aɪ|.|ə|ɡ|ˈ|z|ɑr|t|iː|z}} ({{lang|grc|Ἰαξάρτης}}) in [[Ancient Greek]], found in several sources, including those relating to [[Alexander the Great]]. The Greek name hearkens back to the [[Old Persian]] name ''Yakhsha Arta'' ("True Pearl"), perhaps a reference to the color of its glacially-fed water.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Islam"&gt;"Sïr Daryā." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Brill Online, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  More evidence for the Persian [[etymology]] comes from the river's Turkic name up to the time of the Arab conquest, the ''Yinchu'', or "Pearl river".&lt;ref name="В. В. Бартольд. К истории орошения Туркестана."&gt;В. В. Бартольд. К истории орошения Туркестана. (On the history of Irrigation in Turkestan) in Работы по исторической географии (Works on Historical Geography). Moscow: Vostochnaia Literatura, 2002. Pages 210-231&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Early Muslim conquests|Muslim conquest]], the river appears in the sources uniformly as the ''Seyhun'' (سيحون), one of the four rivers flowing from the [[Paradise]] ([[Jannah]] in [[Arabic]]).&lt;ref name="The introductory chapters of Yāqūt's Muʿjam al-buldān"&gt;The introductory chapters of Yāqūt's Muʿjam al-buldān, by Yāqūt ibn ʿAbd Allāh al-Ḥamawī, Page 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The current local name of the river, ''Syr'' (''Sïr''), does not appear before the 16th century. In the 17th century, [[Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur]] Khan, historian and ruler of [[Khiva]], called the [[Aral Sea]] the "Sea of Sïr," or ''Sïr Tengizi''.

==Geography==
The river rises in two [[headstream]]s in the [[Tian Shan|Tian Shan Mountains]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]] and eastern [[Uzbekistan]]—the [[Naryn River]] and the [[Kara Darya]] which come together in the Uzbek part of the [[Fergana Valley]]—and flows for some {{convert|2212|km|mi}} west and north-west through Uzbekistan and southern [[Kazakhstan]] to the remains of the Aral Sea. The Syr Darya drains an area of over {{convert|800000|km2|sqmi}}, but no more than {{convert|200000|km2|sqmi}} actually contribute significant flow to the river: indeed, two of the largest rivers in its basin, the [[Talas River|Talas]] and the [[Chu River|Chu]], dry up before reaching it. Its annual flow is a very modest &lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; {{convert|37|km3|acre.ft|lk=out}} per year—half that of its sister river, the [[Amu Darya]].

Along its course, the Syr Darya irrigates the most productive [[cotton]]-growing region in the whole of [[Central Asia]], together with the towns of [[Kokand]], [[Khujand]], [[Kyzylorda]] and [[Hazrat-e Turkestan|Turkestan]].

Various local governments throughout history have built and maintained an extensive system of [[canal]]s.&lt;ref name="В. В. Бартольд. К истории орошения Туркестана."/&gt; These canals are of central importance in this arid region. Many fell into disuse in the 17th and early 18th century, but the [[Khanate of Kokand]] rebuilt many in the 19th century, primarily along the Upper and Middle Syr Darya.

==Ecological damage==
Massive expansion of [[irrigation canal]]s in Middle and Lower Syr Darya during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period to water cotton and [[rice]] fields caused [[Environmental degradation|ecological damage]] to the area. The amount of water taken from the river was such that in some periods of the year, no water at all reaches the Aral Sea, similar to the Amu Darya situation in Uzbekistan and [[Turkmenistan]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==History==
[[Image:Khujand.jpg|thumb|Syr Darya River at Khujand]]
[[History of the central steppe]] introduces the history of the lands along and north of the Syr Darya. During the era of [[Alexander the Great]], the Syr Darya marked the northernmost limit of Hellenic conquests and also the site of a famous battle, the [[Battle of Jaxartes]]. It was on the shores of the Syr Darya that Alexander placed a garrison in the City of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] ([[Cyropolis]] in Greek), which he then renamed after himself [[Alexandria Eschate]] – "the farthest Alexandria"—in 329 BC. For most of its history since at least the [[Muslim]] Conquest of [[Central Asia]], the name of this city has been [[Khujand]] (in [[Tajikistan]]).

During the [[Russian conquest of Turkestan]] in the middle 19th century, the [[Russian Empire]] introduced steam navigation to the Syr Darya, with an important river port at Kazalinsk ([[Kazaly]]) from 1847 to 1882, when service ceased.

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Era, a resource-sharing system was instated in which Kyrgyzstan and [[Tajikistan]] shared water originating from the [[Amu Darya]] and Syr Darya rivers with [[Kazakhstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] in summer. In return, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received Kazakh, Turkmen, and Uzbek coal, gas, and electricity in winter. After the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] this system disintegrated and the [[Central Asia]]n nations have failed to reinstate it. Inadequate infrastructure, poor water management, and outdated irrigation methods all exacerbate the issue.&lt;ref&gt;International Crisis Group. "[http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/europe/central-asia/233-water-pressures-in-central-asia.pdf Water Pressures in Central Asia]", [http://www.crisisgroup.org CrisisGroup.org]. 11 September 2014.

Denmark generally uses an eight digit [[closed telephone numbering plan]]. Subscriber numbers are portable with respect to provider and geography, i.e. fixed line numbers can be ported to any physical address in Denmark.

The [[Kingdom of Denmark]] also includes two autonomous regions, the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Greenland]]. However, they are assigned each their own [[country calling code]] and are using different numbering plans.

[[Image:Tisvildeleje2004.jpg|right|thumbnail|400px|'''Tisvildeleje''', [[Denmark]]]]'''Tisvildeleje''' is the village and coastal part of the area known as [[Tisvilde]] located in on the north coast of the island [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] (Sjælland) in [[Denmark]] 60&amp;nbsp;km/40miles north of [[Copenhagen]] in the municipal of [[Helsinge]].

To the West, Tisvildeleje is bordered by the protected plantation of '''Tisvilde Hegn''' [hegn=fence], which is Denmark’s fifth largest forest. The beaches of Tisvildeleje, are known for their white sands and soft dunes.

==Etymology==
The name "Tisvilde" is derived from "Ti's vælde", meaning ''a place dedicated to the God Tyr''. Where the church of Tibirke Kirke is situated nowadays, there was once a prehistoric “vi” meaning a holy place or place of sacrifice. In prehistoric times, humans were sacrificed here. At the foot of the church, is a spring which may have been a place of pilgrimage in days of old. "Leje" roughly translates as ''plain'' and used to be a fishermans village. Now most of the fishermen's houses, are used as summer residences.{{cn|date=April 2014}}
 
'''Helene Spring''' in Tisvildeleje is located close to the sea and is among Denmark’s most famous springs. Legend has it, that anyone whose illness has not responded successfully to other forms of treatment, must come to the spring on 23 June, Sankt Hans or [[Midsummer's Eve]]. ''Draw the amount of water you expect to drink in the course of the night and then direct your steps towards Helene’s grave; stretched out there, drink of the mystic health-giving water, and when the morning light has finally dawned afresh, you will be cured of your ills.'' '''Helene's Tomb''' is now a rectangular, grazed area surrounded by low stone fences. The two boulders leaning against each other indicate Helene's Tomb. It is located at Sankt Helenevej, 3220 Tisvildeleje.{{cn|date=April 2014}}
