{{Nihongo|'''''1 Litre no Namida'''''|1リットルの涙|Ichi Rittoru no Namida|lit. "1 Litre of Tears"; also called '''''A Diary with Tears''''' or '''''A Diary of Tears'''''}} is a dramatic [[tragedy]] diary written by {{nihongo|[[Aya Kitō]]|木藤亜也|Kitō Aya|July 19, 1962 - May 23, 1988}} published shortly before her death.  The diary, a true story based on her own life, was originally written in first person. It is about a girl coping with her teenage life along with a degenerative disease.  She keeps a diary of not only what she does but how she feels and the hardships she must endure. Initially, the diary's purpose was for Kitō to chronicle impressions she had about how the disease was affecting her daily life.  As the disease progressed, however, the diary became Kitō's outlet for describing the intense personal struggles she underwent in coping, adapting, and ultimately trying to survive her disease.  As she notes in one entry, "I write because writing is evidence that I am still alive."

==Plot summary==

Aya Kitō was diagnosed with a disease called [[spinocerebellar degeneration]] when she was 15 years old.  The disease causes the person to lose control over their body, but because the person can retain all mental ability the disease acts as a prison. So in the end she cannot eat, walk or talk.

Through family, medical examinations and rehabilitations, and finally succumbing to the disease, Aya must cope with the disease and live on with life until her death at the age of 25.

=== Film ===
''[[A Litre of Tears (film)|A Litre of Tears]]'' is the film version of the drama.

=== TV series ===
A Japanese TV drama, with the same title ''[[1 Litre no Namida (TV series)|1 Litre no Namida]]'', was aired by Fuji TV in 2005 based on the life of Aya.  The main character Aya Ikeuchi, played by [[Erika Sawajiri]], depicts a girl with the same disease as Aya Kitō who goes through many of the same problems.

A Indonesian TV drama, with the title [[Buku Harian Nayla]], was aired by [[RCTI]] in 2006 based on the life of Aya. The main character Nayla, played by [[Chelsea Olivia]], depicts a girl with the same disease as Aya Kitō who goes through many of the same problems.

{{wiktionary|agon}}

'''Agon''' ([[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀγών}}) is an ancient Greek term for a struggle or contest. This could be a contest in athletics, in [[chariot#Greece|chariot]] or horse racing, or in music or literature at a public festival in ancient Greece. Agon is the word-forming element in 'agony', explaining the concept of agon(y) in [[tragedy]] by its fundamental characters, the [[protagonist]] and antagonist.

== Athletics ==

In one sense, agon meant a contest or a competition in athletics, for example, the [[Ancient Olympic games|Olympic Games]] (Ὀλυμπιακοὶ Ἀγῶνες). Agon was also a [[Greek mythology|mythological]] personification of the contests listed above.&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard  | author-link =   | contribution = Agon  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | page = 74  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0083.html | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;inconsistent citations&amp;#125;&amp;#125;  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This god was represented in a statue at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] with ''[[halteres (ancient Greece)|halteres]]'' ([[dumbbells]]) ({{lang|grc|ἁλτῆρες}}) in his hands.  This statue was a work of [[Dionysius (sculptor)|Dionysius]], and dedicated by Micythus of [[Rhegium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', book V (Elis), v. 26. § 3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==

Agon also referred to a challenge that was held in connection with [[religious festival]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Trapido (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; With a further religious meaning as used in [[1 Timothy]] 6:12 in the [[New Testament]] and defined by [[Strong's Concordance]] as, agón: a gathering, contest, struggle; as an (athletic) contest; hence, a struggle (in the soul).&lt;ref&gt;[http://concordances.org/greek/73.htm Strong's Concordance]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theater ==

In [[Ancient Greek theatre|Ancient Greek drama]], particularly [[Old Comedy]] (fifth century B.C.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humphreys|first=Milton W.|title=The Agon of the Old Comedy|journal=The American Journal of Philology|date=1887|volume=8|issue=2| pages=179–206|doi=10.2307/287385|jstor=287385}}&lt;/ref&gt; agon refers to a contest or debate between two characters - the prot''agonist'' and the ant''agonist'' - in the highly structured Classical [[tragedy|tragedies]] and [[drama]]s. The agon could also develop between an [[acting|actor]] and the [[choir]] or between two actors with half of the chorus supporting each. Through the argument of opposing principles, the agon in these performances resembled the dialectic dialogues of [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;["agon." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2014. Web. 17 Feb. 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the term has escaped the circumscriptions of its classical origins to signify, more generally, the conflict on which a literary work turns.

==Dance==
In 1948, [[Lincoln Kirstein]] posed the idea of a ballet that would later become known as ''[[Agon (ballet)|Agon]]''. After ten years of work before ''Agon'''s premiere, it became the final ballet in a series of collaborations between choreographer [[George Balanchine]] and composer [[Igor Stravinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alm |first1=Irene |title=Stravinsky, Balanchine, and Agon: An Analysis Based on the Collaborative Process |journal=The Journal of Musicology |date=April 1989 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=254–269 |doi=10.2307/763771}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balanchine referred to this ballet as "the most perfect work" to come out of the collaboration between Stravinsky and himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jordan |first1=Stephanie |title=Agon: A Musical/Choreographic Analysis |journal=Dance Research Journal |date=Autumn 1993 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.2307/1478549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==

[[Harold Bloom]] in ''The Western Canon'' uses the term ''agon'' to refer to the attempt by a writer to resolve an intellectual conflict between his ideas and the ideas of an influential predecessor in which "the larger swallows the smaller", such as in chapter 18, [[James Joyce|Joyce]]'s agon with [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].

In "Man, Play, and Games" [[Roger Caillois]] uses the term Agon to define games of competitive nature.

== Sociopolitical theory ==
In sociopolitical theory, agon can refer to the idea that the clash of opposing forces necessarily results in growth and progress.&lt;ref&gt;Colaguori 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivatives ==
Words derived from ''agon'' include [[wikt:agony|agony]], [[wikt:agonism|agonism]], [[wikt:antagonism|antagonism]], and [[wikt:protagonist|protagonist]].

[[File:Alciphron (1732) title page.jpg|thumb|''Alciphron'' title page (1732).]]
'''''Alciphron''''', or '''''The Minute Philosopher''''' is an [[anticatholic]] philosophical [[dialogue]] by the 18th-century Irish philosopher [[George Berkeley]] wherein Berkeley combated the arguments of [[free-thinkers]] such as [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville]] and [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] against the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[religion]]. It was first published in 1732.

The dialogue is primarily between four characters, the free-thinkers Alciphron and Lysicles, Berkeley's spokesman Euphranor, and Crito, who serves as a spokesman for traditional Christianity. The mostly-silent narrator of the dialogue is given the name Dion.

The work contains two especially notable sections:
* Dialogue IV, in which Berkeley presents a novel [[teleological argument]] for the existence of [[God]] based on Berkeley's theory of visual language, defended in the ''[[Essay Toward a New Theory of Vision]]'' (first published in 1709, and included with the first edition of ''Alciphron'').&lt;ref&gt;See David Kline, "Berkeley's Divine Language Argument" in Ernest Sosa, ed., ''Essays on the Philosophy of George Berkeley'' (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1987), repr. in David Berman, ed., ''Alciphron in Focus'' (London: Routledge, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Dialogue VII, in which Berkeley presents a novel theory of language which has been compared with the theory of language advocated by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in his ''Philosophical Investigations''.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Flew, "Was Berkeley a Precursor of Wittgenstein?" in W. B. Todd, ed. ''Hume and the Enlightenment: Essays Presented to Ernest Campbell Mossner'' (Edinburgh: The University Press, 1974), repr. in Berman, ed., ''Alciphron''.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a later work, ''[[The Theory of Vision Vindicated and Explained]]'' (first published in 1733), Berkeley adduced the work of [[Alberto Radicati]] as evidence that the views advocated by the character Lysicles were not overly exaggerated (para. 5).

The '''Artists Authorship Rights Act''' is a 1984 New York law that provides legal protection for artists' [[moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]].

The law was in part a reaction to California's passage of the [[California Art Preservation Act]], however the New York Act provided for artists the right to disavow works that were altered against their wishes.

The Act was preempted by the similar federal [[Visual Artists Rights Act]] of 1990 (VARA), as held in Board of Managers of Soho Int'l Arts Condominium v. City of New York (S.D.N.Y. 2003).

The '''Bardia Mural''' was created in a building on a clifftop overlooking the bay in [[Bardia]], [[Libya]], during [[World War II]] by [[John Frederick Brill]] just prior to his death at the age of 22.&lt;ref name="Commonwealth War Graves Commission"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts a collage of images that range from the horrors of war shown by skulls to the memories of home, shown by wine, women and song.

The mural still exists and can still be visited.  It has, however, been defaced and its state has declined with a large crack in the wall on which it was created.  Much of the lower part of the mural is lost.

As of April 2009, renovation work had been started by Italian artists who have filled the cracks and replaced broken plaster. Parts of the mural have been cleaned removing graffiti and restoring some of the 'blackness' of the paint.&lt;ref name="Donald Simmonds"&gt;

== Mural description ==
[[File:Bardia07.JPG|thumb|The Bardia Mural building.]]
As can be seen from the photograph taken in the sixties, while the mural was still largely intact, it originally depicted Brill's memories of home, as well as the horrors of war. From left to right images of a boxer overlay a newspaper, beneath which money and piles of skulls, are followed by grasping hands reaching up to repeated and overlaid images of apparently naked women, whose facial features change subtely. Above these women can be seen the artists signature reference to the [[Royal Army Service Corps|R.A.S.C.]] and the date of ''21 4 42'', with a further repetition of skulls above the signature. The image continues to unfold, on the other side of what appears to be a curtain separating the two sides of the mural, with pages of music, a grand piano and a table laid for a sumptious meal (many knives and forks), under which are fitted a number of books, which according to Lydia Pappas &lt;ref name="Lydia Pappas"&gt;

represent the works of [[Charles Dickens]] From left to right: ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]''; ''[[Barnaby Rudge]]''; ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]''; ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'' and ''The Pickwick Papers''. The image flows on to a conductor with more music, followed by a number of men's faces watching three ballet dancers, who are dancing on a floor of musical notes, the mural ends with the image of a face looking out of a window high up in a brick wall at the top right hand corner of the mural, which has variously been suggested to be the artist himself, or a relative back in "[[blighty]]" awaiting his return.

== History ==
[[Image:Alamein2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Commonwealth War Cemetery, [[El Alamein]]. John's final resting place.]]
According to his mother,&lt;ref name="Letter from J Brill's Mother"&gt;{{cite web |last=Seccombe |first=John |url=http://bardiamural.pbwiki.com/%5BBardiaMural |title=Letter to John Seccombe from Brill's Mother |accessdate=30 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brill developed a passion for art at a young age. Having studied at the [[Royal Academy]], he then went on to pass the entrance exam to study a 3 year diploma course at the [[Royal College of Art]] when the war broke out. His mother wrote, "His creed was that in order to become a great artist, he must suffer. Consequently he joined the Infantry, believing that to be the roughest and hardest of the services."&lt;ref name="Letter from J Brill's Mother" /&gt; He fought in Europe and survived Dunkirk, after which his regiment was posted to the Middle East

John Frederick Brill was a Private in the 5th Battalion of the [[East Yorkshire Regiment]].&lt;ref name="Commonwealth War Graves Commission"/&gt; He signed the mural on 21 April 1942,&lt;ref name="Signature"&gt;{{cite web |last=Simmonds |first=Donald |url=http://www.don-simmonds.co.uk/updates1.htm |title=Signature Close Up |accessdate=29 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; a matter of weeks before his death. He died on 1 July 1942, the first day of the [[First Battle of El Alamein]], aged 22.&lt;ref name="Commonwealth War Graves Commission" /&gt; He was buried at the El Alamein War Cemetery.&lt;ref name="Commonwealth War Graves Commission" /&gt;

===Controversy===
Early versions of the history of the Bardia Mural involved controversy. While it is commonly accepted that the mural was painted with paint, some versions stated that the material used to create the murals was Boot Black.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} There were also arguments over John's status when he painted the mural, indicating him as a [[prisoner of war]] or even under a [[death sentence]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} These three questions were referred to in a letter to the "Old Codgers" section of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Brill's mother Eliza later wrote a letter, to answer the controversies, on 31 January 1966, having been shown a copy of the article about the mural which she knew her son had painted before his death. In the letter she stated that he originally painted a mural on each of the "four walls of the lad's canteen, which represented 'A Soldier's leave in Cairo'. This - I understand, afforded them much interest &amp; amusement".&lt;ref name="Letter from J Brill's Mother" /&gt;
Following this the Officers asked Brill to create Murals in their Officer's Mess. According to John's mother the picture below represents one of these murals. The subjects being "The Pleasures of Avarice" and "The Pleasures of Art", and a third subject of "The Last Supper', "but this was never finished as his company was moved up the line." The Bardia Mural is likely to be one of these.&lt;ref name="Letter from J Brill's Mother" /&gt; She goes on in her letter to state "I am thankful to say, that he was not under sentence of death, neither was he ever a prisoner."&lt;ref name="Letter from J Brill's Mother" /&gt; She also states that the material used to create the various murals he painted during this period was paint, and not boot black; "paints were bought in Cairo, by the lads on leave and sent up by Convoy to Bardia. I understand that the costs were defrayed from the N.A.F.F.A. ''(sic)'' funds."&lt;ref name="Letter from J Brill's Mother" /&gt; It is likely that she meant to refer to [[NAAFI]] funds.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proprietor was Tom Miller, an aggressive businessman who would buy several neighboring properties as well. 

Bella Union Saloon was a relatively upscale establishment where town meetings came to be held.

In November 1878, Tom Miller went bankrupt and the Bella Union became a grocery store downstairs and a meeting hall named [[Mechanics Hall, Deadwood|Mechanics' Hall]] upstairs.

A fictionalized version of the saloon appeared in the [[HBO]] television series ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'', where the owner was the character [[List of Deadwood characters#Cy_Tolliver|Cy Tolliver]]. In the 1953 musical, [[Calamity Jane (film)|''Calamity Jane'']], the character Henry Miller (not Tom), is the proprietor of the town's saloon and theater.

The film was produced by [[Eric Eisner]] and [[Leonid Rozhetskin]], and directed by [[Duncan Ward]]. It stars [[Gillian Anderson]], [[Alan Cumming]], [[Stellan Skarsgaard]], [[Heather Graham (actress)|Heather Graham]], [[Danny Huston]], [[Amanda Seyfried]] and Sir [[Christopher Lee]].&lt;!-- list of stars taken from those with top billing on the poster --&gt; 

It premiered on 26 June 2009 at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edfilmfest.org.uk/whats-on/2009/boogie-woogie ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806025541/http://www.edfilmfest.org.uk/whats-on/2009/boogie-woogie |date=6 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
{{More plot|date=November 2015}} 
''Boogie Woogie'' is a [[comedy of manners]], its cast of characters devouring each other in a small world awash with big money.  Set against the backdrop of contemporary London and the international art scene, it casts an eye over the appetites and morality of some of its major players. Dealers, collectors, artists, and wannabes vie with each other in a world in which success and downfall rest on a thin edge.

==Production==
{{rquote|right|I hoped it would be a film from the start, and even wrote it in an [[Robert Altman|Altman-esque]] way, like ''[[Short Cuts]]'', but it took ten years.|Moynihan, on his novel and the film.&lt;ref name="scots"/&gt;}}

Danny Moynihan's novel for ''Boogie Woogie'' was published in 2000, based on his [[hedonism|hedonistic]] New York years.&lt;ref name="scots"/&gt;

[[Dennis Hopper]] originally held the [[option (filmmaking)|option]]  to adapt the novel into a screenplay for a film to be set in New York City; later, Moynihan's friend, Duncan Ward, a documentary film-maker, became involved, with [[Rachel Weisz]] agreeing to play the "central, nubile gallerist" role eventually portrayed by Graham.&lt;ref name="scots"/&gt;

After Weisz dropped out, producers switched the film's location to London for cost reasons; Moynihan "discovered then-unknown Amanda Seyfried living around the corner in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]" and got her cast as an "art-world nymphet"; Charlotte Rampling, a family friend of Moynihan's, got a [[cameo appearance]].&lt;ref name="scots"/&gt;  [[Principal photography]] took place in London in December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stellanonline.com/boogie.html ''Boogie Woogie''], production notes from a fansite for Stellan Skarsgård&lt;/ref&gt;

"who inspired its unsavoury characters"&amp;mdash;called it "''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]] and Hangs Out at Private Views'', but with a lot more sex and naughty bits."&lt;ref name="sundtimes"/&gt;  According to a [[National Public Radio]] review, "just about all the acting in this otherwise pedestrian satire is fabulous, and for want of other diversions you might amuse yourself itemizing all the squandered talent"; the film conflates "[[black comedy]] with cynicism" and "ends, dispiritingly, pretty much where it began."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Boogie Woogie': Slick Moves Among The Art Mob| url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126192774 | author= Ella Taylor| date= 22 April 2010 | publisher=[[National Public Radio]]| accessdate=2010-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[The Daily Beast]] called it a "dead-on satire of the contemporary art world that is loved by the very audience it savages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= The Art World's Devil Wears Prada| date= 13 May 2010 |author= James Reginato | url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-05-13/the-art-worlds-devil-wears-prada/full/ | publisher= [[The Daily Beast]]| accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rex Reed]] called it a "tepid spoof that only occasionally evokes a reluctant smile" and said it "failed to capture the nuances or craft a more brutal, incisive exposé of the art milieu."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= ''Boogie Woogie'': You Call This Art?| date= 21 April 2010 |author= [[Rex Reed]] | url= http://www.observer.com/2010/culture/you-call-art | publisher= [[The New York Observer]]| accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Palmes Otley.jpg|thumbnail|Brass rubbing of a memorial showing the alliance of the Lindley and Palmes family, [[Otley]] Church, West Yorkshire]]
[[File:Roger and Agnes Thornton Brass.jpg|thumb|upright|Rubbing of the Thorntons' brass, [[Newcastle Cathedral]] ([[Newcastle upon Tyne]])]]

'''Brass rubbing''' was originally a largely [[Great Britain|British]] enthusiasm for reproducing onto paper [[monumental brass]]es – commemorative [[brass]] plaques found in churches, usually originally on the floor, from between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries. The concept of recording textures of things is more generally called [[rubbing|making a rubbing]]. What distinguishes rubbings from [[frottage (art)|frottage]] is that rubbings are meant to reproduce the form of something being transferred, whereas frottage is usually only intended to use a general texture.

Brass rubbings are created by laying a sheet of paper on top of a brass (actually called "[[latten]]" - an alloy of brass and nickel) and rubbing the paper with [[graphite]], [[wax]], or [[chalk]], a process similar to rubbing a pencil over a piece of paper placed on top of a coin.  In the "old days" rubbings were most commonly made using the equivalent of what nowadays is called "[[Butcher paper|butcher's paper]]" [a {{convert|22|-|30|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} roll of whitish paper] laid down over the brass and rubbed with "heelball", a waxy glob of black crayon once used to shine shoes. Now most brass rubbers purchase special paper rolls of heavy duty black velvety material, and the crayons are gold, silver or bronze (other colours are available).

Brass plaques are slowly but surely worn away by the rubbing process and in many cases creating rubbings is banned.  Brass rubbing centres with replicas of original brass plaques have become a prime source for brass rubbings in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stmartin-in-the-fields.org/visit/things-to-see-and-do/|title=Things to see and do - St Martin-in-the-Fields|work=St Martin-in-the-Fields|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Replicas are often not the same scale as the original.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9807">A '''combination company''' was a theatrical [[touring company]] which performed only one [[Play (theatre)|play]]. Unlike [[repertory]] companies, which performed multiple plays in rotation, combination companies used more elaborate and specialized scenery in their productions. Repertory theatre had been popular in the United States through the 19th century, and it is not clear how the combination system originated. Combination companies contributed to the early success of [[Broadway theatre]], as most combination companies began their tours in [[New York City]]. Combination companies were fueled by stars. The Star agenda or star system that had been set in place in mid 19th century America helped greatly in the development of the combination company. The idea of celebrity was at full force and people would flock to theater houses to see their favorite stars perform. Stars made famous in New York would travel to stock theaters and perform limited engagements there. “The engagements of the first important stars… were rare and special events”(Poggi 4). Audiences would come in from all over to sold out performances at playhouses and see their favorite stars. The Stock companies would cancel their normal repertory programs for a few nights to allow for the show of the star. The star would be supported by the local company of actors in the play, which proved to be very frustrating to them (Poggi 5). After the star left, the company returned to its repertory schedule as per usual. Yet annoyed by the lack of talent from regional companies, the stars began to search for companies to tour with them. They began to tour with two or three actors, and then eventually whole companies would tour with them and they would perform a repertory of plays (Wilmeth 200-201). This switch to companies that support the stars for the whole tour was one more step in the transition from stock companies to combination companies.

== Repertory vs. combination ==
Repertory companies, both those in residence and those on tour, featured several actors who rehearsed multiple plays which were performed in rotation, adding and removing shows from their repertoire over time. Repertory theaters, also known as ''stock theaters'', generally employed generic [[theatrical properties]] for use in each of their productions. This system was popular throughout the [[United States]] in the 19th century (Somerset-Ward).

Because combination companies only performed a single play, they were not restricted by the need to use generic properties. Combination companies took advantage of this fact by specializing each asset of the company&amp;mdash;actors, rehearsals, [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]], properties, costumes and personnel&amp;mdash;to tailor to the needs of the one play being performed (Londré). In particular, this enabled combination companies to use more elaborate scenery than their repertory counterparts (Somerset-Ward).

== Origin ==
It is not entirely clear how the combination system originated. American actress [[Laura Keene]] toured with a combination company as early as 1862. American actor [[Joseph Jefferson]] claimed that both he and [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]] independently established the combination system in 1868 with their productions of ''[[Rip van Winkle]]'' and ''[[The Lancers]]'', respectively. The advent of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] may have contributed to the success of touring companies (Londré).

Many early touring companies found success by exclusively performing renditions of the immensely popular [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]], an anti-[[slavery]] novel published in 1852 by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. In 1927, 75 years after Uncle Tom's Cabin had been published, these renditions, known as [[Tom Shows]] (Londré), were still being performed exclusively by twelve combination companies worldwide (Somerset-Ward).

Most of the combination companies in the United States rehearsed and began their tours in [[New York City]], which contributed to the early success of what would eventually be known as [[Broadway theatre]]. The combination company system was so successful throughout the United States that [[Dion Boucicault]], an Irish actor and playwright, brought it to England for the first tour of his play ''[[The Colleen Bawn]]'' in the 1860s (Somerset-Ward).

== Circuits and the syndicate ==
Another way the combination business was run was through circuits. Local managers struggled with finding a continuous flow of touring companies, because it required them to take multiple trips to New York to make deals with producers. “Booking a successful season of touring productions was a complex gamble for the theatre manager,” so the solution was to create a travel circuit. (Toten Beard 35).  A travel circuit is when a group of the theaters all in the same state or neighboring states would band together under one theater manager who would then go to New York to make deals with the Broadway Producers (Toten Beard 25). This idea was much more beneficial for the producer because it provided multiple stops of a tour all guaranteed under one business deal and made tour planning much simpler. It was helpful to the local theater managers because it provided a steady stream of business to help keep their theater afloat and also helped them to get the most popular and raved about shows to travel through their city (Poggi10).  This soon grew into managers from theaters in a large city taking advantage of the smaller theaters by buying them out or making them pay interest to the larger theater (Poggi 10). M.B. Leavitt was the manager of a popular theater in San Francisco and is given the credit of developing “loosely organized circuits” into centralized booking agencies, which controlled the theatre in large segments of the country (Poggi 11). He did this by adding small theaters from Omaha to San Francisco to the circuit and having them pay him to provide for the traveling expenses of the company. This brought attention to the company because they would be guaranteed sold out one-night stands in smaller towns and a sold out long run in San Francisco (Poggi 10-11). This became the foundation of what became a Syndicate.
Through the centralization of booking, booking agents became extremely important in negotiations between local managers and circuit representatives. These booking agencies grew in power by monopolizing all the theaters in a certain region of America, claiming “that it was more efficient for a theater or a circuit to do all its booking through one agency” (Poggi 11).  In 1896 the ultimate monopoly of the theater booking industry of traveling companies was created. It was called the [[Theatrical Syndicate]] and was formed by six booking agents who pooled together thirty-three of the top theaters from major cities around the country, which were then called Syndicate houses (Poggi 11). If a producer played in one Syndicate house on his tour then every city he performed in, if there was a syndicate house there, he would have to perform at that house and no other theater (Poggi 12). The Syndicate was the foremost business power in Theater during the late 1800s and early 1900s and was very similar to the other “giant ‘trusts’ of its day”(Poggi 13). It had no competition so it was able to choose its prices and fees that it took from the producers, managers and circuits under their control and demanded percentages of the profits of the shows. It was the height of the centralization of the theater business (Poggi 13-14). The Theatrical Syndicate allowed for the business of touring shows and combination companies to be managed in one centralized place, New York City. The Syndicate began to lose power with what is called the death of the road and the rise of motion pictures.

== The death of the road ==
The death of the road started happening after 1915 due to sinking profits, increased travel expenses and lower quality touring productions (Toten Beard 37). Theater began to be based in New York with no intentions of touring, because the Syndicate monopoly had been corrupted and was producing low art productions (Toten Beard 37). New York became the producing center and the most important city for producing theater. The long runs were reestablished and producers now began looking for the next best play that could last multiple performances. Also the rise of motion pictures drew audiences away from touring shows, because they offered the same stars and entertainment but at a cheaper price and more diverse productions. Slowly but surely playhouses converted back to regional theaters and combination companies became non-existent.

'''''Dubgaill''''' and '''''Finngaill''''', or '''''Dubgenti''''' and '''''Finngenti''''', are [[Middle Irish]] terms used to denote different rival groups of [[Viking]]s in Ireland and [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Literally, ''Dub-/Finngaill'' is translated as "dark and fair foreigners"&lt;ref name="Downham07xvf"&gt;[[#Downham07|Downham (2007)]], pp. xv–xviii&lt;/ref&gt; or "black and white foreigners",&lt;ref name="Smyth 1974, p. 101"&gt;[[#Smyth74|Smyth (1974)]], p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; and similarly, ''Dub-/Finngenti'' as "dark/black" and "fair/white heathens". Similar terms are found in Welsh chronicles, probably derived from Gaelic usage.&lt;ref name="Dumville08355" /&gt; The first known use of these terms in the chronicles is from 851, when it is noted that "The Dubhghoill arrived in Ath Cliath [Dublin], and made a great slaughter of the Finnghoill".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[#AFM|AFM 849.9]] [=851], similar [[#AU|AU 851.3]] "Tetact Dubgennti du Ath Cliath co ralsat ár mór du Fhinngallaibh", translated as "The dark heathens came to Áth Cliath, made a great slaughter of the fair-haired foreigners"&lt;/ref&gt; The terms appear, with various spellings, in entries in [[Irish annals]] from the 9th and 10th century, and are also used and interpreted in later [[historiography]].

There have been different interpretations of the terms. Traditionally, historians have speculated whether these distinctions refer to physical features such as skin or hair-colour, weaponry or outfits.&lt;ref name="Downham07xvf" /&gt; [[Alfred P. Smyth]] suggested a new interpretation of ''dub'' and ''finn'' as "new" and "old".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smyth74|Smyth (1974)]]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a long tradition of understanding ''Dubgaill'' as Danish Vikings and ''Finngaill'' as Norwegian Vikings. This interpretation has recently been challenged by [[David N. Dumville]] and [[Clare Downham]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Downham09|Downham (2009)]], p. 139 note 2&lt;/ref&gt; who, building on Smyth's conclusions, propose that the terms may not be related to ethnicity or origin of the different groups of Vikings.

In later times, centuries after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]], the [[Hiberno-Normans]] or so-called [[Old English (Ireland)]] were also referred to as Dubgaill and Finngaill.

==Etymology==
The word ''Gaill'' (plural of ''Gall'') etymologically originates from "[[Gauls]]", who in pre-Viking Gaelic history were the archetypal "foreigners". Dumville says that "what [the Gauls] had done in Gaelic prehistory to gain that status is unknown and was probably unpleasant."&lt;ref name="Dumville08355"&gt;[[#Dumville08|Dumville (2008)]], p. 355&lt;/ref&gt; During the Viking age, it came to denote Scandinavians or those of Scandinavian descent or speech. From the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in the late 12th century, this appellation was passed on to foreigners of French speech and then to the English at large.&lt;ref name="Dumville08355" /&gt; The word did not denote "foreigner" in the sense "anyone not Irish (Gaelic)", but the [[Saxon]]s, [[Welsh people|Welsh]] and [[Picts]] are identified as such in the Irish annals, and there are also terms used which may identify the Scandinavians based on nationality, like ''Dene'', ''Northmanni'' and ''[[Lochlainn]]''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The accuracy of the early references to the homelands of the Scandinavians are controversial, for a thorough discussion on the identification of such terms in insular chronicling with later national entities like Norway and Denmark, see [[#Downham09|Downham (2009)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another word frequently used by the chroniclers in the early phase of the [[Viking Age#Ireland|Viking age]] was ''Gen(n)ti'', meaning "foreigner of a different religion". This was derived from the biblical usage of the Latin phrase ''gentes'' or ''gentiles'', the latter form common in traditional English translations of the Bible. This terminology was abandoned, which has been taken as recognition of eventual conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Dumville08355" /&gt;

The literary meaning of [[Old Irish]] and [[Old Welsh]] ''Dub'' is normally given as "dark" or "black", while Middle Irish ''finn'' (Old Irish ''find'', Modern Irish ''fionn'') is given as "light" or "white".&lt;ref name="Dumville08355" /&gt; Smyth, referring to the [[Dictionary of the Irish Language]] by the [[Royal Irish Academy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DIL |title=dub; 1 finn; 1 Gall |pages=Letter D, columns 425–30; Letter F, columns 141–3; Letter G, columns 38–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; adds that ''Dub'' can mean "gloomy" or "melancholy" in a moral sense, and has the intensive meaning of "great" or "mighty". For ''finn'' there are the additional meanings of "handsome", "just" and "true".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smyth74|Smyth (1974)]], p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation history==

===The meaning of ''Finn-'' and ''Dub-''===
Historians have offered various explanations to account for the fact that terms associated with colour denote two separate factions of Vikings. The explanation which has been most widely accepted is that it either relates to hair-colour or armour.&lt;ref name="Smyth103f"&gt;[[#Smyth74|Smyth (1974)]], pp. 103–106&lt;/ref&gt; The view that it relates to colour was held, for instance, by the Danish antiquary [[Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae]]&lt;ref name="Smyth103f" /&gt; and [[James Henthorn Todd]];&lt;ref&gt;[[#Todd|Todd (1869)]], p. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; but it also occurs in more modern historical works like in Mac Airt &amp; Mac Niocaill's 1983 edition of [[Annals of Ulster]] where ''Fhinngallaibh'' is translated "fair-haired foreigners".&lt;ref&gt;[[#AU|AU 851.3]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Smyth, the most bizarre explanation of the terms was put forward by [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]]. He suggested that the "Black foreigners" were [[Moorish]] slaves, carried off to Ireland in a Viking raid on North Africa.&lt;ref name="Smyth103f" /&gt;

Jón Steffensen, while rejecting the fair- and dark-haired hypothesis, suggested that the terms originated from the colours on the shields of the Vikings, the ''finngaill'' carrying white shields and the ''dubgaill'' red.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Steffensen|Steffensen (1970)]], pp. 59, 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Smyth gives arguments against all colour-related distinctions.&lt;ref name="Smyth103f" /&gt; Referring to Steffensen,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Steffensen|Steffensen (1970)]], p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; he dismisses the assumption that "any large Scandinavian host could be composed exclusively and over a long period of dark-haired individuals" as being unrealistic. As an argument against Steffensen theory of shield-colour, as well as other theories based on colour of armour, he asserts that regular uniform and equipment were unknown in early medieval Germanic armies, and that "Norwegian pirates could afford the luxury of carrying nothing but white shields is fanciful to the extreme". As a final argument against distinction in colour between Viking factions, Smyth notes that even though these Vikings were active elsewhere, no Anglo-Saxon or Frankish chroniclers have mentioned any particular colour-distinction.&lt;ref name="Smyth103f" /&gt;

Smyth concludes that in this context,  ''finn'' and ''dub'' should not be related to colour or brightness, but must be translated as "old" and "new". He finds precedent for this in part on Mageoghagan's translations of the [[Annals of Clonmacnoise]] from the early 17th century, where [[Sihtric Cáech|Sihtric (Sigtrygg) Cáech]] in his epitaph is called "prince of the new&amp;nbsp;&amp;&amp;nbsp;old Danes".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smyth74|Smyth (1974)]], pp 108f. [[#Murphy|Murphy (1896)]], p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norwegians and Danes?===
The identification of ''Finngaill'' as Norwegian and ''Dubgaill'' as Danish has had a long tradition, but it was first made long after the terms fell out of contemporary use.&lt;ref name="Downham07xvf" /&gt; According to Smyth, the oldest Irish source that equates the ''Dub''- with Danes is the 12th-century ''[[Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib]]'', who speaks of "Danish Black Gentiles" (''Duibgeinti Danarda'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smyth74|Smyth (74)]], p. 102, [[#Todd|Todd (1869)]], p.18-ch.XX, p.229 (trans)&lt;/ref&gt; Downham points out that the last contemporary use of the terms may be ''[[Chronicon Scotorum]]'' ''sub anno'' 941.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CS|CS 941]], [[#Downham07|Downham (2007)]], p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; According to Smyth, medieval Irish writers and later Gaelic antiquaries such as [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]] and [[Geoffrey Keating]] "were clear on overall Norwegian origin of the ''Finn Gaill'' and the Danish origin of the ''Dub Gaill''".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smyth74|Smyth (1974)]], p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Smyth also states that "it is clear from references to Scandinavian activity of the ninth and tenth century within Ireland that the 'White Foreigners' had a predominantly Norwegian origin, and that their opposite number were Danes", without giving any further references for this conclusion.&lt;ref name="Smyth 1974, p. 101"/&gt;

Smyth argued that ''Finn-'' and ''Dub-'' did not imply an ethnic distinction but rather "old" and "new", and also pointed out that "large viking armies were not exclusively either Danish or Norwegian".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smyth74|Smyth (1974)]], p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; He still did not question the identification as Norwegian/Danish. Downham has pointed out that by the time the first sources equating these terms with Norwegian/Danish were written down, changes in Scandinavia had made the Irish aware of a distinction between Norwegians and Danes,&lt;ref name="Downham07xvf" /&gt; a distinction the Irish (or for that matter the "Norwegian" or "Danes") would not have been aware of in the middle of the 9th century. Downham argues that a "new interpretation was interposed on the earlier terms 'Fair Foreigner' and 'Dark Foreigner'".&lt;ref name="Downham07xvf" /&gt;

Downham, with reference to a suggestion made by Dumville, offers the alternative interpretation that ''finngaill'' and ''dubgaill'' identified Viking groups under different leadership. The ''dubgaill'' may identify Vikings under the leadership of the [[Uí Ímair]], while the ''finngaill'' were those "old" Vikings present in Ireland before the middle of the 9th century.&lt;ref name="Downham07xvf" /&gt; The rivalry between the Uí Ímair and other groups persisted long after the Uí Ímair had gained control over Dublin, and their hegemony over the Viking settlements in Ireland was established when [[Amlaíb mac Gofraid (died 941)|Amlaíb mac Gofraid]] defeated the Vikings of Limerick. After the death of Ámlaib, the label ''finngaill'' fell out of contemporary use in Irish chronicles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Downham07|Downham (2007)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;36–37, note 141&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imperial style==
The style ''King of the Dubgaill and Finngaill'' (or vice versa) was an imperial one held only by three or four dynasts of the [[Uí Ímair]].

* [[Ragnall ua Ímair]], the first
* [[Sitric Cáech]], the most celebrated
* ([[Gofraid ua Ímair]]), styled simply ''Rí Gall'' (King of the Foreigners) in the surviving sources
* [[Amlaíb mac Gofraid (died 941)|Amlaíb mac Gofraid]], his son and the last, styled also ''King of Ireland'' in Anglo-Saxon sources

==Reception==
''Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me'' holds a 98% rating at Rotten Tomatoes from 53 reviews. The critical consensus reads: "Brutally honest and utterly compelling, ''Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me'' offers a riveting, vanity-free portrait of its legendary subject while offering a few essential truths about the [[human condition]]."&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/elaine_stritch_shoot_me_2013/|title=Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jake Coyle of [[The Associated Press]] called it "an irresistibly entertaining documentary that captures Stritch during what she unsentimentally calls 'almost post-time.' After seven decades performing in [[New York City|New York]] — on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], in countless [[cabaret]] nights at the [[Cafe Carlyle]] — Stritch's enormous energy has been knocked by the increasing years, [[diabetes]], and surgeries on her hip and eyes. But ''Shoot Me'', made over the last few years, is a document not of Stritch's dwindling, but of her feisty persistence."&lt;ref name=AssociatedPress&gt;{{cite news|last=Coyle|first=Jake|title=Movie review: 'Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me'|url=http://www.masslive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/03/movie_review_elaine_stritch_sh.html|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=''[[Associated Press]]''|date=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arch of Traianus, Ancona - Tasso in Prison; - the Bridge of Sighs.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|''[[Torquato Tasso#La Gerusalemme Liberata|Jerusalem Delivered]], an Heroic Poem'', translated from the Italian of [[Torquato Tasso]], by John Hoole. London 1797; with fore-edge painting: ''[[Arch of Trajan (Ancona)|Trajan's Arch]]'', ([[Ancona]]), ''Tasso in Prison'', and the ''[[Bridge of Sighs]]'']]
A '''fore-edge painting''' is a scene [[Painting|painted]] on the edges of the pages of a [[book]]. There are two basic forms, including paintings on edges that have been fanned and edges that are closed; thus with the first instance a book edge must be fanned to see the painting and in the second the painting is on the closed edge itself and thus should not be fanned. A fanned painting is one that is not visible when the book is closed.

In order to view the painting, the [[Bookbinding#Terms and techniques|leaves]] of the book must be fanned, exposing the edges of the pages and thereby the painting. Another basic difference is that a painting on the closed edge is painted directly on the surface of the book edge (the fore-edge being the opposite of the spine side). For the fanned painting the watercolor is applied to the top or bottom margin (recto or verso) of the page/leaf and not to the actual "fore"-edge itself.

==Variations==
A '''single fore-edge painting''' includes a painting on only one side of the book page edges. Generally, [[Gilding|gilt]] or [[Paper marbling|marbling]] is applied by the [[Bookbinding|bookbinder]] after the painting has dried, so as to make the painting completely invisible when the book is closed.

A '''double fore-edge painting''' has paintings on both sides of the page margin so that one painting is visible when the leaves are fanned one way, and the other is visible when the leaves are fanned the other way.

A '''triple fore-edge painting''' has, in addition to paintings on the edges, a third painting applied directly to the edges (in lieu of gilt or marbling). Edge paintings that are continuous scenes wrapped around more than one edge are called '''panoramic fore-edge painting'''. These are sometimes called a 'triple edge painting'.&lt;ref name=Bromer&gt;{{cite web|last=Bromer|first=Anne C.|title=Fore Edge Painting - An Introduction|url=http://foreedge.bpl.org/node/923|work=On the Edge: The Hidden Art of Fore-Edge Book Painting|publisher=Boston Public Library|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frost&gt;{{cite web|last=Frost|first=Martin|title=What Is A Fore-Edge Painting?|url=http://foreedge.bpl.org/node/2|work=On the Edge: The Hidden Art of Fore-Edge Book Painting|publisher=Boston Public Library|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''split''' '''double painting''' has two different illustrations, one on either side of the center of the book. When the book is laid open in the center, one illustration is seen on the edges of the first half of the book, and another illustration is on the edge of the second half of the book.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/lovely-hidden-paintings-adorned-the-edges-of-historic-books|title=Lovely Hidden Paintings Adorned the Edges of Historic Books|date=2016-09-29|work=Atlas Obscura|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are even examples of rare variations that require the pages of the book to be pinched or tented in a certain way to see the image.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
The earliest fore-edge paintings date possibly as far back as the 10th century; these earliest paintings were symbolic designs. Early [[England|English]] fore-edge paintings, believed to date to the 14th century, presented [[Heraldry|heraldic]] designs in gold and other colors. The first known example of a ''disappearing'' fore-edge painting (where the painting is not visible when the book is closed) dates from 1649. The earliest signed and dated fore-edge painting dates to 1653: a family coat of arms painted on a 1651 [[Bible]].

There is an interesting legend of how hidden fore-edge painting on books supposedly first began: Charles II of England had a lady friend, a duchess, who often borrowed his books, sometimes forgetting to return them. As the story goes, the king commissioned the court painter, Sir [[Peter Lely]], and the court bookbinder, [[Samuel Mearne]], to devise a secret method in which his books could be identified. Between the two they worked out a unique plan. Some weeks later, when the king was visiting the duchess he spotted a familiar looking book on a shelf. Taking it down he said, “I’ll just take my book along with me.” “But sire,” the lady protested, “that book is mine.” “Oh?" The king raised his brows. Then, with a sly smile, he fanned out the book and revealed what had been painted on the inner edges--the royal coat of arms. The gilding on the outer edges had completely hidden the identification. Acknowledging that Charles had outwitted her, the duchess sank in a deep curtsy before her king.&lt;ref&gt;Dutter, Vera, E. [http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/51833306/ancient-art-fore-edge-painting "The Ancient Art of Fore-Edge Painting"], ''[[American Artist]]'', January 1969. Retrieved on 3 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=May 2018}}

Around 1750, the subject matter of fore-edge paintings changed from simply decorative or heraldic designs to [[Landscape art|landscapes]], [[portraits]] and religious scenes, usually painted in full color. Modern fore-edge painted scenes have a lot more variation as they can depict numerous subjects not found on earlier specimens. These include scenes that are erotic, or they might involve scenes from novels (like Jules Verne, Sherlock Holmes or Dickens, etc.). In many cases, the chosen scene will depict a subject related to the book, but in other cases it did not. In one instance, the same [[New Brunswick]] landscape was applied to both a Bible and to a collection of poetry and plays. The choice of scenes is made by either the artist, bookseller or owner, thus the variety is wide.

The technique was popularized in the 18th century by John Brindley (1732 - 1756),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The majority of extant examples of fore-edge painting date to the late 19th and early 20th centuries on reproductions of books originally published in the early 19th century.

Artists currently expert in the fore-edge artform include UK-based artists, Martin Frost and Clare Brooksbank. The reference book of L. Jeff Weber lists many artists' and binders' names associated with this art form, including those working presently (until 2010).

==Education and career==
He received a BA from [[Florida State University]] in 1949 and a PhD from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1959.&lt;ref name = "faculty" /&gt; He was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/78fellow.html |title=1978 U.S. and Canadian Fellows |website=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation |accessdate=5 May 2014 via Wayback Machine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312160335/http://www.gf.org/78fellow.html |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as President of the Illinois Philosophy Association (1990–91) and President of the [[American Society for Aesthetics]] (1993–94).

==Work==
He is an influential philosopher of art working in the analytical tradition. His [[institutional theory of art]] inspired both supporters who produced variations on the theory as well as detractors.

One of his more influential works is ''The Century of Taste'' (1996), an inquiry into several eighteenth-century philosophers' treatments of the subject.  The bulk of the work is devoted to championing [[David Hume]]'s treatment of the subject over that of [[Immanuel Kant]].  A review of the work can be found in ''[[The Philosophical Review]]'', 107:3 (July, 1998).

'''''Grumbles from the Grave''''' is a posthumous 1989 autobiography of science fiction author [[Robert A. Heinlein]] collated by his wife [[Virginia Heinlein]] from his notes and writings.

==Background==
The work is the closest that Heinlein, an ex-naval officer and prominent [[science fiction]] writer, came to writing an autobiography. The book contains a wide range of correspondence, notes and memoirs edited by Heinlein's wife Virginia, and was published a year and a half after his death.

==Contents==
''Grumbles from the Grave'' provides insight into Heinlein's writing process (and the editorial/publishing process with which he was often at odds).   In addition, it contains evidence of his philosophy as applied to his life and personal opinions.  Beginning with a short biography of Robert by Virginia, the bulk of the book consists of excerpts of correspondence from the period from 1939 to 1970, from when he began writing science fiction until the onset of his first major illness. There is considerable information provided into how the 13-year gestation of Heinlein's novel ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' evolved. Additionally there is the original postlude to ''[[Podkayne of Mars]]'' and a discussion of cuts made to his novel, ''[[Red Planet (novel)|Red Planet]]''.

==Criticisms==
[[Frederik Pohl]] has complained "Robert had talked about allowing posthumous publication of his real feelings about a lot of things that he didn’t feel comfortable to talk about while he was alive, and indicated that some of his private letters would be a source for the book. Then some posthumous book with that title did come out, and it was a great disappointment. Someone — it could have been only [Virginia Heinlein] — had washed his face and combed his hair and turned whatever it was that Robert might have wanted to say into the equivalent of thank-you notes for a respectable English tea. I know that Robert wrote some much more raunchy letters than any of those, because I myself got one or two. But all the raunch has been edited out. What’s left is actually rather boring and does a great disservice to the real Heinlein, whose physical person may have been embodied as a conventional hard-right conservative but whose writing was — sometimes vulgarly — that of a free-thinking iconoclast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewaythefutureblogs.com/2010/05/the-wives-and-drives-of-robert-heinlein-ginny/ |title=The Wives (and Drives) of Robert Heinlein: Ginny |publisher=Thewaythefutureblogs.com |date=2010-05-21 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
The book was a finalist for the 1990 [[Hugo Award for Best Non-Fiction Book]].

==Selected quotes==
* ''"How long has this racket been going on?"'' — Heinlein's remark after receiving a $70 US check for his first published story..
* ''"I expect this to be my last venture in this field; 'tain't worth the grief"'' — Heinlein's response to attempts to censor his juvenile novel ''Red Planet'' for language, violence, and references to reproduction among Martians..

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7799">The '''Guild of Women-Binders''' was an organization founded to promote and distribute the work of women [[Bookbinding|bookbinders]] at the turn of the 20th century. It was founded by Frank (Francis) Karslake in 1898, and disbanded in 1904. It helped sell bindings produced by women binders already practicing, and instituted training programs to teach other women.

Likely bound by Gwladys Edwards.]]

Frank Karslake was a [[London]] [[Bookselling|bookseller]], and a founder and financial backer of the Hampstead Bindery.&lt;ref name="ABM blog"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bindings Of To-Morrow|url=http://bookbindersmuseum.org/the-bindings-of-to-morrow/|website=American Bookbinders' Museum Blog|publisher=American Bookbinders' Museum|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1897 Victorian Era Exhibition at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earl's Court]], he encountered several bindings by women, including [[Annie S. Macdonald]], on display, and his interest was piqued. Soon after, he invited several women binders to exhibit their work in his London shop; this "Exhibition of Artistic Bookbinding by Women," which ran from November 1897 to February 1898, garnered a substantial amount of interest from the public, and convinced him that promoting women's bookbindings could be a profitable venture, if perhaps partially for the novelty.&lt;ref name="fincham"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fincham|first1=Ernest C.|title=Women as bookbinders|journal=Hearth and Home (reprinted)|date=1901|url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/umn.31951t000266796|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever his motivations, Karslake soon began acting as an agent to women binders already practicing, such as Annie MacDonald and Edith and Florence de Rheims.&lt;ref name="ABM blog" /&gt;

By May 1898, the Guild of Women Binders was open as a business venture, headquartered at Karslake's bookstore at 61 [[Charing Cross Road]]. Karslake "saw that more money could be made by teaching to bind than by only binding and selling books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tidcombe|first1=Marianne|title=Women bookbinders 1880-1920|date=1996|publisher=Oak Knoll Press|location=New Castle, DE|isbn=9781884718236|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that women were well-suited to be bookbinders, due to their "inborn reverence for the beautiful" and their deftness of hand.&lt;ref name="express"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bookbinding as a profession for women|journal=Daily Express|date=1901|url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/umn.31951t000266796|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He focused on both promoting the work of women already engaged in bookbinding, and training additional women to create bindings. Every member of the Guild received training in hand-bookbinding, and were offered employment after they completed this training.&lt;ref name="ABM blog" /&gt; [[File:Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery - Upper cover (c108bbb8).jpg|thumb|An edition of "Poems descriptive of rural life and scenery" by [[John Clare]], produced by the Guild of Women Binders, held at the [[British Library]].]]

Members and associates of the Guild of Women Binders carved out a niche for themselves at the end of the 19th century by producing fine, artistic bindings by hand in an era when bookbinding was becoming increasingly mechanized. As part of its training efforts, the Guild set up a workshop, headed by Karslake's daughter Constance, near the Hampstead Bindery in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tidcombe|first1=Marianne|title=Women bookbinders 1880-1920|date=1996|publisher=Oak Knoll Press|location=New Castle, DE|isbn=9781884718236|pages=115, 120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guild accepted for training only women with an art school background, likely limiting them to a small pool of middle-class women; by 1903, they had an estimated 25-30 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tidcombe|first1=Marianne|title=Women bookbinders 1880-1920|date=1996|publisher=Oak Knoll Press|location=New Castle, DE|isbn=9781884718236|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the artistic styles of the time, many of the bindings featured [[Art Nouveau]] patterns, with sweeping lines and elegantly curved shapes. Karslake's advertising claimed that each binding was decorated with a unique pattern, though several patterns seem to have been variations of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tidcombe|first1=Marianne|title=Women bookbinders 1880-1920|date=1996|publisher=Oak Knoll Press|location=New Castle, DE|isbn=9781884718236|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guild promoted and sold not only its own bindings, but also those of other groups such as the Chiswick Art Guild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tidcombe|first1=Marianne|title=Women bookbinders 1880-1920|date=1996|publisher=Oak Knoll Press|location=New Castle, DE|isbn=9781884718236|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the presence of a stamp of the Guild of Women Binders on a book may not necessarily mean that it was created by the Guild unless the individual binder can be identified, and may mean "little more than a bookseller's stamp."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tidcombe|first1=Marianne|title=Women bookbinders 1880-1920|date=1996|publisher=Oak Knoll Press|location=New Castle, DE|isbn=9781884718236|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the Guild was not a successful business venture, possibly due to Karslake's inexperience in the professional bookbinding world (despite his associations with several binding operations, he had never worked as a binder himself). Karslake had tried to grow the Guild too far and too fast, taking on more students than teachers, and expecting too much out of his teaching staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tidcombe|first1=Marianne|title=Women bookbinders 1880-1920|date=1996|publisher=Oak Knoll Press|location=New Castle, DE|isbn=9781884718236|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some professional bookbinders suspected that the bindings were too sophisticated to have been produced by women, especially recently trained ones; a few even accused Karslake of passing off the work of the Hampstead Bindery as Guild work. Potential buyers began to mistrust Karslake and the guild's products (with some justification, as Karslake and his workshops had little knowledge of sound bookbinding techniques such as those practiced by other [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] binders of the time), and many bindings went unsold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tidcombe|first1=Marianne|title=Women bookbinders 1880-1920|date=1996|publisher=Oak Knoll Press|location=New Castle, DE|isbn=9781884718236|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guild was shuttered in 1904, leaving Karslake bankrupt and many of the women who had worked with him tainted by the controversy (though some did go on to continue independent careers as bookbinders).&lt;ref name="ABM blog" /&gt;

The concept of the theater was born in 1959 in a series of discussions between Sir [[Tyrone Guthrie]], Oliver Rea and Peter Zeisler.  Disenchanted with [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], they intended to form a theater with a resident acting company, to perform classic plays in rotating repertory, while maintaining the highest professional standards.

The Guthrie Theater has performed in two main-stage facilities. The first building was designed by [[Ralph Rapson]], included a 1,441-seat thrust stage designed by [[Tanya Moiseiwitsch]], and was operated from 1963–2006. After closing its 2005–2006 season, the theater moved to its current facility designed by [[Jean Nouvel]].

In 1982, the theater won the [[Regional Theatre Tony Award]].

==History==
In 1959, [[Sir Tyrone Guthrie]] published a small invitation in the drama page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' soliciting communities' interest and involvement in a resident theater. Out of the seven cities that responded, the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Twin Cities]] showed not only interest but also eagerness for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.guthrietheater.org/about_the_guthrie/theater_history|title= Guthrie website, History.  Accessed July 9, 2007|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070423175704/http://www.guthrietheater.org/about_the_guthrie/theater_history|archivedate= April 23, 2007|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Swanson&gt;{{cite book |last=Swanson |first=Walter |authorlink= |title=Minneapolis: City of Enterprise, Center of Excellence: A contemporary portrait |publisher=Windsor Publications, Inc  |date=1989 | page=94-95| isbn=0-89781-292-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Whiting, the director of the [[University of Minnesota]] Theater, introduced Guthrie to the arts community in the Twin Cities and helped gather support that persuaded Guthrie to locate his theater in [[Minneapolis]]. With the help of the newly founded Tyrone Guthrie Theater Foundation a fundraising effort raised over [[United States dollar|US$]]2 million. The new theater was completed in 1963 in time for the May 7 opening of ''Hamlet''. During its first season the Guthrie featured well known stage actors [[Hume Cronyn]], [[Jessica Tandy]] and [[Zoe Caldwell]] and featured a group of younger actors including [[George Grizzard]], [[Ellen Geer]] and [[Joan van Ark]]. Tyrone Guthrie served as [[Artistic Director]] until 1966 and continued to direct at the theater he founded until 1969, two years before his death. In 1966 [[Douglas Campbell (actor)|Douglas Campbell]] was named Artistic Director.

Throughout the 1960s the Guthrie found critical acclaim in its productions of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', ''[[Saint Joan (play)|St. Joan]]'', ''[[Caucasian Chalk Circle]]'', ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' and ''The House of Atreus''. In 1968 the production of ''The House of Atreus'' was taken on the road in a national tour that was a first for a resident theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.guthrietheater.org/INSIDETHEGUTHRIE/TheaterHistory/tabid/83/Default.aspx|title= Guthrie website / Theater History|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070106133409/http://www.guthrietheater.org/INSIDETHEGUTHRIE/TheaterHistory/tabid/83/Default.aspx|archivedate= 2007-01-06|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also starting in 1968, the Guthrie began a tradition of producing plays on smaller stages in the Twin Cities area, including the Crawford-Livingston Theater in St. Paul and The Other Place.

In 1971, [[Michael Langham]] became artistic director and produced classic plays including ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'', and ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]''. After Langham left in 1977, the Guthrie crossed a milestone of sorts when for the first time it selected an artistic director that was not a respected collaborator or friend of Tyrone Guthrie. That year Alvin Epstein was selected as artistic director and was the first American to fill that role.

In 1980 [[Liviu Ciulei]] replaced Epstein. Ciulei was the former artistic director of  [[Teatrul Bulandra]] in [[Romania]] and had a profound influence on the Guthrie. He challenged audiences with his bold theatrical interpretations and his highly contemporary and international style. Ciulei's interest in theater didn't stop at the productions themselves, he was a designer and architect and one of the first things he did was to redesign the theater itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9A0DE4DD1238F935A35754C0A960948260| title= Shaping a 'Dream' Far More Bitter Than Puckish, New York Times, 6 July 1986 (registration required) | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; His changes allowed more structural flexibility in the stage to allow each production a unique physical presentation. While Ciulei was not able to attain all the goals he had envisioned, he was able to maintain and advance the Guthrie's national and international reputation as a first-rate example of American theater and drew critical success with productions of classics such as ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', ''[[The Seagull]]'', and ''[[Tartuffe]]''. He also was able to reestablish the Guthrie’s commitment to acting ensembles by gathering together a rotating repertory in his last season as Artistic Director in 1985. In 1982 the theater won the [[Regional Theatre Tony Award]].

That year the Guthrie turned to Garland Wright, who had spent some time as Liviu Ciulei’s associate artistic director in the early 1980s as Ciulei's replacement. Wright had shared a vision with Ciulei that included the desire to have a second, smaller stage that could act as a lab to enable the exploration of new work and performance techniques. Born out of this vision was the Guthrie Laboratory (also known as the Guthrie Lab) located in the Minneapolis Warehouse District. Wright also shared a desire to keep the concept of a resident acting company alive and used his ensembles to great effect. He was able to combine critical and popular success with a series of productions that helped reestablish a large, enthusiastic and loyal audience base. Productions from this period include ''[[The Misanthrope]]'', ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', ''[[The Screens]]'', and a trilogy of ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', ''Henry IV'' ([[Henry IV, part 1|Parts I]] and [[Henry IV, part 2|II]]) and ''Henry V'', ''[[Medea]]'' and ''[[As You Like It]]''. Wright also created a series of outreach programs designed to garner interest in theater among young people and involving high school and colleague instructors.

Garland Wright announced his resignation in 1994 and after an international search for his successor, [[Joe Dowling]] was chosen as the Guthrie's seventh artistic director.  Dowling had gained an international reputation with his work at Ireland's national theater, the [[Abbey Theatre]], including becoming the Abbey's youngest artistic director in its long history.

Under Dowling's artistic leadership, the Guthrie has enjoyed unprecedented growth. Subscriptions are at an all-time high of more than 32,000, up more than 50% from the beginning of Dowling's tenure. Dowling's time at the Guthrie Theater has been marked by a return to regional touring, co-productions by visiting international theater companies (WorldStage Series), collaborations with local theater companies, and his own dynamic productions of the classics.

==Vineland Place==

Paired with an innovative philosophy that included a resident acting company with high professional standards was a unique design concept in the stage itself.

[[Ralph Rapson]] was selected to design the 1963 theater building. Rapson was a leading contributor to architecture's modern movement on the [[United States East Coast|East Coast]] from the late 1940s through the 1950s, and served as head of the [[University of Minnesota]] School of [[Architecture]] in the late 1950s.  Rapson had also worked on some preliminary sketches of the [[Walker Art Center]], which donated land on Vineland Place for the Guthrie's construction. Guthrie and Rapson selected a modified [[theater in the round]] design that featured a [[thrust stage]] projecting from a back wall with seating surrounding nearly two thirds of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/04guthrie.html| title=Ralph Rapson/Minnesota Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Walker Art Center-former Guthrie Theater-20081004.JPG|thumb|[[Walker Art Center]] site of the first Guthrie (green lawn at right in 2008)]]
The Guthrie's design arose out of Ralph Rapson's work with the Walker Art Center, and concepts the Walker was considering for a small auditorium near their museum. The result was a theater designed by Rapson, that seated 1,441 people when it first opened its doors in 1963. Its irregularly-shaped stage, designed by [[Tanya Moiseiwitsch]], had 7 sides and took up 1120 square feet (104 m²). Seating radiated outward and upward, and the ceiling was hung with acoustical panels that carried the asymmetrical theme to the top of the theater. The design concept encouraged the use of a minimal use of large set pieces. In 1974 the distinctive exterior screen, which had suffered from corrosion by the elements over the years, was removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docomomo-us.org/news/tyrone_guthrie_theater Hession, Jane King. “The Tyrone Guthrie Theater”.]  ''docomomo_us, International Committee for the Documentation and Conservation of Buildings, Sites and Neighborhoods of the Modern Movement''. January, 13, 2015.   &lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 Artistic Director Liviu Ciulei redesigned the stage. The stage itself was modified so that its size, shape and height was adjustable, and he opened up the back wall to create more depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.minnesotatwinstickets.com/venues/guthrie-theatre-tickets.php| title= Twins Tickets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] put the old Guthrie building on its list of the most endangered historic properties in the United States in response to plans announced by the [[Walker Art Center]] to expand on the land occupied by the theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/midwest-region/guthrie-theater.html | title=National Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, demolition started in late 2006 beginning with the common area between the old Guthrie building and the Walker. The site has been turned into green space and an extension of the [[Minneapolis Sculpture Garden]].

In 2006, the Guthrie finished construction of a new $125 million theater building along the [[Mississippi River]] in [[downtown]] Minneapolis. The design is the work of [[Jean Nouvel]], along with the Minneapolis architectural firm Architectural Alliance and is a 285,000 square foot (26,500 m²) facility that houses three theaters: (1) the theater's signature thrust stage, seating 1,100, (2) a 700-seat proscenium stage, and (3) a black-box studio with flexible seating. It also has a 178-foot cantilevered bridge (called the "Endless Bridge") to the Mississippi which is open to visitors during normal building hours. The outside of the building's walls are covered in large panels which display a large mural of photographs from past plays visible clearly at night. Jean Nouvel was in association with [[ducks scéno]] and [[Jacques Le Marquet]] for the scenography of the theaters and the acousticians of [[The Talaske Group]] and [[Kahle Acoustics]].

The first Guthrie production at the new location,''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (adapted for the stage by Simon Levy and directed by [[David Esbjornson]]), opened on July 15, 2006.

'''''Horton Hears a Who!''''' is a children's book written and illustrated by Theodor Seuss Geisel under the pen name [[Dr. Seuss]] and was published in 1954 by [[Random House]].

It is the second Dr. Seuss book to feature [[Horton the Elephant]], the first being ''[[Horton Hatches the Egg]]''. The Whos would later reappear in ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]''.

[[Miranda Richardson]] read the book as part of her second audio collection of Dr. Seuss books. The other three books she narrated were ''[[Oh, the Places You'll Go!]]'', ''[[Mr. Brown Can Moo! Can You?]]'', and ''[[Happy Birthday to You!]]''.

==Plot==
The book tells the story of [[Horton the Elephant]], who, while splashing in a pool, hears a small speck of dust talking to him. Horton surmises that a small person lives on the speck and places it on a clover, vowing to protect it. He later discovers that the speck is actually a tiny planet, home to a community called [[Whoville]], where microscopic creatures called Whos live. The Mayor of Whoville asks Horton to protect them from harm, which Horton happily agrees to, proclaiming throughout the book that "a person’s a person, no matter how small."

Throughout the book, Horton is trying to convince the Jungle of Nool that "A person is a person no matter how small" and that everyone should be treated equally. In his mission to protect the speck, Horton is ridiculed and harassed by the other animals in the jungle for believing in something they can't see or hear. He is first criticized by the sour [[kangaroo]] and her joey. The splash they make as they jump into the pool almost reaches the speck, so Horton decides to find somewhere safer for it. But the news of his odd new behavior spreads quickly, and he is soon harassed by a group of monkeys. They steal the clover from him and give it to Vlad Vladikoff, a black-bottomed eagle. Vlad flies the clover a long distance, with Horton in pursuit, until Vlad drops it into a field of clovers.

After a long search, Horton finally finds the clover with the speck on it. However, the Mayor informs him that Whoville, the town on the speck, is in bad shape from the fall, and Horton discovers that the sour kangaroo and the monkeys have caught up to him. They tie Horton up and threaten to boil the speck in a pot of "Beezle-Nut" oil. To save Whoville, Horton implores the little people to make as much noise as they can, to prove their existence. So almost everyone in Whoville shouts, sings, and plays instruments, but still no one but Horton can hear them. So the Mayor searches Whoville until he finds a very small shirker named JoJo, who is playing with a yo-yo instead of making noise. The Mayor carries him to the top of Eiffelberg Tower, where Jojo lets out a loud "Yopp!", which finally makes the kangaroo and the monkeys hear the Whos. Now convinced of the Whos' existence, the other jungle animals vow to help Horton protect the tiny community. 

==Background==
Geisel began work on ''Horton Hears a Who!'' in the fall of 1953. The book's main theme, "a person's a person no matter how small", was Geisel's reaction to his visit to Japan, where the importance of the individual was an exciting new concept.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan, pp.&amp;nbsp;144–145&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel, who had harbored strong [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States|anti-Japan sentiments]] before and during [[World War II]], changed his views dramatically after the war and used this book as an allegory for the [[Occupation of Japan|American post-war occupation of the country]].&lt;ref name="Goes to War"&gt;{{cite book |last=Minear |first=Richard H. |authorlink=Richard Minear |title=[[Dr. Seuss Goes to War]] |year=1999 |publisher=[[The New Press]] |location=[[New York, New York]] |isbn=1-56584-565-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He dedicated the book to a Japanese friend.

''Horton Hears a Who!'' is written in [[anapestic tetrameter]], like many other Dr. Seuss books.{{sfn|Fensch|2001|p=109}} Unlike some of his books, however, ''Horton'' contains a strong moral message, which Thomas Fensch identifies as "universal, multinational, multi-ethnic. In a word: Equality."{{sfn|Fensch|2001|p=110}} Fensch also contends that the Mayor of Whoville's lines, "When the black-bottomed birdie let go and we dropped,/ We landed so hard that our clocks have all stopped" is a reference to the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].{{sfn|Fensch|2001|p=110}}

==Adaptations in other media==

===Stage===
The story, along with ''[[Horton Hatches the Egg]]'', also provides the basic plot for the 2000 [[Broadway musical]] ''[[Seussical]]''.

===Television special===
''Horton Hears a Who!'' was adapted into a half-hour animated [[Horton Hears a Who! (TV special)|TV special]] by [[MGM Animation/Visual Arts]] in 1970, directed by [[Chuck Jones]] (who also directed the television version of ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]''), produced by [[Dr. Seuss|Theodor Geisel]], and with narration by [[Hans Conried]], who also voiced Horton. In this direction, the Sour Kangaroo's name is Jane, while her son is named Junior. Horton's contact in Whoville was not the Mayor, but a scientist named Dr. Hoovie (also voiced by [[Hans Conried]]).  Jane was voiced by [[June Foray]]. In Russia, [[Alexei Karayev]] directed ''I Can Hear You'' in 1992, a 19-minute [[paint-on-glass animation|paint-on-glass-animated]] film which is based on the [[Russian language|Russian]] translation of Seuss's poetry but features a very different visual style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animator.ru/db/?ver=eng&amp;p=show_film&amp;fid=4811 |title=Russian animation |publisher=Animator.ru |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===

'''Impalement arts''' are a type of [[performing art]] in which a performer plays the role of human target for a fellow performer who demonstrates accuracy skills in disciplines such as knife throwing and archery. [[Impalement]] is actually what the performers endeavour to avoid – the thrower or marksman aims ''near'' the target rather than at him or her. The objective is to land the throw or shot as close as possible to the assistant's body without causing injury.

Impalement arts are often found in [[circuses]] and [[sideshow]]s as well as sometimes in [[Variety shows|variety]], [[cabaret]] or [[burlesque]] shows. In addition, impalement acts have provided subject matter for literature, art, photography and film and television scripts.

There are important distinctions between [[knife throwing]] or [[archery]] practised as competitive sports and similar skills displayed as impalement arts. For example, organising bodies for competitive archery prohibit activity that involves deliberate shooting in the general direction of a human being.&lt;ref&gt;For example, impalement arts contravene rules 101(b) and 102(a) of the UK Grand National Archery Society (GNAS) Rules of Shooting (see {{cite web

}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms and variations==

The human target is the essential distinguishing feature of the impalement arts. It has been asserted by several sources, including well-known knife throwers, that the power and appeal of this type of act lies as much in audience appreciation of the target as in admiration of the skill of the thrower or archer.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Dr David Adamovich, aka The Great Throwdini, has frequently asserted the importance of his assistants in print and in web forums. In Adamovich, Heil &amp; Schollenberger, ''A Day on Broadway: The art of being a knife thrower's assistant'', Turnshare (London, 2005), {{ISBN|1-903343-73-9}}, p.150, he writes of: "...my lovely and daring assistants - sine qua non - without which there'd be no act!". In the same book Astrid Schollenberger describes her initial instruction by Adamovich thus: "Rule one: The target girl is the star of the show and she has to be aware that the stunts depend on her. Rule two: You must not move".&lt;/ref&gt; Various theories have been put forward to explain this, ranging from simple awe at the display of steely nerves and complete trust to more complex psychological and philosophical theories. While some point to overtones of [[BDSM|sadomasochistic]] [[eroticism]], others cite [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] works and point to parallels with the story arc of the [[hero]] in classic drama. In particular the assistant's performance is said to mirror the plot device of the [[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers|hero's ordeal]], in which the hero proves his or her heroic qualities through self-sacrifice or by facing extreme peril.&lt;ref name="Heil"&gt;Dr Joachim Heil PhD, "A short philosophical essay on the art of knife throwing", in Adamovich, Heil &amp; Schollenberger, ''A Day on Broadway'', pp.83–114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Extensive evidence of the debate on this topic is to be found in various online forums including the ''Dangerous Circus Acts'' groups on Yahoo!&lt;/ref&gt;

The target or assistant role is most often taken by a female performer,  sometimes known as a [[target girl]], who commonly wears a revealing costume, thus adding an element of overt sexuality to the act. While a few contemporary acts feature a male in the target role, and some play upon role reversal, the traditional figure of a female target still prevails.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Brion in the foreword to ''A Day on Broadway'', p.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, the assistant, whether male or female, stands in front of a board, made of wood or some similar material, into which the knives or arrows are embedded. For some stunts the assistant is strapped to a moving board. There are several disciplines and a great variety of tricks and stunts that are performed within this basic format. Some tricks are done by performers in all disciplines while others are generally the preserve of one discipline. For example, moving target stunts, such as the "[[Wheel of death (Impalement arts)|wheel of death]]", tend to be done by knife throwers but not by archers.

Impalement artists have adopted a variety of guises, including [[Wild West Shows|wild west]] figures, "gypsy" characters or tuxedo-wearing [[cabaret]] performers. There have even been efforts to package impalement arts within dramatic productions, such as the play ''Pin Cushion'', which consists of a monologue delivered by an actress as she takes part in a real knifethrowing act (see [[#Theatre|Theatre]]).&lt;ref name="httheatre"&gt;For official website see {{cite web

===Disciplines===
The impalement arts can be divided into distinct disciplines. While some performers specialise purely in one of the disciplines, others combine disciplines or even mix impalement arts into other types of performance.
* '''[[Knife throwing]]''' is the most common and well-known discipline within the impalement arts. It includes the throwing of axes, machetes and other sharp implements as well as knives.
* '''[[Archery]]''' is the other main discipline. An archer might use bows or crossbows or both.
* '''Sharpshooting:''' It is arguable that some firearms sharpshooting acts fall into the category of impalement arts when they involve a performer holding up targets for a [[marksman]]. Even when sharpshooting is not performed as an impalement art, it is sometimes grouped alongside knife throwing as a [[Wild West Shows|wild west]] art. It also has much in common with crossbow shooting in terms of the accuracy skills involved.
* '''Whips and other disciplines:''' Disciplines such as [[bullwhip]] displays and trick roping are not strictly impalement arts but are often grouped with impalement art disciplines for a variety of reasons. Bullwhip artists and ropers sometimes employ human "targets" for certain tricks. Furthermore, some impalement arts performers also feature these other disciplines in their acts. In addition, all the above disciplines are sometimes placed within a common context, such as [[Wild West Shows|wild west]] arts.

===Tricks===
There are many variations on the simple arrangement of having the assistant stand in front of a target board and remain still while knives, arrows or other objects land about them. Often the first type of variation in a routine is that the assistant will assume different poses. For example:
[[File:Target-girl Astrid performs profile stunt.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Astrid Schollenberger demonstrates the position of the target girl in the "profile" stunt.]]
* '''Profile:'''  This is a classic done by many performers. The assistant stands side-on to the board and then bends backwards. The impalement artist then aims a series of knives, axes or arrows along the line of the front edge of the assistant, beginning around the legs and ending with the last throw or shot coming close to the assistant's throat. One aspect of this pose is that it accentuates the vulnerability of the assistant, particularly with the last impact tantalisingly close to the throat. Another important aspect for knifethrowers is that the upper part of the assistant's body is positioned so that a series of throws can be landed ''above'' it - a flexible target girl might be able to place her neck and the upper part of her chest in a horizontal line. A skilled thrower can use the way that a knife turns in flight to land it sloping at a downward angle from the board; thus, the point of the knife can impact safely above the assistant but the rest of the knife can slope down and come very close indeed to the assistant's body, even making contact on some occasions.
* '''Headstand:''' An example from the repertoire of knife acts goes as follows: The assistant does a headstand against the target board; the thrower then throws two knives or axes, one into each of the two top corners of the target board; the assistant moves his or her legs apart until they touch the two implements embedded in the board; the thrower then throws a series of implements into the "V" formed by the assistants legs, progressing threateningly towards the crotch.

More complex stunts and challenges include:
* '''[[Wheel of death (Impalement arts)|The Wheel of death]]:''' One of the most difficult and dangerous feats for a knifethrower. The assistant is strapped to a large circular target board which spins about its middle, like a wheel. The thrower must execute a series of rapid, consistent and carefully timed throws to land knives on the segments of the wheel not covered by the assistant's body. There are some variations in the exact configuration of "wheels": in some the assistant is positioned with their arms at their sides while in others the assistant is [[spreadeagle (position)|spreadeagled]]. Sometimes the "wheel" might not actually be circular: shield shapes and rectangular rotating boards have been known and all will work as "wheels" as long as they are correctly balanced to rotate smoothly when the assistant is in place.&lt;ref name="blade-aug93"&gt;{{Cite journal

 |pages = 30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly challenging version of this stunt is "The Veiled Wheel", in which the target is covered with a paper screen so the thrower can't see the assistant. Only four artists are known to have attempted this dangerous trick. It was first performed by The Gibsons in the 1930s; a duo named The Zeros followed them in the 1940s, Fritz Brumbach did it in Monte Carlo in 1978 and The Great Throwdini revived it in New York in October 2010 with Melissa-Anne Ainley acting as his target girl.&lt;ref name="hartzman_aol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aolnews.com/weird-news/article/throwdini-makes-wheel-of-death-even-deadlier/19659035 |title=Wheel of Death Made Deadlier |accessdate=2010-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011194355/http://www.aolnews.com/weird-news/article/throwdini-makes-wheel-of-death-even-deadlier/19659035 |archivedate=October 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Devil's door:''' A moving target challenge pioneered by knifethrower [[#Knife throwing|Larry Cisewski]]. This time the assistant is on a door-sized rectangular board that spins about a central vertical axis. Again the thrower must execute a series of rapid, consistent and carefully timed throws to land knives on parts of the board not covered by the assistant's body. Sometimes the aim is to hit the back of the board in the moments that the assistant is turned away from the thrower. Other throwers have placed a vertical row of knives down the sides of the assistant at the moments when the assistant turns to face them.&lt;ref name="cisewskiMcEvoy"/&gt;
* '''Balloon bursting:''' The assistant stands in front of the target board and holds balloons which the thrower or archer then attempts to burst. Balloons can be held in the hand, positioned under arms or between the legs and sometimes an assistant will hold a balloon between their teeth.
* '''William Tell:''' There are various stunts inspired by the story of [[William Tell]], who, according to legend, was forced to shoot an apple off of his son's head with a crossbow. Modern impalement artists have performed similar feats. In some ways the Tell legend can be seen as one of the earliest inspirations for the impalement arts.
* '''Impaling a card or paper plate:''' The assistant stands in front of the target board and holds out a card, or paper plate which the thrower or archer attempts to pin to the board. The level of danger can be varied to some extent by whether the assistant holds the card at full arms length or keeps it close. [[#Archery and crossbow acts|The Jasters]] do a "William Tell" version in which the card is balanced on the head of target girl Elena Busnelli.
* '''Cutting a straw or flower stem:''' An assistant holds a [[Drinking straw|straw]] or flower in his or her mouth and the impalement artist attempts to chop the tip of it off. This is mostly associated with knife throwers and bullwhip artists.
* '''Blind:''' The thrower or archer wears a [[blindfold]]. Generally the assistant first guides the blindfolded impalement artist into position facing towards the target board. The assistant then stands in place against the board and gives an audible signal to commence the stunt. The implication is that the impalement artist then has to aim on the basis of where they remember the target to be. There is a trick behind this stunt and budding impalement artists are warned not to attempt it unless coached by an experienced professional.
* '''Covered target:''' The assistant is covered so that the thrower or archer cannot see exactly where they are. The covering is made of paper or some other flimsy material so that knives or arrows will pass through it. The implication is that the thrower or archer must estimate the position of the assistant using memory and other indirect guides and aim on that basis.
* '''Double ladder of death:''' This involves two knifethrowers simultaneously performing a rapid sequence of throws at the same target board while aiming so that the trajectories of their knives cross. The throwers stand side by side facing the assistant at the board. The knives from the thrower on the right land on the left side of the target board while the knives from the thrower on the left impact to the right. Each thrower aims their next knife vertically above where they placed the preceding one, so that a ladder of knives is formed up each side of the assistant. This stunt was pioneered by [[#Knife throwing|The Great Throwdini]] in partnership with [[#Knife throwing|Harry Munroe]].&lt;ref name="cirkus"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 2007-02-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Vegetable slice:''' A cucumber (or similar vegetable) is held on the bare skin of the assistant's body (usually the inside of her forearm).  A series of knives are thrown around the assistant, ending with a knife that slices the cucumber in half.  This stunt was performed by [[Jack Dagger]] on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]'s ''More Extreme Marksmen'' and ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]''.

==History==
The precise origins of the impalement arts remain unknown, but its performance may reach back as far as antiquity. The [[Roman emperor]] [[Domitian]] (1st century AD) was said to entertain guests on his [[Alba Longa|Alban]] estate with virtuoso displays of marksmanship.&lt;ref name="suetonius-domitian-19"&gt;Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#19 19]&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Suetonius]] reported these acts in his biography of the emperor:

{{quote|text=There are many who have more than once seen [Domitian] slay a hundred wild beasts of different kinds on his Alban estate, and purposely kill some of them with two successive shots in such a way that the arrows gave the effect of horns. Sometimes he would have a slave stand at a distance and hold out the palm of his right hand for a mark, with the fingers spread; then he directed his arrows with such accuracy that they passed harmlessly between the fingers..&lt;br&gt;
:[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|De Vita Caesarum]]'', "Life of Domitian", 19}}

Knife throwing performers are known to have performed in Europe and America in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Brion in the foreword to ''A Day on Broadway'', p.vii&lt;/ref&gt; with recorded uses of the term "impalement" to describe this type of act as early as 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}} (excerpts published on the internet by the Circus Historical Society)&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of the impalement arts was greatly facilitated by the way that [[circus]] developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and in particular by American influences. [[Buffalo Bill]]'s performances in Europe in 1887 resulted in a wave of popularity for [[Wild West Shows|wild west shows]] and the "western arts" they involved, including knife throwing, archery, whip cracking and sharp shooting.&lt;ref&gt;Brion, ''A Day on Broadway'', p.viii&lt;/ref&gt; In the circus world, the success of large-scale tented touring shows pioneered in America led to the introduction of more acts of skill and daring as well as the inclusion of [[sideshow]]s, in which impalement acts sometimes featured. Among the most significant events were [[Barnum and Bailey Circus|Barnum &amp; Bailey's]] tours of Europe from 1897 to 1902, which made a huge impact on European circus owners and led them to adopt similar formats. As well as providing a friendly stage where impalement acts could rely on finding an audience, circus was a competitive environment in which shows and performers sought to out do each other and thus there were incentives to develop new stunts. Moving targets were an innovation used by European artists in the 1930s. A notable example is the Wheel of Death, which is recorded as having been introduced into the US in 1938 by The Gibsons, from Germany.&lt;ref name="blade-aug93"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'' p.ix&lt;/ref&gt;

Another trend in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was that acts from circuses began to find work in permanent venues that were developing in rapidly growing towns and cities. In the US they found a place in [[vaudeville]] and [[Burlesque|burlesque shows]]. In Britain the equivalent was [[music hall]]. And in both America and Europe, [[cabaret]] was another format that sometimes embraced impalement artists. The advent of cinema and later television in the 20th century eventually led to a gradual decline in the venues in which the impalement arts had previously thrived, but a new home was created in the form of [[variety shows|television variety shows]]. A knife throwing act was one of the first pieces of entertainment ever broadcast on television. When the [[BBC]] started the world's first practical television service with experimental transmissions in 1936 one of the types of programmes it produced were variety shows with circus artists. Those acts, which included the knife throwing Denvers, were thought to be very visual and thus suited to the new medium.&lt;ref name="apts"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variety later became an important part of primetime schedules and remained so for decades.

Although television variety shows are no longer the central feature of network television that they once were, the acts they harboured have found new outlets. The impalement arts live on in modern versions of circus and burlesque and still manage to find an occasional broadcast showcase. An example of this is the recent trend for talent competitions styled on a "[[reality TV]]"  format, such as ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', which featured knifethrowing in its 2007 run.

==Myths==
[[File:Target-girl Astrid with knife in flight.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Astrid Schollenberger in rehearsal faces the knives for real. One is captured in flight, fractions of a second before impact.]]
It is occasionally alleged that knife throwing acts are actually a trick in which the thrower palms the knife as he pretends to throw it and a knife springs out from the target, giving the illusion of perfect aim. Although this technique has been used by at least one magician to emulate knife throwing, the great majority of knife throwers perform genuine acts.&lt;ref&gt;A magician who demonstrated the fake knives trick was [[Val Valentino]] in the TV series ''Breaking the Magicians' Code: Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed ''. See also [[knife throwing]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are secret tricks behind certain stunts, such as throwing while blindfolded, but they do not involve fake knives springing from the target board.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Injuries suffered by performers provide evidence of the genuine nature of the impalement acts in question. Examples include the cases of Yana Rodionova, injured in a televised stunt with knife thrower Jayde Hanson, and French target girl Catherine Jamet, of Duo Grey Arrow, who suffered a near fatal wound during a crossbow act at the World Circus Festival in Paris in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Notable artists==
The impalement arts have evolved as the product of a history of performance dating back to at least the 19th century. That heritage, and especially the collective achievements of notable performers, helps to define the subject. As with other performance arts, judgements about who might be the most notable are highly subjective and clouded by the hyperbole of publicity. For similar reasons it is also sometimes difficult to resolve debates about who originated particular stunts. Nevertheless, some names recur frequently in historical records and current news. Some are recognised for pioneering achievements, some for bringing the arts to widespread audiences and some as distinctive characters who, although less famous, have had significant influence on their peers. Because this is not a league table of merit and because overlaps make a chronological presentation awkward, they are presented here in alphabetic order under the two main disciplines.

==Fictional or artistic representations==
The impalement arts have been featured in movies, television, literature and art.  These representations, rather than real acts, will have provided many people with the main basis of their ideas about the impalement arts. Impalement acts have proved to be useful plot devices and have provided iconic images. The following sections provide some examples by way of illustration.

===Movies and television===
Perhaps the most notable movie example is the French film ''[[Girl on the Bridge]]'' (1999), in which a knife throwing act is at the centre of the plot and serves as a powerful erotic metaphor. [[Vanessa Paradis]] stars as Adele, a girl who attempts suicide by jumping from a bridge but is saved by knife thrower Gabor, played by [[Daniel Auteuil]], who persuades her to become his target girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0144201|title=Girl on the Bridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other examples include:
* In episode six of ''[[American Horror Story: Freak Show]]'', "Bullseye" (November 2014), character Elsa Mars ([[Jessica Lange]]) throws knives at Paul 'The Illustrated Seal' ([[Mat Fraser]]) as he spins on a wheel of death. 
* The fourth season of the television series ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', featured an episode (first aired in 2009) in which title character [[Temperance "Bones" Brennan]] goes undercover as a target girl with Special Agent [[Seeley Booth]] as a knife-thrower.
* The film ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' (2002) features a confrontation between the main protagonists in which [[Cameron Diaz]]'s character Jenny Everdeane acts as a target girl in an impromptu knifethrowing act with the villain, Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting, played by [[Daniel Day-Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0217505|title=Gangs of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the television series ''[[Nikki (TV series)|Nikki]]'', the episode titled "The Jupiter and Mary Chain", first aired in 2001, featured the characters played by [[Nikki Cox]] and [[Susan Egan]] taking jobs as target girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Actress [[Goldie Hawn]] appeared in a circus costume strapped to a "wheel of death" target for a magazine photoshoot in the 1990s.
* The cover of ''[[Stick It to Ya]]'', the debut album by heavy metal band [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]], was infamous for a picture by photographer [[Glen Wexler]] of former ''[[Playboy]]'' playmate [[Laurie Carr]] wearing a swimsuit, strapped to a target board and surrounded by knives. The cover of a subsequent release, ''[[Stick It Live]]'', featured an image apparently from the same shoot as the first but this time showing the target girl walking towards the board hand-in-hand with a knife thrower.
* The picture ''Le Lanceur De Couteaux'' ("The Knife Thrower") painted in 1943 by [[Henri Matisse]] (1869&amp;ndash;1954) is an abstract image in which it is possible to discern representations of a thrower and an assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* The well-known [[Playmobil]] range of toys, marketed at children aged between six and twelve, once included two different sets featuring figures of a knife thrower and assistant. The ''Knifethrowing circus act'' set, which was retailed from 1978 until 1982, consisted of a target girl on a rotating "[[Wheel of death (Impalement arts)|wheel of death]]" and a knife thrower, both dressed in "wild west" type costumes. The ''Circus Performers'' set, released in June 1982 and discontinued in 1987, also contained a similar knife thrower and assistant with a wheel of death target, but their costumes were different and there were three other figures in the set.&lt;ref name="collectobil3545"&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:EAN-13-ISMN-13.png|thumb|300px|A 13-digit ISMN, 979-0-2600-0043-8, as  represented by an [[European Article Number|EAN-13 bar code]].]]
The '''International Standard Music Number''' or '''ISMN''' ('''ISO 10957''') is a thirteen-character alphanumeric [[identifier]] for [[printed music]] developed by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]. 

==Overview==
The original proposal for an ISMN was made by the UK Branch of [[International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres|IAML (International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres)]], put forward by Alan Pope (Blackwell's Music Department, Oxford), Malcolm Lewis (music librarian in Nottingham) and Malcolm Jones (music librarian in Birmingham).  A draft ISMN structure and application was presented at the 1987 IAML conference in Amsterdam, then after further discussions at the 1989 IAML conference in Oxford it was decided that the UK, French and German branches should, through their respective national standards bodies (BSI, AFNOR and DIN) file ISMN as an ISO work project.  After meetings in Ottawa and Paris in 1993 the draft was finalized and published by ISO.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = ISMN International | title = Newsletter | number = 10 | contribution = IAML | url = http://www.ismn-international.org/publications/newsletter10/iaml.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original format comprised four elements: a distinguishing prefix M, a publisher ID, an item ID, and a check digit, typically looking like M-2306-7118-7.  From 1 January 2008 the ISMN was defined as a thirteen digit identifier beginning 979-0 where the zero replaced M in the old-style number.  The resulting number is identical with its EAN-13 number as encoded in the item's barcode.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = ISMN International | url = http://www.ismn-international.org/whatis.html | title = What is}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current format comprises four blocks: the prefix ''979-0'' reserved for ISMNs — at some future date they are expected to occupy the remainder of the 979 space which is shared with [[ISBN]]s, a block to identify the publisher, another to identify the item and one final check digit. The [[TC 46/SC 9]] is responsible for the standard.

A publication may be assigned both an ISBN and an ISMN. Unlike the ISBN, the ISMN does not segregate publishers by country.

==Check digit==
To calculate the check digit, each digit of the ISMN is multiplied by a weight, alternating 1 and 3 left to right. These weighted digits are added together. The check digit is the integer between 0 and 9 that makes the sum a multiple of 10.

===Examples===
For instance, for the item with ISMN beginning 979-0-060-11561:
: 1x9 + 3x7 + 1x9 + 3x0 + 1x0 + 3x6 + 1x0 + 3x1 + 1x1 + 3x5 + 1x6 + 3x1 
: = 9  +  21 +  9  +  0  +  0  +  18 +  0  +  3  +  1  +  15 +  6  +  3  
: =  85
As 85 mod 10 = 5, the check digit is 10 - 5 = 5 and the full number is 979-0-060-11561-5.

For another example, [[Robert Fripp]]'s collection of [[Guitar&amp;nbsp;Craft]] scores has the ISMN 979-0-9016791-7-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fripp|2011|p=2}}:&lt;p&gt;
{{cite book|last=Fripp|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Fripp|title=Seven Guitar&amp;nbsp;Craft themes: Definitive scores for guitar ensemble|publisher=Partitas Music|year=2011|editor-first=Horacio|editor-last=Pozzo|url=http://partitasmusic.com/ |id=&lt;!-- [[International Standard Music Number| --&gt;ISMN&lt;!-- ]] --&gt;&amp;nbsp;979-0-9016791-7-7. [[Discipline Global Mobile|DGM]]&amp;nbsp;[[Stock-keeping unit|Sku]]&amp;nbsp;partitas001 | edition=First limited |others="Original transcriptions by Curt Golden", "Layout scores and tablatures: Ariel Rzezak and Theo Morresi"|ref=harv}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Given first 12 digits 979-0-9016791-7, the ISMN algorithm evaluates  
: 1x9 + 3x7 + 1x9 + 3x0 + 1x9 + 3x0 + 1x1 + 3x1 + 1x6 + 3x7 + 1x9 + 3x1 
: =  9  +  21  +  9    +  0    +  9    +  0    +  1    +  3    +  6    +  21  + 9     +     3  
: = 123
which implies that the check digit is indeed 7 (because 123+7=130=13x10).

'''Julia Crawford Ivers''' (October 3, 1869&lt;!-- Some sources erroneously cite 1867 --&gt; – May 8, 1930) was an American motion picture pioneer.&lt;ref name="WFPP-Julia"&gt;{{cite web

==Biography==
Born in [[Boonville, Missouri]], in 1869, her family arrived a year later in Los Angeles. Her father was a dentist. Her mother died in 1876, when Julia was seven years old. Julia's sister, Grace, died at age 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aimesley.blogspot.com/2009/04/more-about-julia-crawford-ivers.html|title=Genealogy Detective: More about Julia Crawford Ivers|website=Aimesley.blogspot.com|date=2009-04-29|accessdate=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivers watched the film industry come into existence and establish itself in southern California. She participated in the new industry as writer, producer and director.

She and her husband, Franklin S. Van Trees (aka Frank Van Trees 1866-1914), a famed "society" architect best known for his mansions in the [[Pacific Heights, San Francisco|Pacific Heights]] area of [[San Francisco]], had a son, [[James Van Trees]] (1890–1973), who became a popular [[cinematographer]] for Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. and shot some of his mother's films. Ivers later worked with director [[William Desmond Taylor]] and was reportedly a part of his inner circle before his murder. Her extremely wealthy second husband was Oliver Ivers (who died in 1902, two years after their marriage).&lt;ref name="WFPP-Julia" /&gt;

==Death==
Julia Crawford Ivers died in Los Angeles in 1930, aged 60, from stomach cancer.&lt;ref name="WFPP-Julia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmovie.com/artist/julia-crawford-ivers-185273|title=Julia Crawford Ivers - Biography, Movie Highlights and Photos|publisher=[[AllMovie]]|accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Living Still Life''''' (French: '''''Nature Morte Vivante'''''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'')'' is a painting by the artist [[Salvador Dalí]]. Dali painted this piece during a period that he called “Nuclear Mysticism.”&lt;ref&gt;'"Nature Morte Vivante (Still Life – Fast Moving)," Unparalled Collections of Salvador Dali Art Works, theDali.org., 13 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear Mysticism is composed of different theories that try to show the relationships between [[quantum physics]] and the conscious mind. The different theories are composed of elements that range from “Catalan philosophers” to “[[classicism]], [[pop art]], and [[nuclear physics]].”&lt;ref&gt;Baden, E., "Dali, Salvador. Salvador Dali: The Late Work," CHOICE: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries, (2011), 1070.&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting, done in 1956, currently resides at the [[Salvador Dali Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].

The name ''Nature Morte Vivante'' translates in English to “living still life.” It comes from the French translation “nature morte” which directly translates to “dead nature.” By adding “vivante,” which implies “fast moving action and a certain lively quality,” onto the end of that, Dali was essentially naming this piece “dead nature in movement.”&lt;ref&gt;Joan Kropf, “Salvador Dali: The Atomic Period,” UMI Dissertation publishing, (2000), 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  This plays into his theme of Nuclear Mysticism which combined elements of art, physics, and science. The theory, as well as the term, “Nuclear Mysticism” was coined by Dali himself. In the late 1940s and early 1950s Dali started to “return to his [[Catholicism|Catholic]] roots following [[World War II]].”&lt;ref&gt;"Nuclear Mysticism: Salvador Dali.” Tufts University, n.d. Web. 13 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear mysticism is composed of different theories by Dali that combine science, physics, math, and art. Post WWII, Dali became fascinated by the [[atom]]. Dali stated that after the U.S. dropped the first atomic bomb in [[Japan]] that it “shook me [Dali] seismically” and that the atom was his “favorite food for thought.”&lt;ref&gt;Joan Kropf, “Salvador Dali: The Atomic Period,” 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dali saw the beauty of the atom and was interested in the how the atom makes up everything. In this painting, Dali wanted to show the motion that all objects have, that although an object is still, it is always full of millions of atoms that are constantly in motion. He portrays this thought throughout his painting. Every object in the painting is moving in some direction, one that an object of that type normally does not do. Dali was also obsessed with the spiral, which he thought to be “the most important feature in nature”, and used it as “a symbol of cosmic order.”&lt;ref&gt;The Dali Museum, “Nature Morte Vivante.”&lt;/ref&gt;   Dali portrayed this idea by adding a spiral in the top right corner of his painting. Not only does Dali portray his objects flying around the scene, he shows them twisted in usual ways. For example, the silver bowl is not only shown mid-air, but also twisted in an unnatural way for silver to bend. Dali also infused religious elements of Nuclear Mysticism into this painting. On the table with the white tablecloth, the objects placed closest to the table and that appear to be the least in motion are a glass of wine, two grapes, a pear, a glass bottle with water pouring out, and what appears to be a fig leaf. The fig leaf has long been a religious symbol associated with [[Christianity]]. In the Bible, [[Adam and Eve]] use fig leaves to cover themselves after their deception in the [[Garden of Eden]]. The placement of the fig leaf in Dali’s painting could allude to his reemergence back into Catholicism.

Dali took inspiration from [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Floris Van Schooten]] and his painting ''Table with Food'' for his own painting ''Nature Morte Vivante''.&lt;ref&gt;Kropf, “Salvador Dali: The Atomic Period,” 53.&lt;/ref&gt;  Van Schooten’s painting, which was a very common type of painting for its time, was a very typical still life that depicted food and drinks on a table with a crisp white tablecloth. Dali wanted to give his own take on it, and give it his [[surrealist]] signature by showing all of the objects in motion. He also added the tablecloth, which looks very similar to tablecloths that Schooten had used throughout his own paintings. Even though most of the objects Dali portrays are ordinary things, he puts a spin, literally and figuratively, on the motion and placement of the objects. The disarray of the objects alludes to his interest in nuclear mysticism. He believed that “all matter was not at all like it seemed, but instead had attributes that even he was only able to guess.” He wanted to enforce that “that all objects are made of atomic particles in constant motion,” which he portrays through the scattered items.&lt;ref&gt;Felks, P,. and P. Paul. “Analysis of “Nature Morte Vivante, 1956.” Salvador Dali Art Gallery, n.d. Web. 13 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  He painted the still life objects to move in a life of his own, without the complacency of a typical still life.

	''Nature Morte Vivante'' is arguably the most “Dali-esque” painting he has done. He took something as simple and universal as a still life, which artists have been creating and recreating for thousands of years, and put his signature style on it. This painting perfectly captures his theory of nuclear mysticism, and helps to bring it to life and give the public a visual of his theory, Nuclear Mysticism.

'''Masterpiece''', '''''magnum opus''''' ([[Latin]], ''great work'') or '''''chef-d’œuvre''''' ([[French language|French]], ''master of work'', plural ''chefs-d’œuvre'') in modern use is a creation that has been given much critical praise, especially one that is considered the greatest work of a person's career or to a work of outstanding creativity, skill, profundity, or workmanship. Historically, a "masterpiece" was a work of a very high standard produced to obtain membership of a guild or academy in various areas of the visual arts and crafts.
[[File:Zuccari Two painter's apprentices.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Federico Zuccari]], ''Two Painter's Apprentices'', 1609. They would have to produce a ''masterpiece'' to become masters at the end of their apprenticeships.]]

==Etymology==
The form ''masterstik'' is recorded in English or [[Scots language|Scots]] in a set of [[Aberdeen]] guild regulations dated to 1579, whereas "masterpiece" is first found in 1605, already outside a guild context, in a [[Ben Jonson]] play.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]:"Masterpiece". See also: [http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861628683/masterpiece.html Encarta]. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kx5TnWWs?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861628683/masterpiece.html Archived] 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Masterprize" was another early variant in English.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]:"Masterprize"&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, the term rapidly became used in a variety of contexts for an exceptionally good piece of creative work, and was "in early use, often applied to man as the 'masterpiece' of God or Nature".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], and examples&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally, the term ''masterpiece'' referred to a piece of work produced by an [[apprentice]] or [[journeyman]] aspiring to become a [[master craftsman]] in the old European [[guild]] system. His fitness to qualify for guild membership was judged partly by the masterpiece, and if he was successful, the piece was retained by the guild. Great care was therefore taken to produce a fine piece in whatever the craft was, whether confectionery, [[painting]], [[goldsmith]]ing, [[Knife making|knifemaking]], or many other trades.

In [[Kingdom of England|England]], in the 17th century, the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]], for instance, required an apprentice to produce a masterpiece under their supervision at a "workhouse" in [[Goldsmiths' Hall]]. The workhouse had been set up as part of a tightening of standards after the company became concerned that the level of skill of goldsmithing was being diluted. The wardens of the company had complained in 1607 that the "true practise of the Art &amp; Mystery of Goldsmithry is not only grown into great decays but also dispersed into many parts, so as now very few workmen are able to finish &amp; perfect a piece of plate singularly with all the garnishings &amp; parts thereof without the help of many &amp; several hands...". The same goldsmithing organization still requires the production of a masterpiece but it is no longer produced under supervision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegoldsmiths.co.uk/library/archives/a-history-of-the-goldsmiths%27-company/ ''A History of the Goldsmiths' Company.''] The Goldsmiths' Company. Retrieved 30 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldsmiths-centre.org/professional-training/goldsmiths-company-apprenticeship-programme/ Goldsmiths' Company Apprenticeship Programme.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20141230121155/http://www.goldsmiths-centre.org/professional-training/goldsmiths-company-apprenticeship-programme/ |date=2014-12-30 }} The Goldsmiths' Centre. Retrieved 30 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nuremberg, Germany, between 1531 and 1572, apprentices who wished to become master goldsmith were required to produce [[columbine cup]]s, dice for a steel seal, and gold rings set with precious stones before they could be admitted to the goldsmiths' guild. If they failed to be admitted, then they could continue to work for other goldsmiths but not as a master themselves. In some guilds, apprentices were not allowed to marry until they had obtained full membership.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O91876/cup-jamnitzer-wenzel/ Cup, Silver, room 69, case 25.] Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. Retrieved 30 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of producing a masterpiece has continued in some modern academies of art, where the general term for such works is now [[reception piece]]. The [[Royal Academy]] in London uses the term "[[diploma work]]" and it has acquired a fine collection of diploma works received as a condition of membership.

The '''Museo de la Estampa''' (Museum of Graphic Arts) is a museum in [[Mexico City]], dedicated to the history, preservation and promotion of Mexican graphic arts. The word “estampa” means “engraving” or “printing” refers to works which have the quality of being reproducible and include seals, [[woodcuts]], [[lithography]] and others.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://travel.latimes.com/destinations/mexico/mexico-city/attractions/museo-nacional-de-la-estampa/review |title= Museo Nacional de la Estampa |publisher=Los Angeles Times |location=Los Angeles, CA |accessdate=March 4, 2010 | first=- | last=Frommer's}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bellasartes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellasartes.gob.mx/INBA/Template12/index.jsp?secc_cve=180 |title=Presentación |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |accessdate=March 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006202327/http://www.bellasartes.gob.mx/INBA/Template12/index.jsp?secc_cve=180 |archivedate=October 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was created in 1986 and located in a 19th-century [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical building]] located in the [[Santa Veracruz Church, Mexico City|Plaza de Santa Veracruz]] in the [[historic center of Mexico City|historic center]] of the city. This building was remodeled both to house the museum and to conserve its original look.&lt;ref name="mexdes"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/2998-Museo-Nacional-de-la-Estampa-(D.F.) |title= Museo Nacional de la Estampa (D.F.)  |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |accessdate=March 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Posada2.Catrina.jpeg|thumb|left|Image of "La Catrina".]]
The building houses both a permanent and multiple temporary exhibits. The permanent collection includes pre-Hispanic clay seals used for printing designs on fabrics, ceramics and other surfaces, printed material from the colonial period and more recent creations.  More recent works are divided into periods such as the “age of the [[San Carlos Academy]]” (18th -19th century) and the “resurgence of the graphics arts” which covered the decades from the 1920s to the 1960s. The best-known works here are those of [[José Guadalupe Posada]], the creator of “[[La Catrina]]” and numerous satirical comics. It also includes video programs on graphic techniques such as wood cuts, etchings and more.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt;

The museum works in collaboration with [[Museo Nacional de Arte]], which holds Mexico’s largest collection of graphic arts including those done by Mexican artists José Guadalupe Posada, [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], as well as foreign artists such as [[Mario Benedetti]] and [[Ilya Kabakov]].&lt;ref name="bellasartes"/&gt; This collection is called the National Collection of Graphic Works (Colección Nacional de Estampas).&lt;ref name="conaculta"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arts-history.mx/banco/index.php?id_nota=04012010154159 |title=) El Museo Nacional de la Estampa resguarda el acervo más amplio de estampa en México |author=[[CONACULTA]] |publisher=Artes e Historia |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Museo Nacional de la Estampa exhibits the largest collection of graphic arts in Mexico |accessdate=March 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the museum’s space is dedicated to temporary exhibits such as the 2003 exhibit of works from the Centro de Formación y Producción Gráfica del Antiguo Colegio Jesuita located in [[Pátzcuaro]], [[Michoacán]]. This show had works from fifty artists including [[Francisco Castro Leñero]], [[Mario Rangel Faz]], [[Roberto Turnbull]] and [[Mónica Sotos]].&lt;ref name="arteshis"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.artesvisuales.com.mx/museos/temporales/museo.php?TMP_CONSECUTIVO=2372 |title= Museo Nacional de la Estampa |publisher=Artes Visuales |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=March 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These temporary exhibits are part of the museum’s mission to preserve and promote the printed arts in Mexico. Temporary exhibits include works by both national and international artists from diverse periods from the 16th to the 21st century.&lt;ref name="bellasartes"/&gt; The museum hosted ten temporary exhibitions in 2009 and registered 34,578 visitors. These expositions include the collection of [[Alejandro Alvarado]] and an exposition called “Tauromaquia, Mano a Mano” ([[Bullfighting]], hand to hand). The latter exhibition featured works from [[Francisco de Goya y Lucientes]], [[Salvador Dalí]], one work by [[Pablo Picasso]] and filmmaker [[Jean Cocteau]].&lt;ref name="conaculta"/&gt;

The museum also supports activities related to research, but most of the space is designed to accommodate the highest number of visitors possible.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14507">'''National cinema''' is a term sometimes used in [[film theory]] and [[film criticism]] to describe the films associated with a specific nation-state. Although there is little relatively written on theories of national cinema it has an irrefutably important role in [[globalization]]. Film provides a unique window to other cultures, particularly where the output of a nation or region is high. Countries like South Korea, Russia and Iran have over the years produced a large body of critically acclaimed films. Regardless of the stories or styles of filmmaking the medium inherently contains a dense wealth of information about people and places through which audiences gain knowledge.[[File:First look launch of Baahubali 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|The [[Cinema of India|Indian Cinema]] produces movies in over 18 languages and sells more tickets than any other country in the world.]]Like other film theory or film criticism terms (e.g., "[[art film]]"), the term "national cinema" is hard to define, and its meaning is debated by film scholars and critics. A film may be considered to be part of a "national cinema" based on a number of factors. Simply put, a "nation's cinema" can be attributed to the country that provided the financing for the film, the language spoken in the film, the nationalities or dress of the characters, and the setting, music, or cultural elements present in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Jimmy Choi. Is National Cinema Mr. MacGuffin? International Films. The Institute of Communications Studies, University of Leeds, UK. Available at: http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/papers/vp01.cfm?outfit=ifilm&amp;folder=17&amp;paper=22&lt;/ref&gt; To define a national cinema, some scholars emphasize the structure of the film industry and the roles played by "...market forces, government support, and cultural transfers..."&lt;ref&gt;Tom O' Regan ''Australian National Cinema'', cited in Jimmy Choi.

Available at: http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/papers/vp01.cfm?outfit=ifilm&amp;folder=17&amp;paper=22
&lt;/ref&gt;
More theoretically, national cinema can refer to a large group of films, or "a body of [[textuality]]... given historical weight through common intertextual 'symptoms', or coherencies".&lt;ref name="Vitali, V. 2006"&gt;Vitali, V., &amp; Willemen, P. (2006). Theorising national cinema. London: Bfi (British Film Institute) Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Theorising National Cinema'', Philip Rosen suggests national cinema is a conceptualization of: (1) Selected 'national' films/texts themselves, the relationship between them, which be connected by a shared (general) symptom. (2) an understanding of the 'nation' as an entity in synchronicity with its 'symptom'. And (3) an understanding of past or traditional 'symptoms', also known as history or historiography, which contribute to current systems and 'symptoms'.&lt;ref name="Vitali, V. 2006"/&gt; These symptoms of intertextuality could refer to style, medium, content, narrative, narrative structure, costume, [[Mise-en-scène]], character, background, cinematography. It could refer to cultural background of those who make the movie and cultural background of those in the movie, of spectatorship, of spectacle.

==Canada==
Canadian cultural and film critics have long debated how Canadian national cinema can be defined, or whether there is a Canadian national cinema. Most of the films shown on Canadian movie screens are US imports. If "Canadian national cinema" is defined as the films made in Canada, then the canon of Canadian cinema would have to include lightweight teen-oriented fare such as ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]''(1979), ''[[Porky's]]'' (1983) or ''[[Death Ship (1980 film)|Death Ship]]'' (1980). Other critics have defined Canadian national cinema as a "...reflection of Canadian life and culture." Some critics argue that there are "two traditions of filmmaking in Canada." The "documentary realist tradition" espoused by the federal government's [[National Film Board]] and avant-garde films.

Scott MacKenzie argues that by the late 1990s, if Canada did have a popular cinema with both avant-garde and experimental elements, that was influenced by European filmmakers such as [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Wim Wenders]]. MacKenzie argues that Canadian cinema has a "...self-conscious concern with the incorporation of cinematic and televisual images", and as examples, he cites films such as [[David Cronenberg]]'s ''[[Videodrome]]'' (1983), [[Atom Egoyan]]'s'' [[Family Viewing]]'' (1987), [[Robert Lepage]]'s ''[[The Confessional]] (Le Confessionnal)'' (1995) and [[Srinivas Krishna]]'s ''Masala'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;Scott MacKenzie, University of Glasgow. National Identity, Canadian Cinema, and Multiculturalism. Available at: https://archive.is/20121201023833/http://www.uqtr.ca/AE/vol_4/scott.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
France's national cinema includes both popular cinema and "avant-garde" films. French national cinema is associated with the [[auteur theory|auteur]] filmmakers and with a variety of specific movements. Avant-garde filmmakers include [[Germaine Dulac]], Marie and [[Jean Epstein]]. [[Poetic Realism]] filmmakers include [[Jean Renoir]] and [[Marcel Carné]]. The [[French New Wave]] filmmakers include [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[François Truffaut]]. The 1990s and 2000s "[[postmodernism|postmodern]] cinema" of France includes filmmakers such as [[Jean-Jacques Beinex]], [[Luc Besson]] and [[Coline Serreau]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Hayward. French National Cinema&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
During the German [[Weimar Republic]], German national cinema was influenced by silent and sound "Bergfilm" (this translates to "mountain film"). During the 1920s and early 1930s, German national cinema was known for the progressive and artistic approaches to filmmaking with "shifted conventional cinematic vocabulary" and which gave actresses a much larger range of character-types.&lt;ref name="brightlightsfilm.com"&gt;''German National Cinema'', by Sabine Hake. London and New York: Routledge, 2002. Trade paper, {{ISBN|0-415-08902-6}}. Reviewed by Robert von Dassanowsky. Available at: http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/38/booksgerman.htm&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Nazi]] era, the major film studio UFA was controlled by Propaganda Minister [[Goebbels]]. UFA produced "Hetzfilme" (anti-Semitic hate films) and films which emphasized the "theme of heroic death." Other film genres produced by UFA during the Nazi era included historical and biographical dramas that emphasized the achievements in German history, comedy films, and propaganda films.&lt;ref name="brightlightsfilm.com"/&gt;

During the [[Cold War]] from the 1950s through the 1980s, there were West German films and East German films. Film historians and film scholars do not agree whether the films from the different parts of Cold War-era Germany can be considered to be a single "German national cinema." Some West German films were about the "immediate past in sociopolitical thought and in literature". [[East Germany|East German]] films were often [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-funded "socially critical" films. Some East German films examined Germany's [[Nazi]] past, such as Wolfgang Staudte's ''Die Mörder sind unter uns'' (''The Murderers Are Among Us'').&lt;ref name="brightlightsfilm.com"/&gt;

The New German Cinema of the 1970s and 1980s included films by directors such as [[Fassbinder]], [[Werner Herzog|Herzog]], and [[Wim Wenders]]. While these directors made films with "many ideological and cinematic messages", they all shared the common element of providing an "aesthetic alternativ(e) to [[Classic Hollywood cinema|Hollywood]]" films and "a break with the cultural and political traditions associated with the [[Third Reich]]"(159).&lt;ref name="brightlightsfilm.com"/&gt;

==Poland==
After World War II, the Lódz Film School was founded in 1948. During the 1950s and 1960s, a "Polish School" of filmmakers developed, such as [[Wojciech Has]], [[Kazimierz Kutz]], [[Andrzej Munk]] and [[Andrzej Wajda]]. According to film scholar Marek Haltof, the Polish School of directors made films which can be described as the "Cinema of Distrust." In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wajda, Krzysztof Zanussi and Barbara Sass made influential films which garnered interest outside of Poland. However, even though Western countries became increasingly interested in Polish cinema during this period, the country's film infrastructure and market was disintegrating.&lt;ref&gt;Shelia Skaff. The cinema that is Marek Haltof's ''Polish National Cinema''. Review of Marek Haltof's book Polish National Cinema. Available at: http://www.kinoeye.org/02/14/skaff14.php
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico==
Although it is difficult to determine and define a 'national cinema', much of what many consider Mexican national cinema, but not limited to, is [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema|Golden Age of Mexican Cinema]] and films that revolve around the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Unique trajectories of Mexican cinema's development shaped historically specific understandings of the ontology of the moving image, leading to unique configurations of documentation and fictionalization. The Revolution spilled across pages of the press, and became the primary subject of Mexican films produced between 1911 and 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Navitsky, Rielle Public Spectacles of Violence: Sensational Cinema and Journalism in Early Twentieth-Century Mexico and Brazil Durham, NC: Duke University Press 344 pp., $27.95, {{ISBN|082236963X}} Publication Date: June 2017. History: Reviews of New Books. 46. 71-72. 10.1080/03612759.2018.1436314.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a high interest in topicality in and capturing current events as they unfolded, re-staging, or combining both approaching, created a sensationalist appeal in these visual 'records' of death and injury. Compilation documentaries, such as Toscano's [[Memories of a Mexican|Memorias de un Mexicano]] in the years following the Mexican Revolution can be seen as part of a broader cultural politics of nationalism that worked to naturalize and to consolidate the political and ideological story of the revolution.

Later narrativized dramas, such as [[María Candelaria]], [[The Pearl (film)]], [[Enamorada (film)]], [[Río Escondido (1948 film)|Rio Escondido]], Saián Mexico, or [[Pueblerina]] by [[Emilio Fernandez]] and/or [[Gabriel Figueroa]], are often considered part of the Mexican national cinematic body. These films, and most popular films of the 1920s in Mexico, adopted [[David Bordwell]]'s "cinematic norms": narrative linkage, cause and effect, goal oriented protagonists, temporal order or cinematic time, and filmic space as story space. But also, is noted to have incorporated visual folkloric style of [[José Guadalupe Posada]], the deconstructing landscapes of [[Gerardo Murillo]], and the low angles, deep focus, diagonal lines, and 'native' imagery in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s [[Que Viva Mexico]] ! Although a mélange of Western and Mexican influences coexist in Fernandez's films, his Mexican biography and locality leave a legacy of romanticizing Mexico and Mexican history, often presenting idyllic ranches, singing, and a charming life of the poor.

Although of European heritage, [[Louis Buñuel]]'s work in Mexico is another example that presents 'symptoms' of Mexican national identity.  Although less well received by lower classes, and more admired by upper classes, Buñuel's [[Los Olvidados]] stands as an example that a director's national heritage doesn't always have to contribute to the conceptualization of a nation's cinema. Rather than building the nation through celebration, the film presents problem, which contribute to a global identity and context of the nation state. Buñuel, however, is less interested in presenting some 'identity' of message, national or international, and remarked that "to ask whether the film is Mexican or not, is to resist, to seek, to disperse, the very mystery this film articulates for us".

Modern genres embraced and nurtured as 'Mexican national cinema' are often those of the social and family melodrama genre, such as [[Como agua para chocolate]] (1991) by Alfonso Arau, the working class melodrama (i.e. Danzon in 1991 by Maria Novaro), the comedy (i.e. Sólo con tu pareja, 1991, Alfonso Cuarón) and the rural ''costumbrismo'' film (i.e. La mujer de Benjamin, 1990, by Carlos Carrera). Changes in the politics of film industry instituions allowed these film texts and their directors to "transform the traditional filmic paradigm". Up to 60% of financial assistance for national, Latin American, and European productions were provided by the [[:es:Instituto Mexicano de Cinematograf%C3%ADa|Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografia]], new models of co-production were created, and distribution and sales channels were opened abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Torres San Martin, Patricia. “The Guadalajarans’ Amores Perros.” Comunicación y Sociedad, núm. 37 , June 2000, pp. 179–202., doi:10.15417/1881.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Netherlands Architecture Institute''' (NAI) is a cultural institute for architecture and urban development, comprising a museum, an archive plus library, and a platform for lectures and debates. The NAI was established in 1988 and has been based in [[Rotterdam]] since 1993.

The NAI is a private organisation with a government brief, which is to manage the collection of archives that document the history of Dutch architecture. Moreover, as a sector institute for architecture it is also tasked with supporting the professional field. The building also houses a bookshop and a cafe.

==History==
The idea of establishing a national architecture museum came about in 1912 when the Amsterdam architects’ association Architectura et Amicitia was obliged to rent an extra room in Hotel Parkzicht in Amsterdam to store its archive of drawings and models. Architect [[J.H.W. Leliman]] was a key advocate of an architecture museum. A committee comprising J. Ingenohl, J.H. de Groot and W.A.E. van der Pluym as members was set up to look into the possibilities of such a museum. In 1915, A et A members suggested storing the collection at the Rijksacademie in Amsterdam, and housing it in an independent museum at a later date. These ideas did not come to fruition, however.

In the 1980s, three cultural institutes collaborated to form the NAI. These were the Netherlands Architecture Documentation Centre (NDB), the Architecture Museum Foundation (SAM) and Stichting Wonen foundation. Following this, a controversy ensued between Amsterdam and Rotterdam as to where an architecture museum/institute would have to be based. Minister Brinkman opted for Rotterdam. Previous plans to set up the NAI in the vacant library at Botersloot were abandoned. The NAI found temporary accommodation in a building at Westersingel before the construction of a new building started.

==The building==
In 1988, a competition was held among six architects to find an architect for a new building. These were: [[Jo Coenen]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Benthem Crouwel Architekten]], [[Wim Quist]], [[Luigi Snozzi]] and [[Ralph Erskine (architect)|Ralph Erskine]]. Koolhaas’s design was the favourite among the specialist press and was also favoured by Riek Bakker, the director of Rotterdam’s Department of Urban Development. However, the NAI awarded Jo Coenen the commission, the decisive factors being the blending of the design into the surroundings and the references to the history of architecture.

After an intensive period of renovation, the NAI opened its doors on 1 July 2011. The most salient part of the renovation was moving the entrance to the pond level. The restaurant was extended. An exhibition room and additional space for educational activities were also added. At the site of the original entrance is now the DoeDek, a hands-on area where visitors can experiment with Lego, large blocks and cut-outs. As the original building’s architect, Jo Coenen was also responsible for its renovation.

==Sonneveld House Museum==
Sonneveld House Museum is a house built in the [[Nieuwe Bouwen]] style, the Dutch branch of the International School of Modernism. It was furnished with furniture and materials made by W.H. Gispen, B. van der Leck and others. The house was designed in 1933 by architects’ firm Brinkman and Van der Vlugt for the Sonneveld family. Albertus Sonneveld was one of the directors of the Van Nelle factory.

The Rotterdam Stichting Bevordering van Volkskracht (a foundation for the enhancement of popular health, welfare and culture in the city) bought the museum house in 1977. A form of collaboration has existed between Volkskracht and the NAI since February 1999. The house was restored and opened to the public in 2001. The restoration work was done by architects’ firm Molenaar &amp; Van Winden, with the NAI taking on the refurnishing work.

==The collection==
Private individuals started collecting architectural archives as early as the end of the nineteenth century. One of these was the Architecture Museum Foundation (SAM). In the 1970s, the government became interested in these archives, setting up the Netherlands Architecture Documentation Centre (NDB) as part of the Rijksdienst voor de Monumentenzorg, the Netherlands Department for Conservation. When the archives were transferred to the NDB, they officially became state property. The NAI’s archive collection is still a national collection.

The libraries of the Academie van Bouwkunst Amsterdam (Amsterdam Academy of Architecture), the Bond van Nederlandse Architecten BNA (the Royal Institute of Dutch Architects) and Stichting Wonen, a consumer organisation for information on sustainable living, were added to the NDB’s collection. The collection now houses some 18 kilometres of archive material. It also contains over 500 archives and collections of Dutch architects, organisations and educational institutes in the field of architecture and urban development, and comprises drawings, sketches, models, documentation, correspondence and photos. The internationally focused library contains about 60,000 volumes.

The NAI houses the Stichting BONAS foundation, (Stichting Bibliografieën en Oeuvrelijsten Nederlandse Architecten en Stedebouwkundigen, which translates as Bibliographies and Lists of Works of Dutch Architects and Urban Designers). Working on the basis of archive and literature study, this organisation reconstructs the work of Dutch designers from 1790 to the present and publishes it in book form.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Exhibitions==
The NAI organises exhibitions about the designed environment: about architecture, urban development, design and spatial planning. These are some of the exhibitions that were held in recent years: Polders (2005), China Contemporary (2006), Wijdeveld: plan the impossible (2006), From Cuypers to Coenen (2007), Le Corbusier (2007), Shape our country (2009), Disputed City (2010) and Architecture of Consequence (2011). In addition to temporary exhibitions there are two (semi)permanent exhibitions: Stad van Nederland (Dutchville) and De Schatkamer (Treasury). Dutchville is about how the city is perceived and about its beautiful and slightly less appealing aspects. Opened in September 2011, the Treasury displays masterpieces from the collection in an exhibition space designed by Rem Koolhaas, which was opened in September 2011.

==Platform==
To promote its innovation agenda ‘Architecture of Consequence’, the NAI organises platform activities such as lectures and debates both in the Netherlands and abroad. What role can architecture play in solving social problems? This concerns topics such as food production, the social climate, renewable energy, alternative use of space, social cohesion and value creation. A ‘matchmaking’ programme brings together expertise on these subjects so as to find approaches to spatial tasks such as environmental issues or housing shortages. Studying and discussing these tasks puts them onto local and international agendas. The matchmaking programme focuses primarily on India and China.

==Education==
The NAI offers programmes for primary and secondary education. It also works with various universities and universities of applied sciences on enhancing various subjects, study assignments, excursions and guided tours. Everyone can work hands-on on the DoeDek using large building blocks, Lego and cut-outs. Classes for children, supervised by architects and scientists, are to be held from February 2012.

== UAR (Urban Augmented Reality) ==
The NAI introduced UAR on 30 June 2010. UAR is an acronym for Urban Augmented Reality. It is a free-of-charge 3D architecture application that uses Augmented reality. This means that a layer of information has been added to reality. In UAR, the existing, built environment is supplemented by a historical, a future or an alternative layer using 3D models. UAR shows us what is not there, what the city used to look like, by showing us buildings that have since disappeared. The city as it could have been, using models and drawings to display alternative designs that never made it. And the city as it will become, using artist’s impressions of future projects. The collections of various institutes and heritage organisations including the NAI’s own collection are used for this. UAR users can also add information to the application themselves. At present, UAR covers the cities of Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Utrecht, The Hague, Breda, Haarlem and Gouda.

==NAiM | Bureau Europa==
On 2 September 2006, the NAI opened an annexe in Maastricht, in the Wiebengahal, which adjoins the Bonnefanten Museum, in the Céramique district. As of April 2009, this NAiM/Bureau Europa acquired independent status. Since 2013 the new name is Bureau Europa.

==NAI Publishers==
NAI Publishers originated from the NAI’s publication department but has been an independent company for 15 years now. The company specialises in publishing books on architecture, urban development, spatial planning, visual arts, photography and design. NAI Publishers’ bookshop was located in the NAI building. July 2012 NAI Publishers merged with 010 Publishers, a similar publisher, on a new location in Rotterdam. The name of the merger is nai010 publishers.

==Merger==
State Secretary [[Halbe Zijlstra]] designated the NAI as one of the organisations that were going to form the new institute for the Creative Industry on 1 January 2013. That date the NAI merged with Stichting Premsela, the Netherlands Institute for Design and Fashion (Design sector institute) and Virtueel Platform (E-culture knowledge institute). The name of the merger is ''[[Het Nieuwe Instituut]]'', The New Institute.

==Board of Management and Supervisory Board==
The last management of the NAI comprised Ole Bouman (general director) and Peter Haasbroek (business director). The members of the Supervisory Board were: Hans Andersson (chairman), Karin Laglas (treasurer), [[Jeanne van Heeswijk]], Leon Ramakers, Dirk Sijmons, Nathalie de Vries and Joop van der Leeuw.

An '''old master print''' is a [[work of art]] produced by a [[printing]] process within the Western tradition. The term remains current in the [[art trade]], and there is no easy alternative in English to distinguish the works of "[[fine art]]" produced in [[printmaking]] from the vast range of decorative, utilitarian and [[popular prints]] that grew rapidly alongside the artistic print from the 15th century onwards. Fifteenth-century prints are sufficiently rare that they are classed as old master prints even if they are of crude or merely workmanlike artistic quality. A date of about 1830 is usually taken as marking the end of the period whose prints are covered by this term.

The main techniques used, in order of their introduction, are [[woodcut]], [[engraving]], [[etching]], [[mezzotint]] and [[aquatint]], although there are others. Different techniques are often combined in a single print.  With rare exceptions printed on textiles, such as silk, or on [[vellum]], old master prints are printed on [[paper]]. This article is concerned with the artistic, historical and social aspects of the subject; the article on [[printmaking]] summarizes the techniques used in making old master prints, from a modern perspective.

Many great European artists, such as [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Rembrandt]], and [[Francisco Goya]], were dedicated printmakers. In their own day, their international reputations largely came from their prints, which were spread far more widely than their paintings. Influences between artists were also mainly transmitted beyond a single city by prints (and sometimes drawings), for the same reason. Prints therefore are frequently brought up in detailed analyses of individual paintings in [[art history]].  Today, thanks to colour photo reproductions, and public galleries, their paintings are much better known, whilst their prints are only rarely exhibited, for conservation reasons.  But some museum [[print room]]s allow visitors to see their collection, sometimes only by appointment.

==History==

===Woodcut before Albrecht Dürer===
The oldest technique is woodcut, or woodblock printing, which was invented as a method for printing on cloth in China, and perhaps separately in Egypt in the [[Byzantine]] period. This had reached Europe via the [[Byzantine]] or [[Islamic]] worlds before 1300, as a method of printing patterns on textiles. [[Paper]] arrived in Europe, also from China via [[Islamic Spain]], slightly later, and was being manufactured in Italy by the end of the thirteenth century, and in Burgundy and Germany by the end of the fourteenth.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths (1980), 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious images and [[playing cards]] are documented as being produced on paper, probably printed, by a German in [[Bologna]] in 1395.&lt;ref&gt;Field, Richard (1965). ''Fifteenth Century Woodcuts and Metalcuts''. Washington, D.C.: National Gallery of Art.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most impressive printed European images to survive from before 1400 are printed on cloth, for use as hangings on walls or furniture, including altars and [[lectern]]s. Some were used as a pattern to embroider over. Some religious images were used as bandages, to speed healing.&lt;ref&gt;Hind (1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest print images are mostly of a high artistic standard, and were clearly designed by artists with a background in painting (on walls, panels or manuscripts). Whether these artists cut the blocks themselves, or only inked the design on the block for another to carve, is not known. During the fifteenth century the number of prints produced greatly increased as paper became freely available and cheaper, and the average artistic level fell, so that by the second half of the century the typical woodcut is a relatively crude image. The great majority of surviving 15th-century prints are religious, although these were probably the ones more likely to survive. Their makers were sometimes called "Jesus maker" or "saint-maker" in documents. As with manuscript books, monastic institutions sometimes produced, and often sold, prints. No artists can be identified with specific woodcuts until towards the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 1–6, quotes 2, 33–42. Mayor, 5–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The little evidence we have suggests that woodcut prints became relatively common and cheap during the fifteenth century, and were affordable by skilled workers in towns. For example, what may be the earliest surviving Italian print, the "Madonna of the Fire", was hanging by a nail to a wall in a small school in [[Forlì]] in 1428. The school caught fire, and the crowd who gathered to watch saw the print carried up into the air by the fire, before falling down into the crowd. This was regarded as a miraculous escape and the print was carried to [[Forlì Cathedral]], where it remains, since 1636 in a special chapel, displayed once a year. Like the majority of prints before approximately 1460, only a single impression (the term used for a copy of an old master print; "copy" is used for a print copying another print) of this print has survived.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:5086 bassenge german 1480.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Anonymous German 15th century woodcut, about 1480, with hand-colouring, including (unusually) spots of gold. 5.2 x 3.9 cm (similar to the original size on most screens)]]
[[File:Saint Christopher. Woodcut. Wellcome V0031876.jpg|thumb|230px|A woodcut of St Christopher dated 1420]]
Woodcut blocks are printed with light pressure, and are capable of printing several thousand impressions, and even at this period some prints may well have been produced in that quantity. Many prints were hand-coloured, mostly in [[watercolour]]; in fact the hand-colouring of prints continued for many centuries, though dealers have removed it from many surviving examples. Italy, Germany, France and the Netherlands were the main areas of production; England does not seem to have produced any prints until about 1480. However prints are highly portable, and were transported across Europe. A Venetian document of 1441 already complains about cheap imports of [[playing cards]] damaging the local industry.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 14–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Block book|Block-books]] were a very popular form of (short) book, where a page with both pictures and text was cut as a single woodcut. They were much cheaper than manuscript books, and were mostly produced in the Netherlands; the ''Art of Dying'' ([[Ars moriendi]]) was the most famous; thirteen different sets of blocks are known.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt; As a relief technique (see [[printmaking]]) woodcut can be printed easily together with movable type, and after this invention arrived in Europe about 1450 printers quickly came to include woodcuts in their books. Some book owners also pasted prints into prayer books in particular.&lt;ref&gt;A number have survived pasted on the inside of the lids of boxes or chests, like  [http://gallica.bnf.fr/anthologie/notices/00340.htm this example].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Playing card]]s were another notable use of prints, and French versions are the basis of the traditional sets still in use today.

By the last quarter of the century there was a large demand for woodcuts for book-illustrations, and in both Germany and Italy standards at the top end of the market improved considerably. [[Nuremberg]] was the largest centre of German publishing, and [[Michael Wolgemut]], the master of the largest workshop there worked on many projects, including the gigantic [[Nuremberg Chronicle]].&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 34–42. Mayor, 32–60. Bartrum (1995), 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albrecht Dürer]] was apprenticed to Wolgemut during the early stages of the project, and was the godson of Anton Koberger, its printer and publisher. Dürer's career was to take the art of the woodcut to its highest development.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum, 17–63. Landau and Parshall, 167–174.&lt;/ref&gt;

===German engraving before Dürer===
[[File:Martyrium des hl. Sebastian (Meister der Spielkarten).jpg|thumb|"Martyrdom of [[St Sebastian]]", engraving by the [[Master of the Playing Cards]], c. 1445]]

Engraving on metal was part of the [[goldsmith]]'s craft throughout the Medieval period, and the idea of printing engraved designs onto paper probably began as a method for them to record the designs on pieces they had sold. Some artists trained as painters became involved from about 1450–1460, although many engravers continued to come from a goldsmithing background. From the start, engraving was in the hands of the luxury tradesmen, unlike woodcut, where at least the cutting of the block was associated with the lower-status trades of carpentry, and perhaps sculptural wood-carving. Engravings were also important from very early on as models for other artists, especially painters and sculptors, and many works survive, especially from smaller cities, which take their compositions directly from prints. Serving as a pattern for artists may have been a primary purpose for the creation of many prints, especially the numerous series of [[Twelve apostles|apostle]] figures.

The surviving engravings, though the majority are religious, show a greater proportion of secular images than other types of art from the period, including [[woodcut]]. This is certainly partly the result of the relative survival rates—although wealthy fifteenth-century houses certainly contained secular images on walls (inside and outside), and cloth hangings, these types of image have survived in tiny numbers. The Church was much better at retaining its images. Engravings were relatively expensive and sold to an urban middle-class that had become increasingly affluent in the belt of cities that stretched from the Netherlands down the Rhine to Southern Germany, Switzerland and Northern Italy. Engraving was also used for the same types of images as [[woodcut]]s, notably devotional images and [[playing cards]], but many seem to have been collected for keeping out of sight in an album or book, to judge by the excellent state of preservation of many pieces of paper over five hundred years old.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 46–51, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maître E. S. Les Amoureux sur un banc de gazon L.211.jpg|thumb|[[Master E. S.]], "''Liebespaar auf der Rasenbank''"]]
Again unlike woodcut, identifiable artists are found from the start. The German, or possibly German-Swiss, [[Master of the Playing Cards]] was active by at least the 1440s; he was clearly a trained painter.&lt;ref&gt;Shestack (1967a), numbers 1–2. Mayor, 115–117.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Master E. S.]] was a prolific engraver, from a [[goldsmith]]ing background, active from about 1450–1467, and the first to sign his prints with a monogram in the plate. He made significant technical developments, which allowed more impressions to be taken from each plate. Many of his faces have a rather pudding-like appearance, which reduces the impact of what are otherwise fine works. Much of his work still has great charm, and the secular and comic subjects he engraved are almost never found in the surviving painting of the period. Like the Otto prints in Italy, much of his work was probably intended to appeal to women.&lt;ref&gt;Shestack (1967b). Shestack (1967a), numbers 4–19. Spangeberg, 1–3. Mayor, 118–123. Landau and Parshall, 46–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major artist to engrave was [[Martin Schongauer]] (c. 1450–1491), who worked in southern Germany and was also a well-known painter. His father and brother were goldsmiths, so he may well have had experience with the burin from an early age. His 116 engravings have a clear authority and beauty and became well known in Italy as well as northern Europe, as well as much copied by other engravers. He also further developed engraving technique, in particular refining [[cross-hatching]] to depict volume and shade in a purely linear medium.&lt;ref&gt;Shestack (1967a), numbers 34–115. Landau and Parshall, 50–56. Mayor, 130–135. Spangeberg, 5–7. Bartrum, 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other notable artist of this period is known as the [[Housebook Master]]. He was a highly talented German artist who is also known from drawings, especially the Housebook album from which he takes his name. His prints were made exclusively in [[drypoint]], scratching his lines on the plate to leave a much shallower line than an engraver's [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] would produce; he may have invented this technique. Consequently, only a few impressions could be produced from each plate—perhaps about twenty—although some plates were reworked to prolong their life. Despite this limitation, his prints were clearly widely circulated, as many copies of them exist by other printmakers. This is highly typical of admired prints in all media until at least 1520; there was no enforceable concept of anything like copyright. Many of the Housebook Master's print compositions are only known from copies, as none of the presumed originals have survived — a very high proportion of his original prints are only known from a single impression. The largest collection of his prints is at Amsterdam; these were probably kept as a collection, perhaps by the artist himself, from around the time of their creation.&lt;ref&gt;Filedt Kok. Mayor, 124–129.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meckenem.jpg|thumb|The first self-portrait, by the first businessman in the history of printmaking, [[Israhel van Meckenam]], with his wife]]
[[Israhel van Meckenam]] was an engraver from the borders of Germany and the Netherlands, who probably trained with Master ES, and ran the most productive workshop for engravings of the century between about 1465 and 1503. He produced over 600 plates, most copies of other prints, and was more sophisticated in self-presentation, signing later prints with his name and town, and producing the first print self-portrait of himself and his wife. Some plates seem to have been reworked more than once by his workshop, or produced in more than one version, and many impressions have survived, so his ability to distribute and sell his prints was evidently sophisticated. His own compositions are often very lively, and take a great interest in the secular life of his day.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 56–63. Mayor, 138–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The earliest Italian engravings===
Printmaking in [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]] both appeared in Northern Italy within a few decades of their invention north of the Alps, and had similar uses and characters, though within significantly different artistic styles, and with from the start a much greater proportion of secular subjects. The earliest known Italian woodcut has been mentioned above. Engraving probably came first to [[Florence]] in the 1440s; [[Vasari]] typically claimed that his fellow-Florentine, the goldsmith and [[niello]]ist [[Maso Finiguerra]] (1426–64) invented the technique. It is now clear this is wrong, and there are now considered to be no prints as such that can be attributed to him on anything other than a speculative basis. He may never have made any printed engravings from plates, as opposed to taking impressions from work intended to be nielloed. There are a number of complex [[niello]] religious scenes that he probably executed, and may or may not have designed, which were influential for the Florentine style in engraving. Some paper impressions and sulphur casts survive from these. These are a number of paxes in the [[Bargello]], Florence, plus one in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York which depict scenes with large and well-organised crowds of small figures. There are also drawings in the [[Uffizi, Florence]] that may be by him.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson. Landau and Parshall, 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Florence====
[[File:Battle of the Naked Men MetNY.jpg|thumb|[[Antonio Pollaiuolo]], "[[Battle of the Nudes (engraving)|Battle of the Nude Men]]"]]
Where German engraving arrived into a still [[Gothic art]]istic world, Italian engraving caught the very early Renaissance, and from the start the prints are mostly larger, more open in atmosphere, and feature classical and exotic subjects. They are less densely worked, and usually do not use cross-hatching. From about 1460–1490 two styles developed in Florence, which remained the largest centre of Italian engraving. These are called (although the terms are less often used now) the "Fine Manner" and the "Broad Manner", referring to the typical thickness of the lines used. The leading artists in the Fine Manner are [[Baccio Baldini]] and the "Master of the Vienna Passion", and in the Broad Manner, [[Francesco Rosselli]] and [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]], whose only print was the ''[[Battle of the Nudes (engraving)|Battle of the Nude Men]]'' (right), the masterpiece of 15th-century Florentine engraving.&lt;ref&gt;Langdale. Landau and Parshall, 65, 72–76.&lt;/ref&gt; This uses a new zigzag "return stroke" for modelling, which he probably invented.&lt;ref&gt;Langdale.&lt;/ref&gt;

A chance survival is a collection of mostly rather crudely executed Florentine prints now in the [[British Museum]], known as the Otto Prints after an earlier owner of most of them. This was probably the workshop's own reference set of prints, mostly round or oval, that were used to decorate the inside covers of boxes, primarily for female use. It has been suggested that boxes so decorated may have been given as gifts at weddings. The subject matter and execution of this group suggests they were intended to appeal to middle-class female taste; lovers and cupids abound, and an [[allegory]] shows a near-naked young man tied to a stake and being beaten by several women.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 89. Levinson.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ferrara ====
The other notable early centre was [[Ferrara]], from the 1460s, which probably produced both sets of the so-called "[[Mantegna Tarocchi]]" cards, which are not playing cards, but a sort of educational tool for young humanists with fifty cards, featuring the Planets and Spheres, [[Apollo]] and the [[Muses]], personifications of the Seven [[liberal arts]] and the four Virtues, as well as "the Conditions of Man" from Pope to peasant.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 71–72. Spangeberg, 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mantegna in Mantua====
[[File:Herkules und Antäus (Mantegna).jpg|thumb|left|"[[Hercules]] and [[Antaeus]]", [[engraving]], 1490–1500, School of Mantegna&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, no. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Andrea Mantegna]] who trained in [[Padua]], and then settled in [[Mantua]], was the most influential figure in Italian engraving of the century, although it is still debated whether he actually engraved any plates himself (a debate revived in recent years by [[Suzanne Boorsch]]). A number of engravings have long been ascribed to his school or workshop, with only seven usually given to him personally. The whole group form a coherent stylistic group and very clearly reflect his style in painting and drawing, or copy surviving works of his. They seem to date from the late 1460s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 65–71. Mayor, 187–197. Spangeberg, 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The impact of Dürer===
{{Main|Albrecht Dürer}}

In the last five years of the fifteenth century, Dürer, then in his late twenties and with his own workshop in Nuremberg, began to produce woodcuts and engravings of the highest quality which spread very quickly through the artistic centres of Europe. By about 1505 most young Italian printmakers went through a phase of directly copying either whole prints or large parts of Dürer's landscape backgrounds, before going on to adapt his technical advances to their own style. Copying of prints was already a large and accepted part of the printmaking culture but no prints were copied as frequently as Dürer's.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (2002). Bartrum (1995), 22–63. Landau and Parshall, see index. Mayor, 258–281.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dürer was also a painter, but few of his paintings could be seen except by those with good access to private houses in the Nuremberg area. The lesson of how he, following more spectacularly in the footsteps of Schongauer and Mantegna, was able so quickly to develop a continent-wide reputation very largely through his prints was not lost on other painters, who began to take much greater interest in printmaking.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. Landau and Parshall, 347–358. Bartrum (1995), 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy 1500–1515===
For a brief period a number of artists who began by copying Dürer made very fine prints in a range of individual styles. They included [[Giulio Campagnola]], who succeeded in translating the new style [[Giorgione]] and [[Titian]] had brought to [[Venice|Venetian]] painting into engraving. [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] and [[Agostino Veneziano]] both spent some years in Venice before moving to [[Rome]], but even their early prints show classicizing tendencies as well as Northern influence.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. Landau and Parshall, see index.&lt;/ref&gt; The styles of the Florentine [[Cristofano Robetta]], and [[Benedetto Montagna]] from [[Vicenza]] are still based in Italian painting of the period, and are also later influenced by [[Giulio Campagnola]].&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, 289–334, 390–414. Landau and Parshall, 65–102 (see also index). Mayor, 143–156, 173, 223, 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giovanni Battista Palumba]], once known as "Master IB with the Bird" from his monogram, was the major Italian artist in [[woodcut]] in these years, as well as an engraver of charming mythological scenes, often with an erotic theme.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, 440–455. Landau and Parshall, 199, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rise of the reproductive print===
[[File:Moses (Matham).jpg|thumb|Reproductive engraving by [[Jacob Matham]], in this case of a [[sculpture]], "[[Moses]]", by [[Michelangelo]], 1593]]

Prints copying prints were already common, and many fifteenth century prints must have been copies of paintings, but not intended to be seen as such, but as images in their own right. [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s workshop produced a number of engravings copying his ''Triumph of Caesar'' (now [[Hampton Court Palace]]), or drawings for it, which were perhaps the first prints intended to be understood as depicting paintings—called ''reproductive prints''. With an increasing pace of innovation in art, and of a critical interest among a non-professional public, reliable depictions of paintings filled an obvious need. In time this demand was almost to smother the old master print.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. Landau &amp; Parshall, chapter IV, whose emphasis is disputed by Bury, 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dürer never copied any of his paintings directly into prints, although some of his portraits base a painting and a print on the same drawing, which is very similar. The next stage began when [[Titian]] in Venice, and [[Raphael]] in Rome, almost simultaneously began to collaborate with printmakers to make prints to their designs. Titian at this stage worked with Domenico Campagnola and others on woodcuts, whilst Raphael worked with Raimondi on engravings, for which many of Raphael's drawings survive.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. Landau and Parshall, 117–146.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather later, the paintings done by the [[School of Fontainebleau]] were copied in etchings, apparently in a brief organised programme including many of the painters themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, parts III and IV.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian partnerships were artistically and commercially successful, and inevitably attracted other printmakers who simply copied paintings independently to make wholly reproductive prints. Especially in Italy, these prints, of greatly varying quality, came to dominate the market and tended to push out original printmaking, which declined noticeably from about 1530–40 in Italy. By now some publisher/dealers had become important, especially Dutch and Flemish operators like [[Philippe Galle]] and [[Hieronymus Cock]], developing networks of distribution that were becoming international, and much work was commissioned by them.  The effect of the development of the print-selling trade is a matter of scholarly controversy, but there is no question that by the mid-century the rate of original printmaking in Italy had declined considerably from that of a generation earlier, if not as precipitously as in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall develop the traditional view of decline, which Bury contests in his Introduction, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–12, and seeks to demonstrate the opposite view throughout his work.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The North after Dürer===
[[File:5168 bassenge leyden.jpg|thumb|left|"The Milkmaid'", engraving by [[Lucas van Leyden]], 1510]]

Although no artist anywhere from 1500 to 1550 could ignore Dürer, several artists in his wake had no difficulty maintaining highly distinctive styles, often with little influence from him.   [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] was only a year younger than Dürer, but he was about thirty before he began to make woodcuts, in an intense Northern style reminiscent of [[Matthias Grünewald]].  He was also an early experimenter in the [[chiaroscuro]] woodcut technique.  His style later softened, and took in the influence of Dürer, but he concentrated his efforts on painting, in which he became dominant in Protestant Germany, based in [[Saxony]], handing over his very productive studio to his son at a relatively early age.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 166–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucas van Leyden]] had a prodigious natural talent for engraving, and his earlier prints were highly successful, with an often earthy treatment and brilliant technique, so that he came to be seen as Dürer's main rival in the North. However, his later prints suffered from straining after an Italian grandeur, which left only the technique applied to far less dynamic compositions. Like Dürer, he had a "flirtation" with etching, but on copper rather than iron. His Dutch successors for some time continued to be heavily under the spell of Italy, which they took most of the century to digest.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 316–319, 332–333, 333 quoted.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albrecht Altdorfer]] produced some Italianate religious prints, but he is most famous for his very Northern landscapes of drooping larches and firs, which are highly innovative in painting as well as prints.  He was among the most effective early users of the technique of [[etching]], recently invented as a printmaking technique by [[Daniel Hopfer]], an armourer from [[Augsburg]]. Neither Hopfer nor the other members of his family who continued his style were trained or natural artists, but many of their images have great charm, and their "ornament prints", made essentially as patterns for craftsmen in various fields, spread their influence widely.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 228, 304–308, 567. Bartrum (1995), 11–12, 144, 158, 183–197. Landau and Parshall, 323–328 (Hopfers); 202–209, 337–346 (Altdorfer).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Burgkmair]] from [[Augsburg]], [[Nuremberg]]'s neighbour and rival, was slightly older than Dürer, and had a parallel career in some respects, training with [[Martin Schongauer]] before apparently visiting Italy, where he formed his own synthesis of Northern and Italian styles, which he applied in painting and woodcut, mostly for books, but with many significant "single-leaf" (i.e. individual) prints. He is now generally credited with inventing the coloured [[Chiaroscuro woodcut|chiaroscuro (coloured) woodcut]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 130–146. Landau and Parshall, see index, 179–202 on the chiaroscuro woodcut.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Baldung]] was Dürer's pupil, and was left in charge of the Nuremberg workshop during Dürer's second Italian trip. He had no difficulty in maintaining a highly personal style in woodcut, and produced some very powerful images.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 67–80.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urs Graf]] was a Swiss mercenary and printmaker, who invented the [[white-line woodcut]] technique, in which his most distinctive prints were made.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 212–221.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Little Masters===
[[File:The Little Fool.jpg|thumb|left|"The Little Fool" by [[Sebald Beham]], 1542, 4.4 x 8.1 cm]]

The [[Little Masters]] is a term for a group of several printmakers, who all produced very small finely detailed engravings for a largely bourgeois market, combining in miniature elements from Dürer and from [[Marcantonio Raimondi]], and concentrating on secular, often mythological and erotic, rather than on religious themes.  The most talented were the brothers [[Bartel Beham]] and the longer-lived [[Sebald Beham]].  Like [[Georg Pencz]], they came from Nuremberg and were expelled by the council for [[atheism]] for a period.  The other principal member of the group was [[Heinrich Aldegrever]], a convinced [[Lutheran]] with [[Anabaptist]] leanings, who was perhaps therefore forced to spend much of his time producing ornament prints.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 99–129. Mayor, 315–317. Landau and Parshall, 315–316.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another convinced Protestant, [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], spent most of his adult career in England, then and for long after too primitive as both a market and in technical assistance to support fine printmaking. Whilst the famous blockcutter Hans Lützelburger was alive, he created from Holbein's designs the famous small woodcut series of the ''Dance of Death''. Another Holbein series, of ninety-one Old Testament scenes, in a much simpler style, was the most popular of attempts by several artists to create Protestant religious imagery. Both series were published in [[Lyon]] in France by a German publisher, having been created in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 221–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the deaths of this very brilliant generation, both the quality and quantity of German original printmaking suffered a strange collapse; perhaps it became impossible to sustain a convincing Northern style in the face of overwhelming Italian productions in a "commoditized" Renaissance style. The Netherlands now became more important for the production of prints, which would remain the case until the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mannerist printmaking==
[[File:5136 bassenge ghisi.jpg|thumb|left|"[[Hercules]]", engraving by [[Giorgio Ghisi]], after Bertani, 1558]]

Some Italian printmakers went in a very different direction to either Raimondi and his followers, or the Germans, and used the medium for experimentation and very personal work. [[Parmigianino]] produced some etchings himself, and also worked closely with [[Ugo da Carpi]] on chiaroscuro woodcuts and other prints.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 146–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giorgio Ghisi]] was the major printmaker of the Mantuan school, which preserved rather more individuality than Rome.  Much of his work was reproductive, but his original prints are often very fine.  He visited Antwerp, a reflection of the power the publishers there now had over what was now a European market for prints. A number of printmakers, mostly in etching, continued to produce excellent prints, but mostly as a sideline to either painting or reproductive printmaking.  They include [[Battista Franco]], [[Il Schiavone]], [[Federico Barocci]] and [[Ventura Salimbeni]], who only produced nine prints, presumably because it did not pay. [[Annibale Carracci]] and his cousin [[Ludovico Carracci|Ludovico]] produced a few influential etchings, while Annibale's brother Agostino engraved. Both brothers influenced [[Guido Reni]] and other Italian artists of the full [[Baroque]] period in the next century.&lt;ref&gt;Bury. Reed and Walsh, 105–114 on Annibale and subsequent artists in etching. Mayor, 410, 516.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
The Italian artists known as the [[School of Fontainebleau]] were hired in the 1530s by King [[Francis I of France]] to decorate his showpiece Chateau at Fontainebleau. In the course of the long project, etchings were produced, in unknown circumstances but apparently in Fontainebleau itself and mostly in the 1540s, mostly recording wall-paintings and plasterwork in the Chateau (much now destroyed). Technically they are mostly rather poor—dry and uneven—but the best powerfully evoke the strange and sophisticated atmosphere of the time.  Many of the best are by [[Leon Davent]] to designs by [[Primaticcio]], or [[Antonio Fantuzzi]]. Several of the artists, including Davent, later went to Paris and continued to produce prints there.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, parts III and IV. Mayor, 354–357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously the only consistent printmaker of stature in France had been [[Jean Duvet]], a goldsmith whose highly personal style seems halfway between Dürer and [[William Blake]].  His plates are extremely crowded, not conventionally well-drawn, but full of intensity; the opposite of the languorous elegance of the Fontainebleau prints, which were to have the greater effect on French printmaking. His prints date from 1520 to 1555, when he was seventy, and completed his masterpiece, the twenty-three prints of the Apocalypse.&lt;ref&gt;Marqusee. Jacobson, part II. Mayor, 358–359.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Netherlands===
[[File:GoltziusFarneseHerc.jpg|thumb|The "[[Farnese Hercules]]", engraving by [[Hendrick Goltzius|Goltzius]]]]

[[Cornelius Cort]] was an Antwerp engraver, trained in Cock's publishing house, with a controlled but vigorous style, and excellent at depicting dramatic lighting effects. He went to Italy and in 1565 was retained by [[Titian]] to produce prints of his paintings (Titian having secured his "privileges" or rights to exclusively reproduce his own works).  Titian took considerable trouble to get the effect he wanted; he said that Cort could not work from the painting alone, so he produced special [[drawing]]s for him to use. Eventually, the results were highly effective and successful, and after Titian's death Cort moved to Rome, where he taught a number of the most successful printmakers of the next generation, notably [[Hendrik Goltzius]], [[Francesco Villamena]] and [[Agostino Carracci]], the last major Italian artist to resist the spread of etching.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 403–407, 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goltzius, arguably the last great engraver, took Cort's style to its furthest point. Because of a childhood accident, he drew with his whole arm, and his use of the swelling line, altering the profile of the burin to thicken or diminish the line as it moved, is unmatched.  He was extraordinarily prolific, and the artistic, if not the technical, quality of his work is very variable, but his finest prints look forward to the energy of Rubens, and are as sensuous in their use of line as he is in paint.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 419–421. Spangeberg, 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time [[Pieter Brueghel the elder]], another Cort-trained artist, who escaped to paint, was producing prints in a totally different style; beautifully drawn but simply engraved.  He only etched one plate himself, a superb landscape, the ''Rabbit Hunters'', but produced many drawings for the Antwerp specialists to work up, of peasant life, satires, and newsworthy events.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 422–426.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, numerous other engravers in the Netherlands continued to produce vast numbers of reproductive and illustrative prints of widely varying degrees of quality and appeal—the two by no means always going together. Notable dynasties, often publishers as well as artists,  include the [[Wierix family]], the Saenredams, and [[Aegidius Sadeler]] and several of his relations. [[Philippe Galle]] founded another long-lived family business. [[Theodor de Bry]] specialised in illustrating books on new colonial areas.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 373–376, 408–410.&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th century==
[[File:Rembrandt aux yeux hagards.jpg|thumb|left|Self-portrait by [[Rembrandt]], 1630]]

The 17th century saw a continuing increase in the volume of commercial and reproductive printmaking; [[Rubens]], like Titian before him, took great pains in adapting the trained engravers in his workshop to the particular style he wanted, though several found his demands too much and left.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 427–432.&lt;/ref&gt; The generation after him produced a number of widely dispersed printmakers with very individual and personal styles; by now etching had become the normal medium for such artists.

[[Rembrandt]] bought a printing-press for his house in the days of his early prosperity, and continued to produce etchings (always so called collectively, although Rembrandt mixed techniques by adding engraving and drypoint to some of his etchings) until his bankruptcy, when he lost both house and press.  Fortunately his prints have always been keenly collected, and what seems to be a high proportion of his intermediate states have survived, often in only one or two impressions. He was clearly very directly involved in the printing process himself, and probably selectively wiped the plate of ink himself to produce effects ''surface tone'' on many impressions.  He also experimented continually with the effects of different papers. He produced prints on a wider range of subjects than his paintings, with several pure landscapes, many self-portraits that are often more extravagantly fanciful than his painted ones, some erotic (at any rate obscene) subjects, and a great number of religious prints. He became increasingly interested in strong lighting effects, and very dark backgrounds. His reputation as the greatest etcher in the history of the medium was established in his lifetime, and never questioned since. Few of his paintings left Holland whilst he lived, but his prints were circulated throughout Europe, and his wider reputation was initially based on them alone.&lt;ref&gt;White; Mayor, 472–505; Spangeberg, 164–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch artists of the century]]  produced original prints of quality, mostly sticking to the same categories of genre they painted.  The eccentric [[Hercules Seghers]] and [[Jacob van Ruysdael]] produced landscapes in very small quantities, [[Nicolaes Berchem]] and [[Karel Dujardin]] Italianate landscapes with animals and figures, and [[Adriaen van Ostade]] peasant scenes.  None was very prolific, but the Italianate landscape was the most popular type of subject; Berchem had a greater income from his prints than his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 467–471. Spangeberg, 156–158 (Seghers), 170 (van Ostade), 177 (Berchem).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Die Auferweckung das Lazarus (Castiglione).jpg|thumb|"The Raising of Lazarus", etching by [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione|Castiglione]]]]
[[File:Jacques Callot Massacre des Innocents.jpg|thumb|"Massacre of the Innocents", by [[Jacques Callot|Callot]], 13.7 x 10.5 cm, showing the use of multiple stoppings-out]]

[[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]] grew up in [[Genoa]] and was greatly influenced by the stays there of Rubens and [[van Dyck]] when he was a young artist. His etching technique was extremely fluent, and in all mediums he often repeats the same few subjects in a large number of totally different compositions. His early prints include a number of bravura treatments of classical and pastoral themes, whilst later religious subjects predominate.  He also produced a large series of small heads of exotically dressed men, which were often used by other artists. He was technically innovative, inventing the [[monotype]] and also the [[oil sketch]] intended to be a final product. He, like Rembrandt, was interested in [[chiaroscuro]] effects (contrasts of light and dark), using a number of very different approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Reed and Wallace, 262–271. Mayor, 526–527.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jusepe de Ribera]] may have learned etching in Rome, but all his fewer than thirty prints were made in [[Naples]] during the 1620s when his career as a painter seems to have been in the doldrums.  When the painting commissions began to flow again, he all but abandoned printmaking. His plates were sold after his death to a Rome publisher, who made a better job of marketing them than Ribera himself. His powerful and direct style developed almost immediately, and his subjects and style remain close to those of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Reed and Wallace, 279–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Bellange]] was a court painter in [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], a world that was to vanish abruptly in the [[Thirty Years War]] shortly after his death. No surviving painting of his can be identified with confidence, and most of those sometimes attributed to him are unimpressive. His prints, mostly religious, are Baroque extravaganzas that were regarded with horror by many 19th century critics, but have come strongly back into fashion—the very different Baroque style of another Lorraine artist [[Georges de La Tour]] has enjoyed a comparable revival. He was the first Lorraine printmaker (or artist) of stature, and must have influenced the younger [[Jacques Callot]], who remained in Lorraine but was published in [[Paris]], where he greatly influenced French printmaking.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths and Hartley. Jacobson, part X. Mayor, 453–460.&lt;/ref&gt;

Callot's technical innovations in improving the recipes for etching ground were crucial in allowing etching to rival the detail of engraving, and in the long term spelt the end of artistic engraving. Previously the unreliable nature of the grounds used meant that artists could not risk investing too much effort in an etched plate, as the work might be ruined by leaks in the ground. Equally, multiple stoppings-out, enabling lines etched to different depths by varying lengths of exposure to the acid, had been too risky.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 455–460.&lt;/ref&gt; Callot led the way in exploiting the new possibilities; most of his etchings are small but full of tiny detail, and he developed a sense of recession in landscape backgrounds in etching with multiple bitings to etch the background more lightly than the foreground. He also used a special etching needle called an ''échoppe'' to produce swelling lines like those created by the burin in an engraving, and also reinforced the etched lines with a burin after biting; which soon became common practice among etchers.  Callot etched a great variety of subjects in over 1400 prints, from grotesques to his tiny but extremely powerful series ''[[Les Grandes Misères de la guerre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hind (1923), 158–160.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Bosse]], a Parisian illustrative etcher popularized Callot's methods in a hugely successful manual for students. His own work is successful in his declared aim of making etchings look like engravings, and is highly evocative of French life at the middle of the century. 
[[File:6409 bassenge2vaillerant.jpg|thumb|left|Early [[mezzotint]] by [[Wallerant Vaillant]], Siegen's assistant or tutor]]

[[Wenzel Hollar]] was a [[Bohemia]]n ([[Czechs|Czech]]) artist who fled his country in the Thirty Years War, settling mostly in England (he was besieged at [[Basing House]] in the [[English Civil War]], and then followed his Royalist patron into a new exile in Antwerp, where he worked with a number of the large publishers there). He produced great numbers of etchings in a straightforward realist style, many topographical, including large [[Bird's-eye view|aerial views]], portraits, and others showing costumes, occupations and pastimes.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 344.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Stefano della Bella]] was something of an Italian counterpart to Callot, producing many very detailed small etchings, but also larger and freer works, closer to the Italian drawing tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Reed and Wallace, 234–243. Mayor, 520–521, 538, 545.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony van Dyck]] produced only a large series of portrait prints of contemporary notables, the ''Iconographia'' for which he only etched a few of the heads himself, but in a brilliant style, that had great influence on 19th century etching.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 433–435.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig von Siegen]] was a German soldier and courtier, who invented the technique of [[mezzotint]], which in the hands of better artists than he was to become an important, mostly reproductive, technique in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths (1980), 83–88. Mayor, 511–515.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last third of the century produced relatively little original printmaking of great interest, although illustrative printmaking reached a high level of quality. French portrait prints, most often copied from paintings, were the finest in Europe and often extremely brilliant, with the school including both etching and engraving, often in the same work. The most important artists were [[Claude Mellan]], an etcher from the 1630s onwards, and his contemporary {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean Morin (engraver)|fr|3=Jean Morin (artiste)}}, whose combination of engraving and etching influenced many later artists.  [[Robert Nanteuil]] was official portrait engraver to [[Louis XIV]], and produced over two hundred brilliantly engraved portraits of the court and other notable French figures.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 289–290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==
[[File:Piranesi-Ponte-Milvio.jpg|thumb|One of [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]]'s views of Rome]]

The extremely popular engravings of [[William Hogarth]] in England were little concerned with technical printmaking effects; in many he was producing reproductive prints of his own paintings (a surprisingly rare thing to do) that only set out to convey his crowded moral compositions as clearly as possible. It would not be possible, without knowing, to distinguish these from his original prints, which have the same aim. He priced his prints to reach a middle and even upper working-class market, and was brilliantly successful in this.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 550–555.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canaletto]] was also a highly successful painter, and though his relatively few prints are [[vedute]], they are rather different from his painted ones, and fully aware of the possibilities of the etching medium.  [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] was primarily a printmaker, a technical innovator who extended the life of his plates beyond what was previously possible.  His ''Views of Rome''—well over a hundred huge plates—were backed by a serious understanding of Roman and modern architecture and brilliantly exploit the drama both of the ancient ruins and Baroque Rome.  Many prints of Roman views had been produced before, but Piranesi's vision has become the benchmark.  [[Gianbattista Tiepolo]], near the end of his long career produced some brilliant etchings, subjectless capricci of a landscape of classical ruins and pine trees, populated by an elegant band of beautiful young men and women, philosophers in fancy dress, soldiers and satyrs.  Bad-tempered owls look down on the scenes.  His son Domenico produced many more etchings in a similar style, but of much more conventional subjects, often reproducing his father's paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 576–584.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technical means at the disposal of reproductive printmakers continued to develop, and many superb and sought-after prints were produced by the English [[mezzotint]]ers (many of them in fact Irish) and by French printmakers in a variety of techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths (1996), 134–158 on English mezzotints and their collectors.&lt;/ref&gt; French attempts to produce high quality colour prints were successful by the last part of the century, although the techniques were expensive.  Prints could now be produced that closely resembled [[drawing]]s in [[crayon]] or [[watercolour]]s. Some original prints were produced in these methods, but few major artists used them.&lt;ref&gt;Spangeberg, 221–222. Mayor, 591–600.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of the [[novel]] led to a demand for small, highly expressive, illustrations for them.  Many fine French and other artists specialised in these, but clearly standing out from the pack is the work of [[Daniel Chodowiecki]], a German of Polish origin who produced over a thousand small etchings. Mainly illustrations for books, these are wonderfully drawn, and follow the spirit of the times, through the cult of sentiment to the revolutionary and [[nationalist]] fervour of the start of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 568, 591–600.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Goya War2.jpg|thumb|One of ''[[Los desastres de la guerra]]'', [[aquatint]] by [[Goya]]]]
[[Goya]]'s superb but violent [[aquatint]]s often look as though they are illustrating some unwritten work of fiction, but their meaning must be elucidated from their titles, often containing several meanings, and the brief comments recorded by him about many of them. His prints show from early on the macabre world that appears only in hints in the paintings until the last years.  They were nearly all published in several series, of which the most famous are: ''Caprichos'' (1799), ''[[Los desastres de la guerra]]'' (''The Disasters of War'' from after 1810, but unpublished for fifty years after). Rather too many further editions were published after his death, when his delicate aquatint tone had been worn down, or reworked.&lt;ref&gt;Bareau. Mayor, 624–631.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Blake]] was as technically unconventional as he was in subject-matter and everything else, pioneering a relief etching process that was later to become the dominant technique of commercial illustration for a time. Many of his prints are pages for his books, with text and image on the same plate, as in the 15th century block-books.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 608–611. Spangeberg, 262.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantic Movement saw a revival in original printmaking in several countries, with Germany taking a large part once again; many of the [[Nazarene movement]] were printmakers.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths and Carey.&lt;/ref&gt; In England, [[John Sell Cotman]] etched many landscapes and buildings in an effective, straightforward style. [[J. M. W. Turner]] produced several print series including one, the ''[[Liber Studiorum]]'', which consisted of seventy-one etchings with mezzotint that were influential on landscape artists; according to Linda Hults, this series of prints amounts to "Turner's manual of landscape types, and&amp;nbsp;... a statement of his philosophy of landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Hults, 522.&lt;/ref&gt; With the relatively few etchings of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] the period of the old master print can be said to come to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Spangeberg, 260–261&lt;/ref&gt; Printmaking was to revive powerfully later in the 19th and 20th centuries, in a great variety of techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 660 onwards. Spangeberg, 263 onwards.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Painter and His Pug by William Hogarth.jpg|right|250px]]
'''''Painter and his Pug''''' is a 1745 [[self-portrait]] created by [[William Hogarth]]. He began the portrait a decade earlier. The portrait was originally created with the intention of Hogarth wearing formal attire, but was changed to the informal attire sometime during the painting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hogarth-the-painter-and-his-pug-n00112|title=The Painter and his Pug, William Hogarth|publisher=[[Tate Britain]]|date=August 2004|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also added his [[Pug]], [[Trump (dog)|Trump]].

In the portrait, Hogarth himself is in a painting as the [[pug]] is alongside him, making the dog "real" as opposed to the created person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seven Painters Who Changed the Course of Art History|first=Brian Thom McQuade|last=Ma|year=2012|page=120|isbn=9781477227411}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dog is indifferent to the painting, to the books and to the painting palette (which shows Hogarth's [[Line of Beauty]]). So the painting seems to be a [[Vanitas]] still life. But, as an ironic disruption, the cloth behind the dog comes out of the painting.

The painting is part of the collections of the Tate Gallery.

A '''panjdari''' ({{lang-fa|پنج‌دری}}) is a traditional element of vernacular [[Persian architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Fallāḥʹfar, Saʻīd (سعید فلاح‌فر). ''The Dictionary of Iranian Traditional Architectural Terms (Farhang-i vāzhahʹhā-yi miʻmārī-i sunnatī-i Īrān فرهنگ واژه‌های معماری سنتی ایران)''. Kamyab Publications (انتشارات کامیاب). Kāvushʹpardāz. 2000, 2010. Tehran. {{ISBN|978-964-2665-60-0}} US Library of Congress LCCN Permalink: http://lccn.loc.gov/2010342544 pp.52&lt;/ref&gt;

The word comes from "panj" (پنج ''five'') and "dar" (در ''window'' or ''door''), meaning "five windowed room".

By definition, a panjdari is a large room that is often flanked to the main [[talar]] of the house, and most often connected to a large [[balcony]], where five large contiguous windows provide primary views to the main courtyard of the house.

In modern terms, the room would be the equivalent of the living room of the house. However, traditional Persian houses were very large and had many rooms. The panjdari was therefore a main daily hub of the inhabitants.

[[File:Francesco Primaticcio 002.jpg|thumb|right|320px|''Odysseus and Penelope'' by [[Francesco Primaticcio]] (1563)]]
In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', '''Penelope''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|n|ɛ|l|ə|p|iː}} {{respell|pə|NEL|ə-pee}}; {{lang-el|Πηνελόπεια}}, ''Pēnelópeia'', or {{lang-el|Πηνελόπη}}, ''Pēnelópē'') is the wife of [[Odysseus]], who is known for her fidelity to Odysseus while he was absent, despite having many [[Suitors of Penelope|suitors]]. Her name has therefore been traditionally associated with marital fidelity.

==Etymology==
The origin of her name is believed by [[Robert S. P. Beekes]] to be [[Pre-Greek]] and related to ''pēnelops'' (πηνέλοψ)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] | title = Etymological Dictionary of Greek | publisher = Brill | year = 2009 | page = 1186}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''pēnelōps'' (πηνέλωψ), [[gloss (annotation)|glossed]] by [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] as "some kind of bird"&lt;ref&gt;[http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%93%CE%BB%CF%8E%CF543%83%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%B9/%CE%A0 Γλῶσσαι].&lt;/ref&gt; (today arbitrarily identified with the [[Eurasian wigeon]], to which [[Linnaeus]] gave the binomial ''Anas penelope''), where ''-elōps'' (-έλωψ) is a common Pre-Greek suffix for predatory animals;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Pape-1880/A/%CF%87%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CE%B1%CE%BB%E1%BD%BD%CF%80%CE%B7%CE%BE Zeno.org lemma] relating πηνέλωψ (gen. πηνέλοπος) and [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%93%CE%BB%CF%8E%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%B9/%CE%A7 &lt;χην(ά)λοπες&gt;· ὄρνεα (predators) ποιά. ὅπερ ἔνιοι &lt;χηναλώπεκες&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; however, the semantic relation between the proper name and the gloss is not clear. In [[folk etymology]], ''Pēnelopē'' (Πηνελόπη) is usually understood to combine the Greek word ''pēnē'' (πήνη), "[[weft]]", and ''ōps'' (ὤψ), "face", which is considered the most appropriate for a cunning weaver whose motivation is hard to decipher.&lt;ref&gt;For the mythology of weaving, see [[Weaving (mythology)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the ''Odyssey''==

Penelope is the wife of the main character, the king of [[Ithaca]], [[Odysseus]] (Ulysses in Roman mythology), and daughter of [[Icarius of Sparta]] and his wife [[Periboea]]. She only has one son by Odysseus, [[Telemachus]], who was born just before Odysseus was called to fight in the [[Trojan War]]. She waits twenty years for the final return of her husband,&lt;ref&gt;Odysseus spends ten years in the Trojan War and ten years [[Nostos|travelling home]].&lt;/ref&gt; during which she devises various strategies to delay marrying one of the 108&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Odyssey,'' Book XVI, in ''The Iliad &amp; The Odyssey''. Trans. Samuel Butler. p. 628. {{ISBN|978-1-4351-1043-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suitors of Penelope|suitors]] (led by [[Antinous son of Eupeithes|Antinous]] and including [[Agelaus]], [[Amphinomus]], Ctessippus, [[Demoptolemus]], [[Elatus]], Euryades, [[Eurymachus]] and [[Peisandros]]).

On Odysseus's return, disguised as an old beggar, he finds that Penelope has remained faithful. She has devised tricks to delay her suitors, one of which is to pretend to be weaving a burial shroud for Odysseus's elderly father [[Laertes]] and claiming that she will choose a suitor when she has finished. Every night for three years, she undoes part of the shroud, until [[Melantho]], one of twelve unfaithful serving women, discovers her chicanery and reveals it to the suitors.
[[File:Simmons - Penelope De Young Museum 1991.68 left side.JPG|alt=Penelope by Franklin Simmons, marble, 1896.|thumb|''Penelope'' by Franklin Simmons, marble, 1896.  On display at the De Young Museum in San Francisco.]]
Because of her efforts to put off remarriage, Penelope is often seen as a symbol of connubial fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Mackail, ''Penelope in the Odyssey'' (Cambridge University Press, 1916)&lt;/ref&gt; But because [[Athena]] wants her "to show herself to the wooers, that she might set their hearts a-flutter and win greater honor from her husband and her son than heretofore", Penelope does eventually appear before the suitors (xviii.160–162). As Irene de Jong comments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As so often, it is Athena who takes the initiative in giving the story a new direction ... Usually the motives of mortal and god coincide, here they do not: Athena wants Penelope to fan the Suitors’ desire for her and (thereby) make her more esteemed by her husband and son; Penelope has no real motive ... she simply feels an unprecedented impulse to meet the men she so loathes ... adding that she might take this opportunity to talk to [[Telemachus]] (which she will indeed do).&lt;ref&gt;Irene de Jong. (2001). ''A Narratological commentary on the Odyssey'', p.&amp;nbsp;445. Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-46844-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Antoine Bourdelle - Pénélope 1912 - Montauban.jpg|thumb|left|''Penelope'', bronze by [[Emile-Antoine Bourdelle]]]]
She is ambivalent, variously asking [[Artemis]] to kill her and, apparently, considering marrying one of the suitors. When the disguised Odysseus returns, she announces in her long interview with the disguised hero that whoever can string Odysseus's rigid bow and shoot an arrow through twelve axe heads may have her hand. "For the plot of the ''Odyssey'', of course, her decision is the turning point, the move that makes possible the long-predicted triumph of the returning hero".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Knox]]. (1996). ''Introduction to [[Robert Fagles]]'s translation of '''The Odyssey''''' p.&amp;nbsp;55.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate as to whether Penelope is aware that Odysseus is behind the disguise.  Penelope and the suitors know that Odysseus (were he in fact present) would easily surpass all in any test of masculine skill, so she may have intentionally started the contest as an opportunity for him to reveal his identity.  On the other hand, because Odysseus seems to be the only person (perhaps excepting Telemachus) who can actually use the bow, she could just be further delaying her marriage to one of the suitors.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

When the contest of the bow begins, none of the suitors are able to string the bow, but Odysseus does, and wins the contest. Having done so, he proceeds to slaughter the suitors—beginning with Antinous whom he finds drinking from Odysseus' cup—with help from Telemachus, Athena and two servants, [[Eumaeus]] the [[swineherd]] and [[Philoetius]] the [[Pastoral farming|cowherd]]. Odysseus has now revealed himself in all his glory (with a little makeover by Athena); yet Penelope cannot believe that her husband has really returned—she fears that it is perhaps some god in disguise, as in the story of [[Alcmene]]—and tests him by ordering her servant [[Euryclea|Eurycleia]] to move the bed in their bridal-chamber. Odysseus protests that this cannot be done since he made the bed himself and knows that one of its legs is a living [[olive tree]]. Penelope finally accepts that he truly is her husband, a moment that highlights their ''homophrosýnē'' (ὁμοφροσύνη, "like-mindedness").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=Norman|title=Archery at the Dark of the Moon: Poetic Problems in Homer's Odyssey|date=1975|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Homer implies, that from then on, Odysseus would live a long and happy life together with Penelope and Telemachus, wisely ruling his kingdom and enjoying wide respect and much success.&lt;ref&gt;Lawall, Thalman, Patterson, James, Spacks. "The Norton Anthology: Western Literature."[[The Odyssey]]". New York, London. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some early sources such as [[Pindar]], Pan's father is [[Apollo]] via Penelope.&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, Fr. 90 ([[Maurice Bowra|Bowra]])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] (2.145), [[Cicero]] (''[[De Natura Deorum|ND]]'' 3.22.56), [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]] (7.38) and [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] (''[[Fabulae]]'' 224) all make Hermes and Penelope his parents. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 8.12.5 records the story that Penelope had in fact been unfaithful to her husband, who banished her to Mantineia upon his return. 5th-century AD source ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' by [[Nonnus]] (14.92) names Penelope of [[Mantineia]] in Arcadia Pan's mother. Other sources ([[Duris of Samos]]; the Vergilian commentator [[Servius]]) report that Penelope slept with all 108 suitors in Odysseus' absence, and gave birth to Pan as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QKMNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA305 Footnote in the ''Library'' by Apollodorus (of Athens)], edited by E. Capps Ph.D, LL.D.; T. E. Page, Litt.D.; W. H. D. Rouse, Litt.d.; Webster Collection of Social Anthropology, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; This myth reflects the folk etymology that equates Pan's name (Πάν) with the Greek word for "all" (πᾶν).&lt;ref&gt;The [[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Pan]] provides the earliest example of this wordplay, suggesting that Pan's name was born from the fact that he delighted "all" the gods.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Ring Penelope CdM Luynes 515.jpg|thumb|upright|Gold [[Intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] ring, Syria, last quarter of the 5th century BC ([[Louvre Museum]])]]

Penelope is recognizable in Greek and Roman works, from Attic vase-paintings—the Penelope Painter is recognized by his representations of her—to Roman sculpture copying or improvising upon classical Greek models, by her seated pose, by her reflective gesture of leaning her cheek on her hand, and by her protectively crossed knees, reflecting her long chastity in Odysseus' absence, an unusual pose in any other figure.&lt;ref&gt;But compare, for an unusual exception, the seated ''aulos'' player on the "[[Ludovisi Throne]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin tradition==
Latin references to Penelope revolved around the sexual loyalty to her absent husband. It suited the marital aspect of Roman society representing the tranquility of the worthy family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mactoux|first=Marie-Madeleine|title=Pénélope: Légende et Mythe|date=1975|publisher=Annales Litteraires de L'Universite de Basancon|location=Paris|pages=129–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is mentioned by various classical authors including [[Plautus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nixon|first=Paul|title=Plautus|date=1968|publisher=William Heinemann Ltd|location=London}} She is mentioned in the opening lines of the play Stychus&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Propertius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Propertius|title=Complete Elegies of Propertius|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton and Oxford}}see Elegies 2.6; 2.9 and 3.12. Propertius was one of the few Latin authors to mention Penelope's weaving ruse.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace]], [[Ovid]], [[Martial]] and [[Statius]].  The use of Penelope in Latin texts provided a basis for her ongoing use in the Middle Ages and Renaissance as a representation of the chaste wife. This was reinforced by her being named by [[Saint Jerome]] among pagan women famed for their chastity.

[[Image:Piteado2.jpg|thumb|175px|Punteador at work in talabartería]]
[[Image:Piteado3.jpg|thumb|175px|Variety of piteado belts]]

'''Piteado''' is an artisan technique where pita or ixtle (thread made from the fiber of the [[Agave americana|century plant]]) is [[embroidery|embroidered]] onto leather in decorative patterns. The technique is used to make belts, sandals, hair bands, saddles, and other leather accessories. The technique is popular in [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]], and typical designs include flowers, animals, [[charrería|charreada]], and Pre-Hispanic symbols.

[[Jalisco]], a Mexican State was famous for this type of handicraft, especially the town of Colotlan. This region has become a big producer of two kinds of non-traditional piteado industry. One which uses automated manufacturing embroidery machines to make imitation piteado products and one where non-precious silvery and golden wires are inserted in leather works which are then fraudulently traded as genuine gold and silver.

The piteado work is a traditional art craft made by hand used in some Mexican Folklore, and  has spread to several communities in other Mexican states, including [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[Guerrero]], [[Veracruz]], [[San Luis Potosi]], [[State of Mexico]], [[Durango]], [[Zacatecas]], [[Guerrero]], [[Michoacán]], and [[Chiapas]].

Colotlán  a town of Jalisco call itself  piteado global capital, because there are many saddlers shops, and piteado dedicated craftsmen as a main source of income for its inhabitants. Each one of those piteado-workshop employs three types of workers, each dedicated to a specialized task: drawers, embroiderers, and ''punteadores''. There is an annual fair in promotion of local piteado artisan's art.

Hand embroidering a belt requires about 48 hours of labor. The kind of cactus thread used to embroidery is produced in Veracruz, Chiapas, and [[Oaxaca]]. 
Artisans from those regions make well-finished and more elaborate piteado works, but because of the lack of advertising and promotion, it is often not possible for them to sell to their intended market.

There is a foundation which promotes piteado in Veracruz, with branches in [[Florida]] and [[Shanghai]], which embraces, supports, and makes contributions of machinery and equipment to communities of artisans. This organization also encourages scientific research to improve the plant from which the cactus fiber is obtained, bringing together the communities involved. They connect farmers from northern Oaxaca with biochemical and agricultural researchers in the Guatemalan region of Mesaltenango, supporting the experimental designs of some new products, giving resources and support to those potential artisans with great innovative creations, and continuing to preserve these natural non-renewable resources. The group encourages the improvement of the process of manufacturing some traditional products already on the market, the continued propagation of the art form, and the preservation of the history behind it.

[[File:London - The Royal Society of Arts.jpg|thumb|right|The Royal Society of Arts, back of the building in [[London]], [[England]]]]

'''The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce''' ('''RSA''') is a [[London]]-based, British organisation committed to finding practical solutions to social challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/about-us|title=About the RSA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1754 by [[William Shipley]] as the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufacture and Commerce, it was granted a [[Royal Charter]] in 1847,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/about-us/history-and-archive/rsa-history-timeline|title=History of the RSA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201183144/http://www.thersa.org/about-us/history-and-archive/rsa-history-timeline|archivedate=1 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the right to use the term ''Royal'' in its name by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] in 1908.&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/nra/lists/GB-0403-RSA.htm|title=The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce: records|author=|date=|website=nationalarchives.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shorter version, '''The Royal Society of Arts''' and the related '''RSA''' acronym, are used more frequently than the full name.

Notable past fellows include [[Charles Dickens]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Nelson Mandela]], [[David Attenborough]], [[William Hogarth]], [[John Diefenbaker]], and [[Tim Berners-Lee]]. Today, the RSA has [[Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts|Fellows]] elected from 80 countries worldwide.

The RSA award three medals, the [[Albert Medal (RSA)|Albert Medal]], the [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Royal Society of Arts)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] (following a decision by the Board in 2013, the Benjamin Franklin Medal is now overseen by the RSA US, although the final nomination is ratified by the UK Board) and the Bicentenary Medal. Medal winners include [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Frank Whittle|Sir Frank Whittle]], and [[Professor]] [[Stephen Hawking]]. The RSA members are innovative contributors to the human knowledge, as shown by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which records the first use of the term "[[sustainability]]" in an environmental sense of the word in the ''RSA Journal'' in 1980.

Life Fellows must have demonstrated exceptionally high achievement. The RSA says: "The RSA Fellowship is an international community [of] achievers and influencers from a wide array of backgrounds and professions, distinguished by the title 'FRSA'. Fellows are social entrepreneurs to scientists, community leaders to commercial innovators, artists and journalists to architects and engineers, and many more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/fellowship|title=Fellowship - RSA|first=|last=RSA|date=|website=www.thersa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows of the RSA are entitled to use the [[post-nominal letters]] '''FRSA'''.

==Prizes==
Originally modelled on the [[Royal Dublin Society|Dublin Society for improving Husbandry, Manufacturers and other Useful Arts]], the RSA, from its foundation, offered ''prizes'' through a Premium Award Scheme that continued for 100 years. Medals and, in some cases, money were awarded to individuals who achieved success in published challenges within the categories of Agriculture, Polite Arts, Manufacture, Colonies and Trade, Chemistry and Mechanics. Successful submission included agricultural improvements in the cultivation of crops and reforestation, devising new forms of machinery, including an extendable ladder to aid firefighting that has remained in use relatively unchanged, and artistic skill, through submissions by young students, many of whom developed into famous artists i.e. [[Edwin Landseer]] who at the age of 10 was awarded a silver medal for his drawing of a dog.

The RSA originally specifically precluded premiums for [[patent]]ed solutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://sitoc.biz/adelphicharter/pdfs/RSA_IP_Final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Today the RSA continues to offer premiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/action-research-centre/enterprise-and-design/enterprise/premiums|title=RSA Premiums}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, the RSA awarded the first distinctions of [[Royal Designers for Industry]] (RDI or HonRDI), reserved for "those very few who in the judgment of their peers have achieved 'sustained excellence in aesthetic and efficient design for industry'".

In 1937 "The Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry" was established as an association with the object of "furthering excellence in design and its application to industrial purposes": membership of the Faculty is automatic for (and exclusive to) all RDIs and HonRDIs. The Faculty currently has 120 Royal Designers (RDI) and 45 Honorary Royal Designers (non-UK citizens who are awarded the accolade of HonRDI): the number of designers who may hold the distinction of RDI at any one time is strictly limited.

The Faculty consists of the world’s leading practitioners from fields as disparate as engineering, furniture, fashion and textiles, graphics, theater and film design. Early members include [[Eric Gill]], [[Enid Marx]], Sir [[Frank Whittle]] and numerous other household names.

==RSA House==
[[File:Mathew Taylor on the RSA.ogg|thumb|Audio description of the building by [[Matthew Taylor (Labour politician)|Mathew Taylor]]]]
The RSA moved to its current home in 1774. The House, situated in John Adam Street, near [[Strand, London|the Strand]] in central London, had been purpose-designed by the Adam Brothers ([[James Adam (architect)|James Adam]] and [[Robert Adam]]) as part of their innovative Adelphi scheme. The original building (6–8 John Adam Street) includes the Great Room, which features a magnificent sequence of paintings by Irish artist [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] titled ''The Progress of Human Knowledge and Culture'' and portraits of the Society's first and second presidents, painted by [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] respectively.

The RSA has expanded into adjacent buildings, and now includes 2 and 4 John Adam Street and 18 Adam Street. The first occupant of 18 Adam Street was the Adelphi Tavern, which is mentioned in Dickens's ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]''. The former private dining room of the Tavern contains a magnificent Adam ceiling with painted roundels by the school of Kauffman and Zucchi.

A major refurbishment in 2012 by Matthew Lloyd Architects won a [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] London Award in 2013, and a RIBA [[English Heritage]] Award for Sustaining the Historic Environment, also in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matthewlloyd.co.uk/projects/the-royal-society-of-arts/ The Royal Society of Arts], Matthew Lloyd Architects. Retrieved 11 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSA devised a scheme for commemorating the links between famous people and buildings, by placing plaques on the walls — these continue today as "[[blue plaque]]s" which have been administered by a range of government bodies. The first of these plaques was, in fact, of red terracotta erected outside a former residence of [[Lord Byron]] (since demolished). The Society erected 36 plaques until, in 1901, responsibility for them was transferred to the [[London County Council]] (which changed the colour of the plaques to the current blue) and, later, the [[Greater London Council]] (the G.L.C.) and, most recently, English Heritage. Similar schemes are now operated in all the [[Constituent countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries]] of the [[United Kingdom]].

==Associated organisations==
The origin of London's [[Royal Academy of Arts]] lies in an attempt in 1755 by members of the RSA (then simply known as the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce), principally the sculptor [[Henry Cheere]], to found an autonomous academy of arts to teach painting and sculpture. Prior to this a number of artists were members of the RSA, including Cheere and [[William Hogarth]], or were involved in small-scale private art academies, such as the [[St Martin's Lane Academy]]. Although Cheere's attempt failed, the eventual [[charter]], called an 'Instrument', used to establish the Royal Academy of Arts over a decade later was almost identical to that drawn up by Cheere and the RSA in 1755.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Sutton, ''Artisan or Artist?: A History of the Teaching of Art and Crafts in English Schools'' (London: Pergamon Press, 2014) p.297&lt;/ref&gt; The RSA also hosted the first ''exhibition of contemporary art'' in 1760. Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds were among those who exhibited at this first exhibition, and were subsequently founder members of The [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1768.

The Society was a pioneer in examinations, offering the first national public examinations in 1882 that led to the formation of the RSA Examinations Board now included in the [[OCR (examination board)|Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations Board]].

In 1876, a predecessor of the [[Royal College of Music]], the ''National Training School for Music'', was founded by the RSA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/41378132?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Jstor.Org RSA Journal Vol 140 Page 203, February 1992] Retrieved 19 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;


In 1929 The Society purchased the entire village of [[West Wycombe]]. After extensive repairs, the village was legally conveyed by deed to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 1936, the RSA awarded the first distinctions of [[Royal Designers for Industry]] (RDI or HonRDI), reserved for "those very few who in the judgment of their peers have achieved 'sustained excellence in aesthetic and efficient design for industry'".

==Activities==
In Great Britain and Ireland, the RSA offers regional activities to encourage Fellows to address local topics of interest and to connect with other Fellows in their locality. The UK Regions are: London, Central, North, Scotland, South East, South West, Wales and, Ireland. The RSA has a presence around the world under its RSA Global scheme with a notable presence in Australia, New Zealand and the USA.&lt;ref name=Fellowship&gt;[https://www.thersa.org/fellowship/in-your-area/international "Fellowship"], RSA.

===Events===

The RSA's public events programme is a key part of its charitable mission to make world-changing ideas and debate freely available to all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/events/about-events|title=About RSA events|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328204520/http://www.thersa.org/events/about-events|archivedate=28 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100 keynote lectures, panel discussions, debates, and documentary screenings are held each year, many of which are live-streamed over the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMo9vqiZPs0SuX-Xsj56_Drfw8V8O43MZ|title=RSA Replay channel on Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events are free and open to the public, and mp3 audio files&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events|title=Audio and past events|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315110127/http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events|archivedate=15 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and videos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/events/vision|title=RSA videos|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030233056/http://www.thersa.org/events/vision|archivedate=30 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; are made available on the RSA's website and YouTube page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/theRSAorg|title=RSA channel on Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renowned thinkers and doers have been invited to present their ideas on the RSA's stage ever since the society was founded in the 18th century "age of enlightenment". More recent speakers have included [[Sir Ken Robinson]], [[Al Gore]], [[Sir David Attenborough]], [[Alain de Botton]], [[Michael Sandel]], [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], [[Martha Nussbaum]], [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Susan Cain]], [[Dan Pink]], [[Dan Ariely]], [[Brene Brown]], [[Slavoj Zizek]], [[David Cameron]], and [[Dambisa Moyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/events/speakers|title=RSA Events Speakers|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327203035/http://www.thersa.org/events/speakers|archivedate=27 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of speaker for the recent annual Presidential lecture has been a matter of interest in the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danish professor Björn Lomborg, was chosen; his latest book, ''Cool It'', suggests that the imminent demise of polar bears is a myth. As president of the RSA, Prince Philip's first choice of speaker was Ian Plimer, professor of mineral geology at Adelaide University, but this was rejected as too controversial, as Plimer argues that the theory of Anthropogenic Global Warming is unproven.

On 14 January 2010, the RSA in partnership with Arts Council England hosted a one-day conference in London called "State of the Arts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thersa.org/events/state-of-the-arts-conference State of the Arts Conference], RSA.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of speakers from various disciplines from art to government gathered to talk about the state of the arts industry in the United Kingdom. Notable speakers included [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]] MP, Secretary of State for Culture, Media &amp; Sport and his counterpart [[Ben Bradshaw]] MP, who was then the Secretary of State for Culture, Media &amp; Sport. Notably, Jeremy Hunt stated that if the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] won the next elections then government funding for the arts would be cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/jan/14/arts-funding-cuts-proposed-conservatives|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|title=Arts funding cuts proposed by Conservatives|first=Charlotte|last=Higgins|date=14 January 2010|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RSA Animate (animation series)===
Excerpts from the events programme form the basis for the 10-minute [[whiteboard animation]]s as shown on the '''theRSAorg''' YouTube channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL39BF9545D740ECFF

The first 14 of these had gained 46 million views as of 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/oct/21/internet-users-animated-rsa-films | work=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | title=Internet users get animated about RSA short film series: Andrew Park's videos, which are drawn from capitalism and education speeches, have received 46m YouTube hits | first=Josh | last= Halliday | date=21 October 2011 | accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the no.1 nonprofit YouTube channel worldwide. The first animation in the RSA Animate series was based on [[Renata Salecl]]'s speech delivered for RSA on her book about choice.

A number of celebrity fans have tweeted about RSA Animates, including [[Yoko Ono]], [[Eric Schmidt]] and [[Milla Jovovich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/team63/status/22497441383194624|title= Milla Jovovich tweet}}{{Failed verification|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Projects===
During the 1980s, the RSA worked with the [[Comino Foundation]] and established a Comino Fellowship Committee 'to change the cultural attitude to industry from one of lack of interest or dislike to one of concern and esteem'. This eventually led to a joint government/industry initiative to promote 1986 as "Industry Year",&lt;ref&gt;Sir Geoffrey Chandler CBE, (1985) "Industry Year 1986", ''Industrial Management &amp; Data Systems,'' Vol. 85 Issue: 5/6, pp.6–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Powell (1986) "The Industry Year Attack", ''Production Engineer'' vol. 65. Issue: 1, pp.13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; with the RSA and the Comino Foundation providing core funding of £250,000 – which persuaded the [[Confederation of British Industry]] to raise £1 million and government departments to provide £3 million.&lt;ref name="Darbyshire"&gt;Darbyshire, Anthony, and Duckworth, Eric (2011), [http://www.cominofoundation.org.uk/PDF/Demetrius_Comino_a_life_and_legacy_of_achievement.pdf ''Demetrius Comino: A life and legacy of achievement''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514235835/http://www.cominofoundation.org.uk/PDF/Demetrius_Comino_a_life_and_legacy_of_achievement.pdf |date=14 May 2013 }}, Comino Foundation. Retrieved 22 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, the RSA became a sponsor of an [[Academy (English school)|academy]] in [[Tipton]], The [[RSA Academy]], which opened in September 2008. New buildings are currently under construction to designs by [[John McAslan and Partners]]. Current projects include Arts and Ecology, Citizen Power, Connected Communities, Design and Society, Education, Public Services, Social Brain, and Technology in a Cold Climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/projects|title=RSA Projects|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310020748/http://www.thersa.org/projects|archivedate=10 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are seven schools in the RSA Family of Academies, all in the West Midlands, including The RSA Academy and [[Whitley Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rsaacademiesteachingschool.org.uk/about-us/our-academies/ | title=Our Academies | publisher=Royal Society of Arts | work=RSA Teaching School Alliance | accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Past projects include delivering fresh drinking water to the developing world, rethinking intellectual property from first principles to produce a Charter (published as the [[Adelphi Charter]]), investigating schemes to manage international migration and exploring the feasibility of a UK-wide [[personal carbon trading]] system. It still promotes the practice of inclusive design, and is working with artists to communicate ideas about environmental sustainability (for example, through one of the RSA's past projects, [[WEEE Man]], and currently through the Arts and Ecology project).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9501">[[File:Tahmuras (The Shahnama of Shah Tahmasp).png|thumb|right|Tahmuras in the [[Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp]]]]
[[Image:Tahmurath-Lawrie-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Lee Lawrie]], ''Tahmurath'' (1939). Library of Congress [[John Adams Building]], Washington, D.C.]]
'''Tahmuras''' or '''Tahmures''' ({{lang-fa|تهمورث ,طهمورث}}, {{IPA-all|tʰæmures}}; from [[Avestan]] ''Taxma Urupi'') was the third [[Shah]] of the world according to [[Ferdowsi]]'s [[epic poetry|epic poem]], the ''[[Shahnameh]]''. He is considered the builder of [[Merv]].

==Tahmuras in the ''Shahnameh''==
Tahmures was the son of [[Hushang]].  In his time the world was much troubled by the [[Deev|''deev''s]] (demons) of [[Angra Mainyu|Ahriman]].  On the advice of his [[vizier]] [[Shahrasp]] ({{lang|fa|شهرسپ}}), Tahmuras used magic to subdue Ahriman and made him his slave, even riding upon his back as on a horse. The demons rebelled against Tahmuras, and he made war against them with both magic and force. By magic he bound two-thirds of the demons; the remaining third he crushed with his mace. The ''deevs'' now became Tahmuras's slaves and they taught him the art of writing in thirty different scripts.

Like his father, Tahmuras was a great inventor of arts for easing the human condition.  He invented the spinning and weaving of wool, learned to domesticate chickens, how to store up fodder for livestock instead of merely grazing them, and how to train animals like dogs and falcons to hunt for people.

Tahmuras ruled for thirty years and was succeeded by his son [[Jamshid]].

==Death of Taxmoruw, as told in a Parsi ''Rivayāt''==
[[Georges Dumézil]] provides a summary of a [[Ribaldry|bawdy]] and [[off-color humor|scatological]], but nonetheless instructive account of the death of Taxmoruw (Tahmuras) preserved in a [[Parsi]] ''[[rivayat|rivayāt]]'', translated by Danish orientalist and historian Arthur Christensen and published by [[Friedrich von Spiegel]].&lt;ref&gt;''Les types du premier homme et du premier roi dans l'histoire légendaire des Iraniens'' Part I (1917) by Christensen,Arthur pps. 184-189.&lt;/ref&gt;This (admittedly late) text furnishes material that Dumézil considers to preserve archaic [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] themes with a bearing on what he termed the problem of ''le borgne'' and ''le manchot'' i.e. of 'the one-eyed (god)' and 'the one-handed (god)' - relating, in this instance, specifically to the mythic motif of one-handedness.

The scene for this scurrilous episode is set by the account in the [[Avesta]] of the reign of Taxma Urupi, which relates that this sovereign of the world subdued not only demons and sorcerers, but also the archfiend Angra Mainyu himself, thanks to the help of the wind god [[Vayu-Vata|Vayu]] and his (Taxma Urupi's) possession of the [[khvarenah]] or mystic 'kingly glory'. Thus empowered, the valiant king is able to ride Angra Mainyu, like a horse, 'from one end of the earth to the other', every day for thirty years. (At this point the Avesta falls silent and the Parsi ''rivayât'' takes up the story). Ahriman (Angra Mainyu), exasperated by his undignified bondage as a beast of burden, manages finally to win (by means of a gift of jewellery) the confidence of Taxmoruw's wife, from whom he learns that there is a certain point on the daily ride - a particularly treacherous part of a mountain track - at which Taxmoruw experiences a moment of [[vertigo|vertiginous]] dread. The following day Ahriman bides his time until 'horse' and rider reach the critical point - at which he seizes his chance, rearing up, throwing Taxmoruw to the ground and swallowing the unfortunate king whole. Time passes, but Taxmoruw's corpse is not found, remaining in Ahriman's belly.

Meanwhile, [[Jamshid]], Taxmoruw's devoted brother (not son, as in the Shahnameh), scours the world in search of his body until eventually he learns from [[Sraosha|Srosh]], the well-nigh omniscient confidant of [[Ahura Mazda]], that it is hidden in Ahriman's bowels. Jamshid begs Srosh to tell him some magical trick to retrieve the body from its unsavoury resting place, whereupon Srosh reveals that Ahriman loves two things above all else : music and [[anal sex]]. Acting on Srôsh's advice, Jamshid then travels to the area where Ahriman is living and begins to sing. Attracted by the music, the demon duly appears and begins capering about and [[masturbation|masturbating]] in anticipation of his other favourite activity.

Jamshid agrees to penetrate Ahriman on condition that he first be allowed to remove Taxmoruw's body from the demon's bowels. The excited Ahriman agrees readily to the bargain and bends over, presenting his [[anus]], whereupon Jamshid plunges his hand up the demon's [[rectum]], deep into his belly, quickly pulls out his brother's corpse, places it on the ground and flees. Ahriman gives chase, but Jamshid runs on and on, taking care (as instructed previously by Srosh) not to look back at his pursuer and, more especially not to look him in the face. Ahriman tires and, baulked of both pleasure and prey, descends once more into hell.

Jamshid then returns to the spot where he left Taxmoruw's body, constructs the [[prototype|prototypical]] [[Tower of Silence]] and places the body on it for [[excarnation]] by birds of prey, in the manner still considered ritually correct by Zoroastrians to this day. Thankful that he has at last been able to give his brother a fitting funeral, Jamshid can finally take time to glance at the hand which has been up Ahriman's anus and sees, to his horror, that it is pale and stinking, starting to waste away with a foul disease similar to [[leprosy]]. The disease grows steadily worse, the hand withering and growing ever more painful, and Jamshid becomes sad at his deformity, shunning human society and haunting, hermit-like, the loneliest of mountains and deserts. All, however, ends happily, for one night, as the wretched man lies asleep, an [[ox]] [[urinates]] on his blighted hand, healing it. Thus comes about the discovery of ''gōmēz'' - cattle [[urine]], considered as the purificatory liquid ''par excellence'' in Zoroastrianism and used as such in the nine-night ritual of [[Barashnûm]], (as detailed in the 9th chapter of the [[Vendidad]]).

==Takhmurup and the Three Sacred Fires in the ''Bundahishn''==
According to verses 8-9 of the eighteenth chapter of the cosmological treatise known as the ''[[Bundahishn]]'', the three preeminent [[Atar]] (Great Fires) of ancient Iran - Farnbag, Gushnasp and Burzin Mihr - were brought thither on the back of the ox Srishok from a place named Khwaniratha, during the reign of the primordial ruler Takhmurup - presumably with his knowledge and possibly at his command. The text of the Bundahishn is not easy to interpret at this point, but seems to mean that a group of  men were riding beside the (Caspian?) sea on the back of the ox, transporting with them a fire altar, upon which were burning the three atar (holy fires). A storm then sprang up and the wind whipped the fire altar off Srishok's back and carried it out to sea. The three holy fires, however, were not quenched but miraculously remained burning on the waters, lighting the men (or passing seafarers?) to their (unspecified) destination.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avesta.org/mp/grb12.htm#chap18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Persian Mythology'', by Hinnells, John R., volume in the series ''Library of the World's Myths and Legends'' pub. Newnes Books 1985&lt;/ref&gt;The unusual concept of fire burning in the midst of water is found also in relation to the ancient Indo-Iranian deity [[Apam Napat]] and both occurrences of the mythological motif may owe something to early observation of flames (derived from the welling up of natural hydrocarbons) hovering near the surface of  the [[Caspian Sea]] - more specifically the Southwestern part, exploited currently by the [[Absheron gas field]] near [[Baku]] in [[Azerbaijan]].

==Erection of Shiraz==
According to certain [[Culture of Iran|Iranian traditions]], the city of [[Shiraz]] was originally built by Tahmures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Conder|first=Josiah|title=Persia and China|publisher=Printed for J. Duncan|date=1827}}, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; Some native writers have claimed that the name Shiraz is derived from that of Tahmuras's son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Conder|first=Josiah|title=Persia and China|publisher=Printed for J.

[[File:Asher B. Durand - Portrait of Thomas Cole - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of Thomas Cole'' by [[Asher Brown Durand|Asher B. Durand]], 1837.]]

'''''The Course of Empire''''' is a series of five paintings created by [[Thomas Cole]] in the years 1833–36. It is notable in part for reflecting popular American sentiments of the times, when many saw [[pastoralism]] as the ideal phase of human civilization, fearing that empire would lead to gluttony and inevitable decay.  The theme of cycles is one that Cole returned to frequently, such as in his ''[[The Voyage of Life]]'' series. ''The Course of Empire'' comprises the following works: ''The Course of Empire – The Savage State''; ''The Arcadian or Pastoral State''; ''The Consummation of Empire''; ''Destruction''; and ''Desolation''. All the paintings are 39.5&amp;nbsp;inches by 63.5&amp;nbsp;inches (100&amp;nbsp;cm by 161&amp;nbsp;cm) except ''The Consummation of Empire'' which is 51" by 76" (130&amp;nbsp;cm by 193&amp;nbsp;cm).

The series of paintings depicts the growth and fall of an imaginary city, situated on the lower end of a river valley, near its meeting with a bay of the sea.  The valley is distinctly identifiable in each of the paintings, in part because of an unusual landmark:  a large boulder is situated atop a crag overlooking the valley.  Some critics believe this is meant to contrast the immutability of the earth with the transience of man.

A direct source of literary inspiration for ''The Course of Empire'' paintings is [[Byron]]'s ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'' (1812–18).  Cole quoted lines from Canto IV in his newspaper advertisements for the series:&lt;ref&gt;Hay, John. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EEY3DwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=thomas+cole+byron+advertisement+empire&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Postapocalyptic Fantasies in Antebellum American Literature]''. Cambridge University Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|First freedom and then Glory – when that fails,&lt;br /&gt;

Cole designed these paintings to be displayed prominently in the picture gallery on the third floor of the mansion of his patron, [[Luman Reed]], at 13 [[Greenwich Street]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Series: The Course of Empire|url=http://www.explorethomascole.org/tour/items/69/series/|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The layout was approximately as shown here, according to Cole's installation diagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Installation Diagram for the Course of Empire|url=http://www.explorethomascole.org/gallery/items/303|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was acquired by The [[New-York Historical Society]] in 1858 as a gift of the New-York Gallery of Fine Arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emuseum.nyhistory.org/emuseum/view/objects/asitem/search$0040/23/title-asc?t:state:flow=dade77d2-6d87-41b6-8c1d-9644fd46ee6a New-York Historical Society eMuseum]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Savage State''===
[[Image:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Savage State 1836.jpg|thumb|350px|''The Savage State''. Oil on canvas, 1834, 39 ½ × 63 ½ in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.explorethomascole.org/tour/items/63 |title=The Course of Empire: The Savage State |author= |date= |work= |publisher=ExploreThomasCole |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The first painting, ''The Savage State'', shows the valley from the shore opposite the crag, in the dim light of a dawning stormy day. A hunter clad in skins hastens through the wilderness, pursuing a deer; canoes paddle up the river; on the far shore can be seen a clearing with a cluster of tipis around a fire, the nucleus of the city that is to be.  The visual references are those of aboriginal North American life. This painting depicts the ideal state of the natural world. It is a healthy world, unchanged by humanity.

===''The Arcadian or Pastoral State''===
[[Image:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State 1836.jpg|thumb|350px|''The Arcadian or Pastoral State''. Oil on canvas, 1834, 39 ½ × 63 ½ in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.explorethomascole.org/tour/items/65 |title=The Course of Empire: The Arcadian or Pastoral State |author= |date= |work= |publisher=ExploreThomasCole |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the second painting, ''The [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadian]] or Pastoral State'', the sky has cleared and we are in the fresh morning of a day in spring or summer. The viewpoint has shifted further down the river, as the crag with the boulder is now on the left-hand side of the painting; a forked peak can be seen in the distance beyond it. Much of the wilderness has given way to settled lands, with plowed fields and lawns visible. Various activities go on in the background: plowing, boat-building, herding sheep, dancing; in the foreground, an old man sketches what may be a geometrical problem with a stick. On a bluff on the near side of the river, a [[megalithic]] temple has been built, and smoke (presumably from sacrifices) arises from it.  The images reflect an idealized, pre-urban ancient Greece. This work shows humanity at peace with the land. The environment has been altered, but not so much so that it or its inhabitants are in danger.

===''The Consummation of Empire''===
[[Image:Cole Thomas The Consummation The Course of the Empire 1836.jpg|thumb|350px|''The Consummation of Empire''. Oil on canvas, 1836, 51 × 76 in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.explorethomascole.org/tour/items/67 |title=The Course of Empire: The Consummation of Empire |author= |date= |work= |publisher=ExploreThomasCole |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Paintings|url=http://beyondthenotes.org/empire/index.html|website=Beyond the Notes: The Course of Empire|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The third painting, ''The Consummation of Empire'', shifts the viewpoint to the opposite shore, approximately the site of the clearing in the first painting.  It is noontide of a glorious summer day. Both sides of the river valley are now covered in colonnaded marble structures, whose steps run down into the water. The megalithic temple seems to have been transformed into a huge domed structure dominating the river-bank. The mouth of the river is guarded by two [[wikt:pharos|pharoi]], and ships with lateen sails go out to the sea beyond.  A joyous crowd throngs the balconies and terraces as a scarlet-robed king or victorious general crosses a bridge connecting the two sides of the river in a triumphant procession.  In the foreground an elaborate fountain gushes.  The look of the painting suggests the height of ancient Rome. The decadence seen in every detail of this cityscape foreshadows the inevitable fall of this mighty civilization.
{{Clear}}

===''Destruction''===
[[Image:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire Destruction 1836.jpg|thumb|350px|''Destruction''. Oil on canvas, 1836, 39 ½ × 63 ½ in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.explorethomascole.org/tour/items/69 |title=The Course of Empire: Destruction |author= |date= |work= |publisher=ExploreThomasCole |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The fourth painting, ''Destruction'', has almost the same perspective as the third, though the artist has stepped back a bit to allow a wider scene of the action, and moved almost to the center of the river. The action is the sack  and destruction of the city, in the course of a tempest seen in the distance.  It seems that a fleet of enemy warriors has overthrown the city's defenses, sailed up the river, and is busily firing the city and killing and raping its inhabitants. The bridge across which the triumphant procession had crossed is broken; a makeshift crossing strains under the weight of soldiers and refugees. Columns are broken, fire breaks from the upper floors of a palace on the river bank.

In the foreground a statue of some venerable hero (posed like the [[Borghese Warrior]]) stands headless, still striding forward into the uncertain future.{{efn|The artist name and date 1836 can just be seen on the base of the statue}} In the waning light of late afternoon, the dead lie where they fell, in fountains and atop the monuments built to celebrate the affluence of the now fallen civilization. The scene is perhaps suggested by the [[Vandals|Vandal]] [[Sack of Rome (455)|sack of Rome]] in 455. On the other hand, a detail in the lower right of "The Consummation of Empire" shows two children fighting, one clad in red and the other in green—the colors of banners of the two contending forces in "Destruction," which thus might depict a foreshadowed civil war.

===''Desolation''===
[[Image:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire Desolation 1836.jpg|thumb|350px|''Desolation''. Oil on canvas, 1836, 39 ½ × 63 ½ in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.explorethomascole.org/tour/items/71 |title=The Course of Empire: Desolation |author= |date= |work= |publisher=ExploreThomasCole |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The fifth painting, ''Desolation'', shows the results, decades later. We view the remains of the city in the livid light of a dying day. The landscape has begun to return to wilderness, and no humans are to be seen; but the remnants of their architecture emerge from beneath a mantle of trees, ivy, and other overgrowth. The broken stumps of the pharoses loom in the background. The arches of the shattered bridge, and the columns of the temple are still visible; a single column looms in the foreground, now a nesting place for birds. The sunrise of the first painting is mirrored here by a moonrise, a pale light reflecting in the ruin-choked river while the standing pillar reflects the last rays of sunset. This gloomy picture suggests how all empires could be after their fall. It is a harsh possible future in which humanity has been destroyed by its own hand.

This cycle reflects Cole's pessimism, and is often seen as a commentary on [[Andrew Jackson]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. (Note, for instance, the military hero at the centre of "Consummation.")&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Kohl, ''The Politics of Individualism: Parties and the American Character in the Jacksonian Era'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Democrats had a different theory of the course of empire. They saw not a spiral or cycle but a continuing upward trajectory. [[Levi Woodbury]], a Democrat and a justice of the United States Supreme Court, for instance, responded to Cole by saying that there would be no destruction in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred L. Brophy, "Property and Progress: Antebellum Landscape Art and Property Law," ''McGeorge Law Review'' 40 (2009): 601.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Favourite''''' is a 2018 [[historical period drama|historical period]] [[comedy-drama]] film&lt;ref name=allmovie/&gt;  directed by [[Yorgos Lanthimos]], from a screenplay written by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara. A co-production of Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States, the story focuses on the behind-the-scenes politics between two cousins jockeying to be [[favourite|court favourites]] during the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in the early 18th century. It stars [[Olivia Colman]], [[Emma Stone]], [[Rachel Weisz]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Joe Alwyn]], [[James Smith (actor)|James Smith]], and [[Mark Gatiss]]. Filming took place at Hatfield House in [[Hertfordshire]] and [[Hampton Court Palace]], [[Richmond upon Thames]], between March and May 2017.

''The Favourite'' had its world premiere at the [[75th Venice International Film Festival]] on 30 August 2018, where it won two awards: the [[Grand Jury Prize (Venice Film Festival)|Grand Jury Prize]] and the [[Volpi Cup for Best Actress]] (for Colman). It was then theatrically released in the United States on 23 November 2018, by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]].&lt;ref name="InComp1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/venice-film-festival-unveils-full-lineup-1129426 |title=Venice to Kick Off Awards Season With New Films From Coen Brothers, Luca Guadagnino and Alfonso Cuaron |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Ariston |last=Anderson |date=25 July 2018 |accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InComp2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/venice-film-festival-full-lineup-1202883737/ |title=Venice Film Festival Lineup: Heavy on Award Hopefuls, Netflix and Star Power |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Nick |last=Vivarelli |date=25 July 2018 |accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was praised for its direction, screenplay, cinematography, music, costume design, production values, and the lead performances from Colman, Stone and Weisz. At the [[Gotham Independent Film Awards]] the three actresses won a special Jury Award for Ensemble Performance.

==Plot==
England is at war with the French, and a frail [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] (Colman) sits on the throne. Her confidant, adviser, and secret lover [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah Churchill]] (Weisz), the Duchess of Marlborough, effectively rules the country by the confidences she instructs to the Queen. Sarah's efforts to control Anne are undermined by [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]] (Hoult), a member of Parliament and influential landowner responsible for bringing in state taxes for the war.

[[Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham|Abigail Hill]] (Stone), Sarah's younger cousin, arrives at court in search of employment. Abigail's history is tainted by her father, who has gambled away his good name and previously handed over his daughter to settle his debts to a German. Abigail does menial work in the castle, but impresses Anne and Sarah with her grace and charm. When she learns of Anne and Sarah's secret relationship, she begins planning her own ascent to win the Queen's [[Favourite|favor]].

While Sarah is focused on the war effort, Abigail takes advantage of her preoccupation to form a friendship (and later, sexual relationship) with Anne. When Sarah becomes wise to Abigail's machinations and attempts to have her sent away, Abigail poisons her tea; Sarah is rendered unconscious while horseback riding, and goes missing for several days. In Sarah's absence, Abigail secures Anne's permission to marry [[Samuel Masham]] (Alwyn), a baron in Anne's court.

Upon Sarah's return to court, she issues an ultimatum to Anne: send Abigail away, or she will leak to the press the letters between Sarah and Anne that detail their sexual relationship. The threat destroys the relationship between Anne and Sarah; though Sarah voluntarily burns the letters in penance, she is ultimately stripped of her offices and sent away from court. When Abigail, now promoted to [[Keeper of the Privy Purse]], presents what she claims to be evidence that Sarah had been [[Embezzlement|embezzling]] money, Sarah is exiled from England. Abigail, having secured her goal of a place in court and the aristocracy, is ordered by a taciturn Anne to massage her legs without speaking.

==Production==
===Writing and development===
Deborah Davis had written the script for ''The Favourite'' as early as 1998, when it was then titled ''The Balance of Power''. Davis admitted to having little knowledge of the Queen and her relationships with Sarah and Abigail: "As a historian who studied history at university and someone who had a lifelong history, I knew nothing about Queen Anne and I knew nothing about this relationship. So, I set myself the task of finding out about Sarah and Queen Anne and very quickly stumbled on the story about women in power and a female triangle." Davis subsequently compiled and studied the letters written by Queen Anne, Sarah, and Abigail: "I did a lot of research and as it turns out, there is a wealth of original sources. You have historical accounts of the period. One of the best sources is [[Winston Churchill]] who wrote the story about his ancestor who was the Duke of Marlborough and he covers the female triangle and the relationship between Anne, Sarah and Abigail in his four-part biography. There are enormous amounts of sources out there. Another one was, of course, Sarah’s memoir where she wrote about how she was replaced in the Queen’s favor by Abigail and how Abigail had become the absolute favorite." Discussing the process of getting the film produced, Davis stated:

{{quote|"I wrote the first draft in 1998 and I had no experience in scriptwriting. I took myself to night school to learn. I took that first draft to Ceci Dempsey and she was very interested in it [...] She had never ever wavered in her support and passion for this project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/2018/11/05/deborah-davis-talks-to-awards-daily-about-the-favourites-twenty-year-journey-to-the-big-screen/|title=Deborah Davis Talks To Awards Daily About The Favourite’s Twenty Year Journey To The Big Screen|website=Awards Daily|first=Jazz|last=Tangcay|date=5 November 2018|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Producer Ceci Dempsey possessed an early draft of the script and found herself "haunted" by "the passion, the survival instincts of these women, the manipulations and what they did to survive." However, Dempsey had difficulty securing financing at the time, due to the lesbian content, as well as the lack of male representation, which financers felt would be challenging to market. Almost a decade later, producer Ed Guiney got hold of the script, and was similarly attracted to the complicated plot and relationships of the three women. “We didn't want to make just another British costume drama," he stated, "[we wanted] a story that felt contemporary and relevant and vibrant — not something out of a museum.” During this time, Guiney became acquainted with [[Yorgos Lanthimos]], whose film ''[[Dogtooth (film)|Dogtooth]]'' (2009) received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]], and approached him with the prospect of directing the film. Lanthimos immediately became intrigued with “[t]hese three women possessed power that affected the lives of millions,” and at the same time found the story to be “intimate” as well. Lanthimos then began working closely with screenwriter Tony McNamara on “freshening up” the script. By 2013, the producers were receiving financing offers from several companies, including [[Film4 Productions]] and Waypoint Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/features/favourite-blows-up-metoo-gender-politics-love-triangle-1160665|title='The Favourite' Blows Up Gender Politics With the Year's Most Outrageous Love Triangle|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Tatiana|last=Siegel|date=November 14, 2018|accessdate=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, it was announced that Yorgos Lanthimos would direct the film, from a screenplay by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, which was described as "a bawdy, acerbic tale of royal intrigue, passion, envy, and betrayal."&lt;ref name="wrap"/&gt; Ceci Dempsey, [[Ed Guiney]], Lee Magiday, and [[Andrew Lowe]] served as producers under their Scarlet Films and Element Pictures banners, respectively.&lt;ref name="Jafaar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/09/kate-winslet-emma-stone-olivia-colman-yorgos-lanthimos-the-favourite-element-pictures-scarlet-queen-anne-1201548277/|title=Emma Stone &amp; Olivia Colman In Talks To Board Yorgos Lanthimos' 'The Favourite'|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Ali|last=Jafaar|date=24 September 2015|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first film in which neither Lanthimos nor his frequent collaborator [[Efthymis Filippou]] serve as screenwriters, but Lanthimos was nonetheless attracted to Davis' and McNamara's script, and "became acquainted with the three female characters who happened to be real people. I felt that it was an interesting story in its own right, but you also have the opportunity to create three complex female characters which is something you rarely see."&lt;ref name="colman"/&gt; Of her working relationship with Lanthimos, Dempsey said:

{{quote|“He has a very particular, contained view. And he reserves it and conserves it, deliberately. He’s very intuitive on every level. Casting, yes. Even hiring the department, it’s all the same process [...] You’re not going to talk him into anything ever, ever, ever, ever.

In regards to the film's plot, specifically the lesbian-centric love triangle, Lanthimos stated that "My instinct from the beginning was that I didn't want this to become an issue in the film, for us, like we're trying to make a point out of it [...] I didn't even want the characters in the film to be making an issue of it. I just wanted to deal with these three women as human beings. It didn't matter that there were relationships of the same gender. I stopped thinking about that very early on in the process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/09/yorgos-lanthimos-the-favourite-lesbian-love-triangle-1201999899/|title=Yorgos Lanthimos on the Lesbian Love Triangle of 'The Favourite': 'I Didn't Want This to Become an Issue'|website=[[IndieWire]]|first=Eric|last=Kohn|date=3 September 2018|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lanthimos also elaborated on the "positive" effect the [[Me Too movement]] had on the film: "Because of the prevalent male gaze in cinema, women are portrayed as housewives, girlfriends… Our small contribution is we're just trying to show them as complex and wonderful and horrific as they are, like other human beings."&lt;ref name="colman"/&gt;

In September 2015, it was announced that [[Emma Stone]], [[Olivia Colman]] and [[Kate Winslet]] had been cast in the film, portraying Abigail Masham, Queen Anne, and Sarah Churchill, respectively.&lt;ref name="Jafaar"/&gt; By October 2015, [[Rachel Weisz]] joined the cast of the film, replacing Winslet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/10/rachel-weisz-yorgos-lanthimos-the-favourite-emma-stone-olivia-colman-1201584014/|title=Rachel Weisz In Talks To Reunite With Yorgos Lanthimos In 'The Favourite'|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Ali|last=Jafaar|date=15 October 2015|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes as the second collaboration between Lanthimos, Colman, and Weisz, all of whom previously worked together on Lanthimos' ''[[The Lobster]]'' (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yorgos Lanthimos commences The Lobster shoot|url=http://www.cineuropa.org/nw.aspx?t=newsdetail&amp;l=en&amp;did=254300|work=Cineuropa|date=31 March 2014|accessdate=11 May 2014|last=Ramachandran|first=Naman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, [[Nicholas Hoult]] joined the cast of the film, followed by [[Joe Alwyn]], in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/02/nicholas-hoult-emma-stone-rachel-weisz-the-favourite-movie-1202030153/|title=Nicholas Hoult Joins Emma Stone And Rachel Weisz In 'The Favourite'|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Anita|last=Busch|date=28 February 2017|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/billy-lynn-star-joe-alwyn-joins-emma-stone-favourite-983036|title='Billy Lynn' Star Joe Alwyn Joins Emma Stone in 'The Favourite' (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|first=Rebecca|last=Ford|date=3 March 2017|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August 2018, [[Mark Gatiss]], [[James Smith (actor)|James Smith]], and Jenny Rainsford were announced as additional members of the cast.&lt;ref name="centerpiece"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/yorgos-lanthimos-the-favourite-london-film-festival-centerpiece-1202900434/|title=Yorgos Lanthimos' 'The Favourite' to Be London Film Festival Centerpiece|website=Variety|first=Henry|last=Chu|date=8 August 2018|accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The casting for the film was crucial for Lanthimos, who describes his process as "instinctive", stating: "It's one of those things when you feel you're right and you need to insist no matter what." Colman was his first and only choice for Queen Anne, and she readily accepted, despite having portrayed [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] in ''[[Hyde Park on Hudson]]'' (2012) and [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in ''[[The Crown (TV series)|The Crown]]''. After Winslet left the project, Lanthimos approached [[Cate Blanchett]] for the role of Sarah, who turned down the offer due to “timing issues”, after which he approached Weisz, who accepted the role. For Abigail, Lanthimos agreed to allow Stone, whom he was only familiar with for her role in the comedy ''[[Crazy, Stupid, Love]]'' (2011), to audition, only after she worked with a dialect coach for at least one month.

Colman readily accepted the role of Queen Anne, and stated that the difference between Anne and the previous queens she played was that “the other queens didn't get to fall in love with two hot women.” She also found that playing the Queen was "a joy because she sort of feels everything," and when asked if the character was nothing more than a petulant child, she stated that, "She's just a woman who is underconfident and doesn't know if anyone genuinely loves her. She has too much power, too much time on her hands."&lt;ref name="colman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/the-favourite-olivia-colman-emma-stone-yorgos-lanthimos-venice-1202454629/|title=Olivia Colman On 'The Favourite': It Was “Awfully Fun Having Sex With Emma Stone” – Venice|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Nancy|last=Tartaglione|date=30 August 2018|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weisz described the film as a comedy, comparing it to a "funnier, sex driven" ''[[All About Eve]]'' (1950), and was primarily attracted to the project due to the prominent female leads, and considered her role to be “the juiciest” of her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/06/rachel-weisz-yorgos-lanthimos-the-favourite-1201838213/|title=Rachel Weisz Says Yorgos Lanthimos' 'The Favourite' Is Like a Funnier, Sex-Driven 'All About Eve'|website=IndieWire|first=Kate|last=Erbland|date=6 June 2017|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone was initially hesitant to accept the role, at first thinking Abigail was “a sweet kind of girl, the victim, a servant to these people,” but changed her mind after reading the script, and ended up "begging" Lanthimos for the role. Stone’s greatest concern was mastering her accent: "It's 1705, which was about 300 years before any period I had ever done. It was pretty daunting on a few levels — having to be British and not stick out like a sore thumb [...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emma-stones-reveals-acting-breaking-points-1139241|title=Telluride: Emma Stone Reveals Her Acting Breaking Points|work=The Hollywood Reporter|first=Stephen|last=Galloway|date=2 September 2018|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having less dynamic roles, Hoult and Alwyn were nonetheless intrigued to be a part of a film dominated by three complex leading female characters. "It’s obviously very timely to have three female leads, and it’s wonderful to see because it’s so rare," said Hoult, "The dynamic between the characters they play is so wonderful because it’s so intricate and difficult to understand exactly who’s wanting what from this love-power struggle, and it’s just wonderful to watch and see." Alwyn shared similar views: "It’s unusual, I suppose, to have a film led by three women, and these three women are so unbelievably talented and generous as performers and also as people, and to spend time with them and be on set with them and everyone else was just a lot of fun. I was just happy to be a part of it at all. It’s rare to get a film like this to come along that is so different from what we’re used to seeing, especially with a director like this, so to be any part in it was brilliant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/scene/news/the-favourite-female-led-film-resonates-during-metoo-and-times-up-1202962340/|title=‘The Favourite’: Female-Led Film Resonates During #MeToo and Times Up|website=Variety|first=Cristina|last=Gibson|date=29 September 2018|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to filming, Lanthimos engaged the principal actors in an approximately three week rehearsal process, which included the actresses walking backwards quickly to see if they would collide with one another, and according to Weisz, another exercise which involved the actors linking their arms together to create “a human pretzel.” According to Stone, Lanthimos wanted to see “how much we could sense each other without seeing each other.” Lanthimos himself stated that the rehearsals “enabled [the actors] to not take themselves too seriously, learn the text in a physical way by doing completely irrelevant things to what the scene is about, just be comfortable about making a fool of themselves.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/features/favourite-blows-up-metoo-gender-politics-love-triangle-1160665|title='The Favourite' Blows Up Gender Politics With the Year's Most Outrageous Love Triangle|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Tatiana|last=Siegel|date=November 14, 2018|accessdate=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Hatfield House.jpg|thumb|230px|A majority of the film's principal photography took place at the [[Hatfield House]], [[Hertfordshire]].]]
Filming was expected to begin in the spring of 2016, but was pushed back a year, during which time Lanthimos directed ''[[The Killing of a Sacred Deer]]'' (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lodderhose|first1=Diana|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/cannes-colin-farrell-reunites-with-yorgos-lanthimos-for-the-killing-of-a-sacred-deer-exclusive-1201771113/|title=Cannes: Colin Farrell Reunites With Yorgos Lanthimos for 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer' (EXCLUSIVE)|date=11 May 2016|work=Variety|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Principal photography]] began in March 2017 at [[Hatfield House]], [[Hertfordshire]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theknowledgeonline.com/the-knowledge-bulletin/post/2017/01/10/emma-stone-to-film-the-favourite-in-uk-|title=Emma Stone to film The Favourite in UK|website=The Knowledge Bulletin|first=Nia|last=Daniels|date=10 January 2017|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/colin-farrell-oliver-north-amazon-show-iran-contra-1202008969/|title=Colin Farrell to Star as Oliver North in Iran-Contra Series for Amazon (EXCLUSIVE)|website=Variety|first=Justin|last=Kroll|date=20 March 2017|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded in May 2017.&lt;ref name="wrap"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/05/yorgos-lanthimos-the-favourite-plot-details-revealed-lesbian-love-triangle-1201817231/|title=Yorgos Lanthimos Wraps Period Piece 'The Favourite,' Official Synopsis Hints At Royal-Centric Lesbian Love Triangle|website=IndieWire|first=Jude|last=Dry|date=15 May 2017|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lanthimos stated that a major reason for filming at the Hatfield House was because "From the beginning, I had this image of these lonely characters in huge spaces." 

Production designer Fiona Crombie drew inspiration from the chequered black-and-white marble floor in the Great Hall for the film's colour palette, noting that "a character will walk into a room and you get this incredible wide-shot – we're talking seeing from the floors to the ceilings to the corners. You see everything." Several alterations were made to various rooms in the house, particularly for the Queen's room, which included removing paintings, furniture, and other decorations, in order to "put our own language into it." As with most of Lanthimos' works, the film implements natural lighting as opposed to artificial lighting, which proved to be somewhat challenging for the night time scenes, which were candle-lit: "as you imagine, there are very strict protocols about managing candles [...] we had to use an enormous number of wax catchers. But the people who manage Hatfield were very supportive and we negotiated and negotiated, and we would be able to do a vast majority of what we wanted to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocationguide.com/2018/09/yorgos-lanthimoss-venice-film-festival-crowd-pleaser-the-favourite-filmed-almost-exclusively-at-hatfield-house-hertfordshire/#|title=Yorgos Lanthimos's Venice Film Festival crowd pleaser The Favourite filmed almost exclusively at Hatfield House, Hertfordshire|website=The Location Guide|first=Shona|last=Smith|date=3 September 2018|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costume designer [[Sandy Powell (costume designer)|Sandy Powell]] specifically sought out Lanthimos, having been a fan of his previous work, including ''Dogtooth'' and ''[[Alps (film)|Alps]]'' (2011). In regards to Abigail, Powell wanted the character’s rise to power to be reflected in her costumes: “I wanted to give her that vulgarity of the nouveau riche, and her dresses get a little bolder and showier. There’s more pattern involved and there are black-and-white stripes [...] I wanted her to stand out from everybody else as trying too hard.” 
Although Queen Anne spends most of her time in the film in a nightgown, due to her ill nature, Powell wanted the Queen to have an iconic look, and constructed a robe made of ermine, explaining that, “This is the queen at her most queenly, in her ceremonial outfit [...] I looked at images and real things like it, and normally [this type of garment] would be solid gold, embroidered, and bejeweled, so I thought what else can I do just to give it an air of royalty? Ermine is associated with royalty, it’s usually just used as a decoration in small amounts, so I decided to just cover her in it. Because in the rest of the film I have her in a nightgown, not bothering to get dressed every day.” 

Although unintentional, Powell drew inspiration for Sarah’s contrasting “feminine” gowns and her “masculine” and “butch” recreational attire from her previous designs for [[Tilda Swinton]]’s character in ''[[Orlando (film)|Orlando]]'' (1992): "I didn’t think about it at the time, it was just subliminal. I do think there is a similarity between the two films because ''Orlando'' was the last unconventional period film I’d done, so there is a similarity." Powell stated that Lanthimos wanted the women in the film to have natural hair and faces, whereas he wanted the men to wear considerable makeup and large wigs: “Normally films are filled with men and the women are the decoration in the background, and I’ve one many of those, so it was quite nice for it to be reversed this time where the women are the center of the film and the men are the decoration in the background. Of course, they’ve got serious, important parts, but I think the frivolity of them is quite funny." Powell would deliver the costumes, see to it that they fit and that the actors had no problems, and would leave the set, per Lanthimos' request. She described his directing style:

{{quote|“He knew he wanted to be left alone with his actors and his camera. A lot of the time I wasn’t aware of how it was going to be. Even when you see the dailies, you can’t really tell until it’s all put together [...] But when it all comes together, you’re like of course it was all going to come together, he knows exactly what he’s doing. We were all part of the jigsaw and he could put all the pieces together.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/the-favourite-costumes-sandy-powell-interview/|title=How The Favourite costumes added renegade 'punk' edge to Queen Anne's court|website=Entertainment Weekly|first=Joey|last=Nolfi|date=9 November 2018|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For cinematographer Robbie Ryan, the most challenging aspect of filming was trying to capture fluid camera movement without the use of Steadicam: “We explored a lot of ways of trying to have a fluid camera movement that wasn’t a Steadicam move. He showed me a film early on called ''Angst'' [...] He wanted to try and instill that in the way we shot ''The Favourite'', but it was going to be really difficult to do that. Because of the costumes and just the physicality of it, it was not going to be possible. So we tried to come up with ways of being as fluid as we could with the camera. That was exciting because we came up with some interesting rigs—we explored different gimbal rigs and things like that.” Lanthimos heavily encouraged Ryan to implement fisheye and wide lenses for a majority of the shots, which Ryan believed significantly contributed to the story: “The wide lens is twofold. By showing you the whole room and also isolating the character in a small space—like, a small character in a big space—you get a feeling of no escape. I think one of the critiques of the film said it was like a playground that turns into a battleground that turns into a prison. I think that’s a very good explanation of what the film tries to get across with these characters. I think the wide lenses are pretty integral to that, as well.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/the-favourite-robbie-ryan-yorgos-lanthimos-cinematography-interview-1202494103/|title=‘The Favourite’ DP Robbie Ryan Brings Fisheye Lenses &amp; Fluid, Roving Camera To Yorgos Lanthimos’ Madcap Period Piece|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Matt|last=Grobar|date=6 November 2018|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
On review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 136 reviews, and an average rating of 8.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''The Favourite'' sees Yorgos Lanthimos balancing a period setting against rich, timely subtext - and getting roundly stellar performances from his well-chosen stars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_favourite_2018|title=The Favourite (2018)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=3 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gives the film a weighted average score of 92 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-favourite|title=The Favourite Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=3 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Chris Nashawaty gave an "A", praising the effective presentation of themes dealing with royalty and associated "steamier, fact adjacent subplot's ... it's worth pointing out that ''The Favourite'' is easily Lanthimos' most user-friendly movie. Which isn't to say it isn't strange enough to please his fans, just that it may also convert a legion of new ones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Review of 'The Favourite' |last=Nashawaty |first=Chris |date=November 30, 2018 |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' give the movie 5 out of 5 stars saying, "Emma Stone, Rachel Weisz and the mighty Olivia Colman turn a period piece into a caustic comeuppance comedy with fangs and claws -  It's a bawdy, brilliant triumph, directed by Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos with all the artistic reach and renegade deviltry, ''The Favourite'' belongs to its fierce, profanely funny female trio."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/olivia-colman-interview-758116 |title=Olivia Colman: All Hail 'The Favourite' Queen |last=Grierson |first=Tim |date=November 19, 2018 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''{{Lang|de|Theater an der Wien}}''' is a historic theatre in [[Vienna]] located on the Left [[Wienzeile]] in the [[Mariahilf]] district. Completed in 1801, the theatre has hosted the premieres of many celebrated works of theatre, opera, and symphonic music. Since 2006, it has served primarily as an opera house, hosting its own company.

Although "{{lang|de|Wien}}" is German for "Vienna", the "{{lang|de|Wien}}" in the name of the theatre is actually the name of the [[Wien (river)|Wien River]], which once flowed by the theatre site; "{{Lang|de|an der Wien}}" means "on the banks of the Wien". In modern times, the river has been covered over in this location and the covered riverbed now houses the [[Naschmarkt]], an open-air market.

The theatre is operated in cooperation with [[Vereinigte Bühnen Wien]] (VBW) which also operates the [[Raimund Theater]] and the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ronacher|de}}.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
[[File:TheateranDerWienJakobAlt.jpg|thumb|right|{{Lang|de|Theater an der Wien}}, 1815]]
The theatre was the brainchild of the Viennese theatrical [[impresario]] [[Emanuel Schikaneder]], who is best known as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[libretto|librettist]] and collaborator on the opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' (1791). Schikaneder's troupe had already been successfully performing for several years in Vienna in the smaller {{Lang|de|[[Theater auf der Wieden]]}} and this is where ''The Magic Flute'' had premiered. As the troupe's performances often emphasized spectacle and scenery, the librettist felt ready to move to a larger and better equipped venue.&lt;ref&gt;Braunbehrens 1990, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had already been granted an imperial licence to build a new theatre in 1786, but it was only in 1798 that he felt ready to act on this authorization. The building was designed by the architect Franz Jäger in [[Empire style]] (it has since been remodeled). Construction was completed in 1801. The theatre has been described as "the most lavishly equipped and one of the largest theatres of its age.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Branscombe]] and [[David J. Buch]], [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.rp.nla.gov.au/subscriber/article/grove/music/44709pg2 "Emanuel Schikaneder"] in ''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paul Ott TAW.jpg|thumb|upright|left|{{Lang|de|Theater an der Wien}} interior]]
The theatre opened on 13 June 1801 with a prologue written by Schikaneder followed by a performance of the opera ''Alexander'' by [[Franz Teyber]]. The new theatre proved to be a sensation. Adolf Bäurle, a local critic, wrote "if Schikaneder and [his partner] Zitterbarth had had the idea ... to charge admission simply for looking at the glories of their {{lang|de|Theater an der Wien}}, Schikaneder would certainly have been able to take in vast sums of money without giving one single performance." The ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' called it the "most comfortable and satisfactory in the whole of Germany" (which meant at the time, "all German-speaking lands").&lt;ref&gt;Honolka 1990, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1807 the theatre was acquired by a group of court nobles that included Count [[Ferdinánd Pálffy|Ferdinand Palffy von Erdöd]], who bought it outright in 1813. During the period of his proprietorship, which lasted until 1826, he offered [[opera]] and [[ballet]] and, to appeal to a wider Viennese audience, popular [[pantomime]] and variety acts, losing money in elaborate spectacles until finally he was forced to sell the theatre at auction in 1826.

Only a part of the original building is preserved: the ''{{Lang|de|Papagenotor}}'' (Papageno Gate) is a memorial to Schikaneder, who is depicted playing the role of Papageno in ''The Magic Flute'', a role he wrote for himself to perform. He is accompanied by the Three Boys, characters in the same opera.

In the late 19th to early 20th centuries, the theatre experienced a golden age during the flourishing of Viennese [[operetta]], as referenced in the list below.

=== Later history ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Wien Theater an der Wien Vorderhaus.jpg|thumb|upright|The {{Lang|de|Theater an der Wien}} during the period it emphasized Broadway musicals. The Broadway-style marquee was removed in 2005.]]

From 1945 to 1955, it was one of the temporary homes of the [[Vienna State Opera]], whose own building had been destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II. However, in 1955, the theatre was closed for safety reasons. It languished unused for several years, and by the early 1960s, the threat had emerged that it would be converted to a parking garage. (This was the same era of "urban renewal" that in America nearly destroyed [[Carnegie Hall]]).

By 1962 the theatre had a new and successful role as a venue for contemporary [[musical theatre]]. Many English-language musicals had their German premieres there. In 1992, the musical [[Elisabeth (musical)|''Elisabeth'']] (about [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]]'s wife, [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Elisabeth of Bavaria]], also known as Sissi), premiered there and ran for six consecutive years until 1998; Elisabeth went on to become the most successful German-language musical to date, returning to the Theater an der Wien for a revival production from 2003 to 2005. The musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' directed and choreographed by [[Gillian Lynne]] played successfully for seven years.

Despite its focus on operettas and musicals, the theatre still served as a venue for occasional opera productions, especially during the [[Vienna Festival]] seasons, and sometimes co-produced with the [[Vienna State Opera]]. Notable productions of the non-standard repertory include:
* [[Alban Berg]]'s ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' (1962), conducted by [[Karl Böhm]], staged by [[Otto Schenk]], designed by [[Caspar Neher]], and starring [[Evelyn Lear]]
* [[Joseph Haydn]]'s ''[[L'anima del filosofo|Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' (1967), conducted by [[Richard Bonynge]], staged by Rudolf Hartmann, and starring  [[Nicolai Gedda]] and [[Joan Sutherland]]
* [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''[[Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria]]'' (1971), conducted by [[Nikolaus Harnoncourt]], and staged by Federik Mirdita
* [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'' (1976), conducted by [[Julius Rudel]], staged by Mirdita, and starring Werner Hollweg, [[Teresa Berganza]], [[Arleen Augér]], and [[Edda Moser]]
* [[Franz Schubert]]'s ''[[Fierrabras (opera)|Fierrabras]]'' (1988), conducted by [[Claudio Abbado]], staged by [[Ruth Berghaus]], and starring [[Thomas Hampson]], [[Karita Mattila]], and [[László Polgár (bass)|László Polgár]]
* The world premiere of [[Adriana Hölszky]]'s ''Die Wände'' (1995), conducted by [[Ulf Schirmer]], and staged by [[Hans Neuenfels]]
Between 1996 and 2002, [[Riccardo Muti]] conducted new productions of the three [[da Ponte]] operas of Mozart, based on an original production by [[Giorgio Strehler]]).

=== Today ===
In 2006, the 250th anniversary year of Mozart's birth, the {{lang|de|Theater an der Wien}} presented a series of major Mozart operas, thus initiating its conversion to a full-time venue for opera and other forms of classical music under the direction of {{ill|Roland Geyer|de}}. Major musical productions since are now presented at either the [[Raimund Theater]] or the Ronacher. The first opera to be given was Mozart's ''Idomeneo'' with [[Neil Shicoff]] in the title role and [[Peter Schneider (conductor)|Peter Schneider]] conducting the new production by [[Willy Decker]]. Other members of the cast were [[Angelika Kirchschlager]], Genia Kühmeier, and [[Barbara Frittoli]].

Geyer is quoted as saying that he wishes to "present cutting edge directors and interesting productions",&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Midgette]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/arts/music/26midg.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0 "In Mozart's Backyard, A Fraught Rebirth of an Opera House"], ''The New York Times'', 26 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and his three main areas of focus are on [[Baroque opera]], contemporary opera, and [[Mozart]].

In recent years, the theatre's seasons have included the following works outside the standard repertoire:

The {{lang|de|Theater an der Wien}} has seen the premieres of many works by celebrated composers and playwrights.

{{Literature}}
'''Tragicomedy''' is a [[literary genre]] that blends aspects of both [[tragedy|tragic]] and [[comedy|comic]] forms. Most often seen in [[drama|dramatic literature]], the term can variously describe by either a tragic play which contains enough comic elements to lighten the overall mood or a serious play with a happy ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dewar-Watson|first1=Sarah|author2=Eds. Subha Mukherji and Raphael Lyne|title=''"Aristotle and Tragicomedy."'' Early Modern Tragicomedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gbzzzpd6oCUC|accessdate=26 January 2012|year=2007|publisher=Brewer|isbn=978-1-84384-130-2|pages=15–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In theatre ==
===Classical precedent===
[[Image:Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Tragic Comic masks of [[Ancient Greek theatre]] represented in the [[Hadrian's Villa]] mosaic.]]

There is no complete formal definition of tragicomedy from the [[classical antiquity|classical]] age.  It appears that the Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] had something like the Renaissance meaning of the term (that is, a serious action with a happy ending) in mind when, in ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', he discusses tragedy with a dual ending.&lt;ref&gt;Poetics: XIII, End of 2nd paragraph, Trans: Bywater, Ingram, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;  In this respect, a number of [[Ancient Greek theatre|Greek]] and [[theatre of ancient Rome|Roman plays]], for instance ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', may be called tragicomedies, though without any definite attributes outside of plot.  The word itself originates with the Roman comic playwright [[Plautus]], who coined the term somewhat facetiously in the prologue to his play ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]''.  The character Mercury, sensing the indecorum of the inclusion of both kings and gods alongside servants in a comedy, declares that the play had better be a "tragicomoedia":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Verna A.|title=The Name and Nature of Tragicomedy|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot, UK|isbn=0-7546-3567-8|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|I will make it a mixture: let it be a tragicomedy. I don't think it would be appropriate to make it consistently a comedy, when there are kings and gods in it. What do you think? Since a slave also has a part in the play, I'll make it a tragicomedy...{{emdash}}{{small|[[Plautus]], ''[[Amphitryon]]''}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Plautus|others=Eds. Subha Mukherji and Raphael Lyne|title=''"Amphitryon."

===Renaissance revivals===
====Italy====
Plautus's comment had an arguably excessive impact on [[Renaissance]] aesthetic theory, which had largely transformed Aristotle's comments on drama into a rigid theory.  For "rule mongers" (the term is [[Giordano Bruno]]'s), "mixed" works such as those mentioned above, more recent "romances" such as ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', and even ''[[The Odyssey]]'' were at best puzzles; at worst, mistakes.  Two figures helped to elevate tragicomedy to the status of a regular genre, by which is meant one with its own set of rigid rules. [[Giovanni Battista Giraldi]] Cinthio, in the mid-sixteenth century, both argued that the tragedy-with-comic-ending (''tragedia de lieto fin'') was most appropriate to modern times and produced his own examples of such plays.  Even more important was [[Giovanni Battista Guarini]].  Guarini's ''[[Il Pastor Fido]]'', published in 1590, provoked a fierce critical debate in which Guarini's spirited defense of generic innovation eventually carried the day.  Guarini's tragicomedy offered modulated action that never drifted too far either to comedy or tragedy, mannered characters, and a pastoral setting.  All three became staples of continental tragicomedy for a century and more.

====England====
In England, where practice ran ahead of theory, the situation was quite different.  In the sixteenth century, "tragicomedy" meant the native sort of romantic play that violated the unities of time, place, and action, that glibly mixed high- and low-born characters, and that presented fantastic actions.  These were the features [[Philip Sidney]] deplored in his complaint against the "mungrell Tragy-comedie" of the 1580s, and of which Shakespeare's Polonius offers famous testimony: "The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individuable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men." Some aspects of this romantic impulse remain even in the work of more sophisticated playwrights: [[Shakespeare]]'s last plays, which may well be called tragicomedies, have often been called romances.

By the early Stuart period, some English playwrights had absorbed the lessons of the Guarini controversy. [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s ''The Faithful Shepherdess'', an adaptation of Guarini's play, was produced in 1608.  In the printed edition, Fletcher offered an interesting definition of the term, worth quoting at length: "A tragi-comedie is not so called in respect of mirth and killing, but in respect it wants deaths, which is enough to make it no tragedy, yet brings some neere it, which is inough to make it no comedie."  Fletcher's definition focuses primarily on events: a play's genre is determined by whether or not people die in it, and in a secondary way on how close the action comes to a death.  But, as Eugene Waith showed, the tragicomedy Fletcher developed in the next decade also had unifying stylistic features: sudden and unexpected revelations, outré plots, distant locales, and a persistent focus on elaborate, artificial rhetoric.

Some of Fletcher's contemporaries, notably [[Philip Massinger]] and [[James Shirley]], wrote successful and popular tragicomedies. [[Richard Brome]] also essayed the form, but with less success. And many of their contemporary writers, ranging from [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]] to [[Lodowick Carlell]] to Sir [[Aston Cockayne]], made attempts in the genre.

Tragicomedy remained fairly popular up to the closing of the theaters in 1642, and Fletcher's works were popular in the Restoration as well.  The old styles were cast aside as tastes changed in the eighteenth century; the "tragedy with a happy ending" eventually developed into [[melodrama]], in which form it still flourishes.

====Later developments====
The more subtle criticism that developed after the Renaissance stressed the thematic and formal aspects of tragicomedy, rather than plot. [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] defined it as a mixture of emotions in which "seriousness stimulates laughter, and pain pleasure."  Even more commonly, tragicomedy's affinity with satire and "dark" comedy have suggested a tragicomic impulse in modern theatre with Luigi Pirandello who influenced Beckett.  Also it can be seen in [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist]] drama. [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], the Swiss dramatist, suggested that tragicomedy was the inevitable genre for the twentieth century; he describes his play ''[[The Visit (play)|The Visit]]'' (1956) as a tragicomedy.  Tragicomedy is a common genre in post-[[World War II]] [[United Kingdom|British]] theatre, with authors as varied as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Tom Stoppard]], [[John Arden]], [[Alan Ayckbourn]] and [[Harold Pinter]] writing in this genre. Many writers of the [[Metamodernism|metamodernist]] and [[postmodernist]] movements have made use of tragicomedy and/or [[gallows humor]]. A notable example of a [[Metamodernism|metamodernist]] tragicomedy is [[David Foster Wallace]]'s 1996 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''[[Infinite Jest]]''.

'''United Art Rating''' is a reference book published since 1999 by [[Artists Trade Union of Russia]] as one of the instruments of art market regulations.&lt;ref&gt;"Чтобы как-то стабилизировать ценообразование на арт-рынке, Профессиональный союз художников с 1999 года издает "Единый художественный рейтинг". В него входят имена, даты жизни и рейтинговые категории почти 40 тыс. художников Российской империи, СССР, русского зарубежья, Российской Федерации и республик бывшего Советского Союза. Живые и ушедшие — вперемешку. "Делить художников по принципу "жив или мертв" неправильно: с точки зрения ценообразования смерть мастера не самый значительный фактор",— рассказывает Сергей Заграевский. Тем не менее высшую часть пирамиды рейтинга формируют великие мастера прошлого. Основание пирамиды — растущие молодые художники или инертная масса работников изобразительного цеха, которые не участвуют в бурной выставочной жизни. Эксперты, занимающиеся составлением рейтинга, отслеживают динамику роста или деградации тех и других. Живопись — это не теннис, и здесь, конечно, трудно быть уверенным, кто кого обыграет… И все же справочник во многом — зеркало ценообразования: середнячки редко бывают богаты". ([http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1028246 Ксения Гулиа. Картинная лотерея. Журнал «Деньги», № 37(692) от 22.09.2008])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Проект «Арт—рейтинг» может помочь «войти» и в современное искусство, и в сложный процесс арт—рынка. В Арт—рейтинге — в Едином художественном рейтинге Профессионального союза художников — сделана некая попытка классификации: расположить художников по уровню реализации их дарования с учетом, конечно, участия в престижных выставках, внимания к ним средств массовой информации, искусствоведов, музейных работников, членства в союзах, творческих объединениях и прочее... Подобная попытка поставить художников в ряд «по росту» может показаться безнадежной. Но она удалась. Поставленная задача решена, правда, без особых претензий на полную строгость и объективность, что и хорошо".([http://www.artcitiez.com/index.php?id=813 Журнал «Арт Город», № 1 (24), 2010])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Оценивая современную живопись, из-за отсутствия аукционов галеристы и покупатели руководствуются художественным рейтингом. Рейтинг в данном случае понимается как попытка со стороны экспертов стратифицировать творчество художников. Наиболее полным на сегодняшний день рейтингом как украинских, так и российских художников является «Единый художественный рейтинг»".

== About ==
United Art Rating (before 2012, referred to as United Artists Rating) is a rating published as a periodical reference book, registered as [[mass media]]. As of 2016, it has stood 22 printed editions, total number of printed copies is more than 90000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artunion.ru/rating/archive_engl.htm Archive of United Art Rating editions]&lt;/ref&gt; The electronic version is also available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rating.artunion.ru/electronic_engl.htm United Art Rating. The electronic version]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 2016, United Art Rating included the names, dates of life and rating categories of 58965 artists (painters, graphic and poster artists, theatre decorators, batik painters, illustrators, animators, sculptors, jewelers, ceramists, authors of installations etc.).

Editor-in-chief: [[Sergey Zagraevsky]], chairman of Artists Trade Union of Russia, member of [[Russian Academy of Arts]] and Russian Academy of Art-critics, Honored culture worker of Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zagraevsky.com Dr. Sergey Zagraevsky. Official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, United Art Rating was awarded the gratitude of the Minister of culture of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rating.artunion.ru/feedback.htm United Art Rating. Feedback (in Russian).]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles of rating ==
The Rating Centre acts under Artists Trade Union of Russia and has a status of an independent professional jury, free in its judges and estimations. Defining rating categories is made on the basis of all available information about works of art, biographies, expositions, collections and sales of works, catalogues and Internet and press publications, art historians' and art-managers' opinions, public opinion polls etc.

United Art Rating consists of 2 sections:
*Russian Art Rating (Rating of artists of Russian Empire, the USSR, Russian emigration, Russian Federation and the republics of the former Soviet Union);
*International Artists Rating (All-world Rating of artists of 18th–21st centuries, forming the world art heritage).

Artists are subdivided into categories "A" and "B": an artist of "A" category does not virtually submit to the market's demand. an artist of "B" category is mainly oriented to the market demand.

Each category has its levels from the first (the top of recognition and fame; is referred to the deceased classic artists, whose works of art are widely recognized in museums) to the seventh one (amateur artist).

According to the declared principles, defining of rating categories is made on available information about expositions, sales and collections of works, catalogues, publications, biographies, public-opinion polls etc. Rating criteria are: art level of works, their humanistic significance, professionalism, exhibitions, works in museums, recognition by the public, galleries and art critics, social and civil significance of works, price level of works etc.

United Art Rating contains pricing recommendations about sale and purchase of works of art.

United Art Rating is constantly changed, refined and supplemented.

== Description of rating categories ==
*1 – an artist of world fame, tested with time (for no less than a century).
*1A – a world-famous artist.
*1B – a high-class professional artist with remarkable organizational skills, who is popular and in demand.
*2A – a high-class professional artist with a bright creative individuality.
*2B – a high-class professional artist, recognized and in demand with the art-market and public.
*3A – a professional artist with a recognizable individual style.
*3B – a professional artist, recognized and asked for in the art market and by the public.
*4A – an established professional artist with creative potential.
*4B – an established professional artist, who is in demand in the art market.
*5A – a formed professional artist with creative potential.
*5B – a formed professional artist.
*6A – a forming professional artist with creative potential.
*6B – a forming professional artist.
*7 – an amateur artist with perspective evaluation of specialists.
*8 – an amateur artist.
*9 – an artist-beginner.
*10 – an artist-apprentice.

== International Art Rating ==
International Art Rating includes the first three categories of United Art Rating (i.e. 1, 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A and 3B). These artists formed and are forming the history of world art of 18th–21st centuries.

International Art Rating includes artists of [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]] and former Soviet republics, the republics of the former [[Yugoslavia]], [[United States]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Sweden]], [[Japan]] and some other countries, such as [[Namibia]].

'''Vasyl Vasyltsiv''' ({{lang-uk|Васи́ль Васи́льців}}; born June 26, 1987) is an [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] singer and composer.

Vasyl Vasyltsiv was born on June 26, 1987 in [[Lviv]]. In spite of his young age, since writing his first song in 2001 Vasyltsiv has released nine albums (as of May 2008). Though only one of them came under official label (''Goldenhits'') Vasyltsiv is sometimes considered as "the face of Ukrainian underground" and "genius of pure simplicity".&lt;ref name="uaf"&gt;[http://uaformat.com/content/view/1383/39/ Український Формат - Крихітка Цахес на прізвисько Василь Васильців, або Перший столичний виступ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Whitney Dean''' (also '''Carter''') is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Shona McGarty]]. The character is the [[ward (law)|ward]] of long-running character [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]), and was introduced on 1 April 2008 when Palmer returned to the series after a six-year absence. Whitney is described by executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] as both an equal to, and younger version of Bianca, and is the oldest of Bianca's four children. Her storylines have revolved around her fractured family life, her [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]] by Bianca's partner [[Tony King (EastEnders)|Tony King]] ([[Chris Coghill]]), her [[sexual exploitation]] by [[Rob Grayson]] ([[Jody Latham]]), her marriage to [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]) and [[miscarriage|miscarrying]] his baby, surviving a bus crash, falling in love with her father-in-law [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]) and becoming engaged to [[Woody Woodward (EastEnders)|Woody Woodward]] ([[Lee Ryan]]). McGarty was temporarily written out of ''EastEnders'' for four weeks in July 2012 because of her repeated lateness to work.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a393398/shona-mcgarty-suspended-from-eastenders-for-persistent-lateness.html&lt;/ref&gt; McGarty took an extended break from the show in 2017, with Whitney departing on 29 May. She returned on 31 July.

==Storylines==
Whitney first appears when she and her family — guardian [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) and siblings [[Tiffany Dean]] ([[Maisie Smith]]), [[Liam Butcher]] (James Forde) and [[Morgan Jackson-King]] (Devon Higgs) — are evicted by their landlord. The children spend a week in care after Bianca is arrested for assaulting a police officer, returning to her custody a week later and moving into [[Pat Evans (EastEnders)|Pat Evans]]' ([[Pam St. Clement]]) house. Over the next few months, Bianca becomes the beneficiary of a mystery "guardian angel", who is revealed to be Whitney. Whitney tells Bianca she found a winning lottery ticket, but kept it secret as she knew that Bianca would spend the money. Bianca reluctantly agrees to deposit the money; however Whitney hides some to be used in emergencies. It is revealed that Bianca's imprisoned boyfriend [[Tony King (EastEnders)|Tony King]] ([[Chris Coghill]]) has been grooming Whitney since she was 12 and that they have had a sexual relationship. Having served a year-long prison sentence for assaulting a boy who apparently harassed Whitney, Tony is released in September 2008. He makes it clear to Whitney that they will resume their sexual relationship, and Whitney reveals that she has kept some of the lottery winnings so they can run away together. When Bianca harangues him about the prospect of marriage, he gives her Whitney's money to put a down-payment on a flat. When Whitney and classmate [[Peter Beale]] ([[Thomas Law]]) are cast in a school play, Tony is jealous of them rehearsing in private and punches Peter. Whitney convinces Peter and his sister [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Melissa Suffield]]) not to report the attack to the police, but Tony blames her for the incident and ends their affair. Devastated when Tony accepts Bianca's marriage proposal, Whitney locks herself in her bedroom. Not knowing what to do, Bianca accepts Dr [[Poppy Merritt]]'s (Amy Darcy) help and she refers Whitney to a psychiatrist. Bianca takes her away on holiday, attempting to mend their relationship. When they return, Tony and Whitney share a passionate kiss, and Tony informs Whitney that their relationship is back on.

Whitney becomes jealous when Tony begins showing an interest in Bianca's cousin, [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Madeline Duggan]]). As her sixteenth birthday approaches, she buys tickets for them to travel abroad. Tony loses interest in Whitney and hides her passport, but it is found and returned to her. On the day she turns sixteen, Whitney confesses everything to Bianca. Horrified, Bianca calls the police, and Tony is arrested. He is released on bail but Whitney decides to make a statement to the police. Whitney contacts her biological mother [[Debra Dean (EastEnders)|Debra Dean]] ([[Ruth Gemmell]]) and tries to discuss the past, but Debra is not interested and rejects her. She meets [[Todd Taylor (EastEnders)|Todd Taylor]] ([[Ashley Kumar]]) and agrees to go on a date with him, which goes well until he asks about past relationships. Whitney runs away and Bianca's ex-husband [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) finds her drunk.  Todd returns and Whitney agrees to another date. When Whitney finds a condom in his wallet, she assumes he wants to have sex with her and runs away.

Debra turns up unexpectedly, claiming she is homeless, but reveals she is planning to move to [[Greece]] when she has enough money and says Whitney can come with her. Whitney accepts, but later realises that Debra is using her and she is only there to hide from someone. Debra later tells Whitney she has a half-brother, [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a163021/eastenders-mystery-man-finally-revealed.html|title='EastEnders' mystery man finally revealed|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=10 July 2009|accessdate=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitney then takes back her statement against Tony but after Whitney's barrister sees her mobile phone containing the messages from Tony, he is sentenced to 13 years' imprisonment. During the trial Whitney learns that Tiffany is Ricky's daughter. She is initially distressed, but accepts that Tiffany is still her sister although they are not related. She repairs her friendship with Todd, and they kiss at Ricky and Bianca's engagement party. Their reunion is short-lived, and Whitney breaks up with him in favour of Bianca's half-brother [[Billie Jackson]] ([[Devon Anderson]]). Whitney is attacked by Billie's jealous friend [[List of EastEnders characters (2010)#Kylie|Kylie]] ([[Elarica Gallacher]]), and when his friends cause trouble at a [[grime (music)|grime]] night at [[The Queen Victoria]] pub (The Vic), Whitney asks him to choose between her and his former gang. Billie chooses Whitney, and Kylie takes revenge by attempting to shoot him, shooting his uncle [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) instead. Jack is hospitalised with major injuries, and Whitney struggles to help Billie deal with his guilt and subsequent anger and rejection from the Branning and Jackson families. She is further deeply upset when Billie decides to join the army in an attempt to make Jack proud. At Billie's birthday party, Whitney ends up kissing Peter. She spends the night with him and the next day is upset to learn that Billie has died in his sleep. She blames herself for leaving the party after she sees a text message from Billie saying he still loved her. She sends a reply and lays flowers and candles for him. However, she later goes back to Peter for comfort, and he comforts her again on the day of the funeral. The pair then begin a relationship. However Billie's friend [[Connor Stanley]] ([[Arinze Kene]]), starts flirting with her, and asks her why she'd date someone like Peter after dating Billie. He also asks her to sell some stolen jewellery for him and she agrees.

Whitney falls for Connor, but after it is revealed that Connor has been in a sexual relationship with Bianca's mother [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) and Whitney, Bianca attacks him and turns herself in to the police. Whitney and Carol argue over Connor, and Whitney feels she is not wanted by her family so decides to move out, and stays with Ryan's estranged wife [[Janine Malloy]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]). [[Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) offers Whitney a work trial at The Vic for a job, but catches her giving free drinks to Janine. Despite this, she lets Whitney off, telling her she is a natural, and works well at the till. When Kat catches her stealing again, she sacks Whitney, leaving Janine angry with Whitney. After Whitney sees Janine successfully pickpocket someone, she decides to try it herself, but ends up being hit in the face. A man called [[Rob Grayson]] ([[Jody Latham]]) helps her, buys her food and returns her to Albert Square, giving her his phone number. Whitney tries to kiss Max, causing her to fall out with Lauren. She also argues with Carol, rejects Ricky and is rejected by Liam, Tiffany and Morgan for ruining Ricky's birthday cake days earlier. Upset, Whitney contacts Rob and asks to stay with him, which he accepts. She throws her phone away and tells nobody that she is going. Janine lies about Whitney's whereabouts but when she admits she does not know where Whitney is, Lauren (now played by [[Jacqueline Jossa]]) and Janine attempt to find her, and Lauren sees her in Dartford going into a club. Lauren goes back with her to her bedsit, but Whitney does not want to go, saying she and Rob are in love. Lauren is then thrown out by Rob. Whitney has sex with a man called [[List of EastEnders characters (2011)#Chris|Chris]] (Richard Simons) and it is revealed that Whitney has been having sex with Rob's friends to pay off his debts to them. Janine tries to get Whitney to come home but she refuses, and Rob ejects Janine. Rob then drags Whitney out of the house and into his car, while Janine and Lauren see them driving off. They go to a house where Whitney meets another woman [[List of EastEnders characters (2011)#Chloe|Chloe]] ([[Georgia Henshaw]]) who is being exploited. Whitney tells Rob she wants to leave, but he says to either be nice to his friends or he will hurt her. He locks her in a room so she breaks the window and escapes, stopping a car and asking for help, while Rob shouts after her.

The following month, she sends Lauren a message and meets her outside the police station, looking rough, as she has been arrested for shoplifting. Whitney opts to live with [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) instead of her close family, but Dot convinces her to move back to Ricky's. When Ryan returns from a holiday, he learns of Whitney's ordeal and urges her to go to the police and get tested for sexually transmitted infections. She says she is not ready to go to the police but agrees to the test, which shows she has a [[chlamydia infection]]. When Whitney starts a relationship with a man named [[List of EastEnders characters (2011)#Lee|Lee]] (Mitchell Hunt), it is revealed that he is a friend of Rob's, and when Whitney agrees to meet Lee by text, Rob takes control of Lee's mobile phone. She allows Rob to take her home but then tells him to wait outside while she escapes through the back door and hitches a lift to [[Southend-on-Sea]] with friends. She leaves him a voicemail message not knowing that he has followed her. He finds her in her hotel room and tells her how much he loves her, but when [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) comes in, Rob attacks him, so Whitney tells him to leave. Fatboy calls Ryan, who comes to Southend to look for Rob. When he finds him, they fight and fall over the edge of the pier. The next day, a body is recovered from the sea, and is later revealed to be Rob who has died. Whitney thinks Ryan may also be dead until he appears. She tells him she has told the police everything about Rob, including Ryan's fight with him, and Ryan tells Whitney he has to leave. They say an emotional farewell.

Whitney takes an interest in [[Tyler Moon]] (Tony Discipline) but refuses to date him. Whitney applies for a new work experience at the local nursery which she later gets. When [[Michael Moon (EastEnders)|Michael Moon]] ([[Steve John Shepherd]]) tells his brother Tyler about Whitney's recent ordeal, he rejects her but later gives her his special Moon pendant to make up for it. Whitney agrees to go on a date with Tyler and they agree to have sex but Whitney is unsure as she remembers her past and runs out, telling Tyler she never wants to see him again. Tyler is hurt. He later tells Fatboy she needs a shrink which Whitney overhears. She runs out and kisses Fatboy and starts a relationship with him. Fatboy publicly declares his love for Whitney, but when he is unable to give her a driving lesson, Lucy (now [[Hetti Bywater]]) suggests that Tyler do it, because she knows that Tyler likes Whitney. Whitney starts to feel smothered by Fatboy's affections. Lucy teases Tyler by telling him that Fatboy plans to publicly propose to Whitney, so Tyler tells Whitney he likes her but Whitney says it is too late. Tyler then surprises Whitney by kissing her. Whitney, feeling guilty, refuses to go on holiday with Fatboy, and tells him to kiss her. He does, but she says it is like kissing her best friend. She then admits she wants Tyler, and Fatboy is heartbroken. Whitney then goes to see Tyler but finds him with Lucy, kissing. She then tells Tyler to leave her alone. However, Tyler later tells Whitney that he cannot, as he loves her. Whitney admits to feeling the same way, and they begin a relationship.

Whitney believes she is pregnant, and when she tells Tyler, he seems reluctant to take on a child. However he comes round to the idea, but Whitney discovers she is not pregnant after all. Bianca is caught stealing money and returns to prison, but this time located in Suffolk. The rest of Whitney's family move to Suffolk to be near her, but Whitney stays and looks after the house, along with Bianca's uncle [[Derek Branning]] ([[Jamie Foreman]]). Soon after, Tyler moves in. Whitney is angry when [[Joey Branning]] ([[David Witts]]) kisses her. Several months later, after Bianca and the rest of the family move back, Whitney and Tyler plan to get their own home. Whitney tells Tyler about the kiss with Joey, so he breaks up with her. However, he regrets it and proposes to Whitney; she accepts. Bianca disapproves when she finds out. When Lauren kisses Tyler to make her ex-boyfriend Joey jealous, Whitney ends her friendship with Lauren. After several weeks Lauren and Whitney make up. She receives a letter from a stranger, which the letter is from Tony, asking Whitney to come and see him in prison. Whitney then goes to the prison to visit Tony but is told that he has committed suicide. Trying to come to terms from Tony's death, she goes out for lunch with Tyler at ''Scarlett's'', but they later argue which leads to Whitney ending their engagement and storming out. She then goes for a drink at R&amp;R and Joey tries to comfort her which leads them to start flirting with one another. They then share a kiss and go back to Joey's house to have sex. She tells Tyler, and they both realise that they will not work out, and Tyler leaves Walford.

Whitney gets a job as a teaching assistant at Walford Primary School. During one breaktime, she warns [[Dennis Rickman Jnr]] (Harry Hickles) not to run in the playground. He ignores her and falls over, grazing his arm. Whitney does not react in the professional manner she is supposed to, causing Dennis's injury to be ignored. When Dennis's mother, [[Sharon Rickman]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) questions Dennis about his injury, he lies that Whitney assaulted him. Sharon complains and Whitney is suspended, but appeals for her job and is allowed to keep it. Whitney later sets her sights on newcomer [[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny Carter]] ([[Sam Strike]]), unaware that he is gay. Johnny's parents, [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]) and [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]), hope that Johnny and Whitney will become an item, but his sister [[Nancy Carter]] ([[Maddy Hill]]) reveals to them that he is gay. A few weeks later, Johnny comes out to Whitney, which hurts her as she feels that Johnny has been using her. They later become good friends and Whitney forgives Johnny.

When Johnny's elder brother [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]) returns from serving in Afghanistan, Whitney takes an instant liking to him and they share a kiss. She discovers that Lee had sex with Lucy, which upsets her greatly and she spams Lucy's Facebook page with horrible comments. The next day, Lucy is found dead. At her funeral, [[Tamwar Masood]] ([[Himesh Patel]]) discovers a condolences card with "Rot in Hell" written on it, and realises the handwriting matches Whitney's. When he confronts her, she tells him that Lucy was sending her abusive texts about her looks, and that she completely despised her. Feeling sorry for Whitney, Tamwar rips up the card, but it is later recovered by his suspicious sister, [[Shabnam Masood]] ([[Rakhee Thakrar]]).

Upon Lee's return from the army, Whitney gives the relationship another chance. She struggles with the prospect of making their romance sexual, but eventually agrees to when he talks about his feelings for her. Ryan's young daughter [[Lily Branning]] (Aine Garvey) comes to live in Walford when her mother [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) is sent to prison, and Whitney babysits her. She puts a photo of herself and Lily online and is shocked when Ryan contacts her under the alias of 'Simon Parker'. After speaking with Johnny and Lee, she decides to reply. Stacey is granted her appeal and freed but Whitney worries it will ruin her relationship with Lily. Whitney tells Lily about Ryan saying she could possibly meet him. When Stacey finds out, she argues with Whitney and says she will not be seeing Lily again. Whitney then messages Ryan saying she needs to see him urgently. Whitney then arranges to meet Ryan at the park. Stacey and Lily visit the park whilst Whitney is waiting for Ryan. Stacey apologises to Whitney and she accepts. Whitney thinks Ryan has stood her up, so leaves with Stacey and Lily. Ryan turns up late and hides on seeing Stacey, and remains unseen as a result.

Bianca tells Whitney she is moving to [[Milton Keynes]] with her partner [[Terry Spraggan]] ([[Terry Alderton]]), and wants her to move with them and the children. Although originally agreeing, Lee persuades her to stay and she moves into the pub with the Carters. Lee develops depression, and when Whitney finds out, she struggles to support him at his lowest points. At Mick's stag party before his wedding to Linda, Lee knocks himself unconscious and is carried upstairs by Mick and Whitney. Whitney confesses to Mick that she intends to break up with Lee after the wedding, unable to handle his depression. However, she is unaware that Lee has overheard her via the baby monitor. On the day of the wedding, Lee goes missing and Whitney and Mick find him drunk at the park. Lee tells Whitney that he blames himself for her wanting to break up with him, and she promises him that they will work things out. Whitney later thanks Mick for helping her with Lee, but accidentally kisses him on the lips in the process. While Mick and Linda are on their honeymoon, Whitney invites Ryan back to Walford to see Lily, but while at the pub, he steals the cash from the safe, causing Whitney and Nancy to fight, just as Mick and Linda walk in on them. The next morning, Whitney contacts Ryan and he asks to meet in the park. Mick accompanies Whitney and assures a scared Ryan that he can trust him. It then emerges that Whitney told Mick that Ryan killed Rob, so Whitney and Mick convince Ryan to return the money and hand himself to the police, and Whitney will back him up in the hope of him being charged with manslaughter instead of murder, to which Ryan agrees. Whitney shares an emotional goodbye with Ryan as he heads into the police station. On the ride home from the police station, an upset Whitney tells Mick that she has feelings for him and kisses him again. Mick tells Linda what happened, so Linda tells her to stay away from Mick and not to give up on Lee. Whitney later visits Ryan in prison, stating that she is worried about Lee. When she accidentally says Mick's name, he guesses that she has feelings for Mick, which she denies. He then urges Whitney to help Lee, so she gets him a job interview at a local pub, however this causes major grievances between Lee and Nancy. Whitney is forced by Babe to tell Lee about her kissing Mick, and although Nancy tells her to move out, Lee's response is to propose marriage.

Whitney discovers she is pregnant by Lee, but all her hints and attempts to tell him fail. Linda realises and is ecstatic when Whitney confirms it. Linda tells Mick, and when Whitney tells Lee, Mick and Linda rush into the room to celebrate before he has a chance to let the news sink in. Whitney and Lee are both diagnosed with chlamydia and Whitney blames herself due to Rob. Abi admits to Whitney she had a one-night stand and gave Lee chlamydia. Whitney initially ends their relationship and considers leaving Walford, but later decides to give him another chance. Whitney is pleased when Ryan is released from prison and he tells her he is moving to Wakefield. He offers Whitney and Lee to move in with him and she accepts, but later declines when Linda strongly disapproves of them moving so far away. Whitney and Ryan share an emotional farewell. Whitney suffers [[metrorrhagia|spotting]] and is taken to hospital with Lee, Linda and Mick, where the bleeding gets heavier. A scan shows Whitney has miscarried her baby, devastating her and Lee. Lauren encourages Whitney to find out whether she lost their baby due to him giving her chlamydia and she confides in Johnny (now [[Ted Reilly]]) that chlamydia might have caused it but tells Lee that the doctors said it could not have. Whitney decides to go Milton Keynes to stay with Bianca but returns the next day with Bianca's wedding dress and intends to get married. She reassures everyone she is fine and is thrown another hen party. Whitney marries Lee with Stacey acting as maid of honour in place of an ill Lauren and Tiffany and Lily as bridesmaids. Whitney is disappointed to learn that Lee was behind the robbery at The Vic but is unaware how close to suicide he was. She argues with Lee over money and [[Danny Mitchell (EastEnders)|Danny Mitchell]] ([[Liam Bergin]]) who tries to kiss her. Whitney then turns to Mick for support, and sleeps at The Vic. The next day she is reconciled with an apologetic Lee but finds his wage slip showing how little he earns. Following another argument with Lee, Whitney confides in Mick, telling him she is going to buy Ryan an engagement present. Later, a bus crashes into the market and Whitney is trapped underneath it. Whitney is rescued and in hospital, she talks to Mick about her marriage. He comforts her and she kisses him, which is seen by [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]). Whitney decides to organise a night out and pawns her wedding ring for cash. Lee discovers what she has done and they start arguing. When Whitney says he doesn't deserve her, Lee slaps her in the face. Shortly after the incident Whitney lays on the bed in silence, with Lee begging for forgiveness. Whitney confides in Lauren who strongly advises her to leave Lee.

Whitney decides to give Lee another chance on the condition that he will never assault her again, therefore he should seek anger management therapy. Lee gratefully accepts for the sake of their marriage. However, on Valentine's Day, Lee leaves Whitney, leaving a handwritten note on their bed saying he no longer loves her. He returns the following day, apologising to Whitney for his actions and tells her of his plans to move to [[Dover]]. An upset Whitney, realising that Lee plans to leave on his own to figure himself out, tells him to leave and she watches him from the window as he drives off. Whitney becomes closer to Mick in Linda's absence and is warned by Shirley to stay away from him. When Mick leaves to look after Nancy when she is hit by a car Whitney is left in charge of running the pub. She later steals [[Vincent Hubbard]]'s ([[Richard Blackwood]]) credit card to pay for a dog pen for [[Lady Di (EastEnders)|Lady Di]] (Hot Lips), as the Carters cannot afford it due to their debts. Whitney later grows close to new bar manager [[Woody Woodward (EastEnders)|Woody Woodward]] ([[Lee Ryan]]). Lee attempts to call Whitney but Woody tells Lee that she does not want to speak to him, so Lee sends his friend [[List of EastEnders characters (2016)#Moose|Moose]] (Sam Gittins) to see her, who says that Lee wants a divorce. Whitney receives a letter from Lee's solicitor, citing her unreasonable behaviour as grounds for the divorce, but Woody tells her it is not a big deal. Whitney declares that she is going to move on with her life and goes out shopping, but Woody sees she has not taken her purse and goes to give it to her. Whitney is caught shoplifting by a security guard, who offers her sex in exchange for not calling the police. Woody arrives and punches the guard, and takes Whitney home. Whitney and Woody kiss and have sex, and then a returning Mick finds them in bed together. Mick finds more items that Whitney has shoplifted, and she says she should never have married Lee as she is damaged and only good for sex but he tells her she is wrong and promises not to leave again. Mick lashes out at Whitney after learning that Linda and Shirley sold the freehold of The Queen Vic without his knowledge to pay for an operation for Lady Di. A few days later, Whitney is depressed and vulnerable and, when Mick kisses her, she responds. When Shirley finds out about the kiss, she orders Whitney to get out, telling her that Mick would never choose her over Linda. Devastated, Whitney leaves Walford.

Whitney returns two months later. She moves back into The Queen Vic and takes back her barmaid job. Whitney reveals that she is engaged to Woody and asks Mick to give her away at their wedding. Mick struggles with Woody's presence, but agrees to get on with him for Whitney's sake and Whitney admits to Mick that although she cannot be with him, she loves him. Linda throws her out after she realises that she is the person Mick kissed and Whitney moves in with Stacey, her husband and Bianca's cousin, [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]), and their children. Mick offers her £200 in lieu of lost wages but she tells him to keep his dirty money, annoyed with him revealing everything. When Woody is offered a job in Spain as a bar manager, he asks Whitney to come with him and she accepts. However, at the last minute, Whitney discovers a note outside the tube station from Woody saying that she is better to remain in Walford. Heartbroken, Whitney visits Bianca but then returns to Walford and then moves in with Stacey. Whitney plans to move to [[Wakefield]] to restart her t-shirt business due to being fired from The Vic and the lack of opportunity in Walford. However, Tiffany returns so Whitney cancels her plans.. Tiffany arranges a date between Whitney and [[Halfway (EastEnders)|Halfway]] (Tony Clay) but Whitney leaves the date after being put off by his behaviour. On Valentine's Day, Whitney rejects Halfway's surprise but she is touched when Halfway talks about how his grandfather brought him up to treat women with respect. Whitney apologises for her attitude, but Halfway has to leave for the Army. They then continue to stay in touch via video chat.

==Creation==
In October 2007, it was announced that the character Bianca Jackson was returning to ''EastEnders'' after an absence of six years. Whitney was created as part of her new family; the daughter of Bianca's deceased partner Nathan Dean. She was described as "a teenage drama queen, unable to engage brain before mouth and constantly finding herself in and out of trouble".&lt;ref name="kids"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a91777/in-pictures-meet-enders-jackson-five.html|title=In pictures: Meet Enders' Jackson Five|first=Kris|last=Green|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|date=18 March 2008|accessdate=18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bianca sees Whitney as one of her own, and also as "a friend and confidante".&lt;ref name="kids"/&gt; ''EastEnders''' executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] said that his vision for the character was someone "quite spiky, quite [[wikt:gobby|gobby]], a bit of an equal to Bianca, and in a way a version of Bianca at that age".&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/13/eastenders.television|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|title=Dark days in Albert Square|first=Aida|last=Edemariam|date=13 September 2008|accessdate=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shona McGarty was cast in the role.

Considering the character's role in the wider context of the show as a whole, it was decided that Whitney would be involved in a sexual relationship with Bianca's partner Tony King. [[BBC News]] described the plot as an ongoing "predatory paedophile storyline", noting that this was the first time this subject matter had been tackled by a UK soap opera.&lt;ref name="beeb"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[BBC News]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7613307.stm | title = Will sex offender pilots work? | first=Dominic |last=Casciani|date=15 September 2008|accessdate=15 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline was conceived when ''EastEnders'' series consultant [[Simon Ashdown]] viewed a documentary about homelessness, featuring a mother and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go. Ashdown questioned what might happen if a paedophile were to befriend the mother in order to grow closer to the child, and related the scenario to Bianca's return to the soap. BBC Head of Drama [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]] explained that the idea when presented "drew a sharp intake of breath. Most ''EastEnders'' stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

The idea that McGarty play a child groomed for sex was put to the actress on 9 January 2008. Santer has stated that, had McGarty or her parents objected to the storyline, they would not have gone ahead with it. In the event, McGarty's parents merely requested that their daughter not be asked to publicise the role, and the actress began filming her first scenes on 14 January 2008.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

==Development==

===Sexual abuse===
In order to develop Whitney's sexual abuse storyline, by March 2008 ''EastEnders'' researchers Libby Duplock and Cleo Bicat were in contact with the [[NSPCC]]'s Tom Narducci, Jude Toasland, who deals with abused children, and Yvonne Traynor, CEO of the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre. Duplock has stated that: "One thing that was quite difficult for me to get right was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused is going to go on to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show "feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it [and] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they can do something about it. [...] We're not trying to cause a national panic. This is a responsible effort to try to get over an important story."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

It had initially been decided that, alongside Tony's sexual abuse, Whitney would be seen to [[self-harm]]. This aspect of the storyline was discarded, after the NSPCC suggested that it may distract from the main issue of her abuse. Final approval for the storyline was sought from BBC Head of Fiction [[Jane Tranter]] on 2 June 2008. Tranter explained:

:"I thought it was a fantastically good idea. The big moments in ''EastEnders'', those iconic pieces of television history, tend to be the things that are incredibly near the knuckle, and are actually quite difficult subjects to raise in the context of a family sitting room. [...] Soaps are meant to hold up a mirror to our lives, and sometimes that mirror will show ugly bits, difficult bits, taboo bits. But if a soap doesn't hold up that mirror, then actually, what is it? It will have no depth."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

Chris Coghill was cast as Whitney's abuser Tony on 20 June 2008. Upon accepting the role, he commented: "Shona doesn't act, or look, like a little child. Which helps."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; He has added of their off-screen relationship: "Shona's fantastic to work with. She's very natural, very instinctive and a natural actress.

===Sexual exploitation===
In January 2011, it was announced that Whitney would be part of an upcoming storyline on sexual exploitation. Whitney is left alone and vulnerable, and falls for a man, [[Rob Grayson]], played by [[Jody Latham]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pendletoday.co.uk/news/local-news/barrowford_actor_jody_latham_to_appear_in_eastenders_1_2928859|title=Barrowford actor Jody Latham to appear in ‘Eastenders’|work=Pendle Today|publisher=[[Johnston Publishing]]|accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who exploits her for financial gain. ''EastEnders'' worked alongside charity [[Comic Relief]] on the storyline, which started planning in 2010. The storyline culminated during [[Red Nose Day 2011]] on 19 March 2011, in a special ten-minute episode. Gilly Green, Head of UK Grants at Comic Relief, said: "It is vital that we continue to alert young people to the dangers if we are to stop them being exploited and the opportunity to work with ''EastEnders'' will make a huge audience aware of this issue. We have been working with the ''EastEnders'' script writers and some of the young women from projects we support to ensure the story reflects the reality of young people caught up in sexual exploitation."&lt;ref name="Humphreys"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eastenders/2011/01/comicrelief.shtml|title=EastEnders working with Comic Relief|last=Humphreys|first=Matt|date=9 January 2011|work=EastEnders|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Cahill, Chief Executive of Comic Relief, added "We have worked over many years with ''EastEnders'' in all kinds of ways. It's been a real pleasure this year to work together on a piece of serious drama, in the best traditions of public service, which will highlight an important issue and also, because it occurs on the night of Comic Relief, actually help raise crucial funds to help young women caught up in it."&lt;ref name="Humphreys" /&gt; The storyline begins when Bianca is sent to prison and Whitney rejects her family, moving in with Janine and attempting to make money by stealing from The Queen Victoria, causing her to get sacked, working for Max, whom she tries to kiss as she has a crush on him, and pickpocketing. When she is caught, Rob rescues her from the situation and offers her what McGarty called a "dream life", which Whitney thinks is her chance to move up in the world as she feels lonely and has no friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lamacraft|first=Tess|date=19 February 2011|title=Whit does a moonlight flit!|journal=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|Buzz]]|publisher=[[News Group Newspapers]]|location=[[London]]|issue=22|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGarty told ''[[Inside Soap]]'' that she hoped the storyline would have a positive impact, saying that she had done some research herself before filming, meeting teenage girls who had been exploited and hearing their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a304385/mcgarty-hopes-for-positive-enders-impact.html|title=McGarty hopes for positive 'Enders impact|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=23 February 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=23 February 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said she felt honoured and privileged to be given the storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a305419/mcgarty-honoured-by-eastenders-plot.html|title=McGarty "honoured" by 'EastEnders' plot|last=Love|first=Ryan|date=23 February 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=23 February 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporary departure===
McGarty was suspended from the show in July 2012 across four weeks for "persistent lateness to arrive on set". A show insider described her lateness as a big problem because it "regularly held up the filming of vital scenes." McGarty apologised for her lateness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a393398/shona-mcgarty-suspended-from-eastenders-for-persistent-lateness/|title=Shona McGarty suspended from 'EastEnders' for persistent lateness|last=Bell|first=Amy|date=15 July 2012|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, she discussed her suspension with ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' magazine ''Fabulous'' and said her actions were "lazy and irresponsible" and the suspension made her realise the consequences of her actions. McGarty promised fans that she was now punctual for work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a817921/eastenders-shona-mcgarty-regrets-suspension/|title=Shona McGarty regrets getting in trouble with EastEnders: 'I was lazy and irresponsible'|last=Houghton|first=Rianne|date=30 December 2016|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other appearances==
&lt;!-- need to add Last Tango in Walford --&gt;Whitney makes a cameo appearance in episode eight of the second series of the Internet spin-off series ''[[EastEnders: E20]]'', in which she buys some trainers from [[Asher Levi]] ([[Heshima Thompson]]) but later returns them as they are of different sizes. [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) joins the argument and snatches Asher's wallet when he says he does not give refunds, but he snatches it back. Jane tells two police officers he is a thief and they chase after him.

==Reception==
The [[BBC]] and television regulatory body [[Ofcom]] received 70 complaints after Whitney's first scenes with Tony aired.&lt;ref name="MailComplaints"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1056737/Scores-complaints-EastEnders-shows-scenes-paedophile-grooming-teenager.html |title=Scores of complaints as EastEnders shows scenes of a paedophile grooming a teenager|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|first=Paul|last=Revoir|date=17 September 2008|accessdate=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A BBC spokesman responded: "This is a difficult and challenging storyline, but one which keeps with the tradition of the show for tackling difficult social issues such as domestic abuse and mental health in the past. All the content on screen adheres to the BBC's editorial guidelines."&lt;ref name="SunComplaints"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/article1701370.ece|title=Complaints over paedo plot|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|publisher=[[News International]]|first=Cara|last=Lee|date=17 September 2008|accessdate=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'s}} [[Aida Edemariam]] said of the beginning of the storyline: "what is most disturbing, watching [Tony and Whitney's] first scenes together, is not the sexuality of the situation per se, though that is uncomfortable - it's the subtle [[emotional blackmail|blackmail]] with which he keeps her in line. As it's combined with the [[psychological manipulation|emotional manipulation]] native to soaps, the viewer starts to feel a bit bullied, too."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Numbers of viewer complaints rose within days to over 200.&lt;ref name="205Comp"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/847004/EastEnders-paedophile-plot-sparks-200-complaints/|title=EastEnders paedophile plot sparks over 200 complaints|work=Brand Republic|publisher=[[Haymarket Group]]|first=Nikki|last=Sandison|date=18 September 2008|accessdate=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardiancomp"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/18/bbc.television|title=EastEnders paedophile storyline draws 200 complaints|first=Leigh|last=Holmwood|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=18 September 2008|accessdate=6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New Statesman]]'' journalist Jeremy Sare commented on the public outrage and defended ''EastEnders'' decision to air the storyline, writing:

:"There may be some justification for the hundreds complaining about these distressing issues being presented in prime time: equally it is courageous for the Beeb to include a scenario which challenges the public’s perception of what is a ‘typical paedophile’. The repellent Tony’s grooming and seduction of his stepdaughter, Whitney, is a much more familiar pattern of abuse than the more commonly held image of predators lurking in parks. [...] The producers of Eastenders, labouring under a welter of tabloid protest and viewers’ complaints, are attempting to make people get past the initial revulsion of the act of abuse and accept the grim fact that ‘paedophiles’ are very often members of the same family."&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/law-and-reform/2008/09/sex-offenders-children-sarah|title=The dangers of Sarah's law|work=[[New Statesman]]|first=Jeremy|last=Sare|date=22 September 2008|accessdate=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sare quoted a BBC spokeswoman as saying: "we appreciate that for some viewers this storyline will have particular resonance and significance. In running it, it's certainly not our intention to cause distress or upset, either to those who've suffered from sexual abuse or their families. Our aim is instead to raise awareness of this very sensitive issue",&lt;ref name="NS" /&gt; concluding his article with the summation: "The producers' dilemma is instructive to children’s charities and Ministers alike on how to confront the issue in a digestible manner which can stimulate an objective debate."&lt;ref name="NS" /&gt;

The ''[[Daily Mirror]]''{{'s}} Beth Neil branded the plot strand "one of the darkest and most disturbing storylines ''EastEnders'' has ever attempted",&lt;ref name="darkest"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news-old/top-stories/2008/09/26/exclusive-eastenders-tony-king-and-the-other-most-evil-characters-in-soap-115875-20753242/|title=Exclusive: EastEnders' Tony King and the other most evil characters in soap|first=Beth|last=Neil|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=26 September 2008|accessdate=6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with critic [[Jim Shelley (TV critic)|Jim Shelley]] deeming it a "new low" for ''EastEnders''.&lt;ref name="low"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv-entertainment/columnists/jim-shelley/2008/09/15/new-low-of-the-week-eastenders-115875-20737944/|title=New low of the week: EastEnders|first=Jim|last=Shelley|authorlink=Jim Shelley (TV critic)|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=15 September 2008|accessdate=6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley wrote of Whitney's abuse: "You've really got to hand it to ''EastEnders''. Just when you thought the show couldn't get any more miserable, the writers come up trumps and produce a new way of making us depressed - a paedophile storyline. Thanks for that! I realise now this is what the family meal has been missing three nights a week: gathering the telly to watch a grubby, greasyhaired thug drooling over a 15-year-old girl who (as luck would have it) spends her entire life in her school uniform even when she's not at school. And they say family entertainment's dead."&lt;ref name="shelley"&gt;*{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv-entertainment/columnists/jim-shelley/2008/09/29/sick-love-triangle-is-a-new-low-in-eastenders-albert-square-115875-20759715/|title=Sick love triangle is a new low in EastEnders Albert Square|first=Jim|last=Shelley|authorlink=Jim Shelley (TV critic)|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=29 September 2008|accessdate=6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley refuted the BBC's claims that the storyline had educational value as "totally bogus", observing that "At 7.30 or 8pm, the "action" has to be so coded as to be pointless".&lt;ref name="shelley" /&gt; Deborah Orr, writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', similarly disagreed with the BBC's statement that the storyline was part of ''EastEnders''' "rich heritage of tackling difficult social issues",&lt;ref name="orr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/deborah-orr/deborah-orr-better-trust-the-government-than-the-free-marketeers-936164.html|title=A controversy too far for 'EastEnders'|first=Deborah|last=Orr|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Limited|date=20 September 2008|accessdate=6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing that:

:"Actually, it's part of its rich heritage of leaping in to some horrific subject without any background or build-up at all. The implication is that Tony, the villain, had been grooming the child for some time before he went to prison, when she was only 12. But such a thing really would be too real, and too controversial, so the viewer only gets to see the result of those hinted-at dark machinations.

:"It might be a public service to dramatise the manner in which a paedophile might worm his way into a vulnerable family. But such a storyline would have to be explored carefully and over a long period. All that this little adventure in broadcasting can possibly deliver is the message that a paedophile in the heart of the home is not a good thing. Who needs to be educated about this?"&lt;ref name="orr" /&gt;

The ''[[Daily Mail]]''{{'s}} Lizzie Smith deemed the storyline "horrifying",&lt;ref name="horrifying"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1054810/EastEnders-tackles-paedophilia-horrifying-child-abuse-plotline.html|title=Now EastEnders tackles paedophilia with horrifying child abuse 'grooming' plotline|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|first=Lizzie|last=Smith|date=12 September 2008|accessdate=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'s}} Julie Raeside questioned: "Is this latest sexual abuse storyline a good thing to position in a pre-watershed soap opera, or should the ''EastEnders'' storyliners stick to a less controversial brand of misery?"&lt;ref name="raeside"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/jul/02/eastendersplotschildsexabu|title=EastEnders: no stranger to controversial storylines|first=Julie|last=Raeside|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=2 July 2008|accessdate=6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in contrast to public and media dissent, the [[NSPCC]]'s director of communications, John Grounds, praised the storyline for "helping to raise awareness of the hidden nature of sexual abuse",&lt;ref name="nspcc"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/02/bbc.television|title=EastEnders to tackle child sex abuse|first=Leigh|last=Holmwood|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=2 July 2008|accessdate=6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; deeming it to be "vital in persuading people to take action to stop it and encouraging children to speak out."&lt;ref name="nspcc" /&gt;

Episodes from Whitney's storyline were submitted to the [[Royal Television Society]] Programme Awards 2008 for a panel to judge in the category Soap and Continuing Drama. ''EastEnders'' was presented with the award in March 2009, beating ''[[Coronation Street]]'' and ''[[The Bill]]''.
