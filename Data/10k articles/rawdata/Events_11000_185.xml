The '''2012–2013 Cypriot financial crisis''' was an [[economic crisis]] in the [[Republic of Cyprus]] that involved the exposure of Cypriot banks to overleveraged local property companies, the [[Greek government-debt crisis]], the downgrading of the [[Government of Cyprus|Cypriot government's]] [[bond credit rating]] to junk status by international [[Credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]], the consequential inability to refund its state expenses from the international markets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/06/201262517189248721.html |title=Cyprus asks EU for financial bailout – Europe |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thecypruslawyer.com/cypriot-banks-in-the-aftermath-of-the-greek-haircut/cyprus-news |title=Cypriot banks in the aftermath of the Greek haircut |publisher=The Cyprus Lawyer |date=26 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the reluctance of the government to restructure the troubled Cypriot financial sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/business/global/25iht-dixon25.html |title=Cyprus Refuses to Learn From Its Mistakes |publisher=The New York Times no |accessdate=2 April 2013 |first=Hugo |last=Dixon |date=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 2013, a €10 billion international [[bailout]] by the [[Eurogroup]], [[European Commission]] (EC), [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) and [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) was announced, in return for Cyprus agreeing to close the country's second-largest bank, the [[Cyprus Popular Bank]] (also known as Laiki Bank), imposing a one-time [[bank deposit levy]] on all uninsured deposits there, and possibly around 48% of uninsured deposits in the [[Bank of Cyprus]] (the island's largest [[commercial bank]]). A minority proportion of it held by citizens of other countries (many of whom [[Russians in Cyprus|from Russia]]), who preferred Cypriot banks because of their higher interest on bank account deposits, relatively low corporate tax, and easier access to the rest of the European banking sector. This resulted in numerous insinuations by US and European media, which presented Cyprus as a 'tax haven' and  suggested that the prospective bailout loans were meant for saving the accounts of Russian depositors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/cypriot-banks-to-reopen-amid-criticism-of-bailout/2013/03/27/dd56757c-96e1-11e2-b68f-dc5c4b47e519_story.html|title=Cypriot banks to reopen amid criticism of bailout|publisher=The Washington Post|date=27 March 2013 |first=Max |last=Ehrenfreund}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/03/26/cyprus-disaster-shines-light-on-global-tax-haven-industry/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327212857/http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/03/26/cyprus-disaster-shines-light-on-global-tax-haven-industry/ |archivedate=2013-03-27 |publisher=MSNBC|date=26 March 2013 |title=Cyprus disaster shines light on global tax haven industry no |accessdate=2 April 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; No [[Deposit insurance|insured deposit]] of €100,000 or less would be affected.&lt;ref name=ReutersNewdeal&gt;{{cite news |author=Jan Strupczewski |author2=Annika Breidthardt |title=Last-minute Cyprus deal to close bank, force losses |publisher=Reuters |date=25 March 2013 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/25/us-cyprus-parliament-idUSBRE92G03I20130325 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325042059/https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/25/us-cyprus-parliament-idUSBRE92G03I20130325 |archivedate=2013-03-25 |accessdate=25 March 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ekathimerini&gt;{{cite news |title=Eurogroup signs off on bailout agreement reached by Cyprus and troika |newspaper=Ekathimerini |location=Greece |date=25 March 2013 |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_25/03/2013_489702 |accessdate=25 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
[[File:Cypriot debt and EU average.png|thumb|upright=1.35|alt=Cypriot debt compared to Eurozone average|Cyprus's debt-to-GDP percentage compared to Eurozone average since 1999]]

The United States' [[subprime mortgage crisis]] in 2007–2008 led to a domino effect of negative consequences in the global economy including the [[European sovereign-debt crisis|European Union]]. The Cypriot economy went into [[recession]] in 2009, as the economy shrank by 1.67%,&lt;ref name="theglobaleconomy.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Cyprus/indicator-NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG/|title=Cyprus: Economic Growth, Cyprus GDP growth rate|work=TheGlobalEconomy.com|date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225162301/http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Cyprus/indicator-NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG/|archivedate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with large falls specifically in the [[Tourism in Cyprus|tourism]] and shipping sectors&lt;ref name="kpfa.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kpfa.org/episode/89875/ |title=Up Front – March 19, 2013 at 7:00am KPFA 94.1 FM Berkeley: Listener Sponsored Free Speech Radio&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; which caused rising unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indexmundi.com/cyprus/unemployment_rate.html |title=Cyprus Unemployment rate – Economy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic growth between 2010 and 2012 was weak and failed to reach its pre-2009 levels.&lt;ref name="theglobaleconomy.com"/&gt; Commercial property values declined by approximately 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joinricsineurope.eu/uploads/files/RICSIndexQ42012Final.ppt |title=RICS Cyprus Property Index Q4 2012 |publisher=RICS Europe |accessdate=14 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001156/http://www.joinricsineurope.eu/uploads/files/RICSIndexQ42012Final.ppt |archive-date=31 December 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Non-performing loan]]s rose to a reported 6.1% in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FB.AST.NPER.ZS |title=Bank nonperforming loans to total gross loans (%)  |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=14 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing pressure on the banking system. With a small population and modest economy, Cyprus had a large [[offshore bank]]ing industry. Compared to a [[nominal GDP]] of €19.5bn ($24bn)&lt;ref name=imf2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=39&amp;pr.y=3&amp;sy=2009&amp;ey=2012&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=423&amp;s=NGDPD%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC%2CLP&amp;grp=0&amp;a= |title=Cyprus |publisher=International Monetary Fund |accessdate=18 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the banks had amassed €22 billion of Greek private-sector debt with bank deposits $120bn, including $60bn from Russia business corporations.&lt;ref name=NYT612Cyprus/&gt; [[Russian oligarch]] [[Dmitry Rybolovlev]] owned a 10% shareholding of [[Bank of Cyprus]].&lt;ref name=NYT612Cyprus&gt;{{cite news|title=Rates on Spanish Bond Soar|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/13/business/global/daily-euro-zone-watch.html|accessdate=12 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 June 2012|author=Stephen Castle|author2=David Jolly }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Eurozone crisis live: Spain told to cut harder as Greek deal approved |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/13/eurozone-crisis-greek-deal-spain-austerity#block-2 |date=13 March 2012 |accessdate=13 March 2012 |location=London |first=Graeme |last=Wearden}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FT625&gt;{{cite news|title=Cyprus requests eurozone bailout|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/80320e0e-bed0-11e1-b24b-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=25 June 2012|newspaper=Financial Times|date=25 June 2012|author=James Wilson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyprus banks first came under severe financial pressure as bad debt ratios rose. Former Laiki CEO Efthimios Bouloutas admitted that his bank was probably insolvent as early as 2008, even before Cyprus entered the Eurozone. The banks were then exposed to a [[Haircut (finance)|haircut]] of upwards of 50% in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/03/31/theres-something-very-strange-about-the-cyprus-bank-haircut-very-strange-indeed/|title=There's Something Very Strange About The Cyprus Bank Haircut. Very Strange Indeed|author=Tim Worstall|date=31 March 2013|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Greek government-debt crisis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketplace.org/2012/02/21/world/greek-debt-crisis/greek-bond-investors-take-big-haircut-bailout-deal |title=Greek bond investors take big 'haircut' in bailout deal Marketplace.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neurope.eu/article/greek-debt-haircut-takes/ |title=Greek debt 'haircut' takes off New Europe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to fears of a collapse of the Cypriot banks. The Cypriot state, unable to raise liquidity from the markets to support its financial sector, requested a bailout from the European Union.&lt;ref name="kpfa.org"/&gt;

Progress on fiscal and structural reforms was slow and following a [[Evangelos Florakis Naval Base explosion|serious, accidental explosion in July 2011]] at the [[Evangelos Florakis Naval Base]] the [[Credit rating agency|major credit rating agencies]] downgraded the country's rating in September. Yields on its [[Bond (finance)|long-term bonds]] rose above 12% and there was concern that the country would be unable to stabilize its banks.

==Response==

===Emergency loan (2012)===
Since January 2012, Cyprus had been relying on a €2.5bn (US$3.236 billion) emergency loan from Russia to cover its budget deficit and re-finance maturing debt. The loan has an interest rate of 4.5%, with no amortization/repayment until its maturity ends after 4.5 years, and no penalty if repayment at that point of time will be delayed, in the event of a persisting lack of access for Cyprus to cover its financial needs through the normal funding markets.&lt;ref name="ft.com"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Cyprus nears €2.5bn Russian loan deal |newspaper=Financial Times |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/655a3fd2-de31-11e0-9fb7-00144feabdc0.html |first1=Andreas |last1=Hadjipapas |first2=Kerin |last2=Hope |date=14 September 2011 |accessdate=13 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Natalie Weeks|author2=Scott Rose|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-12-23/cyprus-russia-sign-2-5-billion-euro-loan-deal-in-moscow-1-|title=Cyprus and Russia signed a deal for a 2.5 billion-euro ($3.3 billion) loan|publisher=Bloomberg Business|date=24 December 2011|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The received loan was expected to cover all refinancing of maturing government debt and the amount needed for the governments continued budget deficits, until the first quarter of 2013. But the received loan did not include any funds for recapitalization of the Cypriot financial sector. Looking further ahead, it was generally expected Cyprus would need to apply for an additional bailout loan.&lt;ref name="ft.com"/&gt;

==Criticism==

* Irish MEP [[Nessa Childers]], daughter of the country's former President [[Erskine Hamilton Childers|Erskine H. Childers]], painted a bleak picture. She described the efforts of the EU-IMF as an "incompetent mess" and said the Eurozone was more destabilised as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/mep-childers-cyprus-bailout-an-incompetent-mess-589407.html|title=MEP Childers: Cyprus bailout an 'incompetent mess'|newspaper=[[Irish Examiner]]|publisher=[[Thomas Crosbie Holdings]]|date=27 March 2013|accessdate=27 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In its Schumpeter blog [[The Economist]] called the Cyprus bail-out unfair, short-sighted and self-defeating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2013/03/cyprus-bail-out |title=The Cyprus bail-out: Unfair, short-sighted and self-defeating |work=The Economist |location=UK |date=16 March 2013 |accessdate=20 March 2013 |first=Graeme |last=Wearden }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Specifically the article says {{Quote|text=The Cypriot deal has no coherence in the larger context. The [[European sovereign-debt crisis|euro crisis]] has been in abeyance for a few months, thanks largely to the readiness of the [[European Central Bank]] to intervene to help struggling countries. The ECB's price for helping countries is to insist they go into a bail-out programme. The political price of going into a programme has just gone up, so the ECB's safety net looks a little thinner.

The bail-out appears to move Europe further away from the institutional reforms that are needed to resolve the crisis once and for all. Rather than using the European Stability Mechanism to recapitalise banks, and thereby weaken the link between banks and their governments, the euro zone continues to equate bank bail-outs with sovereign bail-outs. As for debt mutualisation, after imposing losses on local depositors, the price of support from the rest of Europe is arguably costlier now than it ever has been.}}

* Dr. Jeffrey Stacey wrote in Germany's [[Der Spiegel]], under the headline "'Abject Error': How the Cyprus Deal Hurts EU Strategic Interests":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/cyprus-bailout-woes-harmful-to-eu-strategic-interests-a-892331.html |title='Abject Error': How the Cyprus Deal Hurts EU Strategic Interests |work=Der Spiegel |location=Germany |date=3 April 2013 |accessdate=4 April 2013 |first=Graeme |last=Wearden }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text=In strategic terms the EU hurt not only Cyprus and itself, but also the interests of the US and other allies in the West. Europe pushed Cyprus directly into the arms of the Russian government. Not only did this hurt the prospects for its own deal, but it gave leverage to Moscow in the process.

More important still, however, by forcing [[Nicos Anastasiades|Anastasiades]] between the rock of a forced bank levy and the hard place of seeking assistance from Moscow, the EU seriously undermined him domestically precisely when the West was about to reap the benefits at long last of a fairly pro-Western Cypriot president, crucially necessary to overcome sour relations with Turkey that continue to undermine [[NATO]] relations, EU relations, [[Transatlantic relations|NATO-EU relations]], and US relations with both.
To top it all off, a peace deal along the lines of the [[Annan Plan for Cyprus|Annan Plan]] for a final resolution of the 40-year-old [[Cyprus dispute|Cypriot divide]] – the prospects for which had improved with the election of Anastasiades – has seen its prospects diminished.}}

*Economist [[Richard D. Wolff]] commented in an interview in relation to the Cyprus bailout agreement as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://citizenactionmonitor.wordpress.com/2013/03/28/events-in-cyprus-expose-eu-plan-to-steal-peoples-savings-and-bailout-private-banks/ |title = Events in Cyprus expose EU plan to steal peoples' savings and bailout private banks |publisher =  |date = 31 March 2013 |website = Citizen Action Monitor |accessdate= 17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text= This is blackmail. This is basically the officials of the banks and the political leaders going to the mass of people and saying to them, "This awful deal that makes you, who have nothing to do with the crisis and didn't get any bailout, pay the costs of the crisis and the bailout. You must do this, because if you don't, we will do even more damage to you and your economy. So give us your deposits, give us your money, pay more taxes, suffer fewer social programs, because if you don't, we will impose even worse on you." It's the basic idea of austerity across the board and in our country, too. And I think it's the confrontation of a system that does not work with the mass of the people, saying, "We will go down and take you with us, unless you bail us out." }}

[[File:Eras protest 8th nov 2012 cy.JPG|thumb|Members of ERAS outside of the [[House of Representatives (Cyprus)|House of Representatives]] in [[Nicosia]]]]
Cyprus has seen a number of reactions and responses towards the austerity measures of the bailout plan. On 8 November 2012, the Cypriot far-left party [[Committee for a Radical Left Rally]] (ERAS) organized the first protest against austerity while the Troika negotiations were still taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BDigital Web Solutions |url=http://www.kathimerini.com.cy/index.php?pageaction=kat&amp;modid=1&amp;artid=111637|title=Την Πέμπτη η πρώτη εκδήλωση διαμαρτυρίας κατά του Μνημονίου &amp;#124; Κύπρος &amp;#124; Η ΚΑΘΗΜΕΡΙΝΗ |publisher=Kathimerini.com.cy |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters were gathered outside the [[House of Representatives (Cyprus)|House of Representatives]] holding banners and shouting slogans against austerity. Leaflets with alternative proposals for the economy were distributed in the protest, with proposals including the nationalization of banking, the reduction of the army and the freezing of the army budget, and the increase of the corporate tax. Members of the [[New Internationalist Left (Cyprus)|New Internationalist Left]] (NEDA) also participated in the protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlycy.com/250156-%CF%83%CF%85%CE%B3%CE%BA%CE%AD%CE%BD%CF%84%CF%81%CF%89%CF%83%CE%B7-%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%B1%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%84%CF%85%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B1%CF%82-%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%83-%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B6%CE%BF%CF%83|script-title=el:Συγκέντρωση διαμαρτυρίας από την ΕΡΑΣ κατά του μνημονίου και της Τρόικας μπροστά από τη Βουλή|trans-title=Gathering protest from ERAS against the Troika memorandum in front of Parliament|language=el|publisher=Onlycy.com|date=8 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111044649/http://www.onlycy.com/250156-%CF%83%CF%85%CE%B3%CE%BA%CE%AD%CE%BD%CF%84%CF%81%CF%89%CF%83%CE%B7-%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%B1%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%84%CF%85%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B1%CF%82-%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%83-%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B6%CE%BF%CF%83|archivedate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 November the [[New Internationalist Left (Cyprus)|New Internationalist Left]] organised an anti-austerity protest outside the Ministry of Finance in Nicosia together with the Alliance Against the Memorandum. In the protest NEDA gave out leaflets, which expressed the view that "the EU is trying to burden the workers with the debts from the collapse of the bankers" and that "if this happens, the Cypriot economy and the future of the new generations will then be mortgaged to local and foreign profiteers and usurious bankers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/Eidiseis-Kypros/22/122786/ekdilosi-diamartyrias-kata-ttis-troikas-exo-apo-to-ypoik |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130131070038/http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/Eidiseis-Kypros/22/122786/ekdilosi-diamartyrias-kata-ttis-troikas-exo-apo-to-ypoik |archive-date=2013-01-31 |title=Εκδήλωση διαμαρτυρίας κατά της Τρόικας έξω από το ΥΠΟΙΚ |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of protests took place on 12 December. Members of large families protested outside the House of Representatives against cuts in the benefits given by the state to support large families. Protesters threw eggs and stones at the main entrance of the parliament, and a number of protesters tried to enter the building, but were blocked by the police force that arrived to handle the protest. It was reported that a woman fainted during the incidents. The protesters shouted for the MPs to come out but no response was given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sigmalive.com/news/local/20781/symplokes-sti-vouli-sti-diamartyria-ton-polyteknonvinteo |title=Συμπλοκές στη Βουλή στη διαμαρτυρία των πολυτέκνων(βίντεο) &amp;#124; News |publisher=Sigmalive.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protesters were joined by members of KISOA (Cypriot Confederation of Organisations of the Disabled, ''Κυπριακή Συνομοσπονδία Οργανώσεων Αναπήρων''), who marched from the Ministry of Finance to the House of Representatives to protest against cuts in benefits for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sigmalive.com/news/local/20803/stous-dromous-kai-oi-anapiroi |title=Στους δρόμους και οι ανάπηροι  |publisher=Sigmalive.com  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the day members of public school teachers' trade unions protested outside the Ministry of Finance against the cuts in education spending which could result in the firing of teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sigmalive.com/news/local/20874/antidroun-kai-oi-ekpaideftikes-organoseis |title=Αντιδρούν και οι εκπαιδευτικές οργανώσεις &amp;#124; News |publisher=Sigmalive.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The unions staged another protest the next day near the House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sigmalive.com/news/local/21003/ypo-drakonteia-metra-i-diadilosi-ton-ekpaideftikon |title=Υπό δρακόντεια μέτρα η διαδήλωση των εκπαιδευτικών  |publisher=Sigmalive.com  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-EU bank depositors==
Non-resident investors who held deposits prior to 15 March 2013 when the plan to impose losses on savers was first formulated, and who lost at least three million [[euro]]s would be eligible to apply for [[Cypriot nationality law|Cypriot citizenship]]. Cyprus's existing "citizenship by investment" program would be revised to reduce the amount of investment required to be eligible for the program to three million euros from the previous ten million euros. "These decisions will be deployed in a fast-track manner", [[Nicos Anastasiades|Anastasiades]] said in an address to [[Russians in Cyprus|Russian business people]] in the port city of [[Limassol]] in 2013. Other measures were also under consideration, he said, including offering tax incentives for existing or new companies doing business in Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyprus-president-russia-idUSBRE93D09720130414 |title=Cyprus to ease citizenship requirements, attacks EU "hypocrisy" |publisher=Reuters.com |date= 14 April 2013|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22147643 |title=Cyprus to ease citizenship rules for EU bailout losers |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=14 April 2013 |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
A team of 16 Cypriot economists, organized by the citizens group ''Eleutheria'' ("Freedom"),&lt;ref&gt;[[Greek language|Greek]] ''ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΙΑ''&lt;/ref&gt; attributed the crisis to sliding competitiveness, increasing public and private debt, exacerbated by the banking crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Η τριλογία της αποτυχίας μας, in the Cyprus daily newspaper Φιλελεύθερος dated 9 September 2012, economics section, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''See also [[Alcazar Theatre (1911)]] and [[Alcazar Theatre (1976)]] for two other SF theaters of the same name.''

The '''Alcazar Theatre''' was a [[theater (structure)|theatre]] at 116 O'Farrell Street, between Stockton and Powell, in [[San Francisco, California]]. Opened in 1885, the structure served as a [[lecture]] and [[music hall]], but soon housed a popular resident [[repertory|stock company]], which included [[Maude Adams]], under the management of the younger brother of [[David Belasco]], [[Fred Belasco]].

The Alcazar Theatre was destroyed in the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]. In 1911, another [[Alcazar Theatre (1911)|Alcazar Theatre]] opened one block to the west.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20228">Following the termination of hostilities in [[World War II]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were in control of the defeated [[Axis Powers|Axis]] countries.  Anticipating the defeat of Germany and Japan, they had already set up the [[European Advisory Commission]] and a proposed [[Far Eastern Advisory Commission]] to make recommendations for the post war period. Accordingly, they managed their control of the defeated countries through '''Allied Commissions''', often referred to as '''Allied Control Commissions''' ('''ACC'''), consisting of representatives of the major Allies.

==Italy==
Under the provisions of Article 37 in the [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/italy03.asp Armistice with Italy Instrument of Surrender], September 29, 1943, the Control Commission for Italy was established on November 10, 1943  and was dismantled following the conclusion of the Italian [[Peace Treaty]] at the [[Paris Peace Conference (1947)|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1947.

==Romania==

[[Image:OrderOfVictory.jpg|thumb|right|220px|King [[Michael I of Romania]] was awarded the [[Order of Victory]] (the highest Soviet order) for overthrowing the pro-German [[Mareşal (Romania)|Marshal]] [[Ion Antonescu|Antonescu]] in the [[The royal coup (Romania)|August 23 coup]].]]
[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/rumania.asp The Armistice Agreement with Rumania], signed on September 12, 1944, established, among others, the following:
*Article 1 ''"As from August 24, 1944, at four a.m., Rumania has entirely discontinued military operations against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on all theaters of war, has withdrawn from the war against the United Nations, has broken off relations with Germany and her satellites, has entered the war and will wage war on the side of the Allied Powers against Germany and Hungary for the purpose of restoring Rumanian independence and sovereignty, for which purpose she provides not less than twelve infantry divisions with corps troops."''
*Article 4 ''"The state frontier between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Rumania, established by the Soviet-Rumanian Agreement of June 8, 1940, is restored."''
*Article 18 "''An Allied Control Commission will be established which will undertake until the conclusion of peace the regulation of and control over the execution of the present terms under the general direction and orders of the Allied (Soviet) High Command, acting on behalf of the Allied Powers"''. In the Annex to Article 18, it was made clear that "''The Romanian Government and their organs shall fulfill all instructions of the Allied Control Commission arising out of the Armistice Agreement.''" and that the Allied Control Commission would have its seat in [[Bucharest]].
*Article 19 "''The Allied Governments regard the decision of the [[Second Vienna Award|Vienna award]] regarding Transylvania as and void and are agreed that Transylvania the greater part thereof) should be returned to Rumania, subject to confirmation at the peace settlement, and the Soviet Government agrees that Soviet forces shall take part for this purpose in joint military operations with Rumania against Germany and Hungary."''

In line with Article 14 of the Armistice Agreement two [[Romanian People's Tribunals]] were set up to try suspected war criminals. The [[Treaty of Peace with Romania, 1947|Treaty of Peace with Romania]] was signed on February 10, 1947 and entered into force on September 15, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/usmu011.asp Treaty of Peace with Romania], [[Avalon Project]], [[Yale University]] Retrieved 2008-12-28&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission, placed under the nominal leadership of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] general [[Rodion Malinovsky]] (represented by [[Vladislav Petrovich Vinogradov]]) and was dominated by [[Red Army]] leaders.

The Commission was one of the tools used by the [[Soviet Union]] to impose communist rule in [[Communist Romania|Romania]]. Soviet occupation forces remained in Romania until 1958 and the country became a [[satellite state]] of the Soviet Union, joining the [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[COMECON]].

==Finland==
[[Image:Hotelli Torni,Helsinki.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In [[Helsinki]] the Allied Control Commission occupied the [[Hotel Torni|Hotel ''Torni'']].]] 
The Allied Control Commission (ACC) arrived in Finland on September 22, 1944 to observe Finnish compliance with the [[Moscow armistice]]. It consisted of 200 Soviet and 15 British members and was led by Col. Gen. [[Andrei Zhdanov]]. Immediately after its inception, the commission required Finland to take more vigorous action to intern the German forces in Northern Finland. Finland's compliance with the commission resulted in a [[Lapland War|campaign to force out the remaining German troops in the area]]. Simultaneously, Finland was required to [[demobilization|demobilize]], which was also required by the commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heninen.net/sopimus/1944_e.htm Armistice Agreement between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,on the one hand, and Finland on the other]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACC provided Finland with a list of war criminals against whom Finland had to start judicial proceedings. Although this required Finnish post-facto legislation, Finland was the only country on the losing side of the war that was allowed to try its own war criminals. The ACC interfered with the [[war-responsibility trials in Finland|war-responsibility trials]] by requiring longer prison sentences than the preliminary verdict would have contained. The ACC also strove to change the Finnish political life by requiring a number of allegedly fascist (in practice anti-Soviet) organizations to be banned, among them the [[Suojeluskunta|Civil Guard]]. Furthermore, the ACC required the forced return of all Soviet citizens, including [[Ingrian Finns]] and [[Estonia]]ns, to the Soviet Union.

After the war, the Finnish military placed part of the weapons of the demobilized troops into several hundred caches distributed around the country. The caches would have been used to arm guerillas in case of a Soviet occupation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} When the matter was leaked to the public, the commission required Finnish authorities to investigate and prosecute the officers and men responsible for the caching. The [[Weapons Cache Case]] was followed closely until the ACC determined that the case was purely a military operation. The Allied Control Commission left Finland September 26, 1947, when the Soviet Union finally ratified the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty]].

==Bulgaria==

* Article 13: property belonging to the Axis powers of Germany and Hungary must not be returned without permission of the Control Commission.

==Germany==
The [[Allied Control Council]] (ACC) for [[Germany]] oversaw the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany]]. The ACC was established by agreement of June 5, 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video
 | year =1945
 | title =Video: Allies Sign Control Law For Germany,1945/06/14 (1945)

}}&lt;/ref&gt; supplemented by agreement of September 20 of that same year, with its seat in [[Berlin]]. Its members were Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States of America. Decisions could only be made by consensus. From the outset; proceedings were heavily compromised through systematic non-cooperation from the French representatives.  The French had been excluded (at American insistence) from the [[Potsdam Conference]] and consequently refused to recognise any obligation for the ACC to be constrained by the [[Potsdam agreement]]. In particular, they resisted all proposals to establish common policies and institutions across Germany as a whole, and anything that they feared might lead to the emergence of an eventual unified German government&lt;ref name="Ziemke 1990 114"&gt;{{cite book|last= Ziemke| first = Earl Frederick| title = The US Army and the Occupation of Germany 1944-1946| publisher = Center of Military History, United States Army| date = 1990| pages = 345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperation within the ACC finally broke down completely when the Soviet representative withdrew on March 20, 1948. After that date, the ACC did not meet again, and the stage was set for the [[Partition (politics)|partition]] of Germany into two states.

After the breakdown of the ACC, the British, French and United States of America occupation zones and the British, French and United States of America zones in Berlin were governed by the '''[[Allied High Commission]]''' with membership from Britain, France, and the United States, whilst the Soviet Zone and Soviet Zone of Berlin were governed by the Chairman of the Soviet Control Commission, later the Soviet High Commissioner. The role of the High Commissioners ceased when the three western zones (other than Berlin) and the Soviet Zone (other than in Berlin) acquired ''de facto'' [[sovereignty]] as respectively the Federal Republic of Germany ('[[West Germany]]') and the [[German Democratic Republic]] ('[[East Germany]]') (subject to certain restrictions).
 
The ACC convened again in 1971, leading to agreement on transit arrangements in Berlin. During the talks for [[German reunification|unification]] of Germany in late 1989, it was decided to convene the ACC again as a forum for solving the issue of [[Allied rights and privileges]] in Germany. The disbanding of the ACC was officially announced by the [[Two Plus Four Agreement]] of September 12, 1990, effective as of March 15, 1991. The ACC last met on 2 October 1990, on the eve of German Reunification.

==Austria==

The creation of an Allied Commission for Austria was envisaged by Allied leaders at the various sessions of the [[European Advisory Commission]] in 1944. The matter became more pressing following the Soviet takeover of Vienna from German control on April 13, 1945. The Soviet authorities in Vienna decided to establish a new Austrian government without prior consultation with the other Allied leaders, and on April 27, the Austrian socialist leader [[Karl Renner]] formed a government in Vienna. The British, US and French governments refused at first to recognize the Renner government, and in order to undermine the Soviet move decided to start right away with the proceedings to establish a joint commission for Austria. However, the Soviet government withheld permission for Allied representatives to enter Vienna during late April to early May, arguing that agreement on partition of Vienna into four occupation zones must be done prior to the arrival of any other troops thereto.&lt;ref&gt;US Charge d'Affaire in the USSR (George Kennan) to the US Secretary of State (Joseph C. Grew), May 7, 1945, ''Foreign Relations of the United States, 1945'', vol. III, pp. 116-117&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it was only on June 4 that a delegation of US, British and French generals was able to arrive at Vienna to survey conditions in the area. However, not much progress was made throughout June, as the Soviet authorities restricted the movement of the western Allies in and around Vienna. Throughout June, negotiations for agreement on division of Austria into occupation zones were held in London within the European Advisory Commission, and the agreement was concluded on July 4, 1945, subject to further approval. The agreement was then approved by the four Allied governments. On July 12, it was approved by the British and French governments. On July 21, the Soviet government gave its approval, and the US government followed suit on July 24.
On June 27, 1945, shortly prior to the formation of the Allied Commission for Austria, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff issued an ordinance authorizing General [[Mark W. Clark]] as Commander in Chief of US Forces of Occupation in Austria. Regarding the future commission for Austria, the directive stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As such you will serve as United States member of the Allied Council of the Allied Commission for Austria and will also be responsible for the administration of military government in the zone or zones assigned to the United States for purposes of occupation and administration.&lt;ref&gt;text in ''Department of State Bulletin'', October 28, 1945, pp. 661-673&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Allied Commission for Austria was established by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060507161359/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/waust01.htm Agreement on control machinery in Austria], signed in the [[European Advisory Commission]] in London on July 4, 1945.  It entered into force on July 24, 1945 on the day that the United States gave notification of approval, the last of the four powers to do so. It was supplemented by an agreement of June 28, 1946, which enabled the Austrian government to conduct foreign relations.

A separate agreement for the division of the city of [[Vienna]] into four occupation zones was concluded on July 9, 1945. This agreement was approved by the British government on July 12, the French government on July 16, the Soviet government on July 21 and the US government on July 24.

Austria was divided into 4 Zones:  American, British, French and Soviet. Vienna, being the capital, was similarly divided but at its centre was an International Zone, sovereignty of which alternated at regular intervals between the 4 Powers. The commission had its seat in Vienna.

A problem faced by the commission was the issue of the provisional government under [[Karl Renner]], which was established unilaterally by the Soviet government in early May 1945. The other Allied governments refused at first to recognize it, but on October 1, 1945, the commission made the following recommendation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Council examined the question of the Provisional Austrian Government and are making recommendations to their respective governments.

The Council decided on the reestablishment of a free press in the whole of Austria subject only to conditions of military security. They also decided that effective December 1 the wearing of military uniforms unless dyed a color other than grey or khaki is forbidden to former personnel of the German Army and to Austrian civilians.&lt;ref&gt;text in ''Department of State Bulletin'', October 21, 1945, p. 612&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The commission recommended to recognize Renner's government, in exchange for introduction of freedom of the press and holding free elections.

The commission for Austria was dismantled following the conclusion of the [[Austrian State Treaty]] on May 15, 1955.

==Japan==
It was agreed at the [[Moscow Conference (1945)|Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers]], and made public in communique issued at the end of the conference on December 27, 1945 that the [[Far Eastern Advisory Commission]] (FEAC) would become the [[Far Eastern Commission]] (FEC), it would be based in Washington, and would oversee the [[Allied Council for Japan]]. This arrangement was similar to those that the Allies had set up for overseeing the defeated Axis powers in Europe. In a mirror image of those Axis countries, like Hungary, which fell to the Soviet Union and were occupied by the Red Army alone, Japan having fallen to the United States and occupied by the U.S. Army, the United States was given the dominant position on the Tokyo-based Allied Council for Japan. The change in name of the FEAC to FEC was significant because as the U.S. Secretary of State [[James F. Byrnes]] reported after the Conference "''As early as August 9 we invited the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and China to join with us in carrying out the objectives of the [[Potsdam Declaration]] and the [[Terms of Surrender for Japan]]. The Far Eastern Advisory Commission was established in October, but Great Britain had reservations regarding its advisory character, and the Soviet Union requested a decision regarding control machinery in Tokyo before joining the work of the Commission.''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/decade/decade19.htm Interim Meeting of Foreign Ministers, Moscow: Report by Secretary Byrnes, December 30, 1945, on Moscow Meeting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230174610/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/decade/decade19.htm |date=December 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/e/shiryo/01/019shoshi.html US proposals for The Far Eastern Advisory Commission Terms of Reference (SWNCC 65/7)] August 21, 1945&lt;/ref&gt; As agreed in the communique the FEC and the Allied Council were dismantled following the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] on September 8, 1951.

An '''Amerasian''' originally meant a person born in [[Asia]] to an [[Asian people|Asian]] mother and a [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Amerasian|title=Definition of AMERASIAN|website=Merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/amerasian|title=the definition of amerasian|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several countries have significant populations of Amerasians in [[Japan]], [[Thailand]], [[South Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]] and, most notably, the [[Philippines]], the last having had the largest [[List of United States military bases#Overseas|US air and naval bases]] outside the [[US mainland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/explainer-how-can-you-be-half-american-and-still-not-a-citizen/|title=Explainer: How Can You Be Half-American and Still Not a Citizen? - Blog - Independent Lens - PBS|website=Pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The term was coined by writer [[Pearl S. Buck]] and was formalized by the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]]. Many people were born to Asian women and U.S. servicemen during [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. The official definition of Amerasian came about as a result of Public Law 97-359, enacted by the [[97th Congress]] of the United States on October 22, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{USPL|97|359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Department of Justice]] and the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS), an Amerasian is: "[A]n alien who was born in [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], [[Kampuchea]] or [[Thailand]] after December 31, 1950 and before October 22, 1982 and was fathered by a U.S. citizen."&lt;ref&gt;from instructions for INS Form 360, ''Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er) or Special Immigrant''&lt;/ref&gt; The Amerasian Foundation (AF) and Amerasian Family Finder (AFF) define an Amerasian as "Any person who was fathered by a citizen of the United States (an American servicemen, American [[expatriate]] or U.S. Government Employee (Regular or Contract)) and whose mother is or was, an Asian National Asian."&lt;ref&gt;[https://amerasianfoundation.org/amerasian-definition/ Amerasian Foundation - Giving Amerasians a Voice » Amerasian Definition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] Retrieved 30 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is commonly applied to half [[Japanese people|Japanese]] children fathered by a U.S. serviceman in [[Japan]], as well as half [[Koreans|Korean]] children fathered by veterans of the [[Korean War]] or stationary soldiers in South Korea. The term is also applied to children of [[Filipinos]] and American rulers during the [[History of the Philippines (1898-1946)#U.S. Territory .281901–1935.29|U.S. colonial period of the Philippines]] (still used until today) and children of [[Thai people|Thais]] and U.S. soldiers during [[World War II]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. The U.S. had bases in Thailand during the Vietnam War.

Amerasian should not be interpreted as a fixed racial term relating to a specific mixture of races (such as [[Mestizo]], [[Mulatto]], [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] or [[Afro-Asians|Afro-Asian]]). The racial strain of the American parent of one Amerasian may be different from that of another Amerasian; it may be [[White Americans|White]], [[African Americans|Black]], [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] or even [[Asian Americans|Asian]]. In the latter case, it is conceivable that the Amerasian could be fathered by a person who shares the same racial background but not the same nationality.

In certain cases, it could apply to the offspring of American females, who engaged in professions such as military nurse, and Asian males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Women-War-Military-Vietnam-Caregiving/dp/0812213173|title=Women at War: The Story of Fifty Military Nurses Who Served in Vietnam|date=1 August 1990|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed-race children, whatever the occupations of their parents, have suffered [[social stigma]].

In April 1975, [[Operation Babylift]] was initiated in South Vietnam to relocate Vietnamese children, many orphans and those of mixed American-Vietnamese parentage (mostly Vietnamese mother and American serviceman father), to the United States and finding American families who would take them in. Over three thousand Amerasians were evacuated from South Vietnam; however, more than twenty thousand Amerasians remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gowen |first=Annie |work=Washington Post |date=18 April 2015 |title=40 years after the fall of Saigon, Americans' children are still left behind |url=http://www.stripes.com/40-years-after-the-fall-of-saigon-americans-children-are-still-left-behind-1.340955 |newspaper=Stars and Stripes |access-date=19 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philippines==
Since 1898, when the United States [[Spanish–American War#Aftermath|annexed the Philippines]] from Spain, there were as many as 21 U.S. bases and 100,000 U.S. military personnel stationed there. The bases closed in 1992 leaving behind thousands of Amerasian children.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3693/is_199710/ai_n8759139|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|website=findarticles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 52,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://newamericamedia.org/2012/05/filipino-amerasians-forge-a-sense-of-belonging-in-the-us.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309161917/http://newamericamedia.org/2012/05/filipino-amerasians-forge-a-sense-of-belonging-in-the-us.php |archive-date=2017-03-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amerasians in the Philippines, but an academic research paper presented in the U.S. (in 2012) by an Angeles, Pampanga, Philippines Amerasian college research study unit suggests that the number could be a lot more, possibly reaching 250,000.&lt;ref name="time-2001-04-16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,106430,00.html |title=The Forgotten Angels |accessdate=2007-06-20 |last=Beech |first=Hannah |date=2001-04-16 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher=Time Inc. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123175954/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C106430%2C00.html |archivedate=2007-01-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike their counterparts in other countries, American-Asians, or Amerasians, in the Philippines remain impoverished and neglected. A study done by the University of the Philippines' Center for Women Studies further found that many Amerasians have experienced some form of abuse and even [[domestic violence]]. The findings cited cases of racial, gender and class discrimination that Amerasian children and youth suffer from strangers, peers, classmates and teachers. The study also said black Amerasians seem to suffer more from racial and class discrimination than their white counterparts.

Two-thirds are raised by single mothers, others by relatives and non-relatives; six percent live on their own or in institution, and 90 percent were born out of wedlock.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt; It was reported in 1993 that prostitutes are increasingly Amerasian, children of prostitutes caught in a cycle that transcends generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://feminism.eserver.org/prostitution.txt Feminism and Women's Studies: Prostitution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070722135606/http://feminism.eserver.org/prostitution.txt |date=2007-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Amerasian Day==
March 4 has been designated as Amerasian Day in the Philippines. The Amerasian Foundation has designated it as International Amerasian Day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://amerasianfoundation.org/amerasian-day/ International Amerasian Day]  Retrieved 30 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal action==
In 1982, the U.S. passed the [[Amerasian Immigration Act]], giving [[Immigration to the United States|preferential immigration status]] to Amerasian children born during the [[Vietnam Conflict]].&lt;ref name="Guardian31DEC2012" /&gt; The act did not apply to Ameriasians born in the Philippines, who can only become United States citizens if their father claims them; most do not.&lt;ref name="Guardian31DEC2012"&gt;{{cite news |title=Filipinos fathered by US soldiers fight for justice |author=Sunshine Lichauco de Leon |location=Manila |url=http://m.guardiannews.com/world/2012/dec/31/amerasians-philippines-american-army |newspaper=The Guardian |date=31 December 2012 |accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A class action suit was filed in 1993 on their behalf in the International Court of Complaints in Washington, DC, to establish Filipino American children's rights to assistance. The court denied the claim, ruling that the children were the products of unmarried women who provided sexual services to U.S. service personnel in the [[List of United States military bases|Philippines]] and were therefore engaged in illicit acts of [[prostitution]]. Such illegal activity could not be the basis for any legal claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpcabrisbane.org/Kasama/2005/V19n3/LifeOfStreetChildren.htm|title=The Life of Street Children in the Philippines and Initiatives to Help Them|last=|first=|date=|website=cpcabrisbane.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aral smallpox incident''' was a July 30, 1971 outbreak of the [[smallpox|viral disease]] which occurred as a result of a field test at a Soviet [[biological weapon]]s (BW) facility on an island in the [[Aral Sea]]. The incident sickened ten people, of whom 3 died, and came to widespread public notice only in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Broad, W.J. and Miller J. (2002), "Traces of Terror: The Bioterror Threat; Report Provides New Details of Soviet Smallpox Accident", ''[[The New York Times]]''; 15 June issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1954, an existing biological weapons test site originally constructed on [[Vozrozhdeniya Island]] in the [[Aral Sea]] in 1948 was greatly expanded by the [[Ministry of Defence (Soviet Union)|Soviet Ministry of Defence]], including to the neighboring [[Komsomolskiy Island]], and named '''Aralsk-7'''.&lt;ref&gt;Dembek, Zygmunt F., Julie A. Pavlin, and Mark G. Kortepeter (2007), "Epidemiology of Biowarfare and Bioterrorism", Chapter 3 of: [http://www.bordeninstitute.army.mil/published_volumes/biological_warfare/biological.html Dembek, Zygmunt F. (2007), ''Medical Aspects of Biological Warfare''], (Series: [[Textbook of Military Medicine|Textbooks of Military Medicine]]), [[Washington, DC]]: The [[Borden Institute]], pp 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt; A field scientific research laboratory to conduct biological experiments was expanded, and the town of Kantubek was constructed to house employees and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Zelicoff, A.P. (2002), "An epidemiological analysis of the 1971 smallpox outbreak in Aralsk, Kazakhstan", In: Tucker, J.B. and R.A. Zilinskas,eds., ''[http://cns.miis.edu/opapers/op9/op9.pdf The 1971 Smallpox Epidemic in Aralsk, Kazakhstan, and the Soviet Biological Warfare Program]''; [[Monterey, California]]: [[Monterey Institute of International Studies]], Center for Nonproliferation Studies. Occasional Paper No. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bio-agent]]s tested there included ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'', ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'', ''[[Brucella suis]]'', ''[[Rickettsia prowazekii]]'', ''[[Variola major]]'' (smallpox), ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', [[botulinum toxin]], and [[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bozheyeva, G., Y. Kunakbayev and D. Yeleukenov (1999), ''Former Soviet Biological Weapons Facilities in Kazakhstan: Past, Present and Future''; Monterey, Calif: Monterey Institute of International Studies, Center for Nonproliferation Studies; Occasional Paper 1.&lt;/ref&gt; (By 1960, the [[Soviet biological weapons program]] also included numerous other research and operational facilities throughout the country.) Aralsk-7 had a history of association with [[fish kill|mass deaths of fish]], various regional plague outbreaks, a [[saiga antelope]] die-off, and individual cases of infectious disease among visitors to Vozrozhdeniya Island.&lt;ref&gt;Bozheyeva, ''[[Op. cit.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Soviet Union ceased to exist, the island became joint territory of [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Uzbekistan]].

==The incident==
According to Soviet General [[Pyotr Burgasov]] (Peter Burgasov), field testing of 400 grams of smallpox at Aralsk-7 caused an outbreak on 30 July 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Broad, ''Op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Burgasov, former Chief Sanitary Physician of the [[Soviet Army]], former Soviet Vice-Minister of Health and a senior researcher within the Soviet BW program, described the incident:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On Vozrozhdeniya Island in the Aral Sea, the strongest recipes of smallpox were tested. Suddenly I was informed that there were mysterious cases of mortalities in [[Aral, Kazakhstan|Aralsk (Aral)]]. A research ship [the ''Lev Berg''] of the Aral fleet came to within 15 km of the island (it was forbidden to come any closer than 40&amp;nbsp;km). The lab technician of this ship took samples of plankton twice a day from the top deck. The smallpox formulation—400 gr. of which was exploded on the island—"got her" and she became infected. After returning home to Aralsk, she infected several people including children. All of them died. I suspected the reason for this and called the Chief of General Staff of Ministry of Defense and requested to forbid the stop of the [[Alma-Ata]]-[[Moscow]] train in Aralsk. As a result, the epidemic around the country was prevented. I called [future [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet General Secretary]] Yuri] [[Yuri Andropov|Andropov]], who at that time was Chief of KGB, and informed him of the exclusive recipe of smallpox obtained on Vozrazhdenie Island.&lt;ref name="Shoham"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shoham D, Wolfson Z |title=The Russian biological weapons program: vanished or disappeared? |journal=Crit.

There is a contending belief that the disease actually spread to the ''Lev Berg'' from [[Uyaly]] or [[Komsomolsk-on-Ustyurt]], two cities in what is now Uzbekistan where the ship docked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Enserink M |title=Biowarfare. Did bioweapons test cause a deadly smallpox outbreak? |journal=Science |volume=296 |issue=5576 |pages=2116–7 |year=2002 |pmid=12077372 |doi=10.1126/science.296.5576.2116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last2=Bellomo|first2=Michael|last1=Zelicoff|first1=Alan P.|title=Microbe: Are We Ready for the Next Plague?|year=2005|publisher=American Management Association|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8144-0865-0|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident caused ten individuals to contract smallpox and three unvaccinated individuals (a woman and two children) died from the haemorrhagic form of the disease. One crew member of the ''Lev Berg'' contracted smallpox as the ship passed within 15 km (9 miles) of the island. This crew member became ill on 6 August with fever, headache, and [[myalgia]]. The ship then landed in the port city of Aral on 11 August. The ill crew member returned to her home, and she developed a cough and temperature exceeding 38.9°C (102°F). Her physician prescribed [[antibiotic]]s and [[aspirin]]. Although she was previously vaccinated for smallpox, a rash subsequently appeared on her back, face, and scalp; her fever subsided; and she recovered by 15 August. On 27 August this patient's 9-year-old brother developed a rash and fever, his pediatrician prescribed [[tetracycline]] and aspirin, and he recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Zelicoff (2002), ''Op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the following 3 weeks, eight additional cases of fever and rash occurred in Aral. Five adults ranging in age from 23 to 60, and three children (4 and 9 months old, and a 5-year-old) were diagnosed with smallpox both clinically and by laboratory testing. These children and the 23-year-old were previously unvaccinated. The two youngest children and the 23-year-old subsequently developed the haemorrhagic form of smallpox and died. The remaining individuals had previously been vaccinated, and all recovered after having an attenuated form of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Zelicoff (2002), ''Op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The high ratio of haemorrhagic smallpox cases in this outbreak, combined with the rate of infectivity and the testimony of General Burgasov, has led to the understanding that an enhanced weaponized strain of smallpox virus was released from Aralsk-7 in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Zelicoff (2002), ''Op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dembek, ''Op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
A massive public health response to the smallpox cases in Aral ensued once the disease was recognized. In less than 2 weeks, approximately 50,000 residents of Aral were vaccinated. Household quarantine of potentially exposed individuals was enacted, and hundreds were isolated in a makeshift facility at the edge of the city. All traffic in and out of the city was stopped, and approximately 5.000 sq. meter (54.000 sq. ft.) of living space and 18 metric tons of household goods were decontaminated by health officials.&lt;ref&gt;Zelicoff (2002), ''Op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Presidential elections''' were held in [[Azerbaijan]] on 9 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.apa.az/xeber_central_election_commission_declares_aze_197152.html |title=Central Election Commission declares Azerbaijani presidential elections will be held on October 9|work= Azerbaijan Business Centre|date= 14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a victory for incumbent President [[Ilham Aliyev]], who received 84.5% of the vote, whilst leading [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] candidate [[Jamil Hasanli]] finished second with 5.5% of the vote.

The election was marred by claims of irregularities; official results were accidentally released by the government's Central Election Commission through a [[mobile app]] before voting began, giving incumbent Aliyev a victory with 72.38% of the vote.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/10/09/oops-azerbaijan-released-election-results-before-voting-had-even-started/|title=Oops: Azerbaijan released election results before voting had even started|publisher=''The Washington Post''|last=Fisher |first=Max|date=October 9, 2013|accessdate=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission later recalled the results, claiming that they were taken from the [[Azerbaijani presidential election, 2008|2008 elections]].&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; This claim has been disputed, given that the results accidentally released included the candidates from the 2013 elections,&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; and that the percentages differed from the 2008 results.

[[OSCE]] monitors reported candidate and voter intimidation and a restrictive media environment, including arrests and the use of force against journalists and activists. 92% of the coverage on the six main TV channels were dedicated to the incumbent president.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE/ODIHR Final Report on Azerbaijan Presidential election, 24 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
All previous elections in Azerbaijan observed by [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] fell short of meeting international standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Azerbaijan to Move against International Organizations?|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/66701|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=Eurasianet|date=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 an amendment was made to the [[Azerbaijani constitutional referendum, 2009|Constitution of Azerbaijan]], which abolished the limit of two consecutive presidential terms and allowed incumbent Aliyev, who had already served for two terms, to run for president for unlimited number of times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanforum.net/news/549/|title=Controversial constitutional referendum in Azerbaijan passed, 19 Mar 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitutional amendment was condemned by the [[Venice Commission]] of the Council of Europe, which stated that "the abolition of existing limits preventing the unlimited re-election of a President is a step back, in terms of democratic achievements".&lt;ref&gt;
[http://azerireport.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1110 Venice Commission Questions Constitutional Changes In Azerbaijan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=CDL-AD(2009)010-e|title=Venice Commission :: Council of Europe|website=www.venice.coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment was also criticized by the Azerbaijani opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwpr.net/report-news/opposition-condemns-changes-azeri-constitution|title=Opposition Condemns Changes to Azeri Constitution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of the amendment in 2013 Ilham Aliyev ran for president for the third time.

After his visit to Azerbaijan the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Jean-Claude Mignon called on the authorities to fully respect their obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PACE President: Elections in Azerbaijan Must Fully Comply with European Standards|url=http://contact.az/docs/2013/Politics/052900037950en.htm#.UcdDHTuG0ks|accessdate=23 June 2013|newspaper=contact.az|date=29 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610210526/http://contact.az/docs/2013/Politics/052900037950en.htm#.UcdDHTuG0ks|archive-date=2015-06-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, overall, in 2013 elections the Central Election Commission (CEC) demonstrated efficiency in administrative preparations for the elections and observed the legal deadlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/institutions/110015?download=true|title=OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation Mission Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2013 the [[New Azerbaijan Party]] nominated incumbent President [[Ilham Aliyev]] as their official presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Fifth Congress of the "Yeni Azerbaijan Party" nominated Chairman of the Party and President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev to stand in the presidential election in October 2013|url=http://en.president.az/articles/8393|accessdate=11 June 2013|date=7 June 2013|agency=Official website of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Azerbaijani Ruling Party Nominates Aliyev For Presidency|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/azerbaijan-aliyev-nominated-president/25010042.html|accessdate=11 June 2013|date=7 June 2013|agency=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; MP Mubariz Gurbanli announced that according to the Election Code of Azerbaijan Republic, the party had not only filled its signature requirements but could get more than the minimum 40,000 required signatures. He said: "The signature lists have been ready for already 4-5 days, but they can be submitted to the Central Election Commission starting from 20 August, that is, 50 days before the elections under the legislation. So, our employees will submit the signature lists to CEC tomorrow. Under the law, the CEC will issue a document confirming the candidate’s participation in the elections after it reviews them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.az/articles/politics/81865|title=News.Az -   Ruling party submits Aliyev’s documents to CEC|website=www.news.az}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, playwright [[Rustam Ibragimbekov]] was chosen as the leader of the newly created National Council of Democratic Forces. The NCDF brought together main opposition forces, including [[Musavat]], the [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party]], Open Society, Forum of Intellectuals.

==Conduct==
An official [[smartphone app]] run by the Central Election Commission inadvertently released final election results a day before polls had opened. The results showed [[Ilham Aliyev]] having won with 72.76% of the recorded votes, while the nearest opposing candidate, [[Jamil Hasanli]], tallied just 7.4%. The data was recalled, with an official claim that the app's developer had mistakenly tested the app with the 2008 election results, but the data released did not match the voter totals nor percentages of the previous election.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/azerbaijan-releases-election-results-before-the-polls-even-open-8869732.html |title=Azerbaijan Releases Election Results...

;States
*{{Flag|United States}} — The State Department said that the election "fell short of international standards." The statement, which aligned with the position of the OSCE/ODIHR, also named the procedural irregularities such as 1) ballot box stuffing; 2) serious problems with vote counting; and 3) failure to record the number of received ballots. "Leading up to election day, the Government of Azerbaijan also maintained a repressive political environment.

Azerbaijani officials have bashed those who criticizes their elections.

===International scandal===

The controversial assessments by the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]]/[[European Parliament]] and [[Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights|OSCE/ODIHR]] sparked a major scandal, as for the first time the reports of these authoritative European organizations openly contradicted one other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Regions-and-countries/Azerbaijan/Europe-Azerbaijan-and-caviar-144030|title=Europe, Azerbaijan, and caviar|first=Osservatorio Balcani e|last=Caucaso|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, many European experts and parliamentarians, among them also deputies of the [[European Parliament]], harshly criticized the reports of the European Parliament and PACE as being biased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24573024 |title=European MPs' praise for Azerbaijan election sparks row|work= BBC News|date= 17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://euobserver.com/opinion/121803 |title=MEPs' shameful support for the Azerbaijan election|work= [[EU Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama.am/en/analytics/2013/10/16/a-gross/ |first=Andreas|last= Gross|title= Azerbaijan with regressing democracy is patient placed in reanimation ward at Council of Europe|work= www.panorama.am|date= 25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greens-efa.eu/azerbaijan-elections-10744.html|title=Azerbaijan elections|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has distanced itself from the words of the observer mission EP / PACE, stating that the differences between the findings of the delegation of parliamentarians and the OSCE are so far away that it cannot be supported at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistsanddemocrats.eu/newsroom/statement-european-parliament-election-observation-mission-azerbaijan|title=Statement on the European Parliament election observation mission to Azerbaijan - Socialists &amp; Democrats|website=www.socialistsanddemocrats.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greens/EFA Group of the European Parliament said that they do not endorse the statements made by the EP delegation. The Green foreign affairs spokesperson Werner Schulz said, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The shortcomings of EP's own election observation mission to Azerbaijan call into question the existence of such short-term missions in general...
The European Parliament loses credibility with statements ignoring the reality of the situation in the country. A handful of MEPs are endangering the European Parliament's reputation in fighting for human rights, democracy and rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24573024|title=European furore over Azeri election|first=Laurence|last=Peter|date=17 October 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
[[European Stability Initiative]] (ESI) think tank has published a detailed report on observation missions participating in Azerbaijani elections 2013 titled "Disgraced: Azerbaijan and the end of election monitoring as we know it".

==Aftermath==
On 12 October around 4,000 people protested against the election results.

The '''Big Three''' were a trio of professional basketball players - [[LeBron James]], [[Dwyane Wade]], and [[Chris Bosh]] - who played for the [[Miami Heat]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) from 2010 to 2014. All three players were selected within the first five picks of the [[2003 NBA draft]], and became [[List of National Basketball Association franchise career scoring leaders|scoring leaders]] for their respective franchises over their first seven seasons.

After re-signing Wade following the [[2009–10 NBA season|2009–10 season]], the Heat secured the signings of both Bosh and James in free agency, with the latter being announced in the television special, ''[[The Decision (TV special)|The Decision]]''. The trio led the Heat to the [[NBA Finals]] in each of their four seasons together, and won back-to-back championships in [[2012 NBA Finals|2012]] and [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]]. After losing the Finals the following season, James opted out of a contract extension, and returned to play for the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. Both Wade and Bosh continued to play for the Heat for two additional seasons after James' departure, before Wade departed Miami and signed with the [[Chicago Bulls]], while Bosh left the game due to medical reasons. On September 27th, 2017, Wade signed a one-year contract with the Cavaliers, reuniting him with James.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/20839399/dwyane-wade-clears-waivers-signs-cleveland-cavaliers&lt;/ref&gt; On February 8, 2018, at the NBA trade deadline, the Cavaliers traded back Wade to the Miami Heat in exchange for a protected 2024 second-round draft pick. Beginning in the 2019-2020 NBA season, LeBron will be the last remaining active member from the Heat Big 3, as on September 16, 2018, Wade announced he’ll retire from the NBA after the [[2018-19 NBA season|2018-19 season]].

The trio have been credited for helping to revolutionize the NBA, with many more teams seeking to adopt the "Big Three" model of courting established NBA superstars to their franchises, in order to win championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Friel|first=Jon|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1307752-how-miami-heat-big-three-blueprint-changed-the-nba|title=How the Miami Heat 'Big 3' Blueprint Changed the NBA|work=BleacherReport.com|date=August 23, 2012|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blood in the Snow Canadian Film Festival (BITS)''' was first founded by Kelly Micheal Stewart in 2012 as an offshoot of his then ongoing monthly film series entitled "Fright Nights at the Projection Booth" which were held at the former Projection Booth theater in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. With a considerable amount of Canadian films all vying for a spot in the showcase, Stewart decided to put together the first edition of what would become a yearly film festival that replaced the monthly series. After a first edition entitled "Fright Nights :Blood in the Snow Canadian Film Festival weekend", Stewart shortened the name and re-imagined the construct of the festival, bringing on a programming team and sharpening its focus with the aim of promoting, spotlighting and helping to develop the independent contemporary genre filmmaking community across Canada. The festival has branched off in its efforts to become visible all year round with a public access television interview show and a podcast.

==Festival History==

===2012===

The first year of the festival began as spinoff of the monthly film night hosted and programmed by Kelly Michael Stewart called Fright Nights at the Projection Booth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://entertainmentmaven.com/2012/07/02/henry-rollins-wants-you-grindhouse-edition-of-fright-nights-at-the-projection-booth/|title=Henry Rollins Wants You! – Grindhouse Edition of Fright Nights at the Projection Booth|first=|last=entertainmentmaven|date=2 July 2012|work=entertainmentmaven.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program that year included 6 feature films and 13 shorts, including the first iteration of the festival's popular "Short Film Showcase" in the form of a "best of 2012 shorts" programming block and a midnight film on the Saturday night of the festival. Running from November 30 to December 2, 2012, titles that year included the World Premieres of [[Sick: Survive the Night]] and In The House of Flies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodinthesnow.ca/BITS2012.html|title=The Blood In The Snow Canadian Film Festival|work=bloodinthesnow.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with screenings of Beyond The Black Rainbow, Devil's Night,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://entertainmentmaven.com/2012/12/07/blood-in-the-snow-film-festival-2012-devils-night-review/|title=Blood In The Snow Film Festival 2012: Devil’s Night Review (Kirk Haviland)|first=|last=moviejunkieto|date=7 December 2012|work=entertainmentmaven.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famine and the Canadian Premiere of Blood for Irina.

===2013===

2013 marked the first year the festival utilized a traditional festival submission layout with the introduction of a full programming team. The 2nd edition of the festival introduced other changes including a move to the Carlton Cinemas, running November 29 to December 1, 2013. The festival fine-tuned its prime-time shorts program and promptly sold out the screening, held a preview screening event to introduce their new surroundings on October 10 featuring the World Premiere of The Basement, started an interactive media day for press and filmmakers and created a vendor village of genre-themed merchants in the lobby. The lineup included 7 feature films and 16 shorts Films that year included [[Evangeline (2013 film)|Evangeline]], Thanatomorphose, Ghostkeepers, Blood Riders: The Devil Rides with us, Clean Break, Criminal and Discopath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodinthesnow.ca/BITS2013.html|title=The Blood In The Snow Canadian Film Festival|work=bloodinthesnow.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014===

2014 saw the return of many of the initiatives from 2013 but added upon them. The lineup expanded to 8 features along with 15 shorts, and included the first educational Industry Panel from the festival, furthering its commitment to the genre community. In a first for the festival, multiple second screenings (running concurrently to the original schedule on a 2nd screen) had to be added due to ticket demand.Continuing at the Carlton in its third year on November 28 to 30, 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horrorinthehammer.ca/2014/11/blood-in-snow-canadian-film-festival.html|title=Blood in the Snow Canadian Film Festival - 2014|work=horrorinthehammer.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; the festival screened the world premieres of Teddy Bomb&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/movies/film-fests-and-screenings/be-very-afraid/|title=Be very afraid of the Blood in the Snow Canadian Film Festival|date=26 November 2014|work=nowtoronto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Heinous Acts along with Canadian and Toronto premieres of Berkshire County, [[Queen of Blood (2014 film)|Queen of Blood]] (starring [[Skinny Puppy]]'s [[Nivek Ogre]]), [[Ejecta (film)|Ejecta]], Bloody Knuckles, [[Black Mountain Side (film)|Black Mountain Side]] and Kingdom Come.

The 4th edition of the festival saw the expansion of the Industry Panels put on by the festival but also saw the shrinking down of the vendor village. The lineup included 8 feature films and 15 shorts and again featured multiple screenings for many films. The 4th edition ran from November 27 to 29, 2015 and hosted the world premieres of Night Cries, Secret Santa and [[White Raven (2015 film)|White Raven]] along with local and Canadian premieres of Farhope Tower,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2015/11/26/blood-in-the-snow-festival-features-canadian-horror-movies.html|title=Blood in the Snow festival features Canadian horror movies - Toronto Star|work=thestar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dark Stranger, Save Yourself, Bite and Larry Kent's controversial She Who Must Burn, which won best picture that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodinthesnow.ca/BITS2015.html|title=The Blood In The Snow Canadian Film Festival|work=bloodinthesnow.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016===

The 2016 festival&lt;ref&gt;http://screenanarchy.com/2016/10/blood-in-the-snow-2016-canadian-genre-festival-announces-lineup.html&lt;/ref&gt; moved to the confines of the Cineplex Odeon Yonge &amp; Dundas Cinemas for its 5th edition. The move – spurred by the ticket sales of previous years – meant moving into a theater screen with more than double the capacity of the previous venue, alleviating the need for repeat screenings and allowing audiences to view the entire program without screening conflicts. The festival also expanded to 4 days from the previous 3, running Nov 24 to Nov 27, 2016. Industry Panels moved to Duke's Refresher bar and the festival ran not one but two midnight screenings, one each both Friday and Saturday night, as the lineup moved to 9 features and 24 shorts. The festival also launched its first DVD compilation of short films entitled "Blood in the Snow presents: Bloody BITS Shorts Compilation" for sale in the lobby of the theater. Films hosted included World Premieres of 3 Dead Trick or Treaters,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skonmovies.com/2016/11/bits-2016-3-dead-trick-or-treaters.html&lt;/ref&gt; Streamer&lt;ref&gt;http://hyemusings.ca/bits-2016-spotlight-streamer-co-director-jared-bratt/&lt;/ref&gt; and Inspiration&lt;ref&gt;http://flickhunter.blogspot.ca/2016/11/bits-16-film-review-inspiration.html&lt;/ref&gt; along with Toronto Premieres of Capture Kill Release,&lt;ref&gt;http://flickhunter.blogspot.ca/2016/11/bits-16-film-review-capture-kill-release.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Sublet,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skonmovies.com/2016/11/bits-2016-sublet.html&lt;/ref&gt; 24 x 36: A Movie about Movie Posters,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thegate.ca/film/027064/5-things-cant-miss-blood-snow-2016/&lt;/ref&gt; Holy Hell,&lt;ref&gt;https://cinemaaxis.com/2016/11/23/bits-2016-holy-hell/&lt;/ref&gt; Kidnap Capital&lt;ref&gt;http://flickhunter.blogspot.ca/2016/11/bits-16-film-review-kidnap-capital.html&lt;/ref&gt; and Best Picture Winner The Unseen.&lt;ref&gt;https://danielgarber.wordpress.com/2016/12/03/out-of-sight-movies-reviewed-the-unseen-castle-in-the-sky/&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017===

The 6th edition of the festival&lt;ref&gt;https://soundcloud.com/horror-happensrs/horror-happens-radio-episode-242-11-14-17&lt;/ref&gt; saw another venue change as BITS moved to it new home at The Royal Cinema. The move meant the elimination of the traditional midnight show that had been part of the programming since year 1, but saw the festival stay at 4 days in length, running Nov 23–Nov 26, 2017. The move also added another 100 seats in capacity for the festival and attendance numbers continued to grow. Industry Panels moved to the local Monarch Tavern and the festival also held its first-ever movie poster gallery show in conjunction with the festival at nearby artspace the Super Wonder Gallery. The lineup showed 9 feature films and 23 shorts and also included formal awards show hosted by Nick Smyth after the completion of the closing gala film. Films hosted included World Premieres of Red Spring&lt;ref&gt;https://www.original-cin.ca/posts/2017/11/22/mve6qxsw7k30vpca76psemyq1x3sps&lt;/ref&gt; and Blood Child&lt;ref&gt;https://anatomyofascream.wordpress.com/2017/11/23/bits-blood-child-2017/&lt;/ref&gt; as well as critical darlings Fake Blood&lt;ref&gt;http://flickhunter.blogspot.ca/2017/11/bits-17-film-review-fake-blood.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.time2kill.ca/reviews/fakeblood&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://intheseats.ca/bits-2017-review-fake-blood/&lt;/ref&gt; and The Child Remains&lt;ref&gt;http://crypticrock.com/child-remains-movie-review/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://nofspodcast.com/blood-snow-review-child-remains-solid-female-centric-ghost-story/&lt;/ref&gt; along with Best Picture winner Buckout Road,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geekchicelite.com/filmtvreviews/movie-review-buckout-road/&lt;/ref&gt; Art of Obsession,&lt;ref&gt;http://cinema-crazed.com/blog/2017/11/26/art-of-obsession-2017-blood-in-the-snow-2017/#more-27003&lt;/ref&gt; Kill Order (aka Meza),&lt;ref&gt;http://screenanarchy.com/2017/11/blood-in-the-snow-2017-review-kill-order.html&lt;/ref&gt; Darken&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skonmovies.com/2017/11/bits-2017-darken.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cp24.com/video?clipId=1267637&lt;/ref&gt; and holiday themed slasher Once Upon a Time at Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;http://influxmagazine.com/once-upon-a-time-at-christmas-2017-review/&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018===

Announced in January 2018, BITS 7th edition will be expanding yet again as the festival will now run 6 days from Nov 22 to Nov 27, 2018 at the Royal Cinema. Film Submissions opened February 1, 2018 on Film Freeway.

==Other Projects==

===Late Night Double Feature===

In 2014, many of the team behind the Blood in the Snow Canadian Film Festival made an anthology film called [[Late Night Double Feature]]. The film project was developed by Festival Director Kelly Michael Stewart and directed by three BITS alumni directors Navin Ramaswaran (One More For The Road), Zach Ramelan (Dead Rush) and Torin Langen (Malleus Maleficarum). The film also features acting roles from Kelly Michael Stewart and BITS Senior Programmers Jason Tannis (who was also an Executive Producer), Kirk Haviland, BITS team members Jen Gorman &amp; R.X. Zammit. To avoid a conflict of interest, the film didn't play BITS and the film had its Canadian Premiere at the 2015 Canadian Film Fest on March 26, 2015 instead.

===BITS TV===

Blood in the Snow started its own spin-off TV series on Bell tv1 in early 2016. This series is free on demand for Bell subscribers on Channel One. This interview style TV series is hosted by Festival Director Kelly Michael Stewart and was shot at the Carlton Cinema (where the festival took place between 2013 and 2015). Its guests for season one included Ryan M. Andrews, [[Brigitte Kingsley]], [[Chris Alexander (editor)|Chris Alexander]], Justin McConnell, Tricia Lee and Christopher Grioux. Season 2 featured a couple/group interview dynamic as opposed to the solo interview style of season 1 with guests including Bea Macapagal and Larica Perera, Greg Kovacs and Darren Hutchings, Gabriel Carrer and Ry Barrett, Cody Calahan and Chad Archbald, Richard Powell and Zach Green, Kat Threlkeld and Lance Fernandes along with Greg and Colette Jeffs. In 2017 it was revealed that Bell would be phasing out Bell TV1 from its cable channel lineup, but BITS TV lives on as a series of pre-show segments played during the festival.

===BITS RADIO===

2017 saw the launch of BITS RADIO, a new interview-based podcast hosted by Robert Bellamy along with rotating co-hosts from the BITS team including Kelly Michael Stewart, Jason Tannis, Kirk Haviland and Carolyn Mauricette. The podcast started with a live launch at the London On-based Shock Stock genre convention and has featured interviews done at Toronto's Horrorama convention after the 2017 lineup announcement as well as interviews done in front of a live audience at the 2017 festival. The podcast remains ongoing.

===Bloody BITS===

In 2016, in conjunction with Black Fawn Distribution (a sub-division of Black Fawn Films), BITS released a shorts compilation containing some of the best shorts from its first 4 years entitled "Blood in the Snow Presents: Bloody BITS Short Compilation". The DVD featured 7 shorts from previous festivals including Dead All Night, Lively, Uncommon Enemies, Greater Than, One More For The Road, Tasha and Friends and Seiren. As of February 2018, a 2nd volume of the compilation is in the works and expected to be ready before the end of the year.

'''George Everette "Bud" Day''' (24 February 1925 – 27 July 2013) was a [[United States Air Force]] Officer, Aviator, and Veteran of World War II, [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]].  He was also a [[prisoner of war]], and recipient of the [[Medal of Honor]] and [[Air Force Cross (United States)|Air Force Cross]]. {{As of|2016}}, he is the only person to be awarded both the Medal of Honor and Air Force Cross. He was posthumously advanced to the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] effective March 27, 2018 as directed by the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act. 

Day's actions from 26 August 1967 through 14 March 1973, were the last to earn the Medal of Honor prior to the [[fall of Saigon|end of U.S. involvement]] in the war on 30 April 1975, though some honorees (e.g. [[Leslie H. Sabo Jr.]], honored on 16 May 2012) were cited for their medals after Day's recognition on 4 March 1976. He is the most decorated United States Military Officer since [[Douglas MacArthur]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Early life and education==
Day was born in [[Sioux City, Iowa]], on 24 February 1925. In 1942 he dropped out of Central High School and enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC).&lt;ref name="VT"&gt;{{cite web|title=George E. Day|url=http://www.veterantributes.org/TributeDetail.php?recordID=16|publisher=VeteranTributes.org|accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Day attended [[Morningside College]] on the [[G.I. Bill]], earning a [[bachelor of science]] degree, followed by law school at the [[University of South Dakota School of Law]], receiving a [[Juris Doctor]]. Day passed the [[bar exam]] in 1949 and was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in [[South Dakota]]. In later life, Day was also awarded a [[Master of Arts]] degree from [[Saint Louis University]], a [[doctor of humane letters]] from Morningside, and a [[doctor of laws]] from [[Troy State University]]. Day was admitted to the [[Florida Bar]] in 1977.

==Military career==
Enlisting in the USMC on 10 December 1942, Day served 30 months in the North Pacific during World War II as a member of a [[5-inch gun]] battery with the [[Marine defense battalions|3rd Defense Battalion]] on [[Johnston Island]], but he never saw combat. He was discharged (the first time) on 24 November 1945.&lt;ref name="VT"/&gt;

On 11 December 1946, Day joined the [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]], serving until 10 December 1949. On 17 May 1950, Day received a direct commission as a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[Iowa Air National Guard]]. He was called to [[active duty]] on 15 March 1951 for [[Air Education and Training Command#Flying training|undergraduate pilot training]] in the [[U.S. Air Force]]. He was awarded his [[Aircrew Badge|pilot wings]] at [[Webb Air Force Base]], [[Texas]], in September 1952, continuing through December 1952 in All-Weather [[Interceptor aircraft|Interceptor]] School and [[Artillery|Gunnery]] School.&lt;ref name="VT"/&gt;

From February 1953 to August 1955 during the [[Korean War]], Day served two tours as a [[fighter-bomber]] [[aviator|pilot]], flying the [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet]] in the [[559th Strategic Fighter Squadron]]. Promoted to [[Captain (United States)|captain]], he decided to make the Air Force a career and was augmented into the Regular Air Force. He was assigned to the [[55th Fighter Squadron|55th Fighter Bomber Squadron]]. He then trained to fly the [[F-100 Super Sabre]] in 1957 while stationed at [[RAF Wethersfield|Royal Air Force Wethersfield]] in the United Kingdom through June 1959. It was during this time that he had to bail out of a jet fighter without a parachute, becoming the first person ever to live through such a feat.&lt;ref name="VT"/&gt; According to Day, a {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} pine tree cushioned his fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/Sections/TVNews/Nightly%20News/photos/bud%20Day%20Article.pdf |title=Col. George "Bud" Day: Siouxland's Hometown Hero |author=Chris McGowan |publisher=Siouxland Lifestyle Magazine |date=2005 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day was assistant professor of aerospace science at the Air Force ROTC detachment at [[Saint Louis University]] in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, from June 1959 to August 1963.&lt;ref name="VT"/&gt;

Anticipating retirement in 1968 and now a major, Day volunteered for a tour in [[South Vietnam]] and was assigned to the [[31st Fighter Wing|31st Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Tuy Hoa Air Base]] in April 1967. At that time, he had more than 5,000 flying hours, with 4,500 of them in fighters. On 25 June 1967, with extensive previous service flying two tours in F-100s, Major Day was made the first commander of Detachment 1, [[416th Tactical Fighter Squadron]], [[37th Training Wing|37th Tactical Fighter Wing]] based at [[Phu Cat Air Base]].&lt;ref name="misty"&gt;{{cite web| last = Nophsker| first = Gary (Misty 128)| url = http://www.mistyvietnam.com/history.html| title = Misty Unofficial History| publisher = MistyVietnam.com| accessdate = September 1, 2009| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091002193334/http://www.mistyvietnam.com/history.html| archivedate = October 2, 2009| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pownetwork.org/bios/d/d051.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the project name ''Commando Sabre'', twin-seat USAF F-100Fs were evaluated as a Fast [[Forward Air Controller]] (Fast FAC) aircraft in high threat areas, given that [[F-4 Phantom II]] aircraft were in high demand for strike and Combat Air Patrol (CAP) roles. Using the call sign ''[[Misty (song)|Misty]]'', the name of Day's favorite song, his detachment of four two-seat F-100Fs and 16 pilots became pioneer "Fast FACs") over [[Laos]] and [[North Vietnam]]. All Misty FAC crews were volunteers with at least 100 combat missions in Vietnam and 1,000 minimum flight hours. Tours in Commando Sabre were temporary and normally limited to four months or about 60 missions.

===Prisoner of war===
On 26 August 1967, Major Day was flying F-100F-15-NA, AF Serial No. 56-3954, call sign Misty 01,&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, Chris, ''Vietnam Air Losses'', Midland Publishing, Hinckley, UK, 2001, {{ISBN|1-85780-115-6}}, page 116.&lt;/ref&gt; on his 26th Fast FAC sortie, directing a flight of [[F-105 Thunderchief]]s in an air strike against a [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) site north of Thon Cam Son&lt;ref&gt;''Vietnam Air Losses'', Chris Hobson, Midland Publishing, Hinckley, UK, c2001, pp. 115–116, {{ISBN|1-85780-115-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and west of [[Đồng Hới]], {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]] in North Vietnam. Day was on his 65th mission into North Vietnam and acting as check pilot for Captain Corwin M. "Kipp" Kippenhan, who was upgrading to aircraft commander. [[37 mm automatic air defense gun M1939 (61-K)|37 mm antiaircraft fire]] crippled the aircraft, forcing the crew to eject. In the ejection, Day's right arm was broken in three places when he struck the side of the cockpit, and he also received eye and back injuries.

Kippenhan was rescued by a USAF [[HH-3E]], but Day was unable to contact the rescue helicopter by survival radio and was quickly captured by North Vietnamese local [[militia]]. On his fifth night, when he was still within 20 miles (32 kilometers) of the DMZ, Day escaped from his initial captors despite his serious injuries. Although stripped of both his boots and [[flight suit]], Day crossed the DMZ back into South Vietnam. Within 2 miles (3 kilometers) of the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] [[fire support base|firebase]] at [[Con Thien]] and after 12 to 15 days of evading, he was captured again, this time by a [[Viet Cong]] patrol that wounded him in the leg and hand with gunfire.

Taken back to his original camp, Day was tortured for escaping, breaking his right arm again. He then was moved to several prison camps near [[Hanoi]], where he was periodically beaten, starved, and tortured. In December 1967, Day shared a cell with Navy [[Lt. Cdr.]] and future senator and presidential candidate [[John McCain]]. Air Force major Norris Overly nursed both back to health, and McCain later devised a makeshift splint of bamboo and rags that helped heal Day's seriously atrophied arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert D.|last=Kaplan |authorlink=Robert D. Kaplan |title=Rereading Vietnam |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200708u/kaplan-vietnam |work=[[The Atlantic Monthly]] |publisher= |date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |accessdate=October 5, 2010 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200708u/kaplan-vietnam |title=Rereading Vietnam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March 1973, Day was released after five years and seven months as a North Vietnamese prisoner. Within three days Day was reunited with his wife, Doris Sorensen Day, and four children at [[March Air Reserve Base|March Air Force Base]], California. On 4 March 1976, President [[Gerald Ford]] awarded Day the Medal of Honor for his personal bravery while a captive in North Vietnam.

Day had been promoted to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] while a prisoner, and he decided to remain in the Air Force in hopes of being promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]. Although initially too weak to resume operational flying, he spent a year in physical rehabilitation and with 13 separate medical waivers, he was returned to active flying status. He underwent conversion training to the [[F-4 Phantom II]] and was appointed vice commander of the [[33d Fighter Wing|33rd Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], Florida.

Day, in 2008, said of his imprisonment, "As awful as it sounds, no one could say we did not do well. ...[Being a POW] was a major issue in my life and one that I am extremely proud of. I was just living day to day. One bad cold and I would have been dead."&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite news|last=[[USA Today]]|title=Medal of Honor recipient Bud Day, McCain's cellmate, dies |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/07/28/bud-day-vietnam-mccain/2593839/|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|accessdate=29 July 2013|date=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement===
After being passed over for nomination to brigadier general, Day retired from active duty in 1977 to resume practicing law in Florida. At his retirement he had nearly 8,000 total flying hours, 4,900 in single-engine jets, and had flown the [[F-80 Shooting Star]], F-84 Thunderjet, F-100 Super Sabre, [[F-101 Voodoo]], [[F-104 Starfighter]], [[F-105 Thunderchief]], [[F-106 Delta Dart]], [[F-4 Phantom II]], [[A-4 Skyhawk]], [[A-7 Corsair II]], [[Northrop F-5|CF-5 Tiger]], and [[F-15 Eagle]] jet fighters.

Following his retirement, Day wrote an autobiographical account of his experiences as a prisoner of war, ''Return with Honor'', followed by ''Duty, Honor, Country'', which updated his autobiography to include his post–Air Force years. Among other endeavors, in 1996 Day filed a [[class action lawsuit]] for [[breach of contract]] against the United States government on behalf of military retirees who were stripped of their military medical care benefits at age 65 and told to apply for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. Although winning the case in the district court in 2001, the judgment against the U.S. was overturned by the [[United States courts of appeals|U.S. Court of Appeals]] in 2002. Congress later redressed this situation by establishing the TRICARE for Life (TFL) program, which restored [[Tricare|TRICARE]] military medical benefits for career military retirees over the age of 65, making the retirees eligible for both programs with Medicare as the primary payer and TRICARE as the secondary payer.

===Posthumous Advancement of Rank===
Col George "Bud" day was posthumously advanced to the rank of brigadier general during a Heritage to Horizons summer concert series at the Air Force Memorial in Arlington, Virginia, June 8, 2018. The ceremony was presided over by the Chief of the Staff of the Air Force, General [[David L. Goldfein]], and attended by his widow, Mrs. Doris Day. The posthumous advancement of Day was introduced by former prisoner of war cell mate and current Senator [[John McCain]] and was directed by the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act. The rank advancement was effective March 27, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Secretary of the Air Force Public Affairs (June 11, 2018) http://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1547139/col-george-day-advanced-to-the-rank-of-brigadier-general/.

===Medal of Honor citation===
[[File:Airforce moh.jpg|100px|thumb|right|Air Force version of the Medal of Honor]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Rank and organization: Colonel (then Major), U.S. Air Force, Forward Air Controller Pilot of an F-100 aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;
Place and date: North Vietnam, 26 August 1967.&lt;br/&gt;
Entered service at: Sioux City, Iowa.&lt;br/&gt;
Born: February 24, 1925, Sioux City, Iowa.&lt;br/&gt;
General Orders: GB-180, 22 March 1976&lt;ref name="MT"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Citation: On 26 August 1967, Colonel Day was forced to eject from his aircraft over North Vietnam when it was hit by ground fire. His right arm was broken in 3 places, and his left knee was badly sprained. He was immediately captured by hostile forces and taken to a prison camp where he was interrogated and severely tortured. After causing the guards to relax their vigilance, Col. Day escaped into the jungle and began the trek toward South Vietnam. Despite injuries inflicted by fragments of a bomb or rocket, he continued southward surviving only on a few berries and uncooked frogs. He successfully evaded enemy patrols and reached the Bến Hải River, where he encountered U.S. artillery barrages. With the aid of a bamboo log float, Col. Day swam across the river and entered the demilitarized zone. Due to delirium, he lost his sense of direction and wandered aimlessly for several days. After several unsuccessful attempts to signal U.S. aircraft, he was ambushed and recaptured by the Viet Cong, sustaining gunshot wounds to his left hand and thigh. He was returned to the prison from which he had escaped and later was moved to Hanoi after giving his captors false information to questions put before him. Physically, Col. Day was totally debilitated and unable to perform even the simplest task for himself. Despite his many injuries, he continued to offer maximum resistance. His personal bravery in the face of deadly enemy pressure was significant in saving the lives of fellow aviators who were still flying against the enemy. Col. Day's conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Air Force and reflect great credit upon himself and the U.S. Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/vietnam-a-l.html |title=Medal of Honor recipients – Vietnam (A-L) |accessdate=October 31, 2008 |date=July 16, 2007 |publisher=[[United States Army]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Air Force Cross citation===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Air Force Cross is presented to George Everett Day, Colonel, United States Air Force, for extraordinary heroism in military operations against an opposing armed force as a Prisoner of War in North Vietnam from 16 July 1969 to 14 October 1969. During this period, Colonel Day was subjected to maximum punishment and torture by Vietnamese guards to obtain a detailed confession of escape plans, policies, and orders of the American senior ranking officer in the camp, and the communications methods used by the Americans interned in the camp. Colonel Day withstood this punishment and gave nothing of value to the Vietnamese, although he sustained many injuries and open wounds to his body. Through his extraordinary heroism and willpower, in the face of the enemy, Colonel Day reflected the highest credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.&lt;br/&gt;

'''Chicago-Style Stepping''', (also known as Steppin') is an [[urban culture|urban]] [[dance]] that originated in [[Chicago]] and continues to evolve while defining its unique style and culture within the context of mainstream [[Swing dance]]. Chicago-Style Stepping has gained popularity, particularly in the urban neighborhoods of America. "Chicago-Style Stepping" makes reference to other urban styles of dance found throughout the United States larger enclaves in cities such as Detroit, Cleveland, Baltimore and Washington, D.C.{{example needed|date=July 2014}}

== Origins ==
Chicago-Style Stepping, affectionately known as ''steppin,'' like most social dances, evolved from the "Bop" in the 1970s. In 1973 Sam Chatman was the first to coin the term "Chicago Step", and has been widely credited with marking steppin's evolutionary transition from Bop. 
The swing dance known as Steppin' is a part of the Western Swing family. The parent dance "Chicago Bop" may have been more Eastern Swing, but Steppin' has characteristics more similar to Western, especially its usage of a lane or slot. The term "Bop" was used to describe the dance form by Chicagoans until the early 1970s. Prior to that time "Bop" was a universally known term with its origin beginning sometime between 1945 &amp; 1950 to express music and dance. The dance known as Chicago Steppin' evolved from Bop and is more likely a derivative of Jitterbug. No published syllabuses exist for the dance.&lt;ref&gt;http://mistalocks.com/about-steppin-.html&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago-Style Stepping gained a real foothold when a local radio station, [[WVAZ]] (102.7FM/1390AM) began playing "Mr. Fix-It" and "Loves Gonna Last", two obscure songs recorded by Jeffree (Jeffree Perry) from his MCA 1979 Jeffree album. 

=== Popularity ===
R. Kelly's songs that featured Steppin' or Stepping helped move the dance into mainstream culture. The dance leveled off and was surpassed by other partner dance forms like New Style Hustle, Zouk, and Kizomba. The social dance is very popular in black communities across the United States.

=== Characteristics ===
Chicago Stepping is a slotted dance. The follower is typically kept traveling up and down the slot. Two action two one count cycle is the structure. Patterns like "roll out and rollback" describe the action on the slot or lane. The lane belongs to the follower and the leaders travel on, off and around the slot or lane.  Steppin' has a 6 or 8 count basic pattern. Its tempo ranges 70 to 100 bpm. Its basic rhythm pattern consists of a double and two syncopated triples. The patterns start traditionally on the downbeat of one. The leader's footwork is started on their Left and finished on their Right. The follower's dance is naturally opposite. The dance bears similiar characteristics to [[New York Hustle]] and [[West Coast Swing]].

'''''Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este''''' ("Competition of Elegance of Villa d'Este") is a ''[[Concours d'Elegance]]'' event for [[classic car|classic]] and [[vintage cars]]. It has taken place every year since 1929 during the last weekend of May near the [[Villa d'Este (Cernobbio)|Villa d'Este]] hotel in [[Cernobbio]], on the shores of [[Lake Como]] in [[Italy]]. Since 2011, the event takes place in the second half of May.

[[File:The Mikado.jpg|thumb|right|Theatre poster]]
The '''D'Oyly Carte Opera Company''' is a professional [[light opera]] company that staged [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[Savoy opera]]s nearly year-round in the UK and sometimes toured in Europe, North America and elsewhere, from the 1870s until 1982. The company was revived for short seasons and tours from 1988 to 2003, and with [[Scottish Opera]] it later co-produced two productions.

In 1875, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] asked the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]] and the composer [[Arthur Sullivan]] to collaborate on a short [[comic opera]] to round out an evening's entertainment.  When that work, ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', became a success, Carte put together a syndicate to produce a full-length Gilbert and Sullivan work, ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' (1877), followed by ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1878). After ''Pinafore'' became an international sensation, Carte jettisoned his difficult investors and formed a new partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan that became the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. The company produced the succeeding ten Gilbert and Sullivan operas and many [[Savoy operas|other operas]] and companion pieces, mostly at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in London, which Carte built in 1881 for that purpose. The company also mounted tours in Britain, New York and elsewhere, usually running several companies simultaneously. Carte's able assistant, [[Helen Lenoir]], became his wife in 1888 and, after his death in 1901, she ran the company until her own death in 1913.  By this time, it had become a year-round Gilbert and Sullivan touring repertory company.

Carte's son [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]] inherited the company.  Beginning in 1919, he mounted new seasons in London with new set and costume designs, while continuing the year-round tours in Britain and abroad. With the help of the director [[J. M. Gordon]] and the conductor [[Isidore Godfrey]], Carte ran the company for 35 years. He redesigned the Savoy Theatre in 1928 and sponsored a series of recordings over the years that helped to keep the operas popular.  After Rupert's death in 1948, his daughter [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte|Bridget]] inherited the company and hired [[Frederic Lloyd]] as general manager. The company continued to tour for 35 weeks each year, issue new recordings and play London seasons of Gilbert and Sullivan. In 1961, the last copyright on the Gilbert and Sullivan operas expired, and Bridget set up and endowed a charitable trust that presented the operas until mounting costs and a lack of public funding forced the closure of the company in 1982. It re-formed in 1988 with a legacy left by Bridget D'Oyly Carte, played short tours and London seasons, and issued some popular recordings. Denied significant funding from the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|English Arts Council]], it suspended productions in 2003. With Scottish Opera, it co-produced ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' 2013 and ''[[The Mikado]]'' in 2016.

Some of the company's performers, over the decades, became stars of their day and often moved on to careers in [[musical theatre]] or [[grand opera]]. The company licensed the operas for performance in Australasia and to numerous amateur troupes in Britain and elsewhere, providing orchestra parts and prompt books for hire. The company kept the Savoy operas in the public eye for over a century and left an enduring legacy of production styles and stage business that continue to be emulated in new productions, as well as recordings.

==History==

===Beginnings===
[[File:RichardD'OylyCarte.jpg|right|thumb|[[Richard D'Oyly Carte]]]]
By 1874, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], a musician and ambitious young [[impresario]], had begun producing operettas in London.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Jacobs, Arthur.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32311, "Carte, Richard D'Oyly (1844–1901)"]. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 12 September 2008 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He announced his ambitions on the front of the programme for one of his productions that year: "It is my desire to establish in London a permanent abode for light opera."&lt;ref&gt;"Our Representative Man", ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', 10 October 1874, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' reported, "Mr D'Oyly Carte is not only a skilful manager, but a trained musician, and he appears to have grasped the fact that the public are beginning to become weary of what is known as a genuine [[opera bouffe]], and are ready to welcome a musical entertainment of a higher order, such as a musician might produce with satisfaction".&lt;ref&gt;The Observer, 23 August 1874, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  He wanted to establish a body of tasteful English [[comic opera]] that would appeal to families, in contrast to the [[wikt:bawdy|bawdy]] [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and adaptations of French operettas and opera bouffes that dominated the London musical stage at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 108–09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, pp. 128–30&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1875, Carte was managing London's [[Royalty Theatre]].  Needing a short piece to round out an evening's entertainment featuring the popular [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]] operetta ''[[La Périchole]]'' he brought [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]] together.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert and Sullivan's only previous collaboration, ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'' (1871), was a Christmas entertainment for a different management and made only a modest impact.&lt;/ref&gt;  On tour in 1871, Carte had conducted [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s one-act comic opera ''[[Cox and Box]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Public Amusements", ''Liverpool Mercury'', 2 September 1871, p. 6.  The composer's brother [[Fred Sullivan]] played Cox.&lt;/ref&gt; which received an 1874 London revival.  In 1873, [[W. S. Gilbert]] had offered a libretto to Carte about an English courtroom, but at the time Carte knew of no composer available to set it to music.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte remembered Gilbert's libretto and suggested to Gilbert that Sullivan write the music for a one-act comic opera, ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', which was quickly composed and added to the Royalty's bill in March 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, George. "Whose ''Zoo''; or, When Did the ''Trial'' Begin?", ''Nineteenth Century Theatre Research'', 12, December 1984, pp. 39–54&lt;/ref&gt;  The witty and "very English" little piece proved even more popular than ''La Périchole'' and became the first great success of Carte's scheme to found his school of English comic opera, playing for 300 performances from 1875 to 1877, as well as touring and enjoying many revivals.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 29 March 1875, p. 10, quoted and discussed in Ainger, p. 109.  See also Stedman, pp. 129–30; Ainger, pp. 111 and 117; and Rollins and Witts, pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HelenD'OylyCarte.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Helen Lenoir]]]]
At the Theatre Royal, in [[Dublin]], Ireland in September 1875, while there managing the first tour of ''Trial by Jury'', Carte met a young Scottish actress, [[Helen Lenoir]].  She became fascinated by his vision for establishing a company to promote English comic opera&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; and gave up her next engagement to join his theatrical organisation as his secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), pp. 134–35&lt;/ref&gt;  Lenoir was well-educated, and her grasp of detail and diplomacy, as well as her organisational ability and business acumen, surpassed even Carte's.  She became intensely involved in all of his business affairs and soon managed many of the company's responsibilities, especially concerning touring.  She later travelled to America numerous times over the years to arrange the details of the company's New York engagements and American tours.&lt;ref name=helenDNB&gt;Stedman, Jane W.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/59169, "Carte, Helen (1852–1913)"].

Carte himself was the musical director of this travelling company, which disbanded after the tour.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David.

In 1876, Carte found four [[Equity partner|financial backers]] and formed the Comedy Opera Company in 1876 to produce more works by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], along with the works of other British lyricist/composer teams.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ainger130&gt;Ainger, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;  With this theatre company, Carte finally had the financial resources, after many failed attempts, to produce a new full-length Gilbert and Sullivan opera.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 110, 119–20 and 130–31; Jacobs, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte leased the Opera Comique, a small theatre off [[Strand, London|The Strand]].&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;Burgess, Michael. "Richard D'Oyly Carte", ''The Savoyard'', January 1975, pp. 7–11&lt;/ref&gt;  The first comic opera produced by the Comedy Opera Company was Gilbert and Sullivan's ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', about a tradesmanlike London sorcerer.  It opened in November 1877 together with ''[[Dora's Dream]]'', a curtain-raiser with music by Sullivan's assistant [[Alfred Cellier]] and words by [[Arthur Cecil]], a friend of both Gilbert and Sullivan.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of writing a piece for production by a theatre proprietor, as was usual in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] theatres, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte produced the show with their own financial support.  They were therefore able to select their own cast of performers, rather than being obliged to use the actors already engaged at the theatre.  They chose talented actors, most of whom were not well-known stars and did not command high fees, and to whom they could teach a more [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] style of performance than was commonly used at the time.  Carte's talent agency provided many of the artists to perform in the new work.  They then tailored their work to the particular abilities of these performers.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 111; Ainger, pp. 133–34&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the cast members, including principal comedian [[George Grossmith]], [[Richard Temple (opera singer)|Richard Temple]] and [[Rutland Barrington]], stayed with the company for almost 15 years.  Two other longstanding members of the company were [[Rosina Brandram]], who started in D'Oyly Carte touring companies with ''The Sorcerer'', and [[Jessie Bond]] who joined the group for ''Pinafore'' at the Opera Comique in 1878.&lt;ref name=Ainger152&gt;Ainger, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;  As Grossmith wrote in 1888, "We are all a very happy family."&lt;ref&gt;Grossmith, Chapter VI&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing that Gilbert and Sullivan shared his vision of broadening the audience for British light opera by increasing its quality and respectability, Carte gave Gilbert wider authority as a director than was customary among Victorian producers, and Gilbert tightly controlled all aspects of production, including staging, design and movement.&lt;ref&gt;Vorder Bruegge, Andrew.

For until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird, eccentric, yet intensely human beings&amp;nbsp;.... [They] conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Sorcerer'' ran for 178 performances, a healthy run at the time, making a profit,&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 147–48&lt;/ref&gt;  and Carte sent out a touring company in March 1878.&lt;ref name=Ainger152/&gt;  Sheet music from the show sold well, and [[Organ grinder|street musicians]] played the melodies.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 113–14&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of ''The Sorcerer'' showed Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan that there was a future in family-friendly English comic opera.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 141–48&lt;/ref&gt;

The next Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration, ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', opened in May 1878. The opera's initial slow business was generally ascribed to a heat wave that made the stuffy Opera Comique particularly uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (1996), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Jessie.

But see Ainger, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's partners in the Comedy Opera Company lost confidence in the show and posted closing notices.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; After Carte made promotional efforts and Sullivan included some of the ''Pinafore'' music in several promenade concerts that he conducted at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], ''Pinafore'' became a hit.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;  The Opera Comique was required to close at Christmas 1878 for repairs to drainage and sewage under the Public Health Act of 1875.  Carte used the enforced closure of the theatre to invoke a contract clause reverting the rights of ''Pinafore'' and ''Sorcerer'' to Gilbert and Sullivan after the initial run of ''H.M.S. Pinafore''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 165–67&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte then took a six-month personal lease on the theatre beginning on 1 February 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte persuaded Gilbert and Sullivan that when their original agreement with the Comedy Opera Company expired in July 1879, a business partnership among the three of them would be to their advantage.&lt;ref name=joseph18&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  The three each put up £1,000 and formed a new partnership under the name "Mr Richard D'Oyly Carte's Opera Company".&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 162–67&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the partnership agreement, once the expenses of mounting the productions had been deducted, each of the three men was entitled to one third of the profits.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

On 31 July 1879, the last day of their agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan, the directors of the Comedy Opera Company attempted to repossess the set by force during a performance, causing a celebrated fracas.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 170–72&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte's stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, pp. 170–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-opcom.html "The Fracas at the Opera Comique"].

In an effort to head off unauthorised American productions of their next opera, ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', Carte and his partners opened it in New York on 31 December 1879, prior to its 1880 London premiere.&lt;ref name=Ainger182/&gt;  ''Pirates'' was the only [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] opera to have its official premiere in America.  Carte and his partners hoped to forestall further "piracy" by establishing the authorised production and tours in America before others could copy it and by delaying publication of the score and libretto.

The next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', opened at the Opera Comique in April 1881 and was another big success, becoming the second longest-running piece in the series and enjoying numerous foreign productions.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp 16–19&lt;/ref&gt;  Patience satirised the self-indulgent [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic movement]] of the 1870s and '80s in England, part of the 19th-century European movement that emphasised [[aesthetic]] values over moral or social themes in literature, [[fine art]], the [[decorative arts]], and interior design.&lt;ref&gt;Fargis, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denney, Colleen.

As Jessie Bond described in her autobiography:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No lingering about was allowed, no gossiping with the other actors; the women’s dressing-rooms were on one side of the stage, the men's on the other, and when we were not actually playing we had to mount at once our respective narrow staircases&amp;nbsp;– sheep rigorously separated from the goats!  Once, when my mother came to see me in London, expecting to find me dwelling in haunts of gilded luxury, and far down the road to perdition, I took her behind the scenes and showed her the arrangements for the actors and actresses, conventual in their austerity. ...  I think there never was a theatre run on lines of such strict propriety; no breath of scandal ever touched it in all the twenty years of my experience.  Gilbert would suffer no loose word or gesture either behind the stage or on it, and watched over us young women like a dragon.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Jessie.

[[File:1881 Savoy Theatre.jpg|left|thumb|Original facade of the [[Savoy Theatre]], c. 1881]]
With profits from the success of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and his concert and lecture agency (his talent roster included [[Adelina Patti]], [[Clara Schumann]], [[Jacques Offenbach]], [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Charles Gounod]]),&lt;ref name=Ainger130/&gt; Carte bought property along the Strand with frontage onto the Thames Embankment, where he built the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;"100 Electrifying Years", ''The Savoyard'', Volume XX no. 2, D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust, September 1981, pp. 4–6&lt;/ref&gt;  He chose the name in honour of the [[Savoy Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;  The Savoy Theatre was a state-of-the-art facility, setting a new standard for technology, comfort and decor.  It was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electric lights&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; and seated nearly 1,300 people (compared to the Opera Comique's 862).&lt;ref&gt;Wearing, J. P. ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/3206178 "The London West End Theatre in the 1890s"]. ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 29, No. 3 (October 1977), pp. 320–32, The Johns Hopkins University Press (online by subscription to JSTOR)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Patience'' was the first production at the new theatre, transferring there on 10 October 1881.  The first generator proved too small to power the whole building, and though the entire front-of-house was electrically lit, the stage was lit by gas until 28 December 1881.  At that performance, Carte stepped on stage and broke a glowing lightbulb before the audience to demonstrate the safety of the new technology.&lt;ref name=bettany&gt;Bettany, unnumbered page (there are no page numbers in the book)&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Times'' concluded that the theatre "is admirably adapted for its purpose, its acoustic qualities are excellent, and all reasonable demands of comfort and taste are complied with."&lt;ref&gt;"The Savoy Theatre", ''The Times'', 11 October 1881, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte and his manager, [[George Edwardes]] (later famous as manager of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]]), introduced several innovations at the theatre, including numbered seating, free programme booklets, the "queue" system for the pit and gallery (an American idea) and a policy of no tipping for cloakroom or other services.&lt;ref name=bettany/&gt;  Daily expenses at the theatre were about half the possible takings from ticket sales.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dark and Grey, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;  The last eight of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas were premièred at the Savoy.

During the years when the Gilbert and Sullivan operas were being written, the company also produced [[Savoy opera#Companion pieces|operas by other composer–librettist teams]], either as curtain-raisers to the Gilbert and Sullivan pieces, or as touring productions, as well as other works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between Savoy operas, and Carte also toured the Gilbert and Sullivan operas extensively.  For example, a souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of ''Patience'' in London and its 100th performance in New York shows that, aside from these two productions of ''Patience'', Carte was simultaneously producing two companies touring with ''Patience'', two companies touring with other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a company touring with ''[[Olivette (opera)|Olivette]]'' (co-produced with [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]]) a company touring ''[[Claude Duval (opera)|Claude Duval]]'' in America, a production of ''Youth'' running at a New York theatre, a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes (a war correspondent) and productions of ''Patience'', ''Pirates'', ''Claude Duval'' and ''[[Billee Taylor]]'' in association with [[J. C. Williamson]] in Australia, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091001081006/http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/museum/patience/250perf/pc250.html 250th Anniversary ''Patience'' programme, 1881]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s, Carte also introduced the practice of licensing amateur theatrical societies to present works for which he held the rights, increasing their popularity and the sales of scores and libretti, as well as the rental of band parts.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), pp. 81 and 163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bradley25&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 25, noting that royalties from British amateur companies were 10% of the box office take plus hire costs for the band parts and prompt books&lt;/ref&gt;  This had an important influence on amateur theatre in general.  Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that, prior to the creation of the [[Savoy opera]]s, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals.  After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies licensed to perform the operas, professionals recognised that the amateur societies "support the culture of music and the drama.  They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites."&lt;ref&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;  Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to "the popularity of, and infectious craze for performing, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas".&lt;ref name="Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394"&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National Operatic and Dramatic Association]] was founded in 1899.  It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 British societies were producing Gilbert and Sullivan operas that year.&lt;ref name="Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394"/&gt;  Carte insisted that amateur companies follow the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company staging, using its prompt books.&lt;ref name=Bradley25/&gt;  Even after the copyrights expired at the end of 1961, the company continued to, and still does, rent out band parts to companies around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), pp. 30 and 68; see also [http://www.doylycarte.org.uk/services/services_index.htm the services page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417061020/http://doylycarte.org.uk/services/services_index.htm |date=17 April 2009 }} at the D'Oyly Carte Opera company website&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Iolanthe'' to ''The Gondoliers''===
After ''Patience'', the company produced ''[[Iolanthe]]'', which opened in 1882.  During its run, in February 1883, Carte signed a five-year partnership agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan, obligating them to create new operas for the company upon six months' notice.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;  Sullivan had not intended immediately to write a new work with Gilbert, but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in November 1882 and must have felt the long-term contract necessary for his security.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 217–19&lt;/ref&gt;  But he soon felt trapped.&lt;ref name=Jacobs188&gt;Jacobs, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;  Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther comments, regarding the agreement: "Effectively, it made [Gilbert and Sullivan] Carte's employees&amp;nbsp;– a situation which created its own resentments."&lt;ref name=Crothcarpet&gt;Crowther, Andrew.

''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', 28 June 1997, accessed 7 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The partnership's next opera, ''[[Princess Ida]]'', opened in January 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 225–26&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte soon saw that ''Ida'' was running weakly at the box office and invoked the agreement to call upon his partners for a new opera to be written.  Almost from the beginning of the partnership, the musical establishment put pressure on Sullivan to abandon comic opera,&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''The Times'', 27 May 1878, p. 6, favourably reviewing ''H.M.S. Pinafore'', nevertheless added, "we cannot suppress a word of regret that the composer on whom before all others the chances of a national school of music depend should confine himself ... to a class of production which, however attractive, is hardly worthy of the efforts of an accomplished and serious artist."&lt;/ref&gt; and he soon regretted having signed the five-year contract.&lt;ref name=Jacobs188/&gt;  In March 1884, Sullivan told Carte that "it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself."&lt;ref name=Crothcarpet/&gt;

[[File:The Mikado Three Little Maids.jpg|thumb|left|Lithograph from ''The Mikado'']]
During this conflict and others during the 1880s, Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently had to smooth over the partners' differences with a mixture of friendship and business acumen.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Sullivan asked to be released from the partnership on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Arthur. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26772?docPos=7 "Sullivan, Arthur Seymour"]. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 11 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, they coaxed eight comic operas out of Gilbert and Sullivan in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ''Pirates'' premiered on 31 December 1879, so technically it's seven, but Joseph counts it as eight. --&gt;  When ''Princess Ida'' closed after a comparatively short run of nine months, for the first time in the partnership's history, the next opera was not ready.  To make matters worse, Gilbert suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge&amp;nbsp;– a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected, and he now rejected the "lozenge plot" again.  Gilbert eventually came up with a new idea and began work in May 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 230–33&lt;/ref&gt;

The company produced the first revival of ''The Sorcerer'', together with ''Trial by Jury'', and matinees of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' played by a cast of children, while waiting for the new work to be completed.  This became the partnership's most successful opera, ''[[The Mikado]]'', which opened in March 1885.&lt;ref name=Wilson13&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  The piece satirised British institutions by setting them in a fictional Japan.  At the same time, it took advantage of the Victorian craze for the exotic Far East using the "picturesque" scenery and costumes of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Brian.  "Japan in London 1885", ''W. S.

The partnership's next opera was ''[[Ruddigore]]'', which opened in January 1887.  It satirised and used elements of Victorian stock [[melodrama]].&lt;ref&gt;Walmisley, Guy H. and Claude A. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/ruddigore/html/intro.html Excerpt about ''Ruddigore''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001162103/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas///ruddigore/html/intro.html |date=1 October 2009 }} from ''Tit-Willow; or Notes and Jottings on Gilbert and Sullivan Operas'' (London: 1964), reproduced at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 9 January 2005 accessed 12 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The piece, though profitable, was a relative disappointment after the extraordinary success of ''The Mikado''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;  When ''Ruddigore'' closed after a run of only nine months, the company mounted revivals of earlier Gilbert and Sullivan operas for almost a year.  After another attempt by Gilbert to persuade Sullivan to set a "lozenge plot", Gilbert met his collaborator half way by writing a serio-comic plot for ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', which premiered in October 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;  The opera was a success, running for over a year, with strong New York and touring productions.  During the run, in March 1889, Sullivan again expressed reluctance to write another comic opera, asking if Gilbert would write a "dramatic work on a larger musical scale".&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;  Gilbert declined, but offered a compromise that Sullivan ultimately accepted: The two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan could work on a grand opera (''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'') for a new theatre that Carte was constructing to present British grand opera.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;  The new comic opera was ''[[The Gondoliers]]'', which opened in December 1889 and became one of the partnership's greatest successes.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;  After Carte's first wife died in 1885, Carte married Helen Lenoir in 1888, who was, by this time, nearly as important in managing the company as Carte himself.&lt;ref name=helenDNB/&gt;

[[File:Gondo1990.jpg|right|220px]]
During these years, the company's high production values, and the quality of the operas, created a national and international taste for them, and the company mounted touring productions throughout the provinces, in America (generally managed by Helen), Europe&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Bentley/&gt;  [[Queen Victoria]] honoured the company by calling for a [[Royal Command Performance]] of ''The Gondoliers'' at [[Windsor Castle]] in 1891.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;  [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], writing in ''[[The World (journal)|The World]]'' in October 1893, commented, "Those who are old enough to compare the Savoy performances with those of the dark ages, taking into account the pictorial treatment of the fabrics and colours on the stage, the cultivation and intelligence of the choristers, the quality of the orchestra, and the degree of artistic good breeding, so to speak, expected from the principals, best know how great an advance has been made by Mr. D'Oyly Carte."&lt;ref&gt;"Utopian Gilbert and Sullivan", ''The World'', 11 October 1893, reprinted in Laurence, pp. 975–76&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Carpet Quarrel and the end of the partnership===
On 22 April 1890, during the run of ''The Gondoliers'', Gilbert discovered that maintenance expenses for the theatre, including a new £500&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php?use%5B%5D=CPI&amp;use%5B%5D=DEFIND&amp;use%5B%5D=WAGE&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPCP&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPC&amp;year_early=1890&amp;pound71=500&amp;shilling71=&amp;pence71=&amp;amount=500&amp;year_source=1890&amp;year_result=2006 |title=Approximately £37,818.60 in 2006 prices |access-date=19 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714064621/http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php?use%5B%5D=CPI&amp;use%5B%5D=DEFIND&amp;use%5B%5D=WAGE&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPCP&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPC&amp;year_early=1890&amp;pound71=500&amp;shilling71=&amp;pence71=&amp;amount=500&amp;year_source=1890&amp;year_result=2006 |archive-date=14 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; carpet for the front lobby of the theatre, were being charged to the partnership instead of borne by Carte.  Gilbert confronted Carte, and Carte refused to reconsider the accounts: Even though the amount of the charge was not great, Gilbert felt it was a moral issue involving Carte's integrity, and he could not look past it.  Gilbert wrote in a letter to Sullivan that "I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen".&lt;ref name=Crothcarpet/&gt;  Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte "in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial."&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;  Gilbert brought a lawsuit, but Sullivan sided with Carte, who was building the [[Palace Theatre, London|Royal English Opera House]], the inaugural production of which was to be Sullivan's forthcoming grand opera.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;  Gilbert won the suit, but the partnership disbanded.&lt;ref name=vowed&gt;Shepherd, Marc.

Sullivan's opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'', had a successful run, but no other operas shared Carte's new opera house, and so the theatre soon failed.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;  Carte sold the opera house, and it eventually became the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/PalaceTheatre.htm The Palace Theatre] at the Arthur Lloyd theatre site, accessed 13 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See "The Palace Theatre", ''The Times'', 12 December 1892, p. 7; "The Theatres in 1892", ''The Times'', 31 December 1892, p. 3; and "Palace Theatre as Cinema. Stage Plays also to be Given", ''The Times'', 31 January 1921, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''The Gondoliers'' closed in 1891, Gilbert withdrew the performance rights to his libretti and vowed to write no more operas for the Savoy.&lt;ref name=vowed/&gt;  The D'Oyly Carte company turned to new writing teams for the Savoy, first producing ''[[The Nautch Girl]]'', by [[George Dance (dramatist)|George Dance]], [[Frank Desprez]] and [[Edward Solomon]], which ran for a satisfying 200 performances in 1891–92.  Next was a revival of Solomon and [[Sydney Grundy]]'s ''[[The Vicar of Bray (opera)|The Vicar of Bray]]'', which played through the summer of 1892.  Grundy and Sullivan's ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]'' then held the stage until April 1893.&lt;ref name=joseph111&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  While the company presented new pieces and revivals at the Savoy, Carte's touring companies continued to play throughout Britain and in America.  In 1894, for example, Carte had four companies touring Britain and one playing in America.&lt;ref&gt;"The Savoyards on Tour", ''The Sketch'', 13 June 1894, pp. 373–74&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Comic Opera at the Savoy.png|left|thumb|[[George Grossmith|Grossmith]] comforts [[Richard D'Oyly Carte|Carte]] after failure of ''[[The Grand Duke]]''.]]
Gilbert's aggressive, though successful, legal action had embittered Sullivan and Carte, but the partnership had been so profitable that the Cartes eventually sought to reunite Gilbert and Sullivan.  The reconciliation finally came through the efforts of [[Chappell &amp; Co.|Tom Chappell]], who published the sheet music to the Savoy operas.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1893, the company produced the penultimate Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration, ''[[Utopia, Limited]]''.  While ''Utopia'' was being prepared, the company produced ''[[Jane Annie]]'', by [[J. M. Barrie]] and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], with music by [[Ernest Ford]].  Despite the popularity of Barrie and Conan Doyle, the show was a flop, closing in July 1893 after only 51 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Tillett, Selwyn.  "Jane Annie", in ''Sullivan Society Journal'', 1993 centenary issue on ''Utopia, Limited''&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Utopia'' was the Savoy's most expensive production to date, but it ran for a comparatively disappointing 245 performances, until June 1894, turning a very modest profit.&lt;ref name=joseph111/&gt;  The company then played first ''[[Mirette (opera)|Mirette]]'', composed by [[André Messager]], then ''[[The Chieftain]]'', by [[Francis Burnand|F. C. Burnand]] and Sullivan.  These ran for 102 and 97 performances, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;  After ''The Chieftain'' closed, the company toured the London suburbs, while Carte leased the Savoy Theatre to the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]].  The theatre was dark during the summer of 1895, reopening in November for a revival of ''[[The Mikado]]''.&lt;ref name=Wilson52&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed by ''[[The Grand Duke]]'', in 1896, which ran for 123 performances and was Gilbert and Sullivan's only financial failure.  ''The Gondoliers'' turned out to be Gilbert and Sullivan's last big hit, and after ''The Grand Duke'', the two men never collaborated again.&lt;ref name=joseph111/&gt;

In 1894, Carte had hired his son, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]], as an assistant.  Rupert assisted Mrs. Carte and [[W. S. Gilbert]] with the first revival of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' at the Savoy in May 1897.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Post]]'', 7 January 1948&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the later 1890s, Carte's health was declining, and Mrs. Carte assumed more and more of the responsibilities of running the opera company.  She profitably managed the theatre and the provincial touring companies.&lt;ref name=helenDNB/&gt;  The Savoy's shows during this period received comparatively short runs, including ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'' (1897), ''[[The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein]]'' (1897), ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'' (1898) and ''[[The Lucky Star]]'' (1899), as well as revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref name=Wilson52/&gt;  Sullivan's ''The Beauty Stone'' ran for only 50 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1899, the Savoy finally had a new success, with Sullivan and [[Basil Hood]]'s ''[[The Rose of Persia]]'', which ran for 213 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Neither Carte nor Sullivan lived to see the production of Sullivan and Hood's ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'' (1901), for which [[Edward German]] completed the score.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' obituary, 4 April 1901, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century===
Carte left his theatre, opera company and hotels to his wife, who assumed full control of the family businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;  Her London and touring companies continued to present the Savoy operas in Britain and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 111–27&lt;/ref&gt;  She leased the Savoy Theatre to [[William Greet]] in 1901 and oversaw his management of the company's revival of ''Iolanthe'' and the production of several new comic operas, including ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'' (1901), ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' (1902) and ''[[A Princess of Kensington]]'' (with music by [[Edward German]], libretto by [[Basil Hood]]), which ran for four months in early 1903 and then toured.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;  When ''A Princess of Kensington'' closed at the Savoy, Mrs. Carte leased the theatre to other managements until 8 December 1906.  The company's fortunes declined for a time, and by 1904 there was only a single touring company wending its way through the British provinces, when it took a seven-month South African tour.&lt;ref name=Wilson52/&gt;

In 1906–07, Mrs. Carte staged a repertory season at the Savoy Theatre, with Gilbert returning to direct.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;  The season, which included ''Yeomen'', ''The Gondoliers'', ''Patience'' and ''Iolanthe'', was a sensation&lt;ref name=Wilson52/&gt; and led to another in 1908–09 including ''The Mikado'', ''Pinafore'', ''Iolanthe'', ''Pirates'', ''The Gondoliers'' and ''Yeomen''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, pp. 83–87&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterwards, however, Mrs. Carte's health prevented her from staging more London seasons.&lt;ref&gt;Carte, Bridget D'Oyly. Foreword to Mander, Raymond and Joe Mitchenson, ''A Picture History of Gilbert and Sullivan'', Vista Books, London, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;  She retired and leased the theatre to [[C. H. Workman]], and the company did not perform in London again until 1919, although it continued to tour throughout Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), pp. 138 and 186&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rupert carte 1919.jpg|right|frame|[[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]]]]
After Gilbert's death in 1911, the company continued to produce productions of the operas in repertory until 1982.  In 1911, Helen Carte hired [[J. M. Gordon]] as stage manager. Gordon, who was promoted to stage director in 1922,&lt;ref&gt;''Rollins and Witts'', p. ii&lt;/ref&gt; had been a member of the company and a stage manager under Gilbert's direction, and he fiercely preserved the company's performing traditions in exacting detail for 28 years.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David (ed). [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/G/GordonJM.htm J M Gordon] at ''Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'', accessed 21 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Except for ''[[Ruddigore]]'', which underwent some cuts and received a new overture,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cox and Box]]'' was cut and arranged into a short curtain raiser&lt;/ref&gt; very few changes were made to the text and music of the operas as Gilbert and Sullivan had produced them, and the company stayed true to Gilbert's period settings. Even after Gordon's death, many of Gilbert's directorial concepts survived, both in the stage directions printed in the libretti and as preserved in company prompt books. Original choreography was also maintained.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, 1882 images of the Act II trio in ''Iolanthe'' in ''Mander and Michenson'', p. 65 and 1974 images of the same scene on the sleeve of D'Oyly Carte recording, Decca SKL 5188/9&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the company's staging became accepted as traditional by Gilbert and Sullivan fans, and many of these traditional stagings are still imitated today in productions by both amateur and professional companies.&lt;ref name=Bradley30/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bradley61&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leonard&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article7035514.ece "Patricia Leonard: principal contralto of the D’Oyly Carte opera"]. ''[[The Times]]'', 22 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helen Carte]] died in 1913, and Carte's son [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]] inherited the company.&lt;ref&gt;Carte's older son, Lucas, was a barrister and took no part in the family businesses.  He died of tuberculosis in 1907, aged 34.  See Obituary of Lucas D'Oyly Carte, ''The Times'', 22 January 1907, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  During World War I, he was away serving in the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name=bettany/&gt; According to H. M. Walbrook, "Through the years of the Great War [the company] continued to be on tour through the country, drawing large and grateful audiences everywhere.  They helped to sustain the spirits of the people during that stern period, and by so doing they helped to win the victory."&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/walbrook/chap16.html Walbrook, H. M. ''Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera, A History and a Comment'', Chapter XVI] (1920) London: F. V. White &amp; Co. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; The company also toured in North America several times, beginning with a Canadian tour in 1927.&lt;ref name=Joseph160/&gt;

Rupert D'Oyly Carte found the company's productions increasingly "dowdy", however, and on his return from the war, he determined to refresh them, bringing in new designers including W. Bridges-Adams for the sets, and, for the costumes, [[George Sheringham]] and [[Hugo Rumbold]]. He also commissioned new costumes from [[Percy Anderson]] who had worked with Gilbert and Richard D'Oyly Carte on the original productions of the later Savoy operas.&lt;ref name=Wilson90&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Ricketts]] redesigned sets and costumes for ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1926) and ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1929). His costumes for ''The Mikado'' were retained by all subsequent designers until 1982.  In an interview in ''[[The Observer]]'' in August 1919, Carte set out his policy for staging the operas: "They will be played precisely in their original form, without any alteration to the words, or any attempt to bring them up to date."&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 24 August 1919, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  This uncompromising declaration was modified in a later interview in which he said, "the plays are all being restaged. ... Gilbert's words will be unaltered, though there will be some freshness in the method of rendering them.  Artists must have scope for their individuality, and new singers cannot be tied down to imitate slavishly those who made successes in the old days."&lt;ref name=bettany/&gt;

[[File:1919-20season.jpg|left|thumb|300px|[[Souvenir program]]me cover, 1919–20 season]]
The main company made a triumphant return to London for the 1919–20 season at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre|Prince's Theatre]], playing most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas in repertory and showing off the new sets and costumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/carte/1919/index.html Information about the 1919–20 D'Oyly Carte season] at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 20 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of this season led to additional London seasons in 1919–20, 1921–22, 1924, and 1926; the company toured the rest of the year.&lt;ref name=Joseph160&gt;Joseph (1994), pp. 160 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte's first London season stimulated renewed interest in the operas, and by 1920 he had established a second, smaller company to tour smaller towns.  It was disbanded in 1927, although the company often ran multiple tours simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Wilson90/&gt;
For London seasons, Carte engaged guest conductors, first [[Geoffrey Toye]], then [[Malcolm Sargent]], who examined Sullivan's manuscript scores and purged the orchestral parts of accretions.  So striking was the orchestral sound produced by Sargent that the press thought he had retouched the scores, and Carte had the pleasant duty of correcting their error.  In a letter to ''[[The Times]]'', he noted that "the details of the orchestration sounded so fresh that some of the critics thought them actually new... the opera was played last night exactly as written by Sullivan."&lt;ref&gt;Carte, Rupert D'Oyly. ''The Times'', 22 September 1926, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte also hired [[Harry Norris (conductor)|Harry Norris]], who started with the touring company, then was Toye's assistant before becoming musical director.

In 1917, the company made the first complete recording of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, ''[[The Mikado]]'', for the [[Gramophone Company]] (later known as [[His Master's Voice]]).  Rupert D'Oyly Carte supervised the company's recordings, including eight more acoustic recordings by 1924, and a series of complete electrical recordings in the late 1920s and early 1930s.  There were additional recordings, in high fidelity, for [[Decca Records]], in the late 1940s and early 1950s and stereo recordings in the late 1950s and early 1960s, all supervised after Rupert's death by his daughter, [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/series.htm Links to detailed descriptions of the various series of D'Oyly Carte recordings] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304054314/http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/series.htm |date=4 March 2008 }}.

The Savoy also hosted London seasons for the company in 1930–31, 1933, 1941, 1951, 1954, 1961, 1963–64, and 1975.  London seasons at other theatres, mostly [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]], included summer seasons from 1935 to 1939, 1942, 1947 to 1950, 1953, 1971, 1975, 1977 and 1980; and winter seasons in 1956–57, 1958–59, 1960–61, 1963–64, 1965–66, 1967–68, and then every winter between 1969–70 and 1981–82.&lt;ref&gt;In addition to the Savoy and Sadler's Wells, London seasons were at the Prince's Theatre (1956–57, 1958–59, and 1960–61); the [[Saville Theatre]] (1963–64, 1965–66 and 1967–68); the [[Royal Festival Hall]] (1971 and 1975); and the [[Adelphi Theatre]], 1981–82).

Guest conductors during Godfrey's tenure were Sargent and [[Boyd Neel]].  [[Henry Lytton]] retired in 1934 after a quarter century as the principal comedian, and the company made a highly successful eight-month North American tour with its new principal comedian, [[Martyn Green]].

On 3 September 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, the British government ordered the immediate and indefinite closure of all theatres.  Carte cancelled the autumn tour and disbanded the company.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;  Theatres were permitted to reopen from 9 September,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 9 September 1939, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; but it took some weeks to re-form the company. Some performers, including Martyn Green, were already committed elsewhere, and [[Grahame Clifford]] was engaged to play his roles.  The company resumed touring, in [[Edinburgh]], on Christmas Day 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;  The company continued to perform throughout the war, both on tour and in London, but in 1940 German bombing destroyed the sets and costumes for five of its shows: ''Cox and Box'', ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[Princess Ida]]'' and ''Ruddigore''.  The old productions of ''Pinafore'' and ''Cox and Box'' were recreated shortly after the war, and ''Ruddigore'' received a new production, planned by Carte but not seen until after his death.  The other two operas took longer to rejoin the company's repertory.&lt;ref&gt;''Pinafore'' re-entered the repertory in July 1947, ''Cox and Box'' in the 1947/48 season, ''Ruddigore'' in November 1948, and ''Princess Ida'' in September 1954 (see Rollins and Witts, pp. 171–79 and VII–VIII).  ''The Sorcerer'' was not revived until April 1971 (see ''The Times'', 2 April 1971, p. 10)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, for the first wartime season, [[Peter Goffin]], a protege of Carte's daughter, Bridget, had designed a new production of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' first seen in January 1940, and his new ''[[Ruddigore]]'' debuted in 1948.  A return to the U.S. in 1947 was very successful, and the company resumed frequent visits to America.&lt;ref name=Wilson128/&gt;

Rupert died in 1948, leaving a strong company to his daughter [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), pp. 273–74&lt;/ref&gt;  She soon hired [[Frederic Lloyd]] as general manager.  Bridget and Lloyd also took steps to keep the productions fresh, engaging designers to redesign the costumes and scenery.  Peter Goffin, who had redesigned ''Yeomen'' (1939) and ''Ruddigore'' (1948) for the company, created new settings and costumes for Bridget for half a dozen more productions: ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1952; settings only, most of the celebrated [[Charles Ricketts]] costumes being retained), ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' (1957), ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1958), ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' (1959), ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1961; ladies' costumes) and ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1961).  A new production of ''[[Princess Ida]]'' in 1954 was designed by James Wade.&lt;ref name=Wilson154&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eleanor Evans]], however, was an example of one of the company's stage directors (from 1949 to 1953) who was said to be reluctant to update and freshen stagings.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, John. [http://pinafore.www3.50megs.com/k-sandford-fav.html "The Ones that I Like"], Interview with Sandford, c. 1972, at the Memories of the D'Oyly Carte website&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, Goffin designed a unit set for the company to facilitate touring, reducing the number of vans required to carry the scenery from twenty to nine.&lt;ref name=Wilson154/&gt;  A 1957 review of ''Yeomen'' in ''The Times'' praised the production and marvelled at "the continued vitality of the Savoy operas", noting: "The opera remains enchanting; the singing seems, on the whole, better and more musical than that which one used to hear, say, 30 years since; and though the acting lacks some of the richly crusted performances of those days, it is perhaps none the worse for that".&lt;ref&gt;"The Lasting Charm of Gilbert and Sullivan", ''The Times'', 14 February 1957, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1949, the company began a new series of recordings with Decca, featuring Green, who had returned to the company after the war, and continued the series with his successor, [[Peter Pratt]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, pp. 151 and 154&lt;/ref&gt;  The company cooperated with the production of the 1953 film ''[[The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan]]'', which used some former members of the company in the cast.  In 1955, the company gave a seven-month tour to the U.S. to celebrate the 75th anniversary of its first American productions.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1959, the company began the tradition of holding a zany "last night" on the last evening of each London season.&lt;ref name=Wilson154/&gt;

===Later years and closing===
With the approaching end of the D'Oyly Carte monopoly on [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] performances, when the copyright on Gilbert's words expired in 1961 (Sullivan’s music had already come out of copyright at the end of 1950), Bridget D'Oyly Carte contributed the company and all its assets to an independent charitable trust.  She endowed the trust with the company's scenery, costumes, band parts and other assets, together with a cash endowment, and supervised the production of operas on behalf of the trust until economic necessity forced the closure of the company in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  As it turned out, competing professional productions of Gilbert and Sullivan did not harm the company.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 1960, the company re-recorded all of the operas with Pratt's successor, [[John Reed (actor)|John Reed]],&lt;ref&gt;supported by such strong singers as [[Kenneth Sandford]], [[Donald Adams]], [[Thomas Round]], [[Valerie Masterson]], [[Jean Hindmarsh]] and [[Gillian Knight]]&lt;/ref&gt; and also recorded a number of other Sullivan pieces.  It made a [[The Mikado (1967 film)|cinema film of ''The Mikado'']] in 1966, and recorded for television broadcast its productions of ''Patience'' (1965) and ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' (1973).&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Mark.

''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1960s, the company gave five North American tours.&lt;ref name=Wilson178&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;  A new stage director, [[Michael Heyland]], was hired in 1969, staying until 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (2007), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Among his new productions were ''The Sorcerer'' in 1971, ''Utopia, Limited'' in 1975 and ''Iolanthe'' in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 40. ''The Sorcerer'' had costume and set designs by [[Osbert Lancaster]]. See: "The Sorcerer to be revived", ''The Times'' , 5 March 1971, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In March and April 1975, after the regular London season at Sadler's Wells, the company moved to the Savoy Theatre for a fortnight's centennial performances, beginning on 25 March, the 100th anniversary of the first performance of ''Trial by Jury''.  All thirteen surviving Gilbert and Sullivan operas were performed in chronological order.  ''Trial by Jury'' was given four times, as a curtain raiser to ''The Sorcerer'', ''Pinafore'' and ''Pirates'' and as an afterpiece following ''The Grand Duke''.&lt;ref name=Wilson178/&gt;  Before the first of the four performances of ''Trial'', a specially written curtain raiser by [[William Douglas-Home]], called ''Dramatic Licence'', was played by Peter Pratt as [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], [[Kenneth Sandford]] as Gilbert and [[John Ayldon]] as Sullivan, in which Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte plan the birth of ''Trial'' in 1875; afterwards, the prime minister, [[Harold Wilson]], and Bridget D'Oyly Carte each gave a short speech.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Elizabeth. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/kenneth-sandford-550525.html Kenneth Sandford obituary]. ''The Independent'', 23 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  A highlight of the season was a new staging of ''Utopia Limited'' (later given again at the [[Royal Festival Hall]]), its first revival by the company. ''The Grand Duke'' was given as a concert performance, with narration by the [[BBC]] presenter [[Richard Baker (broadcaster)|Richard Baker]]. [[Royston Nash]], who was at the company's musical helm from 1971 to 1979, conducted most of the performances, with [[Isidore Godfrey]] (''Pinafore'') and [[Charles Mackerras|Sir Charles Mackerras]] (''Pirates'' and ''Mikado'') as guest conductors.  Princes Philip and Andrew saw ''The Gondoliers''.  In the final performance of ''Trial by Jury'', the regular D'Oyly Carte chorus was augmented by fourteen former stars of the company: [[Sylvia Cecil]], [[Elsie Griffin]], [[Ivan Menzies]], [[John Dean (singer)|John Dean]], [[Radley Flynn]], Elizabeth Nickell-Lean, [[Ella Halman]], [[Leonard Osborn]], Cynthia Morey, [[Jeffrey Skitch]], Alan Barrett, Mary Sansom, [[Philip Potter]] and Gillian Humphreys.&lt;ref&gt;''The Savoyard'', Vol. 14, No. 2, September 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/index.htm Biographies of all of these performers] are at the ''Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, during [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s Jubilee Year, the company gave a [[Royal Command Performance]] of ''Pinafore'' at [[Windsor Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;  The company visited Denmark in 1970, Rome in 1974, and gave its last American tours in 1976 and 1978.  Its last tour, in  [[Australasia]], conducted by the company's new musical director, Fraser Goulding, was a success in 1979.&lt;ref name=Wilson178/&gt;  Throughout the 20th century, until 1982, the company toured, on average, for 35 weeks per year (in addition to its 13-week London seasons), fostering a "strong family atmosphere, reinforced by the number of marriages in the company and the fact that so many people stayed with it for so long."&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;  Principal soprano [[Valerie Masterson]] married the company's principal flautist, Andrew March.  She explained, "people didn't have flats or houses ... touring was your life."&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout its history, the company maintained strict moral standards, and it was sometimes referred to as the "Savoy boarding school", enforcing policies regarding behaviour on and off stage, and even a dress code.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), pp. 31–34&lt;/ref&gt;  Soprano Cynthia Morey ascribed the strong affection that artists had for the company to "the unique family atmosphere engendered by the company's direct descent from its creators, Gilbert, Sullivan ... Richard D'Oyly Carte, followed by his widow, Helen, his son Rupert, and finally his granddaughter Bridget."&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The company also preserved, for over a century, what ''The Times'' called a "unique performance style, which may be summarised as a combination of good taste and good fun".&lt;ref name=Leonard/&gt;

[[File:DOCplanter.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Planter in front of the [[Savoy Hotel]] honouring the Carte family and colleagues]]
After the 1979 tour, the rising costs of mounting year-round professional light opera without any government support, despite some generous private contributions, caused the company to accrue increasing losses.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  in 1980, the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|English Arts Council]]'s Music Panel and Touring Committee recommended that the Arts Council make a grant to the company, but this idea was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  The company's fans made an effort to raise private funds, but these were insufficient to make up the accelerating losses.  In 1981, producer George Walker proposed to film the company performing all of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas but backed out.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;  Bridget D'Oyly Carte was forced to close the company in 1982, after a final London season in which John Reed and [[Valerie Masterson]] returned as guest artists.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;  It gave its last performance on 27 February 1982, at the [[Adelphi Theatre]].

==Revivals of the company==
Dame Bridget D’Oyly Carte died in 1985, leaving in her will a £1 million legacy to enable the company to be revived.  The company secured sponsorship from [[Michael Bishop (businessman)|Sir Michael Bishop]], who later became chairman of the board of trustees, the [[Birmingham]] City Council and [[BMI (airline)|BMI]] British Midland Airways (of which Bishop is chairman).  [[Richard Condon (impresario)|Richard Condon]] was appointed the revived company's first general manager, and [[Bramwell Tovey]] was its first musical director.&lt;ref name=Bradley53&gt;Bradley (2005), pp. 53–54 and 63&lt;/ref&gt;  In succeeding seasons, the company's productions of ''The Mikado'' and ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' were nominated for [[Olivier Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisle, Nicola. "When the wheels came off the Carte", ''Classical Music'', 17 February 2007, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1988 to 2003, the company mounted productions of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas on tour and in London, and it produced several operettas by [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]], [[Franz Lehár|Lehár]] and [[Johann Strauss II|Strauss]].  Unlike the original company, which had regularly performed up to a dozen operas each year, 48 weeks a year, the new company generally presented only one or two operas in shorter seasons.&lt;ref name=Bradley53/&gt; In the first season, in 1988, the operas played were ''Iolanthe'' and ''The Yeomen of the Guard'', both starring [[Gillian Knight]].  The company made its debut at the [[Sunderland Empire Theatre]] on 29 April 1988, and, after touring, opened in London at the [[Cambridge Theatre]] in July.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Richard. "lolanthe", ''The Guardian'', 2 May 1988, p. 20; and Canning, Hugh. ''Cambridge Theatre&amp;nbsp;– Iolanthe",  ''The Guardian'', 14 July 1988, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The press notices were good, particularly about the musical aspects of the new company; opinion was divided about the staging. ''The Observer'' thought the productions "miles superior to the later work of the old D'Oyly Carte; better designed, better lit ... better played and better sung."&lt;ref&gt;Ratcliffe, Michael. "Through a glass darkly", ''The Observer'', 17 July 1988, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''The Guardian'' praised the musical standards, but added, "Gilbert and Sullivan is as much theatrical as musical entertainment and there remains a lot to be done on the visual side."&lt;ref&gt;Canning, Hugh. ''Cambridge Theatre&amp;nbsp;– Iolanthe",  ''The Guardian'', 14 July 1988, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

"Pulsating pirate version", ''The Observer'', 16 April 1989, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990 the company presented campier versions of ''Pinafore'' and ''Trial'' (including a heavily pregnant Angelina) that were much criticised by the old company's fans, who complained that it was a betrayal of the legacy left by Bridget D'Oyly Carte.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;  The next season departed further from earnest presentations in its production of ''The Gondoliers'', which included a deeply corrugated stage floor, "startling", "surreal, primary coloured, starkly angled sets", gimmicky distracting business and generally staging that was considered "way over the top".  It "was unveiled to storms of outraged booing".&lt;ref name=canning&gt;Canning, Hugh.

Another initiative was to stage a foreign operetta for the first time since Richard D'Oyly Carte's day, in what would be D'Oyly Carte's first co-production. The work chosen was  ''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]'', which [[Opera North]] presented in 1992 and D'Oyly Carte toured in 1993 as part of its 35-week tour celebrating the 150th anniversary of Sullivan's birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:LTIB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F91F07EE4EC7163&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=1026E0A26AB6F6FF  "Going down&amp;nbsp;– Arts Briefing"].

Unlike its predecessor, the new company was not a permanent ensemble with a recognisable style.&lt;ref name=Bradley61/&gt; Some performers appeared in several productions, but each production was cast anew, often with guest stars from British television in leading roles, with varying degrees of success.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Michael Billington (critic)|Billington, Michael]].

''[[The Guardian]]'', 2 July 2002, accessed 6 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The chorus and orchestra of the new company were much smaller than those of the old company: the chorus was reduced from 32 (or more) to 20, and the orchestra from 38 generally to 24.&lt;ref name=Bradley62/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See D'Oyly Carte programme booklets from Sadler's Wells 1977–78 season and the Savoy Theatre 2002 season.&lt;/ref&gt;  For a 1998 production of ''Pirates'' at the [[Queen's Theatre]], the orchestra was even smaller:  ''The Guardian'' wrote, "The goings-on in the pit are dispiriting. Budgetary constraints have forced the company to re-write the score for a band of nine instrumentalists. They play well enough, but every one of Sullivan's parodies loses its clout."&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, Tim. "Tattered and tired Pirates", ''The Guardian,'' 30 December 1998, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  The company received a modest Arts Council grant in 1997 to keep it afloat and turned to private funding from [[Raymond Gubbay]] for London seasons beginning in 1998.  Despite the lean forces, the company received generally favourable reviews over the next five years under the management of Ian Martin.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), pp. 63–67&lt;/ref&gt; Although the new company's productions met with mixed reviews, some of its recordings have been well received.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Shepherd, Marc.

From May to July 2013, [[Scottish Opera]] produced a British touring production of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' in partnership with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, although it was not reported what role the latter company took in the producing team. [[Richard Suart]] played Major-General Stanley and [[Nicholas Sharratt]] played Frederic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131022073413/http://www.scottishopera.org.uk/sites/default/files/pdf/FINAL%20Scottish%20Opera%20Sails%20Into%20Town%20On%20Pirate%20Adventure.pdf "Scottish Opera Sails into Town on ''Pirates'' Adventure"], Scottish Opera, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Daily Telegraph'', ''The Guardian'' and ''The Times'' each gave the production three out of five stars.&lt;ref&gt;Nickalls, Susan.

==Principal performers==
[[File:George Grossmith as Bunthorne, Patience, 1881.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[George Grossmith]] as Bunthorne in ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'']]Gilbert and Sullivan aficionados frequently use the names of the principal comedians of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company to refer to time periods of the company's history.&lt;ref name=Wilsonpassim&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, after the sudden death of Sullivan's brother Fred, who had created the role of the Learned Judge in ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' in 1875, the unknown [[George Grossmith]] was recruited in 1877.  Before Grossmith left the company in 1889, he created the principal comic roles in nine of the operas, and so the principal comedian parts in the operas are often referred to as the "Grossmith" roles.&lt;ref name=Wilsonpassim/&gt; Other performers who created a long series of roles in the original productions of the operas included [[baritone]] [[Rutland Barrington]], [[mezzo-soprano]] [[Jessie Bond]], [[soprano]] [[Leonora Braham]], [[contralto]] [[Rosina Brandram]], [[tenor]] [[Durward Lely]] and [[bass-baritone]] [[Richard Temple (opera singer)|Richard Temple]].  In the original New York City productions and British touring productions, soprano [[Geraldine Ulmar]], baritone [[Signor Brocolini]], comic [[George Thorne (actor)|George Thorne]] and bass-baritone [[Fred Billington]] became particularly well known.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, pp. 19–46&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Passmore as Grand Duke Rudolph 1896.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Walter Passmore|Passmore]] as Rudolph in ''[[The Grand Duke]]'']]
After Grossmith left the company, the most notable players of his roles during the rest of Gilbert's lifetime were [[Walter Passmore]] (principal comedian from 1894 to 1903) and [[Charles H. Workman]], who played the roles on tour with the company from 1897 and took over as principal comedian at the Savoy between 1906 and 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, pp. 59–87&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these performers made recordings of songs from the [[Savoy operas]].  During the Passmore era, principal players of the company included Brandram and Barrington, as well as tenor [[Robert Evett]], soprano [[Isabel Jay]], sopranos [[Ruth Vincent]] and [[Florence St. John]], tenor [[Courtice Pounds]] and his sister, mezzo-soprano [[Louie Pounds]].  During Workman's tenure, principal players included contralto [[Louie René]], soprano [[Clara Dow]], [[Leo Sheffield]], and a young [[Henry Lytton]].  No complete recordings of the operas were made that included active members of the Company until the 1920s.  Workman and W. S. Gilbert quarrelled over their production of ''[[Fallen Fairies]]'' in 1909, and Gilbert banned Workman from appearing in his works in Britain.  It is likely that, otherwise, Workman would have continued as principal comedian of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Roderick.  "A review of ''Lytton&amp;nbsp;– Gilbert and Sullivan's Jester'' by Brian Jones" in ''The Gaiety'' (Summer, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]] wrote to Workman in 1919 asking him to return to the company as principal comedian, but Workman declined.&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, Paul. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/fallen_fairies/cast.html ''Fallen Fairies'' cast information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001175342/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/fallen_fairies/cast.html |date=1 October 2009 }} at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 19 March 2005, accessed 4 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1909 to 1934, the principal comedian was Henry Lytton, who had been playing a variety of roles with the company steadily since 1887.  He received a knighthood for his performances during his long tenure with the company.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;  Lytton's voice deteriorated during his later career, and when HMV embarked on a series of complete recordings of the operas after World War I, Lytton was not invited to record most of his roles.  Instead, the concert singer [[George Baker (record singer)|George Baker]] was brought in to substitute.  Other performers from this period include mezzo-soprano [[Nellie Briercliffe]], bass-baritone [[Darrell Fancourt]], who is estimated to have portrayed the Mikado of Japan more than 3,000 times, contralto [[Bertha Lewis]], tenor [[Derek Oldham]], soprano [[Elsie Griffin]] and baritones Leo Sheffield and [[Sydney Granville]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, pp. 90–112&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Lytton In An Advertisement for The Emerald Isle in The Sketch April 24 1901.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Henry Lytton]], 1901]]
Lytton was succeeded in 1934 by [[Martyn Green]], who played the principal comic parts until 1951, except for a gap from the end of 1939 to 1946, when [[Grahame Clifford]] replaced him.  Green's time with the company is remembered for the early Decca recordings of the operas.  During Green's tenure, in addition to the long-serving Fancourt, principal players included baritone [[Richard Walker (singer)|Richard Walker]], soprano [[Helen Roberts]], mezzo-soprano [[Marjorie Eyre]], baritone [[Leslie Rands]] and contralto [[Ella Halman]].  Green was followed by [[Peter Pratt]].  He left the company in 1959, after more than eight years as principal comedian, still only 36 years old.  During Pratt's years, principals included bass-baritone [[Donald Adams]], tenor [[Leonard Osborn]] (who later directed the productions), contralto [[Ann Drummond-Grant]] and mezzo-soprano [[Joyce Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 176–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt's successor was [[John Reed (actor)|John Reed]], who served as principal comedian for two decades.&lt;ref name=Wilson178/&gt;  Other stars from this era were [[Thomas Round]], [[Donald Adams]], [[Gillian Knight]], [[Valerie Masterson]] and [[Kenneth Sandford]], all of whom, except the last, left the company for the wider operatic stage of [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]], [[English National Opera]], [[Aix-en-Provence Festival|Aix-en-Provence]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), pp. 311–43&lt;/ref&gt;  When Reed left the company in 1979, his understudy [[James Conroy-Ward]] took over until the closure of the company in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1988, the revived company used guest artists for each production.  The most regularly seen principal comedians were Eric Roberts and Richard Suart, both of whom regularly perform the "Grossmith" roles for other opera companies.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Arthur. "D'Oyly Carte", ''The Musical Times'', September 1988, p. 471&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have included [[Sam Kelly]], [[Jasper Carrott]] and Simon Butteriss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doylycarte.org.uk/News/Recent_Reviews.htm "Reviews"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426095805/http://doylycarte.org.uk/News/Recent_Reviews.htm |date=26 April 2009 }}, D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, accessed 6 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, [[Flanders and Swann]] wrote a song called "In the D'Oyly Cart", a satire of the company and the rote "business" and gestures that it was accused of repeating.

"'''De Patre Vostro (About Your Father)'''" is the series finale of the television series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]''. It is the tenth episode of the second season and 22nd overall. It originally aired on March 25, 2007.

==Plot summary==
After losing the [[Battle of Actium]], a vanquished [[Mark Antony (Rome character)|Mark Antony]] barricades himself with [[Cleopatra (Rome character)|Cleopatra]] in their palace in [[Alexandria]].   The palace becomes a place of endless debauchery as Mark Antony and Cleopatra host orgies while drugging and drinking themselves into a stupor. [[Gaius Octavian (Rome character)|Octavian]] sends an emissary to Mark Antony, with a secret message to [[Lucius Vorenus (Rome character)|Lucius Vorenus]], offering him amnesty if he will betray Antony and open the palace gates in an attempt to avoid a direct assault on the palace which might lead to a popular uprising.  It is made clear that [[Titus Pullo (Rome character)|Titus Pullo]] is aware that Caesarion is his son and that Vorenus also knows this.  Mark Antony refuses Octavian's offer of unconditional surrender and challenges Octavian to single combat.  Vorenus also refuses to betray Mark Antony. Meanwhile, Mark Antony's physical condition continues to deteriorate along with his mental condition. When he spars with Vorenus, he is easily defeated. When a bystander accidentally laughs, Antony is enraged. He then challenges the bystander, quickly killing him.

Octavian refuses the challenge as barbaric and secretly sends word to Cleopatra offering her the chance to keep the crown of Egypt and save the lives of her children if she gives up Mark Antony.  She tricks Mark Antony into believing that she has committed suicide.  Vorenus assists in Antony's suicide at his request. Vorenus, shocked to find Cleopatra still alive, tells her that Octavian will keep Mark Antony's children alive as a popular gesture of mercy but will almost certainly kill [[Caesarion (Rome character)|Caesarion]] as a potential rival to the rule of Rome; he also reveals his final orders from Mark Antony to escape with Caesarion to keep the boy alive.  It is made clear that Cleopatra knows that Caesarion is actually Titus Pullo's son.

Upon meeting Octavian and failing to seduce him as she had Mark Antony, Cleopatra realizes that he wishes to take her kingdom and parade her, alive but in chains, in Rome at his [[Roman triumph|triumph]].  She commits suicide by clasping an asp to her breast, and as Octavian's soldiers storm her throne room, she dies, telling Octavian with her final breaths, "You have a rotten soul".

Vorenus has meanwhile escaped the palace with Caesarion and Titus Pullo is charged by Octavian with finding and killing Caesarion.  Vorenus and Pullo meet near where they had previously saved Cleopatra's life in the first season and they discuss plans to escape Egypt. At a Roman roadblock they appear to pass until a guard recognizes Caesarion and mocks him. Caesarion responds in anger revealing his true identity and a fight ensues. Although they manage to fight their way out, Vorenus is seriously (perhaps mortally) wounded.  He demands that Titus Pullo take him to Rome to die.

In Rome, Octavian arrives at his mother's house, bringing with him Cleopatra and Mark Antony's twin children, Cleopatra Selene and Alexander Helios who he asks [[Octavia of the Julii|Octavia]] to take under her care. [[Atia of the Julii|Atia]] takes the news of Antony's death with satisfaction, but takes little pleasure in her son's success in at last gaining supreme power; [[Octavia of the Julii|Octavia]] is disturbed by Atia's mood.

After a month-long journey, a badly injured Vorenus and Pullo return to Rome for an emotional reunion at the Collegium.  On his sickbed, Vorenus is reconciled with his grieving children. Series creator Bruno Heller later revealed that Vorenus did not die after this scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/heller-looking-movie-version-rome-123654|title=Heller looking for movie version of 'Rome'|website=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Octavian's triumph is taking place.  As [[Livia (Rome character)|Livia]] and Octavia are about to enter a podium in the Forum, late arrival Atia takes the lead, calling Livia a "vicious little trollop," and says, "You're swearing now that some day you will destroy me, but remember that far better women than you have sworn to do the same. Go look for them now."&lt;ref&gt;Referring to [[Servilia of the Junii|Servilia]], for example, and to Livia's future murderous ambition that her son will succeed Augustus, known to TV audiences from ''[[I, Claudius (tv series)|I, Claudius]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Atia's look, however, is ambiguous as she watches a triumphal float pass by with the effigies of Mark Anthony and Cleopatra, her lost love and his seducer, as glances are exchanged between Agrippa and Octavia.

A month later, Pullo pays Octavian a visit, lying to him about the fate of Caesarion and is rewarded.  He also tells him that Vorenus didn't survive his injuries without giving details on how they were inflicted.  Leaving Octavian's palace, he meets Caesarion who begins swearing revenge in his wish to claim his rightful throne as Caesar's heir, "redeeming my father's name!"

The series ends with the pair disappearing into a crowded Roman street as Titus Pullo puts his arm around Caesarion and says "Listen, about your father..."

==Cultural references and continuity==
* Akin to Caesar's death in the previous season, Mark Antony is depicted as covering his face when he is grieving over the "death" of Cleopatra.
* Since the real Atia had died in 43 BC, her presence at the triumph of Octavian is fictional.

==Ratings==
The series finale of ''Rome'' was watched by 2.4 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/ratings/2007/03/29/cable-ratings-round-up-week-of-march-19-25-earth-big-for-discovery-24036/7340/|title=Cable Ratings Round-Up (Week of March 19–25): 'Earth' Big for Discovery|work=The Futon Critic|date=March 29, 2007|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the season premiere, this is the only episode in the second season with known viewership numbers.

'''''Everybody's Talking About Jamie''''' is a 2017 musical with music by [[Dan Gillespie Sells]] and book and lyrics by [[Tom MacRae]]. The musical is inspired by the 2011 [[BBC Three]] documentary ''Jamie: Drag Queen at 16''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/14/everybodys-talking-about-jamie-review-crucible-sheffield-the-feeling|title=Everybody's Talking About Jamie review – drag musical from the Feeling frontman|last=Billington|first=Michael|date=14 February 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=20 April 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

=== Act One ===
Miss Hedge, a careers teacher, asks her noisy [[Year Eleven|year eleven]] class what they want to be when they get older. One student of the class, Jamie New, gets teased about his [[homosexuality]], and reveals to the audience all he wants to be is a [[drag queen]] ("And You Don't Even Know It"). When prompted, Jamie tells the class he wants to be a performer, but Miss Hedge tells him to get real.

At Jamie's house, his mum Margaret and family friend Ray are preparing for his sixteenth birthday. When Jamie arrives home, Margaret gives him a card from his dad, with a picture of a race car. Margaret then gives Jamie his gift from her - a pair of red [[High-heeled footwear|high heels]]. Jamie reveals hesitation about going outside his garden in the shoes ("Wall In My Head").

The next day at school, Jamie shows his best friend, Pritti, his new heels, before being interrupted by Dean, the school bully. He taunts Pritti for being [[Muslim]], and Jamie for being gay. Jamie taunts Dean for his small penis in return. Embarrassed, Dean leaves. Pritti encourages Jamie to go to prom in a dress ("Spotlight"). Jamie then parades around the classroom in his heels ("Spotlight (Reprise) (Star of the Show)").

At his local drag queen attire shop, Victor's Secret, Jamie befriends the owner, Hugo, and learns all about Hugo's drag queen past ("The Legend of Loco Chanelle (And The Blood Red Dress)"). Hugo books Jamie's first drag show at the local nightclub, and helps Jamie choose his dress ("The Legend of Loco Chanelle (And The Blood Red Dress) (Reprise)").

Meanwhile, Margaret meets up with Jamie's Dad, where she reveals she's been lying to Jamie about the activity of his dad, including the fact she has to write a birthday card from him each birthday. Jamie's Dad tells Margaret he wants nothing to do with Jamie, claiming he's not a 'real boy'. Margaret ponders what her life would be like if she never met Jamie's Dad ("If I Met Myself Again").

At school, Jamie pulls Pritti into a disabled toilet so she can help with his make-up. They are discovered by Miss Hedge, but Pritti tells her that she is doing Jamie's make-up for an art project. Miss Hedge tells Jamie that he should be proud of being an art project, and walks him around school in the make-up. Jamie, initially embarrassed by the attention, decides to be proud of himself, telling the school that he's doing a drag show at the local nightclub, Legs Eleven, that night ("Work of Art").

Outside Legs Eleven, Jamie bumps into Dean, who calls him a [[Minger (slang)|minger]]. Inside the club, Margaret and Ray have been introduced to a group of drag queens: Laika Virgin, Tray Sophisticay, and Sandra Bollock. Hugo emerges, now dressed as Loco Chanelle, his drag alter-ego. Jamie runs in and tells them all he can't go on because of what Dean said. Jamie finds the dress he admired at Victor's Secret in his dressing room, with a tag on saying 'Love Dad', as well as a flower delivery from Jamie's Dad. Loco Chanelle, with the help of the other drag queens, encourage Jamie to find his drag self, whom Jamie calls 'Mimi Me', and get him ready and push him onstage ("Over The Top")

=== Act Two ===
The next day, the school is buzzing with news of Jamie's drag debut ("Everybody's Talking About Jamie"). Jamie comes into school in bright blue [[Eye shadow|eyeshadow]] and long eyelashes. Miss Hedge once again tells Jamie to 'get real', and Dean taunts Jamie, but Jamie kisses him in retaliation. Jamie leaves Dean confused.

At home, Jamie shows Margaret and Ray his new [[Prom|prom dress]], fit with working flashing lights. Margaret worries if this is all too much ("Limited Edition Prom Night Special"). The phone rings, and Jamie and Margaret are called to the school.

Jamie, Margaret and Ray go to the school to meet with Miss Hedge, who tells Jamie that there have been rumours that he will be attending prom in drag, and she will not allow it. Jamie is disappointed, and Dean seems to know all about it.

In Pritti's bedroom, Jamie rants to Pritti about how he's not allowed to go to prom in drag. Pritti tells Jamie to go in a dress - not in drag. Jamie says that without Mimi Me, he's ugly. Pritti reassures Jamie that he is far from ugly ("It Means Beautiful"). Jamie reveals that when he was eight, his dad found him in a dress and was angry. He's then confused as to why he paid for the dress and bought flowers if he's not supportive of him as a drag queen. Pritti suggests Jamie should go to his house and speak to him. Before he leaves, Jamie kisses Pritti on the cheek ("It Means Beautiful (Reprise)").

At Jamie's Dad's house, Jamie's Dad reveals that he didn't know about Mimi Me and calls Jamie disgusting. He tells Jamie he didn't pay for the dress or flowers. Jamie figures out that it was his mother doing all of this in his dad's place ("Ugly In This Ugly World").

At home, Jamie argues with Margaret over why she has been lying over all these years. Jamie screams in Margaret's face and storms out. Margaret, left alone, sings about how she will always love Jamie no matter what ("He's My Boy").

Jamie wanders the streets drunk on cider. He is approached by three local boys, and is beaten up as they shout [[Homophobia|homophobic remarks]] about him. ("And You Don't Even Know It (Bus Station Reprise)"). Jamie is defended by Hugo, who urges Jamie to go home and apologise to his mum.

Jamie takes Hugo's advice and Margaret and Jamie apologise to each other ("My Man, Your Boy").

At the prom, all of the kids are super excited ("Prom Song"). Pritti enters, wearing makeup and a prom dress. All the girls love it, but Dean decides to bully her. She finally stands up to Dean, and then reveals Jamie, in a white prom dress. Miss Hedge comes out of the school and refuses Jamie's admission to the prom. All the kids stand outside and chant Jamie's name until Miss Hedge gives in and lets him in. Jamie waits until everyone's gone in, and then calls Dean out from off-stage. Jamie encourages Dean to be nice just for one night, to which Dean agrees, and they walk into prom hand-in-hand ("Finale").

As an [[encore]], the cast perform "Out Of The Darkness (A Place Where We Belong)".

== Critical reception ==
The musical received generally positive reviews.

[[Ann Treneman]] of ''[[The Times]]'' commenting after its West End run had been confirmed exclaimed "I gave it a very rare five stars. The moment it ended the entire audience rose up as one. I think that it has such an impact for the same reason that ''[[Dear Evan Hansen]]'', the musical that just cleaned up the [[Tony Awards]] in [[New York City|New York]], is such a success." Later stating that "This is hit material and it so deserved a chance to strut its stuff in [[Shaftesbury Avenue]]. Now its got it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/everybodys-talking-about-jamie-bfblhvk63|title=Everybody’s Talking About Jamie|first=Ann|last=Treneman|date=24 June 2017|publisher=|via=www.thetimes.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clare Brennan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that "the drama lacks oomph but sheer exuberance carries this coming-of-age tale...That said, this is still a touching, funny and joyous production."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/19/everybodys-talking-about-jamie-crucible-sheffield-review|title=Everybody’s Talking About Jamie review – joyous teen drag musical|last=Brennan|first=Clare|date=19 February 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=20 April 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominic Cavendish, in his four-star review in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', stated "I can’t think of a musical that has set me spinning right round (like a record, baby) quite as much as this funny, outrageous, touching but oh-my-word PC flag-waving show...The show sends you out on a feel-good bubble of happiness. Think about it too much, though, and the bubble gets pricked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/everybodys-talking-jamie-sheffield-crucible-review/|title=Sends you out on a feel-good bubble of happiness - Everybody’s Talking About Jamie review|work=The Telegraph|access-date=20 April 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Shenton]] of ''[[The Stage]]'' thought highly of the show, commenting "Everybody should soon be talking about ''Everybody's Talking About Jamie''. This new British musical is by turns courageous and outrageous."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2017/everybodys-talking-jamie-review-sheffield-crucible/|title=Everybody’s Talking About Jamie review at Sheffield Crucible|work=The Stage|access-date=20 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Termination of a taxon by the death of the last member}}
{{Conservation status}}
{{Evolutionary biology}}
In [[biology]], '''extinction''' is the termination of an [[organism]] or of a group of organisms ([[taxon]]), normally a [[species]]. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the [[endling|last individual]] of the species, although the [[Functional extinction|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point. Because a species' potential [[Range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where a species presumed extinct abruptly "reappears" (typically in the [[fossil|fossil record]]) after a period of apparent absence.

Through [[evolution]], species arise through the process of [[speciation]]—where new varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]]—and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.

A species is extinct when the last existing member dies. Extinction therefore becomes a certainty when there are no surviving individuals that can reproduce and create a new generation. A species may become [[functional extinction|functionally extinct]] when only a handful of individuals survive, which cannot reproduce due to poor health, age, sparse distribution over a large range, a lack of individuals of both sexes (in [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] species), or other reasons.

Pinpointing the extinction (or [[pseudoextinction]]) of a species requires a [[Theory of species|clear definition of that species]]. If it is to be declared extinct, the species in question must be uniquely distinguishable from any ancestor or daughter species, and from any other closely related species. Extinction of a species (or replacement by a daughter species) plays a key role in the [[punctuated equilibrium]] hypothesis of [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Niles Eldredge, ''Time Frames: Rethinking of Darwinian Evolution and the Theory of Punctuated Equilibria'', 1986, Heinemann {{ISBN|0-434-22610-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Various dinosaurs.png|thumb|left|Skeleton of various extinct [[dinosaur]]s; some other dinosaur lineages still flourish in the form of [[birds]]]]
In [[ecology]], ''extinction'' is often used informally to refer to [[local extinction]], in which a species ceases to exist in the chosen area of study, but may still exist elsewhere. This phenomenon is also known as extirpation. Local extinctions may be followed by a replacement of the species taken from other locations; [[wolf reintroduction]] is an example of this. Species which are not extinct are termed [[Extant taxon|extant]]. Those that are extant but threatened by extinction are referred to as [[threatened]] or [[endangered species]].

[[File:Edwards' Dodo.jpg|thumb|The [[dodo]] of [[Mauritius]], shown here in a 1626 illustration by [[Roelant Savery]], is an often-cited example of [[Holocene extinction|modern extinction]]&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite book | last = Diamond | first = Jared | authorlink = Jared Diamond | title = [[Guns, Germs, and Steel]] | publisher = [[W. W. Norton]]|year = 1999| isbn = 0-393-31755-2 | pages=43–44 |chapter=Up to the Starting Line }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Currently an important aspect of extinction is human attempts to preserve critically endangered species. These are reflected by the creation of the [[conservation status]] [[extinct in the wild|"extinct in the wild" (EW)]]. Species listed under this status by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) are not known to have any living specimens in the wild, and are maintained only in [[zoo]]s or other artificial environments. Some of these species are functionally extinct, as they are no longer part of their natural habitat and it is unlikely the species will ever be restored to the wild.&lt;ref name="Maas"&gt;Maas, Peter. "[http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/wilduk.htm Extinct in the Wild" ''The Extinction Website''. URL accessed January 26 2007.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216030551/http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/wilduk.htm |date=February 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When possible, modern [[zoology|zoological]] institutions try to maintain a [[viable population]] for species preservation and possible future [[reintroduction]] to the wild, through use of carefully planned [[breeding program]]s.

The extinction of one species' wild population can have knock-on effects, causing further extinctions. These are also called "chains of extinction".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://theory.ph.man.ac.uk/~ajm/qui05a.pdf |title=Deleting species from model food webs |accessdate=2007-02-15 |format=PDF |work= |author=Quince, C. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060925092540/http://theory.ph.man.ac.uk/~ajm/qui05a.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-09-25|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially common with extinction of [[keystone species]].

A new study suggests that it could take up to 5 to 7 million years for mammal diversity to be restored to its state prior to the arrival of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mammal-diversity-extinction-study_us_5bc59f68e4b055bc94796ecf|title=Mammals Will Still Be Recovering From Human Destruction Long After We're Gone|last=Mosbergen|first=Dominique|date=2018-10-16|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pseudoextinction ===
{{Main|Pseudoextinction}}

Extinction of a parent species where daughter species or subspecies are still extant is called pseudoextinction or phyletic extinction. Effectively, the old taxon vanishes, transformed ([[anagenesis]]) into a successor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Michael |last2=Mulligan |first2=Pamela |last3=Stansfield |first3=William |title=A Dictionary of Genetics |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; or split into more than one ([[cladogenesis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Leighton |first=Lindsey R. |title=Taxon Characteristics That Promote Survivorship Through the Permian-Triassic Interval: Transition from the Paleozoic to the Mesozoic Brachiopod Fauna  |journal=Paleobiology |date=2009 |volume=34 |pages=65–79 |doi=10.1666/06082.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudoextinction is difficult to demonstrate unless one has a strong chain of evidence linking a living species to members of a pre-existing species. For example, it is sometimes claimed that the extinct ''[[Hyracotherium]]'', which was an early horse that shares a common ancestor with the modern [[horse]], is pseudoextinct, rather than extinct, because there are several extant species of ''[[Equus (genus)|Equus]]'', including [[zebra]] and [[donkey]]. However, as fossil species typically leave no genetic material behind, one cannot say whether ''Hyracotherium'' [[Evolution of the horse|evolved into more modern horse species]] or merely evolved from a common ancestor with modern horses. Pseudoextinction is much easier to demonstrate for larger taxonomic groups.

===Lazarus taxa===
{{Main|Lazarus taxa}}
The [[coelacanth]], a fish related to [[lungfish]] and [[tetrapod]]s, was considered to have been extinct since the end of the [[Cretaceous Period]] until 1938 when a specimen was found, off the [[Chalumna River]] (now Tyolomnqa) on the east coast of South Africa.&lt;ref name="dinofish"&gt;[http://www.dinofish.com/discoa.htm "Discovery" of the Coelacanth]&lt;/ref&gt; Museum curator [[Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer]] discovered the fish among the catch of a local angler, Captain Hendrick Goosen, on December 23, 1938.&lt;ref name="dinofish" /&gt; A local chemistry professor, [[James Leonard Brierley Smith|JLB Smith]], confirmed the fish's importance with a famous cable: "MOST IMPORTANT PRESERVE SKELETON AND GILLS = FISH DESCRIBED".&lt;ref name="dinofish" /&gt;

Far more recent possible or presumed extinctions of species which may turn out still to exist include the thylacine, or [[Tasmanian tiger]] (''Thylacinus cynocephalus''), the last known example of which died in Hobart Zoo in Tasmania in 1936; the [[Honshū wolf|Japanese wolf]] (''Canis lupus hodophilax''), last sighted over 100 years ago; the [[ivory-billed woodpecker]] (''Campephilus principalis''), last sighted for certain in 1944; and the [[slender-billed curlew]] (''Numenius tenuirostris''), not seen since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/2013/02/21/4-extinct-species-hope-rediscover/ 4 Extinct species that people still hope to rediscover – John R.

[[File:Ectopistes migratoriusMCN2P28CA.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[passenger pigeon]], one of hundreds of species of extinct birds, was hunted to extinction over the course of a few decades]]

As long as species have been evolving, species have been going extinct. It is estimated that over 99.9% of all species that ever lived are extinct. The average lifespan of a species is 1–10 million years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Conservation of Wildlife Populations: Demography, Genetics and Management|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fVLEV64qYfcC|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|date = 2009-03-12|isbn = 9781444308938|language = en|first = L. Scott|last = Mills|page = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this varies widely between taxa.
There are a variety of causes that can contribute directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species. "Just as each species is unique", write Beverly and [[Stephen C. Stearns]], "so is each extinction&amp;nbsp;... the causes for each are varied—some subtle and complex, others obvious and simple".&lt;ref name="Stearns"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stearns | first = Beverly Peterson and Stephen C. | title = Watching, from the Edge of Extinction | publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-300-08469-2 | pages=x |chapter=Preface }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most simply, any species that cannot [[Survival skills|survive]] and [[reproduction|reproduce]] in its environment and cannot move to a new environment where it can do so, dies out and becomes extinct. Extinction of a species may come suddenly when an otherwise healthy species is wiped out completely, as when [[toxic]] [[pollution]] renders its entire [[habitat]] unliveable; or may occur gradually over thousands or millions of years, such as when a species gradually loses out in competition for food to better adapted competitors. Extinction may occur a long time after the events that set it in motion, a phenomenon known as [[extinction debt]].

Assessing the relative importance of genetic factors compared to environmental ones as the causes of extinction has been compared to the debate on [[nature and nurture]].&lt;ref name="Raup"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raup |first=David M. |author2=J.

When concerns about [[human extinction]] have been raised, for example in Sir [[Martin Rees]]' 2003 book ''[[Our Final Hour]]'', those concerns lie with the effects of [[climate change]] or [[technology|technological]] disaster.

Currently, environmental groups and some governments are concerned with the extinction of species caused by humanity, and they try to prevent further extinctions through a variety of [[conservation movement|conservation]] programs.&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt; Humans can cause extinction of a species through [[overharvesting]], [[pollution]], [[habitat destruction]], introduction of [[invasive species]] (such as new [[predator]]s and food [[competitors]]), overhunting, and other influences.

=== Genetics and demographic phenomena ===
{{See also|Extinction vortex|Genetic erosion|Mutational meltdown}}
If [[adaptation]] increasing population [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] is slower than environmental degradation plus the accumulation of slightly deleterious [[mutation]]s, then a population will go extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bertram|first1=J|last2=Gomez|first2=K|last3=Masel|first3=J|title=Predicting patterns of long-term adaptation and extinction with population genetics|journal=Evolution|date=February 2017|volume=71|issue=2|pages=204–214|doi=10.1111/evo.13116|arxiv=1605.08717}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller populations have fewer beneficial mutations entering the population each generation, slowing adaptation. It is also easier for slightly deleterious mutations to [[fixation (population genetics)|fix]] in small populations; the resulting positive feedback loop between small population size and low fitness can cause [[mutational meltdown]].

Limited geographic range is the most important determinant of [[genus]] extinction at background rates but becomes increasingly irrelevant as [[#Mass extinctions|mass extinction]] arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Payne, J.L.  |author2=S. Finnegan | year=2007 | title=The effect of geographic range on extinction risk during background and mass extinction | journal=[[PNAS|Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.]] | volume=104 | issue=25 | pages=10506–11 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0701257104 | pmid=17563357| pmc=1890565|bibcode = 2007PNAS..10410506P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited geographic range is a cause both of small population size and of greater vulnerability to local environmental catastrophes.

Extinction rates can be affected not just by population size, but by any factor that affects [[evolvability]], including [[balancing selection]], [[cryptic genetic variation]], [[phenotypic plasticity]], and [[robustness (evolution)|robustness]]. A diverse or deep [[gene pool]] gives a population a higher chance in the short term of surviving an adverse change in conditions. Effects that cause or reward a loss in [[genetic diversity]] can increase the chances of extinction of a species. [[Population bottleneck]]s can dramatically reduce genetic diversity by severely limiting the number of reproducing individuals and make [[inbreeding]] more frequent.

=== Habitat degradation ===
{{Main|Habitat destruction}}
Habitat degradation is currently the main anthropogenic cause of species extinctions. The main cause of habitat degradation worldwide is agriculture, with urban sprawl, logging, mining and some fishing practices close behind. The degradation of a species' [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] may alter the [[fitness landscape]] to such an extent that the species is no longer able to survive and becomes extinct. This may occur by direct effects, such as the environment becoming [[toxicity|toxic]], or indirectly, by limiting a species' ability to compete effectively for diminished resources or against new competitor species.

Habitat degradation through toxicity can kill off a species very rapidly, by killing all living members through [[contamination]] or [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] them. It can also occur over longer periods at lower toxicity levels by affecting life span, reproductive capacity, or competitiveness.

Habitat degradation can also take the form of a physical destruction of niche habitats. The widespread destruction of [[tropical rainforest]]s and replacement with open pastureland is widely cited as an example of this;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; elimination of the dense forest eliminated the infrastructure needed by many species to survive. For example, a [[fern]] that depends on dense shade for protection from direct sunlight can no longer survive without forest to shelter it. Another example is the destruction of ocean floors by [[bottom trawling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clover |first=Charles |year=2004 |title=The End of the Line: How overfishing is changing the world and what we eat |publisher=Ebury Press |location=London |isbn=0-09-189780-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diminished resources or introduction of new competitor species also often accompany habitat degradation. [[Global warming]] has allowed some species to expand their range, bringing unwelcome{{according to whom|date=May 2016}} competition to other species that previously occupied that area. Sometimes these new competitors are predators and directly affect prey species, while at other times they may merely outcompete vulnerable species for limited resources. Vital resources including [[water]] and food can also be limited during habitat degradation, leading to extinction.

[[File:Bufo periglenes2.jpg|thumb|The [[golden toad]] was last seen on May 15, 1989. [[Decline in amphibian populations]] is ongoing worldwide]]

=== Predation, competition, and disease ===
{{See also|Island restoration}}
In the natural course of events, species become extinct for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: extinction of a necessary host, prey or pollinator, inter-species competition, inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions (particularly sudden changes) which can act to introduce novel predators, or to remove prey. Recently in geological time, humans have become an additional cause of extinction (many people would say premature extinction) of some species, either as a new mega-predator or by [[introduced species|transporting]] [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s from one part of the world to another. Such introductions have been occurring for thousands of years, sometimes intentionally (e.g. [[livestock]] released by sailors on islands as a future source of food) and sometimes accidentally (e.g. [[rat]]s escaping from boats). In most cases, the introductions are unsuccessful, but when an [[Invasive species|invasive alien species]] does become established, the consequences can be catastrophic. Invasive alien species can affect [[Endemic (ecology)|native]] species directly by eating them, competing with them, and introducing [[pathogen]]s or [[parasite]]s that sicken or kill them; or indirectly by destroying or degrading their habitat. Human populations may themselves act as invasive predators. According to the "overkill hypothesis", the swift extinction of the [[megafauna]] in areas such as Australia (40,000 years before present), [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] (12,000 years before present), [[Madagascar]], [[Hawaii]] (300–1000 CE), and New Zealand (1300–1500 CE), resulted from the sudden introduction of human beings to environments full of animals that had never seen them before, and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, Anita.

=== Coextinction ===
{{Main|Coextinction}}
[[File:Giant Haasts eagle attacking New Zealand moa.jpg|thumb|The large [[Haast's eagle]] and [[moa]] from New Zealand]]

Coextinction refers to the loss of a species due to the extinction of another; for example, the extinction of [[parasitism|parasitic]] insects following the loss of their hosts. Coextinction can also occur when a species loses its [[pollinator]], or to [[predator]]s in a [[food chain]] who lose their prey. "Species coextinction is a manifestation of the interconnectedness of organisms in complex ecosystems&amp;nbsp;... While coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions, it is certainly an insidious one".&lt;ref name="Koh"&gt;Koh, Lian Pih. ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Vol 305, Issue 5690, 1632–1634, 10 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Coextinction is especially common when a [[keystone species]] goes extinct.
Models suggest that coextinction is the most common form of [[biodiversity loss]]. There may be a cascade of coextinction across the [[trophic level]]s. Such effects are most severe in [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] and parasitic relationships. An example of coextinction is the [[Haast's eagle]] and the [[moa]]: the Haast's eagle was a predator that became extinct because its food source became extinct. The moa were several species of flightless birds that were a food source for the Haast's eagle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Dunn | first = Robert |author2=Nyeema Harris|author3=Robert Colwell|author4=Lian Pin Koh|author5=Navjot Sodhi | title = Proceedings of the Royal Society | work = The sixth mass coextinction: are most endangered species parasites and mutualists? | publisher = [[The Royal Society]] | year = 2009 | url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1670/3037.short | accessdate = April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1998 survey&lt;!-- Needs updating. Survey is now 20+ years old.  --&gt; of 400 biologists conducted by [[New York City|New York]]'s [[American Museum of Natural History]], nearly 70% believed that the Earth is currently in the early stages of a human-caused mass extinction,&lt;ref name="AMNH"&gt;[[American Museum of Natural History]].

In that survey, the same proportion of respondents agreed with the prediction that up to 20% of all living populations could become extinct within 30 years (by 2028). A 2014 special edition of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' declared there is widespread consensus on the issue of human-driven mass species extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date = 25 July 2014 | title = Vanishing fauna (Special issue)|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=345|issue=6195| pages = 392–412 | url =http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/vanishing/index.xhtml?_ga=1.172413478.429831163.1471029002 |doi=10.1126/science.345.6195.392| bibcode= | last1 = Vignieri | first1 = S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist [[E. O.

For much of history, the modern understanding of extinction as the end of a [[species]] was incompatible with the prevailing worldview. Through the 18th century, much of Western society adhered to the belief that the world was created by God and as such was complete and perfect.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowland|first=Stephen|date=2009|title=Thomas Jefferson, extinction, and the evolving view of Earth history in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries|url=http://memoirs.gsapubs.org/content/203/225.abstract|journal=GSA Memoirs|volume=203|pages=225–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept reached its heyday in the 1700s with the peak popularity of a theological concept called the [[Great chain of being|Great Chain of Being]], in which all life on earth, from the tiniest microorganism to God, is linked in a continuous chain.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33224/33224-h/33224-h.htm|title=The Principles of Geology or, The Modern Changes of the Earth and its Inhabitants Considered as Illustrative of Geology|last=Lyells|first=Charles|publisher=Appleton Co|year=1854|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extinction of a species was impossible under this model, as it would create gaps or missing links in the chain and destroy the natural order.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]] was a firm supporter of the [[Great Chain of Being]] and an opponent of extinction,&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/history-of-geology/on-the-extinction-of-species/|title=On the Extinction of Species|last=Bressan|first=David|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; famously denying the extinction of the wooly mammoth on the grounds that nature never allows a race of animals to become extinct.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqHwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT88&amp;lpg=PT88&amp;dq=%22Extinction,+diversity,+and+endangerment%22+david+sepkoski&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tpA16i2uMn&amp;sig=oH9FP_N1r2swggDmOvzLzg8LH10&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitpMKv9NTTAhUh7oMKHUOaA2wQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Extinction,%20diversity,%20and%20endangerment%22%20david%20sepkoski&amp;f=false|title=Endangerment, Biodiversity and Culture|last=Vidal|first=Fernando|last2=Dias|first2=Nélia|date=2015-06-19|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317538073|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of fossils were discovered in the late 17th century that appeared unlike any living species. As a result, the scientific community embarked on a voyage of creative rationalization, seeking to understand what had happened to these species within a framework that did not account for total extinction. In October 1686, [[Robert Hooke]] presented an impression of a [[nautilus]] to the [[Royal Society]] that was more than two feet in diameter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7LriV7aZpkC&amp;pg=PA403&amp;lpg=PA403&amp;dq=hooke+nautilus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DWXg0qsaJ8&amp;sig=vUkaTNuCy8Ud9RjliZubXBdD4bM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD6rGQptXTAhUF2IMKHfamAc8Q6AEIVjAL#v=onepage&amp;q=hooke%20nautilus&amp;f=false|title=The Forgotten Genius: The Biography of Robert Hooke, 1635–1703|last=Inwood|first=Stephen|date=2005-05-03|publisher=MacAdam/Cage Publishing|isbn=9781596921153|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and morphologically distinct from any known living species. [[Robert Hooke|Hooke]] theorized that this was simply because the species lived in the deep ocean and no one had discovered them yet.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; While he contended that  it was possible a species could be "lost", he thought this highly unlikely.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Similarly, in 1695, [[Thomas Molyneux]] published an account of enormous antlers found in [[Ireland]] that did not belong to any extant taxa in that area.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molyneux|first=Thomas|date=1695-01-01|title=A Discourse Concerning the Large Horns Frequently Found under Ground in Ireland, Concluding from Them That the Great American Deer, Call'd a Moose, Was Formerly Common in That Island: With Remarks on Some Other Things Natural to That Country.

When parts of the world had not been thoroughly examined and charted, scientists could not rule out that animals found only in the fossil record were not simply "hiding" in unexplored regions of the Earth.&lt;ref name="Watson2"&gt;''Ideas: A History from Fire to Freud'' ([[Peter Watson (business writer)|Peter Watson]] Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson {{ISBN|0-297-60726-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Cuvier]] is credited with establishing the modern conception of extinction in a 1796 lecture to the [[French Institute]],&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":52"/&gt; though he would spend most of his career trying to convince the wider scientific community of his theory.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/912273245|title=Perilous planet earth : catastrophes and catastrophism through the ages|last=Trevor.|first=Palmer,|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521819288|oclc=912273245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier was a well-regarded geologist, lauded for his ability to reconstruct the anatomy of an unknown species from a few fragments of bone.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; His primary evidence for extinction came from mammoth skulls found in the [[Paris Basin|Paris basin]].&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; Cuvier recognized them as distinct from any known living species of elephant, and argued that it was highly unlikely such an enormous animal would go undiscovered.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; In 1812, Cuvier, along with [[Alexandre Brongniart|Alexandre Bronigniart]] &amp; [[Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], mapped the [[Stratum|strata]] of the Paris basin.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They saw alternating saltwater and freshwater deposits, as well as patterns of the appearance and disappearance of fossils throughout the record.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; From these patterns, Cuvier inferred historic cycles of catastrophic flooding, extinction, and repopulation of the earth with new species.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

Cuvier's fossil evidence showed that very different life forms existed in the past than those that exist today, a fact that was accepted by most scientists.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The primary debate focused whether this turnover caused by extinction was gradual or abrupt in nature.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Cuvier understood extinction to be the result of cataclysmic events that wipe out huge numbers of species, as opposed to the gradual decline of a species over time.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45730036|title=Georges Cuvier, fossil bones, and geological catastrophes : new translations &amp; interpretations of the primary texts|last=S.|first=Rudwick, M. J.|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226731063|oclc=45730036}}&lt;/ref&gt; His catastrophic view of the nature of extinction garnered him many opponents in the newly emerging school of [[uniformitarianism]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Jean-Baptist Lamarck]], a [[Gradualism|gradualist]] and colleague of Cuvier, saw the fossils of different life forms as evidence of the mutable character of species.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; While Lamarck did not deny the possibility of extinction, he believed that it was exceptional and rare and that most of the change in species over time was due to gradual change.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Unlike Cuvier, Lamarck was skeptical that catastrophic events of a scale large enough to cause total extinction were possible. In his geological history of the earth titled Hydrogeologie, Lamarck instead argued that the surface of the earth was shaped by gradual erosion and deposition by water, and that species changed over time in response to the changing environment.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/898833548|title=The age of Lamarck : evolutionary theories in France, 1790–1830|last=Renato)|first=Mandelbaum, Jonathan (Jonathan|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520058309|oclc=898833548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lyell]], a noted geologist and founder of [[uniformitarianism]], believed that past processes should be understood using present day processes. Like Lamarck, Lyell acknowledged that extinction could occur, noting the total extinction of the [[dodo]] and the extirpation of [[History of the horse in Britain|indigenous horses]] to the British Isles.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; He similarly argued against [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]], believing that any extinction must be a gradual process.&lt;ref name=":52"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Lyell also showed that Cuvier's original interpretation of the Parisian strata was incorrect. Instead of the catastrophic floods inferred by Cuvier, Lyell demonstrated that patterns of saltwater and freshwater [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]], like those seen in the [[Paris Basin|Paris basin]], could be formed by a slow rise and fall of [[sea level]]s.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

The concept of extinction was integral to [[Charles Darwin]]’s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', with less fit lineages disappearing over time. For Darwin, extinction was a constant side effect of [[Competition (biology)|competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/16/the-lost-world-2|title=The Lost World|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the wide reach of ''On the Origin of Species'', it was widely accepted that extinction occurred gradually and evenly (a concept we now refer to as [[Background extinction rate|background extinction]]).&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; It was not until 1982, when [[David M. Raup|David Raup]] and [[Jack Sepkoski]] published their seminal paper on mass extinctions, that Cuvier was vindicated and catastrophic extinction was accepted as an important mechanism. The current understanding of extinction is a synthesis of the cataclysmic extinction events proposed by Cuvier, and the background extinction events proposed by Lyell and Darwin.

== Human attitudes and interests ==
Extinction is an important research topic in the field of [[zoology]], and [[biology]] in general, and has also become an area of concern outside the scientific community. A number of organizations, such as the [[WWF (conservation organization)|Worldwide Fund for Nature]], have been created with the goal of preserving species from extinction. [[Government]]s have attempted, through enacting laws, to avoid habitat destruction, agricultural over-harvesting, and [[pollution]]. While many human-caused extinctions have been accidental, humans have also engaged in the deliberate destruction of some species, such as dangerous [[virus]]es, and the total destruction of other problematic species has been suggested.  Other species were deliberately driven to extinction, or nearly so, due to poaching or because they were "undesirable", or to push for other human agendas.  One example was the near extinction of the [[American bison]], which was nearly wiped out by mass hunts sanctioned by the United States government, to force the removal of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], many of whom relied on the bison for food.&lt;ref name="Kotzman"&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.

Biologist Bruce Walsh of the [[University of Arizona]] states three reasons for scientific interest in the preservation of species: genetic resources, ecosystem stability, and [[ethics]];&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt; and today the scientific community "stress[es] the importance" of maintaining biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;Walsh, Bruce.

In modern times, commercial and industrial interests often have to contend with the effects of production on plant and animal life. However, some technologies with minimal, or no, proven harmful effects on ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' can be devastating to wildlife (for example, [[DDT]]).&lt;ref name="INCHEM"&gt;International Programme on Chemical Safety (1989).

People who live close to nature can be dependent on the survival of all the species in their environment, leaving them highly exposed to extinction [[risk]]s. However, people prioritize day-to-day survival over species conservation; with [[human overpopulation]] in tropical [[developing country|developing countries]], there has been enormous pressure on forests due to [[subsistence agriculture]], including [[slash-and-burn]] agricultural techniques that can reduce endangered species's habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1= Anne | last1= Ehrlich | title = Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the Disappearance of Species | publisher= Random House, New York | year= 1981 | isbn= 0-394-51312-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antinatalist]] philosopher [[David Benatar]] concludes that any popular concern about non-human species extinction usually arises out of concern about how the loss of a species will impact human wants and needs, that "we shall live in a world impoverished by the loss of one aspect of faunal diversity, that we shall no longer be able to behold or use that species of animal." He notes that typical concerns about possible human extinction, such as the loss of individual members, are not considered in regards to non-human species extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Benatar|first=David|date=2008 |title=Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence|url= |location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=197 |isbn=978-0199549269|quote=It is noteworthy that human concern about human extinction takes a different form from human concern (where there is any) about the extinction of non-human species. Most humans who are concerned about the extinction of non-human species are not concerned about the individual animals whose lives are cut short in the passage to extinction, even though that is one of the best reasons to be concerned about extinction (at least in its killing form). The popular concern about animal extinction is usually concern for humans –- that we shall live in a world impoverished by the loss of one aspect of faunal diversity, that we shall no longer be able to behold or use that species of animal. In other words, none of the typical concerns about human extinction are applied to non-human species extinction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Treponema pallidum|Treponema pallidum pertenue]]'', a bacterium which causes the disease [[yaws]], is in the process of being eradicated.

Biologist [[Olivia Judson]] has advocated the deliberate extinction of certain disease-carrying [[mosquito]] species. In a September 25, 2003 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', she advocated "specicide" of thirty mosquito species by introducing a genetic element which can insert itself into another crucial gene, to create [[recessive]] "[[Gene knockout|knockout genes]]".&lt;ref name="Judson"/&gt; She says that the ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes (which spread [[malaria]]) and ''[[Aedes]]'' mosquitoes (which spread [[dengue fever]], [[yellow fever]], [[elephantiasis tropica|elephantiasis]], and other diseases) represent only 30 species; eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per annum, at a cost of reducing the [[genetic diversity]] of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Culicidae]] by only 1%. She further argues that since species become extinct "all the time" the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the [[ecosystem]]: "We're not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes. Removing one species sometimes causes shifts in the populations of other species—but different need not mean worse." In addition, anti-malarial and [[Mosquito#Control|mosquito control programs]] offer little realistic hope to the 300 million people in [[developing nation]]s who will be infected with acute illnesses this year. Although trials are ongoing, she writes that if they fail: "We should consider the ultimate swatting."&lt;ref name="Judson"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/25/opinion/a-bug-s-death.html |title=A Bug's Death |date=September 25, 2003 |author=Olivia Judson |publisher= The New York Times |accessdate=17 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] has advocated the eradication of several species of mosquito, including malaria vector ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]''. Wilson stated, "I'm talking about a very small number of species that have co-evolved with us and are preying on humans, so it would certainly be acceptable to remove them.

=== Cloning ===
{{Main|De-extinction}}
Some, such as Harvard geneticist [[George M. Church]], believe that ongoing technological advances will let us "bring back to life" an extinct species by [[Cloning#Cloning extinct and endangered species|cloning]], using [[DNA]] from the remains of that species. Proposed targets for cloning include the [[mammoth]], the [[thylacine]], and the [[Pyrenean ibex]]. For this to succeed, enough individuals would have to be cloned, from the DNA of different individuals (in the case of sexually reproducing organisms) to create a viable population. Though [[bioethics|bioethical]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] objections have been raised,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/24/news/mn-4250/2 |title= Cloned Goat Would Revive Extinct Line |author= A.

"This is something that could work, though it will be tedious and expensive," ''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, scientists tried to clone the extinct Pyrenean ibex (''C. p. pyrenaica''). This attempt failed: of the 285 embryos reconstructed, 54 were transferred to 12 mountain goats and [[mountain goat]]-[[Goat|domestic goat]] hybrids, but only two survived the initial two months of gestation before they too died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/cloned-goat-dies-after-attempt-to-bring-species-back-from-extinction-1522974.html |title= Cloned goat dies after attempt to bring species back from extinction |author= Steve Connor |date= 2009-02-02 |work= [[The Independent]]   |accessdate=2010-05-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a second attempt was made to clone the Pyrenean ibex: one clone was born alive, but died seven minutes later, due to physical defects in the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Extinct ibex is resurrected by cloning|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/4409958/Extinct-ibex-is-resurrected-by-cloning.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=31 Jan 2009|location=London|first1=Richard|last1=Gray|first2=Roger|last2=Dobson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Feria de Artesanías de Ponce''' (English: Ponce Crafts Fair), formally, '''Feria de Artesanías y Muestra de Arte de Ponce'''  (Ponce Crafts Fair and Arts Expo), is an event that takes place every year in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], [[Puerto Rico]], where artists, [[Artisan|craftsmen and artisans]] showcase their products. The products showcased are traditionally hand-made and in small quantities. The fair centers around crafts that highlight the traditional cultural background of Puerto Rico, including [[Taino]], [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], and Spanish traditions. The event started in 1974. The event is said to draw "thousands of visitors".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.periodicolaperla.com/punto-otra-cumbre-artesanal-ponce/ ''A Punto Para Otra Cumbre Artesanal en Ponce.''] La Perla del Sur.

==History==
Handcrafts and [[visual arts]] have a long cultural history in the city of Ponce. Some of its better known [[plastic arts|plastic artists]] are [[Miguel Pou]], [[Librado Net]], and [[Wichie Torres]]. Many [[Ponce Historic Zone]] homes were detailed by local craftsmen that worked alongside prominent Ponce architects in [[woodworking]], [[ironworking]], and [[metalworking]]. The [[Carnaval de Ponce]] is synonymous with [[paper-mache]] [[Vejigante]]s. The [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]] is an Island-wide mecca for visual arts and regarded as one of the best in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The [[Taino|Taino culture]] was strong in the Ponce region with Taino cacique [[Agüeybaná II|Agueybana]] originating from this region, and the [[Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center|Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Park]] being located in Ponce's Barrio [[Portugués Rural|Portugués]]. Taíno artifacts have also been found in Ponce's Caracoles sector. Ponce was also the Island's stronghold of [[African culture]] as African slaves were brought to the Ponce area in large quantities to work the sugar fields during the 19th century sugar cane rush; the only [[Abolition Park|monument to the abolition of slavery]] in Puerto Rico and the entire Caribbean is located in Ponce.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia de la artesanía puertorriqueña: introducción y guía de estudio.''

The '''Formula Lites''' series is a single-seater [[formula racing]] class launched for 2015. The series is sanctioned by [[SCCA Pro Racing]].

==History==
The  '''High Performance Group''' and Crawford Composites announced the creation of the Formula Lites Series in 2014. [[Dane Cameron]] debuted the car at Virginia International Raceway during the 2014 Ultimate Track Car Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ULTIMATE TRACK CAR CHALLENGE PRESENTED BY GRASSROOTS MOTORSPORTS|url=http://www.formulalites.com/ultimate-track-car-challenge-presented-by-grassroots-motorsports/|website=Formula Lites|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first race of the Formula Lites Series was run at the [[Thompson Speedway]] Road Course. Driver [[Nick Neri]] won the inaugural event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 FORMULA LITES SERIES RACE RESULTS|url=http://www.formulalites.com/2015-formula-lites-series-race-results/|website=Formula Lites|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series saw only six entries at every race during its initial season. The 2016 schedule was announced but no 2016 races have occurred, putting the series on indefinite hiatus.

==Car==
The drivers all use the same type of car. [[Crawford Composites]] designed and constructed the Crawford FL15. The Crawford FL15 has a [[carbon fiber]] monocoque chassis built according to [[Formula 3|FIA F3]] technical regulations. The car is powered by a 2.4 L  [[Volkswagen|Honda]] power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crawford Composites launches "Formula Lites" class for SCCA Pro Racing|url=http://www.racer.com/latest-stories/item/101716-crawford-composites-launches-formula-lites-spec-class|website=Racer|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2.4&amp;nbsp;L [[Honda K engine#K24|Honda K24]] engine will be built by [[Honda Performance Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Formula Lites Selects Honda Power|url=http://www.formulalites.com/formula-lites-selects-honda-power/|website=Formula Lites|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The racing class was announced with the unveiling of the car at the [[North American Motorsports Expo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCCA Adding Developmental Formula Series|url=http://www.nationalspeedsportnews.com/road-racing/scca/scca-adding-developmental-formula-series/|website=National Speedsport News|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Formula Maruti in Coimbatore Track.jpg|thumb|right|A Formula Maruti racing car]]
[[Image:Formula Maruti.jpg|thumb|right|First round races of the 2006 JK Tyre Junior Cup - Ajay Kini leads Ajit Narasimhan and Rana Kar out of C3]]

'''Formula Maruti''' is a single-seater, [[open wheel|open-wheel]] class in [[motorsport]] made and raced in [[India]]. Many of the top teams in Indian motorsports have run in the series, including Team Lakshmi Mills Superspeeds, Team JK, Team MRF, Gabriel Racing, WSRF Racing, McDowell Racing, and Team Valvoline. Top Indian drivers have started their career racing in Formula Maruti, most notably [[Narain Karthikeyan]], [[Parthiva Sureshwaren]], [[Karun Chandhok]] and other drivers who have had quite a successful outing in this form are Ajay Kini, Mohit Aryan, Goutham Parekh, Narendhran, Sudarshan Rao, Kartik Shankar.

==Design==
The car was a brainchild of [[S. Karivardhan]] who wanted an affordable single seater that can be highly economical to run/own, as well as being a stepping stone to several new drivers. It made its debut in 1988 at the [[Sholavaram]] races in [[Chennai]]. Young drivers in India often begin their competitive careers in Formula Maruti, or after a few years in Karting. Formula Maruti provides drivers with their first insights of a racecar, their first racecar experience, and this is where they cut their teeth in racecar set-up.

==Engine==
The engine and gearbox are from [[Maruti 800]] car, which is an 800&amp;nbsp;cc 3-cylinder engine. This series is a regular in the Indian motorsport scene ever since its launch in 1988. The chassis is a spaceframe monocoque with FRP body panels.

The '''Great Recession''' was a period of general economic decline observed in world markets during the late 2000s and early 2010s. The scale and timing of the recession varied from country to country.&lt;ref name=DPAD121912&gt;{{cite web |title = World Economic Situation and Prospects 2013 |url = https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wesp/index.shtml |publisher = Development Policy and Analysis Division of the UN secretariat |accessdate = December 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UN011513&gt;{{cite book |title = World Economic Situation and Prospects 2013 |publisher = United Nations |isbn = 978-9211091663 |page = 200 |author = United Nations |edition = 1st |type = trade paperback |date = January 15, 2013 |quote = The global economy continues to struggle with post-crisis adjustments }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Monetary Fund]] concluded that the overall impact was the most severe since the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="New IMF Global Recession definition"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF WEO 2009"/&gt; The Great Recession stemmed from collapse of the United States real-estate market, in relation to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis of 2007 to 2008]] and U.S. [[subprime mortgage crisis]] of 2007 to 2009, though policies of other nations contributed also. According to the U.S. [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (the official arbiter of U.S. recessions) the US recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, thus extending over 19 months.&lt;ref name="nber.org"&gt;[https://www.nber.org/cycles/ US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925210636/https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |date=September 25, 2008 }}, NBER, accessed August 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Recession resulted in the scarcity of valuable assets in the market economy and the collapse of the financial sector (banks) in the world economy. Some banks were bailed out by the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;http://economics.mit.edu/files/1801&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slideplayer.com/slide/6075380/|title=The Macroeconomics of Asset Shortages -  ppt video online download|website=slideplayer.com|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recession was not felt equally around the world. Whereas most of the world's developed economies, particularly in North America and Europe, fell into a definitive recession, many of the newer developed economies suffered far less impact, particularly [[China]] and [[India]], whose economies grew substantially during this period.

==Terminology==
Two [[word sense|senses]] of the word "recession" exist: one sense referring broadly to "a period of reduced economic activity"&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster_recession"&gt;{{Citation |author = Merriam-Webster |title = headword "recession" |work = Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary online |url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/recession |postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ongoing hardship; and the more precise sense used in [[economics]], which is [[operational definition|defined operationally]], referring specifically to the [[Inflection point|contraction phase]] of a [[business cycle]], with two or more consecutive quarters of [[GDP]] contraction. Under the academic definition, the recession ended in the United States in June or July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Gross]], [http://www.newsweek.com/id/206631?from=rss The Recession Is...

[[Robert Kuttner]] argues, “’The Great Recession,’ is a misnomer. We should stop using it. Recessions are mild dips in the business cycle that are either self-correcting or soon cured by modest fiscal or monetary stimulus. Because of the continuing deflationary trap, it would be more accurate to call this decade's stagnant economy The Lesser Depression or The Great Deflation."&lt;ref&gt;Kuttner, Robert. ''Debtors’ Prison: The Politics of Austerity Versus Possibility''. New York: Vintage Books, 2013, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{Great Recession sidebar}}
The Great Recession met the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] criteria for being a [[global recession]] only in the single calendar year 2009.&lt;ref name="New IMF Global Recession definition"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/04/22/whats-a-global-recession/|title=What's a Global Recession?|last=Davis|first=Bob|date=April 22, 2009|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF WEO 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/pdf/text.pdf |title = World Economic Outlook&amp;nbsp;— April 2009: Crisis and Recovery |format = PDF |work = Box 1.1 (page 11-14) |publisher = IMF |date = April 24, 2009 |accessdate = September 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That IMF definition requires a ''decline in annual real [[Gross world product|world GDP]] per{{nbhyph}}capita &lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;''. Despite the fact that quarterly data are being used as [[recession]] definition criteria by all [[G-20 major economies|G20 members]], representing 85% of the [[Gross world product|world GDP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://g20.org/about-g20/g20-members/|title = G20 Members|publisher = G20.org|accessdate = January 15, 2014|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150210155549/https://g20.org/about-g20/g20-members/|archivedate = February 10, 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has decided—in the absence of a complete data set—not to declare/measure global recessions according to quarterly GDP data. The ''seasonally adjusted [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]{{nbhyph}}weighted real GDP'' for the G20{{nbhyph}}zone, however, is a good indicator for the world GDP, and it was measured to have suffered a direct [[quarter on quarter]] decline during the three quarters from Q3{{nbhyph}}2008 until Q1{{nbhyph}}2009,&lt;!-- 2008Q3 = -0.02%, 2008Q4 = -1.66%, 2009Q1 = -1.67% --&gt; which more accurately mark when the recession took place at the global level.&lt;ref name="stats.oecd.org"/&gt;

According  to the U.S. [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (the official arbiter of U.S. recessions) the recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, and thus extended over eighteen months.&lt;ref name="nber.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/12/01/nber-makes-it-official-recession-started-in-december-2007/ |work = The Wall Street Journal |title = NBER Makes It Official: Recession Started in December 2007 |date = December 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The years leading up to the crisis were characterized by an exorbitant rise in asset prices and associated boom in economic demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/03/commodities |title = Oil prices: George Soros warns that speculators could trigger stock market crash |last = Wearden |first = Graeme |date = June 3, 2008 |publisher = The Guardian |accessdate = April 10, 2009 |location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the U.S. [[shadow banking system]] (i.e., non-depository financial institutions such as investment banks) had grown to rival the depository system yet was not subject to the same regulatory oversight, making it vulnerable to a [[bank run]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/business/economy/24panel.html|title=Greenspan Concedes Error on Regulation|last=Andrews|first=Edmund L.|date=October 24, 2008|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=April 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US mortgage-backed [[securities]], which had risks that were hard to assess, were marketed around the world, as they offered higher yields than U.S. government bonds. Many of these securities were backed by subprime mortgages, which collapsed in value when the U.S. housing bubble burst during 2006 and homeowners began to default on their mortgage payments in large numbers starting in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.forbes.com/2009/01/14/global-recession-2009-oped-cx_nr_0115roubini.html |title = A Global Breakdown Of The Recession In 2009 |author = [[Nouriel Roubini]] |date = January 15, 2009 |work = Forbes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of [[subprime lending|sub-prime loan]] losses in 2007 began the crisis and exposed other risky loans and over-inflated asset prices. With loan losses mounting and the fall of [[Lehman Brothers]] on September 15, 2008, a major panic broke out on the inter-bank loan market. There was the equivalent of a bank run on the [[shadow banking system]],  resulting in many large and well established [[investment bank|investment]] and [[commercial bank|commercial]] banks in the United States and [[Europe]] suffering huge losses and even facing bankruptcy, resulting in massive public financial assistance (government bailouts).&lt;ref name="KrugmanGeithner1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jul/10/geithner-does-he-pass-test/ |title = NYT-Paul Krugman-Geithner: Does He Pass The Test? |publisher = Nybooks.com |date = July 10, 2014 |accessdate = August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global recession that followed resulted in a sharp drop in [[international trade]], rising [[unemployment]] and slumping commodity prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/01/news/economy/recession/index.htm?postversion=2008120112|title=It's official: Recession since Dec '07|last=Isidore|first=Chris|date=December 1, 2008|publisher=CNN Money|accessdate=April 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several economists predicted that recovery might not appear until 2011 and that the recession would be the worst since the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/251/story/60822.html Congressional Budget Office compares downturn to Great Depression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303075017/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/251/story/60822.html |date=March 3, 2009 }}.

Governments and central banks responded with [[Fiscal policy|fiscal]] and [[monetary policy|monetary policies]] to stimulate national economies and reduce financial system risks. The recession has renewed interest in [[2008–09 Keynesian resurgence|Keynesian economic ideas]] on how to combat recessionary conditions.

===Panel reports===
The majority report provided by U.S. [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]], composed of six Democratic and four Republican appointees, reported its findings in January 2011. It concluded that "the crisis was avoidable and was caused by:
* Widespread failures in financial regulation, including the Federal Reserve's failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages;
* Dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk;
* An explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and Wall Street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis;
* Key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis, lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw; and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels."&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://fcic.law.stanford.edu/report/conclusions |title = Financial Crisis Inquiry Report-Conclusions-January 2011 |publisher = Fcic.law.stanford.edu |date = March 10, 2011 |accessdate = April 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two Republican dissenting FCIC reports. One of them, signed by three Republican appointees, concluded that there were multiple causes. In his separate dissent to the majority and minority opinions of the FCIC, Commissioner [[Peter J. Wallison]] of the [[American Enterprise Institute]] (AEI) primarily blamed U.S. housing policy, including the actions of [[Fannie Mae|Fannie]] &amp; [[Freddie Mac|Freddie]], for the crisis. He wrote: "When the bubble began to deflate in mid-2007, the low quality and high risk loans engendered by government policies failed in unprecedented numbers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-reports/fcic_final_report_wallison_dissent.pdf |title = FCIC-Final Report Dissent of Wallison-January 2011 |format = PDF |date =  |accessdate = August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its "Declaration of the Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy," dated November 15, 2008, leaders of the [[G20 major economies|Group of 20]] cited the following causes:
{{quote|During a period of strong global growth, growing capital flows, and prolonged stability earlier this decade, market participants sought higher yields without an adequate appreciation of the risks and failed to exercise proper due diligence. At the same time, weak underwriting standards, unsound risk management practices, increasingly complex and opaque financial products, and consequent excessive leverage combined to create vulnerabilities in the system. Policy-makers, regulators and supervisors, in some advanced countries, did not adequately appreciate and address the risks building up in financial markets, keep pace with financial innovation, or take into account the systemic ramifications of domestic regulatory actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/11/20081115-1.html |title = Declaration of G20 |publisher = Whitehouse.gov |date =  |accessdate = February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Narratives===
[[File:U.S. Fixed Investment as Pct GDP.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|U.S. residential and non-residential investment fell relative to GDP during the crisis]]
There are several "narratives" attempting to place the causes of the recession into context, with overlapping elements. Five such narratives include:
# There was the equivalent of a [[bank run]] on the [[shadow banking system]], which includes investment banks and other non-depository financial entities. This system had grown to rival the depository system in scale yet was not subject to the same regulatory safeguards. Its failure disrupted the flow of credit to consumers and corporations.&lt;ref name="KrugmanGeithner1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frbatlanta.org"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.frbatlanta.org/news/CONFEREN/09fmc/gorton.pdf |title = Gary Gorton-NBER and Yale-Slapped in the Face by the Invisible Hand: Banking and the Panic of 2007-Updated May 2009 |format = PDF |date =  |accessdate = August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The U.S. economy was being driven by a housing bubble. When it burst, private residential investment (i.e., housing construction) fell by nearly four percent. GDP and consumption enabled by bubble-generated housing wealth also slowed. This created a gap in annual demand (GDP) of nearly $1 trillion. The U.S. government was unwilling to make up for this private sector shortfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/robert-samuelson-wants-people-to-be-unemployed-the-economics-of-the-economics-of-the-great-recession |title = CEPR-Dean Baker-The Economics of the Great Recession-June 29, 2014 |publisher = Cepr.net |date = June 29, 2014 |accessdate = August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/learned-macroeconomic-helplessness/?module=BlogPost-Title&amp;version=Blog+Main&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;action=Click&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;region=Body|title=Learned Macroeconomic Helplessness|publisher=|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Record levels of [[household debt]] accumulated in the decades preceding the crisis resulted in a [[balance sheet recession]] (similar to [[debt deflation]]) once housing prices began falling in 2006. Consumers began paying off debt, which reduces their consumption, slowing down the economy for an extended period while debt levels are reduced.&lt;ref name="KrugmanGeithner1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mian and Sufi2014"&gt;{{cite book |last = Mian, Atif and |first = Sufi, Amir |year = 2014 |title = [[House of Debt]] |publisher = University of Chicago |isbn = 978-0-226-08194-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# U.S. government policies encouraged home ownership even for those who could not afford it, contributing to lax lending standards, unsustainable housing price increases, and indebtedness.&lt;ref name="Sowell 2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Housing Boom and Bust]]|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|publisher=Basic Books|year=2009|isbn=978-0-465-01880-2|pages=57–58|authorlink=Thomas Sowell}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Wealthy and middle-class [[flipping|house flippers]] with mid-to-good credit scores created a [[Economic bubble|speculative bubble]] in house prices, and then wrecked local housing markets and financial institutions after they defaulted on their debt en masse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1064061/house-flippers-triggered-the-us-housing-market-crash-not-poor-subprime-borrowers-a-new-study-shows/|title=House flippers triggered the US housing market crash, not poor subprime borrowers|first=Gwynn|last=Guilford|publisher=|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underlying narratives #1-3 is a hypothesis that growing [[Income inequality in the United States|income inequality]] and [[Household income in the United States|wage stagnation]] encouraged families to increase their [[household debt]] to maintain their desired living standard, fueling the bubble. Further, this greater share of income flowing to the top increased the political power of business interests, who used that power to [[Deregulation|deregulate]] or limit regulation of the shadow banking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/cas/economics/pdf/upload/2012-1.pdf|title=Jon Wisman-Wage Stagnation, Rising Inequality and the Crisis of 2008-Retrieved June 2015|publisher=|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2010/wp10268.pdf|title=IMF-Inequality, Leverage and Crises-Kumhoff and Ranciere-November 2010|publisher=|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/working_papers/working_papers_251-300/WP282.pdf|title=Stockhammer-Rising Inequality as a Cause of the Present Crisis-Amherst PERI-April 2012|publisher=|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative #5 challenges the popular claim that subprime borrowers with shoddy credit caused the crisis by buying homes they couldn't afford.  This narrative is supported by new research showing that the biggest growth of mortgage debt during the U.S. housing boom came from those with good credit scores in the middle and top of the credit score distribution—and that these borrowers accounted for a disproportionate share of defaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/newsroom/articles/rethinking-how-the-housing-crisis-happened/|title=Rethinking how the housing crisis happened|website=mitsloan.mit.edu|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade imbalances and debt bubbles===
[[File:US Private Debt to GDP by Sector.png|thumb|upright=1.6|right|U.S. households and financial businesses significantly increased borrowing (leverage) in the years leading up to the crisis]]
''[[The Economist]]'' wrote in July 2012 that the inflow of investment dollars required to fund the U.S. trade deficit was a major cause of the housing bubble and financial crisis: "The trade deficit, less than 1% of GDP in the early 1990s, hit 6% in 2006. That deficit was financed by inflows of foreign savings, in particular from East Asia and the Middle East. Much of that money went into dodgy mortgages to buy overvalued houses, and the financial crisis was the result."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.economist.com/node/21558591 |title = The Economist-Points of Light-July 14, 2012 |publisher = Economist.com |date = July 14, 2012 |accessdate = April 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, NPR explained in their [[Peabody Award]] winning program "[[The Giant Pool of Money]]" that a vast inflow of savings from developing nations flowed into the mortgage market, driving the U.S. housing bubble. This pool of fixed income savings increased from around $35 trillion in 2000 to about $70 trillion by 2008. NPR explained this money came from various sources, "[b]ut the main headline is that all sorts of poor countries became kind of rich, making things like TVs and selling us oil. China, India, Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia made a lot of money and banked it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/transcript |title = NPR-This American Life-The Giant Pool of Money-May 2008 |publisher = Thisamericanlife.org |date =  |accessdate = April 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing the crisis in Europe, [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in February 2012 that: "What we're basically looking at, then, is a balance of payments problem, in which capital flooded south after the creation of the euro, leading to overvaluation in southern Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/25/european-crisis-realities/ |title = NYT-Paul Krugman-European Crisis Realities-February 2012 |publisher = Krugman.blogs.nytimes.com |date = February 25, 2012 |accessdate = April 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monetary policy===
Another narrative about the origin has been focused on the respective parts played by the public monetary policy (in the US notably) and by the practices of private financial institutions.  In the U.S., mortgage funding was unusually decentralised, opaque, and competitive, and it is believed that competition between lenders for revenue and market share contributed to declining underwriting standards and risky lending.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;

While Alan Greenspan's role as [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]] has been widely discussed (the main point of controversy remains the lowering of the [[Federal funds rate]] to 1% for more than a year, which, according to [[Austrian School|Austrian theorists]], injected huge amounts of "easy" credit-based money into the financial system and created an unsustainable economic boom),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = Polleit |first = Thorsten |url = https://mises.org/story/2810 |title = Manipulating the Interest Rate: a Recipe for Disaster |publisher = Mises Institute |date = December 13, 2007 |accessdate = January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is also the argument that Greenspan's actions in the years 2002–2004 were actually motivated by the need to take the U.S. economy out of the [[early 2000s recession]] caused by the bursting of the [[dot-com bubble]]—although by doing so he did not help avert the crisis, but only postpone it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Ann |last = Pettifor |url = http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/america-s-financial-meltdown-lessons-and-prospects |title = America's financial meltdown: lessons and prospects |publisher = openDemocracy |date = September 16, 2008 |accessdate = January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mises.org/story/1670|title=America's Unsustainable Boom|last=Karlsson|first=Stefan|date=November 8, 2004|publisher=Mises Institute|accessdate=January 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another narrative focuses on high levels of private debt in the US economy.

The IMF reported in April 2012: "Household debt soared in the years leading up to the downturn. In advanced economies, during the five years preceding 2007, the ratio of household debt to income rose by an average of 39 percentage points, to 138 percent. In Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway, debt peaked at more than 200 percent of household income. A surge in household debt to historic highs also occurred in emerging economies such as Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, and Lithuania. The concurrent boom in both house prices and the stock market meant that household debt relative to assets held broadly stable, which masked households' growing exposure to a sharp fall in asset prices. When house prices declined, ushering in the global financial crisis, many households saw their wealth shrink relative to their debt, and, with less income and more unemployment, found it harder to meet mortgage payments. By the end of 2011, real house prices had fallen from their peak by about 41% in Ireland, 29% in Iceland, 23% in Spain and the United States, and 21% in Denmark. Household defaults, underwater mortgages (where the loan balance exceeds the house value), foreclosures, and fire sales are now endemic to a number of economies. Household [[deleveraging]] by paying off debts or defaulting on them has begun in some countries. It has been most pronounced in the United States, where about two-thirds of the debt reduction reflects defaults."&lt;ref name="imf.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/01/pdf/c3.pdf|title=IMF-Report Extract Chapter 3&amp;nbsp;– April 2012|date=|format=PDF|accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/financial_markets/debt_and_deleveraging_the_global_credit_bubble_update |title = McKinsey-Debt and deleveraging: The global credit bubble and its economic consequences-Updated-July 2011 |publisher = Mckinsey.com |date = March 13, 2013 |accessdate = August 17, 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130307011351/http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/financial_markets/debt_and_deleveraging_the_global_credit_bubble_update |archive-date = March 7, 2013 |dead-url = yes |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-recession warnings===
The onset of the economic crisis took most people by surprise. A 2009 paper identifies twelve economists and commentators who, between 2000 and 2006, predicted a recession based on the collapse of the then-booming housing market in the United States:&lt;ref name="Bezemer"&gt;Dirk J Bezemer: ''"No One Saw This Coming" Understanding Financial Crisis Through Accounting Models'', available via: [http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/15892/1/MPRA_paper_15892.pdf MPRA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906094437/http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/15892/1/MPRA_paper_15892.pdf |date=September 6, 2015 }}, esp. p. 9 and appendix.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dean Baker]], [[Wynne Godley]], [[Fred Harrison (author)|Fred Harrison]], [[Michael Hudson (economist)|Michael Hudson]], [[Eric Janszen]], [[Med Jones]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DvEDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=rational+investing+med+jones#v=onepage&amp;q=rational%20investing%20med%20jones |title=Columbia University Press, Rational Investing Book, Page 61-62 What Can Be Forecasted}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Keen]], [[Jakob Broechner Madsen|Jakob Brøchner Madsen]], Jens Kjaer Sørensen, [[Kurt Richebächer]], [[Nouriel Roubini]], [[Peter Schiff]], and [[Robert Shiller]].&lt;ref name="Bezemer"/&gt;

===Housing bubbles===
[[File:FCIC - Housing Bubbles in Multiple Countries 2002-2008.png|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Housing price appreciation in selected countries, 2002–2008]]
{{further|Real estate bubble}}
By 2007, real estate bubbles were still under way in many parts of the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://lvrg.org.au/blog/2009/06/from-subprime-to-terrigenous-recession.html |title = From the subprime to the terrigenous: Recession begins at home |publisher = Land Values Research Group |date = June 2, 2009 }} (A survey of recessions or expected recessions in 40 countries, 33 of which arguably had property bubbles.)&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the [[United States housing bubble|United States]],&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1924831 ''Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[France]], [[British property bubble|United Kingdom]], [[Spanish property bubble|Spain]], [[The Netherlands]], [[Australia]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[New Zealand property bubble|New Zealand]], [[Irish property bubble|Ireland]], [[Polish property bubble|Poland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Europe/Poland/Price-History |title = The end of Poland's house price boom |publisher = Global Property Guide |date = August 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Africa]], [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Europe/Croatia/Price-History |title = Real estate prices in Adriatic Coast up, Zagreb down |publisher = Global Property Guide |date = August 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norway]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Argentina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Latin-America/Argentina/Price-History |title = The good times are here again |publisher = Global Property Guide |date = February 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baltic states]], [[India]], [[Romania]], [[Ukraine]], and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Asia/China/Price-History |title = Looming housing slump in China |publisher = Global Property Guide |date = September 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] said in mid-2005 that "at a minimum, there's a little 'froth' [in the U.S. housing market]...it's hard not to see that there are a lot of local bubbles".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/weekinreview/25track.ready.html |title = 2005: In a Word |author = Monica Davey |publisher = New York Times |date = December 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'', writing at the same time, went further, saying, "[T]he worldwide rise in house prices is the biggest bubble in history".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4079027 |title = The global housing boom |date = June 16, 2005 |publisher = The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt; Real estate bubbles are (by definition of the word "bubble") followed by a price decrease (also known as a ''housing price crash'') that can result in many owners holding [[negative equity]] (a [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] debt higher than the current value of the property).

===Ineffective or inappropriate regulation===

====Regulations encouraging lax lending standards====
Several analysts, such as Peter Wallison and Edward Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute, have asserted that private lenders were encouraged to relax lending standards by government affordable housing policies.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Wallison, "Cause and Effect: Government Policies and the Financial Crisis", Washington, DC: American Enterprise Institute, November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Statement of Edward Pinto, December 9, 2008, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; They cite The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, which initially required that 30 percent or more of Fannie's and Freddie's loan purchases be related to affordable housing. The legislation gave HUD the power to set future requirements. These rose to 42 percent in 1995 and 50 percent in 2000, and by 2008 (under the G.W. Bush Administration) a 56 percent minimum was established.&lt;ref name="Wallison 1"&gt;{{cite web |author = Peter J. Wallison |title = Dissent from the Majority Report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission |publisher = American Enterprise Institute |date = January 2011 |url = http://www.aei.org |accessdate = November 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To fulfill the requirements, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac established programs to purchase $5 trillion in affordable housing loans,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch? (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2012), 121.&lt;/ref&gt; and encouraged lenders to relax underwriting standards to produce those loans.&lt;ref name="Wallison 1"/&gt;

These critics also cite, as inappropriate regulation, "The National Homeownership Strategy: Partners in the American Dream ("Strategy"), which was compiled in 1995 by Henry Cisneros, President Clinton's HUD Secretary. In 2001, the independent research company, Graham Fisher &amp; Company, stated: "While the underlying initiatives of the [Strategy] were broad in content, the main theme ... was the relaxation of credit standards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Housing in the New Millennium: A Home without Equity Is Just a Rental with Debt |publisher = Ssrn.com |author = Graham Fisher |date = June 29, 2001 |ssrn = 1162456 |accessdate = November 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is also identified as one of the causes of the recession, by some critics. They contend that lenders relaxed lending standards in an effort to meet CRA commitments, and they note that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive, totaling $4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch? (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2012), 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) Democratic majority report concluded that Fannie &amp; Freddie "were not a primary cause" of the crisis and that CRA was not a factor in the crisis.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt; Further, since housing bubbles appeared in multiple countries in Europe as well, the FCIC Republican minority dissenting report also concluded that U.S. housing policies were not a robust explanation for a wider global housing bubble.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt; The hypothesis that a primary cause of the crisis was U.S. government housing policy requiring banks to make risky loans has been widely disputed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Examining the Big Lie |publisher = The Big Picture |author = Barry Ritholtz |date = November 26, 2011 |url = http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/11/examining-the-big-lie-how-the-facts-of-the-economic-crisis-stack-up/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Paul Krugman]] referring to it as "imaginary history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Triumph of the Wrong |publisher = The New York Times |author = Paul Krugman |date = November 6, 2014 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/opinion/paul-krugman-triumph-of-the-wrong.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the other challenges with blaming government regulations for essentially forcing banks to make risky loans is the timing. Subprime lending increased from around 10% of mortgage origination historically to about 20% only from 2004-2006, with housing prices peaking in 2006. Blaming affordable housing regulations established in the 1990s for a sudden spike in subprime origination is problematic at best.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt; A more proximate government action to the sudden rise in subprime lending was the SEC relaxing lending standards for the top investment banks during an April 2004 meeting with bank leaders. These banks increased their risk-taking shortly thereafter, significantly increasing their purchases and securitization of lower-quality mortgages, thus encouraging additional subprime and Alt-A lending by mortgage companies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html NYT-Labaton-Agency's '04 Rule Let Banks Pile Up New Debt-October 2, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; This action by its investment bank competitors also resulted in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac taking on more risk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/business/05fannie.html NYT-Duhigg-Pressured to Take More Risk, Fannie Reached Tipping Point-October 4, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Derivatives====
Several sources have noted the failure of the US government to supervise or even require transparency of the [[financial instruments]] known as [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/warning/ The Warning]| Frontline&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=devils/&gt;&lt;ref name=faiola/&gt; Derivatives such as [[credit default swap]]s (CDSs) were unregulated or barely regulated. [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]] noted CDSs enabled speculators to stack bets on the same mortgage securities. This is analogous to allowing many persons to buy insurance on the same house. Speculators that bought CDS protection were betting significant mortgage security defaults would occur, while the sellers (such as [[AIG]]) bet they would not. An unlimited amount could be wagered on the same housing-related securities, provided buyers and sellers of the CDS could be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Michael LewisPhotograph by Jonas Fredwall Karlsson |url = http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/04/wall-street-excerpt-201004 |title = Vanity Fair-Michael Lewis-Betting the Blind Side-April 2010 |publisher = Vanityfair.com |date =  |accessdate = August 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When massive defaults occurred on underlying mortgage securities, companies like AIG that were selling CDS were unable to perform their side of the obligation and defaulted; U.S. taxpayers paid over $100 billion to global financial institutions to honor AIG obligations, generating considerable outrage.&lt;ref name="Scott Lanman"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=az3C8NMLBKbY|title=Bloomberg&amp;nbsp;– Senators Dodd &amp; Shelby Demand Information|last=Lanman|first=Scott|date=March 5, 2009|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 investigative article in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' found leading government officials at the time (Federal Reserve Board Chairman  [[Alan Greenspan]], Treasury Secretary [[Robert Rubin]], and [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] Chairman [[Arthur Levitt]])  vehemently opposed any regulation of derivatives. In 1998, [[Brooksley E. Born]], head of the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]], put forth a policy paper asking for feedback from regulators, lobbyists, and legislators on the question of whether derivatives should be reported, sold through a central facility, or whether capital requirements should be required of their buyers. Greenspan, Rubin, and Levitt pressured her to withdraw the paper and Greenspan persuaded [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass a resolution preventing CFTC from regulating derivatives for another six months&amp;nbsp;— when Born's term of office would expire.&lt;ref name=devils&gt;[[Bethany McLean]] and [[Joe Nocera]], ''[[All the Devils Are Here: The Hidden History of the Financial Crisis]]'' Portfolio, Penguin, 2010, p.104-7&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, it was the collapse of a specific kind of derivative, the [[mortgage-backed security]], that triggered the economic crisis of 2008.&lt;ref name="faiola"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/14/AR2008101403343.html|title=What Went Wrong|date=October 15, 2008|publisher=The Washington Post|authors=Anthony Faiola, Ellen Nakashima and Jill Drew|accessdate=April 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shadow banking system====
[[File:Securitization Market Activity.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Securitization markets were impaired during the crisis.]]

[[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2009 that the [[bank run|run]] on the [[shadow banking system]] was the fundamental cause the crisis. "As the shadow banking system expanded to rival or even surpass conventional banking in importance, politicians and government officials should have realised that they were re-creating the kind of financial vulnerability that made the Great Depression possible&amp;nbsp;– and they should have responded by extending regulations and the financial safety net to cover these new institutions. Influential figures should have proclaimed a simple rule: anything that does what a bank does, anything that has to be rescued in crises the way banks are, should be regulated like a bank." He referred to this lack of controls as "malign neglect".&lt;ref name="Krugman 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last = Krugman |first = Paul |authorlink = Paul Krugman |year = 2009 |title = [[The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008]] |publisher = W.W.

During 2008, three of the largest U.S. investment banks either went bankrupt ([[Lehman Brothers]]) or were sold at [[fire sale]] prices to other banks ([[Bear Stearns]] and [[Merrill Lynch]]). The investment banks were not subject to the more stringent regulations applied to depository banks. These failures exacerbated the instability in the global financial system.

AIG was contractually required to post additional collateral with many creditors and counter-parties, touching off controversy when over $100&amp;nbsp;billion of U.S. taxpayer money was paid out to major global financial institutions on behalf of AIG. While this money was legally owed to the banks by AIG (under agreements made via credit default swaps purchased from AIG by the institutions), a number of Congressmen and media members expressed outrage that taxpayer money was used to bail out banks.&lt;ref name="Scott Lanman" /&gt;

Economist [[Gary Gorton]] wrote in May 2009: {{quote|Unlike the historical banking panics of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the current banking panic is a wholesale panic, not a retail panic. In the earlier episodes, depositors ran to their banks and demanded cash in exchange for their checking accounts. Unable to meet those demands, the banking system became insolvent. The current panic involved financial firms "running" on other financial firms by not renewing sale and repurchase agreements (repo) or increasing the repo margin ("haircut"), forcing massive deleveraging, and resulting in the banking system being insolvent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.frbatlanta.org/news/CONFEREN/09fmc/gorton.pdf |title = Gary Gorton-NBER and Yale-Slapped in the Face by the Invisible Hand: Banking and the Panic of 2007-Updated May 2009 |format = PDF |date =  |accessdate = April 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] reported in January 2011: {{quote|In the early part of the 20th century, we erected a series of protections&amp;nbsp;– the Federal Reserve as a [[lender of last resort]], federal deposit insurance, ample regulations&amp;nbsp;– to provide a bulwark against the panics that had regularly plagued America's banking system in the 19th century. Yet, over the past 30-plus years, we permitted the growth of a shadow banking system&amp;nbsp;– opaque and laden with short term debt&amp;nbsp;– that rivaled the size of the traditional banking system. Key components of the market&amp;nbsp;– for example, the multitrillion-dollar repo lending market, off-balance-sheet entities, and the use of over-the-counter derivatives&amp;nbsp;– were hidden from view, without the protections we had constructed to prevent financial meltdowns.

===Systemic crisis===
The financial crisis and the recession have been described as a symptom of another, deeper crisis by a number of economists. For example, [[Ravi Batra]] argues that growing inequality of [[financial capitalism]] produces speculative bubbles that burst and result in depression and major [[The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism|political changes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Batra |first = Ravi |url = http://www.truthout.org/weapons-mass-exploitation/1304696645 |title = Weapons of Mass Exploitation? |publisher = Truthout.org |date = May 8, 2011 |accessdate = June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Batra |first = Ravi |url = http://www.askbutwhy.com/2011/04/ravi-batra-on-thom-hartmann-show-04-29.html |title = Ravi Batra interview |publisher = Thom Hartman's radio show (at 1:15) |date = April 29, 2011 |accessdate = June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist economists [[Ailsa McKay]] and [[Margunn Bjørnholt]] argue that the financial crisis and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession. They argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within [[feminist economics]] and [[ecological economics]] that take as their starting point the socially responsible, sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other as well as the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.margunnbjornholt.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Advances-in-Feminist-Economics-in-Times-of-Economic-Crisis.pdf|title=Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics|last2=McKay|first2=Ailsa|publisher=[[Demeter Press]]|year=2014|isbn=9781927335277|pages=7–20|chapter=Advances in Feminist Economics in Times of Economic Crisis|format=PDF|last1=Bjørnholt|first1=Margunn|author1-link=Margunn Bjørnholt|author2-link=Ailsa McKay|editor1-last=Bjørnholt|editor1-first=Margunn|editor1-link=Margunn Bjørnholt|editor2-last=McKay|editor2-first=Ailsa|editor2-link=Ailsa McKay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Great Recession in the United States|Unemployment in the United States|National debt of the United States}}
The Great Recession had a significant economic and political impact on the United States.  While the recession technically lasted from December 2007-June 2009 (the nominal GDP trough), many important economic variables did not regain pre-recession (November or Q4 2007) levels until 2011-2016. For example, real GDP fell $650 billion (4.3%) and did not recover its $15 trillion pre-recession level until Q3 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1  FRED-Real GDP-Retrieved July 7, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;  Household net worth, which reflects the value of both stock markets and housing prices, fell $11.5 trillion (17.3%) and did not regain its pre-recession level of $66.4 trillion until Q3 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TNWBSHNO FRED-Household and Non-profit net worth]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of persons with jobs (total non-farm payrolls) fell 8.6 million (6.2%) and did not regain the pre-recession level of 138.3 million until May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[ https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS FRED-All Employees Total Nonfarm Payrolls-Retrieved July 7, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;  The unemployment rate peaked at 10.0% in October 2009 and did not return to its pre-recession level of 4.7% until May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE FRED-Unemployment Rate-Retrieved July 7, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

A key dynamic slowing the recovery was that both individuals and businesses paid down debts for several years, as opposed to borrowing and spending or investing as had historically been the case. This shift to a [[Sectoral balances|private sector surplus]] drove a sizable government deficit.&lt;ref name="NPI"&gt;[https://www.npi.org.uk/blog/economic-policy/united-states-sector-balances-over-five-decades/ New Policy Institute-United States Sectoral Balances over Five Decades-July 29, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the federal government held spending at about $3.5 trillion from fiscal years 2009-2014 (thereby decreasing it as a percent of GDP), a form of austerity. Then-Fed Chair [[Ben Bernanke]] explained during November 2012 several of the economic headwinds that slowed the recovery:
*The housing sector did not rebound, as was the case in prior recession recoveries, as the sector was severely damaged during the crisis. Millions of foreclosures had created a large surplus of properties and consumers were paying down their debts rather than purchasing homes.
*Credit for borrowing and spending by individuals (or investing by corporations) was not readily available as banks paid down their debts.
*Restrained government spending following initial stimulus efforts (i.e., austerity) was not sufficient to offset private sector weaknesses.&lt;ref name="Bernanke_Recovery"&gt;[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20121120a.htm Federal Reserve-Ben Bernanke-The Economic Recovery and Economic Policy-November 20, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the political front, widespread anger at [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|banking bailouts]] and [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|stimulus]] measures (begun by President [[George W. Bush]] and continued or expanded by President Obama) with few consequences for banking leadership, were a factor in driving the country politically rightward starting in 2010. Examples include the rise of the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] and the loss of Democratic majorities in subsequent elections. President Obama declared the bailout measures started under the Bush administration and continued during his administration as completed and mostly profitable {{as of|2014|December|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/20/business/us-signals-end-of-bailouts-of-automakers-and-wall-street.html New York Times-U.S. Declares Bank and Auto Bailouts Over, and Profitable-December 19, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2018|January|}}, bailout funds had been fully recovered by the government, when interest on loans is taken into consideration.

===Effects on Europe===
{{Further|European debt crisis|Austerity}}
[[File:Eurozone Countries Public Debt to GDP Ratio 2010 vs. 2011.png|right|thumb|Public Debt to GDP Ratio for Selected European Countries - 2008 to 2011. Source Data: Eurostat]]
[[File:Eurozone-structural1.jpg|thumb|Relationship between fiscal tightening (austerity) in [[Eurozone countries]] with their GDP growth rate, 2008–2012&lt;ref name=martin/&gt;]]
The crisis in Europe generally progressed from banking system crises to sovereign debt crises, as many countries elected to bail out their banking systems using taxpayer money. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Greece was different in that it faced large public debts rather than problems within its banking system. Several countries received bailout packages from the [[European troika|troika]] (European Commission, European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund), which also implemented a series of emergency measures.

Many European countries embarked on austerity programs, reducing their budget deficits relative to GDP from 2010 to 2011. For example, according to the ''[[CIA World Factbook]]'' Greece improved its budget deficit from 10.4% GDP in 2010 to 9.6% in 2011. Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, France, and Spain also improved their budget deficits from 2010 to 2011 relative to GDP.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gr.html |title = CIA World Factbook-Greece Example |publisher = Cia.gov |date =  |accessdate = August 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurostat1"&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/euroindicators/peeis Eurostat-Selected Principal European Economic Indicators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119182304/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/euroindicators/peeis/ |date=January 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with the exception of Germany, each of these countries had public-debt-to-GDP ratios that increased (i.e., worsened) from 2010 to 2011, as indicated in the chart at right. Greece's public-debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 143% in 2010 to 165% in 2011&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt;  to 185% in 2014. This indicates that despite improving budget deficits, GDP growth was not sufficient to support a decline (improvement) in the debt-to-GDP ratio for these countries during this period. [[Eurostat]] reported that the debt to GDP ratio for the 17 Euro area countries together was 70.1% in 2008, 79.9% in 2009, 85.3% in 2010, and 87.2% in 2011.&lt;ref name="Eurostat1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-23042012-AP/EN/2-23042012-AP-EN.PDF |title=Eurostat News Release-Euro indicators-23 April 2012 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919121523/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-23042012-AP/EN/2-23042012-AP-EN.PDF |archivedate=September 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''CIA World Factbook'', from 2010 to 2011, the unemployment rates in Spain, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and the UK increased. France had no significant changes, while in Germany and Iceland the unemployment rate declined.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; Eurostat reported that Eurozone unemployment reached record levels in September 2012 at 11.6%, up from 10.3% the prior year. Unemployment varied significantly by country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Smith |first = Aaron |url = http://money.cnn.com/2012/10/31/news/economy/euro-unemployment/index.html |title = Eurozone unemployment hits record high |publisher = Money.cnn.com |date = October 31, 2012 |accessdate = August 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Martin Wolf]] analysed the relationship between cumulative GDP growth from 2008-2012 and total reduction in budget deficits due to austerity policies (see chart at right) in several European countries during April 2012. He concluded that: "In all, there is no evidence here that large fiscal contractions [budget deficit reductions] bring benefits to confidence and growth that offset the direct effects of the contractions. They bring exactly what one would expect: small contractions bring recessions and big contractions bring depressions." Changes in budget balances (deficits or surpluses) [[Coefficient of determination|explained]] approximately 53% of the change in GDP, according to the equation derived from the IMF data used in his analysis.&lt;ref name=martin&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.ft.com/martin-wolf-exchange/2012/04/27/the-impact-of-fiscal-austerity-in-the-eurozone/ |first = Martin |last = Wolf |title = The Impact of Fiscal Austerity in the Eurozone |publisher = Blogs.ft.com |date = April 27, 2012 |accessdate = August 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] analysed the relationship between GDP and reduction in budget deficits for several European countries in April 2012 and concluded that austerity was slowing growth, similar to Martin Wolf. He also wrote: "...&amp;nbsp;this also implies that 1 euro of austerity yields only about 0.4 euros of reduced deficit, even in the short run. No wonder, then, that the whole austerity enterprise is spiraling into disaster."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/austerity-and-growth-again-wonkish/|title=Austerity And Growth, Again (Wonkish)|publisher=|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Countries that avoided recession===
[[Poland]] and [[Slovakia]] are the only two members of the [[European Union]] to have avoided a GDP recession during the years affected by the Great Recession.

While [[India]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[China]], and [[Iran]] experienced slowing growth, they did not enter recessions.

[[South Korea]] narrowly avoided technical recession in the first quarter of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8015918.stm |title = S Korea avoids entering recession |publisher = BBC |date = April 24, 2009 |accessdate = January 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International Energy Agency]] stated in mid September that South Korea could be the only large [[OECD]] country to avoid recession for the whole of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090910-703229.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201213428/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090910-703229.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 1, 2009|title=IEA:S Korea May Be Only Large OECD Country To Avoid Recession - WSJ.com|date=December 1, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only developed economy to expand in the first half of 2009.

The financial crisis did not affect developing countries to a great extent. Experts see several reasons: Africa was not affected because it is not fully integrated in the world market. Latin America and Asia seemed better prepared, since they have experienced crises before. In Latin America, for example, banking laws and regulations are very stringent. Bruno Wenn of the German DEG suggests that Western countries could learn from these countries when it comes to regulations of financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Exceedingly high interest rates |author = Bruno Wenn |publisher = dandc.eu |date = January 2013 |url = http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/european-bank-regulators-would-do-well-learn-their-latin-american-counterparts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iceland fell into an economic depression in 2008 following the collapse of its banking system (''see [[2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis]]'').

==Political instability related to the economic crisis==
On February 26, 2009, an Economic Intelligence Briefing was added to the [[President's Daily Brief|daily intelligence briefings]] prepared for the [[President of the United States]]. This addition reflects the assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies that the global financial crisis presents a serious threat to international stability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/25/AR2009022503389.html "CIA Adds Economy To Threat Updates] White House Given First Daily Briefing" article by Joby Warrick, Washington Post Staff Writer, Thursday, February 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientists have argued that the economic stasis triggered social churning that got expressed through protests on a variety of issues across the developing world. In Brazil, disaffected youth rallied against a minor bus-fare hike;&lt;ref name="nytReport"&gt;Romero, Simon. [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/world/americas/bus-fare-protests-hit-brazils-two-biggest-cities.html "Bus-fare protests hit Brazil's two biggest cities"],  [[The New York Times]], June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; in Turkey, they agitated against the conversion of a park to a mall&lt;ref name="guardianReport"&gt;Letsch, Constanze. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/31/istanbul-protesters-violent-clashes-police "Turkey protests spread after violence in Istanbul over park demolition"],  [[The Guardian]], May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Israel, they protested against high rents in Tel Aviv. In all these cases, the ostensible immediate cause of the protest was amplified by the underlying social suffering induced by the great recession.

In January 2009, the government leaders of Iceland were forced to call elections two years early after the people of Iceland staged mass protests and clashed with the police because of the government's handling of the economy.&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt; Hundreds of thousands protested in France against President Sarkozy's economic policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/01/29/europe/france.4-418938.php|title=The New York Times&amp;nbsp;– Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|last=Dobbs|first=David|date=|publisher=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=April 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228220508/http://iht.com/articles/2009/01/29/europe/france.4-418938.php|archivedate=February 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prompted by the financial crisis in Latvia, the opposition and trade unions there organised a rally against the cabinet of premier Ivars Godmanis. The rally gathered some 10–20 thousand people. In the evening the rally turned into a [[2009 Riga riot|Riot]]. The crowd moved to the building of the parliament and attempted to force their way into it, but were repelled by the state's police. In late February many Greeks took part in a massive general strike because of the economic situation and they shut down schools, airports, and many other services in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Maltezou |first = Renee |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSLP45582720090225 |title = Greeks shut airports, services to protest economy |publisher = Reuters |date = February 25, 2009 |accessdate = May 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police and protesters  clashed in Lithuania where people protesting the economic conditions were shot with rubber bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = Megan K.

In addition to various levels of unrest in Europe, Asian countries have also seen various degrees of protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = Ian Traynor, Europe editor |url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/31/global-recession-europe-protests |title = Governments across Europe tremble as effects of global recession prompt angry people to take to the streets |work = The Guardian |date = January 31, 2009 |accessdate = May 15, 2012 |location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests have also occurred in China as demands from the west for exports have been dramatically reduced and unemployment has increased. Beyond these initial protests, the protest movement has grown and continued in 2011. In late 2011, the [[Occupy Wall Street]] protest took place in the United States, spawning several offshoots that came to be known as the [[Occupy movement]].

In 2012 the economic difficulties in Spain increased support for secession movements. In Catalonia, support for the [[Catalan separatism|secession movement]] exceeded.

The [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|financial phase of the crisis]] led to emergency interventions in many national financial systems. As the crisis developed into genuine recession in many major economies, economic stimulus meant to revive economic growth became the most common policy tool. After having implemented rescue plans for the banking system, major developed and emerging countries announced plans to relieve their economies. In particular, economic stimulus plans were announced in [[Chinese economic stimulus program|China]], the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|United States]], and the [[2008 European Union stimulus plan|European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2008/gb20081126_365422.htm|title=EU Proposes €200 Billion Stimulus Plan|date=November 26, 2008|work=Businessweek|accessdate=January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final quarter of 2008, the financial crisis saw the [[G-20 major economies|G-20 group of major economies]] assume a new significance as a focus of economic and financial crisis management.

On September 15, 2008, China cut its interest rate for the first time since 2002. Indonesia reduced its overnight rate, at which commercial banks can borrow overnight funds from the central bank, by two percentage points to 10.25 percent. The [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] injected nearly $1.5 billion into the banking system, nearly three times as much as the market's estimated requirement. The [[Reserve Bank of India]] added almost $1.32 billion, through a refinance operation, its biggest in at least a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/16/business/cbanks.php |title=Asian central banks spend billions to prevent crash |work=International Herald Tribune |date=September 16, 2008 |accessdate=September 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919042036/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/16/business/cbanks.php |archivedate=September 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2008, the [[Chinese economic stimulus program]], a RMB¥ 4 trillion ($586 billion) stimulus package, was announced by the central government of the People's Republic of China in its biggest move to stop the global financial crisis from hitting the world's second largest economy. A statement on the government's website said the State Council had approved a plan to invest 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) in infrastructure and social welfare by the end of 2010. The stimulus package was invested in key areas such as housing, rural infrastructure, transportation, health and education, environment, industry, disaster rebuilding, income-building, tax cuts, and finance.

China's export driven economy is starting to feel the impact of the economic slowdown in the United States and Europe, and the government has already cut key interest rates three times in less than two months in a bid to spur economic expansion. On November 28, 2008, the [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China]] and the [[State Administration of Taxation]] jointly announced a rise in export tax rebate rates on some labour-intensive goods. These additional tax rebates will take place on December 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

The stimulus package was welcomed by world leaders and analysts as larger than expected and a sign that by boosting its own economy, China is helping to stabilise the global economy. News of the announcement of the stimulus package sent markets up across the world. However, [[Marc Faber]] claimed that he thought China was still in recession on January 16.

In Taiwan, the central bank on September 16, 2008, said it would cut its required reserve ratios for the first time in eight years. The central bank added $3.59 billion into the foreign-currency interbank market the same day. Bank of Japan pumped $29.3 billion into the financial system on September 17, 2008, and the Reserve Bank of Australia added $3.45 billion the same day.&lt;ref name="World_Banks"&gt;{{Cite news |title = Germany Rescues Hypo Real Estate |url = http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3692522,00.html |publisher = [[Deutsche Welle]] |date = October 6, 2008 |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing and emerging economies, responses to the global crisis mainly consisted in low-rates monetary policy (Asia and the Middle East mainly) coupled with the depreciation of the currency against the dollar. There were also stimulus plans in some Asian countries, in the Middle East and in Argentina. In Asia, plans generally amounted to 1 to 3% of GDP, with the notable exception of [[Chinese economic stimulus plan|China]], which announced a plan accounting for 16% of GDP (6% of GDP per year).

===European policy responses===
Until September 2008, European policy measures were limited to a small number of countries (Spain and Italy). In both countries, the measures were dedicated to households (tax rebates) reform of the taxation system to support specific sectors such as housing. The European Commission proposed a [[2008 European Union stimulus plan|€200 billion stimulus plan]] to be implemented at the European level by the countries. At the beginning of 2009, the UK and Spain completed their initial plans, while Germany announced a new plan.

On September 29, 2008, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch authorities partially nationalised [[Fortis (finance)|Fortis]]. The German government bailed out [[Hypo Real Estate]].

On October 8, 2008, the British Government announced a [[2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package|bank rescue package]] of around £500 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/gordon-brown/4961897/Gordon-Brown-should-say-sorry-over-economy-minister-says.html |title=Gordon Brown should say 'sorry' |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=March 9, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2009 |location=London }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; ($850 billion at the time). The plan comprises three parts. The first £200 billion would be made in regard to the banks in liquidity stack. The second part will consist of the state government increasing the capital market within the banks. Along with this, £50&amp;nbsp;billion will be made available if the banks needed it, finally the government will write off any eligible lending between the British banks with a limit to £250 billion.

In early December 2008, German Finance Minister [[Peer Steinbrück]] indicated a lack of belief in a "Great Rescue Plan" and reluctance to spend more money addressing the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.newsweek.com/id/172613 |title = It Doesn't Exist! |publisher = Newsweek.com |date = December 6, 2008 |accessdate = December 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, The European Union Presidency confirmed that the EU was at the time strongly resisting the US pressure to increase European budget deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = Waterfield |first = Bruno |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/5048291/EU-presidency-US-and-UK-economic-recovery-plans-are-a-way-to-hell.html |title = EU resists deficits |publisher = Telegraph.co.uk |date = March 25, 2009 |accessdate = January 21, 2010 |location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010, the United Kingdom began a fiscal consolidation program to reduce debt and deficit levels while at the same time stimulating economic recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cutting the deficit: three years down, five to go?|url=http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/6683|publisher=The Institute for Fiscal Studies|accessdate=February 2, 2016|date=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other European countries also began fiscal consolidation with similar aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU fiscal consolidation after the financial crisis: Lessons from past experiences|url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/eu-fiscal-consolidation-after-global-crisis-lessons-past-experiences|publisher=VOX  CEPR's Policy Portal|accessdate=February 2, 2016|date=October 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global responses===

Most political responses to the economic and financial crisis has been taken, as seen above, by individual nations. Some coordination took place at the European level, but the need to cooperate at the global level has led leaders to activate the [[G-20 major economies]] entity. A first summit dedicated to the crisis took place, at the Heads of state level in November 2008 ([[2008 G-20 Washington summit]]).

The [[G-20 major economies|G-20 countries]] met in a summit held on [[2008 G-20 Washington summit|November 2008 in Washington]] to address the economic crisis. Apart from proposals on international financial regulation, they pledged to take measures to support their economy and to coordinate them, and refused any resort to protectionism.

[[2009 G-20 London Summit|Another G-20 summit]] was held in London on April 2009. Finance ministers and central banks leaders of the G-20 met in [[Horsham]], England, on March to prepare the summit, and pledged to restore global growth as soon as possible. They decided to coordinate their actions and to stimulate demand and employment. They also pledged to fight against all forms of [[protectionism]] and to maintain trade and foreign investments. These actions will cost $1.1tn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7979483.stm | work=BBC News | title=G20 leaders seal tn global deal | date=April 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also committed to maintain the supply of credit by providing more liquidity and recapitalising the banking system, and to implement rapidly the stimulus plans. As for central bankers, they pledged to maintain low-rates policies as long as necessary. Finally, the leaders decided to help emerging and developing countries, through a strengthening of the IMF.

==Policy recommendations==

===IMF recommendation===
The IMF stated in September 2010 that the financial crisis would not end without a major decrease in unemployment as hundreds of millions of people were unemployed worldwide. The IMF urged governments to expand social safety nets and to generate job creation even as they are under pressure to cut spending. The IMF also encouraged governments to invest in skills training for the unemployed and even governments of countries, similar to that of Greece, with major debt risk to first focus on long-term economic recovery by creating jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/business/global/14euro.html|title=I.M.F. Calls for Countries to Focus on Jobs|last=Alderman|first=Liz|date=September 13, 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raising interest rates===
The [[Bank of Israel]] was the first to raise interest rates after the global recession began.&lt;ref name="marketwatch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/israels-surprise-rate-cut-may-mean-other-em-cuts-2011-09-26|title=Israel rate cut suggests more emerging market cuts&amp;nbsp;– Emerging Markets Report|date=|publisher=MarketWatch|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It increased rates in August 2009.&lt;ref name="marketwatch.com"/&gt;

On October 6, 2009, [[Australia]] became the first G20 country to raise its main interest rate, with the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] moving rates up from 3.00% to 3.25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8291968.stm |title = Australia raises interest rates |publisher = BBC News |date = October 6, 2009 |accessdate = January 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Norges Bank]] of [[Norway]] and the [[Reserve Bank of India]] raised interest rates in March 2010.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/business/global/20rupee.html |work = The New York Times |title = India's Central Bank Raises Interest Rates |date = March 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, 2017 the [[Bank of England]] raised interest rates for the first time since March 2009 from 0.25% to 0.5% in an attempt to curb inflation.

==Comparisons with the Great Depression==
{{main|Comparisons between the Great Recession and the Great Depression}}

On April 17, 2009, the then head of the IMF [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]] said that there was a chance that certain countries may not implement the proper policies to avoid feedback mechanisms that could eventually turn the recession into a depression. "The free-fall in the global economy may be starting to abate, with a recovery emerging in 2010, but this depends crucially on the right policies being adopted today." The IMF pointed out that unlike the Great Depression, this recession was synchronised by global integration of markets. Such synchronized recessions were explained to last longer than typical economic downturns and have slower recoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = Evans |first = Ambrose |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/recession/5166956/IMF-warns-over-parallels-to-Great-Depression.html |title = IMF warns over parallels to Great Depression |work=The Daily Telegraph |date = April 16, 2009 |accessdate = January 21, 2010 |location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Olivier Blanchard]], IMF Chief Economist, stated that the percentage of workers laid off for long stints has been rising with each downturn for decades but the figures have surged this time. "Long-term unemployment is alarmingly high: in the United States, half the unemployed have been out of work for over six months, something we have not seen since the Great Depression." The IMF also stated that a link between rising inequality within Western economies and deflating demand may exist. The last time that the wealth gap reached such skewed extremes was in 1928–1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/8000561/IMF-fears-social-explosion-from-world-jobs-crisis.html|title=IMF fears 'social explosion' from world jobs crisis|date=September 13, 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Moldova}}

The '''Independence of Moldova''' was officially recognized on March 2, 1992, when [[Moldova]] gained membership of the [[United Nations]].  The nation had declared its independence from the Soviet Union on August 27, 1991, and was a co-founder of the post-Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States.  Moldova became fully independent from the Soviet Union that December, and joined the United Nations three months later.

== Background ==
[[File:Stamp of Moldova md394-6a.jpg|thumb|left]]

In the new political conditions created after 1985 by the [[glasnost]] policy introduced by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in 1986 to support [[perestroika]] (restructuring), a [[Democratic Movement of Moldova]] ({{lang-ro|Mişcarea Democratică din Moldova}}) was formed, which in 1989 became known as the nationalist [[Popular Front of Moldova]] (FPM; {{lang-ro|Frontul Popular din Moldova}}).&lt;ref name="lang matei"&gt;{{ro}} Horia C. Matei, "State lumii. Enciclopedie de istorie." Meronia, Bucureşti, 2006, p. 292-294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://dev.eurac.edu:8085/mugs2/do/blob.pdf?type=pdf&amp;serial=1047909431571 Romanian Nationalism in the Republic of Moldova] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011752/http://dev.eurac.edu:8085/mugs2/do/blob.pdf?type=pdf&amp;serial=1047909431571 |date=2007-09-27 }}" by Andrei Panici, American University in Bulgaria, 2002; pages 40 and 41&lt;/ref&gt; Along with several other Soviet republics, from 1988 onwards, Moldova started to move towards independence. On August 27, 1989, the FPM organized a mass demonstration in [[Chişinău]], that became known as the Great National Assembly ({{lang-ro|Marea Adunare Naţională}}), which pressured the authorities of the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]] to adopt a language law on August 31, 1989, that proclaimed the [[Moldovan language]] written in the Latin script to be the state language of the MSSR. Its identity with the [[Romanian language]] was also established.&lt;ref name="lang matei"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lang law"&gt;[http://www.iatp.md/ladom/downloads/M3.doc Legea cu privire la functionarea limbilor vorbite pe teritoriul RSS Moldovenesti Nr.3465-XI din 01.09.89 Vestile nr.9/217, 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219024839/http://www.iatp.md/ladom/downloads/M3.doc |date=2006-02-19 }} (Law regarding the usage of languages spoken on the territory of the Republic of Moldova): ''"Moldavian SSR supports the desire of the Moldovans that live across the borders of the Republic, and considering the existing linguistic Moldo-Romanian identity — of the Romanians that live on the territory of the USSR, of doing their studies and satisfying their cultural needs in their native language."''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Moldavian Supreme Soviet election, 1990|first independent elections]] for the local parliament were held in February and March 1990. [[Mircea Snegur]] was elected as speaker of the parliament, and [[Mircea Druc]] as prime minister. On June 23, 1990, the parliament adopted the Declaration of Sovereignty of the Soviet Socialist Republic Moldova, which, among other things, stipulated the supremacy of Moldovan laws over those of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="lang matei"/&gt; After the failure of the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt]], on August 27, 1991, Moldova declared its independence. On December 21 of the same year Moldova, along with most of the former Soviet republics, signed the constitutive act that formed the post-Soviet [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS). Moldova became fully independent from the Soviet Union on December 25, 1991. The following day the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Declaring itself a [[neutral state]], it did not join the military branch of the CIS. Three months later, on March 2, 1992, the country gained formal recognition as an independent state at the [[United Nations]]. In 1994, Moldova became a member of [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]] program and also a member of the [[Council of Europe]] on June 29, 1995.&lt;ref name="lang matei"/&gt;

== Declaration of Independence of Moldova ==
{{main|Declaration of Independence of Moldova}}

The [[Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Moldova]] was a document adopted by the [[Parliament of the Republic of Moldova]] following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. The document claims "millenary history" and "uninterrupted statehood" within historic and ethnic borders.

[[Moldova|The Republic of Moldova]] gained official recognition of statehood on March 2, 1992, when gaining membership of the [[United Nations]].

==Disputed status of Transnistria==
[[Image:TransnistrianRegionMap.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Transnistria]]n region of Moldova]]
{{Main|Transnistria}}

The Moldovan Declaration of Independence clearly and directly claims Moldovan [[sovereignty]] over the territory of [[Transnistria]] as it is "a component part of the historical and ethnic territory of our people". However, the Moldovan Declaration of Independence is itself used as an argument against Moldovan sovereignty over Transnistria as it denounces the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|agreement of August 23, 1939]], between the government of the [[Soviet Union]] and the government of [[Nazi Germany]], the only formal mention of the union between the two territories, "null and void" .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiraspoltimes.com/news/former_assr_pridnestrovie_reminds_moldova_you_yourself_denounced_our_union.html Tiraspol Times; Former ASSR Pridnestrovie reminds Moldova: "You yourself denounced our union"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indianapolis Early Music (IEM)''' is a non-profit organization established  in [[Indianapolis]] in 1966 to organize concerts featuring music of the [[medieval]], [[renaissance]], [[baroque]], and early classic eras. Since 1966, it has produced the annual Indianapolis Early Music Festival, the oldest continuous Early Music festival in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuvo.net/arts/article/indianapolis-early-music-festival-first-weekend-reviewed Nuvo Newsweekly article 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its annual summer festival spans three weekends and features American and international performers who perform on instruments of the period. Beyond the festival, IEM also presents other Early Music concerts throughout the year while also fostering educational programs in Indianapolis schools.

==History==
Indianapolis Early Music, originally known by its corporate name of the Festival Music Society, was founded in 1966 to provide music during the summer months when the [[Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra]], now one of the few full-year U.S. orchestras, was on vacation. The IEM initially concentrated on the major works of the baroque era, such as Bach, Handel and Vivaldi. The range of music presented was soon expanded to include that of the Renaissance and Medieval periods. 

Music played at IEM concerts is that of works generally composed between 900 AD and 1800 AD. Performances have included [[vocal music]], both choral and solo; [[Instrumental|instrumental music]], both ensemble and solo; and dance, court, folk and ballet. Among the more noteworthy early concerts was the 1977 performance of the cycle of seven Bach Partitas by harpsichordist [[Igor Kipnis]] in Indianapolis just before making his Grammy-nominated recordings of them for Angel Records.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Baker’s Biographical Dictionary of 20th Century Classical Musicians (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outreach==
IEM has a long association with public radio. Selections of IEM concerts throughout the United States and Canada are broadcast on the program [[Performance Today]]. Selections are regularly featured on the [[WFIU]]'s nationally distributed Early Music program, ''Harmonia''.&lt;ref&gt;http://indianapublicmedia.org/harmonia/highlights-2009-indianapolis-early-music-festival/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, IEM has conducted workshops in Early Music and dance, presented a symposium and exposition of historical musical instruments, and sponsored the Collegiate Virtuoso competition. In 2016, it co-presented the International Baroque Competition of Indianapolis with the Indianapolis Baroque Orchestra.  Prizes include a $10,000 first prize presented by the Gerber family.

==Artistic and music directors==
The position of IEM music director was held by Frank Cooper for 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://129.171.228.57/fmi/xsl/Faculty/out.xsl?-db=faculty&amp;-lay=fac&amp;NameLast=Cooper&amp;NameFirst=Frank&amp;-find&lt;/ref&gt; A former member of the faculty of [[Butler University]], Cooper is currently Research Professor of Music in the Department of Musicology at the [[University of Miami]] in Coral Gables, Florida and Associate Curator of Fine Arts at the [[Villa Vizcaya|Vizcaya Museum]] in Miami, Florida.

In 2008, IEM appointed Mark Cudek as its Artistic Director following Cooper's retirement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peabody.jhu.edu/398&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 recipient of Early Music America's Thomas Binkley Award for outstanding contributions to Early Music education, Cudek is the Director of the [[Peabody Conservatory]]'s Early Music department at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. Cudek is a performer specializing in guitar, recorder, crumhorn, bass viol, and percussion. Among the groups he has toured with are Hesperus, Apollo's Fire, Catacoustic Consort, and the Baltimore Consort. Cudek is actively involved in the Peabody Renaissance Ensemble and was creator and Director of the High School Early Music Program at the [[Interlochen Arts Camp]] in Michigan. He is the creator of a Masters program at Peabody; instituted a new Baroque Orchestra, and has developed an Early Music program at the [[Walters Art Museum]] in Baltimore. Mark Cudek earned a B.F.A. from the University of New York and M.Music from the Peabody Institute.

'''Kenneth Harry Dahlberg''' (June 30, 1917 – October 4, 2011) was an American businessman and highly decorated [[World War II]] [[fighter ace]].&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news |title=Miracle Ear Founder and Unwitting Watergate Figure  |last=Miller |first=Stephen |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=October 10, 2011 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204294504576617270066103558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |title=Kenneth Dahlberg |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=December 27, 2011 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/air-force-obituaries/8979423/Kenneth-Dahlberg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to reporter [[Bob Woodward]], a check made out to Dahlberg was a key part in connecting the [[Watergate scandal]] to President [[Richard Nixon]]'s re-election campaign, though Dahlberg himself was not accused of any wrongdoing.

==Early life==
Born in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], Dahlberg grew up on a farm near the village of [[Wilson, St. Croix County, Wisconsin|Wilson, Wisconsin]] and attended classes in a [[one-room school]] for 11 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mygatewaynews.com/main.asp?SectionID=2&amp;subsectionID=40&amp;articleID=377 Wilson's Ken Dahlberg park to be dedicated]&lt;/ref&gt; During his senior year, he moved back to Saint Paul to live with an aunt in order to graduate from an accredited high school ([[Harding Senior High School (St. Paul, Minnesota)|Harding High School]]). After graduation in 1935, he worked in the hotel business, starting as a dishwasher and working his way up to food and beverage manager for a hotel chain.&lt;ref name=refStavig2003&gt;{{cite web|last=Stavig |first=Vicki |date=July 1, 2003 |title=Kenneth Dahlberg – Still Airborne |work=Twin Cities Business – 2003 Minnesota Business Hall of Fame |url=http://www.tcbmag.com/halloffame/minnesotabusinesshalloffame/104302p1.aspx |accessdate=March 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016135648/http://www.tcbmag.com/halloffame/minnesotabusinesshalloffame/104302p1.aspx |archivedate=October 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
Dahlberg was drafted into the [[United States Army|army]] in 1941. He eventually became an aviation cadet in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF), where one of his instructors was future [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Barry Goldwater]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnlegion.org/paper/html/dahlberg.html The Minnesota American Legion and Auxiliary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814045326/http://www.mnlegion.org/paper/html/dahlberg.html |date=2007-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After training, Dahlberg flew the [[P-47 Thunderbolt]] and [[P-51 Mustang]] with the USAAF 353rd Fighter Squadron, 354th Fighter Group [[Ninth Air Force]] in [[Europe]]. A fighter ace, he was credited with 14 aerial victories.&lt;ref name=stripes&gt;{{cite news|author= Robbins, Seth|url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=68957 |title=Plane’s remnants unearthed, and a pilot’s tale emerges|work= [[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]] |edition=Online |date= March 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was shot down three times. The first time, he bailed out near Paris and was sheltered by the [[French Resistance]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; Disguised as a woman,&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; he rode a bicycle to Allied lines {{convert|40|mi|km}} away.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

He received numerous awards and decorations, including the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for leading a flight of 16 P-47 Thunderbolts (354th) against an attack of 70 German [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters on December 19, 1944, during the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. Dahlberg accounted for four enemy planes that day, but was himself shot down.  He was rescued by [[Martin Dardis]] and four other American soldiers.&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;{{cite news |title=Martin F. Dardis, 83; Investigator Linked Watergate Crime to Nixon |last=Sullivan |first=Patricia |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=May 19, 2006 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/martin-f-dardis-83-investigator-linked-watergate-crime-to-nixon/2012/05/31/gJQAUJZwFV_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many years after the war, both Dardis and Dahlberg became key figures in the [[Watergate scandal]].&lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt;

On February 14, 1945, Dahlberg was downed for the third and final time, near [[Bitburg]], and became a [[prisoner of war]] for the final three months of the war.&lt;ref name=stripes/&gt;

Continuing his military service after the war, Dahlberg served with the Minnesota [[Air National Guard]] until 1951.

==Business career==
Dahlberg went to work for [[Telex Communications|Telex]], a company that made [[hearing aids]].&lt;ref name=refStavig2003/&gt; In 1948, he founded [[Dahlberg Electronics]], a subsidiary of which is the [[Miracle-Ear]] hearing aids manufacturer. By 1959, Miracle-Ear had evolved into a subsidiary of Dahlberg, Inc., with $100 million in annual revenue. A national advertising campaign that Dahlberg, Inc. ran from 1988 until mid-1993 was subject to charges of [[false advertising]] by the [[Federal Trade Commission]], which were settled in 1995 when the company agreed to pay a $2.75 million civil penalty.&lt;ref name=refFTC1995&gt;{{cite web|publisher=U.S. Federal Trade Commission |date=1995-11-21 |title=FTC Garners $2.75 Million Civil Penalty In Settlement Of False Advertising Charges Against Maker Of "Miracle-Ear" Hearing Aids |url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1995/11/dahl2.shtm |accessdate=2010-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606160051/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1995/11/dahl2.shtm |archivedate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1993,&lt;ref name=refFTC1995/&gt; Dahlberg sold his company to [[Bausch &amp; Lomb]] for $139 million.&lt;ref name=refStavig2003/&gt;

In 1995, Dahlberg started the venture capital firm Carefree Capital, whose investments include the [[Buffalo Wild Wings]] restaurant chain.&lt;ref name=refStavig2003/&gt; As of 2010, Dahlberg lived in [[Carefree, Arizona]], and still piloted a [[Cessna Citation]] jet.&lt;ref name=stripes/&gt;

==Watergate==
During the Watergate investigation by ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]], chronicled in ''[[All the President's Men]]'', Bernstein traveled to [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] to see Martin Dardis, the head investigator for [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]] [[District Attorney]] Richard E. Gerstein. Since most of the Watergate burglars were from Miami, the district attorney's office had launched an investigation. Dardis showed Bernstein a photostatic copy of a cashier's check for $25,000 that had been deposited into the bank account of a real estate firm owned by [[Bernard Barker]], one of the Watergate burglars. The check was drawn on a [[Boca Raton]], [[Florida]], bank and was made out to Kenneth H. Dahlberg. Bernstein telephoned this information to Woodward who was back at the ''Washington Post'' in [[Washington, D.C.]]

Woodward got Dahlberg's telephone number from information and called him&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/online/woodstein/post/dahlberg_detail.html Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas]&lt;/ref&gt; at home. At first, Dahlberg did not believe Woodward was actually a reporter. He later called Woodward back and explained that his neighbor, [[Virginia_Piper_kidnapping|Virginia Piper]], had been recently kidnapped,&lt;ref&gt;[http://events.mnhs.org/bookofdays/?eventID=759 Minnesota Historical Society ]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was an upsetting experience. Dahlberg told Woodward he had the check made out to himself while he was in Florida on business and did not want to carry that much cash around. Dahlberg could not explain how the check got into Barker's bank account, but said it was given to either the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]] or [[Maurice Stans]].

Dahlberg was the Midwest finance chairman for the Committee to Re-elect the President during [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard M. Nixon]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 campaign]]. In 1968, he was the finance chairman for [[Clark MacGregor]]'s unsuccessful [[United States Senate|Senate]] campaign in Minnesota. MacGregor was later appointed the head of the Committee to Re-elect the President in 1972, after former attorney general [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]] had resigned. 

It was later learned that the $25,000 came from [[Dwayne Andreas]], chief executive officer of [[Archer Daniels Midland]], as an anonymous donation to the Nixon campaign. Woodward has said that finding Dahlberg's check was a turning point in their investigation because it led to the discovery of how the Watergate burglars were financed through a [[money laundering]] scheme.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

Dahlberg was never charged with any wrongdoing in the Watergate scandal.&lt;ref name=stripes/&gt;

==Death==
Dahlberg died on October 4, 2011, at his [[Deephaven, Minnesota]] home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ken-dahlberg-miracle-ear-founder-and-unwitting-watergate-figure-dies-at-94/2011/10/06/gIQAgOCQRL_story.html |title=Ken Dahlberg, Miracle Ear founder and unwitting Watergate figure, dies at 94 |last=Shapiro |first=T. Rees |newspaper=Washington Post |date=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his wife of 64 years, Betty Jayne (née Segerstrom), two daughters, and a son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kenneth H.

==Honors==
In 1967, Dahlberg was notified by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] that he had earned the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] in 1945, but it was not presented to him at that time because he was a prisoner of war. Dahlberg also earned the [[Silver Star]], two [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]es, two [[Purple Heart]]s, 16 [[Air Medal]]s, and the French [[Croix de Guerre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valor Awards for Kenneth H.

In 1970, President Richard Nixon appointed Dahlberg to the board of visitors of the [[United States Air Force Academy|U.S. Air Force Academy]]. He also served as a trustee of [[Hamline University]].

In 1996, Dahlberg was inducted into the [[Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame]] at the [[Norsk Høstfest]] in [[Minot, North Dakota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hostfest.com/awards/hall-of-fame/kenneth-dahlberg/ |title=Kenneth Dahlberg |publisher=Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted into the [[Minnesota Aviation Hall of Fame]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mnaviationhalloffame.org/HoFPages/hofD1.html |title=Kenneth H.

In July 2007, he was featured in the aviation series ''[[Dogfights (TV series)|Dogfights]]'' on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]], in the final segment of the episode on the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47 Thunderbolt]]. In 2009, Dahlberg was inducted into the [[Arizona Aviation Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supersabresociety.com/bomb150209.pdf Super Sabre Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208023842/http://www.supersabresociety.com/bomb150209.pdf |date=2011-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Kenneth H. Dahlberg Memorial to Service was built and constructed at [[Hamline University]], where Dahlberg served as a life trustee and played an integral part in its construction.

The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Captain (Air Corps) Kenneth H. Dahlberg, United States Army Air Forces, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy while serving as Pilot of a P-47 Fighter Airplane in the 353d Fighter Squadron, 354th Fighter Group, NINTH Air Force, in aerial combat against enemy forces on 19 December 1944, over Germany. On that date, Captain Dahlberg was serving as flight commander during an armed reconnaissance mission near Trier, Germany, when a formation of more than ninety enemy fighters was observed. Despite the enemy's vast numerical superiority, Captain Dahlberg led his eight-ship flight in a direct attack upon the hostile force. Although his wingman was forced to break combat, Captain Dahlberg relentlessly attacked the enemy, destroying four of their aircraft and damaging another. The extraordinary heroism and determination of this officer to destroy the enemy are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, the 9th Air Force, and the United States Army Air Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=23037 |title=Kenneth Harry Dahlberg |website=valor.militarytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''La Cruz Blanca Neutral''' (''The Neutral White Cross'') was a volunteer infirmary and relief service established during the [[Mexican Revolution]] to care for those wounded in the conflict. The [[Red Cross]] refused to treat insurgents and the Neutral White Cross was developed to treat all combatants. After their initial success in [[Ciudad Juárez]], the organisation spread out through 25 states in Mexico for the duration of the war. It continued as a quasi-governmentally subsidised organisation into the 1940s, when it was converted into an organisation to assist children. The organisation is still operating in [[Mexico City]].

==Formation==
La Cruz Blanca Neutral was a volunteer infirmary and relief service founded by [[Elena Arizmendi Mejia]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="Collado Soto (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collado Soto|first1=Juan Rodolfo|title=Historia de la Enfermería: Se Llamaba Elena Arizmendi|journal=Desarrollo Cientif Enferm|date=April 2012|volume= 20|issue= 3|pages=102–106|url=http://www.index-f.com/dce/20pdf/20-102.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vasconcelos (2000)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vasconcelos|first1=José|title=Ulises Criollo|date=2000|publisher=ALLCA XX, Université Paris X|location=Nanterre|isbn=2-914-273-00-2|page=552|edition=1.|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=XtILiIqwDFAC&amp;lpg=PA540&amp;ots|language=Spanish|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=impacto&gt;{{cite book|title=Impacto de la Revolución mexicana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rSuT3sarl24C&amp;pg=PA97|year=2011|publisher=Siglo XXI Editores|isbn=978-607-03-0250-3|pages=97–}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was enrolled at the School of Nursing of the Santa Rosa Hospital (now the School of Nursing at the [[University of the Incarnate Word]]) in [[San Antonio, Texas]] when the war broke out. Her school was next door to the Texas residence of her family friend whom she supported, [[Francisco I. Madero]], who challenged [[Porfirio Díaz]] for the presidency in 1910, was jailed by Díaz but escaped and fled to Texas.&lt;ref name="Nance (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nance|first1=Douglas C|title=Enfermeras del Hospital General de México a la Revolución|journal=Rev Enferm Inst Mex Seguro|date=2010|volume= 18|issue= 2|pages=111–115|url=http://www.medigraphic.com/pdfs/enfermeriaimss/eim-2010/eim102i.pdf|accessdate=28 March 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of the war, casualties and the refusal of the [[Red Cross]] to treat insurgents,&lt;ref name="Newark (1911)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Factional Fight May Be Started|url=http://www.myheritage.com/research/collection-10025/newspaper-archive?itemId=346624487&amp;action=showRecord|accessdate=28 March 2015|issue=Vol. 43|publisher=The Newark Advocate|date=23 May 1911|location=Newark, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused Arizmendi to return to [[Mexico City]] via train on 17 April 1911. Once there, she arranged a personal meeting with the head of the Red Cross organisation. When the director reiterated that they would not treat revolutionaries, Arizmendi decided to found an organisation that ''would'' treat her countrymen. She and her brother, Carlos, rallied medical students and nurses to the cause.&lt;ref name="Nance (2010)" /&gt;

They formed an association under the guidelines of the [[Geneva Conventions]] and she acted as fundraiser, enlisting the help of celebrities like [[María Conesa]], [[Virginia Fábregas]], and [[Leopoldo Beristáin]]. After numerous fundraising events, they had collected sufficient funds for a field hospital and on 11 May 1911, set off for [[Ciudad Juárez]]. Arizmendi and Carlos, formed the first brigade with Dr. Ignacio Barrios and Dr. Antonio Márquez and nurses María Avon, Juana Flores Gallardo, Atilana García, Elena de Lange, and Tomasa Villareal. The second brigade, led by Dr. Francisco, left the following day and on the 14th a third brigade, headed by Dr. Lorenzo and ten nurses including Inocenta Díaz, Concepción Ibáñez, Jovita Muñiz, Concepción Sánchez, María Sánchez, Basilia Vélez, María Vélez and Antonia Zorilla, set off for Juárez. Arriving in the city, they found devastation and again Arizmendi had to rally for funds.&lt;ref name="Nance (2010)" /&gt;

==Ciudad de Juárez==
Utilising buildings and supplies secured from the rebels at the Hospital de Jesús, Hospital Juárez, and the medical student dormitories and pharmacies, the brigades swiftly set to work. American medics from nearby [[El Paso, Texas]] formed the ''Hospital Insurrecto'' (Insurgent's Hospital) near the border. The devastation of the city and so many wounded strained the supplies and Arizmendi again rallied for funding.&lt;ref name="Nance (2010)" /&gt;

A homeopathic doctor, Laglera, established Hospital Libertad (Liberty Hospital) to deal with wounded and typhus patients. He was assisted by nurses Rebeca Guillén, and the Vélez sisters and Zorilla who had come in the 3rd brigade. Nurses Rhoda Miller,
Francés M. Readi, Teodora J. Velarde and Tomasa Villareal from the first brigade formed the surgical nurse team. There were twenty nurses assigned to work in the City of Juarez: María Avon, Inocenta Díaz, Juana Flores Gallardo, Atilana García, Rebeca Guillén, Concepción Ibáñez, Elena de Lange, Rhoda Miller, Jovita Muñiz, Telésfora Pérez, Francés M. Readi, Amelia Rodríguez, Concepción
Sánchez, María Sánchez, Teodora J. Velarde, Basilia Vélez, María Vélez, Loreto Vélez, Tomasa Villarreal y Antonia Zorilla. In the 11th and 4th infirmary, at the Insurgent's Hospital were Tomasita F. de Aguirre, Esther Concha, Josefina Espalin, Guadalupe G. Vda. de Gameros, María Gaskey, Libradita Leyva, Bernardina S. de Leyva, Máxima de Martínez, Juanita Nápoles, Anita L. Robert and Adela Vásquez
Schiaffino, who was a journalist.&lt;ref name="Nance (2010)" /&gt;

The brigade traveling with Madero included Manuel Realivásquez, Juan Anaya, Silvano N. Córdova, José María Delgado, and Dick Brown. Finally the nurses who made rounds for those who refused to go to hospitals included Guadalupe G. Vda. de Gameros, Señora Salazar de Harry, Laura Nájera de Morgan y Belem G. de Realivásquez.&lt;ref name="Nance (2010)" /&gt;

==Expansion through Mexico==
On 7 June 1911 a massive earthquake struck Mexico and the members of the White Cross rushed to the epicenter in [[Iguala]], Guerrero to offer assistance. By the end of 1911, the Neutral White Cross had established 25 brigades across Mexico. Arzimendi was elected as the first woman partner of the [[Sociedad Mexicana de Geografía y Estadística]], but she rejected the honour. She did accept a gold medal presented to her for dedication with helping the wounded by the ''Gran Liga Obrera'' (Grand League of Obrera). Ironically, in 1912, the Swiss Confederation of the International Red Cross presented Silver Medals to the nurses who had served in Chihuahua, Guerrero and Morelos with the White Cross. In 1913, factionalism between male doctors who did not want to follow orders from a woman,&lt;ref name="Nance (2010)" /&gt; split those supporting Arizmendi and those supporting Dr. Marquez into opposing camps. Arizmendi consulted a young attorney, [[José Vasconcelos]], who would later become [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Mexico's Secretary of Education]]. Arizmendi withdrew and moved to [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Collado Soto (2012)" /&gt;

A later brigade was founded by [[Leonor Villegas de Magnon|Leonor Villegas de Magnón]] in 1913 that aided soldiers along both sides of the Texas-Mexican border near [[Laredo, Texas]]. A close-knit group of women and American doctors who helped the wounded during fighting,&lt;ref name="Guerra2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=María Eugenia Guerra|title=Historic Laredo: An Illustrated History of Laredo &amp; Webb County|date=June 1, 2001|publisher=HPN Books|isbn=978-1-893619-16-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; treated the wounded in Magnón's home, which had already been a makeshift kindergarten classroom.&lt;ref name="McArthurSmith2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Judith N.

She made it understood that selling negatives or pictures was out of the question.&lt;ref name="MagnónLomas1994" /&gt; In further strides to preserve the history of Cruz Blanca, Magnón wrote ''The Rebel'', a third-person memoir and account of the activities of Cruz Blanca. Unfortunately her manuscript was not published in her lifetime for many reasons, one of them including unconventional gender roles. It was not until 1994 when [[Arte Publico Press]] would pick up the manuscript from her granddaughter.&lt;ref name="MagnónLomas1994" /&gt;

==Current organisation==
In 1948, Arizmendi changed the direction of the White Cross, due to governmental indifference. Since 1942, the only funding had come from the benefactor, Rodolfo Brito Fourcher.&lt;ref name="Collado Soto (2012)" /&gt; The White Cross, still exists in [[Coyoacán]] one of the neighborhoods of Mexico City. The institution is dedicated to the care and rehabilitation of children with severe malnutrition problems.&lt;ref name="Nance (2010)" /&gt;

This is a '''list of modern conflicts in the Middle East''' ensuing in the geographic and political region known as the [[Middle East]]. The "Middle East" is traditionally defined as the [[Fertile Crescent]] ([[Mesopotamia]]), [[Levant]], and [[Egypt]] and neighboring areas of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], [[Anatolia]] and [[Iran]]. It currently encompasses the area from Egypt, [[Turkey]] and [[Cyprus]] in the west to Iran and the [[Persian Gulf]] in the east,&lt;ref&gt;Albert Hourani et al., ''The Modern Middle East: A Reader.'' 1993: p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and from Turkey and Iran in the north, to [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]] in the south.
* Conflicts are separate incidents with at least 100 casualties, and are listed by total deaths, including sub-conflicts.&lt;ref name="warlist"/&gt;
* The term "modern" refers to the post-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period,  in other words, since 1918.

With farmland, crops, livestock, and infrastructure destroyed, as many as 2 million Iranians died of famine at the war’s end. Although the Russian Revolution of 1917 led to the recall of Russian troops, and thus gave hope to Iranians that the foreign yoke might be relenting, the British quickly moved to fill the vacuum in the north, and by 1918, had turned the country into an unofficial protectorate."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2014|p=123}}: "As the Great War came to its close in the fall of 1918, Iran’s plight was woeful.

Famine killed as many as two million Iranians out of a population of little more than ten million.”&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''See [[The Tramp]] for the character played by [[Charlie Chaplin]]''.

'''''Little Tramp''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with a book by [[David Pomeranz]] and [[Steven David Horwich]] and music and lyrics by David Pomeranz.

Based on the life of comedian [[Charles Chaplin]] and named after his [[The Tramp|most famous character]], it opens at the 1971 [[Academy Awards]] ceremony at which the aging star, long exiled from the [[United States]], is about to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award. The trajectory of the impressive professional career and turbulent private life that leads to this moment is traced via [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s in which Chaplin recalls his introduction to Hollywood and [[silent movie]]s, his failed marriages and problems with the press, his dealings with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and the creation of his most beloved character, the iconic Little Tramp.    
 
In 1992, in order to create interest in a staged production, Pomeranz gathered together what he referred to as his "dream cast" and recorded a CD of the score.  Artists participating in the project included [[Petula Clark]], [[Lea Salonga]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Mel Brooks]], [[Treat Williams]], and [[Peter Duncan (actor)|Peter Duncan]] as Chaplin. It was released on the Warner Music UK Ltd. label.

''Little Tramp'' received its first staging in 1995 at the prestigious [[Eugene O'Neill]] Theater Festival in [[Waterford, Connecticut]] (Eugene O'Neill having been the father of Chaplin's wife, [[Oona O'Neill]]). The following year, a concert version was presented in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]] to inaugurate the world's first East/West Musical Theater Conference.

The show was first performed in the UK by Imagine Productions in Preston, and was endorsed by Richard Attenborough, director of the biopic ''[[Chaplin (film)|Chaplin]]''.

==Synopsis==
At the 1971 [[Academy Awards]] ceremony in Los Angeles, an 82-year-old Charlie Chaplin is about to receive a special Life Achievement award. 20 years earlier, Charlie had been barred from re-entry into the United States on the grounds that he was a Communist ("In America Again").

Charlie looks back at his life. His mother, a failed music hall performer, trying to make ends meet to support little Charlie and his older brother Sydney, reminds her sons that they have something more than mere material possessions ("Something No One Can Ever Take Away").

Not able to support her children, Hanna Chaplin is taken to the workhouse. The boys try selling their old clothing on the streets but there are no takers. Hungry and heartbroken, Sydney tries to cheer things up ("When the World Stops Turning") while the Charlie of 1971 rejoins them.

When Sydney joined the Navy, Charlie is left to fend for himself. Determined to help his mother, Charlie joined a dance troupe called "The Eight Lancashire Lads", but his mother's condition worsens and she is placed in an insane asylum. Dodging truant officers, Charlie sees a sign, "Blackmore's Theatrical Agency" and barges into the agent's office ("Number One").

Now grown up and a consummate English Stage comedian, Charlie is discovered by filmmaker [[Mack Sennett]] and signed to a contract at [[Keystone Studios]] in California. Sennett's style of "pie in the face" comedy is different from Chaplin's slower, more deliberate style, and when Charlie tries to assert his ideas, Sennett gives him some strong advice ("Less It Ends With a Chase").

Charlie is relentless. Sennett finally throws up his hands in frustration and gives Charlie a chance ("The Tramp"/"He's Got to be Someone").

Charlie becomes an overnight sensation. Film distributors, fans and theater owners can't get enough of him ("Chaplin Films").

Charlie opens his own picture studio and he becomes one of the most beloved public figures.  One evening, he is visited by a local chapter of Chaplin Fan Club ("Thank You").

By this time, Sydney returns as Charlie's personal manager. Getting ready for a swank Hollywood party, Sydney reminisces how far they've come ("Heaven").

Back to 1971, Charlie's wife, Oona is instructed by the show's assistant director on how Charlie should play to the camera. Furthermore, a government official then warns her that Charlie should avoid making any political comments. Oona is incensed ("He's Got to be Someone (Reprise)").

The story returns to the 1920s. Charlie's career and personal life are at a low point. His mother just died, and he just underwent two bitter divorces. He is overworked, reporters are on to him and to make things worse, talking pictures are threatening his artistic survival ("Too Many Words").

Nonetheless his success continued, and Charlie revisits England to attend a Royal Premiere of ''[[City Lights]]''. He wanders through his old neighborhood and is stunned that injustice and poverty still exists. In an effort to improve such degenerate conditions, he decides to speak out on behalf of the [[Russian War Relief]]. He contends that it's no concern whether or not these people are Communist, they're being slaughtered by the Nazis. After one of his speeches, [[FBI]] agent Tippy Gray takes notes and reports his finding to Bureau Chief [[J. Edgar Hoover]] ("I Got Me a Red"/"There's Got to be a Law").

A paternity suit is filed against Chaplin, giving Hoover ammunition he needed. Although a blood test disproves the allegation, the press crucifies him. His fans turn on him and his films are boycotted. Charlie is dejected. He is convinced that it is just a matter of time before his new wife Oona leaves him too. However. Oona assures him that she won't ("This is What I Dreamed").

The Chaplins decided to cruise Europe, but aboard the ship, Charlie receives a cable from Washington stating that in order to re-enter the U.S., he must answer to political and moral charges. Crestfallen, Charlie decided to spend the next 20 years living in [[Veney]], [[Switzerland]].

Back to 1971, Charlie is escorted to the stage while deeply regarding what he will tell his audience ("Finale").

'''[[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]]''' disappeared on 8 March 2014, after departing from [[Kuala Lumpur]] for [[Beijing]], with 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Search for MH370|url=http://gis.usc.edu/msp-resources/infographics/the-search-for-malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370/|website=University of Southern California|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia's former [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]], [[Najib Razak]], has stated that the aircraft's flight ended somewhere in the Indian Ocean, but no further explanation has been given.&lt;ref name="UnsuccessfulSearch"&gt;{{cite news|title=Missing Malaysia Airline plane wreckage not in identified area|url=http://www.malaysiasun.com/index.php/sid/222436235/scat/48cba686fe041718/ht/Missing-Malaysia-Airline-plane-wreckage-not-in-identified-area|accessdate=29 May 2014|publisher=''Malaysia Sun''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official announcements have been questioned by many critics, and several theories about the disappearance have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/malaysia-airlines-flight-370-flight-ended-in-southern-indian-ocean-prime-minister-says/ | title=Grief, anger and more questions after Malaysia declares Flight 370 crashed | work=[[CBS News]] | date=24 March 2014| accessdate=24 March 2014| agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these have been described as [[conspiracy theories]].&lt;ref name=Brotherton2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=suntimes2014/&gt; The incident remains under investigation.

==Background==
{{Main|Malaysia Airlines Flight 370}}
Victims' relatives have questioned the veracity of the [[Government of Malaysia|Malaysian government's]] statements about the demise of the aircraft, and organized a protest at the Malaysian embassy in [[Beijing]] with the goal of forcing the Malaysian government to reveal any withheld information about Flight 370's whereabouts.

Rob Brotherton, a lecturer in psychology at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]], wrote that conspiracy theories emerge immediately after any catastrophe occurs and conclusive information about why they do so remains unavailable.&lt;ref name=Brotherton2014&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25260-flight-mh370-the-allure-of-the-conspiracy-theory.html| title=Flight MH370: The allure of the conspiracy theory | work=New Scientist | date=20 March 2014| accessdate=25 March 2014| author=Brotherton, Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Leonard]] wrote that conspiracy theorists were bolstered by the revelation of new satellite data two weeks after the flight disappeared that had been hidden from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/2014/03/24/quit_it_conspiracy_theorists_mh370_wasnt_the_result_of_a_shadowy_plot/ | title=Quit it, conspiracy theorists: MH370 wasn't the result of a shadowy plot | work=Salon | date=24 March 2014| accessdate=24 March 2014| author=Leonard, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other factors involve the lack of a [[distress signal]] from the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://time.com/20351/missing-plane-flight-mh370-5-conspiracy-theories/ | title=The Missing Malaysian Plane: 5 Conspiracy Theories | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=11 March 2014 | accessdate=13 May 2014 | author=Sam Frizell}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Barbara Demick]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', critics of the Malaysian government's statements also found support in the [[Joint Agency Coordination Centre]]'s announcement on 29 May 2014 that the plane was not in the search area authorities had been combing since April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-malaysia-flight-mh370-search-20140529-story.html | title=Missing Malaysia Airlines jet not in search area, officials say | work=Los Angeles Times | date=29 May 2014 | accessdate=4 June 2014 | author=Demick, Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism and response===
Conspiracy-focused internet sites claim that the official statement that the plane crashed into the Indian Ocean makes no sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Now Clearly A Government Cover-Up: All Evidence Contradicts Official Story|url=http://www.eyeopening.info/2014/03/25/malaysia-airlines-flight-370-now-clearly-government-cover-evidence-contradicts-official-story/|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They note that a [[Boeing 777]] does not have the structural integrity to survive crashing into the ocean, and that it would be comparable to hitting a concrete wall at [[terminal velocity]]. If Flight 370 hit the ocean, they say, it would have been broken into tens of thousands of pieces, many of which float on water (such as the seat cushions) and would be seen washing up on regional shores or easily spotted by search teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/asia/9864556/MH370-Distrust-breeds-conspiracy-theories | title=MH370: Distrust breeds conspiracy theories | work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] | date=25 March 2014| accessdate=24 March 2014| author=Wen, Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard professor [[Cass Sunstein]] noted that the conflicting information initially released by the Malaysian government explains the interest in alternative theories.&lt;ref name="wsj-2014-03-20"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/video/flight-mh370-why-are-conspiracy-theories-seductive/BA8BBA6E-AB59-4761-933E-D672BCC0F052.html | title=Flight MH370: Why Are Conspiracy Theories Seductive? | work=Wall Street Journal | date=20 March 2014| accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunstein, who has written on the topic, argued in an interview with the ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' on 20 March 2014 that conspiracy theories in general often are borne out of horrific and disastrous situations, because such events make people angry, fearful and looking for a "target".&lt;ref name="wsj-2014-03-20"/&gt;

David Soucie, a former FAA inspector, has said that the theories that have been put forth in this matter are important when there is a lack of knowledge, as the theories and notions help us to consider various possibilities. On 26 March 2014, he stated on [[CNN]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;In an accident investigation, it's a critical part to come up with theories. Especially right now when we don't have anything. We don't have anything tangible. We don't have something to say, hey, yes – because we don't know where that airplane is and we need to find out why. If you take one theory, the airplane would be where we're looking at right now. If you take another theory, where there was nefarious intent, they're trying to avoid radars, the airplane could be somewhere else. If you say it was – whatever it is, you've got to use these theories, weigh them against the facts so you know which one to go to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1403/26/pmt.01.html CNN Transcripts] – Piers Morgan Live – 26 March 2014. Retrieved 28 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tim Black, deputy editor of ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', wrote: &amp;nbsp;"...it's in this darkness, this near absence of knowledge [about MH370], that speculation has flourished,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/flight-mh370-conspiracy-theorists-adore-a-vacuum/14812 | title=MH370: conspiracy theorists adore a vacuum | work=Spiked | date=19 March 2014| accessdate=25 March 2014| author=Black, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an editorial in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', not only stated that "conspiracy theories fill a vacuum when facts are scarce," but also urged governments to search for the plane to debunk these theories and give victims' family members peace of mind.&lt;ref name=suntimes2014&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.suntimes.com/opinions/26436099-474/conspiracy-theories-dont-help-to-understand-cause-of-malaysian-jets-disappearance.html | title=Conspiracy theories don't help to understand cause of Malaysian jet's disappearance | work=Chicago Sun-Times | date=26 March 2014| accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common hypothesis, cited also here, that MH370 avoided Indonesian radar is based only on a statement that the plane was not observed by Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/untrue-that-mh370-avoided-indonesian-radar-hishammuddin-says |title='Untrue' that MH370 avoided Indonesian radar, Hishammuddin says- Malaysia- The Malay Mail Online |author=Clara Chooi |publisher=The Malay Mail Online |date=7 April 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is easy for radar observers to visually miss an unexpected object.

==Hijacking==
The possibility of a simple hijacking has been brought up by various news outlets, including [[ABC News]] and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref name=hope&gt;{{cite web | title=Malaysia Airlines Flight 370: Hijacking theory gives relatives hope | url=http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-malaysia-airlines-flight-370-hijack-family-philip-wood-20140316,0,4194274.story | author=Barbara Demick | date=16 March 2014| publisher=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation has mounted about the possibility that hijackers took the plane to a remote island, although no group has claimed responsibility;&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; however, unofficial researchers have identified more than 600 possible runways at which the plane was capable of landing.&lt;ref name=hope/&gt; No confirmation has been received from Malaysian officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title='Deliberate Action' Diverted Missing Plane | url=http://news.sky.com/story/1226362/deliberate-action-diverted-missing-plane | date=15 March 2014| publisher=BSkyB | accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The credibility of several hijacking theories have become further marginalized following the discovery of the first definitive fragments of MH370 wreckage in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title='Deliberate Action' Diverted Missing Plane | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/11772187/MH370-debris-found-live.html | date=31 July 2015| publisher=Telegraph | accessdate=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2017,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} French air traffic specialists Jean-Marc Garot, Michel Delarche and Jean-Luc Marchand launched a website with their hypothesis concerning a possible hijacking, with a subsequent location of the aircraft (following an [[Water landing|emergency ditching]] due to fuel exhaustion) estimated at around {{Coord|12|2|32|S|107|22|48|E|display=inline}}, in the Indian Ocean near the [[Christmas Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mh370-captio.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MH370-PlausibleTrajectory-3.4.pdf MH370: An Operational study of a start to end Piloted Trajectory - A new search area], by Jean-Luc Marchand, Philippe Gasser, Michel Delarche and Jean-Marc Garot - Air Traffic Management (ATM) Experts&lt;/ref&gt; However, the final report from the [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]] (ATSB), released in 2017, examined the possibility of controlled glide/ditching and found it very unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.atsb.gov.au/media/5773565/operational-search-for-mh370_final_3oct2017.pdf The Operational Search for MH370 (Final)]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Executive summary: "It was established from the debris that the aircraft was not configured for a ditching at the end-of-flight." Page 101 (numbered): "analysis indicated that the flaps were most likely in a retracted position at the time they separated from the aircraft making a controlled ditching scenario very unlikely." --&gt; Also their hypothesis concerning a location of the crashed plane different from the searched locations is not the only one that exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Lusher | first=Adam | title=As MH370 conspiracy theories continue to swirl, why has compelling new evidence not revived the search | website=The Independent | date=2017-04-26 | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/mh370-missing-malaysia-airlines-plane-latest-new-evidence-development-conspiracy-theories-what-a7703531.html | access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic hijacking===
Electronic hijacking uses systems and programming already factory-installed within the B777 [[flight management system]]. This is different from hacking or cyber-attack in that it requires access to the B777's security system through access purposefully programmed into the software. Notable proponents of this theory include current Malaysian prime minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/missing-mh370-ex-malaysian-pm-hints-3570724 | title=Missing MH370: Ex-Malaysian PM hints at CIA conspiracy and claims 'someone is hiding something' | work=[[Daily Mirror]] | date=19 May 2014 | accessdate=20 May 2014 | author=Roberts, Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said: "Clearly Boeing and certain agencies have the capacity to take over uninterruptible control of commercial airliners of which MH370 B777 is one". In this statement he was referring to off-board hijackers with access to MH370's Flight Management System via the 2003 patented [[Boeing Honeywell Uninterruptible Autopilot (BUAP)|Uninterruptible Autopilot]].

==="Spoofed" satellite data===
Technology writer [[Jeff Wise]] has developed a theory in which the aircraft's controls were taken over by hijackers from the electronics and equipment bay, accessible through a hatch in the first-class cabin floor. Wise theorizes that the Inmarsat satellite pings were a deliberately laid false trail created by feeding the plane's satellite communications system false data which in turn caused the system to make false frequency corrections. These would, when later scrutinized, lead investigators to conclude the plane was headed south, when according to Wise's theory it actually flew north and possibly landed at [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/02/jeff-wise-mh370-theory.html |title=How crazy am I to think I actually know where that Malaysia Airlines plane is? |work=[[New York Magazine]] |date=23 Feb 2015 |accessdate=25 Feb 2015 |author=Wise, Jeff |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WbME0tcW?url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/02/jeff-wise-mh370-theory.html |archivedate=25 February 2015 |df= }} ()&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrorist attack===

Shortly after the aircraft disappeared, some news agencies reported that it may have been an act of terrorism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Was Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Lost Because of Terrorism?|url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/2014/dgreenfield/was-malaysia-airlines-flight-370-lost-because-of-terrorism/|accessdate=18 April 2014|newspaper=[[Frontpage Magazine]]|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly a [[Jihad]] attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malaysia Airline MH370: 9/11-style terror allegations resurface in case of lost plane|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/10700652/Malaysia-Airline-MH370-911-style-terror-allegations-resurface-in-case-of-lost-plane.html|accessdate=18 April 2014|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=These are all the Internet's 'best' theories on Malaysia Flight 370s disappearance|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/03/18/these-are-all-the-internets-best-theories-on-malaysia-flight-370s-disappearance/|accessdate=18 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Pamela Geller]]|title=Flight MH370: Terrorism expert backs theory of pilot suicide flight -|url=http://pamelageller.com/2014/03/flight-mh370-terrorism-expert-backs-theory-pilot-suicide-flight.html/|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Parry | first=Simon | last2=Williams | first2=Amanda | last3=Robinson | first3=Wills | title='Fanatical' missing Malaysia Airlines plane pilot pictured wearing political T-shirt | website=Daily Mail Online | date=2014-03-16 | url=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2581817/Doomed-airliner-pilot-political-fanatic-Hours-taking-control-flight-MH370-attended-trial-jailed-opposition-leader-sodomite.html | access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Between 9 and 14 March 2014, media mogul [[Rupert Murdoch]] tweeted that Flight 370's disappearance "confirms jihadists turning to make trouble for China {{sic}}." He later suggested the flight might have been hidden in northern Pakistan, "like [[Osama Bin Laden|Bin Laden]]". These remarks have not been confirmed, and were characterized as conspiracy theories by Shiv Malik in ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/16/rupert-murdoch-tweets-conspiracy-theories-flight-mh370-disappearance | title=Rupert Murdoch tweets all kinds of crazy over flight MH370 disappearance | work=The Guardian | date=16 March 2014| accessdate=25 March 2014| author=Malik, Shiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, the Russian newspaper ''[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]'' endorsed a similar theory, claiming that "unknown terrorists" had hijacked the plane, flown it to [[Afghanistan]], and then held the crew and passengers hostage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mh370-hijacked-afghanistan-russian-intelligence-3407468 | title=MH370 'hijacked and in Afghanistan': Russian intelligence source claims all passengers and crew are alive but held hostage | work=Daily Mirror | date=13 April 2014 | accessdate=27 May 2014 | author=Richards, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===North Korea===
A story circulated on [[Reddit]] that MH370 had sufficient fuel to be hijacked to [[North Korea]] as was done in 1969 with a [[Korean Air Lines YS-11 hijacking|Korean Air Lines YS-11]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hartley-Parkinson|first1=Richard | title=Flight MH370: 17 conspiracy theories 100 days on from plane's disappearance | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/flight-mh370-17-conspiracy-theories-3620032 | date=15 June 2014 | publisher=Daily Mirror | accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Masi|first1=Alessandria|title=Malaysia Air Conspiracy Theory Roundup|url=http://www.vocativ.com/world/malaysia/malaysia-air-conspiracy-theory-roundup/|accessdate=4 September 2014|publisher=[[Vocativ]]|date=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=What if flight MH370 was hijacked and diverted to North Korea? | url=https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2007dm/what_if_flight_mh370_was_hijacked_and_diverted_to | date=9 March 2014| publisher=Reddit | accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late July 2015, in an article about MH370 "conspiracy theories", ''[[The Independent]]'' briefly mentioned that it had received an email claiming the U.S. had authorized the plane to be shot down because it was allegedly carrying a [[nuclear warhead]] to North Korea, though ''The Independent'' immediately added the joke "Or it could still be aliens."&lt;ref name="Independent31July2015a"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/mh370-debris-discovery-sends-conspiracy-theories-into-overdrive-about-shotdown-plane-10430576.html |title=MH370 'debris' discovery sends conspiracy theories into overdrive about 'shot-down plane'|publisher=The Independent|author=Lizzie Dearden| date=31 July 2015|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition of Freescale staff===
A variety of social media posts and email [[chain letters]] claim that a patent (#[http://www.google.com/patents/US8671381 8671381]) was approved days after the disappearance of the MH370, and the right to the patent was split five ways – 20% to [[Freescale Semiconductor]] and 20% each to four employees, all of whom were passengers on the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/9988150/12-bizarre-MH370-conspiracy-theories|title=12 bizarre MH370 conspiracy theories|last=Pritchard|first=Tom|work=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|date=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patent deals with fabrication of integrated circuits on a semiconductor wafer. The urban myth website [[snopes.com]] suggests that there is no evidence that the four inventors listed on the patent application were on the aircraft passenger list, nor that they were entitled to a 20% share of the patent, and it says it is unlikely that their share would revert to Freescale on their death as presented in the email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patent Pending|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/conspiracy/malaysiapatent.asp|website=Snopes.com|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retired [[Delta Air Lines]] Captain Field McConnell claimed that the aircraft was seized to obtain [[stealth technology|stealth knowledge]] of classified patents from 22 Chinese employees of Austin-based [[Freescale Semiconductor|Freescale]]. McConnell also claimed that the company has developed a classified technology that uses paint and electronics to enable traditional aircraft to be overhauled into stealthy jets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Analyst: Stealth Technology Seizure Behind MH370 Disappearance|url=http://voiceofrussia.com/us/2014_03_18/Stealth-Technology-Seizure-Behind-MH370-Disappearance-5715/|publisher=Voice of Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diego Garcia===
Conspiracy theorists have suggested that MH370 was either captured by the United States and then flown to the United States' military base on the atoll of [[Diego Garcia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26609687 |title=Missing Malaysia plane: 10 theories examined |publisher=BBC News |date=19 March 2014|accessdate=26 March 2014|author=De Castella, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[British Indian Ocean Territory|B.I.O.T.]] or that the plane landed at the base directly.

In that vein, it was reported by the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', without giving a concrete source, that the captain had trained in landing on an Indian Ocean island with a short runway, using a flight simulator in his home computer.&lt;ref name="mirror.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/flight-mh370-official-police-investigation-3741513 Flight MH370: Missing jet pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah is prime suspect because he cleared his diary] (''Daily Mirror'', 23 June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Several mass media sources reported that the captain had trained using his aviasimulator to land on five runways (at least 1,000 meters long) in the Indian Ocean region, namely Diego Garcia and Male International Airport (MLE) and other airstrips in India and Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=CNN-DG&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1114188|title=FLIGHT MH370 FACTS|date=2014-03-29|publisher=MEDIAVIEWS CNN iReport|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/cops-find-five-indian-ocean-practice-runways-in-mh370-pilots-simulator-bh-r|title=Cops find five Indian Ocean practice runways in MH370 pilot's simulator, BH reports |date=2014-03-18|publisher=malaymail Online|access-date=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published on March 18, 2014, journalists Farah Ahmed and Ahmed Naif of the [[Maldives|Maldivian]] Newspaper Haveeru wrote: "...several residents of [[Kudahuvadhoo|Kuda Huvadhoo]] told Haveeru on Tuesday that they saw a 'low flying jumbo jet' at around 06:15 on March 8. They said that it was a white aircraft, with red stripes across it – which is what the Malaysia Airlines flights typically look like. Eyewitnesses from the Kuda Huvadhoo concurred that the jet was travelling North to South-East, towards the Southern tip of the Maldives – Addu. They also noted the incredibly loud noise that the flight made when it flew over the island. 'I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly.' said an eyewitness. 'It's not just me either, several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing. Some people got out of their houses to see what was causing the tremendous noise too.' Mohamed Zaheem, the Island Councilor of Kuda Huvadhoo, said that the residents of the island had spoken about the incident."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/54062 |title=Maldives island residents report sighting of 'low flying jet' |work=HaveeruOnline |date=18 March 2014 |accessdate=8 March 2015 |author1=Ahmed, Farah |author2=Naif, Ahmed |lastauthoramp=yes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309021246/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/54062 |archivedate=9 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambodia===
In 2018, Ian Wilson, a British video producer, claimed to have spotted the aircraft's remains in [[Cambodia]], using images from [[Google Maps]] which were dated to 2018. The images show what appears to be a plane about {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} (ca 10% larger than the MH370's official measurement of {{convert|63.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}). In addition, the Cambodian jungle is roughly near where [[air traffic controller]]s lost contact with the aircraft, on the route from Kuala Lumpur to China.&lt;ref name="Mirror2018"&gt;{{cite news |last=Jolly |first=Bradley |title=Google Maps tech expert claims he's found doomed flight MH370 in 'darkest part of Cambodian jungle' |publisher=The [[Daily Mirror|Mirror]] |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/google-maps-tech-expert-claims-13184611 |date=2018-09-04 |access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyStar2018"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rivers |first=David |title=MH370 found in Cambodian JUNGLE?

===Phantom cellphone hypothesis===
Some have speculated that the passengers are still alive but cannot answer their cellphones—sometimes known as the "phantom cellphone theory". This was based on early reports that family members of Flight 370 passengers heard ringing (as opposed to a busy/off signal) while calling the passengers' phones, though this was after the plane disappeared.&lt;ref name=Pickell&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boston.com/news/source/2014/03/9_crazy_conspiracy_theories_about_malaysian_airlines_flight.html | title=9 crazy conspiracy theories about Malaysia Airlines flight 370 | work=Boston.com| date=12 March 2014| accessdate=24 March 2014| author=Pickell, Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, has been challenged by Jeff Kagan, a wireless analyst, who in an email to [[NBC News]] explained that the network may still produce "[[Ringback tone|ringbacks]]" as it searches for a connection, even if the cellphone has been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/missing-jet/malaysia-airlines-passengers-phones-ringing-maybe-not-n49371 | title=Malaysia Airlines Passengers' Phones Ringing?

A book, ''Goodnight Malaysian 370'', was published in August 2014 by New Zealanders Geoff Taylor and Ewan Wilson; the authors blamed a deliberate act of the pilot for the aircraft's disappearance, but admitted they were not able to "provide any conclusive evidence to support his theory" nor any motive.

Boeing 777 captain Simon Hardy told [[BBC News Online|BBC News]] that the plane's route was "probably very accurate flying rather than just a coincidence", and noted that the aircraft's turn toward the north-west over the Malacca Strait allowed a clear view of the captain's home island of [[Penang]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Westcott|first1=Richard|title=Flight MH370: Could it have been suicide?|url=http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-31736835|accessdate=8 March 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, the Boeing pilot Simon Hardy, who had made similar claims already in 2015, claimed in [[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes Australia]] that the captain used the flight as a murder-suicide and had deliberately flown the plane over his hometown of Penang before turning right and ditching the plane over the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Palin|first1=Megan |title=Chilling MH370 discovery about how pilot flew undetected, according to aviation experts|accessdate=14 May 2018|publisher=news.com.au|via=''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''|date=14 May 2018|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=12050868}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said they found these results by reconstructing the captain's flight plan from the military radar and that the captain had avoided detection of the plane by  military radar by flying along the border of Malaysia and Thailand, crossing in and out of each country's airspaces.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/mh370-malaysia-airlines-captain-deliberate-plane-crash-murder-suicide-zaharie-amad-shah-a8350621.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire==
A number of theories suggest that the disappearance may have been the result of a cockpit, cargo compartment, landing gear, or other onboard fire. 
 
In an earlier incident involving a Boeing 777, on 29 July 2011, [[EgyptAir Flight 667]] suffered an intense oxygen-fed cockpit fire while still on the ground which destroyed the flight controls and instruments and burnt a hole through the skin of the aircraft. Despite the arrival of firefighters within three minutes, the fire took 90 minutes to extinguish.&lt;ref name=Reilly2014&gt;{{cite news|last=Reilly|first=Jill|title=Is this proof that flight MH370 was downed by a 'blow torch' fire in its cockpit?

Another suggestion is that the pilots had turned back and were attempting an emergency landing at the nearest suitable airport in [[Northern Malaya|Northern Malaysia]], perhaps [[Penang International Airport]] or [[Langkawi International Airport]] (Langkawi Island), a 13,000-foot airstrip with an approach over water with no obstacles. The emergency may have been due to an incident similar to the 11 July 1991 accident involving a Douglas DC-8, [[Nigeria Airways Flight 2120]], where a tire caught fire on takeoff, and the later spreading of the fire led to the destruction of the aircraft with the loss of 261 lives.&lt;ref name=Goodfellow2014&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodfellow|first=Chris|title=A Startlingly Simple Theory About the Missing Malaysia Airlines Jet|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/03/mh370-electrical-fire/|accessdate=24 April 2014|newspaper=Wired|date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another accident, involving a fire on a [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] on 2 September 1998, [[Swissair Flight 111]] from New York to Geneva developed a cockpit fire in the electrical wiring that spread rapidly, leading to a loss of flight instruments and control. The aircraft crashed into the Atlantic Ocean with the loss of 229 lives, 8 kilometres (5.0&amp;nbsp;mi) from shore, southwest of [[Halifax Stanfield International Airport|Halifax International Airport]], Nova Scotia, where the plane was attempting an emergency landing. In the Swissair case the transponders and communications were shut off as the crew pulled the busses in an attempt to control the fire.

American political commentator [[Rush Limbaugh]], according to [[CNN]], speculated that the aircraft may have been shot down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/21/world/asia/missing-plane-mystery-clues-theories/index.html |title=Flight 370: When facts are few, imaginations run wild |publisher=CNN |date=22 March 2014 |accessdate=24 March 2014 |author=O'Neill, Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of this theory have noted that [[List of airliner shootdown incidents|civilian aircraft have been shot down by military forces in the past]], with [[Iran Air Flight 655]] by the United States in 1988 and [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007|KAL 007]] by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1983 being two frequently cited examples.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web |title=Theories Take Flight Over Disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Jet |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/theories-flight-disappearance-malaysia-airlines-jet/story?id=22898735 |author=Colleen Curry |date=13 March 2014 |publisher=ABC News Internet Ventures |accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19&amp;nbsp;March 2014, [[news agency]] reporter Scott Mayerowitz of [[Associated Press]] described "Accidental Shootdown" as one of seven "leading, plausible theories", but added that there was "no evidence that Flight&amp;nbsp;370 was brought down by a government entity".&lt;ref name=AP-Mayerowitz-Lowy01a&gt;{{cite web |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-leading-theories-disappearance-flight-370-214822401--finance.html |title=7 leading theories on disappearance of Flight 370 |last=Mayerowitz |first=Scott |website=Yahoo News |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=25 January 2015 |date=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Malaysian defence official, Ackbal bin Haji Abdul Samad, said it was "highly not possible" that his country's air force had shot down the plane.&lt;ref name=FinExpress01a/&gt; According to ''[[The Financial Express (India)|The Financial Express]]'', the [[Malaysian Air Force]] detected the plane on radar while it was in flight, but took no action because it was believed to be a "friendly" aircraft.&lt;ref name=FinExpress01a&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/missing-malaysian-airlines-plane-not-shot-down-defence-official/1234863 |title=Missing Malaysian Airlines MH370 plane not shot down, avers Defence official |work=The Financial Express |date=22 March 2014 |accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May&amp;nbsp;2014, author [[Nigel Cawthorne]]'s book ''[[Flight MH370: The Mystery]]'' was published. Cawthorne alleged that after the jet was shot down during a U.S.-Thai [[Joint Strike Fighter]] jet training exercise, searchers intentionally were sent astray as part of a sophisticated cover-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/23639246/mh370-may-have-been-shot-down-by-mistake-during-military-operation/ |title=Cover up |website=YahooNews |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519065213/https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/23639246/mh370-may-have-been-shot-down-by-mistake-during-military-operation/ |archive-date=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book received considerable criticism, especially from ''[[The Australian]]'' where it was characterised thus: "Cawthorne undoes everybody's good work by retrieving every obsolete and discredited non-fact from the trash, slapping the whole lot between covers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/flying-low-cashing-in-on-mh370/story-fn9n8gph-1226960235823 |title=Flying low, cashing in on MH370 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |first=David |last=Free |date=21 June 2014 |access-date=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatives of those aboard Flight 370 criticised the book as "premature and insensitive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/11078770/MH370-Six-reasons-why-plane-vanished.html |title=MH370: Six 'reasons' why plane vanished |work=The Telegraph |date=8 September 2014 |accessdate=19 January 2015 |last=Phillips |first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a CNN interview on 24&amp;nbsp;April 2014, the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Malaysian Prime Minister]], [[Najib Razak]], stated only that the radar "tracked an aircraft which did a turn back, but they were not exactly sure whether it was MH370. What they were sure of was that the aircraft was not deemed to be hostile."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/10786456/Malaysian-prime-minister-refuses-to-declare-MH370-lost.html |title=Malaysian prime minister refuses to declare MH370 lost |newspaper=The Telegraph |first=David |last=Millward |date=24 April 2014 |access-date=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22&amp;nbsp;December 2014 the former head of [[Proteus Airlines]], [[Marc Dugain]], claimed that the plane may have been shot down by U.S. military personnel out of fear of an attack similar to the [[September 11 attacks]] on their Navy Base in [[Diego Garcia]].&lt;ref name=AU&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/former-proteus-airlines-boss-marc-dugain-claims-mh370-may-have-been-shot-down-by-us-military-near-diego-garcia/story-fnizu68q-1227164555636 |title=Former Proteus Airlines boss Marc Dugain claims MH370 may have been shot down by US military near Diego Garcia |publisher=News.com.au |date=22 December 2014 |accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claims were described by the source article as "wild".&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;

Incidentally, later that same year [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|a different Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777]] was shot down over Ukraine by a surface-to-air missile.

==Cyberattack==
The hypothesis that a [[cyberattack]] may have been carried out on Flight 370 has been raised, primarily based on statements made by Sally Leivesley, a former scientific advisor to the UK government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ibtimes.com/new-malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370-cyber-hijack-theory-emerges-after-vulnerabilities-1561723?ft=74gk7 | title=New Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 'Cyber Hijack' Theory Emerges After 'Vulnerabilities' Found In Inflight System| publisher=[[International Business Times]] | date=16 March 2014 | first1=Philip | last1=Ross | accessdate=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leivesley proposed that hackers may have changed the plane's speed, direction, and altitude using radio signals to the plane's [[flight management system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/465126/Missing-Malaysia-Airlines-plane-may-have-been-cyber-hijacked-using-mobile-phone | title=World's first cyber hijack: Was missing Malaysia Airlines flight hacked with mobile phone? | work=[[Daily Express]] | date=16 March 2014| accessdate=5 April 2014|author1=Fielding, James |author2=Winter, Stuart }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether existing security on commercial flights is sufficient to prevent such an attack is also a matter of debate, although [[Boeing]] has dismissed the possibility. A spokeswoman for the company, Gayla Keller, said that they were "confident in the robust protection of all flight critical systems and inability for a hacker to gain access by either external or internal means on the 777 and all Boeing airplanes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wtop.com/215/3589889/Boeing-rules-out-777-cyber-sabotage | title=Boeing rules out cyber sabotage connection to missing plane | work=[[WTOP-FM]] | date=25 March 2014| accessdate=30 March 2014| author=Green, J.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While supporters of this theory have cited Hugo Teso's app which hacked into pilot-training software, which Teso presented at a conference in April 2013, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] and other major governmental bodies dismissed the significance of the app. They stated that the software on an actual plane would be different from the software on which Teso had tested his app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/Cyber-Conflict-Monitor/2014/0324/Malaysia-Airlines-Flight-MH370-Are-planes-vulnerable-to-cyber-attack-video | title=Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370: Are planes vulnerable to cyber-attack?

== Vertical entry into the sea ==
A mathematics professor from Texas has argued that the plane must have entered the sea vertically; any other angle of entry would have splintered the airplane to many pieces, which would have necessarily been found already.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.tamu.edu/~goong.chen/mh370.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/21/us/malaysia-airlines-flight-370-theories/|title=MH370 possibly plunged straight into ocean, expert says|author=Michael Martinez|author2= Don Melvin|date=July 30, 2015|website=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MH17 and QZ8501 connections==
On 17 July 2014, [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] was shot down over Ukraine. Because it, like Flight 370, was also a Boeing 777, some conspiracy theorists have suggested that the plane that crashed in Ukraine was actually Flight 370. This is based in part on photographs of the crash scene, which conspiracy theorists claim show that the plane that crashed in Ukraine had structural differences from MH17. Experts have dismissed this theory and argued that it is merely coincidental that both planes involved belonged to the same airline.&lt;ref name="BBC persistence of conspiracy theories"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29083905 | title=Malaysia Airlines MH370: The persistence of conspiracy theories | work=BBC News | date=8 September 2014 | accessdate=8 September 2014 | author=De Castella, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopefully this comment will help lead to speedier reverting of any future such removals. --&gt;Another hypothesis is that a [[meteor]] might have struck the plane; however, the statistical probability for this is extremely low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/21/us/malaysia-airlines-flight-370-theories/ | title=From 'ghostly' to psychic, theories abound on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 | work=CNN | date=21 March 2014| accessdate=24 March 2014| author=Martinez, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claims of responsibility ==

On 9 March 2014, members of the Chinese news media received an open letter that claimed to be from the leader of the Chinese Martyrs Brigade, a previously unknown group. The letter claimed that the loss of Flight 370 was in retaliation for the Chinese government's response to the [[2014 Kunming attack|knife attacks at Kunming railway station on 1 March 2014]] and part of the wider separatist campaign against Chinese control over [[Xinjiang]] province. The letter also listed unspecified grievances against the Malaysian government. The letter's claim was dismissed as fraudulent based on its lack of detail regarding the fate of Flight 370 and the fact that the name "Chinese Martyrs Brigade" appeared inconsistent with [[East Turkestan independence movement|Uyghur separatist groups]] which describe themselves as "East Turkestan" and "Islamic" rather than "Chinese".&lt;ref name=20140309boxuncmb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxun.com/news/gb/intl/2014/03/201403091656.shtml |title="中国烈士旅领导人"发信称对马航客机失事负责 |date=9 March 2014 |accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20140310ibtimescmb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/obscure-group-northwestern-china-chinese-martyrs-brigade-claims-responsibility-missing-malaysia |title=Obscure Group From Northwestern China, Chinese Martyrs' Brigade, Claims Responsibility For Missing Malaysia Airline Flight MH370; Authorities Skeptical of Claim |date=10 March 2014 |accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1982 non-fiction ''Tortious Liability for Unintentional Harm in the Common Law and the Civil Law,'' the author discusses problems associated with liability in European Law. He uses the term ''mortal wound'' to discuss the issue of accountability regarding ''mortally wounding'' a slave. The author states "In the first, Celsus, Marcellus and Ulpian agree that if one man gives a slave a moral wound and another afterwards kills him, only the latter is liable under the first chapter for killing the former only under the third for wounding," while contrastingly he also explains "Julian… says... if one man gives a slave a mortal wound and after an interval another strikes him in a way as to hasten his death, both are liable for killing." The author explains that the juxtaposition is due to Julian focusing on the original wound being intentionally mortal, leading to the slaves death, while Celsus contradicts Julian and mainly focuses on the importance of the resulting death of the slave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/?id=huc7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q=mortal%20wound&amp;f=false|title=Tortious Liability for Unintentional Harm in the Common Law and the Civil Law: Volume 1, Text|last=Lawson|first=F.

More modern usage of the term ''mortal wound'' is often more figurative than literal: seen in the 1998 article ''Paternal Style Leaves Mortal Wounds'' by Deutsch Stephen. The article talks about the demise of a hospital without a director present and a proper mission statement which would lead to it's implied 'eventual' death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=S.

=== Usage in law ===
''The Law Dictionary (2013)'' defines the term mortal wound as "the term that is applied to a wound that is fatal"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thelawdictionary.org/mortal-wound/|title=What is MORTAL WOUND? definition of MORTAL WOUND (Black's Law Dictionary)|date=2013-03-28|work=The Law Dictionary|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2007 ''Republic of Philippines Supreme Court Petition for Review'' of Lazaro (petitioner) versus Crisaldo Alberto (prosecutor) the decision report uses the term "mortal wound", it discusses the importance of being able to discern whether the petitioner had inflicted a mortal or non-mortal wound on the prosecutor Crisaldo in determining the sentence for Lazaro. If the Jury believed that Crisaldo had been inflicted with a mortal wound, which would have lead to death if untreated, then Lazaro would be accused of attempted murder, rather than frustrated murder. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2007/june2007/157057.htm|title=Lazaro v. Alberto, Petition for Review 2007|last=|first=|date=|website=Republic of Philippines, Supreme Court|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Causation in Criminal Law'' from the Pennsylvania Law Review the term "moral wound" is used to denote that an injury is serious.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Midson|first=Brenda|date=2010|title=Teaching Causation in Criminal Law: Learning to Think Like Policy Analysts|url=http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/LegEdRev/2010/7.html|journal=Legal Education Review|volume=20(1&amp;2)|pages=109|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Causation in the Law'' from Oxford University Press, the term "mortal wound" is given three meanings: (i) an injury that is likely to cause death to an average person under normal circumstances (ii) an injury that has a high likelihood of causing the victim death if left untreated medically; (iii) an injury that is likely to cause death even though it does not apply to the first two circumstances (e.g. a minor injury neglected by the victim).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Usage in the media ===
The 2018 Australian news article ''Dutton delivers mortal wound to Turnbull'' uses "mortal wound" metaphorically as the death of Prime minister Turnbull's party's support. Member of parliament Petter Dutton challenged Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull for leadership of the Australian Liberal Party. The article describes it as, when fewer than 60% of a prime minister's colleagues support him he is a "dead leader walking."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/australia/dutton-delivers-mortal-wound-to-turnbull/ar-BBMc0hp|title=Dutton delivers mortal wound to Turnbull|website=www.msn.com|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Being Frightened is not a Mortal Wound'' is a 2017 article written by the Times Columnist as a response to a letter on the 2nd November, ''Let’s rethink Halloween Fireworks.'' The letter describes its dissatisfaction that people believe that taking offence is synonymous with being ''mortally wounded''. They use this stance to argue that people are being overly cautious by trying to alter the halloween fireworks due to the possibility of frightening animals and children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Theresa May Tallinn Digital (Crop).jpg|thumb|Party leader and Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] in late 2017]]
The '''next Conservative Party leadership election''' has not yet been formally launched. Speculation of a leadership election centres around the [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Theresa May]]'s fate. It first arose following the party's poor showing at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 snap general election]] that May had called in hope of increasing her parliamentary majority for Brexit negotiations. However, the Conservatives lost their majority in the House of Commons due to a swing towards the Labour Party.

Subsequent speculation has arisen from the difficulties May has had in agreeing a [[Brexit]] deal that is acceptable to the Conservative Party. These escalated in November 2018, with members of the [[Eurosceptic]] [[European Research Group]] pushing for a vote of no confidence in May. Were this to occur and May to lose, a new leadership election would be called.

==Background==
After [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Britain voted to leave the EU]], [[David Cameron]] resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and as Prime Minister, which triggered the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2016|2016 Conservative Party leadership election]]. Home Secretary Theresa May won the contest after the withdrawal of [[Andrea Leadsom]], and succeeded Cameron as Prime Minister on 13 July. As Prime Minister, May began the process of [[Brexit|withdrawing the UK from the European Union]], triggering [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 50]] on 29 March 2017. In April 2017, May announced a snap [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|general election in June]], in order to "strengthen her hand" when she negotiated with the European Union. Opinion polls originally predicted a landslide victory for the Conservative Party, and May aimed to substantially increase her party's slim majority. However, the result was a hung parliament, in which the number of Conservative seats fell from 330 to 317, prompting her to broker a [[confidence and supply]] [[Conservative–DUP agreement|deal]] with Northern Ireland's [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) to support her minority government.

May's handling of the campaign was widely criticised, particularly the role of her two chiefs of staff, [[Nick Timothy]] and [[Fiona Hill]]. In June 2017, former Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[George Osborne]], described May as a "dead woman walking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40237819|title=General election 2017: Theresa May is 'best placed person' for Brexit|date=11 June 2017|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey on the website [[Conservative Home]] found that almost two-thirds of Conservative party members wanted Theresa May to resign.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/10/almost-two-thirds-conservative-party-members-want-theresa-may/|title=

Former Cabinet minister [[Nicky Morgan]] said that May could not lead the Conservative Party into the next general election and called for a leadership election in the summer or in 2018 before the Brexit deal is finalised. Brexiteers pledged loyalty to May but many reportedly threatened an immediate leadership challenge should May plan to dilute her initial plans for Brexit. After the [[Grenfell Tower fire]], May's leadership faced more criticism after her initial refusal to meet victims and her poor handling of the crisis.

With May's position weakened, senior colleagues in the party were said to be preparing for a leadership contest and "jostling for succession".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amp.ft.com/content/02f15952-6099-11e7-8814-0ac7eb84e5f1|title=Theresa May braced for a fall as Brexit tests loom|website=amp.ft.com|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians and journalists do not expect May to lead the party at the next general election, with the Sunday Times Political Editor [[Tim Shipman]] describing "the first shots in a battle that could tear the government apart" in a July 2017 article as the three then-leading contenders for the leadership, [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], [[Boris Johnson]] and [[Philip Hammond]], briefed against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mr-grey-mr-blond-and-mr-brexit-battle-of-the-big-guns-sj0zs2pzz|title=Mr Grey, Mr Blond and Mr Brexit: battle of the big guns|first=Tim Shipman, Political|last=Editor|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Junior ministers were also said to be frustrated at Cabinet ministers propping up a Prime Minister with no authority to further their careers, with some ministers preparing to resign in order to trigger a leadership election. [[Andrew Mitchell]], an ally of Davis, was said to have told a dinner that May was finished and was said to be organising letters to force May to announce her date of departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/09/theresa-may-pressure-to-quit-former-ministers-andrew-mitchell-grant-shapps|title=May attempts to reassert grip over Tory party amid talk of challenge|first=Rowena Mason Deputy political|last=editor|date=9 July 2017|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A July 2017 report in The Independent said a core of fifteen Conservative MPs were ready to sign a letter of no confidence, with forty-eight needed to trigger a contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-no-confidence-letter-tory-conservative-mps-jeremy-corbyn-a7855451.html|title=15 Tory MPs 'sign no confidence letter in Theresa May'|date=23 July 2017|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

May reportedly announced to Conservative MPs in August 2017 that she would resign as Prime Minister on 30 August 2019, making it likely that the next leadership election would take place in the summer of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/08/27/theresa-may-is-apparently-going-to-resign-in-2019-6881925/|title=Theresa May is apparently 'going to resign in 2019'|first=Adam|last=Smith|date=27 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, May subsequently announced on 31 August 2017 that she intended to stay on to fight the next general election, which under the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] is scheduled to be in 2022 (though it can be held earlier if MPs vote for it to be, as happened for the snap election of 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/182055d0-8d80-11e7-a352-e46f43c5825d|title=Theresa May vows to fight next UK election as prime minister|date=31 August 2017|accessdate=31 August 2017|newspaper=Financial Times|first=Robert|last=Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September 2017, Johnson published an article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' laying out his vision for Brexit. Many people saw this as him positioning himself for a leadership challenge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yougov.co.uk/opi/surveys/results#/survey/f239f61c-9c54-11e7-8370-e14fde485354/question/60e9d673-9c55-11e7-9df1-dfcb2e853687/toplines|title=YouGov - What the world thinks|website=yougov.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-cabinet-boris-johnson-brexit-manifesto-conservatives-tory-leader-prime-minister-a7953866.html|title=Theresa May just responded to Boris Johnson's '£350m claim' for the NHS|date=18 September 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some commentators, such as ''[[Newsnight]]'''s political editor [[Nick Watt]] and columnist [[Iain Dale]], argued this was the wrong interpretation and that Johnson's motivation was to assert his influence in Brexit negotiations. The timing of the article, a few days before May was to give a significant speech on her plans for the UK's relationship with Europe after Brexit, and shortly after a terrorist attack in London, was criticised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41307263|title=May 'driving from the front' on Brexit|date=18 September 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Newsnight'', BBC2, 18 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018===
Following Cabinet agreement for May's proposals on Brexit, Davis resigned from his government position on 8 July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rayner |first1=Gordon |title=David Davis resigns as Brexit secretary |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/07/08/david-davis-resigns-brexit-secretary/ |accessdate=8 July 2018 |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="resignation"&gt;{{cite news |title=Brexit Secretary David Davis resigns |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44761056 |work=BBC News |date=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following that, [[Steve Baker (politician)|Steve Baker]] also resigned. On the same day it was reported that May was facing the threat of a leadership contest amid mounting anger from Brexiteers over her government's Brexit policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-theresa-may-leadership-challenge-plan-tories-mps-chequers-jacob-rees-mogg-a8437706.html|title=Theresa May faces leadership challenge threat from Tory Brexiteers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative Party backbencher [[Andrea Jenkyns]] called on for the Prime Minister to be replaced, saying “Theresa May's premiership is over”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/07/top-uk-brexit-officials-resign-in-blow-to-theresa-may.html|title=Top Brexit Officials Resign in Blow to Theresa May|first=Margaret|last=Hartmann|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/brexit/2018/0709/977344-brexit-british-government/|title=May to fight any leadership challenge|date=9 July 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson later resigned as Foreign Secretary on 9 July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/09/boris-johnson-resigns-as-foreign-secretary-brexit|title=Boris Johnson resigns as foreign secretary over May's Brexit plans|last=|first=|date=|website=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Daily Telegraph'' article opposing the [[burqa ban]] in Denmark by Johnson in early August 2018 sparked controversy given some of the language he used, saying women wearing the burqa look like letter boxes or bank robbers. Some saw it as an attempt to court an anti-Islamic segment of the Conservative Party membership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/world/europe/boris-johnson-trump-burqa.html|title=Boris Johnson, a ‘Burqa Storm’ and Perhaps Some Populist Calculations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the electorate in a leadership campaign, while others defended him as straight-talking. [[Dominic Grieve]] MP said on 8 August that he would not remain in the party if Johnson became leader.&lt;ref&gt;''Newsnight'', BBC2, 8 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, May presented her final proposal for an initial Brexit deal following negotiations with the EU. [[Dominic Raab]], her Brexit secretary, and others resigned from the Cabinet in response,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46219495|title=Raab quits over 'flawed' Brexit agreement|date=15 November 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]] calling for a leadership election for the first time. Members of the [[Eurosceptic]] [[European Research Group]], like Rees-Mogg and [[Steve Baker (politician)|Steve Baker]], were seen to be launching a coup in mid-November following the Cabinet resignations. There was considerable speculation over whether enough letters of no confidence would be reached to trigger a vote.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''Newsnight'', BBC2, 15 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

15% of the Parliamentary party (currently 48 MPs) need to send a letter to the chairman of the [[1922 Committee]] to trigger a no confidence vote in the Conservative Party leader. As of early afternoon on 16 November 2018, the BBC reported there were 21 MPs who had publicly stated they had sent a letter: Rees-Mogg, Baker, [[Andrea Jenkyns]], [[Andrew Bridgen]], [[Philip Davies]], [[James Duddridge]], [[Anne Marie Morris]], [[Lawrence Robertson]], [[Nadine Dorries]], [[Simon Clarke (politician)|Simon Clarke]], [[Henry Smith (British politician)|Henry Smith]], [[Maria Caulfield]], [[Sheryll Murray]], [[Lee Rowley]], [[Martin Vickers]], [[Peter Bone]], [[Mark Francois]], [[Adam Holloway]], [[John Whittingdale]], [[Ben Bradley (politician)|Ben Bradley]], [[Chris Green (politician)|Chris Green]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46237174|title=Who has written no confidence letters?|date=17 November 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker asserted that more letters had been sent and that he expected 48 to be reached probably in the week beginning 19 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-46200010|title=May bids to shore up support for Brexit deal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, commentators expressed some scepticism about this prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/brexit-plotters-give-us-a-lesson-on-how-not-to-do-a-coup|title=Brexit plotters give us a lesson on how not to do a coup|date=16 November 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 19 November, 26 MPs publicly said they had submitted letters, with the addition of [[Marcus Fysh]], [[Zac Goldsmith]], [[David Jones (Clwyd West MP)|David Jones]], [[Bill Cash]], and [[Philip Hollobone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46237174|title=Who has written no confidence letters?|date=19 November 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker also suggested that the ERG could draw lots for who would be their candidate in a leadership election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/16/may-the-force-be-with-her-theresa-pm-digs-in-with-her-brexit-deal|title=May the force be with her?

The '''Paris massacre of 1961''' occurred on 17 October 1961, during the [[Algerian War]] (1954–62). Under orders from the [[Prefecture of Police|head of the Parisian police]], [[Maurice Papon]], the [[French National Police]] attacked a [[demonstration (people)|demonstration]] of some 30,000 pro-[[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) Algerians.&lt;!-- Two months before, the FLN had increased its bombing in France and to resumed the campaign against both [[Harki|pro-France Algerians]] and the rival [[Algerian nationalist]] organization, the [[Algerian National Movement]] in France.--&gt; After 37 years of denial and [[censorship]] of the press, in 1998 the French government finally acknowledged 40 deaths, although there are estimates of 100 to 300 victims.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenburg, Ted. 2002. "Islamic Hip-Hop versus Islamophobia" in Mitchell, Tony (ed) ''Global Noise''. p.77&lt;/ref&gt; Death was due to [[Police brutality|heavy-handed beating by the police]], as well as massive drownings, as police officers threw demonstrators in the river [[Seine]].

The massacre appears to have been intentional, as has been demonstrated by historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Luc Einaudi|fr}}, who won a trial against Maurice Papon in 1999. (Papon had been convicted in 1998 on charges of [[crimes against humanity]] for his role under the [[Vichy France|Vichy collaborationist regime]] during [[World War II]].) Official documentation and accounts of eyewitnesses within the Paris police department suggest that the 1961 massacre was directed by Papon himself. Police records show that Papon called for officers in one station to be "subversive" in quelling the demonstrations, and assured them protection from prosecution if they participated.&lt;ref name="Bataille"&gt;{{fr icon}} Jean-Luc Einaudi: "La bataille de Paris: 17 octobre 1961", 1991, {{ISBN|2-02-013547-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forty years after the massacre, on 17 October 2001, [[Bertrand Delanoë]], the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist]] [[Paris mayors|Mayor of Paris]], put up a plaque in remembrance of the massacre on the [[Pont Saint-Michel]].&lt;ref name="LDH"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Le 17 octobre 1961, la réalité d'un massacre face à un mensonge d'Etat (17 October 1961, the reality of a massacre against a state lie) |date=16 October 2001 | accessdate = 7 May 2006 | publisher=[[Le Monde]] | url=http://www.ldh-toulon.net/article.php3?id_article=124|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1604970.stm BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt; How many demonstrators were killed is still unclear.

== Background ==
{{Further|Algerian War}}
{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}
On 17 October 1961, the massacre took place in the context of the Algerian War (1954–62), which had become increasingly violent over the years. After [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]]'s equivocal return to power during the [[May 1958 crisis]] and his sudden change of policy concerning Algerian independence, the [[Organisation de l'armée secrète|OAS]] used all possible means to oppose the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN), which took the war to the [[metropolis]] where it was helped by some activists such as the [[Jeanson network]]. The [[Torture during the Algerian War|repression by French authorities]], both in Algeria and in [[metropolitan France]], was very harsh.

[[File:Maurice Papon 1.JPG|thumb|[[Maurice Papon]], who died in 2007, was the only [[Vichy France]] official to be convicted for his role in the deportation of Jews during World War Two]]
According to historian Jean-Luc Einaudi, a specialist on the massacre, some of the causes of the violent repression of the 17 October 1961 demonstration can best be understood in terms of the composition of the French police force itself, which still included many former members of the force in place during the World War II [[Vichy regime]] which had collaborated with the [[Gestapo]] to detain [[Jews]], as for example in the [[Vel' d'Hiv Roundup]] of 16–17 July 1942.

The vast majority of police officers suspended after the [[Liberation of Paris]] in 1944 for extreme forms of collaborationism (including assistance to the ''[[Parti Populaire Français]]'' and similar groups) were later reintegrated into the police forces. In contrast, some of the policemen who had been part of the [[French Resistance|Resistance movement]] had their career advancement blocked because of [[Cold War]] [[anti-communism]], since the Resistance was partially [[French Communist Party|communist]] and communist ministers had been expelled from the government in May 1947. Moreover, police officers who had been members of the Resistance might well have taken part in the various raids against Jews and other persecuted groups during the Vichy regime, as otherwise they would have been dismissed, according to Einaudi and [[Maurice Rajsfus]].

The career of Maurice Papon as [[Préfecture de Paris|Head of Paris' police force]] in the 1960s and Minister of Finance under [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]]'s presidency in the 1970s, suggests that there was [[institutional racism]] in the French police until at least the 1960s. In fact, Papon was not charged and convicted until 1997–98 for his World War II [[crimes against humanity]] in being responsible for the deportation of 1,560 Jews, including children and the elderly, between 1942 and 1944.

=== Papon appointed head of Police Prefecture (March 1958) ===
{{Further|Maurice Papon}}
Before his appointment as chief of the Paris police, Papon had been, since 1956, [[prefectures of France|prefect]] of the [[Constantine Province|Constantine department]] in Algeria, where he actively participated in the repression of and the [[Torture during the Algerian War|use of torture]] against the civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;

A la Seine! Mort aux fellaghas!" (''Dirty Jews! Into the Seine (river)! Death to the (Algerian) rebels!''). With the recommendation of Minister of Interior [[Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury]], Maurice Papon was next day named prefect of the police. Two years earlier, in [[Constantine, Algeria]], he had assumed the role of "Inspecteur général pour l'administration en mission extraordinaire" (IGAME – General Inspector for the Administration on Extraordinary Mission). "Prohibited zones, [[detention centers]] ('camps de regroupements'), torture, executions without trial: this is the reality of the war he [Papon] was supervising out there." According to Einaudi, in the following years he applied these methods in Paris and the [[Seine]] department.&lt;ref&gt;Einaudi, p.72&lt;/ref&gt;

After the May 1958 crisis and the installation of the new [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] under 'Free France' leader Charles de Gaulle's leadership, Maurice Papon was kept on. Papon created the 'compagnies de district' (district companies), police forces that specialized in repression, where new police recruits were trained. These district companies were formed mainly from veterans of the [[First Indochina War|Indochina War]] (1947–54) and young Frenchmen coming back from Algeria.

=== August 1958 raids ===
On 25 August 1958, an FLN offensive in Paris killed three policemen on [[boulevard]] de l'Hôpital in the [[13th arrondissement of Paris|13th Arrondissement]] and another in front of the ''cartoucherie de Vincennes''. The Prefect of police, Maurice Papon, organized in retaliation massive raids on Algerian people in Paris and its suburbs. More than 5,000 Algerians were detained in the former Beaujon hospital, in the Japy gymnasium ([[11th arrondissement of Paris|11th Arrondissement]]) and in the Vél'd'Hiv – the Japy gymnasium and the Vél'd'Hiv had been used as [[detention centers]] under the Vichy regime.&lt;ref name=EinaudiRajsfus&gt;See Jean-Luc Einaudi and Maurice Rajsfus, 2001, pp.73–74 for 25 August 1958 FLN offensive; the detention of 5,000 Algerians; ''L'Humanité'' quote and the "boasting about throwing Algerians in the Seine".&lt;/ref&gt; A former member of the [[Francs-tireurs#World War II|FTP resistance]], reporter Madeleine Rifaud then wrote in ''[[L'Humanité]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the past two days, a racist [[concentration camp]] has been opened in Paris. They have not even had the good sense to choose a site which would not remind French patriots who are currently celebrating the anniversary of the Liberation of Paris of what took place there.&lt;ref name=EinaudiRajsfus/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Creation of the CIV and the FPA militia (1959–1960) ===
According to Einaudi, "Already at this time, policemen [were] boasting about throwing Algerians in the Seine" river.&lt;ref name=EinaudiRajsfus/&gt; [[Vincennes]]' "identification center" (CIV – ''Centre d'identification de Vincennes'') was then created under the authority of the prefecture of police in January 1959. Algerians detained during police raids in the Paris region could be brought there for identity verifications but could also be put under [[house arrest]] by the police prefect. "These raids were frequently the occasion of violence," Einaudi stated.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Luc Einaudi and Maurice Rajsfus, 2001, p.74&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Auxiliary Police Force'' (FPA – ''Force de police auxiliaire'') was then created in 1959. This special constabulary force, put under the authority of the Algerian Affairs Coordination Center of the Prefecture of Police (''Centre de coordination des Affaires algériennes de la préfecture de police'') and supervised by the military, was under the control of Papon. Led by Captain Raymond Montaner and based at the Fort de Noisy, [[Romainville]], it was composed entirely of Algerian Muslims – recruited either in Algeria or in France. In autumn 1960, the FPA was composed of 600 members. It first operated in the 13th Arrondissement where it requisitioned café-hotels. Torture is rumoured to have been utilized most notably at 9, rue Harvey and 208, rue du Château des Rentiers. Forced disappearances took place. The FPA then extended its action to the [[18th arrondissement of Paris|18th Arrondissement]], where three hotels were requisitioned in rue de la Goutte-d'Or. The FPA was also active in the suburbs, from the summer of 1961, in particular in [[Nanterre]]'s [[Shanty town|bidonvilles]]. Some voices were opposed to these crimes denied by the police prefecture".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Luc Einaudi and Maurice Rajsfus, 2001, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; Christian magazine ''[[Témoignage Chrétien]]'' wrote: "It is not possible to stay mute when, in our Paris, men are resurrecting the methods of the Gestapo".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by J.-L. Einaudi, 2001, p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1961 ===
The FLN decided to resume bombings against the French police at the end of August 1961; from the end of August 1961 to the beginning of October 1961, 11 policemen were killed and 17 injured in Paris and its suburbs. "These bombings had the effect of spreading fear throughout the ranks of the Paris police, but also for increasing the desire for revenge and hate against the whole of the community. During the whole of September, the Algerian population was severely repressed. In practice, this massive repression was based on physical appearance", according to Einaudi.&lt;ref&gt;Einaudi, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; Daily raids against Algerians — frequently confusing any [[Magreb]] people (Moroccans or Tunisians), and even Spanish or Italian immigrants, with Algerians. – Algerians were arrested at work or in the streets and were thrown into the Seine with their hands tied in order to drown them, among the other methods used for this repression, as shown for example by a report published by the priest, Joseph Kerlan, from the [[Roman Catholic Territorial Prelature of Mission de France|Mission de France]].&lt;ref&gt;Report quoted by Einaudi, pp.76–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Einaudi, "It was in this climate that, on 2 October, during the funerals of a policeman killed by the FLN, the police prefect (Papon) proclaimed, in the prefecture's courtyard: "For one hit taken we shall give back ten!" This call was an encouragement to kill Algerians and was immediately understood as such. On the same day, visiting [[Montrouge]]'s police station, the prefect of police declared to the police officers present: "You also must be subversive in the war that sets you against others. You will be covered, I give you my word on that."&lt;ref&gt;Einaudi, p.79.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
On 5 October 1961, the Prefecture of Police announced in a press statement the introduction of a [[curfew]] from 8.30 p.m. to 5.30 a.m. in Paris and its suburbs for "Algerian Muslim workers", "French Muslims" and "French Muslims of Algeria" (all three terms used by Papon, although the approximately 150,000 Algerians living at the time in Paris were officially considered French and possessed a French [[identity card]]). The French Federation of the FLN thus called upon the whole of the Algerian population in Paris, men, women and children, to demonstrate against the curfew, widely regarded as a racist administrative measure, on 17 October 1961. According to historian Jean-Luc Einaudi, Papon had 7,000 policemen, 1,400 [[Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité|CRS]] and ''[[gendarmerie|gendarmes]] mobiles'' (riot police) to block this demonstration, to which the Prefecture of Police had not given its agreement (mandatory for legal demonstrations). The police forces thus blocked all access to the capital, metro stations, train stations, Paris' ''Portes'', etc. Of a population of about 150,000 Algerians living in Paris, 30,000–40,000 of them managed to join the demonstration however. Police raids were carried out all over the city. 11,000 persons were arrested, and transported by [[Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens|RATP]] bus to the [[Parc des Expositions]] and other internment centers used under Vichy.&lt;ref name="Bataille" /&gt; Those detained included not only Algerians, but also Moroccans and Tunisians immigrants, who were then sent to the various police stations, to the courtyard of the police prefecture, the [[Palais des Sports (Paris)|Palais des Sports]] of Porte de Versailles ([[15th arrondissement of Paris|15th Arrondissement]]), and the [[Stade Pierre de Coubertin (Paris)|Stade Pierre de Coubertin]], etc.

Despite these raids, 4,000 to 5,000 people succeeded in demonstrating peacefully on the [[Grands Boulevards]] from [[République (Paris Metro)|République]] to [[Palais Garnier|Opéra]], without incident. Blocked at Opéra by police forces, the demonstrators backtracked. Reaching the Rex cinema (the site as the present Le Rex Club on the "Grands Boulevards"), the police opened fire on the crowd and charged, leading to several deaths. On the [[Neuilly-sur-Seine|Neuilly]] bridge (separating Paris from the suburbs), the police detachments and FPA members also shot at the crowd, killing some. Algerians were thrown into and drowned in the Seine at points across the city and its suburbs, most notably at the [[Pont Saint-Michel]] in the center of Paris and near the Prefecture of Police, very close to [[Notre Dame de Paris]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the night, a massacre took place in the courtyard of the police headquarters, killing tens of victims. In the Palais des Sports, then in the "[[Palais des Expositions]] of Porte de Versailles", detained Algerians, many by now already injured, [became] systematic victims of a 'welcoming committee'. In these places, considerable violence took place and prisoners were tortured. Men would be dying there until the end of the week. Similar scenes took place in the Coubertin stadium... The raids, violence and drownings would be continued over the following days. For several weeks, unidentified corpses were discovered along the banks of the river. The result of the massacre may be estimated to at least 200 dead.&lt;ref&gt;Einaudi, pp.82–82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1961, the police prefecture spoke only of "2 persons shot dead".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title= 17 octobre 1961 : la longue liste de morts des archives de Paris |date=23 October 1997 | publisher=[[L'Humanité]] | url=https://www.humanite.fr/journal/1997-10-23/1997-10-23-790094|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following historian Jean-Luc Einaudi's testimony during the Papon trial in the late-1990s, left-wing police Minister [[Jean-Pierre Chevènement]] ordered the opening of parts of the archives. The resulting Mandelken Report, based on the investigation of these partial records, counted 32 dead. Einaudi then published an [[op-ed]] in ''Le Monde'' on 20 May 1998, contesting this official figure, criticizing both the methodology of the report and the consulted records. He called attention to the fact that many of the records had been destroyed. A report that Papon had prepared for Interior Minister [[Roger Frey]], the prime minister, and the head of government, Charles de Gaulle, was not included in the consulted records. In addition, the Mandelken report ignored the massacre that had taken place in the courtyard of the Police prefecture, and Papon's name itself appeared nowhere in the report. Einaudi concluded his op-ed stating that: "on the night of 17 October 1961 there had been a massacre perpetrated by the police forces acting on the orders of Maurice Papon." Papon subsequently filed a lawsuit in February 1999, a courtsuit against him, because of this sentence, alleging [[defamation]] of a [[public servant]].

In the meanwhile, the state acknowledged in 1998 the massacre and spoke of 40 dead.

Responding to Papon's request, the court gave an ambiguous judgement. It stated that Einaudi had "defamed" Papon, but that Einaudi had acted on "good faith", and praised the "seriousness and quality" of Einaudi's research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.port.ac.uk/special/france1815to2003/chapter8/interviews/filetodownload,35748,en.pdf Maurice Papon, Vichy and Algeria], dissertation by Stephanie Hare-Cuming, [[London School of Economics]]&lt;/ref&gt; Both Papon and Einaudi were thus vindicated by the court's judgement.

The French government commission in 1998 claimed only 48 people died. Historian Jean-Luc Einaudi (''La Bataille de Paris'', Paris: Seuil, 1991) asserted that as many as 200 Algerians had been killed. The historian Jean-Paul Brunet found satisfactory evidence for the murder of 31 Algerians, while suggesting that a number of up to 50 actual victims was credible.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Brunet, ''Police Contre FLN: Le drame d'octobre 1961'', Paris: Flammarion, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

This contradicts David Assouline, who in 1997 was granted limited access to consult part of the police documents (which were supposed to be classified until 2012) by [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] [[Catherine Trautmann]] (PS). He found a list of 70 persons killed, while the texts confirmed Einaudi's comments that the magistrates who had been called on by the victims' families to consider these incidents had systematically acquitted the policemen. According to ''Le Monde'' in 1997, which quoted the director of the [[:fr:Archives de Paris|Paris Archives]], the register listed 90 persons by the second half of October.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning David Assouline's access to ''part'' of the Paris' Archives and the ''Monde'' quoting the director, see {{Cite news | title= 17 octobre 1961 : la longue liste de morts des archives de Paris|date=23 October 1997|publisher=[[L'Humanité]] | url=https://www.humanite.fr/node/137622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 article in ''[[Esprit (magazine)|Esprit]]'', [[Paul Thibaud]] discussed the controversy between Jean-Luc Einaudi, who spoke of 200 killed on 17 October, and 325 killed by the police during the autumn of 1961, and Jean-Paul Brunet, who gave an estimate of only 50 (and 160 dead, possible homicide victims, who passed through the IML medico-legal institute during the four months between September and December 1961). Although criticizing Einaudi on some points, Thibaud also underlined that Brunet had consulted only police archives and took the registers of the IML medico-legal institute at face value. Based on other sources, Thibaud pointed out (as did Brunet) that administrative dissimulation about the dead had taken place, and that the IML could not be relied upon as sole source. Thibaud concluded that Einaudi's work made it possible to give an estimate of 300 Algerian victims of murder (whether by police or others) between 1 September and 31 December 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Thibaud, "17 Octobre 1961: un moment de notre histoire," in ''[[Esprit (magazine)|Esprit]]'', November 2001 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events surrounding the massacre and its death toll were largely unknown for decades. There was almost no media coverage at the time. These events remained unknown in part because they were overshadowed in the French media by the [[Charonne Metro Station massacre]] on 8 February 1962 whose victims were not only Algerians, but also French members of the [[French Communist Party]].

== Reactions ==
On 26 October 1961, [[Georges Montaron]], editor of ''[[Témoignage Chrétien]]'', [[Claude Bourdet]], editor of ''[[France Observateur]]'', [[Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie]], editor of ''[[Libération]]'', Avril, editor of ''[[Télérama]]'', parish priest Lochard, [[Jean-Marie Domenach]], editor of ''Esprit'' magazine, [[Jean Schaeffert]] and [[André Souquière]] organized in the ''[[Maison de la Mutualité]]'' a meeting to "protest against police violence and the repression of the 17 October 1961 demonstration in Paris".

A few days later, some anonymous policemen published a text called ''A group of republican policemen declare...'' (''Un groupe de policiers républicains déclarent...'') on 31 October, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What happened on 17 October 1961 and in the following days against the peaceful demonstrators, on which no weapons were found, morally forces us to bring our testimony and to alert public opinion... All guilty people must be punished. The punishment must be extended to all of the responsible people, those who give orders, those who feign of letting it happen, whatever their high office may be... Among the thousands of Algerians brought to the Parc des Expositions of the Porte de Versailles, tens were killed by blows from rifle butts and pickaxe handles... In one of the extremity of the Neuilly bridge, groups of policemen on one side, CRS on the other, moved slowly towards each other. All the Algerians captured in this huge trap were knocked out and systematically thrown in the Seine. A good hundred people were subjected to this treatment... [In the Parisian police headquarters], torturers threw their victims by tens in the Seine which flows only a few meters from the courtyard, to keep them from being examined by the forensic scientists. Not before having taken their watches and money. Mr. Papon, prefect of the police, and Mr. Legay, general director of the municipal police, assisted to these horrible scenes... These indisputable facts are only a small part of what has happened in these last days and what continues to happen. They are known by the municipal police. The extortions committed by the [[harkis]], the district special brigades, the ''brigades des aggressions et violences'' are not secret any more. The little information given by the newspapers is nothing compared to the truth... We do not sign this text and sincerely regret it. We observe, not without sadness, that the current circumstances do not allow us to do so...&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Einaudi, pp.83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The anonymous authors remained so until the late 1990s although Maurice Papon tried to discover them. In February 1999, its main author, Emile Portzer, former member of the [[Front National (French Resistance)|National Front]] resistance organization during the war, testified in favor of historian Jean-Luc Einaudi during the trial which followed Papon's suit against him (won by Einaudi). On 1 January 1962, Papon declared to the police forces under his orders: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;On 17 October you won... the victory against Algerian terrorism... Your moral interests have been successfully defended, since the aim of the police prefecture's opponents to put in place an investigation committee have been defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Einaudi, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== 8 February 1962 Charonne massacre ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from 8 February --&gt;
On 8 February 1962, another demonstration against the OAS, which had been prohibited by the state, was [[The Charonne Metro Station Massacre|repressed at Charonne metro station]] ([[:fr:Affaire de la station de métro Charonne|Affaire de la station de métro Charonne]]). Nine members of the [[Confédération Générale du Travail|CGT trade union]], most of them French Communist Party members, were killed by the police forces, directed by Maurice Papon under the same government, with [[Roger Frey]] as Minister of Interior, [[Michel Debré]] as Prime Minister and Charles de Gaulle as president, who did all they could to "dissimulate the scale of the 17 October crime" (Jean-Luc Einaudi&lt;ref&gt;Einaudi, p.83.&lt;/ref&gt;). The funerals on 13 February 1962 of the nine persons killed (among them, Fanny Dewerpe) were attended by hundreds of thousands of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Charonne, passé au scalpel de l'historien (interview with historian Alain Dewerpe, member of the Ecole des hautes études en sciences sociales) |date=6 February 2006 | publisher=[[L'Humanité]] | url=https://www.humanite.fr/journal/2006-02-07/2006-02-07-823528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Charonne et le 17 octobre enfin réunis |date=11 February 2006|publisher=[[L'Humanité]]|url=https://www.humanite.fr/journal/2006-02-11/2006-02-11-823808}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alain Dewerpe, ''Charonne, 8 février 1962, anthropologie historique d'un massacre d'Etat'', [[Gallimard]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 February 2007 the [[Place du 8 Février 1962]], a square near the metro station, was dedicated by [[Bertrand Delanoë]], the [[mayor of Paris]], after sprays of flowers were deposited at the foot of a commemorative plaque installed inside the metro station where the killings occurred.

== Reporting ==
According to James J. Napoli, coverage of the massacre by major British and American media sources, such as ''[[The Times]]'', ''TIME'' magazine and ''[[The New York Times]]'', downplayed the severity of the massacre as well as the Paris government's responsibility for the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/0397/9703036.htm |title=The Washington Report on the Middle East: The 1961 Massacre of Algerians in Paris: When the media failed the test}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent events ==
The official death toll was initially three, before the French government acknowledged in 1998 that the massacre occurred and that a vague "several dozen" people were killed.&lt;ref name="ramdani-guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/16/massacre-paris-denied | date = 16 October 2011 | access-date = 20 November 2015 | first = Nabila | last = Ramdani | authorlink = Nabila Ramdani | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | location = London | title = The massacre that Paris denied}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No one has been prosecuted for participation in the killings, because they fell under the general amnesty for crimes committed during the Algerian War. This included on one side French police and military personnel fighting for France; and on the other side various French-ethnic (pro-independence, often communist) and Algerian fighters, for attacks on civilian targets such as cafés, which killed 3,000 civilians.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Forty years after the massacre, in 2001, the event was officially acknowledged by the city of Paris with the placement and unveiling of a memorial plaque near the Pont Saint-Michel.&lt;ref name="LDH" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; This resulted from work by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] local government. At the unveiling of the plaque, [[Bertrand Delanoë]], the Socialist Party [[Mayor of Paris]], cited the need for France to come to terms with this event in order to move forward with unity. Centrist and right-wing politicians, as well as the police union, objected to the plaque on various grounds (increased threat of civil unrest, alleged tolerance of terrorism, and encouragement of disrespect for the police). On the other hand, historian [[Olivier LeCour Grandmaison]], president of the [[NGO|17 October 1961 Association]], declared to ''L'Humanité'' that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;if a step forward had been taken with the decision of the city of Paris to put a commemorative plaque on the Pont Saint-Michel, [he] deplored that the text which was chosen for it invokes neither the idea of a [[crime against humanity]] nor the responsibility of the author of the crime, the state. Thus, in no case does this Parisian initiative exempt the highest national authorities from taking responsibility. In addition, if [former Socialist Prime minister] [[Lionel Jospin]] personally expressed himself last year [in 2000] by speaking of "tragic events", neither the police's responsibility in the crime nor that of those politically responsible at the time have been clearly established, much less officially condemned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Lucien |last=Degoy | title=17 OCTOBRE 1961 Olivier La Cour-Grandmaison: le silence n'est plus de mise|publisher=[[L'Humanité]] | url=https://www.humanite.fr/journal/2001-10-17/2001-10-17-251993 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030927234615/http://humanite.fr/journal/2001-10-17/2001-10-17-251993 |date=17 October 2001 |archivedate=27 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* The massacre was referenced in ''[[Caché (film)|Caché]],'' a 2005 film by [[Michael Haneke]].
* The 2005 French television drama-documentary ''Nuit noire, 17 octobre 1961'' explores in detail the events of the massacre. It follows the lives of several people and also shows some of the divisions within the Paris police, with some openly arguing for more violence while others tried to uphold the rule of law.
* ''Drowning by Bullets'', a television documentary in the British ''[[Secret History (TV series)|Secret History]]'' series, first shown on 13 July 1992.
* The massacre is the subject of [[Leïla Sebbar]]'s 1999 novel ''The Seine was Red: Paris, October 1961'' (''La Seine était rouge (Paris, octobre 1961'')).
* The massacre is described in the opening verse of Irish punk rock band [[Stiff Little Fingers]] song 'When The Stars Fall From The Sky'.
* French rapper [[Médine (rapper)|Médine]] dedicates a whole song to the massacre on his album ''Table d'écoute''.
* It forms the core of [[Didier Daeninckx]]' 1984 thriller ''[[Meurtres pour mémoire]]'', which is also the first attempt to mine the archives of the massacre through the form of a fictional enquiry. However, expatriate American novelist and journalist [[William Gardner Smith]]'s 1963 novel ''The Stone Face'', is now recognized as the earliest known fictional treatment of the events surrounding this infamous event.&lt;ref name="KRoss" /&gt; Although the "body count" of this massacre is listed in many places (including this Wikipedia article) at 140 dead or missing, writer and social critic [[Kristin Ross]] points out otherwise while invoking Smith's and Daeninckx's work: 

{{quote|African-American novelist William Gardner Smith put the figure at "over two hundred" in his 1963 novel, ''The Stone Face''. It is a mark of the success surrounding the official blackout of information about October 17 that Smith's novel, written by a foreigner in France and published in the United States (it could not be published in France), would stand as one of the few representations of the event available all the way up until the early 1990s–until the moment, that is, when a generation of young ''Beurs'', as the children of North African immigrants call themselves, had reached an age at which they could begin to demand information about their parents' fate. Professional or academic historians have lagged well behind amateurs in the attempt to discover what occurred on October 17; investigative journalists, militants, and fiction writers like Smith, or the much more widely read detective novelist, Didier Daeninckx, kept a trace of the event alive during the thirty years when it had entered a "black hole" of memory.&lt;ref name="KRoss"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Kristin |authorlink= |author2= |editor= |others= |title= May '68 And Its Afterlives|origyear= |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2002 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL &amp; London |isbn=978-0-226-72799-8 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=44 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Pennsylvania Anatomy Act of 1883''' is legislation of the State of [[Pennsylvania]] to facilitate [[medical education]]. This act allowed teachers and students to be able to [[Dissection|dissect bodies]] without have to resort to buying from [[Body snatching|grave robbers]] or buying body parts. This act was written to prevent [[Grave robbery|grave robbing]], and to even out the availability of corpses.

== Background ==
{{Main|History of anatomy in the nineteenth century|Anatomy Act of 1832}}
Prior to the Pennsylvania Anatomy Act being passed in 1883, many other dissection acts were passed in America. These acts included the Massachusetts Act of 1784,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b9A9AQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA361&amp;ots=4q90mtNMMs&amp;dq=massachusetts%20anatomy%20act%20of%201784&amp;pg=PA361#v=onepage&amp;q=massachusetts%20anatomy%20act%20of%201784&amp;f=false|title=The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal|date=1880-01-01|publisher=Cupples, Upham &amp; Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which stated that those that died or were executed due to dueling may be dissected. The next act was an act in [[New York (state)|New York]] called An Act to Prevent the Odious Practice of Digging up and Removing, for the Purpose of Dissection, Dead Bodies Interred in Cemeteries or Burial Places. This act was one of the first acts in America to prevent grave robbing for dissection, the first section says that anyone convicted of removing a dead body for the purpose of dissection, intending to dissect, dissecting or assisting with the dissection shall suffer consequences. So that learning about [[anatomy]] using dissection is not harmed when someone is convicted of murder, arson, or burglary they are then either sentenced to death, and the judges may decide that the offender's body be used for dissection or their body is buried.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marketfordeath.com/timelineofanatomyacts|title=A Market for Death|last=Scovil|first=Lindsay|date=2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1831 [[Massachusetts]] passed an act saying that the bodies of the unclaimed deceased be delivered to the anatomists, under certain restrictions. In 1835 [[Missouri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GCwC9JMUh2EC&amp;pg=PA45|title=Slavery and Crime in Missouri, 1773-1865|last=Frazier|first=Harriet C.|date=2001-01-01|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786409778|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed executed [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] along with convicted criminal's bodies to be dissected. The 1854 [[Bone Bill]] in New York allowed the unclaimed bodies of criminals or the homeless to be sent to medical schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oshinsky|first=David|title=Bellevue: Three centuries of medicine and mayhem at America's most storied hospital|year=2016|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=9780385523363|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867 the city of [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania and the county of [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny]] in Pennsylvania, passed an act, that gave each medical school, in the public and private sectors, within Philadelphia and Allegheny county Pennsylvania the same amount of unclaimed bodies per student. Therefore, a larger [[Medical school in the United States|medical school]] would get more bodies than a small school of 20 students, such as if a school were to have 200 medical students they would get 50 bodies, but if a school were to have 25 medical students they would receive 12-13 bodies.  If a person claimed that they wanted to be buried prior to death, then their body would not be allowed to be given to these medical schools, they would instead be buried despite being unclaimed. Another part of this act punished the anatomists if they were caught selling the spare bodies or spare body parts, the same punishment applied for the grave robbers and someone caught buying the spare bodies or spare body parts. This act later on was made into seven sections and would include all of the [[List of counties in Pennsylvania|counties of Pennsylvania]], instead of one county and a major city, and would become what we know today as the Pennsylvania Anatomy Act of 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forbes|first1=W.S|title=History of the Anatomy Act of Pennsylvania|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/dissecting_room-1911-scalpel_wmcp_yearbook-p39.jpg|website=Jefferson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provisions of the Act ==
The Act stated that all bodies used for medical advancements must be obtained in a legal manner, through the state, so as to prevent the [[Ethics|unethical]] obtaining of corpses. The Act also allowed for the use of unclaimed bodies for medical research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Section One of the Act specified the creation of a board of scholars that would be tasked with the delivery of corpses. This board of scholars would be made up of no less than 25 scholars elected by each of the dentistry, surgery, and medical schools within the Pennsylvania Commonwealth. The board would be tasked with the record keeping of each corpse delivered, and who the corpse was delivered to.

Specifications for the distribution of corpses were put into place by Section Three of the Act. Bodies would first be delivered to schools in need of bodies for demonstrations and lectures. Bodies remaining after the initial need was met were to be allotted based on the number of students in each class.

Section Five of the bill stated that the distribution of corpses illegally over Commonwealth boundaries would be considered body trafficking. It was further specified that such trafficking would be charged as a [[misdemeanor]] offense, resulting in up to a 200 dollar fine or a one-year sentence in prison.

Members of the board who do not perform their duties as required will be subject to up to a 500 dollar fine, as specified by Section Seven of the Act.

== Passage of the Bill ==
The initial Act was accepted by the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], but opposed in the senate by one senator who claimed that the Act was, "unworthy of the age in which [they] live".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=1867|title=Passage of an Anatomy Act in Pennsylvania: An Act for the Promotion of Medical Science, and to Prevent the Traffic in Human Bodies|url=|journal=Chicago Medical Examiner|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opposition caused the Act to be rewritten and re-submitted for consideration. The act was then rewritten, and it was passed in both the House and [[Pennsylvania State Senate|Senate]] in the year 1883.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Extent and Effect ==
* In 1879, a version of this act was enacted into [[Indiana]] and [[Ohio]] law, stemming from a corpse that was acquired under false pretenses and used at the Ohio Medical College. This body was [[John Scott Harrison]], a late [[United States House of Representatives|United States Congressman]] and son of [[William Henry Harrison|President William Henry Harrison]]. 
* By 1881, a survey disclosed that 15 of 38 states had "liberal" anatomy acts, nine of them had "illiberal" anatomy acts, and 14 states had none.  
* By 1913, there were 39 states with medical schools, like [[Alabama]], that still lacked Anatomy acts.  
* January 1, 1889. In order to carry the Pennsylvania Anatomy Act of 1883 into execution, the attention of all state, county, and municipal officers charged with duties under the law were directed towards fulfilling its requirements. The coffins containing bodies should be sent to George Willie, of Philadelphia. The coffins should be delivered to the agent of the express company at the train station nearest to the location where the body is to be sent. The transportation charges were sent to the railroad station, and were to be paid by the agent of the express company, and collected from the board of scholars by the agent in Philadelphia.  
* Based on research from the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the Anatomy committee's opinion was that the law of the State of Pennsylvania was the best created for anatomy acts. It was designed in good frame to be able to provide necessary anatomical material for the promotion of Medical Science under strict execution. The act also protected the buried bodies safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anatomical Law of the State of Pennsylvania|last=|first=|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1624701.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Perth Mint''' is [[Australia]]'s official [[bullion]] [[Mint (coin)|mint]] and wholly owned by the [[Government of Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perthmint.com.au/about_us_the_perth_mint_group_structure.aspx|title=Group Structure {{!}} The Perth Mint|website=www.perthmint.com.au|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established on 20 June 1899, two years before [[Federation of Australia|Australia's Federation]] in 1901, the Perth Mint was the last of three Australian colonial branches of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal Mint]] (after the now-defunct [[Sydney Mint]] and [[Melbourne Mint]]) intended to refine gold from the [[gold rush]]es and to mint [[gold sovereign]]s and [[half-sovereign]]s for the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perthtouristcentre.com.au/perth-attractions/|title=Attractions in Perth Western Australia|work=Perth Tourist Centre|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the [[Royal Australian Mint]], which produces [[coins of the Australian dollar]] for circulation, the Perth Mint is the older of the two mints issuing coins that are [[legal tender]] in Australia.

==History==

After the foundation stone was laid in 1896 by Sir [[John Forrest]], the Mint opened on 20 June 1899. At that time, [[Western Australia]]'s population was growing rapidly (23,000 in 1869 and 180,000 in 1900) due largely to the discovery of rich gold deposits in [[Coolgardie, Western Australia|Coolgardie]], [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]] and [[Murchison (Western Australia)|Murchison]] areas of the colony.

As there was very little money available in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] for which miners could exchange gold to pay for goods, the Diggers who flocked to the then colony of [[Western Australia]] in huge numbers from other parts of Australia and from around the world, deposited their raw gold at the Perth Mint where it was minted into gold coins.

Although [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] occurred in 1901, the Mint remained under the jurisdiction of [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] until 1 July 1970, when it became a statutory authority of the [[Government of Western Australia]].

From 1899 to 1931, the Perth Mint struck more than 106 million gold sovereigns, and nearly 735,000 half-sovereigns (intermittently between 1900 and 1920), for use as [[currency]] in Australia and throughout the British Empire. The Mint stopped making gold sovereigns when Britain abandoned the [[gold standard]] in 1931. Nevertheless, the [[Refining (metallurgy)|refinery]] remained busy as staff turned their skills to making fine gold [[bullion]] bars. But it was not long before the Mint was involved again in the production of coins. During [[World War II]], the Perth Mint began minting the Australian [[coin]]age from [[base metal]]s. Up until the end of 1983, the Perth Mint also manufactured much of Australia's lower-denomination [[coin]] currency.&lt;ref name=gold-net/&gt; 

The Perth Mint achieved "arguably the purest of all gold" in 1957 when the mint produced a {{convert|adj=on|13|ozt|g}} proof plate of six nines - [[Fineness#Gold|999.999 parts of gold per thousand]].&lt;ref name=90GoldenYears/&gt;{{rp|58}} The Royal Mint was so impressed that it ordered some of the gold as the [[Benchmarking|benchmark]] for its own standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perthmint.com.au/visit_the_mint_the_perth_mint_history.aspx|title=History|publisher=The Perth Mint|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mint's new direction was formalised in 1987 with the creation of [[Gold Corporation]] by a State Act of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/legislation/statutes.nsf/main_mrtitle_390_homepage.html Gold Corporation Act 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; Under a unique agreement with the [[Commonwealth of Australia]]'s Department of the Treasury, the Mint's new operator was empowered to mint and market gold, silver and platinum Australian [[legal tender]] coinage to investors and collectors worldwide. Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] launched the [[Australian Gold Nugget|Australian Nugget Gold Coins Series]] in 1987. The first day's trading yielded sales of 155,000 ounces of gold worth $103 million, well above the sales target of 130,000 ounces to the end of June. Today, the Perth Mint is a member of an elite group of world mints whose pure gold, silver and platinum legal tender coins are trusted without question. Like the Australian Nugget, its Australian Kookaburra Silver Coin Series and Australian Lunar Gold and Silver Coin Series are extensively sought after by bullion investors worldwide.

Up to 2000, the Mint's refined gold output totalled 4,500 [[tonnes]], representing 3.25% of the total weight of gold produced by humankind. This is about the current holdings of gold [[bullion]] in the [[United States Treasury]]'s [[Fort Knox Bullion Depository]].&lt;ref name=gold-net&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold-net.com.au/archivemagazines/sep02/69328603.html#3|title=The Perth Mint|work=Gold-Net Australia Online|date=September 2002 |accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Perth Mint officially opened an 8,400 square metre state-of-the-art [[manufacturing]] facility next door to its original [[limestone]] building. Dominating the Mint's heritage precinct, these two important buildings are powerful symbols of more than 100 years of minting excellence in Western Australia.

In October 2011, the Perth Mint created the world's largest, heaviest and most valuable gold coin, breaking the record previously held by the [[Royal Canadian Mint]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15477426 Australia unveils world's largest gold coin in Perth]&lt;/ref&gt; The coin is approximately {{convert|80|cm|inch}} in diameter and {{convert|12|cm|inch}} thick, and made of {{convert|1012|kg|lb}} of 99.99% pure gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/perth-mint-unveils-53m-coin/story-e6frg6nf-1226178568316|title=Perth mint unveils $53m coin|publisher=The Australian|date=27 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319052622/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/perth-mint-unveils-53m-coin/story-e6frg6nf-1226178568316|archivedate=19 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features, on the [[obverse]] side, the effigy of Elizabeth II, and a red kangaroo on the reverse side. It is legal tender in Australia with face value {{AUD}}1 million, but at the time of minting it was valued at {{AUD}}53.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/worlds-biggest-gold-coin-worth-53m-20111027-1mlk9.html|title=World's biggest gold coin worth $53m|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=27 October 2011|access-date=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Mint continues to provide refining and other services to the gold industry and manufactures many coin related [[numismatic]] items for investors and [[coin collectors]]. It is responsible for manufacturing and marketing most of Australia's legal tender precious metal coins, including [[proof coinage|proof]] quality [[Australian Nugget]] gold coins, Australian [[Platinum Koala]] coins, [[Australian Silver Kookaburra]] coins, Swan series&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://goldadvert.com/knowledgebase/en/australian-gold-and-silver-coins-of-the-swan-series/|title=Australian gold and silver coins of the Swan series|date=2018-07-09|work=Knowledge base - GoldAdvert|access-date=2018-08-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; coins and [[bullion]].

==Cryptocurrency==
In January 2018, the Perth Mint announced it would produce a [[blockchain]] based [[cryptocurrency]] backed by its own bullion (a [[digital gold currency]]) in approximately the next 12 to 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=24 January 2018|publisher =Australian Broadcasting Corporation |title=Cryptocurrency backed by gold being developed by Perth Mint to entice investors back to precious metals|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-24/cryptocurrency-backed-by-gold-being-developed-perth-mint/9352036|access-date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prince Albert’s Model Cottage''' was the name given to a model dwelling designed in the mid-19th century to offer an alternative form of accommodation for poor families in England. It was supported by [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], husband of [[Queen Victoria]].

==History==
[[File:Prince-Alberts-Model-Lodging-House-Hyde-Park.jpg|thumb|An early illustration of the cottages]]
The original Prince Albert's Model Cottage, also known as the Prince Consort Model Lodge, was built by the [[Labourer's Friend Society|Society for Improving the Conditions of the Labouring Classes]] (SICLC) for display at the [[The Great Exhibition|1851 Great Exhibition]] in [[Hyde Park, London]]. Prince Albert, who had considerable interest in improved housing for the poor, was president of the Society.&lt;ref name="londonphile"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Albert's Model Cottages|url=http://thelondonphile.com/2012/05/02/prince-alberts-model-cottages/|website=thelondonphile|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society wanted to have the [[Model dwellings company|model dwelling]]  built on the Exhibition grounds, but the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851|Exhibition commissioners]] were unwilling to have an exhibit that addressed such social issues. With the intervention of Prince Albert it was agreed that the building could be constructed close to, but not on, the Exhibition grounds, and this was done at the [[Hyde Park Barracks, London|Knightsbridge Cavalry Barracks]]. At the conclusion of the Great Exhibition the cottage was dismantled and rebuilt in [[Kennington]].&lt;ref name="Barbara"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leckie|first1=Barbara|title=Prince Albert’s Exhibition Model Dwellings|url=http://www.branchcollective.org/?ps_articles=barbara-leckie-prince-alberts-exhibition-model-dwellings|website=Branch Collective|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By one estimate over 250,000 people visited the cottage, including Queen Victoria and [[Charles Dickens]]. The final room visited contained pamphlets and books on model dwellings, as well as the architectural plans for the building through which the visitor had just walked, together with plans of other model dwellings built elsewhere by the society.&lt;ref name=Barbara /&gt;

==Design==
The model cottage was designed by [[Henry Roberts (architect)|Henry Roberts]], who was honorary architect to the SICLC, and, like the Prince Consort, was interested in upgrading housing for the [[working class]]. The cottage demonstrated at the Great Exhibition was possibly conceived as a model for larger blocks of flats (designs for a three-storey version were prepared).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Curl|first1=James Stevens|title=The life and work of Henry Roberts, 1803–1876: the evangelical conscience and the campaign for model housing and healthy nations|date=1983|publisher=Phillimore|location=Chichester, Sussex|isbn=9780850334463|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to house four families, with two flats, or apartments, on each level. Roberts indicated that the design was aimed at “the class of mechanical and manufacturing operatives who usually reside in towns or in their immediate vicinity”.&lt;ref name=londonphile /&gt; Each flat had a living room, with a built-in cupboard heated by the fireplace that was also "well contrived equally to cook the family meals at midday and to warm the feet of the family group at eve",&lt;ref name="Spectator"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Albert's Cottages|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/14th-june-1851/12/prince-alberts-cottages|website=Spectator Archives|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a kitchen/scullery, three bedrooms and a toilet. Bathrooms were not usually provided in houses built in England at this time. Three bedrooms were included for the sake of "decency" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sayer|first1=Karen|title=Country cottages: a cultural history|date=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=9780719047527|page=c6}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that children of the same sex would not have to share a room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tarn|first1=John Nelson|title=Five per cent philanthropy: an account of housing in urban areas between 1840 and 1914|date=1973|publisher=Cambridge U. P.|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521085063|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most notable external feature was the covered central staircase to give access to the two upper flats. Hollow bricks were used for construction of the building. These were claimed to be sound resistant, damp resistant, non-porous, and cheap to make. The internal face of the walls was smooth and plastering was considered unnecessary.&lt;ref name=Barbara /&gt;&lt;ref name="BritishHistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kennington Common Land|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol26/pp31-36|website=British history on line|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KP-Alberts-Cottage2.jpg|thumb|The original Prince Albert Cottage, in Kennington]]

==Subsequent developments==

Although built outside the main Great Exhibition area, the Prince Albert cottage exhibit was awarded one of the 170 Council Medals, the Exhibition’s highest award.&lt;ref name=Barbara /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Council Medal for the Great Exhibition of 1851|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1264180/council-medal-for-the-great-medal-william-wyon/|website=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design provided a catalyst for further work on model buildings and Roberts and the Society circulated several publications on the topic, including ''“The Dwellings of the Labouring Classes”''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Henry|title=The Dwellings of the Labouring Classes|date=1850|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=9NNbAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1852 the cottage was rebuilt in [[Kennington Park]], south of the River Thames, and housed two park attendants and a cottage museum. Subsequently it was occupied by the park superintendent and since 2003 has been the headquarters of the [[Trees for Cities]] charity. The design was used in several other locations, including Stepney and Kensington in London and [[Abbots Langley]] and [[Hertford]], both in [[Hertfordshire]]. However, despite benefiting from the abolition of Britain's [[brick tax]] in 1850,&lt;ref name="Spectator" /&gt; and while a success with the public, the cottages were not a commercial success, although the ''Spectator'' had calculated that a return on capital of between five and seven percent per annum would be possible.&lt;ref name="Spectator" /&gt; The innovative use of hollow bricks was also never widely copied.&lt;ref name=BritishHistory /&gt;

Between 792–793 and 796 a '''Qays-Yaman war''' (also referred to as the '''War of the Watermelon'''&lt;ref name="LevyKedar65"&gt;Levy-Rubin and Kedar 2001, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Linder22"&gt;Linder 2007, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;) took place in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]] between the northern [[Arab]] tribal federation of Mudhar, also called Nizar or [[Qays]], and the southern tribal confederation of Yaman and the latter's [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] allies. The conflict may have begun as early as 787/88, though specific outbreaks of the war are largely dated to 793 and 796. Some violence by Bedouin raiders in the [[Judean Desert]] also erupted in 797, though it is not clear if this was directly related to the [[Qays-Yaman rivalry|Qaysi-Yamani conflict]].

==Background==
In the 8th century, Palestine and Transjordan were functioning as two administrative districts: [[Jund Filastin]] and [[Jund al-Urdunn]]. Jund Filastin stretched from [[Rafah]] to [[Lajjun]], encompassing much of the coastal plain of Palestine and included [[Samaria]] and [[Mount Hebron]], while Jund al-Urdunn consisted of the [[Galilee]], [[Jabal Amil]], and most of [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]] (east of the [[Jordan River]]). Both districts were a part of the larger province of [[Bilad ash-Sham]] of the Abbasid Caliphate. The [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] annexed Bilad ash-Sham after defeating the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad dynasty]] in 750. The capital of the [[Caliphate]] was subsequently moved from [[Damascus]] to [[Baghdad]], and Palestine consequently lost its central position in the state, becoming a distant district whose affairs were not as closely monitored or regulated as they were under the Umayyads. The Abbasids were also facing difficulties suppressing rebellions throughout the Caliphate at the time of the intertribal hostilities in Palestine.&lt;ref name="LevyKedar65"/&gt; Various Arab tribes populated the regions of Palestine and Transjordan and formed confederations. The Mudhar (also referred to as [[Qais|Qays]] or Nizar) faction, led by Amir ibn Umara al-Murri, represented the northern tribes, while the Yamani faction represented the southern tribes.&lt;ref name="Gil283"&gt;Gil 1997, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibrahim ibn Salih]], the governor of Bilad ash-Sham and a cousin of the caliph [[al-Mahdi]], regularly dealt with the affairs in Jund Filastin. He and his aide, Ishaq ibn Ibrahim tended to favor the Yamani tribe in its disputes with the Mudhar.&lt;ref name="Gil284"/&gt;

According to an account by a Christian source from the time, the towns of [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Bayt Jibrin]], [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]] in Jund Filastin and Sariphaea in Jund al-Urdunn were destroyed in 788, or during the reign of [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch]] [[Elias II of Jerusalem|Elias II]] (r. 770–797), during the hostilities between the Abbasids and a force of rebels commanded by Yahya ibn Irmiya, a [[Jew]] from Transjordan.&lt;ref name="Gil283"/&gt;

==War==

===First outbreak===
According to 9th-century historian [[al-Tabari]], clashes between the Arab tribes of Palestine had begun in 790/91, while 15th-century [[Ibn Taghribirdi]] wrote that the conflict began as early as 787/88.&lt;ref name="LevyKedar65"/&gt; The 12th-century Syriac Orthodox patriarch, [[Michael the Syrian]] and 13th-century historian [[Ali ibn al-Athir|Ibn al-Athir]] asserted that the conflict started in 792/93.&lt;ref&gt;Linder 2007, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the latter, hostilities commenced following an incident where a member of the northern [[Banu al-Qayn]] tribe came to grind his wheat at a location in the [[Balqa Governorate|al-Balqa]] region of Transjordan and stole marrows and watermelons from a southern tribesman (either from the [[Banu Judham]] or [[Banu Lakhm]] tribes).&lt;ref name="Gil284"&gt;Gil 1997, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Casualties became considerable as tribes from the [[Golan Heights]] and Jund al-Urdunn joined the war as allies of the Yamani coalition. The strife was brought to an end and violence calmed down by 29 December 793, after decisive intervention by the new caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] and his brothers.&lt;ref name="Gil284"/&gt;

===Second outbreak===
In 796, battles between the Mudhar and Yamani tribes broke out again for unspecified reasons. It is presumed by historian Moshe Gil that the northern Mudhar tribes instigated the hostilities and that the focus of their attacks was directed not only against the Yamani federation, but the Abbasid state itself. Harun al-Rashid viewed this as a rebellion and dispatched a large army headed by [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Ja'far ibn Yahya al-Barmaki]] to quell the revolt.&lt;ref name="Gil284"/&gt; Battles between the two sides erupted throughout Palestine, and during a major confrontation near Jerusalem, Ibn al-Athir wrote that 800 Yamani tribesmen were killed, while 600 (or 300) Mudhari tribesmen were killed. According to a 10th-century Christian source, one side suffered 80 dead and the other side, 60.&lt;ref name="Linder22"/&gt; According to Gil, al-Barmaki "put down the rebels with an iron hand and much blood was spilled."&lt;ref name="Gil283"/&gt; Al-Barmaki assigned Issa ibn al-Akki as his representative for the whole province of Bilad ash-Sham, while he appointed Salih bin Sulayman as his representative in al-Balqa. Thus, Jund al-Urdunn, which had normally been under the authority of the governor of Damascus, gained separate administration. This was a result of al-Barmaki's belief that Transjordan was the epicenter of the rebellion.&lt;ref name="Gil284"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Abbasid governor of Jund Filastin, [[Harthama ibn A'yan]], was reassigned to Egypt in 796.&lt;ref name="Gil284"/&gt; During and after the war, anarchy became widespread in Palestine.&lt;ref name="LevyKedar65"/&gt; In addition, the main roads of the district were rendered impassable due to the presence of hostile Bedouin bands.&lt;ref&gt;Palestine Exploration Fund 1872, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Various Arab tribes that previously attempted to raid the Christian monasteries of the [[Judean Desert]], but were prevented from doing so by the state authorities, took advantage of the security vacuum and attacked several of them. The St. Chariton Monastery was robbed and on 20 March 796&lt;ref name="LevyKedar65"/&gt; or 19 March 797,&lt;ref name="Linder23"&gt;Linder 2007, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; 20–28 monks at [[Mar Saba]] were reportedly suffocated to death or cremated,&lt;ref name="LevyKedar65"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Linder23"/&gt; while around 100 monks were assaulted.&lt;ref name="Linder23"/&gt; The monasteries of St. Cyriacus, [[al-Ubeidiya|St. Theodosius]] and [[Laura of Euthymius|St. Euthymius]] were also raided at some point during or after the hostilities.&lt;ref name="LevyKedar65"/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Sanja Matsuri'''|三社祭||literally "Three Shrine Festival"}}, or '''Sanja Festival''', is one of the three great [[Shinto]] [[festivals in Tokyo]]. It is considered one of the wildest and largest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoteltravel.com/japan/guides/festivals.htm#sanja_matsuri |title=Japan Events and Festivals |accessdate=2008-05-07 |work=HotelTravel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is held in honor of Hinokuma Hamanari, Hinokuma Takenari, and Hajino Nakatomo, the three men who established and founded the [[Sensō-ji]] Buddhist temple. Sanja Matsuri is held on the third weekend of every May at [[Asakusa Shrine]]. Its prominent parades revolve around three ''[[mikoshi]]'' (portable shrines referenced in the festival's name), as well as traditional music and dancing. Over the course of three days, the festival attracts 1.5 to 2&amp;nbsp;million locals and tourists every year.&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/685/feature.asp |title=Festival Frenzy |accessdate=2008-03-05 |work=[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]] |author=Graham, Fiona |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080221001537/http://www.metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/685/feature.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Like many [[japanese festival|Japanese festivals]], Sanja Matsuri is a religious celebration. It is a weekend-long Shinto festival that is dedicated to the ''[[kami]]'' (spirits) of three men. It is believed that two fishermen—brothers named Hinokuma Hamanari and Hinokuma Takenari—found a statuette of the [[Bodhisattva]] [[Kannon]] caught in a fishing net in the [[Sumida River]] on the early morning of March 18, 628.&lt;ref name="wgs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.senso-ji.jp/guide/komagata_e.html |title=Guide to Senso Ji's Halls – Komagatado Hall |accessdate=2014-05-08 |}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third man, a wealthy landlord named Hajino Nakatomo, heard about the discovery, approached the brothers and converted them to [[Buddhism]]. The three men then devoted their lives to the Buddhist faith and consecrated the statue in a small temple.&lt;ref name="asakusashrine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asakusajinja.jp/english/ |title=Asakusa Shrine |accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This temple, now known as the [[Sensō-ji]], currently houses the Kannon statue and is the oldest temple in Tokyo.

The Sanja Matsuri appears to have many forms that date back as early as the 7th century, as well as several names such as "Kannon Matsuri" and "Asakusa Matsuri".&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asakusajinja.jp/sanjamatsuri/yurai.html |script-title=ja:三社祭とは? |accessdate=2008-03-21 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanja Matsuri's present day form was established during the [[Edo period]]. In 1649, ''[[shōgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Iemitsu]] commissioned the construction of [[Asakusa Shrine]], a [[Shinto shrine]] dedicated to the three ''kami''. The existence of this shrine helped to solidify the festival's importance as well as its current structure and organization.&lt;ref name="bella"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art29889.asp |title=Japanese Festivals&amp;nbsp;— Sanja Matsuri (Day 2) |accessdate=2008-03-05 |author=Turner, Taisha |work=BellaOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of events==

[[File:Asakusa Matsuri Senso-ji May06.JPG|right|thumb|Asakusa Sanja Festival – a portable Shrine lifted in front of Sensō-ji temple.]]

Religious in origin, Sanja Matsuri is primarily a festival of celebration. The atmosphere around [[Asakusa]] during the weekend of the festival is charged and energetic. People continuously flood the streets surrounding the Sensō-ji and flutes, whistles, chanting and ''[[taiko]]'' (traditional Japanese drums) can be heard throughout the district.

The festival's main attractions are three Asakusa Shrine-owned ''[[mikoshi]]'' that appear on the third and final day of the festival. These three elaborate, black [[lacquer]]ed-wood shrines are built to act as miniature, portable versions of Asakusa Shrine. Decorated with gold sculptures and painted with [[gold leaf]], each ''mikoshi'' weighs approximately one&amp;nbsp;ton and cost [[Japanese Yen|¥]]40&amp;nbsp;million ($390,760 in 2008) to construct.&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt; They are carried on four long poles lashed together with ropes, and each needs approximately 40&amp;nbsp;people dispersed evenly to safely carry them. Throughout the day, a total of about 500&amp;nbsp;people participate in carrying each shrine.&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt;

Because of the importance of these three ''mikoshi'', they are spectacles as they are carried through the streets. The areas immediately surrounding each shrine are busy with people, and as they are carried, they are shaken and bounced vehemently. This action is believed to intensify the power of the ''[[kami]]'' that are seated in the shrines and helps to bestow good luck upon their respective neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="excelloz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.excelloz.com/Travel_guide/Tokyo/Sanja_Matsuri_Festival_of_Asakusa_Shrine_Tokyo.html |title=Sanja Matsuri: Unique traditional Festival of Japan in Asakusa, Tokyo |accessdate=2008-03-05 |author=Miller, David |work=Excelloz Travel}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not unusual for there to be someone standing on the poles supporting the ''mikoshi'' shouting and waving in order to help direct the people carrying the shrine. This sense of direction can be essential when trying to keep the one&amp;nbsp;ton ''mikoshi'' from accidentally colliding with street-side shops and causing considerable damage.&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt;

While the three primary ''mikoshi'' are the most important objects roaming the streets during the Sanja Matsuri, approximately 100 other smaller ''mikoshi'' are paraded through the neighborhood on Saturday. Of these shrines, several are solely carried by women or small children.&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt;

===Day by day===

[[File:Sunday night parade Sanja Matsuri 2006.JPG|thumb|People paraded through the Nakamise during Sanja Matsuri.]]
[[File:Float during Sanja Matsuri 2006.JPG|right|thumb|A music float is carried down [[Sensō-ji#Nakamise-dōri|Nakamise-dōri]] late Sunday night]]

Though not a part of the festivities, the official start of the Sanja Matsuri begins on Thursday with an important religious ceremony. This ceremony requires Asakusa Shrine's [[kannushi|head priest]] to perform a ritual that moves the enshrined ''kami'' of the three men at Asakusa Shrine to the three ''mikoshi'' that will be paraded around the Asakusa during the weekend.&lt;ref name="schedule"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asakusajinja.jp/sanjamatsuri/nittei.html |script-title=ja:日程 |accessdate=2008-03-21 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; By opening the small doors located on each ''mikoshi'' (the interior is obscured to the public by a small cotton curtain), the three spirits are invited into the miniature shrines where they will reside for the duration of the festival.&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt;

The festival's more publicized beginning starts on Friday when the {{nihongo|''Daigyōretsu''|大行列||literally "large parade"}} is held.&lt;ref name="excelloz"/&gt; This famous 19-block grand procession down Yanagi Street and [[Sensō-ji#Nakamise-dōri|Nakamise-dōri]] to Asakusa Shrine is an event that is used to energize the community. It is most known for its participants' lavish costumes, such as [[heron]]-hooded dancers, [[geisha]] and city officials wearing ''[[hakama]]'' (traditional Japanese clothing).&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt; Musicians, performers and dancers also parade down the streets of Asakusa in traditional Japanese attire during the procession. In the evening, six ''mikoshi'' from the most central neighborhoods are sent parading through the streets on the shoulders of several dozen people.&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt;

On the following day, Saturday, approximately 100&amp;nbsp;''mikoshi'' from the 44&amp;nbsp;Asakusa districts gather at the [[Kaminarimon]].&lt;ref name="bella"/&gt; They are then paraded through Nakamise-dōri and stop at the [[Hōzōmon]] where they pay their respects to [[Kannon]], the Goddess of Mercy. Afterwards, the ''mikoshi'' are carried to [[Asakusa Shrine]] where [[Shinto]] priests bless and purify them for the coming year.&lt;ref name="bella"/&gt; When the ceremony is completed, they are then carried back and paraded through their respective neighborhoods.

Sanja Matsuri's most important events occurs on the following Sunday. The procession of the three Asakusa Shrine-owned ''mikoshi'' begin their march down Nakamise-dōri toward the Kaminarimon early Sunday morning. These three elaborate shrines honor and represent the three men responsible for founding the [[Sensō-ji]]. During this final day of the festival, these important ''mikoshi'' are split up in order to visit and bestow blessing to all 44&amp;nbsp;districts of downtown and residential Asakusa. When evening falls, the three shrines find their way back to Asakusa Shrine in another grand procession that lasts late into the night.&lt;ref name="digital"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalmatsuri.com/?p=3 |title=The Asakusa Sanja Matsuri |accessdate=2008-04-08 |date=2006-05-21 |work=The Digital Matsuri Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other attractions==

In addition to the traditional events, Sanja Matsuri has several other popular draws. For example, festival goers can visit hundreds of shops found in the Nakamise, a street connecting the Kaminarimon and the Hōzōmon. Many small food stands are also erected in the surrounding areas for the entire weekend. [[Yakuza]] members also proudly show off their tattoos.&lt;ref name="asiarooms"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/japan/japan-festivals-&amp;-events/sanja-matsuri-festival.html |title=Sanja Matsuri Festival |accessdate=2008-06-30 |work=AsiaRooms.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other spectacles that draw crowds are the [[Geisha]] and ''[[taiko]]'' performances that take place at specific times throughout the weekend. On Saturday and Sunday, Geisha that don their traditional attire put on performances from 1–3&amp;nbsp;p.m. on the second floor of the Asakusa Kenban. These performances, which require visitors to purchase tickets, have been ranked as one of the 10 best Geisha shows in all of Japan.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gojapan.about.com/od/geisha/tp/bestgeishashow.htm |title=Top 10 Geisha Shows |accessdate=2008-04-08 |work=[[About.com]] |author=Mishima, Shizuko}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Sunday afternoon, members of the Nihon Taiko Dojo, a prominent Tokyo ''taiko'' academy, perform a free half-hour traditional music show at Asakusa Shrine.&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt;

==Festival schedule==
Though there are many activities during Sanja Matsuri that are not time dependent, there are a few events that start and stop at specific times throughout the weekend.

The '''Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz''' (''State Theatre at Gärtnerplatz''), commonly called the '''Gärtnerplatztheater''', is an [[opera house]] and [[opera]] company in [[Munich]]. (The "Gärtnerplatz" is an urban square in the borough [[Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt]].) Designed by Michael Reiffenstuel, it opened on 4 November 1865 as the city's second major theatre after the [[National Theatre Munich|National Theatre]].

At times exclusively concerned with [[operetta]], in recent years there have also been productions of opera, musicals and ballet. The scope of activities is similar to that of the [[Komische Oper]] in Berlin and the [[English National Opera]] in London.

One of the most active theatres in [[Germany]], its season lasts from September to July and comprises more than 200 performances.  The current [[intendant]] is Josef Ernst Köpplinger.

== History ==
In 1863, a committee for the founding of a ''Volkstheater'' (people's theatre) formed. [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] authorized a new building in the borough Isarvorstadt on 10 May 1864. It was designed by [[Franz Michael Reiffenstuel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordostkultur-muenchen.de/biographien/reiffenstruel.htm Die Reiffenstuels]&lt;/ref&gt; who modelled it after the [[Nationaltheater München|Nationaltheater]] in [[Classicist architecture|classicist style]].{{sfn|Munich|2018}}{{sfn|Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz|1965|p=43}} The groundbreaking was on 25 August 1864, and the ''Richtfest'' was celebrated on 27 May 1865.{{sfn|Busse|1924|pp=13–15}} The house was opened on 4 November 1865,{{sfn|Hußlein|2015}} with [[Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria]] representing the king. The opening performance was a Prologue followed by an allegorical festive play (''Festspiel'') by Hermann Schmid, ''Was wir wollen'' (What we want), with music by {{ill|Georg Kremplsetzer|de}}“.{{sfn|Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz|1965|p=12}}

The house, intended to show a different repertory than the court theatre,{{sfn|Hußlein|2015}} met with financial problems, under frequently changing directors. It had to be sold in March 1870, went first to the former director Friedrich Engelken, shortly thereafter to the architect and a partner, who bought it for the king, who acquired it officially in May 1870. It was reopened on 1 October 1870, directed by [[Hermann von Schmid]].{{sfn|Busse|1924|pp=19–21}} In 1873, Ludwig II granted it the name "Königliches Theater am Gärtnerplatz" (Royal theatre at the Gärtnerplatz).{{sfn|Munich|2018}} From 1877,  {{ill|Karl von Perfall|de}} directed the house and also the Hoftheater. The 1878/79 season was especially splendid but resulted in a large deficit. Perfall therefore focused on the Hoftheater, and was succeeded by Georg Lang. The theatre dropped the royal emblem and was called "Theater am Gärtnerplatz".{{sfn|Busse|1924|pp=29–30}}

In 1913, the house was rebuilt by {{ill|Eugen Drollinger|de}}, who designed a new approach by the audience to the tiers, and installed more loges.{{sfn|Busse|1924|pp=325}} During World War I, several charity performances were given for the ''Kriegsfonds'' and social organisations.{{sfn|Busse|1924|p=44}} In 1923, the house was acquired by the {{ill|Wittelsbacher Ausgleichsfonds|de}}.

When the theatre was built, the focus was on [[operetta]], then a new genre.{{sfn|Hußlein|2015}} [[Singspiel]]e, light operas with spoken dialogue in German, were also performed. When the house opened as a royal theatre, [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s ''Salon Pitzelberger'' was played, titled ''Eine musikalische Soirée in der Vorstadt'' (A musical soiree in the suburb). Some operettas received their world premiere, including [[Carl Zeller]]'s ''Die Fornarina'' on 18 October 1979, starring {{ill|Amalie Schönchen|de}}, Agnes Lang-Ratthey, {{ill|Franz Josef Brakl|de}}} and Max Hofpauer. At the end of 1892, a ''Völkerschau'' (People's Show), ''Die Amazonen von Dahomey'', appeared with people from Africa for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=So rassistisch waren die Völkerschauen in München|periodical=|publisher=www.sueddeutsche.de|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/grosser-andrang-abschied-von-cula-1.3746431|accessdate=2017-11-13|last=Marco Wedig|date=2017-11-12|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gärtnerplatzthea.jpg|thumb|The theatre c. 1900]]
From 1899, the theatre played mainly operettas and was regarded as one of the leading houses for the genre in Germany.{{sfn|Busse|1924|pp=32}} [[Fanny zu Reventlow]] was engaged for a short time. [[Magda Schneider]] appeared at the end of the 1920s, complaining that she had to perform up to 48 times a month for a laughable salary ("für eine lächerliche Gage bis zu achtundvierzig mal im Monat auf der Bühne").&lt;ref&gt;Jürgs 2000, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''Possen'' and ''Volksstücke'' were presented until the 1930s, when the [[Nazi regime]] banned performances by Jewish writers, librettists and composers, and demanded that the theatre serve as a venue exclusively for operettas, as the operetta was an excellent means of familiarizing the ordinary citizen with the theater arts ("ausschließlich zur Aufführungsstätte von Operetten, weil… die Operette ein sehr wesentliches Mittel ist, um den Volksgenossen an die Theaterkunst heranzuführen").&lt;ref&gt;Aktionskreis Gärtnerplatztheater, 1979, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giita.jpg|thumb|Program of ''Gitta'', 1942, with Elisabeth Biebl in the title role]]
In April 1937, the state of Bavaria became owner of the theatre.{{sfn|Munich|2018}} Plans to replace it with a new building were not realised, but the house was restored. The reopening of the only state operetta house in Germany on 20 November 1937 presented ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' by Johann Strauss, with [[Adolf Hitler]] in the audience. From 1938, Fritz Fischer was the [[intendant]] and [[Peter Kreuder]] was the music director. Fischer showed a new style, influenced by Berlin [[revue]]s and filmed operettas, with mass scenes, opulent staging and fast action.&lt;ref&gt;''Bayerisches Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz.'' 1965, p. 26 f.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gitta. Eine Fahrt ins Blaue'', a ''Lustspieloperette'' composed by Bernhard Stimmler and Carl Michalski, premiered on 18 May 1942, presenting the new style. ''[[The Merry Widow|Die lustige Witwe]]'' was also played, the declared favourite operetta of Hitler, who attended the theatre frequently.{{sfn|Jungblut|2017}}

On 21 April 1945, the theatre was badly damaged by the last bombing of Munich.{{sfn|Munich|2018}} Shortly after the war, performances were held at a Schornstraße location, and the restored theatre was reopened{{sfn|Munich|2018}} on 19 June 1948, playing ''[[Eine Nacht in Venedig]]'' by Johann Strauss. The Gärtnerplatztheater was able to secure [[Gustaf Gründgens]] to stage, as a guest, Offenbach's ''[[Les brigands|Die Banditen]]'' (The Bandits), first performed on 6 July 1949, with Gründgens playing a major role ("mit intellektuell-komödantischer Bravour").{{sfn|Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz|1965|p=30}} The theatre played mainly popular works, including Millöcker's ''[[Der Bettelstudent]]'', Abraham's ''[[Viktoria und ihr Husar]]'', Kálmán's ''[[Die Csárdásfürstin]]'' with [[Sári Barabás]] in the title role, and ''[[Gräfin Mariza]]'', Zeller's ''[[Der Vogelhändler]]'', and Lehár's ''[[Das Land des Lächelns]]'', with {{ill|Elisabeth Biebl|de|Elisabeth Biebl (Schauspielerin)|lt=Elisabeth Biebl}} as Mi and {{ill|Harry Friedauer|de}} as Gustl. The world premiere of Burkhard's ''[[Das Feuerwerk]]'', staged by [[Erik Charell]] on 16 May 1950, was noticed well beyond Munich.

From 1952 to 1955, {{ill|Rudolf Hartmann|de|Rudolf Hartmann (Regisseur)}}, who also directed the [[Bayerische Staatsoper]], led the theatre.{{sfn|Munich|2018}} He initiated the performance of operas, but with the ensemble of the State Opera.{{sfn|Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz|1965|p=32}} From 1955, the theatre was again independent and officially named Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz,{{sfn|Munich|2018}} led by Willy Duvoisin (1955 to 1958), [[Arno Assmann]] (1959 to 1964), {{ill|Kurt Pscherer|de}} (1964 to 1983), {{ill|Hellmuth Matiasek|de}} (1983 to 1996), {{ill|Klaus Schultz|de}} (1996 to 2007), {{ill|Ulrich Peters (director)|de|Ulrich Peters|lt=Ulrich Peters}} (2007 to 2012) and {{ill|Josef Ernst Köpplinger|de}} (since 2012).{{sfn|Munich|2018}} The chief conductor is [[Anthony Bramall]] (since 2017), and the director of dance is Karl Alfred Schreiner (since 2012).{{sfn|Munich|2018}}

[[File:München Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz innen.jpg|thumb|Interior in 2008]]
In 1955, the first musical was performed at the Gärtnerplatz, the German premiere of Harold Rome's ''[[Fanny (musical)|Fanny]]'',{{sfn|Jansen|2012|pp=21–22}}{{sfn|Siedhoff|1990}} with {{ill|Christine Görner|de}} and [[Trude Hesterberg]] in leading roles. It was followed a year later by Cole Porter's ''[[Kiss Me, Kate (musical)|Kiss Me, Kate]]'' with [[Johannes Heesters]].{{sfn|Siedhoff|1990}} Loewe's ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' was performed in 1984, staged by [[August Everding]] and with [[Cornelia Froboess]] as Eliza Doolittle.{{sfn|VDOper|2018}} In 1957, the theatre showed the first performance in Munich of Stravinsky's opera ''[[The Rake's Progress]]''.{{sfn|Ganz München|2018}} World premieres of operas included {{ill|Paul Engel (composer)|de|Paul Engel|lt=Paul Engel}}'s ''Daniel'' in 1994,{{sfn|Kutsch|Riemens|2004|p=1577}}, [[Avet Terterian]]'s ''Das Beben'' in 2003,{{sfn|Kuhn|2003}} and {{ill|Wilfried Hiller|de}} ''Der Flaschengeist'' in 2014,{{sfn|Braunmüller|2014}} among others.&lt;!-- and Johann Maria Staud. --&gt;

The theatre was closed in 2012 for extensive restoration.{{sfn|Munich|2018}}{{sfn|Jungblut|2017}} It was reopened on 15 October 2017 with a gala performance followed by a new production of ''Die lustige Witwe'' on 19 October.{{sfn|Jungblut|2017}}{{sfn|Tholl|2017}}

[[File:Falls are the fifth most common event leading to an occupational fatality for oil and gas extraction workers.jpg|thumb|Worker hanging strapped into a safety harness during a fall rescue drill]]
'''Suspension trauma''' ''(Syn. "orthostatic shock while suspended")'', also known as '''harness hang syndrome (HHS)''', '''suspension syndrome''', or '''[[orthostatic intolerance]]''', is an effect which occurs when the human body is held upright without any movement for a period of time. If the person is strapped into a harness or tied to an upright object they will eventually suffer the [[central ischaemic response]] (commonly known as [[fainting]]).  Fainting while remaining vertical increases the risk of death from [[cerebral hypoxia]].&lt;ref&gt;Seddon P.: ''Harness suspension: review and evaluation of existing information''. In: Health and Safety Executive - CONTRACT RESEARCH REPORT 451/2002, page 3, [http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/crr_pdf/2002/crr02451.pdf hier online]&lt;/ref&gt; Since there is no evidence that these effects are specifically due to trauma, or caused by the harness itself, climbing medicine authorities have argued against the terminology of suspension trauma or harness hang syndrome and instead termed this simply "suspension syndrome". &lt;ref&gt;Hawkins SC, Simon RB, Beissinger JP, Simon D. Vertical Aid: Essential Wilderness Medicine for Climbers, Trekkers, and Mountaineers. New York: The Countryman Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

People at risk of suspension trauma include people using industrial harnesses ([[fall arrest]] systems, [[abseiling]] systems, [[confined space]] systems), people using harnesses for sporting purposes ([[caving]], [[climbing]], [[parachuting]], etc.), [[stunt]] performers, circus performers, and occupations that require the use of harnesses and suspension systems in general. Suspension shock can also occur in medical environments, for similar reasons.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Cause==
The most common cause is accidents in which the person remains motionless suspended in a harness for longer periods of time. Motionlessness may have several causes including fatigue, hypoglycemia, hypothermia or traumatic brain injury.

==Symptoms==
Onset of symptoms may be after just a few minutes, but usually occurs after at least 20 minutes of free hanging. Typical symptoms are pallor, sweating, shortness of breath, blurred vision, dizziness, nausea, hypotension and numbness of the legs. Eventually it leads to [[fainting]], which may result in death due to oxygen deprivation of the brain.

==Treatment==
If someone is stranded in a harness, but is not unconscious or injured, and has something to kick against or stand on (such as a rock ledge or caving leg-loops) it is helpful for them to use their leg muscles by pushing against it every so often, to keep the blood pumping back to the torso. If the person is stranded in mid-air or is exhausted, then keeping the legs moving can be both beneficial and rather dangerous. On the one hand, exercising the leg muscles will keep the blood returning to the torso, but on the other hand, as the movements become weaker the leg muscles will continue to demand blood yet they will become much less effective at returning it to the body, and the moment the victim ceases moving their legs, the blood will immediately start to pool. "Pedaling an imaginary bicycle" should only be used as a last-ditch effort to prolong consciousness, because as soon as the "pedaling" stops, fainting will shortly follow. If it is impossible to rescue someone immediately, then it is necessary to raise their legs to a sitting position, which can be done with a loop of rigging tape behind the knees or specialized equipment from a rescue kit.

When workers are suspended in their safety harnesses for long periods, they may suffer from blood pooling in the lower body. This can lead to suspension trauma. Once a worker is back on the ground after a fall has been arrested on a fall protection system, a worker should be placed in the “W” position. The “W” position is where a worker sits upright on the ground with their back/chest straight and their legs bent so that their knees are in line with the bottom of their chin.  For added stability, make sure that the worker’s feet stay flat on the ground. In this position, a KED board can still be used if there are any potential spinal injuries and a worker needs stabilization before transport.

Once the worker is in this position, they will need to stay in that position for at least 30 minutes. Try to leave the worker in this position until their symptoms begin to subside. The time in the “W” position will allow the pooled blood from the legs to be slowly re-introduced back into the body. By slowing the rate at which the pooled blood reaches different organs, you are giving the body more of an opportunity to filter the pooled blood and maintain internal homeostasis. http://www.rigidlifelines.com/blog/entry/suspension-traumasymptoms-and-treatment

==Prevention==
Prevention of suspension trauma is preferable to dealing with its consequences. Specific recommendations for individuals doing technical ropework are to avoid exhausting themselves so much that they end up without the energy to keep moving, and making sure everyone in a group is trained in single rope rescue techniques, especially the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-ht7HgQZkQ "single rope pickoff"], a rather difficult technical maneuver that must be practiced frequently for smooth performance.

 |quote= the São Paulo Fashion Week - Latin America's pre-eminent fashion event - has imposed quotas requiring at least 10 percent of the models to be black or indigenous. The measure was brought in after intense pressure from anti-racism groups and Brazilian prosecutors who blasted the SPFW's longstanding bias towards white models.

'''''The Astronaut Wives Club''''' is an [[United States|American]] period drama television series developed by [[Stephanie Savage]] for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. It is based on [[Lily Koppel]]'s [[The Astronaut Wives Club (book)|book of the same name]].&lt;ref name=ord/&gt; The series tells the story of the wives of the [[Mercury Seven]]—America's first group of [[astronauts]]. Actresses [[Dominique McElligott]], [[Yvonne Strahovski]], [[JoAnna Garcia|Joanna García Swisher]], [[Erin Cummings]], [[Azure Parsons]], [[Zoe Boyle]], and [[Odette Annable]] play the roles of the astronauts' wives.

''The Astronaut Wives Club'' premiered on June 18, 2015.&lt;ref name="Deadline Hollywood"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/04/astronaut-wives-club-premiere-date-summer-abc-1201412805/|title=ABC’s ‘Astronaut Wives Club’ Gets Summer Premiere Date|date=April 20, 2015|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the completion of its run, the series' developer noted the series had been planned as a miniseries, telling a complete story.&lt;ref name="Astronaut Canceled"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-astronaut-wives-club-cancelled-by-abc-no-season-two-37828/|title='The Astronaut Wives Club' Cancelled by ABC; No Season Two|work=TV Series Finale|date=August 23, 2015|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, co-creator Stephanie Savage revealed in an interview with Variety that the producers were interested in making the series an anthology in case it gained a renewal for a second season. Possible seasons would have featured wives of men in the 1920s, wives of World War II soldiers, wives of men who work on Wall Street, and wives of men in the 1980s, among other possible scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/astronaut-wives-club-finale-stephanie-savage-1201572669/|title=‘Astronaut Wives Club’ Finale: Stephanie Savage Prepares for ABC Drama’s Final Descent|last=Friedlander|first=Whitney|date=2015-08-20|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The critical consensus there reads: "''The Astronaut Wives'' relies on poorly paced storylines and clichéd characters, both used in service of a fact-based narrative that would have been better served in a more serious context."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the-astronaut-wives-club/s01/ |title=The Astronaut Wives Club: Season 1 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour''' was the fifth [[concert tour]] by American singer [[Beyoncé]]. Announced in February 2013 with initial dates in Europe and North America, the tour contained seven legs and 132 shows. It began in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] on April 15, 2013 and concluded in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] on March 27, 2014. Its title is a reference to her marriage with American rapper [[Jay-Z|Shawn "Jay-Z" Carter]], who made multiple guest appearances throughout the tour.

The tour featured royal themes with the singer emulating different queens through her fashion for which she collaborated with numerous designers and fashion houses. The [[set list]] of the shows in 2013 included songs from all four [[studio albums]] of Beyoncé's solo career. After the release of her [[Beyoncé (album)|eponymous fifth studio album]], the 2014 shows were changed to incorporate tracks from the album. The tour was lauded by [[music journalism|music critics]] who praised Beyoncé for her energetic performances, dancing and vocal abilities.

Following the announcement of the tour, all the tickets made available for the shows sold out, which prompted more dates to be added to the itinerary. The tour grossed $188.6 million in 2013 and the 2014 shows grossed $41.1 million, bringing the tour's total gross revenue to $229.7 million. This made The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour the highest-grossing female and solo tour of 2013. Performances of numerous songs from the tour were broadcast and behind-the-scenes footage was released.

[[File:Jay-Z Beyonce.jpg|thumbnail|left|180px|Beyoncé's husband [[Jay-Z]] (real name, Shawn Carter), served as an inspiration for the title of the tour.]]
During a press conference for [[Super Bowl XLVII]] on January 31, 2013, Beyoncé revealed that she would make an announcement after her performance at the [[Super Bowl XLVII halftime show|halftime show]] and added that "fans should just stay tuned to see".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a455638/beyonce-to-make-tour-announcement-after-super-bowl.html|title=Beyoncé to make tour announcement after Super Bowl|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Sam|last=Rigby|date=February 1, 2013|accessdate=February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyoncé announced the tour and its name after her performance the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show on February 3. The tour's title refers to her marriage with [[Jay-Z|Shawn 'Jay-Z' Carter]]. However, the official poster of the tour with the name written on it was leaked on the ticket's website [[Live Nation (events promoter)|Live Nation]] prior to the official announcement.&lt;ref name="announcement"&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald|first=David|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1537597/beyonces-world-tour-the-mrs-carter-show |title=Beyoncé's World Tour: The Mrs. Carter Show?|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=February 1, 2013|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows Beyoncé wearing a Victorian golden royal top and a crown, referencing [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2013/feb/04/beyonce-mrs-carter-show|title=Beyoncé and the Mrs Carter Show|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 4, 2013|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosie Swash of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described it as a "visual stamp of authority".&lt;ref name="rossie"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2013/feb/05/beyonce-calling-herself-mrs-carter|title=Why is Beyoncé calling herself Mrs Carter?|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Rosie|last=Swash|date=February 5, 2013|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the tour's name, initial dates in Europe and North America were announced, and later more were added in Latin America, Australia, and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Europe and North America dates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2013/02/03/beyonce-announces-the-mrs-carter-show-world-tour-dates|title=Beyoncé Announces 'The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour' Dates and promotes her fifth album yet to be released|work=[[Rap-Up]]|date=February 3, 2013|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the announcement of the tour's title, Beyoncé was criticized by several critics and [[feminist]]s alike for entitling it after her husband's name as she has been regarded as a feminist.&lt;ref name="rossie" /&gt; Questions were raised about how Beyoncé agreed to be known as a bride of another celebrity person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/02/04/beyonc_s_mrs_carter_show_world_tour_why_use_her_married_name.html|title=Who Run the World?

It comes from knowing my purpose and really meeting myself once I saw my child. I was like, 'OK, this is what you were born to do'. The purpose of my body became completely different."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1704878/beyonce-feminist-vogue-uk.jhtml|title=Beyonce Considers Herself A 'Modern-Day Feminist'|publisher=[[MTV News]]|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|date=April 3, 2013|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the second European leg was announced on December 11, 2013, a new poster was revealed and used for the promotion of all the newly added shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a537382/beyonce-announces-uk-ireland-tour-dates-for-2014.html#~oGXxO8rwWdv2ky|title=Beyoncé announces UK, Ireland tour dates for 2014|work=Digital Spy|first=Greg|last=Laing|date=December 11, 2013|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concert at [[The O2 Arena|The O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Arena]] in London was announced on February 3, along with a short advertisement for the tour; an extended version of the clip appeared in late February. It shows Beyoncé dressed with a golden corset and a royal gown with jewels. She is seen walking into a dance hall in [[slow-motion]] with several servants and a DJ, dressed as a [[jester]] tries to distract her. The end of the advertisement shows [[black-and-white]] snippets of behind-the-scenes footage of the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalfm.com/artists/beyonce-knowles/news/the-mrs-carter-show-world-tour-extended-trailer/|title=Beyonce Stars In New Extended Trailer For 'The Mrs Carter Show' World Tour – Video|publisher=Capital FM|date=February 25, 2013|accessdate=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="e"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eonline.com/news/390755/beyonc-s-mrs-carter-show-tour-extended-teaser-queen-bey-is-royally-fierce-in-majestic-getup-watch-now|title=Beyoncé's "Mrs. Carter Show Tour" Extended Teaser: Queen Bey Is Royally Fierce in Majestic Getup—Watch Now!|publisher=[[E!]]|first=Alexis|last=L.

Inspired by the tour, Beyoncé stated that the fragrance was meant to "give them [fans] a special remembrance of this tour and... reflect the power, passion and playfulness I put into my performances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyonceparfums.com/heat-the-mrs-carter-show-world-tour|title=Heat The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour|publisher=Beyonceparfums.com|accessdate=June 13, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616054435/http://www.beyonceparfums.com/heat-the-mrs-carter-show-world-tour|archivedate=June 16, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 24, 2013, it was announced by Beyoncé's publicist that all photographers except Beyoncé's personal photographer Frank Micelotta, were banned from the tour stating that "no photo credentials" will be present. The ban was interpreted as a reaction to the "unflattering" pictures from Beyoncé's Super Bowl XLVII halftime performance showing her "jubilant exertions", that appeared on websites such as [[Gawker]] and [[BuzzFeed]]. The pictures were not removed even after her publicist Yvette Noel-Schure asked the websites through an e-mail to change their articles, using "some better photos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/24/beyonce-bans-photographers-mrs-carter|title=Beyoncé bans press photographers from Mrs Carter world tour|work=The Guardian|date=April 24, 2013|first=Sean|last=Michaels|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 13, 2013, the general counsel of the [[National Press Photographers Association]] (NPPA) Mickey H. Osterreicher, wrote a letter to Noel-Schure on behalf of 19 other organizations requesting from him to "immediately revise your guidelines to restore photo credentialing" for the rest of the tour in Europe and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fuse.tv/2013/05/beyonce-mrs-carter-show-world-tour-photo-ban|title=Press Photographers to Beyonce: You Don't Run the World|publisher=[[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]]|first=Nicole|last=James|date=May 16, 2013|accessdate=July 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the tour, the singer took part in "Miss A Meal", a food-donation campaign and supported the charity [[Goodwill Industries|Goodwill]] during her tour, where fans were asked to bring food, clothes and household goods at the stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essence.com/2013/04/15/beyonc%C3%A9-teams-goodwill-new-tour/|title=Beyoncé Teams Up with Goodwill on New Tour|work=[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]|first=Derrick|last=Bryson Taylor|date=April 15, 2013|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the tour, an auction for the campaign was held by Beyoncé and her mother, [[Tina Knowles]] on the website [[Charitybuzz]] in which the auction value was $25,000. The winner got a chance to work behind the scenes of Beyoncé's concert in Los Angeles and assist Knowles in the wardrobe department, got a VIP ticket for the concert and had a personal meeting with the singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/music/Beyonce-auctions-tour-experience-for-25000.html|title=Beyoncé auctions tour experience for $25,000|publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]]|first=Jennifer|last=Nguyen|date=June 5, 2013|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight hundred dancers auditioned to be included in Beyoncé's performance at the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and a selected group of them, consisting only of females, were chosen for the performance as well as for the tour.&lt;ref name="vibe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/photo-gallery/10-things-you-need-know-about-beyonce-mrs-carter-show-tour/?page=5|title=10 Things You Need To Know About Beyoncé's 'The Mrs. Carter Show' Tour|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|first=Chris|last=Yuscavage|date=April 17, 2013|page=5 and 6|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; French dancing duo [[Les Twins]] also accompanied Beyoncé on stage performing [[street dance]]s.

Beyoncé's makeup for the tour focused on trying to emulate cosmic stars with the underlying themes based on the [[stratosphere]].

The performances of the songs that had already been performed during the 2013 shows remained the same; however some of them were shortened and mixed together. Many new songs from the singer's fifth album were added to the set list with a specific staging and theme.

== Critical reception ==

Mike Wass from the website [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] called the show a "concert extravaganza in the style of [[Michael Jackson]] or [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]" praising the fact that the singer made a progress in the production values compared with her previous performances, mostly due to the expensive and high-quality visual projections which "create atmosphere and add another layer to the production".&lt;ref name="wass" /&gt; He further praised the singer's "extraordinary talent" during the performances hailing her as "the greatest entertainer of her generation" after seeing the show which showcased "an icon at top of her game".&lt;ref name="wass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7467592/beyonce-mrs-carter-show-live-review|title=Beyonce Raises The Bar At Staples Center: The Mrs. Carter Show Reviewed|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|first=Mike|last=Wass|date=June 29, 2013|accessdate=June 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiffany Poole from ''[[The Oklahoman]]'' praised the fashion, video backdrops and "some of the most impersonated dance moves on YouTube" concluding, "To say that Beyoncé puts on a good show would be grossly understated."&lt;ref name="ok"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/concert-review-beyonce-brings-her-mrs.-carter-show-to-oklahoma-city/article/3859755|title=Concert review: Beyoncé brings her Mrs. Carter Show to Oklahoma City|work=[[The Oklahoman]]|date=July 6, 2013|accessdate=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Billboard'' writer Gail Mitchell hailed the concert as a "musical and visual extravaganza" complete with a kaleidoscope of colorful imagery and dancing, which according to him enhanced the music complete with the singer's strong vocals, rather than overshadowing it. He concluded that the tour claimed "the multi-talented artist's intent to join the rarefied ranks of ultimate entertainer".&lt;ref name="billlaunch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1568692/beyonce-shines-on-us-tour-launch-in-la-live-review|title=Beyoncé Shines On U.S. Tour Launch In L.A.: Live Review|work=Billboard|first=Gail|last=Mitchell|date=June 29, 2013|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Hasted of ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote that the tour followed the stadium trends containing "big-budget movie clips and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]] dance moves, with platoons of backing singers and dancers acting as extras" further hailing it as a "[[Cecil B. DeMille]] spectacle". He finished his reviews by concluding, "what makes this show's largely enervating juggernaut breathe is Beyoncé's tireless physical effort. She has created a literal body of work".&lt;ref name="theindependent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/gig-review-behold-beyonc-the-cybernetic-goddess-of-rb-8590792.html|title=Gig review: Behold Beyoncé, the cybernetic goddess of R&amp;B|work=[[The Independent]]|first=Nick|last=Hasted|date=April 26, 2013|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Alexis Petridis]] of ''The Guardian'' who compared the singer's performance with [[Tina Turner]] praised the show's "bombastic" opening and wrote that "there's something powerful and relentless" about it. He concluded "while onstage Beyoncé feels weirdly unassailable".&lt;ref name="guardreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/27/beyonce-mrs-carter-review|title=Beyoncé – review|work=The Guardian|date=April 27, 2013|first=Alexis|last=Petridis|authorlink=Alexis Petridis|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mikael Wood of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' noted, "What left the deepest impression was something far more elemental: Beyoncé's ability to make self-aggrandizement seem like an expression of humility... [Her] ambition seemed in proportion with her fans' expectations; she came by the sense of scale honestly."&lt;ref name="latimesrev" /&gt; ''The Observer''{{'}}s Kitty Empire highlighted the art direction of the show as "nothing short of breathtaking, making awesome and repeated use of silhouette, of great white blocks of video screens, of live dancers interacting with video". She praised the singer's "fierce" tireless dancing and concluded, "But for all the hauteur here, in couture and bearing, Beyoncé delivers genuine warmth at close range."&lt;ref name="empire" /&gt; Bernadette McNulty from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' found "air of an ancient goddess worship ceremony... [and] of an expensive revue show" in the concert. Although she felt that the choreographies often outshined the music, McNulty concluded: "Yet Beyonce was never less than compelling to watch, and often blistering in her vocal attack".&lt;ref name="telegraf" /&gt;

Philip Matusavage of [[musicOMH]] praised Beyoncé's abilities to perform live, calling her "insanely talented" and considered the performance at the B-stage a show highlight; however he commented that the production values of the show, consisting solely of a video screen were "relatively low-key" compared to other pop arena concerts. Matusavage further criticized the repetition of the songs and dance routines which had been previously performed during the singer's other concerts as the tour's "most notable problem".&lt;ref name="OMH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/reviews/live/beyonce-o2-arena-london|title=Beyoncé – O2 Arena, London – Live reviews|work=[[musicOMH]]|first=Philip|last=Matusavage|date=May 4, 2013|accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shirley Halperin of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' felt that the singer "tore through her... set with the ferocity of a grown woman who has something to prove" and felt that she tried "her damnedest to win the crowd over with an equal dose of sex appeal and good old-fashioned hyping" further showcasing "unequaled showmanship and those killer vocals" which placed her at the top of R&amp;B music.&lt;ref name="hollywood" /&gt; However Halperin criticized the show's set list mainly due to the majority of the songs from the album ''4'', writing, "Bey sounded terrific on all, of course, but with a... ready-to-party audience angling to groove in the aisles, rather than sway with their hands to the heavens, overall it missed the mark."&lt;ref name="hollywood" /&gt; [[Digital Spy]]'s Robert Copsey praised the high-energy nature of the show with vigorous dancing and "blistering" pace but felt that there was a lack of hits performed in the show's first half.&lt;ref name="spy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a477446/beyonces-mrs-carter-show-o2-arena-london-live-review.html|title=Beyoncé's 'Mrs Carter Show', O2 Arena London – Live review|work=Digital Spy|first=Robert|last=Copsey|date=April 30, 2013|accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''NME'' editor Emily Mackay echoed his statements giving a mixed review for the tour, further criticizing the lack of hits in the set list and adding that only a "paucity of material" was incorporated in the set. She further dismissed the placement of interlude films in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/beyonce/14407|title=Live Reviews –  Beyoncé|work=NME|first=Emily|last=Mackay|date=April 29, 2013|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A negative review came from ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]''{{'}} Jim Harrington who called the tour "flawed", criticized its set list consisting of "plenty of filler[s]" and the many dissipating costume changes she went through for the show. He further noted that the singer looked and sounded well but blamed the way the show and the production were choreographed.&lt;ref name="flawed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/music/ci_23590302/review-beyonce-delivers-flawed-show|title=Review: Beyoncé delivers flawed show|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|first=Jim|last=Harrington|date=July 3, 2013|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Beyonce Crazy in love 2013.jpg|thumbnail|right|Beyoncé and her background dancers performing a choreography during "Crazy in Love"]]
The revamped show in 2014 received acclaim by critics. Isabel Mohan from ''The Daily Telegraph'' acclaimed the revamped show praising the singer's sex appeal and noted that although the set included many new songs, the singer "remained strikingly composed and confident throughout a show which proved her talent, charisma and awe-inspiring thighs".&lt;ref name="2014tel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/live-music-reviews/10651237/Beyonce-Glasgow-SSE-Hydro-review.html|title=Beyoncé, Glasgow SSE Hydro, review|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Isabel|last=Mohan|date=February 20, 2014|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sidney Madden who praised the upgraded set list further commended the show's fashion.&lt;ref name="mtv2014" /&gt; Digital Spy's Robert Copsey felt that the show's set list was better than the original one describing the tour as "wall-to-wall amazing Beyoncé". He concluded in his review, "The relentless pace, ever-changing visuals and sheer amount of songs crammed into the set is a lot to take in, let alone the fact that Beyoncé delivers the entire thing with power yet impeccable ease. When it comes to putting on a show of this calibre, these days she's really only competing with herself."&lt;ref name="biggerisbetter" /&gt; ''The Observer''{{'}}s Kitty Empire praised the singer's ranuchiness during the tour different from the other performers and concluded by writing, "There is no question as to Beyoncé's own powers. She can stop and start her all-female band... with a click of her fingers, and keep climbing octaves until you think her lungs are about to jump out of her chest. She sings (with a range that only gets wider and deeper with every tour) and dances (flawlessly) for more than one and a half hours."&lt;ref name="pacman" /&gt; David Pollock of ''The Independent'' felt that, "this near two-hour epic is a ferocious distillation of musical styles old and new and a stunning declaration of intent that Knowles intends to be recognised as the defining pop artist of her era. It was, at the very least, one of the hardest working shows likely to be witnessed on a stage this year, and with barely a drop of minutely-choreographed sweat to be seen."&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/beyonce-mrs-carter-show-world-tour-review-9142788.html|title=Beyonce, Mrs Carter Show World Tour, review|work=The Independent|first=David|last=Pollock|date=February 21, 2014|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewer Marvin J.

The '''Théâtre des Variétés-Amusantes''' was a theatre in Paris.

==History==
In 1778, Louis Lécluse (or Lécluze), a former actor at the [[Théâtre national de l'Opéra-Comique|Opéra-Comique]] turned dentist, opened a theatre at [[théâtre de la foire|foire Saint-Laurent]], which shortly afterwards he transferred to the [[boulevard du Temple]], at the corner of rue de Lancry and rue de Bondy (now rue René-Boulanger, [[Paris Xe arrondissement|Xe arrondissement]]).  

Unable to bear the hostility this new enterprise generated, Lécluse ceded his theatre and its company to three former dancers of the [[Opéra national de Paris|Opéra]] – Fierville fils, [[François Duval (dancer)|Malter]] and [[Hamoir (dancer)|Hamoir]] – as well as the financier Lemercier.  The theatre opened on 12 April 1779 and it attracted large audiences by its varied and well-performed repertoire.  [[Dorvigny]] wrote several plays for it, including ''Janot ou les Battus paient l'amende'' (11 June 1779), which was a great success.

In 1784, the theatre's directors had their privilege revoked by a Conseil d'État decree, in favour of Gaillard and Dorfeuille, after a complaint from the [[Opéra national de Paris|Académie royale de Musique]].  The new directors moved the theatre to the [[Palais-Royal]] and opened their new building on 1 January 1785, under the name '''Variétés du Palais-Royal'''.  Its fare until that date had been farces, which they replaced with comedies, welcoming [[Jacques Marie Boutet|Monvel]] and [[Julie Candeille]], then [[François-Joseph Talma|Talma]], [[Dugazon]] and [[Rose Vestris|Mme Vestris]].  From then on the theatre was renamed the ''Théâtre-Français de la rue Richelieu'', then the ''[[Comédie-Française|Théâtre de la République]]''.

The '''Valley Forge Pilgrimage and Encampment''' is the oldest annual [[Scouting]] event in the [[World]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} It was first held on February 22, 1913 ([[George Washington]]'s 181st birthday), and has been held every year since.&lt;ref name="NPS1"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =  | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/vafo/treese/treese8.htm | title = CHAPTER EIGHT: New Uses for an Old Story | work = | publisher = Valley Forge National Historic Park | accessdate = 2006-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is hosted by the [[Cradle of Liberty Council]] and commemorates the soldiers of the [[Continental Army]] who braved the winter of 1777-78 at [[Valley Forge]]. Each year more than 2,000 brave the winter chill of the [[Delaware Valley]] to participate.

==History==
[[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) was only three years old, and was sweeping the country when approximately 300 Scouts from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and suburban [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]] and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery Counties]] took part in the first pilgrimage.&lt;ref name="Scouting Mag"&gt;{{cite web | last =Peterson | first =Robert | authorlink = | coauthors = |date=December 2003  | url = http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0311/a-test.html#sbara | title = Scouting's Oldest Annual Event | format = | work = Scouting Magazine| publisher = Boy Scouts of America| accessdate = 2006-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Valley Forge cabin.jpg|thumb|Valley Forge Cabin]]
Typical attendance ranged from 125 to 275 Scouts and leaders until the [[Great Depression]]. The event has been held every year, even during the Depression and [[World War II]], though the event was then held at a reduced scale. In the early years, Scouts traveled to Valley Forge by train and foot, arriving at the [[Valley Forge Train Station]].

The event was organized by an [[Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania|Episcopal]] [[Anglican ministry|priest]], Rev. Dr. [[W. Herbert Burk]] of [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]].&lt;ref name="NPS2"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =  | url = https://www.nps.gov/vafo/learn/historyculture/treese5.htm | title = CHAPTER FIVE: The Churches at Valley Forge | work = | publisher = Valley Forge National Historic Park | accessdate = 2006-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burk had also been instrumental in building the [[Washington Memorial Chapel]] at Valley Forge. Burk continued to be involved in the planning for the annual pilgrimage for the next two decades. The term "pilgrimage" was chosen because every participating troop lined up in formation with their flags and paraded to the chapel for the  [[memorial]] service for George Washington.

The first ''official'' overnight Valley Forge Encampment in connection with a pilgrimage was in 1948. Prior to that there were many unofficial campouts on the site, as the area was relatively rural and unpopulated. [[John Pershing|General John Pershing]] and [[Daniel Carter Beard]] have both been featured guests. The biggest crowd was at the 1932 pilgrimage, which marked Washington's 200th birthday. An estimated 9,000 Boy Scouts from Pennsylvania and neighboring states, plus 10,000 adults and children, were on hand.&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =  | url = http://www.countypressonline.com | title = Pilgrimage  | format = | work = | publisher = Springfield (Pa.)

The event itself is divided into two parts: the Encampment, in which Scouts camp from Friday through Sunday on the [[Presidents' Day (United States)|Presidents' Day]] weekend, and the Pilgrimage which is all day Saturday. During the Pilgrimage, participants move around the [[Valley Forge National Historical Park|Valley Forge NHP]] to hear volunteer interpreters from the [[National Park Service]] tell how the Continentals lived. Replicas of the original huts provide a glimpse of daily life. Conditions during the winter were poor, so the stories are also told how more than 2,000 soldiers died from [[typhus]], [[dysentery]], [[typhoid]] and [[pneumonia]].

The '''23rd World Youth Day''' was a Catholic youth festival that started on 15 July and continued until 20 July 2008 in Sydney, Australia. It was the first [[World Youth Day]] held in Australia and the first World Youth Day in Oceania. This meeting was decided by [[Pope Benedict XVI]], during the [[World Youth Day 2005|Cologne World Youth Day of 2005]]. The theme was "''You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you''" (from [[Acts]] 1:8).

About 500,000 young people from 200 countries attended during the week, and more than 1,000,000 came for the weekend. They were joined by about 600 bishops and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], as well as by 6,600 reporters.

==Schedule of events==
The festivals of WYD began on 1 July 2007, when a large 3.8-meter-high wooden cross and a large 15-kilogram [[icon]] of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] arrived in Sydney to travel around the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=misSC60t9Vw WYD Cross &amp; Icon Arrival and The Western Deanery]&lt;/ref&gt; The relay-style event, known as the Journey of the Cross and Icon (or JCI for short) saw the cross and icon go on a pilgrimage around the [[diocese]]s of Australia, engaging with a variety of Catholic parishes and communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ceosyd.catholic.edu.au/cms/Jahia/site/reonline/pid/2646 Arrival of the Cross and Icon signal countdown to Australia's World Youth Day]&lt;/ref&gt;

The WYD Cross was entrusted to the youth of the world by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1984 as a sign of peace and hope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xt3.com/library/view.php?id=792 The Cross, A Gift from John Paul II to the World’s Youth – Xt3 Library]&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope told the young people of the world to take it around the world as "a symbol of Christ's love for humanity". In 2004, Pope John Paul II commissioned the large icon of the Virgin Mary to accompany the cross' pilgrimage. It is a symbol intended to represent Mary's maternal love for young people. From the announcement of the host World Youth Day, the cross and icon travel ceremonially around the world similar to the [[Olympic torch relay]].

In the week preceding the main event, many young Catholic pilgrims spent time in different parts of Australia and New Zealand {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, staying with a local parish as part of the ''Days in the Dioceses''. After their stay, they travelled to Sydney for the Opening [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of the week-long main event.

[[File:20080712 Sydney World Youth day Station of the Cross rhrsl.jpg|thumb|Rehearsal for Stations of the Cross on 12 July near the Sydney Opera House]]
The Pope arrived at Sydney on 13 July at [[Richmond Air Force Base]] in North Western Sydney on a special [[Alitalia]] flight. Until 17 July he stayed in the [[Opus Dei]] centre, called [[Kenthurst Study Centre]], 30&amp;nbsp;km from Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opusdei.pl/art.php?p=28875 Opus Dei and WYD2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 July, World Youth Day 2008 began with the Opening Mass, celebrated by [[George Pell|George Cardinal Pell]], the Archbishop of Sydney, at [[Barangaroo, New South Wales|Barangaroo]]. This was followed by a concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wyd2008.org/index.php/en/wyd08_events |title = WYD08 Events |accessdate =18 Jul 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each morning from 15 to 17 July, [[Catechism|Catechists]] were held in approximately 300 locations. Pilgrims received teachings from a Bishop and also celebrated Mass. In the afternoons, pilgrims journeyed into the city and attend the '''Youth Festival''' consisting of a series of art exhibitions, concerts, seminars, and conferences.

On 17 July 2008, 500,000&lt;ref&gt;cf. [http://wyd2008.org/index.php/en/media__1/latest_news/500_million_people_globally_watch_the_stations_of_the_cross_pope_s_busy_meeting_schedule_continues Pope's busy meeting schedule continues]: ''After 500,000 people turned out to welcome him to Sydney yesterday''&lt;/ref&gt; attendees from around the world were present at Barangaroo to welcome Pope Benedict XVI on a day dubbed '''Super Thursday''' by the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=2&amp;ContentID=85297|title=Pope arrives to kick off Super Thursday|date=17 Jul 2008|accessdate=18 Jul 2008|publisher=The West Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope actually arrived on 14 July, but only appeared in public for the first time on the 17th. The event involved the Pope travelling around [[Port Jackson]] in a "boatacade" where pilgrims lined the shores to see him. However, there were many disappointed spectators in places like the Botanic Gardens and Circular Quay who did not actually see the Pope because of where he was sitting on the boat. The [[Sydney Children's Choir]] and Gondwana Voices performed at the event.  The Pope then spoke extensively to the pilgrims and greeted them in five foreign languages. In order to let the pilgrims see him better the Pope was driven around Barangaroo through the crowds in his Popemobile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wyd2008.org/index.php/en/media__1/latest_news/vatican_officials_confirm_pope_benedict_will_visit_mary_mackillop_shrine WYD2008 Confirms Papal visit to MacKillop Shrine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2008/july/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20080717_barangaroo_en.html Papal Address at WYD2008 Arrival]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 July, there was a live re-enactment of the [[Stations of the Cross]] at major city landmarks with an estimated 270,000 participants. Around 500&amp;nbsp;million people around the world followed the stations on television.&lt;ref&gt;cf.

On 19 July, around 235,000 pilgrims embarked on a 10-kilometre pilgrimage walk, beginning at the [[Mary MacKillop|Mary MacKillop Chapel]] in North Sydney, over the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] and across the city to attend an overnight vigil before the Mass at [[Randwick Racecourse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-23274?l=english 235,000 Attend World Youth Day Vigil], Zenit.org from 19 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 250,000 pilgrims slept overnight at Randwick, and about 300,000 to 400,000 participants attended the Final Mass celebrated by Pope Benedict XVI on Sunday 20 July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/400000-expected-for-sydney-papal-mass/2006/10/06/1159641503165.html 400,000 expected for Sydney papal mass ''Sydney Morning Herald'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Benedict continued a tradition of Australian Papal Masses at Randwick Racecourse, following in the footsteps of John Paul II and Paul VI. At the conclusion of the final mass the Pope announced that the 2011 World Youth Day would be held in [[Madrid]], Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=dfd5a6b1-28b6-4b75-a3cd-f2234e984186 Spanish hail Madrid choice for next World Youth Day]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web 2.0===
WYD 2008 was the first World Youth Day to take full advantage of telecommunications, with Pope Benedict sending text messages to the pilgrims during the week. Each pilgrim who registered for WYD had the option of providing a mobile phone number to which the Pontiff's message would be sent at the beginning of each day.

===Food===
Pilgrims were served a traditional Australian menu. Over the six-day event, 3.5&amp;nbsp;million meals were served. To cater for the masses, 210,000 slices of bread, 425,000 chocolate bars, 200,000 meat pies and 300,000 servings of Weet-Bix Crunch were ordered. "We want to provide pilgrims with a good feed and a little bit of an Australian taste," WYD director of services Geoff Morris said; "We have tried to do that by including some of our more iconic items such as [[Tim Tam]]s, [[Weet-Bix]] Crunch, [[Vegemite]], [[lamingtons]] and good old [[baked beans]]". Organisers also held a "Big Aussie BBQ", which saw 200 barbecues lit up simultaneously across Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23830695-5016937,00.html 200,000 meat pies for WYD].

===Souvenirs===
Pilgrims and the public were able to buy 470 different products including papal mementos such as special WYD rosary beads, Pope Benedict XVI baseball caps and rugby jerseys. Sydney's Catholic Archbishop Cardinal George Pell said that the Church was not looking to make a profit.

Any remaining merchandise was given to Catholic charities and surplus clothing was sent overseas to developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;Lam, M. 2008. Merchandise Being Bought Religiously. ''The Daily Telegraph'', 20 July 2008, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attendance==
[[File:World Youth Day 2008 - Sydney, Australia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] wave their country's flag at the 2008 World Youth Day]]
World Youth Day organizers revised the expected number of attendees downwards during the lead-up to the event. In October 2007, the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, George Pell, claimed that "over half a million" people would attend the final mass at Randwick. The World Youth Day site later claimed likely attendance of "up to" half a million. Similarly, the projected number of overseas attendees was 150,000 people in 2006. This was later altered to a projection of "over 125,000" people from overseas.
65,000 visas were granted as of 12 days before the start of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080721191810/http://www.sydney.catholic.org.au/pdf/Transcript.pdf George Pell at the National Press Club]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wyd2008.org/index.php/en/about_wyd08 about WYD08]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncronline.org/mainpage/specialdocuments/Fishertext.htm Interview with Auxiliary Bishop Anthony Fisher of Sydney, Australia] – National Catholic Reporter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/07/03/2293855.htm?section=justin WYD visa numbers below expectations] – ABC News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wyd2008.org/index.php/en/media__1/latest_news/world_youth_day_2008_confirms_international_pilgrim_numbers world youth day 2008 confirms international pilgrim numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 500,000 welcomed the pope to Sydney and 270,000 watched the [[Stations of the Cross]].

"[[Receive the Power]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;VideoID=56420751 Receive the Power Myspace video]&lt;/ref&gt; is an original song written by [[Guy Sebastian]] and Gary Pinto, and chosen in May 2007 as the official anthem for the Roman Catholic Church's [[XXIII World Youth Day]] (WYD08).

"Receive the Power" was played extensively throughout the 6 days of World Youth Day in July 2008, and also in the television coverage which went around the world. [[Guy Sebastian]] performed at the concert after the Opening Mass which officially welcomed Pope Benedict XVI to Australia. Sebastian and [[Paulini Curuenavuli|Paulini]] also performed both the English and international versions at the Final Mass at Randwick Race Course on 20 July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wyd2008.org/index.php/en/media__1/latest_news/news_archives/2008_june_news_archives/aussie_pop_stars_aria_award_winners_and_the_tap_dogs_to_headline_world_youth_day_sydney_2008 Aussie pop stars, ARIA award winners and the Tap Dogs to headline World Youth Day Sydney 2008.

==Indulgence==
The Pope announced that pilgrims at World Youth Day 2008 and those from around the world who pray for the "spiritual goals of this meeting and for its happy outcome" would be able to receive [[indulgences]].  In Roman Catholic teaching an indulgence is believed to erase the temporal punishment (time spent in [[purgatory]]) which results from sin.

Two types of indulgences were available:
* plenary (full) indulgence – for attendees
* partial indulgence – for those who pray&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=13147 Pope grants indulgences for World Youth Day&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies around the World Youth Day==

===Public funding===
Some were concerned regarding the NSW state government's public funding of $129&amp;nbsp;million and the federal government's funding of $55&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/almighty-cost-of-hosting-pilgrims/2008/06/21/1214009167373.html Almighty cost of hosting pilgrims]'' – ''Sydney Morning Herald''&lt;/ref&gt; Some described it as a "[[promotional event]]" for the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nsw.greens.org.au/media-centre/news-releases/world-youth-day-costs-up-benefits-down World Youth Day: costs up, benefits down] – NSW Greens&lt;/ref&gt;

However the Sydney Chamber of Commerce estimated that World Youth Day would generate $230&amp;nbsp;million of economic activity and the NSW state government claimed that it would have a direct economic benefit over $150&amp;nbsp;million. In addition to direct benefits the state government said that the coverage of World Youth Day overseas was worth at least $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="b: Iemma"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/07/22/2310308.htm?section=justin WYD coverage worth $1b: Iemma]&lt;/ref&gt; These gains would offset and exceed the government's expenditure on World Youth Day.

===Use of Randwick Racecourse===
[[File:WYD08 FinalMass.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The Final Mass held at '''[[Randwick Racecourse|Southern Cross Precinct]]''' (named specifically for the event) drew 350,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/07/20/pope.australia.ap/index.html CNN Reports on WYD08]&lt;/ref&gt; pilgrims.]]
The use of the [[Randwick Racecourse]] for the event was criticised and legally challenged by the racing industry in Sydney. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Industry representatives argued that alternative sites, such as the [[Sydney Olympic Park]] at [[Homebush Bay]], were more suitable venues.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} However, the NSW and federal governments and the event organisers insisted that Randwick Racecourse was the only location suitable for an event of such scale. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The World Youth Day committee initially offered to pay an agreed settlement to the racing industry. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} However, after some complaints, the federal and the New South Wales state government stepped in and jointly pledged $42&amp;nbsp;million in compensation to the racing industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24057380-5016672,00.html | title=Despite 400,000 pilgrims, Randwick racecourse is intact | first=Rosie | last=Lewis | date=22 July 2008 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; – more than triple the previously agreed upon amount. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} In exchange, the industry relocated its operations to the [[Warwick Farm Racecourse|Warwick Farm]] and [[Rosehill Gardens Racecourse|Rosehill Gardens]] racecourses, with infrastructure at these sites and at Randwick to be upgraded as part of the compensation package. In addition, the [[Australian Jockey Club]]'s lease at Randwick was to  be extended by 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Racing industry offered payout for Pope | work=[[The West Australian]] | date = 15 November 2007 | url = http://www.thewest.com.au/aapstory.aspx?StoryName=437040}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com.au/mediaandnews/newsarticle.aspx?ID=148 World Youth Day reaches agreement with racing industry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some earlier concerns the final mass left the turf in good condition. The Randwick Project Steering Committee chief Hugh Martin stated that he was "very pleased with the state of the track" and an Australian Jockey Club spokesman noted that the "track seems to have held up well."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===World Youth Day legislation===
The [[Parliament of New South Wales]] passed the ''World Youth Day Act 2006'' especially for the event. The regulations made under this act however had been the source of some controversy, mainly in the operation of various provisions of the ''World Youth Day Regulation 2008'' within hundreds of so-called "declared areas" across Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nswbar.asn.au/circulars/july/wyd_reg2.pdf World Youth Day Amendment Regulation 2008] (NSW Bar Association)&lt;/ref&gt; These areas included over 40 city locations, including popular tourist spots the [[Sydney Opera House]] and the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], as well as at numerous public transport stations and schools.

The most significant and contentious amendments to the regulations were announced by the Deputy Premier [[John Watkins (Australian politician)|John Watkins]] on 25 June 2008 and came into effect on 1 July 2008. People entering or exiting declared areas would have been subject to being searched, including vehicles or baggage, if so requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|repealed_reg|wydr2008290|World Youth Day Regulation 2008|8}} Request to undergo search as condition of entry to World Youth Day declared areas .&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Australian]]'', this may have included either general clothing inspections, partial strip searches, or even arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/thou-shalt-not-annoy-or-trespass--a-hrefhttpwwwsmhcomaupollsnationalformhtmlbpollba/2008/06/30/1214677946009.html Thou shalt not annoy or trespass] ''Sydney Morning Herald''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/nswbills.nsf/0/B9BD72676C89BB3FCA2573A0001D8692?Open&amp;shownotes World Youth Day Amendment Bill 2007] – NSW State Parliament''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23950435-12377,00.html Strip searches okayed for WYD] – The Australian''&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations would have been enforced by police, with the Rural Fire Service and the State Emergency Service having enforcement power over some provisions. These authorisations were especially controversial, as such granted enforcement powers are normally available only to police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=7946 Volunteers refuse WYD powers]&lt;/ref&gt; The new powers also caused concern to those organisations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/national/volunteers-spurn-youth-day-powers-20080703-319r.html Volunteers spurn Youth Day powers]&lt;/ref&gt; which did not consider enforcement to be their role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/07/04/2294420.htm Volunteers reject Youth Day powers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the most contentious of the regulations, a maximum fine of A$5,500 was able to be imposed for causing 'annoyance or inconvenience' to WYD participants. This was challenged in the [[Federal Court of Australia]] on the grounds of violating the implied constitutional freedom of political communication and/or exceeding the regulation making power of the ''World Youth Day Act 2006 (NSW)''. The Full Court agreed with the latter argument, declaring Clause 7(1)(b) regarding the specific prohibition of causing  "annoyance to participants in a World Youth Day event" invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCAFC|130|2008|litigants=Evans v State of New South Wales |courtname=auto |date=18 July 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protest groups===
A number of activist groups protested against the Catholic Church on World Youth Day. Various [[atheist]] and secular groups cooperated to form the NoToPope Coalition for WYD. The coalition rallied against the Church's stances on [[same-sex marriage]], abortion, and [[contraception]]. Additionally, groups representing some victims of sexual abuse protested prior to WYD. On Saturday, the day of the pilgrimage walk, approximately 100 protesters positioned themselves on a street corner to chant slogans and wave banners at the over 200,000 pilgrims walking to Randwick. A strong police presence controlled the protesters.&lt;ref name="protest"/&gt;

Protest organisers had planned to use T-shirts with anti-Catholic slogans such as "Religion harms us by privileging faith over reason", "Badly needed community services were robbed to pay the Pope"&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/sydney-condom-protest-against-pope/2008/06/24/1214073209465.html World Youth Day condom protest against Pope]'' – ''Sydney Morning Herald''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mac.com/anthonyenglund/Sydney_Atheists/WCYD.html World Catholic Youth Day Action]'' – Sydney Atheists&lt;/ref&gt; and "107 Catholic clergy convicted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.sbs.com.au/worldnewsaustralia/child_abuse_victims_protest_outside_nsw_551357 |title = Child abuse victims protest outside NSW – SBS World News Australia |accessdate =18 Jul 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were very few physical confrontations between the pilgrims and protestors, with some initiated by the protestors throwing condoms at the pilgrims. Police arrested one Australian pilgrim for attacking a protestor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livenews.com.au/Articles/2008/07/19/Pilgrim_arrested_for_bashing_a_protestor LIVENEWS.com.au &gt; National &gt; Pilgrim arrested for bashing a protestor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="protest"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world-youth-day/protest-turns-ugly-as-condoms-rile-marcher/2008/07/19/1216163229713.html | title=Protest turns ugly as condoms rile marcher | date=20 July 2008 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Sydney small business owner alleged that he received an anonymous threat against him and his family for producing "annoying" T-shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/worldyouyouthday/faithful-get-annoyed-over-merchandise/2008/07/07/1215282747311.html |title = Faithful get annoyed over merchandise – WorldYouYouthDay – Specials – smh.com.au |accessdate =18 Jul 2008 | date=8 July 2008 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over Bishop Anthony Fisher's statements===
WYD coordinator Bishop Fisher told journalists the latest controversy was detracting from the massive Catholic youth festival underway in Sydney. "I think most of Australia was enjoying, delighting in the beauty and goodness of these young people... rather than dwelling crankily, as a few people are doing, on old wounds."

Anthony and Christine Foster spoke out on the Bishop's comments, labelling them "very insensitive". Their daughters Emma and Katherine were raped by priest Kevin O'Donnell leading to Emma's suicide at the age of 26, while her sister Katherine drank heavily before being left disabled when hit by a drunk driver in 1999. Advocates for Survivors of Child Abuse director Michael Salter was outraged by Bishop Anthony Fisher's comments, saying, "The Catholic Church has a lot to learn about the burden of clergy abuse on the lives of victims, and those who care for them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sbs.com.au/worldnewsaustralia/anger_over_bishop39s_attack_on_cranky_abuse_victims_551961 |title=Anger over bishop's attack on "cranky" abuse victims – SBS World News Australia |accessdate=31 Aug 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080806051331/http://news.sbs.com.au/worldnewsaustralia/anger_over_bishop39s_attack_on_cranky_abuse_victims_551961 |archivedate=6 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop Fisher later said he had been misquoted by media representatives, who, according to him, had been the people he had called "cranky" and not the victims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wentworth-courier.whereilive.com.au/news/story/the-faith-and-conviction-of-bishop-anthony-fisher/ The faith and conviction of Bishop Anthony Fisher – Wentworth Courier, 29 July 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport concerns===
An additional 4,000 train and 3,400 bus services were commissioned for the event. There were 400 road clearways and 300 road closures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24027447-5016672,00.html | title=Sydney's rail, bus and ferries cope with extra 185,000 | first=Lauren | last=Williams | date=16 July 2008 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threats to strike on 17 July  in the heart of the celebrations, made by disgruntled rail workers, were withdrawn following negotiations with the state government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/national/world-youth-day-rail-strike-cancelled-20080708-360t.html Rail Strike Cancelled]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following World Youth Day, the NSW Premier [[Morris Iemma]] gave the transport systems' performance a 10-out-of-10 rating. He stated that special events such as WYD proved that decent public transport was possible and was considering implementing some of the strategies used for the event on an ongoing basis.&lt;ref name="b: Iemma"/&gt; Former Roads and Traffic Authority director Ken Robinson said that the public transport system ran smoothly during World Youth Day due to better coordination between different transport authorities, whilst NSW transport minister John Watkins noted that public transport for the week worked "tremondously well."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24057379-5016672,00.html Morris Iemma to investigate decent public transport always] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803102901/http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24057379-5016672,00.html |date=3 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/07/21/2309226.htm NSW urged to learn from WYD transport success]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apology, meeting with victims and criticisms===
[[File:SaintMarys CathedralSydney.jpg|thumb|St. Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, Australia, the Pope's residence during World Youth Day 2008.]]
On 19 July 2008, in [[St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney|Sydney's St. Mary's Cathedral]], Pope Benedict XVI made a historic full apology for [[child sex abuse]] by priests and clergymen in Australia. Before a congregation of 3,400, he called for compensation and demanded punishment for those guilty of the "evil": "Here I would like to pause to acknowledge the shame which we have all felt as a result of the sexual abuse of minors by some clergy and religious in this country. I am deeply sorry for the pain and suffering the victims have endured and I assure them that, as their pastor, I too share in their suffering." The Pope added: "Victims should receive compassion and care, and those responsible for these evils must be brought to justice. These misdeeds, which constitute so grave a betrayal of trust, deserve unequivocal condemnation. I ask all of you to support and assist your bishops, and to work together with them in combating this evil. It is an urgent priority to promote a safer and more wholesome environment, especially for young people." On 21 July, before flying out of Australia Pope Benedict met with a group of four victims of sexual abuse at St. Mary's Cathedral in Sydney, listened to their stories and celebrated mass with them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24049778-601,00.html ''The Australian'']&lt;/ref&gt; Broken Rites, the  support group representing Australian victims, criticised the meeting as hand-picked: "I'm afraid that what they've done is selected victims who have agreed with what the church's policies are".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4370294.ece  ''The Times'', Pope meets sex abuse victims in secret Sydney mass]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/world/asia/22pope.html?hp nytimes.com, Pope Meets Australian Abuse Victims]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gKSHzEnFg_IjhlGLRKN9EoDNf3jg afp.google.com, Pope meets sex abuse victims as Australia trip ends] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002012415/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gKSHzEnFg_IjhlGLRKN9EoDNf3jg |date=2 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broken Rites said: "Sorry may be a start but we want to see a lot more. We want the victims to be treated fairly, we don't want them to feel that they have been shut out, we don't want them to be re-abused by church authorities." It reported that there were 107 Catholic priests and religious brothers sentenced in Australian courts on sex charges, and that in 2002, Australian bishops had already apologised for past abuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jtGYmNq72j_-TNnXfLbSdMgiTPMQ afp.google.com, Pope apologizes for 'evil' of child sex abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707153812/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jtGYmNq72j_-TNnXfLbSdMgiTPMQ |date=7 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/burningIssues/idUKSYD1805020080719 uk.reuters.com, Pope sorry for Church sexual abuse]&lt;/ref&gt;

The then NSW Premier Morris Iemma said he hoped "it would be a sign of righting the wrongs of the past and of a better future and better treatment by the church of the victims and their families."&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/world/view/20080719-149455/Popes-Australia-sex-abuse-apology-not-enough----critics newsinfo.inquirer.net, Pope's Australia sex abuse apology not enough – critics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729220022/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/world/view/20080719-149455/Popes-Australia-sex-abuse-apology-not-enough----critics |date=29 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departure==
The Pontiff departed from [[Sydney Airport]] on 21 July 2008.

The '''Yellow Vests movement''' ({{lang-fr|Mouvement des gilets jaunes}}, {{IPA-fr|ʒilɛ ʒon|pron}}), also referred to as the '''Yellow Jacket Movement''' in English, is a protest movement which began demonstrations in France on Saturday, 17 November 2018 and subsequently spread to nearby countries (e.g. [[Italy]] ({{lang-it|gilet gialli}}), [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] ({{lang-nl|gele hesjes}})). Galvanized by rising fuel prices, the high [[cost of living]], and claims that a disproportionate burden of the government's tax reforms were falling on the working and middle classes&lt;ref name="Spire" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author = Aline Leclerc | url=https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2018/11/16/gilets-jaunes-radiographie-d-une-colere_5384349_823448.html|title=« Gilets jaunes » : anatomie d’une journée de colère|work=Le Monde.fr|access-date=2018-11-19|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/16/gilet-jaunes-yellow-jackets-protesters-france-standstill|title='Gilets jaunes' protesters threaten to bring France to a standstill|last=Willsher|first=Kim|date=2018-11-16|newspaper=the Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/who-are-france-s-yellow-jacket-protesters-what-do-they-n940016|title=The Champs-Élysées in Paris became a blazing battleground.

The movement has been most visible in [[French cities]], but has had a wider echo because rural areas have been unusually mobilized. The "yellow vest" was chosen as a symbol because all motorists had been required by law&amp;mdash;since 2008&amp;mdash;to have [[high-visibility vests]] in their vehicles when driving. As a result, reflective vests have become widely available, inexpensive, and symbolic.&lt;ref name="Mercury"&gt;{{cite news |author = Associated Press | title=The Yellow Vests: Who they are and why their tax protest is a big deal |url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/20/gilets-jaunes-yellow-vest-gas-tax-protest-france/ |accessdate=21 November 2018 |work=The Mercury News |date=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Diesel===
{{see|Economic history of France#Since 1944}}
Since the 1950s, the French government has subsidized the production of [[diesel engine]]s.  In particular, since 1980, [[Groupe PSA|Peugeot]] has been at the forefront of diesel technology.  VAT taxes being cut for corporate fleets also increased the prevalence of diesel cars in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Diesel : les raisons d'une " exception culturelle " française | date=April 10, 2014 | url = https://www.lesechos.fr/10/04/2014/LesEchos/21666-088-ECH_diesel---les-raisons-d-une---exception-culturelle---francaise.htm | newspaper = Les Echos | language = fr | access-date = December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other non-union protests===
One of the first known demonstrations in France against the taxation of petrol prices dates back to 1933 in [[Lille]]. The movement against tax increases also evokes the "[[poujadism]]" of the 1950s, which mobilized the middle classes and was articulated around a tax revolt.
"Slow-down movements" were also organized in the 1970s. In July [[1992]], such a movement was set up to protest against the introduction of the points-based permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.archives-imagesplus.tv/notices/view/9037#.W-0hg-hKgdU|title=Opération escargot contre le permis à point|website=Archives-imagesplus.tv|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Béatrice Giblin, comparisons between the ''gilets jaunes'' and the [[Bonnets Rouges]]&amp;mdash;who opposed a new eco-tax in 2013&amp;mdash;were inapt because the latter "had been taken in hand by real [[leaders]], such as the mayor of [[Carhaix]], or the great bosses of Brittany" whereas the yellow jackets remained leaderless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Béatrice Giblin | author2=Guillaume Erner | title=Qui sont les gilets jaunes?|url=https://www.franceculture.fr/emissions/linvite-des-matins/qui-sont-les-gilets-jaunes|website=Franceculture.fr|date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Diesel fuel|Diesel]] prices in France have increased by 16% in 2018, with taxes on both [[petrol]] and diesel increasing at the same time and a further tax increase planned in 2019. Those increases made diesel as expensive as petrol.&lt;ref name=CNN1&gt;{{cite news | author1 = Eva Tapiero | author2 = Matthew Robinson | author3 = Laura Smith-Spark | title=French fuel protests leave 1 dead, dozens injured |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/17/europe/macron-france-fuel-protests-intl/ |accessdate=20 November 2018 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[French President|President]] [[Emanuel Macron|Emmanuel Macron]] is bearing the brunt of the protestors' anger for his extension of policies implemented under [[François Hollande]]'s government.&lt;ref name=CNN1/&gt;

==Protests==

The protests began on 17 November 2018, and attracted over 300,000 people across France, with protestors constructing barricades and blocking roads.&lt;ref name=Local1&gt;{{cite news |author = Ben McPartland | title=LATEST: French police dislodge fuel protesters as movement wanes (for now) |url=https://www.thelocal.fr/20181120/latest-yellow-vest-fuel-protests-enter-fourth-day-as-french-government-stands-firm |accessdate=20 November 2018 |work=The Local |date=20 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;{{cite news |title='Shame' on Paris protesters, says Macron |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46331783 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |work=BBC News |date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to John Lichfield, those protests were not a protest, but an insurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ANALYSIS: The savage violence in Paris was not a protest, it was an insurrection |url=https://www.thelocal.fr/20181202/analysis-the-savage-violence-in-paris-was-not-a-protest-it-was-insurrection |accessdate=2 December 2018 |work=The Local |date=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The yellow jacket movement is not associated with a specific political party or trade union and has spread largely by social media.&lt;ref name=Walt&gt;{{cite news|author =  Vivienne Walt | url = http://time.com/5468025/emmanuel-macron-yellow-jackets-civil-war/ | title ='There Is an Atmosphere of Civil War.'

The protests in Paris having raised tensions the week before, the Interior Ministry agreed to allow a gathering on 24 November at the [[Champ de Mars]], the field stretching out beneath the [[Eiffel Tower]].&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; On that day, protests attracted  106,000 people all across France according to the Interior Ministry,&lt;ref name =Guardian&gt;{{cite news |last1=Willsher |first1=Kim |title=French 'gilets jaunes' protests turn violent on the streets of Paris |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/24/french-gilets-jaunes-protests-turn-violent-on-the-streets-of-paris |accessdate=27 November 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=24 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; only 8,000 of whom in Paris, where the protests turned violent. Protestors lit fires in the streets, tore down signs, built barricades and pulled up cobblestones. Police resorted to [[tear gas]] and water cannons to disperse the protesters.&lt;ref name=bbc2/&gt; The minister of the interior, [[Christophe Castaner]], blamed Macron's 2017 Presidential opponent [[Marine Le Pen]] and her [[Rassemblement National]] for the violence after she had reportedly urged people to go to the Champs Élysées.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; but Le Pen responded that letting these people assemble at [[Champs Élysées]] was the government's responsibility, accusing the interior minister of trying to ratchet up the tension to discredit the movement.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;
A protest called "Act 3 - Macron quits" was organised for 1 December, with the hope that it could be less violent than the previous weeks protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/Gilets-Jaunes-Protesters-warn-of-ports-disruption|title=Gilets Jaunes: Protesters warn of ports disruption|website=Connexionfrance.com|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests also occurred in the French [[overseas region]] of [[Réunion]], where the situation deteriorated into looting and riots. Schools on the island  were closed for three days due to protestors blocking access to roads. On 21 November, Macron ordered the deployment of troops to the island to calm the violence.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news | author = Associated Press | title=French troops deployed amid protests on Reunion island |url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/french-troops-deployed-amid-protests-reunion-island-59359264 |accessdate=22 November 2018 |work=ABC News |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Truckers have been targeted by protestors and the trucking industry has made their displeasure with the situation known to the government in an open letter.&lt;ref name=OTRE&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.otre.org/lettre-ouverte-au-premier-ministre-edouard-philippe/ | title=Lettre ouverte au Premier Ministre Edouard PHILIPPE | work = OTRE | date = 20 November 2018 | accessdate = 2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protests inspired in other countries===
According to Kim Willsher of ''[[The Guardian]]'', the ''gilets jaunes'' protests have also inspired imitation in Italy.  She cites an Italian organizer saying, "We are inspired by the French ''gilet jaunes'', (...) But we are motivated by other issues. We, unlike the French, support our government. What we protest against is Europe. We want Europe to no longer interfere with Italian politics."&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt;

Riot police in Brussels were pelted with [[billiard ball]]s, [[cobblestone]]s, and rocks on 30 November, and responded with water cannon in demonstrations which led to 60 arrests for disturbing the public order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = The Mercury News | author1 = Lorne Cook | author2 = Mark Carlson | title = ‘Yellow jacket’ tax protests spread: billiard balls vs. water cannons | url = https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/30/yellow-jacket-tax-protests-spread-billiard-balls-vs-water-cannons/ | date = November 30, 2018 | access-date = December 1, 2018 | language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several oil depots had been blocked in [[Wallonia]] as of 16 November 2018, though protesters' attempts to block the Russian [[Lukoil]] depot in Brussels were quickly thwarted by police.&lt;ref name="Monde_Wallonie"&gt;{{cite news | author = Jean-Pierre Stroobants |title=En Belgique, un mouvement de «&amp;nbsp;gilets jaunes&amp;nbsp;» se cherche un débouché politique |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2018/11/18/en-belgique-un-mouvement-de-gilets-jaunes-se-cherche-un-debouche-politique_5385244_3214.html |accessdate=27 November 2018 |work=Le Monde.fr |language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is now working to form a party for the [[Belgian federal election, 2019|Belgian federal elections in 2019]] under the name ''Mouvement citoyen belge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new|language=fr|url=https://www.lesoir.be/190768/article/2018-11-18/des-gilets-jaunes-creent-un-mouvement-politique-pour-les-prochaines-elections|title=Des «gilets jaunes» créent un mouvement politique pour les prochaines élections fédérales|newspaper=[[Le Soir]]|date=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Monde_Wallonie" /&gt; On 1 December, "yellow vest" demonstrators protested in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] cities of [[The Hague]], [[Nijmegen]], [[Maastricht]], [[Alkmaar]], [[Leeuwarden]] and [[Groningen]].&lt;ref name="YeniSafakNetherlands"/&gt;

==Casualties and property damage==
By 24 November, the ''gilets jaunes'' protests had led to two deaths and over 750 injuries, including 136 police officers.&lt;ref name=local2&gt;{{cite news |author = Ben McPartland | title=Paris: 'Yellow vest' protest marred by violent clashes with French police on Champs-Elysées |url=https://www.thelocal.fr/20181124/paris-police-use-tear-gas-water-cannon-against-yellow-vest-protesters |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=24 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, officials estimated that the damage in Paris alone could be up to €1.5m (£1.3m), and had mobilised 200 additional workers to assist with the cleanup and repair work.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Willsher |first1=Kim |title=Macron: Paris protest 'battle scenes' could hurt France's image |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/26/paris-begins-clean-up-after-gilets-jaunes-clash-protest-with-police |accessdate=27 November 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=26 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2 December, the ''gilets jaunes'' protests had led to three deaths, the third being in [[Arles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46417991|title=Paris riot could prompt state of emergency|date=2 December 2018|accessdate=2 December 2018|website=Bbc.com|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December, Macron called an emergency security meeting following the protests the previous day. This led to speculation that France could be put under a [[state of emergency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46417991|title=France fuel protests: Macron calls urgent security meeting|work=BBC News|date=2 December 2018|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than a hundred cars have been burnt in Paris during the protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ANALYSIS: The savage violence in Paris was not a protest, it was an insurrection |url=https://www.thelocal.fr/20181202/analysis-the-savage-violence-in-paris-was-not-a-protest-it-was-insurrection |accessdate=2 December 2018 |date=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Banque vandalisée.jpg|thumb|center|Tags in Paris after 1st of December riots.]]

==Fuel prices==
The protest began at the end of October 2018 with an online petition. The group constituted around this petition then protested against an increase in fuel prices they considered excessive, stating that this increase was due to the increase in taxes.&lt;ref name=Bianchi/&gt;

According to the French Union of Petroleum Industries, the price of lead-free 95 (SP95 - E10) and diesel fuel per litre increased by +14% and +22% respectively between October 2017 and October 2018. However, two thirds of this increase is due to the increase in world oil prices; only one third of the price increase comes from a tax increase. The tax increase had been 7.6 cents per litre on diesel and 3.9 cents on petrol in 2018, with a further increase of 6.5 cents on diesel and 2.9 cents on petrol planned for 1 January 2019.&lt;ref name=bbc2/&gt;

The taxes collected on the sale of fuel are:
* the domestic consumption tax on energy products (TICPE). TICPE is not calculated based on the price of oil, but rather at a fixed rate by volume. Part of this tax, paid at the pump, goes to the regional governments, part goes to the national government. Since 2014, this tax has included a carbon component&amp;mdash;increased each year&amp;mdash;the goal of which is to reduce fossil-fuel consumption. The TICPE for diesel fuel has been raised more radically in 2017 and 2018 to bring to the same levels as the tax on petrol;
* [[value added tax]] (VAT), calculated on the sum of the price excluding tax and the amount of the TICPE. Its rate has been stable at 20% since 2014, after having been at 19.6% between 2000 and 2014.
This protest movement against fuel prices mainly concerns individuals, as a number of professions and activities benefit from partial or total exemptions from TICPE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.fr/20181030/french-drivers-plan-road-blocks-to-protest-fuel-prices-but-are-they-right-to|title=Furious French drivers to block roads in fuel price protest, but are they right to?|work=The Local|date=30 October 2018|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OTRE/&gt;

The protesters criticize [[Édouard Philippe's second government]] for making individuals support the bulk of the cost of the carbon tax.    As the carbon tax has progressively been ramping up to meet ecological objectives,  many who have chosen fossil-fuel based heating for their homes, outside of city centers&amp;mdash;where a car is required&amp;mdash;are displeased.  Macron attempted to dispel these concerns in early November by offering special subsidies and incentives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Emmanuel Macron promet des aides pour le chauffage et le carburant | newspaper = Le Figaro | url = http://www.lefigaro.fr/conjoncture/2018/11/06/20002-20181106ARTFIG00073-emmanuel-macron-promet-des-aides-pour-le-chauffage-et-le-carburant.php | date = November 6, 2018 | access-date = December 2, 2018 | language = fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
