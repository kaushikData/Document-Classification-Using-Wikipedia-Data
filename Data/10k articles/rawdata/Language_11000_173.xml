"'''Abstract of judgment'''" is a written [[Summary (law)|summary]] of a [[judgment]] which states how much money the losing [[defendant]] owes to the person who won the lawsuit (judgment [[creditor]]), the [[rate of interest]] to be paid on the judgment amount, court costs, and any specific orders that the losing defendant ([[judgment debtor]]) must obey, which [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]] is acknowledged and stamped so that it can be recorded and made official with the government. The purpose of an abstract of judgment is to create a [[public record]] and create a [[lien]] or [[cause of action|claim]] if necessary on any [[real estate]] property owned or later acquired by the defendant located in the [[county]] in which the abstract of judgment is recorded. If the loser does not pay the judgment voluntarily then the winner can force a [[sheriff's sale]] of any property to collect. There are several problems: 1) to find the county where the loser owns real estate property; 2) the probability that there are [[secured loans]], [[tax liens]] and/or other judgments that come ahead of the judgment lien; 3) the possibility that the loser/debtor may go [[bankrupt]] and avoid paying the debt.

==United Kingdom==
An [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] is a brief summary of a judicial [[Legal judgment|judgment]], usually written by a [[Barrister]] or [[academic]] for publication in [[Reporter (law)|law reports]].

Abstracts are of particular use in [[legal research]] because they condense the essential points of long, complex judgments into a few paragraphs. A researcher can use abstracts to investigate how relevant a particular case is to the issue at hand, and hence to decide whether he or she should go on to read the entire judgment.

==United States==
The term '''"abstract of judgment"''' may be used in a generic sense to describe a condensed summary of a court case, but it is chiefly used in a technical sense to describe a document produced by a court which describes the judgment rendered in a case.

===Criminal law===
An '''abstract of judgment''' is a clerical document containing a summary of court proceedings which may be useful though not conclusive in proving a prior [[conviction (law)|conviction]] for the purposes of enhancement. ''United States v. Gutierrez-Ramirez'', 405 F.3d 352, 357 - 58 (5th Cir. 2005) (finding a sentencing court could not rely on an abstract of judgment to determine whether a prior conviction qualifies to enhance a sentence); ''United States v. Navidad-Marcos'', 367 F.3d 903, 908 - 09 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding an abstract of judgment did not "unequivocally" establish that a defendant entered a guilty plea); ''see also United States. v. Price'', 366 U.S. App. D.C. 166, 409 F.3d 436, 445 (D.C. Cir. 2005).

===Property law===
In some states, such as [[Texas]], an '''abstract of judgment''' is a specific type of document provided either by the [[court clerk]] or by an [[Lawyer|attorney]] which is used to prove that a judgment has been rendered. The abstract may then be filed in another jurisdiction, where it constitutes notice of a "judgment [[lien]]" on the [[debtor]]'s [[real property]], thereby preventing the transfer of that property until the judgment has been paid. This process was described by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1987:

:''See'' Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 52.002 (1984) (directing clerk to issue an abstract of the judgment "on application of a person in whose favor a judgment is rendered"; no exception for superseded judgments); ''Thulemeyer v. Jones,'' 37 Tex. 560, 571 (1872). The bond's only effect would be to prevent Pennzoil from executing the judgment and obtaining Texaco's property.

''Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc''., 481 U.S. 1, 5 (U.S. 1987)

{{Indian name|Jeyamohan|Bahuleyan}}
'''B. Jeyamohan''' (also credited as '''Jayamohan'''; born 22 April 1962) is a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malayalam]] writer and literary critic from [[Nagercoil]] in Kanyakumari District in the south Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]].

His best-known and most critically acclaimed work is ''Vishnupuram'', a fantasy set as a quest through various schools of Indian philosophy and  mythology. In 2014 he started his most ambitious work ''[[Venmurasu]]'', a modern renarration of the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''.

His other well-known novels include ''[[Rubber (Tamil novel)|Rubber]]'', ''Pin Thodarum Nizhalin Kural'', ''Kanyakumari'', ''Kaadu'', ''[[Pani Manidhan (Tamil novel)|Pani Manidhan]]'', ''Eazhaam Ulagam'' and ''[[Kotravai]]''. The early major influences in his life have been the humanitarian thinkers [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]]. Drawing on the strength of his life experiences and extensive travel around India, Jeyamohan is able to re-examine and interpret the essence of India's rich literary and classical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shankarramasubramanian|title=Interview: Writer Jeyamohan|url=http://tamil.thehindu.com/general/literature/%E0%AE%8E%E0%AE%B4%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B3%E0%AE%A9%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%B5%E0%AF%87%E0%AE%B1%E0%AF%81-%E0%AE%B5%E0%AF%87%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%88-%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95-%E0%AE%B5%E0%AF%87%E0%AE%A3%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%9F%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%AF%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%88-%E0%AE%9C%E0%AF%86%E0%AE%AF%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8B%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%A9%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%A8%E0%AF%87%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%A3%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%8D/article6385456.ece|website=tamil.thehindu.com|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born into a [[Malayali]] [[Nair]] family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jeyamohan|title=My biography|url=http://www.jeyamohan.in/about|website=jeyamohan.in|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Kanyakumari]] district that straddles Tamil Nadu and Kerala, Jeyamohan is  equally adept in Tamil and Malayalam. However, the bulk of his work has been in Tamil. Jeyamohan's output includes nine novels, ten volumes of short-stories/plays, thirteen literary criticisms, five biographies of writers, six introductions to Indian and Western literature,  three volumes on Hindu and Christian philosophy and numerous other translations and collections. He has also written scripts for Malayalam and Tamil movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://forbesindia.com/article/changing-lanes/the-tamil-film-industrys-new-storyline/26552/1|title=The Tamil Film Industry's New Storyline|last=Ramnath|first=N.S.|date=6 July 2011|work=Forbes India|accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jeyamohan was born on 22 April 1962 in Arumanai of Kanyakumari District,  Tamil Nadu, to S.Bahuleyan Pillai and B.Visalakshi Amma. Bahuleyan Pillai was an accounts clerk in the Arumanai registrar's office. Visalakshi Amma hailed from a family of intellectuals and trade-unionists. Jeyamohan's siblings were an elder brother and a younger sister. Bahuleyan's family followed him around on his work-related transfers to Thiruvattar and Arumanai towns in the Kanyakumari district.

Very early on, Jeyamohan was inspired by his mother to take up writing. Jeyamohan's first publication during schooldays was in ''Ratnabala'', a children's magazine, followed by a host of publications in popular weeklies. After high school, Jeyamohan was pressured by his father to take up commerce and accountancy in college. The suicide of a close friend drove him to drop out of college and constantly travel the country in search of physical and spiritual experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jeyamohan Interview, 2015|journal=Bhashaposhini, Malayala Manorama|date=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supported himself by taking up odd jobs and writing in pulp magazines all the while reading voraciously. He took up a temporary job at the Telephones department in [[Kasargode]] where he became close to the Leftist trade union circles. He received many of his formative ideas on historiography and literary narrative during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeyamohan Interview&amp;nbsp;— Early Life|url=http://www.tamilpaper.net/?p=1093|website=tamilpaper.net|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visalakshi and Bahuleyan committed suicide within a month of each other in 1984, and this drove Jeyamohan further into an itinerant lifestyle. He met writer Sundara Ramasamy in 1985 who took on the role of a mentor and encouraged him to take up writing seriously. Jeyamohan also got another mentor in the form of Aatroor Ravi Varma who sensitized him to the delicate balance between art and life. In parallel, Jeyamohan was an avid read of Indian classics and philosophical texts like the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About me|url=http://www.jeyamohan.in/about|website=jeyamohan.in|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Fiction &amp; literary criticism===
In 1987, the journal ''Kollippaavai'' published his poem ''Kaidhi'' (''The Prisoner''). In the same year, ''Nadhi'' (''The River'') was published in ''Kanaiyazhi'' with a critical mention from writer [[Ashoka Mitran]]. The journal ''Nigazh'' published ''Bodhi'', followed by ''Padugai'' ('The Riverbed'). Critics heaped praise on ''Padugai'' for its evocative narrative that wove together myths and contemporary visuals. Jeyamohan wrote his first full-fledged novel ''[[Rubber (Tamil novel)|Rubber]]'' in 1988 and then re-edited and published it in 1990.

The novel won the Akilan Memorial prize for its path-breaking portrayal of the ecological and sociological impact of rubber cultivation in the South Indian states of [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]. Jeyamohan's speech at the awards function was well received, and he further developed those ideas in ''Novel'' (1990), an exploration of the art form and its ideologies, and ''Naveena Thamizhilakkiya Arimugam'', a comprehensive introduction to modernist Tamil literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=C|first1=Saravanakarthikeyan|title=Jeyamohan Interview- Career|url=http://tamizmagazine.blogspot.in/2015/01/blog-post.html|website=tamilmagazine.net|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Jeyamohan met Guru [[Nitya Chaitanya Yati]] which proved to be a turning point in his spiritual journey. The dialogues with the Guru opened new views into the body of Indian thought, which culminated in his acclaimed work ''Vishnupuram'' in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I created Vishnupuram|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRgzI_BLtWQ|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeyamohan travelled and witnessed first-hand regional issues, droughts and political problems that underlay issues like [[Naxalism]] in tribal areas. His experiences convinced him of the continuing relevance of Gandhian idealism and non-violence as the sensible alternative to naked capitalism and militant socialism. The leftist in him had been saddened by the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and a decade long introspection on the nature of power and self-righteousness found expression in ''Pin Thodarum Nizhalin Kural'' in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohanarangan|first=Ka.|title=Varalaatrin Manasaatchiyai Theendum kural|journal=Vetkai|date=May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-2000, Jeyamohan broke new ground with ''Kaadu'' (2003), an exploration of the forest landscape as a metaphor for lust and the vigour of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kaadu Vimarsanam|url=http://inthiya.in/ta/?p=3501|work=Review of Kaadu|access-date=14 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818150104/http://inthiya.in/ta/?p=3501|archive-date=18 August 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kotravai]]'' (2005), the renarration of the [[Kannagi]] epic, was deemed by the writer and critics as his best yet in terms of structure and depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kotravai review&amp;nbsp;— A Ramasamy|url=http://www.thinnai.com/index.php?module=displaystory&amp;story_id=607012511|website=Thinnai.com|accessdate=7 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617095334/http://www.thinnai.com/index.php?module=displaystory&amp;story_id=607012511|archive-date=17 June 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gnani|title=Kotravai&amp;nbsp;– Special Issue|journal=Thamizhneyam|issue=January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kotravai&amp;nbsp;– Thamizhin Nalloozh|last1=Ira Somasundaram|url=http://www.keetru.com/vanam/sep07/somasundaram.php|work=Review of Kotravai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1998 to 2004, Jeyamohan and his friends edited a literary journal named ''Solputhithu''. In 2009, his readership circle created the '[[Vishnupuram Ilakkiya Vattam]]' to broaden the readership for serious literature in Tamil Nadu and to reward under-recognized pioneers of Tamil literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vishnupuram Ilakkiya Vattam|url=https://vishnupuram.wordpress.com/|website=Vishnupuram.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Madhavan selected for Vishnupuram award&amp;nbsp;— December 2010|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/books/article950673.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|accessdate=7 June 2016|date=2010-12-13|last1=Kolappan|first1=B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he turned 50, Jeyamohan wrote a set of short-stories, titled 'Aram', that explored the values and idealism that is possible in man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jeyamohan|title=Aram: short stories|url=http://www.jeyamohan.in/?p=13402}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Jeyamohan began writing ''[[Venmurasu]]'', a re-narration of the Indian epic Mahabharata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Venmurasu: A sublime literary masterpiece in the making|url=http://swarajyamag.com/culture/venmurasu-a-sublime-literary-masterpiece-in-the-making/|accessdate=|newspaper=Swarajya|date=12 November 2014|location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=I am renarrating the Indian Culture: Interview&amp;nbsp;— writer Jeyamohan|journal=The Hindu Deepavali Malar|volume=Deepavali 2014|issue=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Venmurasu: Interview with writer Jeyamohan|journal=Kungumam, Tamil Magazine|issue=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Venmurasu&amp;nbsp;— Puranic Realism|url=http://www.jeyamohan.in/46054|website=Jeyamohan.in|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jeyamohan's Venmurasu|journal=India Today, English Magazine|issue=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, Jeyamohan has produced a prolific output as one of the foremost Literary critics and theorists of modern Indian literature with focus on Tamil. His 30 volumes on criticism and anthologies have earned him a respectable place among critics like Vedasagayakumar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vedasagayakumar|title=Tamil Criticism|url=http://encyclopediatamilcriticism.com/criticism_history.php|website=Encyclopedia of Tamil Criticism|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jeyamohan|title=On Criticism&amp;nbsp;— Vallinam Vizha|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srtEkrDGOAc|website=youtube.com|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, he was considered as '''Tamil Author of the year''' by [[National Library, Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=National Library Board, Singapore|title=2013 Tamil Author of the Year|url=http://www.nlb.gov.sg/readsingapore/home/collection/under-one-sky/tamil-author-of-the-year/jeyamohan/|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he worked as [[Writer in residence]] for 2 months at [[Nanyang Technological University]], Singapore, organized by [[National Arts Council (Singapore)]] and [[National Institute of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tamil writer re-writing Mahabharata by posting one chapter every day online|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/novelist-once-begged-around-india|accessdate=21 September 2016|publisher=straitstimes|date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Website===
Jeyamohan had been an active participant in Tamil internet discussion groups like Mayyam, Forumhub and Thinnai.com during the early years of the medium in India. As part of the debates, Jeyamohan produced some of his best essays on literary standards and criticism during this period. Recognizing the possibility of losing some of these important works, Jeyamohan's friend and writer Cyril Alex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyril Alex|url=http://cyrilalex.com/|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; created the author's website for consolidating the author's works. Over the decade, the website has become an important repository of the author's essays running into thousands.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The author follows an innovative publishing model in which he serialises all new content on the website and allows free access, while simultaneously offering hardbacks and paperbacks through publishers. More significantly, the website allows the author to freely engage in discussions with thousands of readers on the axioms that govern his works and thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jeyamohan|title=Jeyamohan Website|url=http://www.jeyamohan.in/|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 2011, the Vishnupuram Ilakkiya Vattam has created an online moderated discussion group for discussing literature, criticism, art and related topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solputhithu|url=http://groups.google.com/group/solputhithu|work=Jeyamohan Readers Discussion Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gandhian movements &amp; Anna Hazare===
Jeyamohan gravitated towards Gandhian philosophy and political principles through debates with many intellectuals of the era. His considerable writing resulted in the corpus of essays published in 2009 as [[Indraya Gandhi]], a collection that examined the continuing relevance of Gandhi's methods and ideals in modern India. Indraya Gandhi explored new dimensions on Gandhi's life including his relationship with Nehru, Ambedkar and Dalit politics and the topic of Lust. Jeyamohan has continued to highlight many Gandhians who represent the philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Gandhians|url=http://www.jeyamohan.in/722|website=Jeyamohan.in|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a part of the series, he sought to explain how the next generation of Gandhian leaders like [[Anna Hazare]] were continuing to inspire the nation towards achieving true democracy and equality. Jeyamohan had been one of the first Indian ideologues to write about [[Anna Hazare]] many years before Anna Hazare's popular anti-graft movement. Jeyamohan had personally visited [[Ralegaon Siddhi]] to see Hazare's social movements in action, and he also wrote about Hazare's tireless struggle to get the [[Right to Information Act]] passed in the Indian parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeyamohan on Anna Hazare|url=http://www.dinamalar.com/special_detail.asp?id=746988|website=Dinamalar.com|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 2011, Jeyamohan continued to write about and support Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement and the [[Jan Lokpal]] bill. Rather than focus on the minutiae of the bill itself, Jeyamohan focused readers' attention on the ideology behind Hazare's actions&amp;nbsp;– how he appealed directly to the sense of justice in the common man, his symbolism, and the Gandhian method of achieving the ultimate goal through civil non-violent mass movement without letting up any opportunity to discuss and negotiate with political opponents. Amidst widespread scepticism and slander flamed up by the national and regional media across the political spectrum, Jeyamohan remained rock solid in support of Anna Hazare's movement. By the end of the summer of 2011, Jeyamohan had written close to 60 essays on the topic, many of them in answer to readers who had written in expressing their own doubts and questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jeyamohan Interview|agency=Prajavani|date=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, on the occasion of state elections in Tamil Nadu, Jeyamohan wrote a series of essays on Democracy in the newspaper [[Dinamalar]] which was published as a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the Laboratory of Democracy|url=http://www.dinamalar.com/news_detail.asp?id=1496921|website=Dinamalar.com|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmentalism===
Jeyamohan's works like 'Kaadu' and 'Mathagam' feature elephants in central roles, while his biographical and travel essays capture the centrality of nature, ecology and conservation to the Indian way of life. One such true-life story on the conservationist Dr.[[V. Krishnamurthy (veterinarian)]] ('Dr K, the Elephant Doctor') sparked huge interest and discussion among readers on the impact of humans on forest life. Told in semi-fictional form as through the eyes of a forest ranger, the story follows Dr K as, despite having a giant reputation in the naturalist circles, he eschews human accolades and seeks a much more rewarding life in the company of animals in the Indian Forest Department's elephant camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dr V Krishnamoorthy|title=Tryst With Tuskers|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/22/stories/2002072200010100.htm|website=thehindu.com|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'The Elephant Doctor' has been included in the Tamil textbook published by the Department of School Education,Tamil Nadu as part of the revised syllabus for the year 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://104.198.73.189/~ttapp/tnscert/|title=EBook(New Syllabus)|website=104.198.73.189|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
Jeyamohan has found himself at the centre of many controversies:
* In early 2008, Jeyamohan published a satire on Tamil movie icons [[M G Ramachandran]] and [[Sivaji Ganesan]]. A popular print weekly, ''[[Ananda Vikatan]]'', picked up on this and it resulted in a huge slander and threat campaign against the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeyamohan vs Ananda Vikatan: MGR Sivaji et al|url=https://snapjudge.wordpress.com/2008/02/16/jeyamohan-vs-anandha-vikadan-backgrounder-tamil-blogs-mgr-sivaji-et-al/|website=Snapjudge blog|accessdate=7 June 2013|date=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vikatan regrets controversy over Jeyamohan|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/controversy-over-mgr--sivaji-vikatan-regrets-tamil-news-37230.html|website=Indiaglitz.com|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jeyamohan firmly rejects any notion of offering serious literary status to the works of [[M Karunanidhi]], who he classifies under romantic/historical fiction writers. This raised the ire of the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] party members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seshadri|first1=Badri|title=Litterateurs &amp; Sycophants|url=http://www.badriseshadri.in/2003_10_12_thoughtsintamil_archive.html#106620489437563386|website=badriseshadri.in|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2014, Jeyamohan criticized the undue attention that some women writers were cornering without having produced any literary work off merit. This generated a controversy as some activists sought to portray his remarks as misogynist. Jeyamohan responded with his own statements criticizing the intentional slander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Women writers, activists hit out at Jeyamohan|url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/women-writers-activists-hit-out-at-jeyamohan/article6131376.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|accessdate=6 June 2016|date=2014-06-19|last1=Yamunan|first1=Sruthisagar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Jeyamohan was introduced to Arunmozhi Nangai as a reader and married her in 1991. Their son Ajithan was born in 1993 and daughter Chaitanya in 1997.

{{BMovie}}

A '''B movie''' or '''B film''' is a [[Low-budget film|low-budget]] commercial [[film|movie]], but not an [[arthouse film]]. In its original usage, during the [[Cinema of the United States#Portrait of Classical Hollywood Cinema and the Golden Age of Hollywood (1917–1960)|Golden Age of Hollywood]], the term more precisely identified films intended for distribution as the less-publicized bottom half of a [[double feature]] (akin to [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] for recorded music). Although the U.S. production of movies intended as '''second features''' largely ceased by the end of the 1950s, the term ''B movie'' continues to be used in its broader sense to this day. In its post-Golden Age usage, there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition: on the one hand, the primary interest of many inexpensive [[exploitation film]]s is prurient; on the other, many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity.

In either usage, most B movies represent a particular [[Film genre|genre]]—the [[Western (genre)|Western]] was a Golden Age B movie staple, while low-budget [[science-fiction film|science-fiction]] and [[horror film|horror]] films became more popular in the 1950s. Early B movies were often part of series in which the star repeatedly played the same character. Almost always shorter than the top-billed films they were paired with,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/B-film|title=B-film {{!}} motion-picture commercial grade|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; many had running times of 70 minutes or less. The term connoted a general perception that B movies were inferior to the more lavishly budgeted headliners; individual B films were often ignored by critics.

Latter-day B movies still sometimes inspire multiple [[sequel]]s, but series are less common. As the average running time of top-of-the-line films increased, so did that of B pictures. In its current usage, the term has somewhat contradictory connotations: it may signal an opinion that a certain movie is (a) a genre film with minimal artistic ambitions or (b) a lively, energetic film uninhibited by the constraints imposed on more expensive projects and unburdened by the conventions of putatively "serious" [[independent film]]. The term is also now used loosely to refer to some higher-budgeted, mainstream films with exploitation-style content, usually in genres traditionally associated with the B movie.

From their beginnings to the present day, B movies have provided opportunities both for those coming up in the profession and others whose careers are waning. Celebrated filmmakers such as [[Anthony Mann]] and [[Jonathan Demme]] learned their craft in B movies. They are where actors such as [[John Wayne]] and [[Jack Nicholson]] first became established, and they have provided work for former A movie actors, such as [[Vincent Price]] and [[Karen Black]]. Some actors, such as [[Bela Lugosi]], [[Eddie Constantine]] and [[Pam Grier]], worked in B movies for most of their careers. The term ''B actor'' is sometimes used to refer to a performer who finds work primarily or exclusively in B pictures.

Soon, director [[Frank Capra]]'s association with Columbia would help vault the studio toward Hollywood's major leagues.&lt;ref name="Hirschhorn 1999, pp. 9–10, 17"&gt;Hirschhorn (1999), pp. 9–10, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1927–28, at the end of the [[silent film|silent era]], the production cost of an average feature from a [[major film studio|major Hollywood studio]] ranged from $190,000 at [[20th Century Fox|Fox]] to $275,000 at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. That average reflected both "specials" that might cost as much as {{Nowrap|$1 million}} and films made quickly for around $50,000. These cheaper films (not yet called ''B movies'') allowed the studios to derive maximum value from facilities and contracted staff in between a studio's more important productions, while also breaking in new personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Finler (2003), pp. 41–42; Balio (2003), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Studios in the minor leagues of the industry, such as [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Film Booking Offices of America]] (FBO), focused on exactly those sorts of cheap productions. Their movies, with relatively short running times, targeted theaters that had to economize on rental and operating costs, particularly small-town and urban neighborhood venues, or "nabes". Even smaller production houses, known as [[Poverty Row]] studios, made films whose costs might run as low as $3,000, seeking a profit through whatever bookings they could pick up in the gaps left by the larger concerns.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Taves (1995), p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the widespread arrival of [[sound film]] in American theaters in 1929, many independent exhibitors began dropping the then-dominant presentation model, which involved live acts and a broad variety of [[short subject|shorts]] before a single featured film. A new programming scheme developed that would soon become standard practice: a [[newsreel]], a short and/or [[movie serial|serial]], and a [[animated cartoon|cartoon]], followed by a double feature. The second feature, which actually screened before the main event, cost the exhibitor less per minute than the equivalent running time in shorts. The majors' "clearance" rules favoring their affiliated theaters prevented the independents' timely access to top-quality films; the second feature allowed them to promote quantity instead.&lt;ref&gt;Balio (1995), p. 29. See also Schatz (1999), pp. 16, 324.&lt;/ref&gt; The additional movie also gave the program "balance"—the practice of pairing different sorts of features suggested to potential customers that they could count on something of interest no matter what specifically was on the bill. The low-budget picture of the 1920s thus evolved into the second feature, the B movie, of Hollywood's Golden Age.&lt;ref&gt;See Finler (2003), pp. 26, 41–43, 47–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golden Age of Hollywood===
{{Main|B movies (Hollywood Golden Age)}}

==== 1930s ====
The [[studio system|major studios]], at first resistant to the double feature, soon adapted. All established B units to provide films for the expanding second-feature market. [[Block booking]] became standard practice: to get access to a studio's attractive A pictures, many theaters were obliged to rent the company's entire output for a season. With the B films rented at a flat fee (rather than the box office percentage basis of A films), rates could be set virtually guaranteeing the profitability of every B movie. The parallel practice of [[block booking|blind bidding]] largely freed the majors from worrying about their Bs' quality—even when booking in less than seasonal blocks, exhibitors had to buy most pictures sight unseen. The five largest studios—[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Fox Film Corporation]] ([[20th Century Fox]] as of 1935), [[Warner Bros.]], and [[RKO Radio Pictures]] (descendant of FBO)—also belonged to companies with sizable theater chains, further securing the bottom line.&lt;ref&gt;Finler (2003), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poverty Row studios, from modest outfits like [[Mascot Pictures]], [[Tiffany (movie studio)|Tiffany Pictures]], and [[Sono Art-World Wide Pictures]] down to shoestring operations, made exclusively B movies, serials, and other shorts, and also distributed totally independent productions and imported films. In no position to directly block book, they mostly sold regional distribution exclusivity to "[[Film distribution#Pre-studio era|states rights]]" firms, which in turn peddled blocks of movies to exhibitors, typically six or more pictures featuring the same star (a relative status on Poverty Row).&lt;ref&gt;Taves (1995), pp. 326–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Two "major-minors"—[[Universal Studios]] and rising Columbia Pictures—had production lines roughly similar to, though somewhat better endowed than, the top Poverty Row studios. In contrast to the Big Five majors, Universal and Columbia had few or no theaters, though they did have top-rank [[film distribution]] exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Balio (1995), pp. 103–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the standard Golden Age model, the industry's top product, the A films, premiered at a small number of select first-run houses in major cities. Double features were not the rule at these prestigious venues. As described by [[Edward Jay Epstein]], "During these first runs, films got their reviews, garnered publicity, and generated the word of mouth that served as the principal form of advertising."&lt;ref&gt;Epstein (2005), p. 6. See also Schatz (1999), pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Then it was off to the subsequent-run market where the double feature prevailed. At the larger local venues controlled by the majors, movies might turn over on a weekly basis. At the thousands of smaller, independent theaters, programs often changed two or three times a week. To meet the constant demand for new B product, the low end of Poverty Row turned out a stream of micro-budget movies rarely much more than sixty minutes long; these were known as "quickies" for their tight production schedules—as short as four days.&lt;ref name = "Taves_p325"&gt;Taves (1995), p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; As Brian Taves describes, "Many of the poorest theaters, such as the 'grind houses' in the larger cities, screened a continuous program emphasizing action with no specific schedule, sometimes offering six quickies for a nickel in an all-night show that changed daily."&lt;ref&gt;Taves (1995), p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; Many small theaters never saw a big-studio A film, getting their movies from the states rights concerns that handled almost exclusively Poverty Row product. Millions of Americans went to their local theaters as a matter of course: for an A picture, along with the [[Trailer (film)|trailers]], or screen previews, that presaged its arrival, "[t]he new film's title on the marquee and the listings for it in the local newspaper constituted all the advertising most movies got", writes Epstein.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein (2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from at the theater itself, B films might not be advertised at all.

The introduction of sound had driven costs higher: by 1930, the average U.S. feature film cost $375,000 to produce.&lt;ref name=F42&gt;Finler (2003), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; A broad range of motion pictures occupied the B category. The leading studios made not only clear-cut A and B films, but also movies classifiable as "programmers" (also known as "in-betweeners" or "intermediates"). As Taves describes, "Depending on the prestige of the theater and the other material on the double bill, a programmer could show up at the top or bottom of the marquee."&lt;ref&gt;Taves (1995), p. 317. Taves (like this article) adopts the usage of "programmer" argued for by author Don Miller in his 1973 study ''B Movies'' (New York: Ballantine). As Taves notes, "the term ''programmer'' was used in a variety of different ways by reviewers" of the 1930s (p. 431, n. 8). Some present-day critics employ the Miller–Taves usage; others refer to any B movie from the Golden Age as a "programmer" or "program picture."&lt;/ref&gt; On Poverty Row, many Bs were made on budgets that would have barely covered petty cash on a major's A film, with costs at the bottom of the industry running as low as $5,000.&lt;ref name = "Taves_p325"/&gt; By the mid-1930s, the double feature was the dominant U.S. exhibition model, and the majors responded. In 1935, B movie production at Warner Bros. was raised from 12 to 50% of studio output. The unit was headed by [[Bryan Foy]], known as the "Keeper of the Bs".&lt;ref&gt;Balio (1995), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; At Fox, which also shifted half of its production line into B territory, [[Sol M. Wurtzel]] was similarly in charge of more than twenty movies a year during the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Finler (2003), pp. 26, 111, 116.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PalsOfSaddlePoster.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stony Brooke ([[John Wayne|Wayne]]), Tucson Smith ([[Ray "Crash" Corrigan|Corrigan]]), and Lullaby Joslin ([[Max Terhune|Terhune]]) did not get much time in harness. [[Republic Pictures]]' ''[[Pals of the Saddle]]'' (1938) lasts just 55 minutes, average for a [[The Three Mesquiteers|Three Mesquiteers]] adventure.]]
A number of the top Poverty Row firms consolidated: Sono Art joined another company to create [[Monogram Pictures]] early in the decade. In 1935, Monogram, Mascot, and several smaller studios merged to establish [[Republic Pictures]]. The former heads of Monogram soon sold off their Republic shares and set up a new Monogram production house.&lt;ref&gt;Tuska (1999), pp. 183–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Into the 1950s, most Republic and Monogram product was roughly on par with the low end of the majors' output. Less sturdy Poverty Row concerns—with a penchant for grand sobriquets like Conquest, Empire, Imperial, and Peerless—continued to churn out dirt-cheap quickies.&lt;ref&gt;See Taves (1995), pp. 321–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Joel Finler has analyzed the average length of feature releases in 1938, indicating the studios' relative emphasis on B production&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from Finler (2003), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[United Artists]] produced little, focusing on the distribution of prestigious films from independent outfits; [[Grand National Films Inc.|Grand National]], active 1936–40, occupied an analogous niche on Poverty Row, releasing mostly independent productions&lt;ref&gt;See Taves (1995), p. 323; McCarthy and Flynn (1975), p. 20. In its peak year, 1937, Grand National did produce around twenty pictures of its own.&lt;/ref&gt;):

Taves estimates that half of the films produced by the eight majors in the 1930s were B movies. Calculating in the three hundred or so films made annually by the many Poverty Row firms, approximately 75% of Hollywood movies from the decade, more than four thousand pictures, are classifiable as Bs.&lt;ref&gt;Taves (1995), p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western was by far the predominant B genre in both the 1930s and, to a lesser degree, the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Nachbar (1974), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Film historian Jon Tuska has argued that "the 'B' product of the Thirties—the Universal films with [[Tom Mix|[Tom] Mix]], [[Ken Maynard|[Ken] Maynard]], and [[Buck Jones|[Buck] Jones]], the Columbia features with Buck Jones and [[Tim McCoy]], the RKO [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] series, the Republic Westerns with [[John Wayne]] and the [[The Three Mesquiteers|Three Mesquiteers]] ... achieved a uniquely American perfection of the well-made story."&lt;ref&gt;Tuska (1974), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; At the far end of the industry, Poverty Row's Ajax put out [[:wikt:oater|oater]]s starring [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]], then in his fifties. The Weiss outfit had the Range Rider series, the American Rough Rider series, and the Morton of the Mounted "northwest action thrillers".&lt;ref&gt;Taves (1995), pp. 327–28.&lt;/ref&gt; One low-budget oater of the era, made totally outside the studio system, profited from an outrageous concept: a Western with an all-midget cast, ''[[The Terror of Tiny Town]]'' (1938) was such a success in its independent bookings that Columbia picked it up for distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Taves (1995), p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

Series of various genres, featuring recurrent, title-worthy characters or name actors in familiar roles, were particularly popular during the first decade of sound film. Fox's many B series, for instance, included [[Charlie Chan]] mysteries, [[Ritz Brothers]] comedies, and musicals with child star [[Jane Withers]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Taves (1995), p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; These series films are not to be confused with the short, [[cliffhanger]]-structured serials that sometimes appeared on the same program. As with serials, however, many series were intended to attract young people—a theater that twin-billed part-time might run a "balanced" or entirely youth-oriented double feature as a matinee and then a single film for a more mature audience at night. In the words of one industry report, afternoon moviegoers, "composed largely of housewives and children, want quantity for their money while the evening crowds want 'something good and not too much of it.'"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Schatz (1999), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Series films are often unquestioningly consigned to the B movie category, but even here there is ambiguity: at MGM, for example, popular series like the [[Andy Hardy]] and the [[Dr. Kildare]] - [[Dr. Gillespie]] chronicles had leading stars and budgets that would have been A-level at most of the lesser studios.&lt;ref&gt;Naremore (1998), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; For many series, even a lesser major's standard B budget was far out of reach: Poverty Row's Consolidated Pictures featured Tarzan, the Police Dog in a series with the proud name of Melodramatic Dog Features.&lt;ref&gt;Taves (1995), p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1940s====
By 1940, the average production cost of an American feature was $400,000, a negligible increase over ten years.&lt;ref name =F42/&gt; A number of small Hollywood companies had folded around the turn of the decade, including the ambitious [[Grand National Films Inc.|Grand National]], but a new firm, [[Producers Releasing Corporation]] (PRC), emerged as third in the Poverty Row hierarchy behind Republic and Monogram. The double feature, never universal, was still the prevailing exhibition model: in 1941, 50% of theaters were double-billing exclusively, and others employed the policy part-time.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1999), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1940s, legal pressure forced the studios to replace seasonal block booking with packages generally limited to five pictures. Restrictions were also placed on the majors' ability to enforce blind bidding.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1999), pp. 19–21, 45, 72, 160–63.&lt;/ref&gt; These were crucial factors in the progressive shift by most of the Big Five over to A-film production, making the smaller studios even more important as B movie suppliers. Genre pictures made at very low cost remained the backbone of Poverty Row, with even Republic's and Monogram's budgets rarely climbing over $200,000. Many smaller Poverty Row firms folded as the eight majors, with their proprietary distribution exchanges, now commanded about 95% of U.S. and Canadian box office receipts.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1999), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, independent producer [[David O. Selznick]] brought his bloated-budget spectacle ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' to market with heavy nationwide promotion and wide release. The distribution strategy was a major success, despite what was widely perceived as the movie's poor quality.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1993), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Duel'' release anticipated practices that fueled the B movie industry in the late 1950s; when the top Hollywood studios made them standard two decades after that, the B movie would be hard hit.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Finler (2003), pp. 4, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerations beside cost made the line between A and B movies ambiguous. Films shot on B-level budgets were occasionally marketed as A pictures or emerged as [[sleeper hit]]s: one of 1943's biggest films was ''[[Hitler's Children (1943 film)|Hitler's Children]]'', an RKO thriller made for a fraction over $200,000. It earned more than {{Nowrap|$3 million}} in rentals, industry language for a distributor's share of gross [[box office]] receipts.&lt;ref&gt;Jewell (1982), 181; Lasky (1989), 184–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in the realm of [[film noir]], A pictures sometimes echoed visual styles generally associated with cheaper films. Programmers, with their flexible exhibition role, were ambiguous by definition. As late as 1948, the double feature remained a popular exhibition mode—it was standard policy at 25% of theaters and used part-time at an additional 36%.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1999), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The leading Poverty Row firms began to broaden their scope; in 1947, Monogram established a subsidiary, [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]], to develop and distribute relatively expensive films, mostly from independent producers. Around the same time, Republic launched a similar effort under the "Premiere" rubric.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1999), pp. 340–41.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 as well, PRC was subsumed by [[Eagle-Lion Films|Eagle-Lion]], a British company seeking entry to the American market. Warners' former "Keeper of the Bs", Brian Foy, was installed as production chief.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1999), p. 295; Naremore (1998), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RawDealPoster2.jpg|thumb|lright|250px|Often marketed as pure sensationalism, many [[film noir|films noir]] also possessed great visual beauty. ''[[Raw Deal (1948 film)|Raw Deal]]'' (1948), writes scholar Robert Smith, is "resplendent with velvety blacks, mists, netting, and other expressive accessories of poetic noir decor and lighting."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Smith ("Mann in the Dark," ''Bright Lights'' 2, no. 1 [fall 1976]), quoted in Ottoson (1981), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Directed by [[Anthony Mann]] and [[cinematography|shot]] by [[John Alton]], it was released by Poverty Row's [[Eagle-Lion Films|Eagle-Lion]] firm.]]
In the 1940s, RKO stood out among the industry's Big Five for its focus on B pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1999), p. 173, table 6.3.&lt;/ref&gt; From a latter-day perspective, the most famous of the major studios' Golden Age B units is [[Val Lewton]]'s horror unit at RKO. Lewton produced such moody, mysterious films as ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'' (1942), ''[[I Walked with a Zombie]]'' (1943), and ''[[The Body Snatcher (film)|The Body Snatcher]]'' (1945), directed by [[Jacques Tourneur]], [[Robert Wise]], and others who would become renowned only later in their careers or entirely in retrospect.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1999), p. 232; Finler (2003), pp. 219–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The movie now widely described as the first classic film noir—''[[Stranger on the Third Floor]]'' (1940), a 64-minute B—was produced at RKO, which would release many additional melodramatic thrillers in a similarly stylish vein.&lt;ref&gt;Finler (2003), p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; The other major studios also turned out a considerable number of movies now identified as noir during the 1940s. Though many of the best-known film noirs were A-level productions, most 1940s pictures in the mode were either of the ambiguous programmer type or destined straight for the bottom of the bill. In the decades since, these cheap entertainments, generally dismissed at the time, have become some of the most treasured products of Hollywood's Golden Age.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Dave Kehr, "Critic's Choice: New DVD's," ''The New York Times'', August 22, 2006; Dave Kehr, "Critic's Choice: New DVD's," ''The New York Times'', June 7, 2005; Robert Sklar, "Film Noir Lite: When Actions Have No Consequences," ''The New York Times'', "Week in Review," June 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one sample year, 1947, RKO produced along with several noir programmers and A pictures, two straight B noirs: ''[[Desperate (film)|Desperate]]'' and ''[[The Devil Thumbs a Ride]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jewell (1982), pp. 218, 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten B noirs that year came from Poverty Row's big three—Republic, Monogram, and PRC/Eagle-Lion—and one came from tiny Screen Guild. Three majors beside RKO contributed a total of five more. Along with these eighteen unambiguous B noirs, an additional dozen or so noir programmers came out of Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed consideration of classic B noir, see Lyons (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Still, most of the majors' low-budget production remained the sort now largely ignored. RKO's representative output included the [[Lupe Vélez|Mexican Spitfire]] and [[Lum and Abner]] comedy series, thrillers featuring the [[Simon Templar|Saint]] and the [[The Falcon (literary character)|Falcon]], Westerns starring [[Tim Holt]], and [[Tarzan]] movies with [[Johnny Weissmuller]]. [[Jean Hersholt]] played [[Dr. Christian]] in six films between 1939 and 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Finler (2003), pp. 214–15.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Courageous Dr. Christian]]'' (1940) was a standard entry: "In the course of an hour or so of screen time, the saintly physician managed to cure an epidemic of spinal meningitis, demonstrate benevolence towards the disenfranchised, set an example for wayward youth, and calm the passions of an amorous old maid."&lt;ref&gt;Jewell (1982), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Down in Poverty Row, low budgets led to less palliative fare. Republic aspired to major-league respectability while making many cheap and modestly budgeted Westerns, but there was not much from the bigger studios that compared with Monogram "[[exploitation film|exploitation pictures]]" like [[juvenile delinquency]] [[Investigative journalism|exposé]] ''Where Are Your Children?'' (1943) and the prison film ''[[Women in Bondage]]'' (1943).&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1999), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, PRC's [[The Devil on Wheels (1947 film)|''The Devil on Wheels'']] brought together teenagers, [[hot rods]], and death. The little studio had its own house [[auteur]]: with his own crew and relatively free rein, director [[Edgar G. Ulmer]] was known as "the Capra of PRC".&lt;ref&gt;Naremore (1998), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Ulmer made films of every generic stripe: his ''[[Girls in Chains]]'' was released in May 1943, six months before ''Women in Bondage''; by the end of the year, Ulmer had also made the teen-themed musical ''Jive Junction'' as well as ''[[Isle of Forgotten Sins]]'', a South Seas adventure set around a brothel.&lt;ref&gt;See Mank (2001), p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition in the 1950s===
{{Main|B movies in the 1950s}}
In 1948, a Supreme Court ruling in a [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|federal antitrust suit against the majors]] outlawed block booking and led to the Big Five divesting their theater chains. With audiences draining away to television and studios scaling back production schedules, the classic double feature vanished from many American theaters during the 1950s. The major studios promoted the benefits of recycling, offering former headlining movies as second features in the place of traditional B films.&lt;ref&gt;Strawn (1974), p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; With television airing many classic Westerns as well as producing its own original Western series, the cinematic market for B oaters in particular was drying up. After barely inching forward in the 1930s, the average U.S. feature production cost had essentially doubled over the 1940s, reaching {{Nowrap|$1 million}} by the turn of the decade—a 93% rise after adjusting for inflation.&lt;ref name =F42/&gt;

The first prominent victim of the changing market was Eagle-Lion, which released its last films in 1951. By 1953, the old Monogram brand had disappeared, the company having adopted the identity of its higher-end subsidiary, Allied Artists. The following year, Allied released Hollywood's last B series Westerns. Non-series B Westerns continued to appear for a few more years, but Republic Pictures, long associated with cheap sagebrush sagas, was out of the filmmaking business by decade's end. In other genres, Universal kept its [[Ma and Pa Kettle]] series going through 1957, while Allied Artists stuck with the Bowery Boys until 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Lev (2003), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; RKO, weakened by years of mismanagement, exited the movie industry in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Lasky (1989), p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood's A product was getting longer—the top ten box-office releases of 1940 had averaged 112.5 minutes; the average length of 1955's top ten was 123.4.&lt;ref&gt;See Finler (2003), pp. 357–58, for top films. Finler lists ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]'' as 1955, when it made most of its money, but it premiered in December 1954. ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' replaces it in this analysis (the two films happen to be virtually identical in length).&lt;/ref&gt; In their modest way, the Bs were following suit. The age of the hour-long feature film was past; 70 minutes was now roughly the minimum. While the Golden Age-style second feature was dying, ''B movie'' was still used to refer to any low-budget genre film featuring relatively unheralded performers (sometimes referred to as ''B actors''). The term retained its earlier suggestion that such movies relied on formulaic plots, "stock" character types, and simplistic action or unsophisticated comedy.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Matthews (2007), p. 92; Lyons (2000), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the realm of the B movie was becoming increasingly fertile territory for experimentation, both serious and outlandish.

[[Ida Lupino]], a leading actress, established herself as Hollywood's sole female director of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Lev (2003), pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, low-budget pictures made for her production company, The Filmakers, Lupino explored virtually taboo subjects such as rape in 1950's ''[[Outrage (1950 film)|Outrage]]'' and 1953's self-explanatory ''[[The Bigamist (1953 film)|The Bigamist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hurd (2007), pp. 10–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Her best known directorial effort, ''[[The Hitch-Hiker (1953 film)|The Hitch-Hiker]]'', a 1953 RKO release, is the only film noir from the genre's classic period directed by a woman.&lt;ref&gt;Muller (1998), p. 176; Cousins (2004), p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, RKO released ''[[Split Second (1953 film)|Split Second]]'', which concludes in a nuclear test range, and is perhaps the first "atomic noir".&lt;ref&gt;Jewell (1982), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous such movie, the independently produced ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'' (1955), typifies the persistently murky middle ground between the A and B picture, as Richard Maltby describes: a "programmer capable of occupying either half of a neighbourhood theatre's double-bill, [it was] budgeted at approximately $400,000. [Its] distributor, United Artists, released around twenty-five programmers with production budgets between $100,000 and $400,000 in 1955."&lt;ref&gt;Maltby (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; The film's length, 106 minutes, is A level, but its star, [[Ralph Meeker]], had previously appeared in only one major film. Its source is pure [[pulp magazine|pulp]], one of [[Mickey Spillane]]'s [[Mike Hammer]] novels, but [[Robert Aldrich]]'s direction is self-consciously aestheticized. The result is a brutal genre picture that also evokes contemporary anxieties about what was often spoken of simply as the Bomb.&lt;ref&gt;Schrader (1972), p. 61; Silver (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RocketshipXM2.jpg|thumb|left|285px|''[[Rocketship X-M]]'' (1950), produced and released by small Lippert Pictures, is cited as possibly "the first postnuclear holocaust film."&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro (2002), p. 96. See also [http://www.conelrad.com/conelrad100/index.html Atomic Films: The CONELRAD 100].&lt;/ref&gt; It was at the leading edge of a large cycle of movies, mostly low-budget and many long forgotten, classifiable as "atomic bomb cinema".]]
The fear of nuclear war with the Soviet Union, along with less expressible qualms about radioactive fallout from America's own atomic tests, energized many of the era's genre films. Science fiction, horror, and various hybrids of the two were now of central economic importance to the low-budget end of the business. Most down-market films of the type—like many of those produced by [[William Alland]] at Universal (such as ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' (1954)) and [[Sam Katzman]] at Columbia (including ''[[It Came from Beneath the Sea]]'' (1955))—provided little more than thrills, though their special effects could be impressive.&lt;ref&gt;Kinnard (1988), pp. 67–73.&lt;/ref&gt; But these were genres whose fantastic nature could also be used as cover for mordant cultural observations often difficult to make in mainstream movies. Director [[Don Siegel]]'s ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' (1956), released by Allied Artists, treats conformist pressures and the evil of banality in haunting, allegorical fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Lev (2003), pp. 186, 184; Braucort (1970), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Amazing Colossal Man]]'' (1957), directed by [[Bert I. Gordon]], is both a monster movie that happens to depict the horrific effects of radiation exposure and "a ferocious cold-war fable [that] spins [[Korean War|Korea]], the army's obsessive secrecy, and America's post-war growth into one fantastic whole."&lt;ref&gt;Auty (2005), p. 34. See also Shapiro (2002), pp. 120–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Amazing Colossal Man'' was released by a new company whose name was much bigger than its budgets. [[American International Pictures]] (AIP), founded in 1956 by [[James H. Nicholson]] and [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]] in a reorganization of their American Releasing Corporation (ARC), soon became the leading U.S. studio devoted entirely to B-cost productions. American International helped keep the original-release double bill alive through paired packages of its films: these movies were low-budget, but instead of a flat rate, they were rented out on a percentage basis, like A films.&lt;ref&gt;Strawn (1974), p. 259; Lev (2003), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The success of ''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]'' (1957) thus brought AIP a large return—made for about $100,000, it grossed more than {{Nowrap|$2 million}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz (2002), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; As the film's title suggests, the studio relied on both fantastic genre subjects and new, teen-oriented angles. When ''Hot Rod Gang'' (1958) turned a profit, hot rod horror was given a try: ''Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow'' (1959). David Cook credits AIP with leading the way "in [[market segment|demographic exploitation]], [[target market]]ing, and saturation booking, all of which would become standard procedure for the majors in planning and releasing their mass-market 'event' films" by the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2000), p. 324. See also p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of content, the majors were already there, with films about [[juvenile delinquency]] such as Warner Bros.' ''[[Untamed Youth]]'' (1957) and MGM's ''[[High School Confidential (film)|High School Confidential]]'' (1958), both starring [[Mamie Van Doren]].&lt;ref&gt;Denisoff and Romanowski (1991), pp. 64–65, 95–100, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, a young filmmaker named [[Roger Corman]] received his first screen credits as writer and associate producer of Allied Artists' ''[[Highway Dragnet]]''. Corman soon independently produced his first movie, ''[[Monster from the Ocean Floor]]'', on a $12,000 budget and a six-day shooting schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Di Franco (1979), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the six films he worked on in 1955, Corman produced and directed the first official ARC release, ''[[Apache Woman]]'', and ''[[Day the World Ended]]'', half of Arkoff and Nicholson's first twin-bill package. Corman would go on to direct over fifty feature films through 1990. As of 2007, he remained active as a producer, with more than 350 movies to his credit. Often referred to as the "King of the Bs", Corman has said that "to my way of thinking, I never made a 'B' movie in my life", as the traditional B movie was dying out when he began making pictures. He prefers to describe his metier as "low-budget exploitation films".&lt;ref&gt;Corman (1998), p. 36. It appears Corman made at least one true B picture—according to Arkoff, ''Apache Woman'', to Corman's displeasure, was handled as a second feature (Strawn [1974], p. 258).&lt;/ref&gt; In later years Corman, both with AIP and as head of his own companies, would help launch the careers of [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Jonathan Demme]], [[Robert Towne]], and [[Robert De Niro]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;Rausch and Dequina (2008), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s, [[William Castle]] became known as the great innovator of the B movie publicity gimmick. Audiences of ''Macabre'' (1958), an $86,000 production distributed by Allied Artists, were invited to take out insurance policies to cover potential death from fright. The 1959 creature feature ''[[The Tingler]]'' featured Castle's most famous gimmick, Percepto: at the film's climax, buzzers attached to select theater seats would unexpectedly rattle a few audience members, prompting either appropriate screams or even more appropriate laughter.&lt;ref&gt;Heffernan (2004), pp. 102–4.&lt;/ref&gt; With such films, Castle "combine[d] the saturation advertising campaign perfected by Columbia and Universal in their Sam Katzman and William Alland packages with centralized and standardized publicity stunts and gimmicks that had previously been the purview of the local exhibitor."&lt;ref&gt;Heffernan (2004), pp. 95–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The postwar [[drive-in theater]] boom was vital to the expanding independent B movie industry. In January 1945, there were 96 drive-ins in the United States; a decade later, there were more than 3,700.&lt;ref&gt;Segrave (1992), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Unpretentious pictures with simple, familiar plots and reliable shock effects were ideally suited for auto-based film viewing, with all its attendant distractions. The phenomenon of the drive-in movie became one of the defining symbols of American popular culture in the 1950s. At the same time, many local television stations began showing B genre films in late-night slots, popularizing the notion of the [[midnight movie]].&lt;ref&gt;Heffernan (2004), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly, American-made genre films were joined by foreign movies acquired at low cost and, where necessary, dubbed for the U.S. market. In 1956, distributor [[Joseph E. Levine]] financed the shooting of new footage with American actor [[Raymond Burr]] that was edited into the Japanese sci-fi horror film ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews (2007), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[Hammer Film Productions]] made the successful ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'' (1957) and ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' (1958), major influences on future horror film style. In 1959, Levine's [[Embassy Pictures]] bought the worldwide rights to ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'', a cheaply made Italian movie starring American-born bodybuilder [[Steve Reeves]]. On top of a $125,000 purchase price, Levine then spent {{Nowrap|$1.5 million}} on advertising and publicity, a virtually unprecedented amount.&lt;ref name = Cook324&gt;Cook (2000), p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' was not impressed, claiming that the movie would have drawn "little more than yawns in the film market&amp;nbsp;... had it not been [launched] throughout the country with a deafening barrage of publicity."&lt;ref&gt;Nason (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; Levine counted on first-weekend box office for his profits, booking the film "into as many cinemas as he could for a week's run, then withdrawing it before poor word-of-mouth withdrew it for him."&lt;ref&gt;Hirschhorn (1979), p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hercules'' opened at a remarkable 600 theaters, and the strategy was a smashing success: the film earned {{Nowrap|$4.7 million}} in domestic rentals. Just as valuable to the bottom line, it was even more successful overseas.&lt;ref name = Cook324/&gt; Within a few decades, Hollywood would be dominated by both movies and an exploitation philosophy very much like Levine's.

===Golden age of exploitation===

====1960s====
{{Main|B movies (exploitation boom)|Midnight movie}}
Despite all the transformations in the industry, by 1961 the average production cost of an American feature film was still only {{Nowrap|$2 million}}—after adjusting for inflation, less than 10% more than it had been in 1950.&lt;ref name =F42/&gt; The traditional twin bill of B film preceding and balancing a subsequent-run A film had largely disappeared from American theaters. The AIP-style dual genre package was the new model. In July 1960, the latest Joseph E. Levine [[Sword and sandal|sword-and-sandals]] import, ''[[Hercules and the Queen of Lydia|Hercules Unchained]]'', opened at neighborhood theaters in New York. A suspense film, ''[[Terror Is a Man]]'', ran as a "co-feature" with a now familiar sort of exploitation gimmick: "The dénouement helpfully includes a 'warning bell' so the sensitive can 'close their eyes.'"&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (1960).&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Roger Corman took AIP down a new road: "When they asked me to make two ten-day black-and-white horror films to play as a double feature, I convinced them instead to finance one horror film in color."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Di Franco (1979), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting ''[[House of Usher (film)|House of Usher]]'' typifies the continuing ambiguities of B picture classification. It was clearly an A film by the standards of both director and studio, with the longest shooting schedule and biggest budget Corman had ever enjoyed. But it is generally seen as a B movie: the schedule was still a mere fifteen days, the budget just $200,000 (one tenth the industry average),&lt;ref&gt;Per Corman, quoted in Di Franco (1979), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; and its 85-minute running time close to an old thumbnail definition of the B: "Any movie that runs less than 80 minutes."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Reid (2005a), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the loosening of industry [[Production Code|censorship constraints]], the 1960s saw a major expansion in the commercial viability of a variety of B movie subgenres that became known collectively as ''exploitation films''. The combination of intensive and gimmick-laden publicity with movies featuring vulgar subject matter and often outrageous imagery dated back decades—the term had originally defined truly fringe productions, made at the lowest depths of Poverty Row or entirely outside the Hollywood system. Many graphically depicted the wages of sin in the context of promoting prudent lifestyle choices, particularly "[[Exploitation film#1930s and 1940s cautionary films|sexual hygiene]]". Audiences might see explicit footage of anything from a live birth to a ritual circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (1999), pp. 187, 376.&lt;/ref&gt; Such films were not generally booked as part of movie theaters' regular schedules but rather presented as special events by traveling roadshow promoters (they might also appear as fodder for "[[grindhouse]]s", which typically had no regular schedule at all). The most famous of those promoters, [[Kroger Babb]], was in the vanguard of marketing low-budget, sensationalistic films with a "100% saturation campaign", inundating the target audience with ads in almost any imaginable medium.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (1999), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In the era of the traditional double feature, no one would have characterized these graphic exploitation films as "B movies". With the majors having exited traditional B production and exploitation-style promotion becoming standard practice at the lower end of the industry, "exploitation" became a way to refer to the entire field of low-budget genre films.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (1992), p. 176, n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s would see exploitation-style themes and imagery become increasingly central to the realm of the B.

[[File:MotorpsychoPoster.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Motorpsycho (film)|Motorpsycho]]'' (1965) was not hard to market. It had director [[Russ Meyer]]'s reputation for eroticism; the biker theme ("MURDERcycles") that would soon prove its popularity in historic fashion; and that trendy title word—''psycho''.]]
Exploitation movies in the original sense continued to appear: 1961's ''Damaged Goods'', a [[cautionary tale]] about a young lady whose boyfriend's promiscuity leads to [[venereal disease]], comes complete with enormous, grotesque closeups of VD's physical effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gibron, Bill |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/roadshow.php |title=''Something Weird Traveling Roadshow Films'' |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=July 24, 2003 |accessdate=2006-11-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020055922/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/roadshow.php |archivedate=20 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the concept of fringe exploitation was merging with a related, similarly venerable tradition: "[[Nudity in film|nudie]]" films featuring nudist-camp footage or striptease artists like [[Bettie Page]] had simply been the [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] pornography of previous decades. As far back as 1933, ''This Nude World'' was "Guaranteed the Most Educational Film Ever Produced!"&lt;ref&gt;Halperin (2006), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1950s, as more of the old grindhouse theaters devoted themselves specifically to "adult" product, a few filmmakers began making nudies with greater attention to plot. Best known was [[Russ Meyer]], who released his first successful narrative nudie, the comic ''[[The Immoral Mr. Teas|Immoral Mr. Teas]]'', in 1959. Five years later, Meyer came out with his breakthrough film, ''[[Lorna (film)|Lorna]]'', which combined sex, violence, and a dramatic storyline.&lt;ref&gt;Frasier (1997), pp. 7–8, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!]]'' (1965), made for about $45,000, would ultimately become the most famous of Meyer's [[sexploitation]] pictures. Crafted for constant titillation but containing no nudity, it was aimed at the same "passion pit" drive-in circuit that screened AIP teen movies with wink-wink titles like ''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]'' (1965) and ''[[How to Stuff a Wild Bikini]]'' (1966), starring [[Annette Funicello]] and [[Frankie Avalon]].&lt;ref&gt;Frasier (1997), pp. 9–11, 90; Denisoff and Romanowski (1991), pp. 116–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Corman's ''[[The Trip (1967 film)|The Trip]]'' (1967) for American International, written by veteran AIP/Corman actor [[Jack Nicholson]], never shows a fully bared, unpainted breast, but flirts with nudity throughout.&lt;ref&gt;Frank (1998), p. 186; McGilligan (1996), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The Meyer and Corman lines were drawing closer.

One of the most influential films of the era, on Bs and beyond, was Paramount's ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. Its {{Nowrap|$8.5 million}} in earnings against a production cost of $800,000 made it the most profitable movie of 1960.&lt;ref name=C222&gt;Cook (2000), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; Its mainstream distribution without the [[Production Code]] seal of approval helped weaken U.S. film censorship. And, as William Paul notes, this move into the horror genre by respected director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] was made, "significantly, with the lowest-budgeted film of his American career and the least glamorous stars. [Its] greatest initial impact&amp;nbsp;... was on schlock horror movies (notably those from second-tier director William Castle), each of which tried to bill itself as scarier than ''Psycho''."&lt;ref&gt;Paul (1994), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Castle's first film in the ''Psycho'' vein was ''[[Homicidal]]'' (1961), an early step in the development of the [[slasher film|slasher]] subgenre that would take off in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=C222/&gt; ''[[Blood Feast]]'' (1963), a movie about human dismemberment and culinary preparation made for approximately $24,000 by experienced nudie-maker [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]], established a new, more immediately successful subgenre, the gore or [[splatter film]]. Lewis's business partner [[David F. Friedman]] drummed up publicity by distributing vomit bags to theatergoers—the sort of gimmick Castle had mastered—and arranging for an injunction against the film in Sarasota, Florida—the sort of problem exploitation films had long run up against, except Friedman had planned it.&lt;ref&gt;Rockoff (2002), pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; This new breed of gross-out movie typified the emerging sense of "exploitation"—the progressive adoption of traditional exploitation and nudie elements into horror, into other classic B genres, and into the low-budget film industry as a whole. Imports of Hammer Film's increasingly explicit horror movies and Italian [[giallo|gialli]], highly stylized pictures mixing sexploitation and ultraviolence, would fuel this trend.&lt;ref&gt;Langford (2005), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Production Code was officially scrapped in 1968, to be replaced by the first version of the modern [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rating system]].&lt;ref&gt;Heffernan (2004), p. 221; Cook (2002), pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, two horror films came out that heralded directions American cinema would take in the next decade, with major consequences for the B movie. One was a high-budget Paramount production, directed by the celebrated [[Roman Polanski]]. Produced by B horror veteran William Castle, ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' was the first upscale Hollywood picture in the genre in three decades.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2000), pp. 222–23.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a critical success and the year's seventh-biggest hit.&lt;ref&gt;Heffernan (2004), pp. 190, 200–1.&lt;/ref&gt; The other was [[George A. Romero]]'s ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', produced on weekends in and around Pittsburgh for $114,000. Building on the achievement of B genre predecessors like ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' in its subtextual exploration of social and political issues, it doubled as a highly effective thriller and an incisive allegory for both the [[Vietnam War]] and domestic racial conflicts. Its greatest influence, though, derived from its clever subversion of genre clichés and the connection made between its exploitation-style imagery, low-cost, truly independent means of production, and high profitability.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2000), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; With the Code gone and the [[X-rated|X rating]] established, major studio A films like ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' could now show "adult" imagery, while the market for increasingly [[hardcore pornography]] exploded. In this transformed commercial context, work like Russ Meyer's gained a new legitimacy. In 1969, for the first time a Meyer film, ''[[Finders Keepers, Lovers Weepers!]]'', was reviewed in ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, Corman would be putting out nudity-filled sexploitation pictures such as ''Private Duty Nurses'' (1971) and ''[[Women in Cages]]'' (1971).&lt;ref&gt;Di Franco (1979), pp. 162, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1969, the most important exploitation movie of the era premiered at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Mathijs and Mendik (2008), p. 167; James (2005), pp. 282, 398; Cagin and Dray (1984), pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of ''[[Easy Rider]]''{{'}}s significance owes to the fact that it was produced for a respectable, if still modest, budget and released by a major studio. The project was first taken by one of its cocreators, [[Peter Fonda]], to American International. Fonda had become AIP's top star in the Corman-directed ''[[The Wild Angels]]'' (1966), a biker movie, and ''The Trip'', as in taking [[LSD]]. The idea Fonda pitched would combine those two proven themes. AIP was intrigued but balked at giving his collaborator, [[Dennis Hopper]], also a studio alumnus, free directorial rein. Eventually they arranged a financing and distribution deal with Columbia, as two more graduates of the Corman/AIP exploitation mill joined the project: Jack Nicholson and cinematographer [[László Kovács (cinematographer)|László Kovács]].&lt;ref&gt;Cagin and Dray (1984), pp. 61–66.&lt;/ref&gt; The film (which incorporated another favorite exploitation theme, the [[redneck]] menace, as well as a fair amount of nudity) was brought in at a cost of $501,000. It earned {{Nowrap|$19.1 million}} in rentals.&lt;ref&gt;Financial figures per associate producer William L. Hayward, cited in Biskind (1998), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of historians Seth Cagin and [[Philip Dray]], ''Easy Rider'' became "the seminal film that provided the bridge between all the repressed tendencies represented by schlock/kitsch/hack since the dawn of Hollywood and the mainstream cinema of the seventies."&lt;ref&gt;Cagin and Dray (1984), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|The golden age of exploitation: 1970s}}

====1970s====
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a new generation of low-budget film companies emerged that drew from all the different lines of exploitation as well as the sci-fi and teen themes that had been a mainstay since the 1950s. Operations such as Roger Corman's [[New World Pictures]], [[Cannon Films]], and [[New Line Cinema]] brought exploitation films to mainstream theaters around the country. The major studios' top product was continuing to inflate in running time—in 1970, the ten biggest earners averaged 140.1 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;See Finler (2003), p. 359, for top films. Finler lists ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' as 1970, when it made most of its money, but it premiered in December 1969. ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat (film)|The Owl and the Pussycat]]'', 51 minutes shorter, replaces it in this analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bs were keeping pace. In 1955, Corman had a producorial hand in five movies averaging 74.8 minutes. He played a similar part in five films originally released in 1970, two for AIP and three for his own New World: the average length was 89.8 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;From 1955: ''[[Apache Woman]]'', ''[[The Beast with a Million Eyes]]'', ''[[Day the World Ended]]'', ''[[The Fast and the Furious (1954 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'', and ''[[Five Guns West]]''. From 1970: ''Angels Die Hard'', ''[[Bloody Mama]]'', ''[[The Dunwich Horror#Adaptations|The Dunwich Horror]]'', ''Ivanna'' (aka ''Scream of the Demon Lover''; U.S. premiere: 1971), and ''The Student Nurses''. For purchase of ''Ivanna'': Di Franco (1979), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; These films could turn a tidy profit. The first New World release, the biker movie ''Angels Die Hard'', cost $117,000 to produce and took in more than {{Nowrap|$2 million}} at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;Di Franco (1979), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest studio in the low-budget field remained a leader in exploitation's growth. In 1973, American International gave a shot to young director [[Brian De Palma]]. Reviewing ''[[Sisters (1973 film)|Sisters]]'', [[Pauline Kael]] observed that its "limp technique doesn't seem to matter to the people who want their gratuitous gore.&amp;nbsp;... [H]e can't get two people talking in order to make a simple expository point without its sounding like the drabbest Republic picture of 1938."&lt;ref&gt;Kael (1973), p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; Many examples of the [[blaxploitation]] genre, featuring stereotype-filled stories revolving around drugs, violent crime, and prostitution, were the product of AIP. One of blaxploitation's biggest stars was [[Pam Grier]], who began her film career with a bit part in Russ Meyer's ''[[Beyond the Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1970). Several New World pictures followed, including ''[[The Big Doll House]]'' (1971) and ''[[The Big Bird Cage]]'' (1972), both directed by [[Jack Hill]]. Hill also directed her best-known performances, in two AIP blaxploitation films: ''[[Coffy]]'' (1973) and ''[[Foxy Brown (film)|Foxy Brown]]'' (1974).&lt;ref&gt;Willis (1997), p. 254, n. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blaxploitation was the first exploitation genre in which the major studios were central. Indeed, the United Artists release ''[[Cotton Comes to Harlem]]'' (1970), directed by [[Ossie Davis]], is seen as the first significant film of the type.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (2008), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; But the movie that truly ignited the blaxploitation phenomenon was completely independent: ''[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song]]'' (1971) is also perhaps the most outrageous example of the form: wildly experimental, borderline pornographic, and essentially a manifesto for a black American revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2000), p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melvin Van Peebles]] wrote, co-produced, directed, starred in, edited, and composed the music for the film, which was completed with a loan from [[Bill Cosby]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Peebles (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Its distributor was small [[Cinemation Industries]], then best known for releasing dubbed versions of the Italian ''[[Mondo Cane]]'' "shockumentaries" and the Swedish skin flick ''[[Fanny Hill#Literary and film adaptations|Fanny Hill]]'', as well as for its one in-house production, ''[[The Man from O.R.G.Y.]]'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Haines (2003), p. 69; Landis and Clifford (2002), pp. 117–21.&lt;/ref&gt; These sorts of films played in the "grindhouses" of the day—many of them not outright porno theaters, but rather venues for all manner of exploitation cinema. The days of six quickies for a nickel were gone, but a continuity of spirit was evident.&lt;ref&gt;Haines (2003), p. 49; Landis and Clifford (2002), pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PiranhaPosterA.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''[[Piranha (1978 film)|Piranha]]'' (1978), directed by [[Joe Dante]] and written by [[John Sayles]] for Corman's [[New World Pictures]], is an action-filled [[horror film|creature feature]], an environmentalist [[cautionary tale]], and a humorous parody of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''. It was one of many exploitation films to mimic the design of ''Jaws''{{'}} [[:File:JAWS Movie poster.jpg|famous poster]], "with its promise of titillating thrills."&lt;ref&gt;Hunter (2009), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1970, a low-budget crime drama shot in [[16 mm film|16&amp;nbsp;mm]] by first-time American director [[Barbara Loden]] won the [[FIPRESCI|international critics' prize]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=Mer&gt;Merritt (2000), p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wanda (film)|Wanda]]'' is both a seminal event in the independent film movement and a classic B picture. The crime-based plot and often seedy settings would have suited a straightforward exploitation film or an old-school B noir. The $115,000 production,&lt;ref name=Mer/&gt; for which Loden spent six years raising money, was praised by [[Vincent Canby]] for "the absolute accuracy of its effects, the decency of its point of view and&amp;nbsp;... purity of technique."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Reynaud (2006).

The first three features directed by [[Larry Cohen]], ''[[Bone (1972 film)|Bone]]'' (1972), ''[[Black Caesar (film)|Black Caesar]]'' (1973), and ''[[Hell Up in Harlem]]'' (1973), were all nominally blaxploitation movies, but Cohen used them as vehicles for a satirical examination of race relations and the wages of dog-eat-dog capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1996), pp. 171–73.&lt;/ref&gt; The gory horror film ''[[Deathdream]]'' (1974), directed by [[Bob Clark]], is also an agonized protest of the war in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Wood (2003), pp. 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian filmmaker [[David Cronenberg]] made serious-minded low-budget horror films whose implications are not so much ideological as psychological and existential: ''[[Shivers (film)|Shivers]]'' (1975), ''[[Rabid (film)|Rabid]]'' (1977), ''[[The Brood]]'' (1979).&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman (1998), pp. 118–28; Williams (1996), pp. 198–200.&lt;/ref&gt; An ''Easy Rider'' with conceptual rigor, the movie that most clearly presaged the way in which exploitation content and artistic treatment would be combined in modestly budgeted films of later years was United Artists' biker-themed ''[[Electra Glide in Blue]]'' (1973), directed by [[James William Guercio]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Milne (2005), p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' reviewer thought little of it: "Under different intentions, it might have made a decent grade-C Roger Corman bike movie—though Corman has generally used more interesting directors than Guercio."&lt;ref&gt;Greenspun (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, the growing practice of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, with the goal of building a [[cult film]] audience, brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema, now in a [[countercultural]] setting—something like a drive-in movie for the [[hip (slang)|hip]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Stevenson (2003), pp. 49–50; Hollows (2003); Staiger (2000), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first films adopted by the new circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old ''Night of the Living Dead''. The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside the studio system, like [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]' ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement.&lt;ref&gt;Merritt (2000), pp. 254–57.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as ''Rocky Horror'' generated its own [[subculture|subcultural]] phenomenon, it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie.&lt;ref&gt;Hoberman and Rosenbaum (1983), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian [[martial arts films]] began appearing as imports regularly during the 1970s. These "[[kung fu]]" films as they were often called, whatever martial art they featured, were popularized in the United States by the Hong Kong–produced movies of [[Bruce Lee]] and marketed to the same audience targeted by AIP and New World.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2000), pp. 266–71; Desser (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Horror continued to attract young, independent American directors. As [[Roger Ebert]] explained in one 1974 review, "Horror and exploitation films almost always turn a profit if they're brought in at the right price. So they provide a good starting place for ambitious would-be filmmakers who can't get more conventional projects off the ground."&lt;ref&gt;Ebert (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; The movie under consideration was ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''. Made by [[Tobe Hooper]] for less than $300,000, it became one of the most influential horror films of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;For the film's cost: West (1974), p. 9; Rockoff (2002), p. 42. For its influence: Sapolsky and Molitor (1996), p. 36; Rubin (1999), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), produced on a $320,000 budget, grossed over {{Nowrap|$80 million}} worldwide and effectively established the slasher flick as horror's primary mode for the next decade. Just as Hooper had learned from Romero's work, ''Halloween'', in turn, largely followed the model of ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (1974), directed by ''Deathdream''{{'}}s Bob Clark.&lt;ref&gt;For the film's cost and worldwide gross: Harper (2004), pp. 12–13. For its influence and debt to ''Black Christmas'': Rockoff (2002), pp. 42–44, 50–55; Paul (1994), p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

On television, the parallels between the weekly series that became the mainstay of [[prime-time]] programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long been clear.&lt;ref&gt;Waterman (2005), pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, original feature-length programming increasingly began to echo the B movie as well. As production of [[TV movies]] expanded with the introduction of the ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'' in 1969, soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original features, time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B picture territory. Television films inspired by recent scandals—such as ''The Ordeal of [[Patty Hearst]]'', which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979—harkened all the way back to the 1920s and such movies as ''[[Human Wreckage]]'' and ''[[When Love Grows Cold]]'', FBO pictures made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (1999), p. 224; Goodwin (1987), p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Many 1970s TV films—such as ''[[The California Kid]]'' (1974), starring [[Martin Sheen]]—were action-oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production. ''[[Nightmare in Badham County]]'' (1976) headed straight into the realm of road-tripping-girls-in-redneck-bondage exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Levine (2007), pp. 114–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reverberations of ''Easy Rider'' could be felt in such pictures, as well as in a host of theatrical exploitation films. But its greatest influence on the fate of the B movie was less direct—by 1973, the major studios were catching on to the commercial potential of genres once largely consigned to the bargain basement. ''Rosemary's Baby'' had been a big hit, but it had little in common with the exploitation style. Warner Bros.' ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' demonstrated that a heavily promoted horror film could be an absolute blockbuster: it was the biggest movie of the year and by far the highest-earning horror movie yet made. In William Paul's description, it is also "the film that really established gross-out as a mode of expression for mainstream cinema.&amp;nbsp;... [P]ast exploitation films managed to exploit their cruelties by virtue of their marginality. ''The Exorcist'' made cruelty respectable. By the end of the decade, the exploitation booking strategy of opening films simultaneously in hundreds to thousands of theaters became standard industry practice."&lt;ref&gt;Paul (1994), pp. 288, 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Writer-director [[George Lucas]]'s ''[[American Graffiti]]'', a Universal production, did something similar. Described by Paul as "essentially an American-International teenybopper pic with a lot more spit and polish", it was 1973's third-biggest film and, likewise, by far the highest-earning teen-themed movie yet made.&lt;ref&gt;Paul (1994), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Even more historically significant movies with B themes and A-level financial backing would follow in their wake.

===Decline===
{{Main|B movies since the 1980s}}

====1980s====
Most of the B movie production houses founded during the exploitation era collapsed or were subsumed by larger companies as the field's financial situation changed in the early 1980s. Even a comparatively cheap, efficiently made genre picture intended for theatrical release began to cost millions of dollars, as the major movie studios steadily moved into the production of expensive genre movies, raising audience expectations for spectacular action sequences and realistic special effects.&lt;ref&gt;Heffernan (2004), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Intimations of the trend were evident as early as ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970) and especially in the mega-schlock of ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' (1972), ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' (1973), and ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974). Their disaster plots and dialogue were B-grade at best; from an industry perspective, however, these were pictures firmly rooted in a tradition of star-stuffed extravaganzas. ''The Exorcist'' had demonstrated the drawing power of big-budget, effects-laden horror. But the tidal shift in the majors' focus owed largely to the enormous success of three films: [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[monster movie|creature feature]] ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975) and George Lucas's [[space opera]] ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) had each, in turn, become the highest-grossing film in motion picture history. ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', released in December 1978, had proved that a studio could spend {{Nowrap|$55 million}} on a movie about a children's comic book character and turn a big profit—it was the top box-office hit of 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=superman.htm|title=''Superman'' (1978)|publisher=Box Office Mojo|date=|accessdate=2006-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blockbuster fantasy spectacles like the original 1933 ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' had once been exceptional; in the new Hollywood, increasingly under the sway of multi-industrial conglomerates, they would rule.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Major film studio#Organizational lineage]] for a record of the sales and mergers involving the eight major studios of the Golden Age.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blood simple.jpg|thumb|right|250px|"Too gory to be an art film, too arty to be an exploitation film, funny but not quite a comedy": 168 private investors backed ''[[Blood Simple]]'''s {{Nowrap|$1.5 million}} budget.&lt;ref&gt;David Handelman ("The Brothers from Another Planet," ''Rolling Stone'', May 21, 1987), quoted in Russell (2001), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Brothers [[Joel and Ethan Coen]] brought a striking visual style to the 1984 noir. In one repeated motif, writes [[David Denby (film critic)|David Denby]], "automobile headlights threaten people doing surreptitious things in the dark."&lt;ref&gt;Denby (1985), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It had taken a decade and a half, from 1961 to 1976, for the production cost of the average Hollywood feature to double from $2 million to $4 million—a decline if adjusted for inflation. In just four years it more than doubled again, hitting $8.5 million in 1980 (a constant-dollar increase of about 25%). Even as the U.S. inflation rate eased, the average expense of moviemaking would continue to soar.&lt;ref&gt;Finler (2003), p. 42. Prince (2002) gives {{Nowrap|$9 million}} as the average production cost in 1980, and a total of {{Nowrap|$13 million}} after adding on costs for manufacturing exhibition prints and marketing (p. 20). See also p. 21, chart 1.2. The Box Office Mojo website gives {{Nowrap|$9.4 million}} as the 1980 production figure; see {{cite web |author=|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/|title=Movie Box Office Results by Year, 1980–Present|publisher=Box Office Mojo|date=|accessdate=2006-12-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061230012726/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/| archivedate= 30 December 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the majors now routinely saturation booking in over a thousand theaters, it was becoming increasingly difficult for smaller outfits to secure the exhibition commitments needed to turn a profit. Double features were now literally history—almost impossible to find except at [[revival house]]s. One of the first leading casualties of the new economic regime was venerable B studio Allied Artists, which declared bankruptcy in April 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Lubasch (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s, AIP had turned to producing relatively expensive films like the very successful ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|Amityville Horror]]'' and the disastrous ''[[Meteor (film)|Meteor]]'' in 1979. The studio was sold off and dissolved as a moviemaking concern by the end of 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2000), pp. 323–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the mounting financial pressures, distribution obstacles, and overall risk, many genre movies from small studios and independent filmmakers were still reaching theaters. Horror was the strongest low-budget genre of the time, particularly in the slasher mode as with ''[[The Slumber Party Massacre]]'' (1982), written by feminist author [[Rita Mae Brown]]. The film was produced for New World on a budget of $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;Collum (2004), pp. 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 1983, Corman sold New World; New Horizons, later Concorde–New Horizons, became his primary company. In 1984, New Horizons released a critically applauded movie set amid the [[punk subculture|punk scene]] written and directed by [[Penelope Spheeris]]. ''The New York Times'' review concluded: "''[[Suburbia (film)|Suburbia]]'' is a good genre film."&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

Larry Cohen continued to twist genre conventions in pictures such as ''[[Q (film)|Q]]'' (a.k.a. ''Q: The Winged Serpent''; 1982), described by critic Chris Petit as "the kind of movie that used to be indispensable to the market: an imaginative, popular, low-budget picture that makes the most of its limited resources, and in which people get on with the job instead of standing around talking about it."&lt;ref&gt;Petit (2005), p. 1481.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, New Line put out ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]'', a John Waters movie with a small budget and an old-school exploitation gimmick: Odorama. That October ''The Book of the Dead'', a gore-filled yet stylish horror movie made for less than $400,000, debuted in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;Cost per Bruce Campbell, cited in Warren (2001), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Its writer, director, and co-executive producer, [[Sam Raimi]], was a week shy of his twenty-second birthday; star and co-executive producer [[Bruce Campbell]] was twenty-three. It was picked up for distribution by New Line, retitled ''[[The Evil Dead]]'', and became a hit. In the words of one newspaper critic, it was a "shoestring ''tour de force''."&lt;ref&gt;David Chute (''Los Angeles Herald-Examiner'', May 27, 1983), quoted in Warren (2001), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most successful 1980s B studios was a survivor from the heyday of the exploitation era, [[Troma Entertainment|Troma Pictures]], founded in 1974. Troma's most characteristic productions, including ''[[Class of Nuke 'Em High]]'' (1986), ''[[Redneck Zombies]]'' (1986), and ''[[Surf Nazis Must Die]]'' (1987), take exploitation for an absurdist spin. Troma's best-known production is ''[[The Toxic Avenger (film)|The Toxic Avenger]]'' (1985); its hideous hero, affectionately known as Toxie, was featured in several sequels and a TV cartoon series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kraus, Daniel|url=http://www.salon.com/people/feature/1999/10/30/troma|title=Tromatized!|publisher=Salon|date=October 30, 1999|accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few successful B studio startups of the decade was Rome-based [[Empire International Pictures|Empire Pictures]], whose first production, ''[[Ghoulies]]'', reached theaters in 1985. The video rental market was becoming central to B film economics: Empire's financial model relied on seeing a profit not from theatrical rentals, but only later, at the video store.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow (1996), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Concorde–New Horizon releases went this route as well, appearing only briefly in theaters, if at all. The growth of the [[cable television]] industry also helped support the low-budget film industry, as many B movies quickly wound up as "filler" material for 24-hour cable channels or were made expressly for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Berra (2008), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1990s====
By 1990, the cost of the average U.S. film had passed {{Nowrap|$25 million}}.&lt;ref name = Bomojo&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/|title=Movie Box Office Results by Year, 1980–Present|publisher=Box Office Mojo|date=|accessdate=2006-12-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061230012726/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/| archivedate= 30 December 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the nine films released that year to gross more than {{Nowrap|$100 million}} at the U.S. box office, two would have been strictly B movie material before the late 1970s: ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' and ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''. Three more—the science-fiction thriller ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'', the action-filled detective thriller ''[[Die Hard 2]]'', and the year's biggest hit, the slapstick kiddie comedy ''[[Home Alone]]''—were also far closer to the traditional arena of the Bs than to classic A-list subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1990&amp;p=.htm|title=1990 Yearly Box Office Results|publisher=Box Office Mojo|date=|accessdate=2006-12-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061206182952/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1990&amp;p=.htm| archivedate= 6 December 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} Dick Tracy literally had been B movie material—the character was featured in four low-budget RKO films in the 1940s. For how espionage and crimebusting thrillers were long "widely regarded as nothing more than B-movie fodder," see Chapman (2000), pp. 46–50.&lt;/ref&gt; The growing popularity of home video and access to unedited movies on cable and [[satellite television]] along with real estate pressures were making survival more difficult for the sort of small or non-chain theaters that were the primary home of independently produced genre films.&lt;ref&gt;Heffernan (2004), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Drive-in screens were rapidly disappearing from the American landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Finler (2003), p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving B movie operations adapted in different ways. Releases from Troma now frequently went [[direct-to-video|straight to video]]. New Line, in its first decade, had been almost exclusively a distributor of low-budget independent and foreign genre pictures. With the smash success of exploitation veteran [[Wes Craven]]'s original ''[[Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984), whose nearly {{Nowrap|$2 million}} cost it had directly backed, the company began moving steadily into higher-budget genre productions. In 1994, New Line was sold to the [[Turner Broadcasting System]]; it was soon being run as a midsized studio with a broad range of product alongside Warner Bros. within the [[Time Warner]] conglomerate.&lt;ref&gt;Finler (2003), pp. 287, 290.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] launched ''Roger Corman Presents'', a series of thirteen straight-to-cable movies produced by Concorde–New Horizons. A ''New York Times'' reviewer found that the initial installment qualified as "vintage Corman&amp;nbsp;... spiked with everything from bared female breasts to a mind-blowing quote from [[Thomas Mann]]'s ''[[Death in Venice]]''."&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as exhibition venues for B films vanished, the independent film movement was burgeoning; among the results were various crossovers between the low-budget genre movie and the "sophisticated" arthouse picture. Director [[Abel Ferrara]], who built a reputation with violent B movies such as ''[[The Driller Killer]]'' (1979) and ''[[Ms. 45]]'' (1981), made two works in the early nineties that marry exploitation-worthy depictions of sex, drugs, and general sleaze to complex examinations of honor and redemption: ''[[King of New York]]'' (1990) was backed by a group of mostly small production companies and the cost of ''[[Bad Lieutenant]]'' (1992), {{Nowrap|$1.8 million}}, was financed totally independently.&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone (1999), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry Fessenden]]'s micro-budget monster movies, such as ''No Telling'' (1991) and ''[[Habit (1997 film)|Habit]]'' (1997), reframe classic genre subjects—[[Frankenstein]] and [[vampire|vampirism]], respectively—to explore issues of contemporary relevance.&lt;ref&gt;King (2005), pp. 167, 170–75.&lt;/ref&gt; The budget of David Cronenberg's ''[[Crash (1996 film)|Crash]]'' (1996), {{Nowrap|$10 million}}, was not comfortably A-grade, but it was hardly B-level either. The film's imagery was another matter: "On its scandalizing surface, David Cronenberg's ''Crash'' suggests exploitation at its most disturbingly sick", wrote critic [[Janet Maslin]].&lt;ref&gt;Maslin (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Financed, like ''King of New York'', by a consortium of production companies, it was picked up for U.S. distribution by [[Fine Line Features]]. This result mirrored the film's scrambling of definitions: Fine Line was a subsidiary of New Line, recently merged into the Time Warner empire—specifically, it was the old exploitation distributor's arthouse division.&lt;ref&gt;Mottram (2006), pp. 197–98; Wyatt (1998), p. 78. For details of the film's distribution, see Lewis (2002), pp. 286–88.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), directed by [[Quentin Tarantino]] on a {{Nowrap|$8.5 million}} budget, became a hugely influential hit by crossing multiple lines, as James Mottram describes: "With its art house narrative structure, B-movie subject matter and Hollywood cast, the film is the axis for three distinct cinematic traditions to intersect."&lt;ref&gt;Mottram (2006), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition in the 2000s===
{{Main|B movies since the 1980s}}
By the turn of the millennium, the average production cost of an American feature had already spent three years above the {{Nowrap|$50 million}} mark.&lt;ref name = Bomojo/&gt; In 2005, the top ten movies at the U.S. box office included three adaptations of children's fantasy novels, one extending and another initiating a series (''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' and ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', respectively), a child-targeted cartoon (''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]''), a comic book adaptation (''[[Batman Begins]]''), a sci-fi series installment (''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]''), a sci-fi remake (''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]''), and a ''King Kong'' remake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2005&amp;p=.htm|title=2005 Yearly Box Office Results|publisher=Box Office Mojo|date=|accessdate=2007-01-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070117001752/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2005&amp;p=.htm| archivedate= 17 January 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a slow year for Corman: he produced just one movie, which had no American theatrical release, true of most of the pictures he had been involved in over the preceding decade.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web |author=Rausch, Andrew J.|url=http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue09/features/rogercorman/|title=Roger Corman on ''Blair Witch Project'' and Why ''Mean Streets'' Would Have Made a Great Blaxploitation Film|publisher=Images|year=2000|accessdate=2010-08-13}}{{cite web |author=Saroyan, Strawberry|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3664957/King-of-the-killer-Bs.html|title=King of the Killer B's|work=Telegraph|date=May 6, 2007|accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As big-budget Hollywood movies further usurped traditional low-rent genres, the ongoing viability of the familiar brand of B movie was in grave doubt. ''New York Times'' critic [[A. O. Scott]] warned of the impending "extinction" of "the cheesy, campy, guilty pleasures" of the B picture.&lt;ref&gt;Scott (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Primer Carruth.jpg|thumb|right|250px|B movies are not necessarily "schlock". [[Shane Carruth]] made the sophisticated science fiction film ''[[Primer (film)|Primer]]'' (2004) for $7,000. According to critic Adam Lemke, Carruth's "cramped, claustrophobic [[Mise en scène|mise-en-scene]]" exemplifies a "subtle yet austere visual style that never succumbs to the restrictions of his limited budget".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lemke, Adam |url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDReviews11/primer.htm |title=''Primer'', Directed by Shane Carruth |publisher=DVDBeaver |date= |accessdate=2010-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225201701/http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDReviews11/primer.htm |archivedate=2009-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On the other hand, recent industry trends suggest the reemergence of something like the traditional A-B split in major studio production, though with fewer "programmers" bridging the gap. According to a 2006 report by industry analyst Alfonso Marone, "The average budget for a Hollywood movie is currently around ${{Nowrap|60 m}}, rising to ${{Nowrap|100 m}} when the cost of marketing for domestic launch (USA only) is factored into the equation. However, we are now witnessing a polarisation of film budgets into two tiers: large productions ($120–{{Nowrap|150 m}}) and niche features ($5–20m). ... Fewer $30–{{Nowrap|70 m}} releases are expected."&lt;ref name=Marone&gt;{{cite web|author=Marone, Alfonso |url=http://www.spectrumstrategy.com/Pages/GB/perspectives/Spectrum-The-Hollywood-movie-business.pdf |title=One More Ride on the Hollywood Roller-coaster |publisher=Spectrum Strategy Consultants |year=2006 |accessdate=2006-12-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203004153/http://www.spectrumstrategy.com/Pages/GB/perspectives/Spectrum-The-Hollywood-movie-business.pdf |archivedate=3 February 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox launched a new subsidiary in 2006, [[Fox Atomic]], to concentrate on teen-oriented genre films. The economic model was deliberately low-rent, at least by major studio standards. According to a ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' report, "Fox Atomic is staying at or below the {{Nowrap|$10 million}} mark for many of its movies. It's also encouraging filmmakers to shoot digitally—a cheaper process that results in a grittier, teen-friendly look. And forget about stars. Of Atomic's nine announced films, not one has a big name".&lt;ref&gt;Zeitchik and Laporte (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The newfangled B movie division was shut down in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Fleming, Michael|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002584.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|title=Fox Folding Atomic Label|work=Variety|date=April 19, 2009|accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the ''Variety'' report suggests, recent technological advances greatly facilitate the production of truly low-budget motion pictures. Although there have always been economical means with which to shoot movies, including [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] and [[16&amp;nbsp;mm film]], as well as [[video]] cameras recording onto [[analog signal|analog]] [[videotape]], these mediums could not rival the image quality of [[35&amp;nbsp;mm film]]. The development of [[digital video|digital cameras]] and [[postproduction]] methods now allow even low-budget filmmakers to produce films with excellent, and not necessarily "grittier", image quality and editing effects. As Marone observes, "the equipment budget (camera, support) required for shooting digital is approximately 1/10 that for film, significantly lowering the production budget for independent features. At the same time, [since the early 2000s], the quality of digital filmmaking has improved dramatically."&lt;ref name=Marone/&gt; Independent filmmakers, whether working in a genre or arthouse mode, continue to find it difficult to gain access to distribution channels, though digital end-to-end methods of distribution offer new opportunities. In a similar way, Internet sites such as [[YouTube]] have opened up entirely new avenues for the presentation of low-budget motion pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Rabiger (2008), pp. 7, 10; Davies and Wistreich (2007), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated terms==
The terms ''C movie'' and the more common ''Z movie'' describe progressively lower grades of the B movie category. The terms ''[[drive-in movie]]'' and ''[[midnight movie]]'', which emerged in association with specific historical phenomena, are now often used as synonyms for ''B movie''.

===C movie===
The '''C movie''' is the grade of motion picture at the low end of the B movie, or—in some taxonomies—simply below it.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Komiya and Litman (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, with the growth of [[cable television]], the C grade began to be applied with increasing frequency to low-quality genre films used as filler programming for that market. The "C" in the term then does double duty, referring not only to quality that is lower than "B" but also to the initial ''c'' of ''cable.'' Helping to popularize the notion of the C movie was the TV series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' (1988–99), which ran on national cable channels (first [[Comedy Central]], then the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]]) after its first year. Updating a concept introduced by TV hostess [[Maila Nurmi|Vampira]] over three decades before, ''MST3K'' presented cheap, low-grade movies, primarily science fiction of the 1950s and 1960s, along with running voiceover commentary highlighting the films' shortcomings. Director [[Ed Wood]] has been called "the master of the 'C-movie{{'"}} in this sense, although ''Z movie'' (see below) is perhaps even more applicable to his work.&lt;ref&gt;Oppermann (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid expansion of niche cable and satellite outlets such as Sci Fi (with its [[Sci Fi Pictures original films|Sci Fi Pictures]]) and [[HBO]]'s genre channels in the 1990s and 2000s has meant a market for contemporary C pictures, many of them "direct to cable" movies—small budget genre films never released in theaters.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web |author=Campos, Eric|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=interviews&amp;Id=924&amp;archive=Date&amp;match=0&amp;page=2|title=David Payne: Do Fear the Reeker|publisher=Film Threat|date=December 12, 2005|accessdate=2006-10-20| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070310204706/http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=interviews&amp;Id=924&amp;archive=Date&amp;match=0&amp;page=2| archivedate = March 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Plan 9 Alternative poster.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Often called "the worst film ever made", [[Ed Wood]]'s ultra-low-budget ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959) has become the most famous of all [[Z movie]]s.]]

===Z movie===
{{Main|Z movie}}
The term '''Z movie''' (or '''grade-Z movie''') is used by some to characterize low-budget pictures with quality standards well below those of most B and even C movies. Most films referred to as Z movies are made on very small budgets by operations on the fringes of the commercial film industry. The micro-budget "quickies" of 1930s fly-by-night [[Poverty Row]] production houses may be thought of as Z movies ''[[wikt:avant la lettre|avant la lettre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Taves (1995), p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; The films of director Ed Wood, such as ''[[Glen or Glenda]]'' (1953) and ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959)—frequently cited as one of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst pictures ever made]]—exemplify the classic grade-Z movie. Latter-day Zs are often characterized by violent, gory or sexual content and a minimum of artistic interest; much of which is destined for the [[Pay television|subscription TV]] equivalent of the grindhouse.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Quarles (2001), pp. 79–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychotronic movie===
'''Psychotronic movie''' is a term coined by film critic Michael J. Weldon—referred to by a fellow critic as "the historian of marginal movies"—to denote the sort of low-budget genre pictures that are generally disdained or ignored entirely by the critical establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McDonagh, Maitland |url=http://community.tvguide.com/thread.jspa?threadID=700004011 |title=Sad News: ''Psychotronic Video'' Magazine Gives Up the Ghost |publisher=TVGuide.com |date=July 17, 2006 |accessdate=2006-12-26 |archiveurl=https://archive.li/20071012143202/http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Ask-Flickchick/Sad-News-Psychotronic/700004011|archivedate=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weldon's immediate source for the term was the Chicago cult film ''[[The Psychotronic Man]]'' (1980), whose title character is a barber who develops the ability to kill using psychic energy. According to Weldon, "My original idea with that word is that it's a two-part word. 'Psycho' stands for the horror movies, and 'tronic' stands for the science fiction movies. I very quickly expanded the meaning of the word to include any kind of exploitation or B-movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ignizio, Bob|url=http://www.uttertrash.net/michaelweldon.htm|title=The Psychotronic Man (interview with Michael Weldon)|publisher=Utter Trash|date=April 20, 2006|accessdate=2006-10-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060911034834/http://www.uttertrash.net/michaelweldon.htm| archivedate= 11 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term, popularized beginning in the 1980s with publications of Weldon's such as ''The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film'' and ''[[Psychotronic Video]]'' magazine, has subsequently been adopted by other critics and fans. Use of the term tends to emphasize a focus on and affection for those B movies that lend themselves to appreciation as [[camp (style)|camp]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Schneider and Williams (2005), pp. 2, 5; Syder and Tierney (2005), pp. 34–35, 50–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===B-television===
{{Main|B-television}}
'''B-television''' is the term used by the German media scholar [[:de:Heidemarie Schumacher|Heidemarie Schumacher]] in his article ''From the True, the Good, the Beautiful to the Truly Beautiful Goods—audience identification strategies on German "B-Television" programs'' as an analogy to "B-movie" to characterize the development of German [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial]] television, which adopted "the aesthetics of commercials" with its "inane positiveness radiated by every participant, the inclusion of clips, soft focus, catchy music" as well as "promotion of merchandise through product placement".&lt;ref name="Schumacher1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://monoskop.org/images/6/64/New_German_Critique_No_78_Special_Issue_on_German_Media_Studies_1999.pdf|title=From the True, the Good, the Beautiful to the Truly Beautiful Goods—audience identification strategies on German "B-Television" programs|publisher=Schüren Verlag, Marburg|first=Heidemarie|last=Schumacher|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumacher notes that after 1984 deregulation German public television passed its climax and became marginalized. Newly established commercial stations, operating without the burden of societal legitimacy, focused solely on profitability. To establish and maintain viewer loyalty these stations would broadcast reality shows, sensational journalism, daily soap operas, infotainment programs, talk shows, game shows and soft pornography.

"Appeals to viewer emotions and the active participation of the consumer enhance the ability of 'B-TV' to exploit the market", concludes Schumacher.

'''Chatur Singhji''', also known as Bavji Chatur Singhji, was born on 9 February 1880 (V. S. Magh Krishn 14, 1936) at Karjali Haveli to Rani Krishna Kunwar and Maharaj Surat Singh of Karjali. He was a popular people’s saint-poet of Rajputana, now [[Rajasthan]], India, who was an accomplished yogi also and is remembered as [[Patanjali]] and [[Valmiki]] of Rajasthan.&lt;ref&gt;Kanhaiyalal Rajpurohit, Bavji Chtur Singhji - Rajasthani Writer, 1996, page 96, {{ISBN|81-260-0163-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Lifetime ==

=== Birth and family ===
Chatur Singhji was born on 9 February 1880 (V. S. Magh Krishn 14, 1936) at Karjali Haveli to Rani Krishna Kunwar and Maharaj Surat Singh of Karjali. The Karjali family descend from Maharaj Bagh Singh, the third son of Maharana Sangram Singh II of Mewar ([[Udaipur]]. Chatur Singhji was youngest of four brothers. Bavji married at the age of 19 years and had two daughters, one died as a child while the other Sayar Kunwar was married to Maharaj Hamir Singhji of Vijaynagar, Gujarat.&lt;ref&gt;Motilal Menariya (2012). Mewad ki Vibhutiyan, Himanshu Publications, Udaipur &amp; New Delhi, 7th Ed, 169p. {{ISBN|978-81-7906-298-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poet and social reformer ===
Singhji was a popular people’s saint-poet of Rajputana, now Rajasthan, India, who was an accomplished yogi also and is remembered as Patanjali and Valmiki of Rajasthan.

Bavji spread the ancient Indian knowledge through a simple language that a lay man could comprehend which helped him in his mission for social reform, but with preservation of Rajasthan’s culture and heritage. He effectively propagated promotion of education through "''Ramat-Bhanat''" concept (रमत-भणत् य़ोजना what is now popular as play-way child education). For his adult education and literacy mission, Bavji spread the concept of "''Seekho-Kamao-Khao''" सीखो-कमाओ-खाओ –"Learn-Earn-Sustain" (an earlier example of earn-while-you-learn concept, but the significance of the third component of "Sustain/Maintain" is now being realized after the Global Economic Meltdown of 2008). Bavji was strong advocate of imparting education to all the children/uneducated adults in their own mother tongue, for which he wrote easy to understand booklets too, they should be adopted for promotion of education in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Maharaj Chatur Singhji Bavji (1949). Balka Ri Pothee, Part-I. Shree Mewad Printing Press, Udaipur, 2nd Edition. 24p&lt;/ref&gt;

== Residences and death ==
Singhji lived during the reign of Maharana Fateh Singh (reign 1884-1930), who was his uncle. The death of his wife in 1907 and then his daughter, without issue, one year after her marriage drove him further towards spiritual pursuits. He moved from the Karjali Haveli in Udaipur to Telion-ki-Sarai, where the present-day BN College is located, and then to a modest cottage (KOTRI) on Hawa Magri at Sukher. He later moved to the other Karjali thikana village of Nauwa.

Singhji died at Karjali Haveli on 1 July 1929, aged 49, following a brief illness.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

== Publications ==

Bavji propagated the spiritual and social reformist knowledge of humanity in mother tongue of the local public (Rajasthan) and wrote both prose and poetry. His major works during the short span of about seven years (1922–1929) are given below :

== Legacy ==
The Academy for Rajasthani Language, Literature, &amp; Culture has instituted an annual award in honour of Singhji. Known as the Bavji Chatur Singhji Anuvaad Puruskaar (Bavji Chatur Singhji Translation Award) it is given for translation of worthy literary work into the Rajasthani language. It has a monetary value of Rs. 30,000.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Maharana Bhagwat Singhji Mewad (reign 1955-1984) republished Bavji’s major literary works during his birth centenary year (1980) and set up a room in Bavji's honour in the City Palace Museum, Udaipur.

The spiritual journal ''Kalyan'''' published special issues on BHAGTA-ANK (1928) and YOGANK (1935) in which Bavji’s literature, philosophy, and contributions were discussed.

The Rajasthani writer and social activist [[Lakshmi Kumari Chundawat]] dedicated her book ''Moomal'' (1961) to Bavji Chatur Singhji.&lt;ref&gt;Lakshmi Kumari Chundawat (1961). Moomal (in Rajasthani) First Edition, National Printers, Jaipur. 102 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bavji’s kotri at Khaanu Mangri was opened by Niranjan Nath Acharya, the then Speaker of Rajasthan Legislative Assembly, on 13 January 1966 after restoration supported by the Maharana Mewar Foundation and Karjali family. Every year on V.S. PAUSH SUKL 3 (~January) a fair and spiritual event is held at Nauwa to commemorate the Enlightenment Day (ATM SHAKSHAATKAAR) of Maharaj Chatur Singhji.

The '''Bell System Technical Journal''' was a periodical publication by the [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] (AT&amp;T) in New York devoted to the scientific and engineering aspects of electrical communication.&lt;ref name=issue1&gt;''Bell System Technical Journal'', Vol. 1, No. 1, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; It was published under this name from 1922 until 1983, when the [[breakup of the Bell System]] placed various parts of the system into separate companies.

After the restructuring of the Bell Laboratories in 1984, the Bell System Technical Journal was renamed to ''AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories Technical Journal''.  From 1985 to 1996 it was published under the title ''AT&amp;T Technical Journal''.

In 1996, the journal was revamped under the name '''Bell Labs Technical Journal''' as the in-house [[scientific journal]] for scientists of [[Nokia Bell Labs]], and is published yearly by the [[IEEE]] society.

==History==
The Bell System Technical Journal was published by AT&amp;T in New York City through its Information Department, in behalf of [[Western Electric Company]] and the Associated Companies of the Bell System.&lt;ref name=issue1 /&gt; The first issue was released in July 1922, under the editorship of R.W. King and an eight-member editorial board. From 1922 to 1951, the publication schedule was quarterly. It was bimonthly until 1964, and finally produced ten monthly issues per year until the end of 1983, combining the four summer months into two issues in May and July.

Publication of the journal under the name ''Bell System Technical Journal'' ended with Volume 62 by the end of 1983, because of the divestiture of AT&amp;T. Under new organization, publication continued as ''AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories Technical Journal'' in 1984 with Volume 63, maintaining the volume sequence numbers established since 1922. In 1985, ''Bell Laboratories'' was removed from the title to ''AT&amp;T Technical Journal'' until 1995 (Volume 74).

In 1996, the title was changed to ''Bell Labs Technical Journal'', and publication management was transferred to Wiley Periodicals, Inc., establishing a new volume sequence (Volume 1).

==Notable papers==
* In 1928, [[Clinton Joseph Davisson]] published a paper on electron diffraction by nickel crystal, thus unambiguously establishing the wave nature of electron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davisson|first=Clinton J.|title=The Diffraction of Electrons by a Crystal of Nickel|journal=Bell System Technical Journal|date=January 1928|pages=90–105, |url=http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol07-1928/articles/bstj7-1-90.pdf|accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery led to a widespread acceptance of particle-wave duality of matter and won him the 1937 Nobel Prize in Physics.
* [[Claude Shannon]]'s paper "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]", which founded the field of [[information theory]], was published as two-part article in July and October issue of 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shannon|first=Claude E.|title=A mathematical theory of communication|journal=Bell System Technical Journal|date=July 1948|pages=27:379–423|url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pdf|accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shannon|first=Claude E.|title=A mathematical theory of communication|journal=Bell System Technical Journal|date=October 1948|pages=623–656, |url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pdf|accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many landmark papers from the developers of [[Unix]] appeared in a themed issue in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ritchie|first=D.M.|author2=K. Thompson|title=The UNIX Time-Sharing System|journal=Bell System Technical Journal|date=July–August 1978|volume=57|issue=6|url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/cacm.html|accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The journal is notorious for numerous articles disclosing the internal operation of the long-distance switching system used in [[direct distance dialing]] (DDD) in the Bell System in the 1950s and 1960s. Articles such as those by A.Weaver and N.A. Newel (''In-Band Single-Frequency Signaling''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weaver|first=A.|author2=N. A. Newell|title=In-Band Single-Frequency Signaling|year=1954|volume=33|issue=6|url=http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol33-1954/articles/bstj33-6-1309.pdf|accessdate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and by C. Breen and C.A. Dahlbom (''Signaling Systems for Control of Telephone Switching'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Breen|first=C.|last2=Dahlbom|first2=C. A.|title=Signaling Systems for Control of Telephone Switching|journal=Bell System Technical Journal|volume=XXXIX|issue=6|pages=1381–1444|url=http://www.historyofphonephreaking.org/docs/breen1960.pdf|doi=10.1002/j.1538-7305.1960.tb01611.x|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabled [[phone phreak]]s to develop the [[blue box]] apparatus, which mimicked the switching system's signals to allow them to make free long-distance calls.
* The 2009 Nobel Prize physicists [[Willard Boyle]] and [[George E. Smith]] described their new [[charge-coupled device]] in the journal in a 1970 paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol49-1970/articles/bstj49-4-587.pdf "Charge coupled semiconductor devices."] ''Bell System Technical Journal'', 49(4): 587-93, April 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bench-clearing brawl''', sometimes known as a '''basebrawl''' or a '''rhubarb''', is a form of ritualistic fighting that occurs in sports, most notably [[baseball]] and [[ice hockey]], in which every player on both teams leave their [[Dugout (baseball)|dugout]]s, [[bullpen]]s or benches, and charge the playing area in order to fight one another or try to break up a fight.

==Baseball==
[[File:Massive fenway brawl.jpg|thumb|Bench-clearing brawl at [[Fenway Park]] because of [[Coco Crisp]] getting hit by a pitch by [[James Shields (baseball)|James Shields]].]]
In [[baseball]], brawls are usually the result of escalating infractions, often stemming from a player being [[Hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]], or an altercation between a [[baserunner]] and [[infielder]] stemming from excessive contact in an attempted [[tag out]] (such as a runner crashing into the [[catcher (baseball)|catcher]] at home plate in an attempt to dislodge the ball, which is an [[interference (baseball)|offensive interference]] violation that may result in ejection). They are also known to occur when a batter [[charging the mound|charges the mound]]. However, few bench-clearing brawls result in serious injury, as in most cases, no punches are thrown, and the action is limited to pushing and shoving.

Unlike most other team sports, in which teams usually have an equivalent number of players on the field at any given time, in baseball the hitting team is at a numerical disadvantage, with a maximum of five players (batter, up to three runners, and on-deck batter) and two base coaches on the field at any time, compared to the fielding team's nine players. For this reason, leaving the dugout to join a fight is generally considered acceptable in that it results in numerical equivalence on the field, a fairer fight, and a generally neutral outcome, as in most cases, managers and/or umpires will intervene to restore order and resume the game. In at least one case (the infamous [[Ten Cent Beer Night]] promotion), one team (the Cleveland Indians, who were the home team) left its dugout to defend the other (the Texas Rangers, the visiting team) from its own fans (who had [[pitch invasion|stormed the field]]). 

===Penalty===
Depending on the severity of the [[unsportsmanlike conduct]], an [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] may or may not [[ejection (sports)|eject]] a brawl's participants. Since a bench-clearing brawl by definition involves ''everyone'' on both teams, it is exceedingly unlikely that all participants will be ejected, but the player or players responsible for the precipitating event are often ejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2011/Official_Baseball_Rules.pdf|work=Major League Baseball|title=The Official Baseball Rules|accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fines and suspensions generally result and are issued at a later date.

==Ice hockey==
[[File:ThorntonfightingBrookbank.jpg|thumb|[[Shawn Thornton]] fighting [[Wade Brookbank]].]]

[[Fighting in ice hockey]] by [[enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcers]] is an established, if unofficial, part of the sport (especially in [[North America]], where the penalty rules are more permissive); the general procedure in a one-on-one fight is to let it pan out and then send both players to the [[penalty box]] with five-minute [[Major penalty|major penalties]]. Escalations beyond isolated fights, such as line brawls between groups of players on the ice, are [[violence in ice hockey|prohibited]], meaning bench-clearing brawls will result in serious consequences. General brawls can result in players being assessed [[game misconduct]] penalties and [[ejection (sports)|ejected]] from the game. This is especially the case if a player leaves the bench or [[penalty box]] to join a fight.

As in baseball, hockey brawls usually result from escalating infractions; in this case, dangerous hits, excessive post-whistle roughness, taking shots after the whistle, attacking the [[goaltender]], and hatred from competition in a game with a significant amount of inter-player violence, all contribute to bench-clearing brawls.

In the [[National Hockey League]] the penalties include, in addition to in-game penalties, an automatic 10-game suspension and a fine of $10,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26481 ''Rule 70.10&amp;nbsp;– Leaving the Players' or Penalty Bench''] in the NHL Rulebook&lt;/ref&gt; for the first player to leave his bench or the penalty box to participate in a brawl; for the second player to leave his bench or the penalty box, the penalties include, in addition to in-game penalties, an automatic five-game suspension and a fine of $5,000.

The [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] rules prescribe a double minor penalty plus a game misconduct penalty for the first player to leave the bench during an altercation and a misconduct penalty for other such players;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/sport/iihf-rule-book.html IIHF Rule Book 2006–2010], Rule 564&amp;nbsp;– Players Leaving the Benches During an Altercation, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; a player who leaves the penalty box during an altercation is assessed a minor penalty plus a game misconduct penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/sport/iihf-rule-book.html IIHF Rule Book 2006–2010], Rule 563&amp;nbsp;– Players Leaving the Penalty Bench, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these penalties for leaving the bench, all players engaging in a fight may be penalized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/sport/iihf-rule-book.html IIHF Rule Book 2006–2010], Rule 528&amp;nbsp;– Fisticuffs or Roughing, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more notable incidents was the [[Punch-up in Piestany]], a game between Canada and the Soviet Union during the [[1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]]. The game was rougher and more dangerous than is generally accepted, and with 6:07 left in the second period, a wild fight broke out between Pavel Kostichkin and [[Theoren Fleury]], causing both teams to leave the benches for 20 minutes. The officials ordered that the arena lights be turned out, but to no avail, and the [[IIHF]] eventually declared the game void. Both teams were ejected from the tournament, costing Canada a potential gold medal, and the Canadian team, disgusted at what they perceived to be a conspiracy against them, chose to leave rather than stay for the end-of-tournament festivities, from which the Soviet team were banned.

A notable [[KHL]] bench-clearing brawl saw all the players of [[Avangard Omsk]] and [[Vityaz Chekhov]], except for the goaltenders, fighting at 3 minutes and 34 seconds. The referees penalized all the players who were involved in the brawl, and called the game due to lack of players; the teams were fined 5.7 million [[Russian ruble|rubles]] and had the game counted as a double loss.

==Other sports==
Bench-clearing brawls have also been known to occur in other sports, and officials in those sports have been cracking down on such brawls; in 1995, the [[National Basketball Association]] changed the penalty for leaving the bench to participate in a brawl from a $500 fine to an automatic one-game suspension.

In 2010, the [[Northern Territory Football League]] in Australia ruled that any player found to have left the interchange bench to participate in a melee would be ejected from that match; they would also have their melee fine increased by 25% and receive an automatic one-game suspension.

Bench-clearing brawls do not occur very often in [[gridiron football]]. All levels of the game penalize any "substitute who leaves the team box during a fight" (as it is worded in the high school rule books) with automatic ejection and possible further sanctions depending on the league, and the amount of equipment a football player wears increases the risk for injury in a brawl greatly. In addition, on-field umpires and referees move in immediately to break up fights, and any contact by a team member against an official will draw the immediate penalty of ejection from the game, with further sanctions by league officials virtually certain, along with [[Penalty (gridiron football)#List of penalties|on-field penalties]] that move the ball closer or farther from the goal line depending on the team sanctioned, hurting the team's winning chances far more than in other sports. One notable brawl at the college level was [[FIU–Miami football brawl|between Florida International University and the University of Miami]], where tough talk between two [[crosstown rivalry|crosstown rivals]] escalated into a brawl with severe consequences for FIU.

At least two bench-clearing brawls have taken place in the Lingerie Football League, since renamed the [[Legends Football League]]. The first came in 2009 between the [[Miami Caliente]] and the [[New York Majesty]]; that brawl eventually led to the Majesty suspending operations. Another occurred during the December 9, 2011 LFL game between the [[Toronto Triumph]] and the [[Philadelphia Passion]]. It was unclear what punishment either team would face as Toronto was already using [[replacement player]]s due to a mass walkout of the original team earlier in the year.

===High school and scholastic sports===
Bench-clearing brawls are prohibited in scholastic competition with the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] specifying the penalty for leaving the bench area to participate in a fight in any sanctioned sport as an automatic [[ejection (sports)|ejection]] and, if actively involved in a fight, an automatic [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]]. In addition, school administrators may implement more severe penalties such as disqualification from activities, academic suspension or [[Expulsion (education)|expulsion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.nfhs.org/vango/custom/resourcelibrary/|title=NFHS Resource Library|work=National Federation of State High School Associations|accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more severe instances, entire schools can face sanctions from their state's athletic association, ranging from letters of reprimand, forfeiture of contests, withholding of travel expenses and extended suspensions of players and coaches to, in the most severe cases, cancellation of a team's entire season or suspension of a school's entire athletic program.

In [[medicine]], a '''bleb''' is a [[blister]] (often hemispherical) filled with [[serous fluid]]. Blebs can form in a number of tissues due to different pathologies, including [[frostbite|frostbitten]] tissues, and as a cause of spontaneous [[pneumothorax]]. 

In pathology [[pulmonary blebs]] are small subpleural thin walled air containing spaces, not larger than 1-2 cm in diameter. Their walls are less than 1 mm thick. If they rupture, they allow air to escape into pleural space resulting in a spontaneous pneumothorax.

In [[ophthalmology]], blebs may be formed intentionally in the treatment of [[glaucoma]]. In such treatments, functional blebs facilitate the circulation of [[Aqueous humour|aqueous humor]], the blockage of which will lead to increase in eye pressure. Use of collagen matrix wound modulation device such as ologen during glaucoma surgery is known to produce vascular and functional blebs, which are positively correlated with treatment success rate. &lt;ref&gt;1.Yuan F, Li L, Chen X, Yan X, Wang L (2015).

Ultrasound biomicroscopy and optical coherence tomography imaging of filtering blebs after deep sclerectomy with new collagen implant. Eur J Ophthalmol. 19(2):223-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lungs, a bleb is a collection of air within the layers of the [[visceral pleura]]. 

In breasts a bleb is a milk blister (also known as blocked nipple pore, nipple blister, or “milk under the skin”).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/bfinfo/white-spot-nipple White spot on the nipple]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1857">{{Other uses|Boss (disambiguation){{!}}Boss}}

In [[engineering]], a '''boss''' is a protruding feature on a work piece. A common use for a boss is to locate one object within a pocket or hole of another object. For instance, some [[Engine|motors]] use a precisely machined boss on the front face to locate it on the mating part. Like a [[process (anatomy)|process]] on a bone, bosses on [[casting]]s can provide attachment points or [[bearing surface]]s.

The term 'boss' when used in engineering can also relate to a finishing edge around (usually) a circular opening that allows the opening to locate onto, or within another opening thus locating or joining two items together with a view to the location or joining being temporary or semi-permanent.
A common everyday example of a boss is the housing of the rotation spindle in a washing machine drum, or on a cylinder lawn mower at the end of the cutting blade cylinder which may house a bearing set to allow the cylinder to rotate through one plane, but held firm in another plane.

A boss can also be a brass eyelet on a sail. It is a generic term to describe an item designed to facilitate the use with, within, on or around another item whereby one cannot operate properly without the other.

The word 'boss' is also often used to describe the end of a shaft on a boat to which a propeller might attach.

A boss may also refer to a mounting feature that will receive a screw or thread-forming screw.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In [[computer-aided design]] applications, a boss is a feature used to describe a type of [[extrusion]].

The word boss comes from the Middle French word ''embocer'', which means protuberance.

Her literary work, mainly written in German, covers romantic stories about the legendary feats of [[hajduk]] heroes. They brought her commercial success in both [[German-speaking Europe]] and Romania, and were prefaced by [[List of Romanian consorts|Queen-consort]] [[Elisabeth of Wied]].

Dumbravă promoted many causes, and was involved with several cultural projects, but is mainly remembered for her activity in promoting tourism and [[environmentalism]] in Romania. She was an avid traveler and mountaineer, who established some of the country's first hiking clubs. Her [[travel writing]] remains a standard in [[Romanian literature]], even though her fiction work is generally forgotten.

Throughout most of her career, Szekulics promoted the inclusion of women in the [[Freemasonry in Romania|Romanian Freemasonry]]. In old age, her essays came to focus on [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]] subjects, and, as disciple of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], set up the Romanian lodge of the [[Theosophical Society]]. She died on her return trip from the [[British Raj]], having attended the Theosophical Conference in [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
The future writer was born in the city of [[Bratislava]] (''Pressburg''). Her father was either [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Hungaro-Slovak]]&lt;ref name="lmescal29"&gt;Marinescu, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Slovaks in Hungary|Slovak-Hungarian]].&lt;ref name="uwbrentanos47"/&gt; On her mother's side, she was [[Ethnic Germans|ethnic German]].&lt;ref name="uwbrentanos47"&gt;{{de icon}} Ursula Wittstock, [http://www.studia.ubbcluj.ro/download/pdf/279.pdf "Zur Deutung der Rumänischen Verse in Clemens Brentanos Novelle 'Die Mehrern Wehmüller und Ungarischen Nationalgesichter' "], in the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] ''Studia. Philologia 1'', Vol. LII, 2007, p.47&lt;/ref&gt; Dumbravă herself was raised into [[German culture]], and therefore perceived as a German.&lt;ref&gt;Tăslăuanu, p.326-327&lt;/ref&gt; Fanny spent her earliest childhood moving between the various parts of [[Austria-Hungary]], visiting [[Vienna]] at age 4.&lt;ref name="lmescal29"/&gt; A year later, her family had emigrated to the [[Kingdom of Romania]], as friends of the [[King of Romania|Romanian King]], [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]].&lt;ref name="lmescal29"/&gt; Her father worked as an insurance executive, and is credited by some historians with being supervisor of the [[Masonic Lodge]] ''zur Brüderlichkeit''.&lt;ref name="crbteoz"/&gt;

The royal family soon took notice of Fanny's piano-playing, of her talent for writing German-language poetry, and of her passion for reading Romanian romantic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Marinescu, p.29, 30&lt;/ref&gt; At the court in [[Sinaia]], she became a confidant and [[lady-in-waiting]]&lt;ref name="crbteoz"/&gt; of Queen Elisabeth and, in July 1884, made her entry into high society as a guest of the royal couple.&lt;ref name="lmescal29"/&gt;

In 1886, Fanny Szekulics became a philanthropist and social activist, founding Tibișoiul Society and providing [[Sunday school]] for lower-class children.&lt;ref name="lmescal29"/&gt; In later years, she was mainly active as a music critic, art promoter, researcher at the [[Romanian Academy]] and lecturer on religious subjects, working with sculptor [[Carol Storck]] and musicologist [[Ion Popescu-Pasărea]].&lt;ref&gt;''Boabe de Grâu'', October 1934, p.633, 634&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, she established, together with politician [[Vintilă Brătianu]], Chindia Society, for the preservation and cultivation of [[Romanian folklore]], specifically folk dances. She was joined there by socialite Frozy Nenițescu, who recalled that, at least originally, the society fought against oriental influences in [[Romanian dress]] and shunned the "noise-making" ''[[Taraf (musical band)|tarafuri]]'', and was in turn criticized for its "exclusivity".&lt;ref&gt;''Boabe de Grâu'', October 1934, p.634. See also Marinescu, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; Their work was documented in a 1913 film by Nicolae Barbelian, which commits to cultural memory ten individual national dances taught at Chindia.&lt;ref&gt;Marinescu, p.29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Fanny followed her father's Masonic beliefs and joined into the controversial [[Co-Freemasonry|"Rites of Adoption" Masonry]]. She corresponded with [[Annie Besant]] and ''[[Le Droit Humain]]'', becoming recognized as Diva of the Rosy Cross 9th Degree, and probably used the Chindia group in the recruitment of new members.&lt;ref name="crbteoz"/&gt;

===Literary debut===
Szekulics' first published volume is ''Der Haiduck'' ("The Hajduk"), printed by W. Wunderling of [[Regensburg]] in 1908. The same year, translated by Teodor Nica, it saw print with Carol Sfetea of [[Bucharest]], as ''Haiducul'' (second edition and third, 1911; fourth edition, 1914).&lt;ref name="lmescal30, 35"&gt;Marinescu, p.30, 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al194"&gt;Tamara Teodorescu, Rodica Fochi, Florența Sădeanu, Liana Miclescu, Lucreția Angheluță, ''Bibliografia românească modernă (1831-1918). Vol. II: D-K'', [[Editura științifică și enciclopedică]], Bucharest, 1986, p.194.  {{OCLC|462172635}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudonymous, the book enjoyed the allure of mystery, and some assumed that it was in fact a literary attempt by Queen Elisabeth.&lt;ref&gt;Marinescu, p.28; Montandon, p.350&lt;/ref&gt; The latter had in fact suggested Szekulics' pen name, which echoes the mountainous surroundings of Sinaia: [[Lake Bucura]] and the common noun ''dumbravă'' ("grove").&lt;ref&gt;Marinescu, p.28, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[historical novel]], ''Der Haiduck'' was described in ''[[Mercure de France]]'' as a fresco of "Romania's first patriots", with an "entrapping subject matter" and a "perfectly adequate sobriety" of tone.&lt;ref&gt;Montandon, p.351-352&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Transylvania]], critic [[Ilarie Chendi]] reported being pleasantly surprised by both the book and the good reception it received in [[German Empire|Germany]]. According to Chendi, the work was notable for its sympathetic depiction of the Romanian peasants, with their "clean and ancient way of life".&lt;ref name="icdari2140215"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ilarie Chendi]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/luceafarul/1911/BCUCLUJ_FP_280091_1911_010_009.pdf "Dări de seamă"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 9/1911, p.214-215 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; Critics were drawn to Szekulics' minute historical research, which included the verification of historical records in the [[Hurmuzachi brothers|Hurmuzachi]] collection,&lt;ref name="crbteoz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marinescu, p.31; Montandon, p.351-352&lt;/ref&gt; but also inspiration from the popular novels of [[N. D. Popescu-Popnedea]].&lt;ref name="icdari2140215"/&gt; More controversially, she borrowed heavily from a family manuscript on hajduk [[Iancu Jianu]], and was therefore suspected of [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref name="lmescal31"&gt;Marinescu, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; The work was also criticized for perpetuating the negative myth of Nikola Abraš (or "Iabraș"), Jianu's main ally, as a traitor to the hajduk insurgency.&lt;ref name="siabraš683"&gt;S. Iancovici, "Iancu Jianu și Nikola Abraš", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Nr. 4/1967, p.683&lt;/ref&gt;

''Der Haiduck'' came out a second time, in 1912, with a foreword by Elisabeth (signed with her pen name, ''Carmen Sylva'').&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al194"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marinescu, p.34, 35&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Dumbravă completed her "history of the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821]]", as ''Der Pandur'' ("The [[Vladimirescu's Pandurs|Pandur]]"). It too was published by Wunderling in Germany, and, in [[Eliza Brătianu]]'s translation, by Carol Sfetea,&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al194"/&gt; before being entirely redone in Romanian by the author herself.&lt;ref name="lmescal31"/&gt; The narrative centers on the folk hero [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], depicted as the impersonation of [[National awakening of Romania|national awakening]], but also as a ruthless commander and a blunt politician.&lt;ref&gt;Tăslăuanu, p.326&lt;/ref&gt;

''Der Pandur'' was a [[sequel]] to ''Der Haiduck''. The final part of this trilogy, focusing on the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848]], was burned, by accident, before it could be published.&lt;ref name="lmescal30"&gt;Marinescu, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; Dumbravă never returned to it, but, by 1918, was conceiving of another novel, tentatively called ''Book of [[Sibyl]]''.&lt;ref name="lmescal30"/&gt; She still registered success as an amateur musician. In 1913, at Elisabeth's [[Peleș Castle]], her piano-playing accompanied famous the Romanian violinists [[George Enescu]] and [[Dimitrie Dinicu]].&lt;ref&gt;Marinescu, p.30-31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hiker and philanthropist===
During those decades, the friendship between Dumbravă and Queen Elisabeth centered on their shared interest for hiking through the [[Southern Carpathians]], to and from Sinaia. For Dumbravă, traveling was already a weekly pastime. As recalled by witnesses of these escapades, the physically unattractive and myopic Dumbravă was much admired for her joyful spirit and her adventure-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;''Boabe de Grâu'', October 1934, p.632-633, 634-635&lt;/ref&gt; She wore tailor-made mountaineer's clothes, rode a "famous mare" named Liza, and set up her main camp at the [[Ialomiței caves]].&lt;ref&gt;''Boabe de Grâu'', October 1934, p.634-635; Marinescu, p.32-33&lt;/ref&gt; According to Frozy Nenițescu, Dumbravă also took political risks, crossing back into Austria-Hungary, and irritating the [[Hungarian Border Guard]] officials with her presence.&lt;ref name="bdgoct34-635"&gt;''Boabe de Grâu'', October 1934, p.635&lt;/ref&gt;

With the discovery of this passion, Szekulics turned her attention to [[travel literature]]. According to comparatist Luiza Marinescu, her subsequent work should be regarded as fitting in with the Romanian tradition of "descriptive romantic literature" ([[Alexandru Odobescu]], [[Alexandru Vlahuță]], [[Calistrat Hogaș]], [[Nicolae Iorga]]), but also as informing the German public about "Romanian specificity".&lt;ref&gt;Marinescu, p.27, 31&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, critic [[Mihail Dragomirescu]] suggests, Szekulics was a disciple of the ''[[Junimea]]'' society. Himself a member of ''Junimea'', Dragomirescu places the female novelist among the authors illustrating the [[Neoromanticism|neoromantic]] "national ideal" literature promoted, ca. 1900, by cultural theorist [[Titu Maiorescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Dragomirescu, p.34, 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1914, Fanny Szekulics was helping with Queen Elisabeth's charities, a member of the "Ladies' Committee" at the Queen Elisabeth Polyclinic, Bucharest, and a co-manager of Țesătoarea Career School.&lt;ref&gt;''Tout-Bucarest. Almanach du high life de l'Indépendance Roumaine'', Independența, Bucharest, 1914, p.151-152&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Mărgărita Miller Verghy]], [[Izabela Sadoveanu-Evan]] and other women writers, Sadoveanu was also a founding member of the ''Româncele Cercetașe'' Association, an early branch of [[Scouting and Guiding in Romania|Romanian Scouting]], and, in this respect, predecessor the ''[[Asociația Ghidelor și Ghizilor din România]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Lucian Nastasă, [http://www.history-cluj.ro/Istorie/cercet/Nastasa/IntimitateaAmfiteatrelor.pdf ''Intimitatea amfiteatrelor. Ipostaze din viața privată a universitarilor "literari" (1864-1948)''], [[Editura Limes]], Cluj-Napoca, 2010, p.234.  {{ISBN|978-973-726-469-5}}; [[e-book]] version at the [[Romanian Academy]] George Bariț Institute of History&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, Carol I died, leaving Elisabeth a widow. Reportedly, Dumbravă was able to revive her friend's interest in hiking and literature even after this incident,&lt;ref name="bdgoct34-633"&gt;''Boabe de Grâu'', October 1934, p.633&lt;/ref&gt; and, together with the queen, began work on a book of meditation, the never-completed ''Cartea Îngerilor'' ("Book of Angels").&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, p.295-296&lt;/ref&gt; She delivered one of Elisabeth's funeral orations upon her death in November 1916.&lt;ref name="bdgoct34-633"/&gt;

===''Cartea munților'' and Touring Club===
Fanny Szekulics resumed her activity after [[World War I]]. While new editions of ''Haiducul'' came out in 1919 and 1925, Dumbravă put out editions of her best-selling new essays: ''Cartea munților'' ("The Book of the Mountains") and ''Ceasuri sfinte'' ("Holy Hours").&lt;ref name="lmescal30, 35"/&gt; Her first works to be written directly in Romanian, they consolidated her reputation among conservatives and monarchists. According to M. Dragomirescu: "''Cartea munților'' [is] a masterpiece of sound Romanian inspiration and healthy language [...]. Therein is so much love of nature, so much intimacy with the mountains' godly beauties, [...] that it is, without doubt, one of the best works in our literature."&lt;ref&gt;Dragomirescu, p.43-44&lt;/ref&gt; At the traditionalist review ''Transilvania'', literary chronicler Ion Georgescu upheld ''Ceasuri sfinte'' as the antithesis of [[modernist literature]], and as such "a blessing on the Romanian soul".&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, p.295&lt;/ref&gt;

The new writings blended cultural activism, social ideals, and contemplation of natural beauty. ''Cartea munților'' thus stands out for promoting [[environmental protection]], with exhortations such as: "Demand, for each and all, the right to rest in the bosom of nature, the right to sunlight, to fresh air, to the green forest, to the thrills of the desire to climb up mountains".&lt;ref name="lmescal27"&gt;Marinescu, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; She was welcoming in influences from the Western [[Spiritualism|Spiritualists]], quoting at length from [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]'s views on the purified and purifying energy of the mountains, concluding: "The discovery of alpine beauty has been a victory of soul over matter."&lt;ref name="crbteoz"/&gt; Mystical, ethical and [[self-help]] subjects formed the bulk of ''Ceasuri sfinte'', which revives and reinterprets symbolic episodes from various religious sources: the [[Book of Jeremiah]], the [[Biblical apocrypha]], the [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[Joan of Arc]]'s call to arms, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, p.296-299&lt;/ref&gt;

Szekulics' literary fragments and chronicles were published in various magazines of the day, including ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', ''[[Ideea Europeană]]'', ''[[Cuget Românesc]]'', [[Henric Sanielevici]]'s ''Curentul Nou'', [[Gala Galaction]]'s ''Cultul Eroilor Noștri'', and [[George Bacaloglu]]'s ''Cele Trei Crișuri''.&lt;ref&gt;Ileana-Stanca Desa, Dulciu Morărescu, Ioana Patriche, Adriana Raliade, Iliana Sulică, ''Publicațiile periodice românești (ziare, gazete, reviste). Vol. III: Catalog alfabetic 1919-1924'', [[Editura Academiei]], Bucharest, 1987, p.171, 192, 211, 213, 469&lt;/ref&gt; Such essays included a 1919 introduction to the [[Synarchism|Synarchist]] ideas of [[Alexandre Saint-Yves d'Alveydre]], explaining them as a superior mix of "nationalism" and "[[humanitarianism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Horia Petra-Petrescu, [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/8027/BCUCLUJ_FP_279996_1924_055_003_004.pdf "Cât de departe am ajuns cu toții..."], in ''Transilvania'', Nr. 3-4/1924, p.82 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumbravă's activism resulted in the creation of modern national tourism associations: in 1921, ''Hanul Drumeților'' (Travelers' Inn), followed in 1925 by the Romanian Touring Club.&lt;ref name="lmescal33"&gt;Marinescu, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; She co-opted other locally famous hikers: physician [[Nestor Urechia]], who is mentioned in her writings as "The Great Bear",&lt;ref&gt;"Cronica", in ''Boabe de Grâu'', March 1931, p.175&lt;/ref&gt; geographer [[Mihai Haret]], and writer [[Emanoil Bucuța]] of ''Boabe de Grâu'' journal, who recognized in her one of the founders of Romanian "Carpathianism". According to Bucuța, Dumbravă presided over a "school" of hiking, which was less daring and more accessible than the mountaineering promoted by her male colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;"Revista Revistelor. ''România. Revista Oficiului Național de Turism''", in ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', Nr. 8/1937, p.479-480&lt;/ref&gt;

At its height, the Touring Club enlisted 4,000 members, grouped into 12 regional subsections, publishing specialized [[topographic map]]s, marking tourist paths, and actively protecting the environment.&lt;ref name="lmescal33"/&gt; The circle was joined by the young poet [[Luca Caragiale]], who was supposed to compose verse for ''Cartea munților'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Emanoil Bucuța]], "Figuri literare. Praznicul unui clasic", in ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', Nr. 11/1938, p.444-445&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Mircea Eliade]], the future novelist and historian of religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Mircea Handoca, [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=1675 "Ecouri livrești în corespondența lui Eliade"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211174520/http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=1675# |date=2012-02-11 }}, in ''[[Apostrof]]'', Nr. 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite old age, Szekulics resumed her active lifestyle. In 1923, she was in Switzerland, where she climbed the [[Matterhorn]], returning in 1925 to escalate one of the [[Mont Blanc]] glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;''Boabe de Grâu'', October 1934, p.635; Marinescu, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Back in Romania, she set up a regional standard for women's rock climbing, after reaching the summit of [[Omu Peak]].&lt;ref name="lmescal33"/&gt; She later settled in [[Bran, Brașov|Bran]] borough, at Poarta village, where she intended to set up her own hostel.&lt;ref name="lmescal28"&gt;Marinescu, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theosophy and final years===
During the latter part of her life, Szekulics became an avid participant in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], a modern spiritual movement centered on the teachings of [[Helena Blavatsky]]. According to Bucuța, this was a natural step from her "credo", the love of travel as physical exercise, to her belief in eternal transition, or [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref name="lmescal27"/&gt; Together with E. F. D. Bertram of [[Ploiești]], the writer founded Romania's first Theosophist Circle, ''Frăția'' ("Brotherhood"). Located at her [[Dorobanți]] townhouse, it was originally a section of the [[Theosophical Society]] chapter in France, but soon emancipated itself as an autonomous Society branch, and set up its own regional network.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/22227/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_491907_5_1924_001_001.pdf "Mișcarea ocultă"], in ''Sfinxul. Revistă pentru Științele Oculte'', Nr. 1/1924, p.16 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

Her circle introduced Romanians to the writings of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], with the 1924 collection ''La picioarele învățătorului'' ("By the Feet of the Teacher"), translated in her own hand.&lt;ref name="lmescal33"/&gt; Like the other prominent Romanian Theosophists, Szekulics affiliated with the [[Freemasonry in Romania|Romanian Masonic]] section, that paid obedience to the National Union of Lodges.&lt;ref name="crbteoz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rcsadov"&gt;{{ro icon}} Radu Cernătescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/sadoveanu_i_eminescu "Sadoveanu și Eminescu"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725220250/http://www.romlit.ro/sadoveanu_i_eminescu# |date=2014-07-25 }}, in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 44/2000&lt;/ref&gt; She held [[Spiritism|Spiritist]] sessions at the [[Marmorosch Blank Bank|Marmorosch Blank Hall]], with Luca's brother, [[Mateiu Caragiale]], and feminist [[Eugenia de Reuss Ianculescu]] as (more or less implicated) witnesses.&lt;ref name="rcsadov"/&gt;

Szekulics, called "perhaps the most involved" Romanian Theosophist by author Constantina Raveca Buleu, eventually presided upon the Theosophical Society's Romanian chapter (est. 1925).&lt;ref name="crbteoz"/&gt; Her contributions as a cultural journalist saw print in several new papers, for instance the Theosophical Society sheet ''Știri și Însemnări'', [[Constantin Angelescu]]'s ''Democrația'', and the Association of Christian Women's ''Foaia Noastră''.&lt;ref&gt;Ileana-Stanca Desa, Dulciu Morărescu, Ioana Patriche, Cornelia Luminița Radu, Adriana Raliade, Iliana Sulică, ''Publicațiile periodice românești (ziare, gazete, reviste). Vol. IV: Catalog alfabetic 1925-1930'', [[Editura Academiei]], Bucharest, 2003, p.312, 397, 937.  {{ISBN|973-27-0980-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also involved as an auditor and reviewer for the feminist Romanian Women Writers' Society, alongside [[Sofia Nădejde]] and [[Laura Vampa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/taranoastra/1925/BCUCLUJ_FP_451581_1925_006_013.pdf "Însemnări"], in ''[[Țara Noastră]]'', Nr. 13/1925, p.416 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of her Theosophical conversion, Szekulics became fascinated with the concepts of [[Indian philosophy]], and dreamed of traveling to the [[British Raj]].&lt;ref name="lmescal34"&gt;Marinescu, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; She got her chance in late 1925, when she was invited to the Theosophical Society Conference, in [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]]. Frozy Nenițescu, who walked her off to [[Gara de Nord]], recalls that Dumbravă was highly emotional traveling "into the land of her dreams."&lt;ref name="bdgoct34-635"/&gt;

Dumbravă took the journey, arriving at [[Mumbai]] port, and then taking the [[Indian Railways]] to [[Chennai|Chennai (Madras)]].&lt;ref name="lbindii2"&gt;{{ro icon}} Liviu Bordaș, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/BORDASfeb5.html "Românii în istoria drumului spre Indii (II)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126174202/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/BORDASfeb5.html# |date=2012-01-26 }}, in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; At Adyar, she met Krishnamurti.&lt;ref name="lmescal34"/&gt; She then took trips through the [[Bengal Presidency]] and the [[Kingdom of Mysore]].&lt;ref name="lbindii2"/&gt;

Having contracted [[malaria]],&lt;ref name="crbteoz"/&gt; Szekulics fell seriously ill on her way home. The ship she was on left her in [[Port Said]], [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], where she was quickly transported to hospital.&lt;ref name="lmescal34"/&gt; Her health worsened and she died there on January 26. According to legend, she had hoped to see the Carpathians, believing that only their sight could cure her.&lt;ref name="crbteoz"/&gt; For reasons unknown, her body was cremated, and her ashes were transported back to Romania inside an Egyptian vase.&lt;ref name="lmescal34"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:V Ocolit 01.jpg|thumb|300px|Bucura Dumbravă Peak, pictured on the right]]
Shortly after her death, Fanny Szekulics was honored with a memorial piece in ''Convorbiri Literare'', signed by [[Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș]], the art historian and courtier.&lt;ref name="lmescal29"/&gt; Similarly, ''[[Țara Noastră]]'' journal assessed: "Her ashen hand [...] will find a good shelter in the soil of our country—a welcoming and loving mother to all those who understand her".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/taranoastra/1926/BCUCLUJ_FP_451581_1926_007_006.pdf "Însemnări"], in ''[[Țara Noastră]]'', Nr. 6/1926, p.198 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; The Bucura Dumbravă Peak, located in the [[Bucegi Mountains|Bucegi]] and identified by some with the sacred ''[[Kogaionon]]'', was named in the writer's honor.&lt;ref name="lmescal28"/&gt;

Her last volume, grouping her letters, came out in 1927 as ''Pe drumurile Indiei. Cele din urmă pagini'' ("On India's Roads. The Very Last Pages").&lt;ref name="crbteoz"/&gt; Moreover, in 1928, ''Der Haiduck'' inspired a [[Cinema of Romania|Romanian film]], with Horia Igirosanu as director.&lt;ref name="crbteoz"/&gt; Part of Szekulics' estate was passed on to Elena Râmniceanu and the Romanian Institute for Social Studies. It was set up as the annual Bucura Dumbravă Award for Ethics, and had as its first recipient Emanoil Bucuța.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emanoil Bucuța]], "Institutul Social Român", in ''Boabe de Grâu'', August–September 1931, p.382-383&lt;/ref&gt; A "friends of Bucura Dumbravă" circle still reunited periodically in commemoration of her death, and, in 1934, published a tribute volume, ''Când trec anii'' ("As Years Pass").&lt;ref&gt;''Boabe de Grâu'', October 1934, p.632&lt;/ref&gt;

Her books went through several reprints, before, during, and after [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;Marinescu, p.30, 35-36&lt;/ref&gt; and inspired illustrations by woman artist [[Olga Greceanu]].&lt;ref&gt;"Boerul Amza-Jianu", in ''[[Universul Literar]]'', Nr. 5/1944, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, ''Der Haiduck'' was used by C. N. Mihăilescu and Ion Șahighian as the basis for another feature film, ''Iancu Jianul''.&lt;ref name="crbteoz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lmescal30"/&gt;

Despite being relatively famous in her lifetime, Bucura Dumbravă was generally ignored by later schools of literary criticism. As noted by Luiza Marinescu, "she was not included in neither Romanian literary histories nor German ones" (with the exception of ''[[Enciclopedia Cugetarea]]'', 1940), and was disregarded for her presence on Queen Elisabeth's "[[camarilla]]".&lt;ref&gt;Marinescu, p.27, 28, 31&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1935, essayist [[Petru Comarnescu]] opined that Bucura Dumbravă's work had a "local" character, and was far less important than that of her [[Modernist literature|modernist]] peers—[[Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu]], [[Henriette Yvonne Stahl]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Petru Comarnescu]], "Evoluția scrisului feminin în România", in ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', Nr. 12/1935, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; Still, [[Perpessicius]] writes, ''Cartea munților'' survives as the "''[[vade mecum]]'' of hiking".&lt;ref name="crbteoz"/&gt;

Authors were more interested in her adventurous life and her Theosophical ideas. Completed shortly after her death, the novel ''[[Craii de Curtea-Veche]]'' by [[Mateiu Caragiale]] makes a sarcastic reference to her as "the theosophist Papura Jilava", briefly seen dancing with the antagonist.&lt;ref name="stc351"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crbteoz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rcsadov"/&gt; As a mystic who died mysteriously, Szekulics is notably mentioned in [[Mircea Eliade]]'s 1940 novella, ''[[Secretul doctorului Honigberger]]''.&lt;ref name="crbteoz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Eliade]], [http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_the-secret-of-dr-honigberger.html ''The Secret of Dr. Honigberger'']{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]] ''[http://www.plural-magazine.com/ Plural Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321152817/http://www.plural-magazine.com/ |date=March 21, 2012 }}'', Nr. 4/1999; [[Antoine Faivre]], "Modern Western Esoteric Currents in the Work of Mircea Eliade. The Extent and Limits of Their Presence", in [[Christian K. Wedemeyer]], [[Wendy Doniger]] (eds.), ''Hermeneutics, Politics, and the History of Religions: The Contested Legacies of Joachim Wach and Mircea Eliade'', [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford etc., 2010, p.149.  {{ISBN|978-0-19-539433-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the establishment of a [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], Dumbravă's work, with its monarchist connections, was removed from the literary canon. In the [[Romanian diaspora]], however, two more editions of her work were published (1954, 1956).&lt;ref name="lmescal36"&gt;Marinescu, p.36&lt;/ref&gt; At home, such reconsideration came in 1969, when historian [[Dumitru Almaș]] and [[Editura Tineretului]] republished Brătianu's 1912 translation; literary critic Mircea Handoca also put up a 1970 reprint of ''Cartea munților'', at Editura Stadion.&lt;ref name="lmescal36"/&gt; A ballet adaptation of ''Haiducul'' was also produced by the [[Romanian National Opera, Bucharest|Romanian National Opera]],&lt;ref name="siabraš683"/&gt; followed in 1982 by another ''Iancu Jianu'' film, with [[Dinu Cocea]] as director and [[Adrian Pintea]] as the star actor.&lt;ref name="crbteoz"/&gt;

Still, biographical entries on her were scarcely found in specialty works until the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], when she came to be mentioned in standardized writers' dictionaries.&lt;ref name="lmescal31"/&gt; In 2011, cartoonist [[Vali Ivan]] relied on her ''Der Haiduck'' to draw a [[graphic novel]] about the times of Iancu Jianu.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Manolescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/nichita_stnescu_n_benzi_desenate "Nichita Stănescu în benzi desenate"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924125907/http://www.romlit.ro/nichita_stnescu_n_benzi_desenate# |date=2015-09-24 }}, in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 44/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Canted [[facade]]s are a typical of, but not exclusive to, [[Baroque architecture]]. The [[angle]] breaking the facade is less than a [[right angle]] thus enabling a canted facade to be viewed as, and remain, one composition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24902">[[File:RBG color wheel.svg|right]]A '''color term''' (or color name) is a [[word]] or [[phrase]] that refers to a specific [[color]]. The color term may refer to human perception of that color (which is affected by visual context) which is usually defined according to the [[Munsell color system]], or to an underlying physical property (such as a specific wavelength of [[visible light]]). There are also numerical systems of color specification, referred to as [[color space]]s.

An important distinction must be established between color and shape, these two attributes usually are used in conjunction with one another when describing in language. For example, being labeled as alternative parts of speech terms color term and shape term.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Color Categories in Thought and Language; "The neuropsychology of color" |last=Davidoff |first=Jules |publisher=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge |year=1997 |isbn=9780521498005 |location=Cambridge, England |pages=118–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological conditions for recognition of colors exist, such as those who cannot discern colors in general ([[Aphantasia]]) or those who see colors as sound ([[Synesthesia]])

==In natural languages==
[[wikt:monolexemic|Monolexemic]] color words are composed of individual [[lexeme]]s, or root words, such as "red", "brown", or "[[olive (color)|olive]]". Compound color words make use of adjectives (e.g. "light brown", "sea green") or compounded basic color words (e.g. "yellow-green").

=== Color dimensions ===
There are many different dimensions by which color varies. For example, [[hue]] (shades of [[red]], [[Orange (colour)|orange]], [[yellow]], [[green]], [[blue]], and [[Purple (color)|purple]]), [[saturation (color theory)|saturation]] ("deep" vs. "[[Pale (color)|pale]]"), and [[brightness]] or intensity make up the [[HSI color space]]. The adjective "[[fluorescent]]" in English refers to moderately high brightness with strong color saturation.  [[Pastel]] refers to colors with high brightness and low saturation.

Some phenomena are due to related optical effects, but may or may not be described separately from the color name. These include [[Gloss (material appearance)|gloss]] (high-gloss shades are sometimes described as "metallic"; this is also a distinguishing feature of gold and silver), [[iridescence]] or [[goniochromism]] (angle-dependent color), [[dichroism]] (two-color surfaces), and [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] (solid vs. translucent).

=== Cultural differences ===
Different cultures have different terms for colors, and may also assign some color terms to slightly different parts of the human color space: for instance, the [[Chinese character]] [[wikt:青|青]] (pronounced {{lang|cmn-Latn|qīng}} in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] and {{lang|ja-Latn|[[Ao (color)|ao]]}} in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]) has a meaning that covers both [[distinction of blue and green in various languages|blue and green]]; blue and green are traditionally considered shades of "[[wikt:青|青]]". In more contemporary terms, they are [[wikt:藍|藍]] ({{lang|cmn-Latn|lán}}, in Mandarin) and [[wikt:綠|綠]] ({{lang|cmn-Latn|lǜ}}, in Mandarin) respectively. Japanese also has two terms that refer specifically to the color green, {{lang|ja|[[wikt:緑|緑]]}} ({{lang|ja-Latn|midori}}, derived from the classical Japanese descriptive verb {{lang|ja-Latn|midoru}} "to be in leaf, to flourish" in reference to trees) and {{lang|ja|グリーン}} ({{lang|ja-Latn|guriin}}, which is derived from the English word "green").{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} However, in Japan, although the traffic lights have the same colors that other countries have, the green light is described using the same word as for blue, {{lang|ja-Latn|aoi}}, because green is considered a shade of {{lang|ja-Latn|aoi}}; similarly, green variants of certain fruits and vegetables such as green apples, green ''[[perilla|shiso]]'' (as opposed to red apples and red shiso) will be described with the word {{lang|ja-Latn|aoi}}.

Similarly, languages are selective when deciding which hues are split into different colors on the basis of how light or dark they are. English splits some hues into several distinct colors according to lightness: such as [[red]] and [[pink]] or [[orange (colour)|orange]] and [[brown]]. To English speakers, these pairs of colors, which are objectively no more different from one another than light green and dark green, are conceived of as belonging to different categories.&lt;ref name="BerlinKay1969"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Brent  |last1=Berlin |author1-link=Brent Berlin |first2=Paul |last2=Kay |author2-link=Paul Kay |year=1969 |title=[[Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Russian will make the same red / pink and orange / brown distinctions, but will also make a further distinction between {{lang|ru-Latn|sinii}} and {{lang|ru-Latn|goluboi}}, which English speakers would simply call dark and light blue. To Russian speakers, {{lang|ru-Latn|sinii}} and {{lang|ru-Latn|goluboi}} are as separate as red and pink, or orange and brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070430/full/news070430-2.html |title=Seeing the blues |website=Nature News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several researchers have studied the [[Himba people|Ova-Himba]] perception of colors.&lt;ref name="himba colour"&gt;{{cite web |last=Roberson |first=Debi |last2=Davidoff |first2=Jules |last3=Davies |first3=Ian R.L. |last4=Shapiro |first4=Laura R. |title=Colour Categories and Category Acquisition in Himba and English |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/43627151_Colour_categories_and_category_acquisition_in_Himba_and_English |format=pdf |department=The Department of Psychology |publisher=[[University of Essex]] |access-date=2012-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ova-Himba use four color names: ''zuzu'' stands for dark shades of blue, red, green, and purple; ''vapa'' is white and some shades of yellow; ''buru'' is some shades of green and blue; and ''dambu'' is some other shades of green, red, and brown. It is thought that this may [[Stroop effect|increase the time it takes]] for the [[Himba people|Ova-Himba]] to distinguish between two colors that fall under the same Herero color category, compared to people whose language separates the colors into two different color categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reiger |first=Terry |first2=Paul |last2=Kay |title=Language, thought, and color: Whorf was half right |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Cognitive Sciences]] |date=28 August 2009 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.07.001 |url=http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/tics2.pdf |format=pdf |access-date=2012-08-29 |volume=13 |pages=439–446 |pmid=19716754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] [[Hungarian language#Two words for "red"|have multiple words]] for "red": {{lang|hu|piros}} and {{lang|hu|vörös}} (Hungarian; {{lang|hu|vörös}} is a darker red), and {{lang|tr|kırmızı}}, {{lang|tr|al}}, and {{lang|tr|kızıl}} (Turkish); kırmızı now includes all reds but originally referred to [[crimson]], to which it is cognate, while kızıl mainly refers to [[scarlet (color)|scarlet]] and other orange-tinted or brownish reds. Two words for "red" are also found in [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]] ({{lang|ga|dearg}} for light, bright red and {{lang|ga|rua}} or {{lang|ga|ruadh}} respectively for dark, brownish red). [[Turkish language|Turkish]] also has two words for "white" ({{lang|tr|beyaz}} and {{lang|tr|ak}}) and "black" ({{lang|tr|siyah}} and {{lang|tr|kara}}). Ak and beyaz have the same meaning, while kara is a broader term than siyah and also includes dark browns; which word is used also depends on the kind of object being described. Similarly, Irish uses two words for [[green]]: {{lang|ga|glas}} denotes the green color of [[plants]], while {{lang|ga|uaine}} describes artificial greens of dyes, paints etc. This distinction is made even if two shades are identical.

In the [[Komi language]], [[green]] is considered a shade of [[yellow]] ({{lang|kv|виж}}, {{lang|kv|vizh}}), called {{lang|kv|турун виж}} ({{lang|kv|turun vizh)}}: "grass yellow".&lt;ref&gt;Rueter, Jack M.

In the [[Pirahã language]], there may be no color words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kay|first1=Paul|title=PIRAHÃ COLOR TERMS|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/myl/languagelog/archives/004399.html|publisher=upenn|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Basic color terms ===
However, Brent Berlin and Paul Kay, in their classic study of worldwide color naming ''[[Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution]]'' (1969),&lt;ref name="BerlinKay1969"/&gt; argued that these differences can be organized into a coherent hierarchy, and that there are a limited number of universal "basic color terms" which begin to be used by individual cultures in a relatively fixed order. Berlin and Kay based their analysis on a comparison of color words in 20 languages from around the world. To be considered a basic color term, the words had to be
* monolexemic ("green", but not "light green" or "forest green"),
* high-frequency, and
* agreed upon by speakers of that language.

Berlin and Kay's study further identified a culture state of color term recognition into stages (I-VII). Stage I only covers two terms white and black however  these terms are referenced broadly to describe other undefined color terms. For example, the Jale highland group in New Guinea identify the color of blood as black. This is because at this stage I, white and black, are associated with which objects closer associates to the degree of brightness from which it has.{{what|date=June 2018}}

With stage II the recognition of another term red is developed. Objects are less consternated to their degree of brightness for classification and instead in this stage we see each term cover a larger scope of colors. Specifically blue and other darker shades described as black, yellow/orange colors lumped together with red, and the colors similar to white as white.

At stage III the identification of another term is acquired, however the newly acquired term differs but usually with either green (III a) or yellow (III b). At this stage there are more cultures who recognize yellow rather than green first. Currently there are two languages which identify green first, the  Ibiobio Nigerian language and the Philippine language of Mindoro, Hanunoo.

At stage IV regardless of which term was acquired by a culture the term not defined is now acquired at this stage bringing the total terms to five.

In short, their analysis showed that in a culture with only two terms, they would roughly correlate with "dark" (covering [[black]], dark colors, and cold colors such as blue) and "bright" (covering [[white]], light colors, and warm colors such as red). All languages with three colors terms would add [[red]] to this distinction. Thus, the three most basic colors are black, white, and red. Additional color terms are added in a fixed order as a language evolves: first one of [[green]] or [[yellow]]; then the other of green or yellow; then [[blue]]. All languages distinguishing six colors contain terms for black, white, red, green, yellow, and blue. These colors roughly correspond to the sensitivities of the retinal ganglion cells, leading Berlin and Kay to argue that color naming is not merely a cultural phenomenon, but is one that is also constrained by biology—that is, language is shaped by perception. A 2012 study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Loreto | first1 = Vittorio | last2 = Mukherjee | first2 = Animesh | last3 = Tria | first3 = Francesca | year = 2012 | title = On the origin of the hierarchy of color names | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109 | issue = 18| pages = 6819–6824 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1113347109| pmc = 3344991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the origin of this hierarchy may be tied to human vision and the time ordering in which these color names get accepted or agreed upon in a population perfectly matches the order predicted by the hierarchy.

As languages develop, they next adopt a term for [[brown]]; then terms for [[orange (colour)|orange]], [[pink]], [[purple]] or [[gray]], in any order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Varley |editor-first=Helen |title=Color |location=London |date=1980 |publisher=Marshall Editions |isbn=0-89535-037-8 |chapter=The Vocabulary of Color |pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a basic light/dark relativistic term appears: such as [[Azure (color)|"light" blue]] / [[Navy Blue|"dark" blue]] (in comparison to blue sky / blue ocean), or [[Pink|"pale" red]] / [[Maroon|"deep" red]].

The proposed evolutionary trajectories as of 1999 are as follows. Eighty percent of sampled languages lie along the central path.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kay and Luisa Maffi, 'Color Appearance and the Emergence and Evolution of Basic Color Lexicons', ''American Anthropologist,'' 1999 March 7.[http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/color.app.evol.ps]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today every natural language that has words for colors is considered to have from two to twelve basic color terms. All other colors are considered by most speakers of that language to be variants of these basic color terms. [[English language|English]] contains eleven basic color terms: "black", "white", "red", "green", "yellow", "blue", "brown", "orange", "pink", "purple", and "grey". [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] have twelve, distinguishing [[blue]] and [[Azure (color)|azure]]. That doesn't mean English speakers cannot describe the difference of the two colors, of course; however, in English, ''azure'' is not a basic color term because one can say ''bright sky blue'' instead, while ''pink'' is basic because speakers do not say ''light red''.

{{further|Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate}}

=== Abstract and descriptive color words ===

Color words in a language can also be divided into abstract color words and descriptive color words, though the distinction is blurry in many cases. Abstract color words are words that only refer to a color. In English white, black, red, yellow, green, blue, brown, and gray are abstract color words. These words also happen to be 'basic color terms' in English as described above, but colors like [[maroon (color)|maroon]] and [[magenta]] are also abstract though they may not be considered 'basic color terms', either because they are considered by native speakers to be too rare, too specific, or subordinate hues of more basic colors (red in the case of maroon, or purple/pink in the case of magenta).

Descriptive color words are words that are secondarily used to describe a color but primarily used to refer to an object or phenomenon. "[[Salmon (color)|Salmon]]", "[[rose (color)|rose]]", "[[saffron (color)|saffron]]", and "[[lilac (color)|lilac]]" are descriptive color words in English because their use as color words is derived in reference to natural colors of [[salmon]] flesh, [[rose]] flowers, infusions of [[saffron]] pistils, and [[lilacs|lilac]] blossoms respectively. Often a descriptive color word will be used to specify a particular hue of basic color term (salmon and rose [descriptive] are both hues of pink).

Colors in some languages may be denoted by descriptive color words even though other languages may use an abstract color word for the same color; for example in Japanese pink is {{lang|ja-Latn|momoiro}} ({{lang|ja|桃色}}, lit. "peach-color") and gray is either {{lang|ja-Latn|haiiro}} or {{lang|ja-Latn|nezumiiro}} ({{lang|ja|灰色}}, {{lang|ja|鼠色}}, lit. "ash-color" for light grays and "mouse-color" for dark grays respectively); nevertheless, as languages change they may adopt or invent new abstract color terms, as Japanese has adopted {{lang|ja-Latn|pinku}} ({{lang|ja|ピンク}}) for pink and {{lang|ja-Latn|guree}} ({{lang|ja|グレー}}) for gray from English. "Vaaleanpunainen", the [[Finnish Language|Finnish]] word for "pink" is a clear [[Agglutinative language|agglutination]] of the language's words for "white" ("valkoinen") and "red" ("punainen").

The status of some color words as abstract or descriptive is debatable. The color "[[pink]]" was originally a descriptive color word derived from the name of a flower called a "pink" (see [[dianthus]]); however, because the word "pink" (flower) has become very rare whereas "pink" (color) has become very common, many native speakers of English use "pink" as an abstract color word alone and furthermore consider it to be one of the basic color terms of English. The name "[[purple]]" is another example of this shift, as it was originally a word that referred to a [[dye]] (see [[Tyrian purple]]).

The word "[[orange (word)|orange]]" is difficult to categorize as abstract or descriptive because both its uses, as a color word and as a word for an object, are very common and it is difficult to distinguish which of the two is primary. As a basic color term it became established in the early to mid 20th century; before that time artist's palettes called it "yellow-red". In English, the use of the word "orange" for a fruit predates its use as a color term. The word comes from [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|orenge}}, which derives via [[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa-Latn|narang}} from a [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]] such as [[Tamil language|Tamil]] or [[Tulu language|Tulu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |date=June 2012 |title=orange, n.1 and adj.1 |encyclopedia=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/132163 |accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The derived form ''orangish'' as a color is attested from the late 19th century&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]],'' 'orangish'&lt;/ref&gt; by reference to the fruit. Nevertheless, "orange" (color) is usually given equal status to red, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, pink, gray, white and black (all abstract colors) in membership among the basic color terms of English. Based solely on current usage of the word, it would be impossible to distinguish whether the fruit is called an orange because of its color, or the color is so called after the fruit. (This problem is also illustrated by ''[[violet (color)|violet]]'' and ''[[indigo]]''.)

In Italian there is an adjective ''arancione'' different of and derived from the fruit name ''arancio''. In Portuguese, it is usual to distinguish the fruit ''laranja'' from the color name ''cor-de-laranja'', which means 'color-of-orange'. The same goes for ''Rosa'' ('rose') and ''cor-de-rosa'' ('color-of-rose'); and ''Violeta'' ('violet') and ''cor-de-violeta'' ('color-of-violet').

==Struggle in linguistics==
Research on color terms is often conducted without reference to common uses of the term or its significance within the context of its original language. In John A. Lucy's article ''The linguistics of "color"'' he identifies two key categories. One of these is "characteristic referential range", or the use of a color term to identify or differentiate a referent over a wide context.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Research across different languages and how they define a color term becomes increasingly difficult as differentiating and relying on traditional methods rather than cultural and intuition become problematic.

==Standardized systems==

Some examples of color naming systems are CNS&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The disadvantage of these systems, however, is that they only specify specific color samples, so while it is possible to, by interpolating, convert any color to or from one of these systems, a lookup table is required.  In other words, no simple invertible equation can convert between CIE XYZ and one of these systems.

[[Philately|Philatelists]] traditionally use names to identify [[postage stamp color]]s. While the names are largely standardized within each country, there is no broader agreement, and so for instance the US-published [[Scott catalog]] will use different names than the British [[Stanley Gibbons]] catalogue.

On modern computer systems a standard set of basic color terms is now used across the [[Web colors|web color names]] (SVG 1.0/CSS3), [[HTML color names]], [[X11 color names]] and the [[.NET Framework]] color names, with only a few minor differences.

The [[Crayola]] company is famous for its many [[List of Crayola crayon colors|crayon colors]], often creatively named.

[[Heraldry]] has standardized names for "[[Tincture (heraldry)|tincture]]s", subdivided into "colors", "metals", and "furs".

==Emotional impact of color naming==
Even the base word of a color has strong metaphorical resonances. For example, a linguistic study of Berlin and Kay study showed that the color red was almost always named at stage II due to the crucial importance of blood.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Modifiers expand and nuance the connotations of a color, as best seen in fashion and paint terminology, which seeks to imbue colors with  emotional associations. Thus the same "[[Poppy (flower)|poppy]] yellow" paint can become the hot-blooded "[[amber]] rage", the peaceful "late afternoon sunshine", or the wealth-evoking "sierra gold". The divisions of [[General Motors]] often give different names to the same colors featured on different car models.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}  The attachment of an emotional context to a color may make it easier for a customer to decide among choices.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Neon and fluorescent==
Names given to the most vivid colors often include the word ''neon'', alluding to the bright glow of [[neon lighting]].  Dyes and inks producing these colors are often [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]], producing a luminous glow when viewed under a [[black light]], and such pigments appear significantly brighter in mid-day overcast conditions due to a greater proportion of ultraviolet light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/sunshine-on-a-cloudy-day Sunshine on a Cloudy Day] American Scientist Magazine website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==

# The past, also called preterite, is rarely used in the spoken and written language and the same applies for the past anterior in both indicative and [[subjunctive mood]]s (because it has the past form of ''haver'' in the composite form). In the modern language, the periphrastic past and the periphrastic past anterior replace the past and the past anterior. The main auxiliary verb is ''anar'', but one must pay attention that it is slightly conjugated in a different way than the actual ''anar'' (a non-auxiliary verb expressing the meaning 'to go'). e.g. ''(Jo) vaig anar'' = I went.
# The participle must [[Agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with the noun in [[grammatical gender]] (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural).
# ''Haver'' is never used in the imperative and all of the composite tenses.
# The [[personal pronoun]]s are omitted in the spoken and written language, except only where to clear up the ambiguity and that is usually when the conjugated verbs look similar (ex.: the conjugated first and third person singulars in the imperfect). The pronouns may also be used to empathize the verbs. In this list, the pronouns only serve as a guide for each grammatical person.

'''Cut and run''' or '''cut-and-run''' is an [[idiom]]atic [[verb phrase]] meaning to "make off promptly" or to "hurry off". The phrase originated in the 1700s as describing an act allowing a ship to make sail quickly in an urgent situation, either by cutting free an anchor or by cutting ropeyarns to unfurl sails from the [[Yard (sailing)|yards]] on a [[square rig]] ship. Though initially referring to a literal act, the phrase was used figuratively by the mid-1800s in both the United States and England. The phrase is used as a [[pejorative]] in political language, implying a panicked and cowardly retreat, and it has been used by politicians in the United States, Great Britain, and Australia as a criticism of calls to withdraw troops, becoming particularly associated with the [[United States Republican Party]].

== Origin ==
To "cut and run" was defined by Englishman David Steel in 1794 as "to cut the cable and make sail instantly, without waiting to weigh anchor".{{sfn|Steel|2011|p=136}} He further described the practice as "quick but very expensive" but sometimes necessary, such as when the anchor is hooked on rocks and cannot be retrieved, in bad weather, when the anchor is on [[lee shore]] and the ship is in danger of [[embayment]], or when one must quickly escape or pursue an enemy; instead of cutting the anchor by axe at the [[hawsehole]], Steel offered an alternate method of slipping the anchor cable if time permitted, a method he felt wiser than cutting as it potentially prevented loss of anchor and cable.{{sfn|Steel|2011|p=70-71}} An alternate origin comes from the practice on [[square rig]] ships to furl the sails stopped to the [[Yard (sailing)|yards]] with ropeyarns so that the yarns may be cut to let the sails fall unfurled should an urgent need to sail arise.{{sfn|Kemp|1994|p=221}} The phrase was in use by the early 1700s, and ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cited the earliest printed usage of the phrase to ''[[The Boston News-Letter]]'' in 1704.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/view/Entry/46341#eid7593967|title=cut, v. |year=1989 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Though "cut and run" initially referred to a literal act, the phrase later appeared in figurative usage in ''[[White-Jacket]]'' (1850) by American author [[Herman Melville]] and in ''[[Great Expectations]]'' (1861) by English author [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Safire"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/02/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-5-2-04-on-language-cut-and-run.html|title=The Way We Live Now: 5-2-04: On Language; Cut and Run|last=Safire|first=William|authorlink=William Safire|date=May 2, 2004|website=|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oxford English Dictionary'' defines the figurative, colloquial usage as "to make off promptly" or to "hurry off".&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;

=== In politics ===
In May 2004, [[William Safire]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that the phrase, when used in reference to politics and war, lost its "lighthearted sense" and came to become a [[pejorative]] implying panic and "cowardice, going beyond an honorable surrender" and is "said in derogation of a policy to be opposed with the utmost repugnance".&lt;ref name="Safire" /&gt; [[Dana Milbank]] characterized the phrase as a [[slogan]] used by members of [[Republican Party (United States)|United States Republican Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/20/AR2006062001343.html|title=It's Time to Cut and Run From 'Cut and Run'|last=Milbank|first=Dana|authorlink=Dana Milbank|date=June 21, 2006|website=|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|access-date=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/128686-cut-and-run/|title=Cut and Run|last=Pesca|first=Mike|authorlink=Mike Pesca|last2=Milbank|first2=Dana|authorlink2=Dana Milbank|date=June 23, 2006|website=On the Media|publisher=[[WNYC]]|access-date=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in December 2015, [[Robert Entman]] identified the phrase as one of numerous [[meme]]s or slogans that "trigger a series of instant, clear mental associations" lending to the "communicative success" of the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Entman|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Entman|date=December 3, 2015|title=Framing and party competition: How Democrats enabled the GOP’s move to the uncompromising right|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2015/12/03-framing-party-competition-entman/party_competition.pdf|journal=Issues in Governance Studies|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]|issue=70|doi=|pmid=|access-date=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[George Lakoff]] stated that the phrase is an example of the Republican Party's skill at "distilling an issue to a simple phrase" and analyzed the phrase as one that "presupposes that the opposite is to stand and fight".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/06/21/gop_wants_cut_and_run_label_to_stick/|title=GOP wants 'cut and run' label to stick|last=Williams|first=Joseph|date=June 21, 2006|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|access-date=June 11, 2016|via=[[Boston.com]]}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the phrase saw usage by politicians as a criticism against calls to withdraw from the [[Lebanese Civil War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/target/interviews/weinberger.html|title=Interview: Caspar Weinberger|last=|first=|date=September 2001|website=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]|publisher=[[PBS]]|access-date=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Every choice a bad choice|last=Kilpatrick|first=James|date=October 27, 1983|work=[[The Daily Register]]|quote=The alternative, in the short and ugly phrase, is to cut and run — to withdraw from the multinational peacekeeping force and to bring the Marines home.

The multinational force would be disbanded; diplomatic efforts at internal reconciliation would be set back; factional bloodshed would return.

Variations on the phrase were used by [[Ken Mehlman]], then Chairperson of the United States [[Republican National Committee]], to describe the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party's]] call to withdraw troops from the Iraq War: "Some are saying we need to cut and run, others are saying we need to cut and jog, and still others are saying we need to cut and walk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|date= June 20, 2006|title= The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer|medium= Television production|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0606/20/sitroom.01.html|access-date= June 11, 2016|publisher= [[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4306">'''East New Guinea Highlands''' is a 1960 proposal by [[Stephen Wurm]] for a [[language family|family]] of [[Papuan languages]] spoken in [[Papua New Guinea]] that formed part of his 1975 expansion of [[Trans–New Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/%5C/15/show_family.asp?subid=91568 East New Guinea Highlands]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in the 15th edition of ''Ethnologue'' (and a few languages which escaped [http://www.ethnologue.com/%5C/15/show_family.asp?subid=91717]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt; The original proposal consisted of West-Central (Engan), Central (Chimbu–Wahgi), East-Central (Goroka), and Eastern (Kainantu). Duna and Kalam were added in 1971. East New Guinea Highlands was broken up by [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]] in his 2005 classification (see below), but all branches were retained, and all remain within the now expanded Trans–New Guinea.  This language grouping should not be confused with the [[East Papuan languages]], a separate hypothesis.

Ross classified each of the families in bold as a separate branch of TNG, with the exceptions of Kainantu and Goroka, which he kept together; Kalam, which he linked to the [[Rai Coast languages|Rai Coast family]]; and Kenati, which he had insufficient data to classify but which has since been associated with Kainantu.

Ross believes that these languages lie near the homeland of proto–Trans New Guinea.

The '''Ekoid languages''' are a [[dialect cluster]] of [[Southern Bantoid languages]] spoken principally in southeastern [[Nigeria]] and in adjacent regions of [[Cameroon]]. They have long been associated with the [[Bantu languages]], without their status being precisely defined. Crabb (1969)&lt;ref&gt;Crabb, D.W. 1969. Ekoid Bantu Languages of Ogoja. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; remains the major monograph on these languages, although regrettably, Part II, which was to contain grammatical analyses, was never published. Crabb also reviews the literature on Ekoid up to the date of publication.

The nearby [[Mbe language]] is the closest relative of Ekoid&lt;ref&gt;{{glotto|ekoi1237|Ekoid–Mbe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forms with it the Ekoid–Mbe branch of Southern Bantoid.

==Languages==
''Ethnologue'' lists the following Ekoid varieties with the status of independent languages. Branching is from Watters (1978) and Yoder et al. (2009).

*[[Ndoe language|Ndoe]]
*(core)
**[[Ejagham language|Ejagham]] (Ekoi)
**Efutop–Ekajuk: [[Efutop language|Efutop]], [[Nde-Nsele-Nta language|Nde-Nsele-Nta]], [[Abanyom language|Abanyom]], [[Nkem-Nkum language|Nkem-Nkum]], [[Ekajuk language|Ekajuk]]–[[Nnam language|Nnam]]

==Phonology==
Proto-Ekoid is reconstructed with the following vowels and tones: {{IPA|*/i e ɛ a ɔ o u/}}; high, low, rising, falling, and [[downstep]]. The rising and falling tones, though, might be composite.

It is thought to have the following consonants:

{| class="wikitable" style=text-align:center
!
! [[Labial consonant|Labial]]
! [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]
! [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]] /&lt;br /&gt;[[Postalveolar consonant|Postalveolar]]
! [[Velar consonant|Velar]]
! [[Labial–velar consonant|Labiovelar]]
|-
! [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]
| {{IPA|m}} || {{IPA|n}} || colspan=2|{{IPA|ɲ ~ ŋ}} || {{IPA|ŋm}}
|-
! [[Stop consonant|Stop]] /&lt;br/&gt;[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]
| {{IPA|p b}}|| {{IPA|t d}} ||{{IPA|tʃ dʒ}}|| {{IPA|k ɡ}} || {{IPA|kp ɡb}}
|-
! [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]
| {{IPA|f v}} || {{IPA|s z}} || {{IPA|ʃ}} || ||
|-
! [[Rhotic consonant|Rhotic]]
| || {{IPA|r}} || ||
|-
! [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]
| {{IPA|β}} || {{IPA|l}}|| {{IPA|j}} || {{IPA|ɣ}} || {{IPA|w}}
|}

{{IPA|[ɲ]}} occurs at the beginning of a word, and {{IPA|[ŋ]}} in the middle or at the end.

==Study==
The first publication of Ekoid material is in Clarke (1848)&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, John 1848. Specimens of dialects: short vocabularies of languages: and notes of countries and customs in Africa. Berwick-upon-Tweed: Daniel Cameron&lt;/ref&gt; where five ‘dialects’ are listed and a short wordlist of each is given. Other major early publications are Koelle (1854),&lt;ref&gt;Koelle, S.W. 1854. Polyglotta Africana. London: Church Missionary Society&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas (1914)&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, N.W. 1914. Specimens of languages from Southern Nigeria. London: Harrison &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; and Johnston (1919–1922).&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, H.H. 1919-22. A comparative study of the Bantu and Semi-Bantu languages. (2 vols.) Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt; Although Koelle lumped his specimens in the same area, it seems that Cust (1883)&lt;ref&gt;Cust, R.N. 1883. The modern languages of Africa. 2 vols. London: Richard Bentley&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to link them together and place them in a group co-ordinate  with Bantu but not within it. Thomas (1927)&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, N.W. 1927. The Bantu languages of Nigeria. In: Festschrift Meinhof F. Boas et al. eds. 65-73. Hamburg: Friederichsen &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; is the first author to make a correct classification of Ekoid Bantu, but oddly the much later Westermann &amp; Bryan (1952)&lt;ref&gt;Westermann, Diedrich &amp; Bryan, M.A. (1970 [1952]). The Languages of West Africa. Oxford: International African Institute / Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; repeats an older, inaccurate classification. This also propagated another old error and included the [[Nyang languages]] with Ekoid. Nyang languages have their own quite distinct characteristics and are probably further from Bantu than Ekoid.

Guthrie (1967–1971)&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, Malcolm 1967-71. Comparative Bantu. 4 vols. Farnham: Gregg International Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; could not accept that Ekoid formed part of Bantu. His first improbable explanation was that its ‘Bantuisms’ resulted from speakers of a Bantu language being ‘absorbed’ by those who spoke a ‘Western Sudanic’ language, in other words, the apparent parallels, were simply a massive block of loanwords. This was later modified into ‘Ekoid languages may to some extent share an origin with some of the A zone languages, but they seem to have undergone considerable perturbations’ (Guthrie 1971, II:15). Williamson (1971)&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, K. 1971. The Benue–Congo languages and Ịjọ. Current Trends in Linguistics, 7. ed. T. Sebeok. 245-306. The Hague: Mouton&lt;/ref&gt; in an influential classification of Benue–Congo assigned Ekoid to ‘Wide Bantu’ or what would now be called Bantoid, a rather untidy mass of languages lying somehow between Bantu and the remainder of [[Benue–Congo languages|Benue–Congo]].

All modern classifications of Ekoid are based on Crabb (1969) and when Watters (1981)&lt;ref&gt;Watters, John R. 1981. A phonology and morphology of Ejagham, with notes on dialect variation. Ph.D. thesis. University of California at Los Angeles. xviii, 549 p.&lt;/ref&gt; came to explore the proto-phonology of Ekoid, he used this source, rather than his own field material from the Ejagham dialects in Cameroon. A problematic aspect of Crabb is his notation of Ekoid which does not clearly distinguish phonetic from phonemic transcription. Fresh work on Ejagham by Watters (1980,&lt;ref&gt;Watters, John R. 1980. The Ejagam noun class system: Ekoid Bantu revisited. In Larry M. Hyman (ed.), Noun classes in the Grassfields Bantu borderland, 99-137. Southern California Occasional Papers in Linguistics, 8. Los Angeles: University of Southern California&lt;/ref&gt; 1981) has extended our knowledge of the Cameroonian dialects of Ekoid. However, an important unpublished dissertation by Asinya (1987)&lt;ref&gt;Asinya, O.E. 1987. A reconstruction of the Segmental phonology of Bakor (an Ekoid Bantu language). M.A. Linguistics, University of Port Harcourt&lt;/ref&gt; based in fresh fieldwork in Nigeria made an important claim about Ekoid phonology, namely that most Ekoid languages have long/short distinctions in the vowels. Ekoid has raised particular interest among Bantuists because it has a noun-class system that seems close to Bantu and yet it cannot be said to correspond exactly (Watters 1980).

{{one source|date=October 2018}}
An '''elicitation technique''' is any of a number of [[data collection]] techniques used in [[anthropology]], [[cognitive science]], counseling, [[education]], [[knowledge engineering]], [[linguistics]], [[management]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], or other fields to gather knowledge or information from people. Elicitation, in which knowledge is sought directly from human beings, is usually distinguished from indirect methods such as gathering information from written sources.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooke |first=Nancy J. |title=Varieties of knowledge elicitation techniques |journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies |volume=41 |year=1994 |pages=801–849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who interacts with [[Human subject research|human subjects]] in order to elicit information from them may be called an ''elicitor'', an ''analyst'', ''experimenter'', or ''knowledge engineer'', depending on the field of study.&lt;ref name="Cooke" /&gt;

Elicitation techniques include [[interview]]s, observation of either naturally occurring  behavior (including as part of [[participant observation]]) or behavior in a laboratory setting, or the analysis of assigned tasks.&lt;ref name="Cooke" /&gt;

'''Hagfa Pinyim''' or '''HagFa PinYim''' ({{lang|zh|客家話拼音}}, literally "Hakka Pinyin") is a system of [[Romanization of Chinese|romanization]] used to transcribe Chinese characters as used in [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] into [[Latin script]]. Hagfa Pinyim was developed by [[Lau Chun-fat]] ({{lang|zh|劉鎮發}}) for use in his ''Hakka Pinyin Dictionary'' ({{lang|zh|客語拼音字彙}}, literally "Hakka Pinyin Vocabulary") that was published in 1997. The romanization system is named after the [[Pinyin]] system used for [[Mandarin Chinese]] and is designed to resemble Pinyin.

==Writing system==
Hagfa Pinyim uses the [[Latin alphabet]] and numbers to indicate tones.&lt;ref name="pinyim-phonetic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dylansung.tripod.com/hakga/hakrom.htm|title=Hakka Phoneticisation|publisher=Dylan W.H. Sung|accessdate=27 Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single hyphen is added to indicate a compound. Vowels indicated are regular forms but sometimes irregular forms occur.

'''Harákmbut''' or '''Harákmbet''' is a small language family in Peru spoken by the [[Harakmbut people]].

Campbell &amp; Grondona (2012) note that Adelaar "presents reasonably persuasive evidence that Harákmbut and [[Katukinan]] are genetically related."

The '''Hurro-Urartian languages''' are an [[extinct language|extinct]] [[language family]] of the [[Ancient Near East]], comprising only two  known languages: [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] and [[Urartian language|Urartian]], both of which were spoken in the [[Taurus mountains]] area.

==Classification==

Hurro-Urartian was related neither to the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] (a branch of [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]], such as [[Aramaic]], [[Amorite]] or [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]) nor to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] languages (such as [[Hittite language|Hittite]], [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) of the region.

[[Igor Diakonoff]] and others have suggested ties between the Hurro-Urartian languages and the [[Northeastern Caucasian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Diakonoff, I. M. ''The Pre-History of the Armenian People'' tr. Lori Jennings with revisions by author. Delmar, New York 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies argue that the connection is quite certain.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov, Vyacheslav V. "Comparative Notes on Hurro-Urartian, Northern Caucasian and Indo-European." ''UCLA Indo-European Studies'' '''1''' (1999): 147-264 http://www.pies.ucla.edu/IESV/1/VVI_Horse.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sergei A. Starostin:  Igor M. Diakonoff, ''Hurro-Urartian as an Eastern Caucasian Language'' Munich: R. Kitzinger, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greppin, John AC. "The Urartian Substratum in Armenian" ''Bulletin of the Georgian National Academy of Sciences'' '''2''':2:134-137 (2008),  http://science.org.ge/old/2-2/Grepin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The poorly attested [[Kassite language]] may have been related to Hurrian.&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Thomas|title=Kassitisch und Hurro-Urartäisch. Ein Diskussionsbeitrag zu möglichen lexikalischen Isoglossen|journal=Altorientalische Forschungen|year=2003|issue=30|pages=372–381|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==

[[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] was the language of the [[Hurrians]] (occasionally called "Hurrites"), and was spoken in the northern parts of [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Syria]] and the southeastern parts of [[Anatolia]] between at least last quarter of the third millennium BC and its extinction towards the end of the second millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, Gernot. 2008. Hurrian. In Woodard, Roger D. (ed.) The Ancient Languages of Asia Minor. p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; There have been various Hurrian-speaking states, of which the most prominent one was the kingdom of [[Mitanni]] ([[1450 BC|1450]]&amp;ndash;[[1270 BC]]). It has also been proposed that two little known groups, the [[Nairi]] and the [[Mannae]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mannea|title=MANNEA|work=iranicaonline.org|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; might have been Hurrian speakers, but as little is known about them, it is hard to draw any conclusions about what languages they spoke. Furthermore, the [[Kassite language]] was possibly related to Hurro-Urartian.&lt;ref name=Schneider /&gt; Francfort and Tremblay&lt;ref&gt;Francfort H.-P., Tremblay X. [https://scribd.com/document/242322412/Francfort-et-Tremblay-Marhasi-et-la-civilisation-de-l-Oxus-pdf Marhaši et la civilisation de l'Oxus] // Iranica Antiqua, vol. XLV (2010), pp. 51–224. doi: 10.2143/IA.45.0.2047119.&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of the Akkadian textual and archaeological evidence, proposed to identify the kingdom of [[Marhashi]] and [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Ancient Margiana]]. The Marhashite personal names seems to point towards an Eastern variant of Hurrian or another language of the Hurro-Urartian language family.

There was also a strong Hurrian influence on Hittite culture in ancient times, so many Hurrian texts are preserved from Hittite political centres. The Mitanni variety is chiefly known from the so-called "[[Amarna letters|Mitanni letter]]" from Hurrian [[Tushratta]] to pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]] surviving in the [[Amarna]] archives. The "Old Hurrian" variety is known from some early royal inscriptions and from religious and literary texts, especially from Hittite centres.

[[Urartian language|Urartian]] is attested from the late 9th century BC to the late 7th century BC as the official written language of the state of [[Urartu]] and was probably spoken by the majority of the population in the mountainous areas around [[Lake Van]] and the upper [[Great Zab|Zab]] valley. It branched off from Hurrian at approximately the beginning of the second millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, Gernot. 2008. Urartian. In Woodard, Roger D. (ed.) The Ancient Languages of Asia Minor. p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Igor Diakonoff]] accepts a Hurro-Urartian etymology as plausible for thirteen lexemes in [[Old Armenian]].&lt;ref&gt;John A. C. Greppin; I. M. Diakonoff, Some Effects of the Hurro-Urartian People and Their Languages upon the Earliest Armenians, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 111, No. 4 (Oct., 1991), pp. 720-730&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

Besides their fairly consistent ergative [[morphosyntactic alignment|alignment]] and their generally agglutinative morphology (despite a number of not entirely predictable morpheme mergers), Hurrian and Urartian are also both characterized by the use of suffixes in their derivational and inflectional morphology (including ten to fifteen [[grammatical case]]s) and [[postposition]]s in syntax; both are considered to have the default order [[subject–object–verb]], although there is significant variation, especially in Urartian. In both languages, nouns can receive a peculiar "[[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] suffix" comparable (albeit apparently not identical) to a [[definite article]], and nominal modifiers are marked by [[Suffixaufnahme]] (i.e. they receive a "copy" of the case suffixes of the head); in verbs, the type of [[verb valency|valency]] (intransitive vs transitive) is signalled by a special suffix, the so-called "class marker". The complex morpheme "chains" of nouns and verbs follow roughly the same morpheme sequences in both languages. In nouns, the sequence in both languages is stem – article – possessive suffix – plural suffix – case suffix – agreement (Suffixaufnahme) suffix. In verbs, the portion of the structure shared by both languages is stem – valency marker – person suffixes. Most morphemes have fairly similar phonological forms in the two languages.

Despite this structural similarity, there are also significant differences. In the phonology, written Hurrian only seems to distinguish a single series of phonemic obstruents without any contrastive phonation distinctions (the variation in voicing, though visible in the script, was allophonic); in contrast, written Urartian distinguishes as many as three series: voiced, voiceless and "emphatic" (perhaps glottalized). Urartian is also characterized by the apparent reduction of some word-final vowels to schwa (e.g. Urartian ''ulə'' vs Hurrian ''oli'' "another", Urartian ''eurišə'' vs Hurrian ''evrišše'' "lordship", Hurrian 3rd person plural enclitic pronoun ''-lla'' vs Urartian ''-lə''). As the last two examples shows, the Hurrian geminates are also absent in Urartian.

In the morphology, there are differences as well. Hurrian indicates the plural of nouns through a special suffix ''-až-'', which only survives in fossilized form merged into some case endings in Urartian. Hurrian clearly marks tense or aspect through special suffixes (the unmarked form is the present tense) whereas Urartian has not been shown to do so in the attested texts (the unmarked form functions as a past tense). Hurrian has special negative verbal suffixes that negate a verb and are placed before the ergative person agreement suffixes; Urartian has no such thing and instead uses negative particles that are placed before the verb. In Hurrian, only the person of the ''ergative subject'' is marked obligatorily through a suffix in a verb form, whereas the ''[[absolutive case|absolutive]]'' subject or object is optionally marked with a pronominal enclitic that need not be attached to the verb and can also be attached to any other word in the clause. In Urartian, the ergative suffixes and the absolutive clitics have merged into a single set of obligatory suffixes that express the person of both the ergative and the absolutive participant and are an integral part of the verb. In general, the profusion of freely moving pronominal and conjunctional clitics that characterize Hurrian, especially that of the Mitanni letter, has few parallels in Urartian.

Urartian is closer to the so-called Old Hurrian variety (mostly attested in Hittite documents) than to the Hurrian of the Mitanni letter. For example, both use ''-o-/-u-'' (rather than ''-i-'') as the marker of transitive valency and both display the plural suffix ''-it-'', expressing the number of the ergative subject and occupying a position before the valency marker.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, Gernot. 2008. Hurrian. In Woodard, Roger D. (ed.) The Ancient Languages of Asia Minor. pp. 81-104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, Gernot. 2008. Urartian. In Woodard, Roger D. (ed.)

'''Jugatram Chimanlal Dave''' (1892–1985)&lt;ref name="books.google_a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Das|first=Sisir Kumar|title=A History of Indian Literature: 1800–1910, western impact: indian Response, Volume 8|year=1991|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|location=New Delhi|page=658|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sHklK65TKQ0C&amp;pg=PA658&amp;dq=jugatram+dave#v=onepage&amp;q=jugatram%20&amp;f=false|isbn=8172010060}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Gandhian]] social activist, freedom fighter and author from [[Gujarat]], [[India]] who is remembered for his social work among the tribals of [[South Gujarat|southern Gujarat]].

== Early life and education ==
Dave was born in [[Kathiawar]] and schooled in [[Bombay]] and went to [[Baroda]] in 1915 where he worked as a school teacher under [[N. C. Kelkar|Kakasaheb Kelkar]] for some years. In 1917 he joined Gandhi at the [[Kochrab Ashram]] and later went with him to the [[Sabarmati Ashram]] where he came to be regarded as an ideal ashram inmate. He taught at a school in the Ashram and later worked at the [[Navjivan|Navjivan Press]].&lt;ref name="jamnalalbajajfoundation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shri Jugutram Dave|url=http://www.jamnalalbajajfoundation.org/media/pdf/JBA_1978_Bio_Jugatram_Dave.pdf|publisher=Jamnalal Bajaj Foundation|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gandhian activist ==
Responding to Gandhi's call for constructive work after the [[Non Cooperation Movement]], Dave chose to work on rural development in [[Bardoli]] in the [[Surat district]] where he joined the Swaraj Ashram in 1924. In Bardoli, Dave's efforts focused on the landless [[bonded labour]]ers called ''halpatis'' and the Raniparaj Adivasis both groups that were exploited by moneylenders, landlords and contractors. Dave focused on spreading education among these groups through the establishment of ''[[balwadi]]s'' and ''ashramshalas'' and popularised the [[spinning wheel]] among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Desai|first=J C|title="A LONGER WAY IS STILL AHEAD," Says Jugatram Dave|journal=Yojana|date= January 1967|volume=11|series=1|page=37|url=http://yojana.gov.in/cms/(S(yif1ksmeugkn5f55ilqqhy2o))/pdf/Yojana/English/1967-68/Jan_Vol11_No1.pdf|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at the Bardoli ashram, he participated in the flood relief efforts in Gujarat in 1927. A Raniparaj Vidyalaya for the education of adivasis was established at Bardoli in 1926 which subsequently shifted to Vedchhi and it was here that Dave worked for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Desai|first=I P|title=THE VEDCHHI MOVEMENT (A Sociological Essay)|url=http://www.css.ac.in/download/english/The%20Vedchhi%20Movement.pdf|publisher=Centre for Regional Development Studies, Surat|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in the freedom struggle ==
Dave, along with [[Swami Anand]], assisted [[Sardar Vallabhai Patel]] in the [[Bardoli Satyagraha]] on the wishes of Gandhi. Dave was tasked with covering the Sardar's speeches in Bardoli which he reported to Anand in [[Surat]] who in turn brought them to the larger public through newsletters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Patil|first=Jayant|title=Agricultural and Rural Reconstruction: A Sustainable Approach|year=1996|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|location=New Delhi|page=147|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JW3N-JtJuaYC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=jugatram+dave#v=onepage&amp;q=jugatram%20dave&amp;f=false|isbn=8170225892}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served several terms in prison for his participation in the [[Salt Satyagraha]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gandhi|first=Rajmohan|title=Mohandas: True Story of a Man, His People|year=2007|publisher=Penguin|location=UK|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-FDI8LkGsIAC&amp;pg=PT435&amp;lpg=PT435&amp;dq=jugatram+dave#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9788184753172}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Individual Satyagraha]] and the [[Quit India Movement]]. He was also associated with the [[Charkha Sangh]], the [[Talimi Sangh]] and the All India Village Industries Association.&lt;ref name="jamnalalbajajfoundation" /&gt;

== Life in independent India ==
Dave worked with [[Vinobha Bhave]] and [[Jaiprakash Narayan]] in the establishment of the [[Shanti Sena]], an unarmed volunteer force that was formed in the aftermath of the [[Indo-China War of 1962]], that undertook rural reconstruction work in the [[North East Frontier Agency]] (NEFA) which had been an important theatre of the war. The Sena later undertook humanitarian work among the refugees from [[East Pakistan]] in the run up to the [[liberation of Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Patil|first=Jayant|title=Agricultural and Rural Reconstruction: A Sustainable Approach|year=1996|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|location=New Delhi|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JW3N-JtJuaYC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=jugatram+dave+shanti+sena#v=onepage&amp;q=jugatram%20dave%20shanti%20sena&amp;f=false|isbn=8170225892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Thomas|title=Gandhi's Peace Army: The Shanti Sena and Unarmed Peacekeeping|year=1996|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse|pages=87,127|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BJ2B1TY6dL8C&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=jugatram+dave#v=onepage&amp;q=jugatram%20dave&amp;f=false|isbn=0815626843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dave was also deeply interested in issues of education. In 1967, the Vedchhi Ashram founded the [[Gandhi Vidyapith]] and the Shanti Sena Vidyalaya. He argued that in [[independent India]] basic educational curriculum must not only be productive and schooling rooted in society but also that it should emphasise on national ideas and character formation.&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rao|first=V V|title=Education in India|year=2004|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|location=New Delhi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aTAB-CAUrVoC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=jugatram+dave+kothari+commission#v=onepage&amp;q=jugatram%20dave%20kothari%20commission&amp;f=false|isbn=8171418589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

The diminutive KP Saxena was as ordinary as any elder living in old Lucknow.

His eyes and brows asked as well as answered questions as the mouth was often engaged in chewing the succulent 'paan ki gilauri'. A conversation with him could begin only when the taste buds were done with soaking the flavours wrapped in the 'beeda'. The sentences often began with 'amaa miyan aap bhi kamaal hain'. The phrase was followed by a qissa (anecdote) that unfolded with several rounds of bone tickling and ended with a social message that compelled introspection.

Consider the satirical piece 'Bank Locker' which begins with 'aapki kasam sahibon, ek hamare pas bhi hai ... bank locker' – a style so Lakhnavi. "Laakar (as locker is written in Hindi) samajhte hain na..." KP asks in his distinct style. "Jis mein laa, laa kar rakha jaye..." he reveals even as the mind races to find a suitable answer. As the 'qissagoyi' (narration) proceeds, KP's pennilessness comes to the fore.

And as always, Mirza is witness to his plight in the typical sentence, "mere dost Mirza mere dard se waqif the.." The high point comes when he launches a humorous attack on corrupt officials stating, "afsaron ke laakar khole gaye to karoro rupyon ka desh prem baramad hua.." It ends with the message that the empty locker of honesty should not be spoiled with offerings of bribery.

"His art of story telling was an embodiment of Lucknow's Ganga-Jamuni tehzib," says Sarvesh Asthana, city- based satirist. "He generously used terms like 'amaa miyan' (hey you), barkhurdar (son), baat ka chalan (due course of conversation), fasad ki jad (root of trouble) , tabiyat hui ki (I felt like) any Lucknowite would relate with to weave his stories that wittily attacked cultural decay and social insensitivity," adds Asthana.

Having written more than 17,000 pieces in 50 years, KP introduced and established Lakhnavi lingo and way of life to the world of Hindi literature. A time came when his talent and style became the fourth pillar of Indian satire and humour as he joined the league of stalwarts like Harishankar Parsai, Sharad Joshi and Srilal Shukla. "His demise has closed the chapter of Lakhnavi style humour and satire," said Asthana.

A distinct KP satire always revolved around Mirza, Panditji or Bibi, the characters through whom he targeted the 'evil' around him. The piece was incomplete without the mention of paan ki gilauri and murgha (chicken). On many occasions, the 'paan ki gilauri' (laao zara ek gilauri to khilao, phir socha jaye) was medicinal for the thought process while murgha was the instrument to damn mindless actions ('murghe ki tarah baang de rahe ho', or 'murghe ki tarah ek taang pe kyo khade ho').

"The beauty of KP's style lies in its simplicity but the attack on the 'wrong' haunting his mind was always the punch," says Ashok Chakradhar, poet and satirist. For instance, he damned India's consistent poor show during the Olympics by stating, "Olympic woh ghaat hai jahan hamare khiladi apna sar mundwate hain aur naak katwate hain magar doob ke mar nahin paate kyunki unke andar haad maas ki jagah shayad hawa bhari hui hai."

To acknowledge his immense contribution to Hindi literature, K.P.Saxena Vyangyakar Samman is awarded every year on his birth anniversary. For 2017, [[Suryakumar Pandey]] was awarded the K.P.Saxena Varishth Vyangyakar Samman.&lt;ref&gt;http://khabarindia24.in/sury-kumar-pandey-to-get-kp-saxena-award/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://epaper.navbharattimes.com/details/11563-76207-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://epaper.livehindustan.com/story.aspx?id=1840373&amp;boxid=106754254&amp;ed_date=2017-4-2&amp;ed_code=55&amp;ed_page=5&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014 [[Burundi]] has three [[official language]]s: [[Kirundi language|Kirundi]], [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ru/books?id=2OA9DQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;ots=tFzjIGhvwU&amp;dq=langues%20officielles%20au%20burundi%20kirundi%20fran%C3%A7ais%20anglais&amp;hl=ru&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Les approches bi-plurilingues d'enseignement-apprentissage: autour du programme Écoles et langues nationales en Afrique (ELAN-Afrique): Actes du colloque du 26-27 mars 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;. By the same law on languages promulgated in 2014&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senat.bi/en/?page_id=669 L’an 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Kiswahili is mentioned as a fourth language spoken and taught in the country. Of these, only Kirundi is spoken by the vast majority of the population. It is recognised as the [[national language]] by the [[Constitution of Burundi|Burundian constitution of 2005]].&lt;ref name=IWACU&gt;{{cite web|last1=Uwimana|first1=Diane|title=English is now official language of Burundi|url=http://www.iwacu-burundi.org/blogs/english/english-is-now-official-language-of-burundi/|publisher=Iwacu English News|accessdate=11 November 2015|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; French is spoken by a significant minority and is spoken mainly as a [[second language]] or by foreign residents of the country.

Burundi is unusual among African states in having a single indigenous language shared by its entire population. In one estimate, 98 percent of Burundians speak Kirundi.&lt;ref name=ulaval&gt;{{cite web|title=Burundi|url=http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/afrique/burundi.htm|publisher=Université de Laval|work=L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde|accessdate=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Ruanda-Urundi|Belgian colonial rule]] (1919–62), Kirundi was taught whereas under [[German East Africa|German rule]] (1894–1916) Swahili had been encouraged.&lt;ref name=ulaval/&gt; In recent years, the Burundian government has promoted the use of Kirundi language as way to unify the country's different ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=ulaval/&gt;

The country is considered part of ''[[Francophonie]]''. As a legacy of [[Ruanda-Urundi|Belgian colonial rule]], French has an important role in government, business, and the educated classes but only between 3 and 10 percent of the population speak the language fluently.&lt;ref name=ulaval/&gt; Burundian vernacular French also frequently incorporates [[loanword]]s from Kirundi, [[Lingala]] and other languages.&lt;ref name=ulaval/&gt;

Spoken languages in Burundi include Swahili which is widely spoken in the [[African Great Lakes|African Great Lakes region]].&lt;ref name=ulaval/&gt; It is especially used in commerce and in connection with the country's [[Islam in Burundi|Muslim minority]] or with immigration from elsewhere in East Africa.&lt;ref name=ulaval/&gt;

The [[language]]s of [[South America]] can be divided into three broad groups: 
* the languages of the (in most cases, former) [[colonialism|colonial powers]]
* many [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]], some of which are co-official alongside the colonial languages
* and various pockets of other languages spoken by immigrant populations that have survived assimilation by the majority languages

The languages introduced by the process of the [[European colonization of the Americas]] are chiefly [[Indo-European languages|European]], some of whom have given rise to the formation of [[creole languages|creole]]s.

[[Spanish language|Spanish]], with slightly fewer speakers than Portuguese, is the second most spoken language on the continent.

Other official and majority languages in specific countries are:
* [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in [[Suriname]]
* [[English language|English]] in [[Guyana]] and the [[Falkland Islands]] (Spanish: Islas Malvinas). 
* [[French language|French]] in [[French Guiana]], an [[overseas department]] of France.

==Indigenous languages ==
[[File:SouthAmerican families.png|right|250px|thumb|Main language families of South America (other than Quechuan, Aimaran and Mapudungun, which expanded after the Spanish Conquest).]]
[[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Indigenous languages]] of South America include, among several others, the [[Quechua languages]] in [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]] and to a lesser extent in [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Colombia]]; [[Guarani language|Guaraní]] in [[Paraguay]] and to a much lesser extent in Argentina and Bolivia; [[Aymara language|Aymara]] in Bolivia, Peru and to a lesser extent in Chile; [[Wayuu language|Wayuu]] in northern Colombia and northwest [[Venezuela]]; and [[Mapudungun]] in small pockets of southern Chile and Argentina.

In Bolivia, Quechua, Aymara, and Tupi Guarani are co-official alongside Spanish. In Paraguay, Guarani shares joint official status with Spanish. In Colombia, the languages of the country's ethnic groups are constitutionally recognized as official languages in their territories; more than 60 such aboriginal languages exist today. In Ecuador, Spanish, [[Northern Quechua]] and [[Shuar]] are official for intercultural relations. In Peru, Quechua, Aymara, and other indigenous languages are co-official in the areas where they are predominant. There are many other languages once spoken in South America that are extinct today (such as the [[extinct languages of the Marañón River basin]]).

In Brazil, there are around 135 indigenous languages confirmed. The regions with the most speakers are northern and southern Brazil, where there is a larger concentration of native people. Indigenous populations have been trying to keep their traditions of their homeland, with the help of [[Fundação Nacional do Índio|Funai]], the agency responsible for the protection of the native people.

'''Malachy of Ireland''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1279–1300), also known as '''Malachias Hibernicus''', was a theologian and [[Archbishop of Tuam]] in 1280.

He was a [[friar]] of the [[Franciscan]] [[convent]] of [[Limerick]] and was elected [[Archbishop of Tuam]], though never officially installed. He was first mentioned in a letter of 1279 from [[Nicol Mac Máel Ísu]], [[Archbishop of Armagh]], to [[Edward I of England]], [[Lord of Ireland]], asking that Brother Malachy be appointed to Tuam. The king granted this request in a letter dated 22 April 1280. However, five of the seven canons of Tuam chosen as electors voted for [[Nicol Mac Flainn]], a fellow canon. This resulted in [[Stephen de Fulbourn]] being transferred from Waterford to Tuam. Malachy had by then abandoned his claim, and his election was annulled.

Malachy may also be the author of a [[treatise]], ''De veneno'', on the [[seven deadly sins]], published in [[Paris]] in 1518 and alternatively attributed to [[Robert Grosseteste]]. It is stated as having been written ''"for the instruction of simple men who have to teach the people"''. The edition stated that he was a Franciscan preacher who was alive in 1300, ''"a doctor of theology, a strenuous expounder of the scriptures and a most zealous rebuker of vices."'' Apparently he also wrote a book of sermons, now lost. [[John Bale]] recorded that he was well received in Ireland, esteemed at [[Oxford]], and preached before [[Edward II]].

A '''maritime pilot''', also known as a '''marine pilot''', '''harbor pilot''' or '''bar pilot''' and sometimes simply called a '''pilot''', is a [[sailor]] who maneuvers [[ship]]s through dangerous or congested waters, such as [[harbor]]s or [[river mouth]]s. They are highly experienced shiphandlers possessing detailed knowledge of the particular waterway, e.g. actual depth, direction and strength of the wind, current and tide at any time of the day. The pilot is a navigational expert for the port of call. 

Maneuvering a ship through the shallow water to berth / unberth in a port requires teamwork which involves, apart from the port pilot, the ship's captain (jointly responsible), ship's crew, port tugs, and shore linesmen. Since the pilot is on board the ship, they control the tugs and linesmen through a radio, and the ship directly. The ship's captain ensures their crew carry out the pilot's orders.

High skill is required to be a pilot as the channels through which the ships move towards the port are  normally too narrow and shallow for the size of the ships, with the stopping distance of the ships being only a few nautical miles and the fact that ships do not steer at slow speed. Even if a ship captain is a regular visitor to a certain port, they can not match the expertise and experience of the Pilot.

In an unfortunate case of an accident, high pollution is a risk as a ship may carry thousands of tonnes of fuel for her own consumption.(Clean up cost and other damages of the [[Exxon Valdez]] disaster was around $5 billion).
Also if a ship is wrecked in the channel, the channel and the port could be closed for months until the shipwreck is removed.

Most ports have compulsory pilotage.

Legally, the master has full responsibility for safe navigation of their vessel, even if a pilot is on board. If they have clear grounds that the pilot may jeopardize the safety of navigation, they can relieve the pilot from their duties and ask for another pilot or, if not compulsory to have a pilot on board, navigate the vessel without one. Only in transit of the [[Panama Canal]] and in Canada does the pilot have the full responsibility for the navigation of the vessel.  

In [[English law]], Section 742 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 defines a pilot as "any person not belonging to a ship who has the conduct thereof." In other words, someone other than a member of the crew who has control over the speed, direction, and movement of the ship. The current [[United Kingdom]] legislation governing pilotage is the [[Pilotage Act 1987]].

Pilotage is one of the oldest professions, as old as sea travel, and it is one of the most important in maritime safety. The oldest ''recorded'' history dates back to about the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/money/2007/may/29marine.htm "Be a marine pilot"] Retrieved 3 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The economic and environmental risk from today's large [[cargo ship]]s makes the role of the pilot essential{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

== History ==

The work functions of the pilot go back to [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, when locally experienced [[harbour]] captains, mainly local [[fishermen]], were employed by incoming ships' captains to bring their trading vessels into port safely. Eventually, because the act of pilotage needed to be regulated and to ensure that pilots had adequate insurance, the harbours licensed pilots.  The [[California Board of Pilot Commissioners]] was the first government agency created by California's legislature, in 1850.

Before harbour boards were established, pilots known as '''hobblers''' would compete with one another.  The first to reach an incoming ship would navigate it to the docks and receive payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hobblers – who were they?|url=http://lugnad.ie/hobblers/|publisher=On-line Journal of Research on Irish Maritime History|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Dún Laoghaire]], Ireland, there is a monument to the hobblers who lost their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Quilter |first=V |title=Sailing History |url=http://www.dlharbour.ie/content/history/articles/hobblers.php |work=Hobbling Disaster |publisher=DúnLaoghaire Harbour Company |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129190413/http://www.dlharbour.ie/content/history/articles/hobblers.php |archivedate=January 29, 2013 }}  &lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kent]] they were known as "hovellers" and worked alongside and in competition with the licensed pilots, but were sometimes blamed as [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|wrecker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bathurst|first=Bella|title=The Wreckers|accessdate=Jun 26, 2015|date=2005|publisher=HarperCollins|pages=42-50}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Byng Gattie defends the hovellers or "hobilers" as lifesavers in his 1890 book about the [[Goodwin Sands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gattie|first=George Byng|title=Memorials of the Goodwin Sands, and their surroundings, legendary and historical|url=https://archive.org/stream/memorialsofgoodw00gatt#page/92/mode/2up|accessdate=Jun 26, 2015|year=1890|publisher=J J Keliher &amp; Co|location=London|pages=92-107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although licensed by the harbour to operate within their jurisdiction, pilots were generally self-employed, and so had to have quick transport to get from the port to the incoming ships. As pilots were often still dual-employed, they used their own [[fishing boat]]s to reach the incoming vessels. But fishing boats were heavy working boats, and filled with fishing equipment, hence a new type of boat was required.

Early boats were developed from single-masted [[Cutter (boat)|cutters]] and twin-masted [[yawl]]s, and later into the specialist [[pilot cutter]]. These were effectively light-weight and over-powered single masted boats with large steeply angled keels, making them deep [[Draft (hull)|draft]] under power and shallow draft in lighter sail. [[Joseph Henderson (pilot)|Joseph Henderson]] was an early American harbor pilot. He is well known for being a [[Sandy Hook]] Pilot for the New York harbor and along the Atlantic Coast during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. 

Some historic pilot vessels are still sailing:
* Eighteen [[Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter]]s are believed to survive worldwide. In addition to them...
* The German pilot schooner ''[[No. 5 Elbe]]'' was launched in 1883 and had a long history as pilot boat, as private yacht named ''Wander Bird'' and later as home to hippies in San Francisco, before returning to Germany and being restored as a traditional sailing boat.
* The German pilot schooner ''Cuxhaven'' was launched in 1901 and survived as a sailing boat, renamed ''[[Atalanta (ship)|Atalanta]]'' and still active as a traditional sail training ship under that name.
* The US motorboat [[USS California (SP-647)|USS ''California'']] was completed in 1910 and served in [[World War I]] on harbor patrol duty.
* The US two-masted gaff-rigged schooner [[Adventuress (schooner)|''Adventuress'']] launched in 1913 also saw service as a [[pilot boat]], and during [[World War II]] served with the [[United States Coast Guard]].
* The US two-masted [[gaff rig|gaff-rigged]] [[schooner]] [[Zodiac (schooner)|''Zodiac'']] was built as a racing sailboat in 1924 and also named ''California'' after being acquired by the [[San Francisco Bar Pilots Association]] for use as a pilot boat.
* The US schooner ''[[Roseway]]'', built in 1925, owned by the Boston Pilot Association for thirty years until 1973, now a registered [[U.S. National Historic Landmark]] operating in Boston and St. Croix, USVI by World Ocean School, Camden, ME.
The ''Zodiac'' and ''Adventuress'' are both listed with the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and are now cruising in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington state]] after restorations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schoonerzodiac.com/history.htm |title=Schooner '&amp;#39;Zodiac'&amp;#39; History |publisher=Schoonerzodiac.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adven"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/maritime/nhl/adven.htm|title=Schooner Adventuress National Historic Landmark Study|date=1989-04-11|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their size and mass makes large ships very difficult to manoeuvre; the stopping distance of a [[supertanker]] is typically measured in miles/kilometers and even a slight error in judgment can cause [[million]]s of [[dollar]]s in damage. For this reason, many years of experience in an operating area are required to qualify as a pilot.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  For example, the [[California Board of Pilot Commissioners]] requires that pilot trainees must have a master's license, two years command experience on tugs or deep draft vessels, and pass a written exam and simulator exercise, followed by a period of up to three years training gaining experience with all types of vessel and docking facilities.  Following licensing, pilots are required to engage in extensive continuing educational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

By far the most challenging part of any ship's voyage is the passage through the narrow waterways that lead to [[port]] and the final [[Dock (maritime)|dock]]ing of the ship. The pilot brings to the ship expertise in handling large vessels in confined waterways and expert local knowledge of the port. In addition to bringing local maritime expertise on board, unlike the vessel's captain the pilot is insulated from the economic pressures (e.g., getting the ship from point A to point B on time, regardless of weather conditions, traffic, or other navigation issues) that can compromise safety. Instead of being part of the ship's crew, pilots are employed locally and therefore act on behalf of the public rather than of the shipowners.{{fact|date=January 2011}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Normally, the pilot joins an incoming ship prior to the ship's entry into the shallow water at the designated "Pilot boarding area" via helicopter or [[pilot boat]] and climbs a [[pilot ladder]] sometimes up to 40 feet (~12 metres) to the [[Deck (ship)|deck]] of the largest [[Container ship|container]] and [[tank ship|tanker]] ships. Climbing the pilot ladder can be dangerous, even more so in rough seas considering that both the ship to be piloted and the pilot's own vessel are usually both moving. With outgoing vessels, a pilot boat returns the pilot to land after the ship has successfully negotiated coastal waters.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.impahq.org/admin/resources/pilottransferarrangementsbrochure.pdf Pilot Transfer Arrangements]" ''International Maritime Pilots’ Association'' 2012. Accessed: 7 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilots specifically use [[pilotage]] techniques relying on nearby visual reference points and local knowledge of [[tide]]s, swells, [[Ocean current|currents]], depths and [[shoal]]s that might not be readily identifiable on [[nautical chart]]s without first hand experience in the waters in question.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Beyond the experience and training of regular ships' captains, pilots also receive special, ongoing training to stay on top of their profession. Pilots are required by law in most major sea ports of the world for large ships.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.
In every case, during the time passed aboard for operation, the pilot will remain under the Master's authority, and always out of "ship's command chain". The pilot remains aboard as an important and indispensable -Consultant of the Master-.

However, in some countries, Masters (and sometimes other ranks too) of ships that call at only a few ports and so have strong local knowledge and experience of navigating in those ports, such as a [[ferry]], may be issued with a '''pilotage exemption certificate''', which relieves them of the need to take a pilot on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/21/part/I/crossheading/compulsory-pilotage |publisher = [[legislation.gov.uk]] |title=Pilotage Act 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Masterpiece''', '''''magnum opus''''' ([[Latin]], ''great work'') or '''''chef-d’œuvre''''' ([[French language|French]], ''master of work'', plural ''chefs-d’œuvre'') in modern use is a creation that has been given much critical praise, especially one that is considered the greatest work of a person's career or to a work of outstanding creativity, skill, profundity, or workmanship. Historically, a "masterpiece" was a work of a very high standard produced to obtain membership of a guild or academy in various areas of the visual arts and crafts.
[[File:Zuccari Two painter's apprentices.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Federico Zuccari]], ''Two Painter's Apprentices'', 1609. They would have to produce a ''masterpiece'' to become masters at the end of their apprenticeships.]]

==Etymology==
The form ''masterstik'' is recorded in English or [[Scots language|Scots]] in a set of [[Aberdeen]] guild regulations dated to 1579, whereas "masterpiece" is first found in 1605, already outside a guild context, in a [[Ben Jonson]] play.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]:"Masterpiece". See also: [http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861628683/masterpiece.html Encarta]. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kx5TnWWs?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861628683/masterpiece.html Archived] 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Masterprize" was another early variant in English.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]:"Masterprize"&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, the term rapidly became used in a variety of contexts for an exceptionally good piece of creative work, and was "in early use, often applied to man as the 'masterpiece' of God or Nature".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], and examples&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally, the term ''masterpiece'' referred to a piece of work produced by an [[apprentice]] or [[journeyman]] aspiring to become a [[master craftsman]] in the old European [[guild]] system. His fitness to qualify for guild membership was judged partly by the masterpiece, and if he was successful, the piece was retained by the guild. Great care was therefore taken to produce a fine piece in whatever the craft was, whether confectionery, [[painting]], [[goldsmith]]ing, [[Knife making|knifemaking]], or many other trades.

In [[Kingdom of England|England]], in the 17th century, the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]], for instance, required an apprentice to produce a masterpiece under their supervision at a "workhouse" in [[Goldsmiths' Hall]]. The workhouse had been set up as part of a tightening of standards after the company became concerned that the level of skill of goldsmithing was being diluted. The wardens of the company had complained in 1607 that the "true practise of the Art &amp; Mystery of Goldsmithry is not only grown into great decays but also dispersed into many parts, so as now very few workmen are able to finish &amp; perfect a piece of plate singularly with all the garnishings &amp; parts thereof without the help of many &amp; several hands...". The same goldsmithing organization still requires the production of a masterpiece but it is no longer produced under supervision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegoldsmiths.co.uk/library/archives/a-history-of-the-goldsmiths%27-company/ ''A History of the Goldsmiths' Company.''] The Goldsmiths' Company. Retrieved 30 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldsmiths-centre.org/professional-training/goldsmiths-company-apprenticeship-programme/ Goldsmiths' Company Apprenticeship Programme.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20141230121155/http://www.goldsmiths-centre.org/professional-training/goldsmiths-company-apprenticeship-programme/ |date=2014-12-30 }} The Goldsmiths' Centre. Retrieved 30 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nuremberg, Germany, between 1531 and 1572, apprentices who wished to become master goldsmith were required to produce [[columbine cup]]s, dice for a steel seal, and gold rings set with precious stones before they could be admitted to the goldsmiths' guild. If they failed to be admitted, then they could continue to work for other goldsmiths but not as a master themselves. In some guilds, apprentices were not allowed to marry until they had obtained full membership.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O91876/cup-jamnitzer-wenzel/ Cup, Silver, room 69, case 25.] Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. Retrieved 30 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of producing a masterpiece has continued in some modern academies of art, where the general term for such works is now [[reception piece]]. The [[Royal Academy]] in London uses the term "[[diploma work]]" and it has acquired a fine collection of diploma works received as a condition of membership.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="916">In [[telecommunication]], a '''medium-power talker''' is a hypothetical talker, within a [[log-normal distribution]] of talkers, whose volume lies at the [[Average|medium]] [[Power (physics)|power]] of all talkers determining the volume distribution at the point of interest.  

When the distribution follows a log-normal curve (values expressed in decibels), the mean and standard deviation can be used to compute the medium-power talker. The talker volume distribution follows a log-normal curve and the medium-power talker is uniquely determined by the average talker volume. The medium-power talker volume, ''V'', is given by ''V'' = ''V'' &lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.115σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''V'' &lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the average of the talker volume distribution in volume units (vu), and σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[variance]] of the distribution.

'''Namibian Sign Language''' ('''NSL''') is a [[sign language]] of [[Namibia]] and [[Angola]]. It is presumed that there are other sign languages in these countries. 

The first school for the deaf was at [[Engela Constituency|Engela]], and was established c. 1970 by the Evangelical Lutheran Church. The first teachers were black Namibians trained in South Africa, and used the [[Paget Gorman Sign System]] with [[Ovambo language|Ovambo]] grammar. Students used the PGSS signs, but developed their own grammar. 

In 1975 the South African government started a new school for the deaf at [[Eluwa]]. All children under 17 attending Engela were moved to Eluwa, and took their language with them. The Namibian exile community in Angola included a number of students from these schools, and in 1982 a school for the deaf was set up for them in Angola, where they taught NSL to new students.

==Process and goals==
NELL was programmed by its developers to be able to identify a basic set of fundamental semantic relationships between a few hundred predefined categories of data, such as cities, companies, emotions and sports teams. Since the beginning of 2010, the Carnegie Mellon research team has been running NELL around the clock, sifting through hundreds of millions of web pages looking for connections between the information it already knows and what it finds through its search process &amp;ndash; to make new connections in a manner that is intended to mimic the way humans learn new information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/rtw/overview Project Overview], [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Accessed October 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in encountering the word pair "Pikes Peak", NELL would notice that both words are capitalized and deduce from the second word that it was the name of a mountain, and then build on the relationship of words surrounding those two words to deduce other connections.&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;

The goal of NELL and other semantic learning systems, such as [[IBM]]'s [[Watson (artificial intelligence software)|Watson]] system, is to be able to develop means of answering questions posed by users in natural language with no human intervention in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Trader, Tiffany. [http://www.hpcwire.com/news/Machine-Learns-Language-Starting-with-the-Facts-104384244.html "Machine Learns Language Starting with the Facts"], HPCwire, October 5, 2010. Accessed October 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oren Etzioni]] of the [[University of Washington]] lauded the system's "continuous learning, as if NELL is exercising curiosity on its own, with little human help".&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;

By October 2010, NELL has doubled the number of relationships it has available in its knowledge base and has learned 440,000 new facts, with an accuracy of 87%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/rtw/ "NELL: Never-Ending Language Learning"], [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Accessed October 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt; Team leader [[Tom M. Mitchell]], chairman of the machine learning department at Carnegie Mellon described how NELL "self-corrects when it has more information, as it learns more", though it does sometimes arrive at incorrect conclusions. Accumulated errors, such as the deduction that [[HTTP cookie|Internet cookies]] were a kind of baked good, led NELL to deduce from the phrases "I deleted my Internet cookies" and "I deleted my files" that "[[computer file]]s" also belonged in the baked goods category.&lt;ref&gt;VanHemert, Kyle. [http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2010/10/right-now-a-computer-is-reading-online-teaching-itself-language/ "Right Now A Computer Is Reading Online, Teaching Itself Language"], [[Gizmodo]], October 6, 2010. Accessed October 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Clear errors like these are corrected every few weeks by the members of the research team and the system is allowed to continue its learning process.&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;

'''Old Polish language''' ({{lang-pl|język staropolski}}) is the period in the [[History of Polish|history]] of the [[Polish language]] between the 9th and the 16th centuries, followed by the [[Middle Polish language]].

==History==
The Polish language started to change after the [[baptism of Poland]], which caused an influx of [[Latin language|Latin]] words, such as ''kościół'' "church" (Latin ''castellum'', "castle"), ''anioł'' "angel" (Latin ''angelus''). Many of them were borrowed via [[Czech language|Czech]], which, too, influenced Polish in that era (hence e.g. ''wiesioły'' "happy, blithe" (cf. ''[[wikt:wiesiołek#pl|wiesiołek]]'') morphed into modern [[Polish language|Polish]] ''wesoły'', with the original vowels and the consonants of Czech ''[[wikt:veselý#cz|veselý]]''). Also, in later centuries, with the onset of cities founded on German law (namely, the so-called [[Magdeburg rights|Magdeburg law]]), [[Middle High German]] urban and legal words filtered into Old Polish. Around the 14th or 15th centuries the [[aorist]] and [[imperfect]] became obsolete. In the 15th century the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] fell into disuse except for a few fixed expressions (adages, sayings). In relation to most other European languages, though, the differences between Old and Modern Polish are comparatively slight; the Polish language is somewhat conservative relative to other Slavic languages.

== Spelling ==
The difficulty the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] scribes had to face was attempting to codify the language was the inadequacy of the [[Latin alphabet]] to some sounds of the Polish language, for example ''cz, sz''. Thus, Old Polish does not have a standard spelling. One letter could give several sounds - e.g. s can be read as ''s'', ''sz'' or ''ś''. Writing words was almost entirely consistent with the spelling of Latin, for example. Bichek - Byczek, Gneuos - Gniewosz etc.

== Earliest written sentence ==
[[File:Book of Henryków.PNG|thumb|"Day, ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai", highlited in red]]
The [[Book of Henryków]] ({{lang-pl|Księga henrykowska}}, {{lang-la|Liber fundationis claustri Sancte Marie Virginis in Heinrichau}}), contains the earliest known sentence written in the Polish language: ''Day, ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai'' (pronounced originally as: ''Daj, uć ja pobrusza, a ti pocziwaj,'' modern Polish: ''Daj, niech ja pomielę, a ty odpoczywaj'' or ''Pozwól, że ja będę mełł, a ty odpocznij'', English: ''Come, let me grind, and you take a rest''), written around 1270.

The medieval recorder of this phrase, the Cistercian monk Peter of the Henryków monastery, noted that "Hoc est in polonico" ("This is in Polish").&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.fides.org.pl/publication/834 Digital version ''Book of Henryków'' in latin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara i Adam Podgórscy: Słownik gwar śląskich. Katowice: Wydawnictwo KOS, 2008, {{ISBN|978-83-60528-54-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan Walczak: Zarys dziejów języka polskiego. Wrocław: Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Wrocławskiego, 1999, {{ISBN|83-229-1867-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alphabet==
=== Parkoszowic ===
About 1440  {{ill|Jakub Parkoszowic|pl}}, a professor of [[Jagiellonian University]], tried to codify the Polish [[alphabet]]. He wrote the first tract on Polish [[Orthography|orthographic]] rules (in [[Latin]]) and rhyme ''Obiecado'' (in Polish). The reform consisted in the introduction of round and unrounded letters on the distinction between hard and soft consonants. It also contained merging double vowels to a long vowel, for example: ''aa'' – /aː/. Parkoszowic's proposal was not adopted, and his theoretical concepts had no followers.

== Phonetics ==
Over the centuries Old Polish pronunciation was subjected to numerous modifications. These are only the most basic ones.

The consonant system transferred into the soft [[coronal consonant]]s, for example {{IPA|/tʲ, dʲ, sʲ, zʲ/}} for {{IPA|/t͡ɕ, d͡ʑ, ɕ, ʑ/}}. Many [[consonant cluster]]s were simplified; which in the process made [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] reverse many consonants in words, before that following a voiceless consonant.

== Literature ==
* The [[Gniezno Bull]] (Polish: ''Bulla gnieźnieńska'') a papal bull containing 410 Polish names, published 7 July 1136 ([[s:pl:Bulla gnieźnieńska|This document can be viewed in Polish wikisource]])
* [[Bogurodzica|Mother of God]] (Polish: ''Bogurodzica'') 10th–13th centuries, the oldest known Polish national anthem
* The [[Book of Henryków]] (Polish: ''Księga henrykowska'', Latin: ''Liber fundationis'') – contains the earliest known sentence written in the Polish language.
* The [[Holy Cross Sermons]] (Polish: ''Kazania świętokrzyskie'') 14th century
* [[St. Florian's Psalter]] (Polish: ''Psałterz floriański'') 14th century – a psalmody; consists of parallel Latin, Polish and German texts
* [[Master Polikarp's Dialog with Death]] (Polish: ''Rozmowa Mistrza Polikarpa ze Śmiercią'', Latin: ''De morte prologus, Dialogus inter Mortem et Magistrum Polikarpum'') verse poetry, early 15th century
* [[Lament of the Holy Cross]] (Polish: ''Lament świętokrzyski'', also known as: ''Żale Matki Boskiej pod krzyżem'' or ''Posłuchajcie Bracia Miła''), late 15th century
* [[Bible of Queen Sophia]] (Polish: ''Biblia królowej Zofii''), first Polish Bible translation, 15th century

== Example ==
: Ach, Królu wieliki nasz
: Coż Ci dzieją Maszyjasz,
: Przydaj rozumu k'mej rzeczy,
: Me sierce bostwem obleczy,
: Raczy mię mych grzechów pozbawić
: Bych mógł o Twych świętych prawić.
(The introduction to ''The Legend of [[Saint Alexius]]'' (15th century)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5176">An '''organic minute''' is defined as the natural state of which telecommunications relay calls are processed between caller and called parties through Communications Assistant (relay agent and video interpreter) that are in conversation mode; that is, no incentives to encourage unnecessary relay minutes.  

The U.S, [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) is currently compensating the use of [[Telecommunications Relay Service]] (TRS) for the [[deaf]], [[hard of hearing]] (hoh) and [[speech-impaired]] for every minutes used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/dro/title4.html |title=Title IV of the ADA |date=November 9, 2005 |accessdate=2005-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretation of what defines organic minutes may vary among telecommunications relay service providers especially trying to benefit from ramping up unnecessary minutes for the sole purpose of making profit.

==How TRS calls work==
{{main|Telecommunications Relay Service}}

==History of 'inorganic' minutes==
In 2009 Tom Chandler, chief of the FCC Disability Rights Office,&lt;ref&gt;[http://deaftimes.com/usa-l/a-failure-of-communication-great-summary-of-vrs-fcc-and-neca/ A Failure of Communication] Deaf Times, Oct 2010&lt;/ref&gt; expressed concerns about relay companies abusing their privileges to the TRS fund.  He mentioned in his internal email distributions that the programs offered through the video relay service was a "classic fleecing of America." The government, he said, was reimbursing companies for it at "ridiculously high rates." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20090125_Phone_program_for_deaf_is_questioned.html Philly.com|title=Phone program for deaf is questioned |date=January 25, 2009 |accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venture capitalists===
Video Relay Service companies, especially with venture capitalists behind the service, view this business opportunity as a quick way of making lucrative profits for their "good will".  Companies are becoming ''creative'' with how to ramp up minutes since every minute is compensated by the FCC.

===Examples of inorganic calls===
====Tele-marketing====
Relay companies would purposefully contract a telemarketing firm and create "job opportunities" for the deaf and hard of hearing by opening up positions.  The deaf and hard of hearing staff under a telemarketing firm would call through the contracted relay provider thus generate minutes.  In return, the telemarketing firm would appreciate a percentage of the profit from the TRS fund.

====Conference calls====
Another strategy by relay companies to create "job opportunities" would involve hiring anybody who knows sign language to engage in conference calls during the day on a daily basis.  Whatever their job titles are, they are encouraged to call internally to a conference call bridge through their own Video Relay Service interpreter to communicate with each other.

====Tele-seminars/Podcasts====
Similar to the conference call strategy, the relay company would promote "educational seminars" for the deaf and hard of hearing over the phone via a conference call bridge.  Each seminars usually last 60 minutes long.  A large number of deaf and hard of hearing individuals are invited and they call the relay provider, who is promoting the tele-seminar.

The tele-seminars are provided at no cost to provide incentives for the deaf and hard of hearing to lure them into making an "educational" call.  The minutes used through the tele-seminars are compensated along with lucrative profits.

====Customer service/Survey group====
Relay providers are not giving enough "job opportunities" for the deaf and hard of hearing in the Customer Service department.  The reason is that the relay provider would prefer to place a hearing representative who will use the relay service to communicate to the deaf customers.  This may be argued that it is in fact organic minutes; however, this is an example of "manufacturing minutes".  The deaf and hard of hearing population would rather speak directly to another deaf and hard of hearing individual in their naive language.

==Original purpose of TRS==
The original purpose of TRS is simply provide a two-way communication between deaf, hard of hearing, and speech-disabled individuals to leverage a functional equivalence experience.  The service is not intended for any companies to make lucrative profits out of the TRS fund that are not true to the spirit of relay service. 

According to the TRS Rules; § 64.601 Definitions and provisions of general applicability; Section (15) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/dro/4regs.html |title=TRS Rules |date=September 16, 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is noted that "..services that enable two-way communication between an individual who uses a text telephone or other nonvoice terminal device and an individual who does not use such a device, speech-to-speech services, video relay services and non-English relay services".  The underlying concept of TRS is to provide a true telephone conversation between the caller and called parties (deaf/hoh/speech-disabled and hearing persons).

As these fighters do not compete directly, judging the best fighter pound for pound is subjective, and ratings vary.

Originally the method of queering dealt more strictly with [[gender]] and [[sexuality]], but quickly expanded to become more of an [[umbrella term]] for addressing identity as well as a range of systems of [[oppression]] and [[identity politics]].&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Even the term queer itself can be queered, because much of queer theory involves working to fight against normalization even in the field itself.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critically Queer|last=Butler|first=Judith|work=The Routledge Queer Studies Reader|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Hall|editor-first=Donald E.|location=|pages=18–31|editor-last2=Jagose|editor-first2=Annamarie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of queer theory, "queering is something we do, rather than something we are (or are not)." &lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

An example of "queering" would be to reexamine the primary sources from the life of King [[Richard I of England]], to search for evidence that he exhibited homosexual behavior or attitudes. Queering, as a tool of [[historical analysis]], does not necessarily mean an attempt to determine if historical figure actually engaged in homosexual behaviors.  It embraces a more fluid spectrum of gender attitudes which may have been entirely emotional, i.e. if celibate monks who wrote letters of intimate affection could be said to be exhibiting a form of romantic love, even if they never engaged in intimate physical behavior, or even consciously considered their behavior to be a parallel of romantic physical relationships.

Queering has drawn some criticism from contemporary scholarship for projecting modern biases backwards onto historical figures ([[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]]), or seeing only what researchers want to see.  Conversely, other scholarship has argued that it is a useful tool for challenging previously held assumptions that the concepts of gender behavior held by peoples in different historical eras were exactly like modern conceptions.  To turn to the example of Richard the Lionheart, early 20th century scholarship barely questioned that he might have taken part in homosexual behavior.  At the other extreme, later scholarship reexamined the evidence and concluded that he was a "homosexual" in the modern sense.  These two extremes were debated and refined, with a general consensus emerging that Richard probably engaged in sexual activity with both men and women at different times in his life, but that Richard's self-conception wasn't necessarily an exact equivalent to the modern sense of homosexual identity.

== Origins and other uses ==
Historically queer was a word that referred to something as odd or strange. As the verb form of queer, queering can refer to the act of taking something and looking at it through a lens that makes it strange or troubles it in some way.&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt; By the 1940s (in the United States), ''queer'' came to be used in reference to sexuality that deviated from heterosexual norms.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Queering Catcher: Flits, Straights, and Other Morons|last=Hekanaho|first=Pia Livia|work=J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye: A Routledge Study Guide|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=0415344530|editor-last=Graham|editor-first=Sarah|location=|pages=89–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the period of the late 80’s and early 90’s when LGBT AIDS activist groups, such as [[ACT UP|Act Up]] and [[Queer Nation]], began to reclaim the term queer as a positive [[identifier]] and as a process of questioning mainstream ideas about what was considered normal.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Cathy Cohen argues that groups like these also extended the use of queer to move past “assimilationist tendencies" present in AIDS activism.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; This is based on sentiments expressed by groups like Queer Nation who felt that queer as a word and a sentiment was too focused on [[mwod:assimilate#h1|assimilation]] of non-[[Normative social influence|normative]] sexualities and identities.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Within such groups, queer as a noun was reclaimed again to mean something radical. Queering then became a tool for social and political [[subversion]] of [[dominant culture]]. Because it  is rooted in queer theory, it is also closely tied into queer politics and queer activism.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

Because the idea of queering comes from the term queer, it has a wide variety of definitions as well as uses. For example, [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], a foundational [[Theory|theorist]] of queer theory&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; says that queer can mean "the open mesh of possibilities, gaps…and excesses of meaning when the constituent elements of anyone’s gender, of anyone’s sexuality aren't made (or ''can't be'' made) to signify monolithically."&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Literary critic [[Michael Warner]] offers this definition: "Queer gets a critical edge by defining itself against the normal rather than the heterosexual."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction|last=Warner|first=Michael|work=Fear of a Queer Planet: Queer Politics and Social Theory|publisher=Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press|year=1993|isbn=|editor-last=Warner|pages=Xxiii-xxxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Butler, another theorist credited with the founding of queer theory, talks about queer as being an act that that can be performed.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; In a more current context, methods of queering extend beyond critiquing literature to examine topics from popular culture to more abstract topics like theology and time.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Thelathia “Nikki”|date=April 2012|title=Queering "The Human Situation"|url=|journal=Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion|volume=28|pages=126–131|issn=1553-3913|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Queer Rurality and the Materiality of Time|last=Soderling|first=Stina|work=Queering the Countryside: New Frontiers in Rural Queer Studies|publisher=New York University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4798-3077-0|editor-last=Gray|editor-first=Mary L.|location=|pages=|editor-last2=Johnson|editor-first2=Colin R.|editor-last3=Gilley|editor-first3=Brian J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her essay about the benefits of queering theology, Thelathia "Nikki" Young, says that queering is a way to "[deconstruct] the logics and frameworks operating within old and new theological and ethical concepts." In addition to these deconstructions, she argues that queering "dismantles the dynamics of power and privilege persisting among diverse subjectivities."

&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt;

=== Uses in literature ===
In Pia Livia Hekanaho's essay "Queering Catcher: Flits, Straights, and Other Morons," she uses queering to analyze “the leaking boundaries of 'straight' (heterosexual) masculinity and the queer identities that may lie beyond those boundaries”  in [[J. D. Salinger|J.D. Salinger’s]] 1951 novel [[The Catcher in the Rye|''Catcher in the Rye'']]. In it, she looks at how the narrator Holden Caufield is caught between the strictness of normative masculinity and a fear of non-normative sexualities and manhood.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; Judith Butler uses a queer reading of the 1929 novel [[Passing (novel)|''Passing'']] by [[Nella Larsen|Nella Larson]] to see the possibilities of blurring the binaries of both race and attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Passing, Queering: Nella Larson's Psychoanalytic Challenge|last=Butler|first=Judith|work=Passing: A Norton Critical Edition|publisher=New York: Norton|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=Kaplan|editor-first=Carla|pages=417–435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disco music ==
Queering also occurred in popular music in [[disco]] culture. Prior to the [[Stonewall Rebellion]]s in New York that arguably mark the birth of disco, heterosexual norms dominated the [[club scene]]. It was only after disco music came out did queering begin to take its mark. This was seen especially on the dance floors at straight and gay clubs alike. Whereas before, the norm was for a man and a female to take the dance floor together, queering allowed for individuals to dance by themselves, or for same sex dance partners to take the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Tim|date=2011|title=Disco and the Queering of the Dance Floor|url=|journal=Cultural Studies|volume=|pages=|via=Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Deportation of Acadians order, painting by Jefferys.jpg|thumb|right|The deportation order is read to a group of Acadians in 1755]]

'''The Royal Proclamation of 2003''', formally known as ''Proclamation Designating 28 July of Every Year as "A Day of Commemoration of the Great Upheaval", Commencing on 28 July 2005'', is a document issued in the name of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] acknowledging the [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Great Upheaval]] (or Great Expulsion or Grand Dérangement), Britain's expulsion of French-speaking [[Acadian]]s from [[Nova Scotia]], beginning in 1755.

==Historical background==
The [[proclamation]]'s origin dates back to a 1763 [[petition]] submitted to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] by Acadian exiles in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. Because the King never responded to the petition, Warren A. Perrin, a [[Cajun]] attorney and cultural activist from [[Erath, Louisiana]], in the 1990s resurrected the petition and threatened to [[Filing (legal)|sue]] Elizabeth II (great-great-great-great-granddaughter of George III), as Queen in Right of the United Kingdom, if the British government refused to acknowledge the illegality of the Grand Dérangement.

After 13 years of discussions, Perrin and his supporters in the United States and Canada persuaded the Government of Canada to issue a royal proclamation acknowledging the historical fact of the Great Upheaval and consequent suffering experienced by the Acadian people. The document itself was signed by [[Adrienne Clarkson]], then [[Governor General of Canada]].

==Text of the proclamation==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom, Canada and her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], Defender of the Faith.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To All To Whom these Presents shall come or whom the same may in any way concern, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Greeting: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Morris Rosenberg]]&lt;br&gt;
Deputy [[Attorney General of Canada|Attorney General]] of Canada&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
A Proclamation &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Whereas the Acadian people, through the vitality of their community, have made a remarkable contribution to Canadian society for almost 400 years;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Whereas on 28 July 1755, the Crown, in the course of administering the affairs of the British colony of Nova Scotia, made the decision to deport the Acadian people;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Whereas the deportation of the Acadian people, commonly known as the Great Upheaval, continued until 1763 and had tragic consequences, including the deaths of many thousands of Acadians – from disease, in shipwrecks, in their places of refuge and in prison camps in Nova Scotia and England as well as in the British colonies in America;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Whereas We acknowledge these historical facts and the trials and suffering experienced by the Acadian people during the Great Upheaval;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Whereas We hope that the Acadian people can turn the page on this dark chapter of their history;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Whereas Canada is no longer a British colony but a sovereign state, by and under the [[Constitution of Canada]];&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Whereas when Canada became a sovereign state, with regard to Canada, the Crown in right of Canada and of the provinces succeeded to the powers and prerogatives of the Crown in right of the United Kingdom;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Whereas We, in Our role as Queen of Canada, exercise the executive power by and under the Constitution of Canada;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Whereas this Our present Proclamation does not, under any circumstances, constitute a recognition of legal or financial responsibility by the Crown in right of Canada and of the provinces and is not, under any circumstances, a recognition of, and does not have any effect upon, any right or obligation of any person or group of persons;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
And Whereas, by [[Order in Council]] P.C. 2003-1967 of 6 December 2003, the Governor in Council has directed that a proclamation do issue designating 28 July of every year as "A Day of Commemoration of the Great Upheaval", commencing on 28 July 2005;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Now Know You that We, by and with the advice of [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|Our Privy Council for Canada]], do by this Our Proclamation, effective on 5 September 2004, designate 28 July of every year as "A Day of Commemoration of the Great Upheaval", commencing on 28 July 2005.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Of All Which Our Loving Subjects and all others whom these Presents may concern are hereby required to take notice and to govern themselves accordingly.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
In Testimony Whereof, We have caused this Our Proclamation to be published and the [[Great Seal of Canada]] to be hereunto affixed. Witness: Our Right Trusty and Well-beloved [[Adrienne Clarkson]], [[Chancellor]] and Principal Companion of Our [[Order of Canada]], Chancellor and [[Commander]] of Our [[Order of Military Merit (Canada)|Order of Military Merit]], Chancellor and Commander of Our [[Order of Merit of the Police Forces]], [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] and [[Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces|Commander-in-Chief]] of Canada.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
At Our [[Rideau Hall|Government House]], in Our City of [[Ottawa]], this tenth day of December in the year of Our Lord two thousand and three and in the fifty-second year of Our Reign.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
By Command, &lt;br&gt;
Jean-Claude Villiard&lt;br&gt;
Deputy [[Registrar General of Canada|Registrar General]] of Canada
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Spellbound''''' is a 2002 documentary that was directed by [[Jeffrey Blitz]]. The film follows eight competitors in the [[72nd Scripps National Spelling Bee|1999 Scripps National Spelling Bee]]. The film received positive reviews and won several awards. 

== Spellers ==
The spellers were Neil Kadakia, Emily Stagg, Ashley White, April DeGideo, Harry Altman, Angela Arenivar, Nupur Lala and Ted Brigham. As they appear from left to right on the DVD's cover:

=== Neil Kadakia ===
Neil (as speller # 139) missed "[[wiktionary: hellebore|hellebore]]" in the bee to get ninth place. Other words Neil spelled include: [[wiktionary: encephalon|encephalon]], [[wiktionary: desecration|desecration]], [[wiktionary: mercenary|mercenary]], [[wiktionary: Darjeeling|Darjeeling]], and [[wiktionary: hypsometer|hypsometer]].  He was sponsored by the ''[[Orange County Register]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocde.us/SpellingBee/Pages/default.aspx/|title=Orange County Spelling Bee|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neil is a graduate of UC Berkeley. Before he went to college, he went on a jet ski expedition with his father and his sister, Shivani, also a speller.  He is currently the COO of Greens Global, a real estate company based out of San Clemente, CA. On July 3, 2011, he married Archana Sheth, also a UC Berkeley graduate. He is also an avid chess player, and has earned over 15 chess trophies in his life.

;
His grandfather paid 1000 people in India to pray for him.

=== Emily Stagg ===
Emily Stagg (speller # 148) was sponsored by the ''[[New Haven Register]]'' in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and spelled: [[wiktionary: seguidilla|seguidilla]], [[wiktionary: disclaimant|disclaimant]], [[wiktionary: kookaburra|kookaburra]], [[wiktionary: viand|viand]], [[wiktionary: apocope|apocope]], [[wiktionary: brunneous|brunneous]], [[wiktionary: clavecin|clavecin]] (spelled incorrectly as "clavison").  She came in 6th place.  In 2006, as a junior in [[Carleton College]], she wrote an op-ed article for the New York Times [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/31/opinion/31stagg.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp; questioning the usefulness] of the National Spelling Bee.

=== Ashley White ===
Ashley White (speller 149) represented ''The Washington Informer'' in [[Washington, DC]] in the spelling bee. Following Ashley's [[teenage pregnancy]] (she was 18), a marketing consultant who had seen the movie managed to rally support from other viewers of the documentary to help Ashley into Howard University. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A13893-2004Jun3.html] The proctor of the Washington Informer regional spelling bee featured in the film is [[Mac McGarry]]

=== April DeGideo ===
April DeGideo, who lives in [[Ambler, Pennsylvania|Ambler]], [[Pennsylvania]], participated in the 1998 and 1999 bees, in the latter of which she placed third, representing the ''Times Herald'' of [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]], Pennsylvania. April graduated in 2007 from [[New York University]] with a degree in Journalism. She then went on to get a second degree in creative writing and later went on to publish two books. ''The study guide'', and ''Where to start’’.

=== Harry Altman ===
Many critics who reviewed ''Spellbound'' singled out Altman (speller # 8) as its most interesting "character". Yet in the finals Altman is stumped by the word 'banns'. [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that he "has so many eccentricities that he'd be comic relief in a teenage comedy... He screws his face up into so many shapes while trying to spell a word that it's a wonder the letters can find their way to the surface."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/spellbound-2003|title=Spellbound|author=Roger Ebert|date=16 May 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to the [[Bergen County Academies|Academy for Engineering and Design Technology]] in [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]], [[New Jersey]]. In autumn 2005, he enrolled in the [[University of Chicago]]. In 2014 Harry completed a PhD in Mathematics from the [[University of Michigan]], focusing on integer complexity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~haltman/ University of Michigan Ann Arbor pursuing&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Angela Arenivar ===
Angela Arenivar represented the ''Amarillo Globe-News'' in the 1998 and 1999 bees.   Angela graduated from Texas A&amp;M University in 2007 with a bachelor's degree in Spanish and earned a master's in Spanish from the University of New Mexico in 2009.  She has taught Spanish in Texas public high schools.  Angela now attends Texas A&amp;M University pursuing her Ph.D. in Hispanic Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelaarenivar.com/|title=Hello!  Not heleoplankton.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nupur Lala ===
Nupur Lala was the champion of the 1999 Scripps National Spelling Bee (as speller # 155), spelling "[[wiktionary: logorrhea|logorrhea]]" to win. Nupur won the bee against David Lewandowski, a speller from Indiana who misspelled "[[opsimath]]."  She turned down an MTV reality show that would have followed her college years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wjla.com/articles/2013/05/nupur-lala-reflects-on-winning-national-spelling-bee-89296.html | title=Nupur Lala reflects on winning National Spelling Bee | date=May 27, 2013 | accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2003, she entered [[University of Michigan at Ann Arbor]] to study brain and cognitive sciences and pre-medical studies and graduated in 2007 with a degree in Brain, Behavior and Cognitive Science.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/gabrieli-lab/People/technical-assistant.html Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Gabrieli Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Laboratory website&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fall of 2014 she entered the College of Medicine at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.

=== Ted Brigham ===
Ted Brigham was speller # 1. He represented the ''Rolla Daily Record'' of [[Rolla, Missouri|Rolla]], [[Missouri]]. One of the more notable stories from his experience is the congratulations posted by students on the marquee in front of his high school in which "champ" was misspelled (presumably as an ironic joke) as "chapm".  Ted attended medical school in Kansas City, Missouri until his mysterious death in December 2007. His family chose not to disclose the circumstances of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/KansasCity/DeathNotices.asp?Page=LifeStory&amp;PersonID=99091039|title=Theodore Earl Brigham Obituary: View Theodore Brigham's Obituary by Kansas City Star|work=Kansas City Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other notable spellers ===
* '''George Thampy''' was speller # 245 in the bee and was mentioned several times within the film. He misspelled "kirtle" as "curtle" for third place, tying with April DeGideo. Thampy eventually won the 2000 national bee.
* '''David Lewandowski''' finished second place in the spelling bee, spelling "opsimath" as "opsomath". After David's mistake, Nupur spelled "logorrhea" to win the competition.
* '''Allyson Lieberman''' was originally slated to be featured as one of the spellers in the documentary, but her clips were ultimately left out of the film; the scene involving her can be found in the special features of the DVD. The youngest contestant in the entire 1998 bee, she misspelled "purblind".
* '''Frances Taschuk''' and '''Ann Foley''' are shown in the final set of scenes prior to the last round of the spelling bee. Frances misspells "acoelous" and Ann "quinquevir".
* '''Vinay Krupadev''' is in a scene involving Harry's mother feeling "sorry for the boy from Texas who got 'yenta'". She was referring to Vinay, who is actually from Marietta, Ohio, and his pronunciation of "yenta," shown in the film. He eventually spelled it "yente".
* '''Jess Altman''' was mentioned in a scene by Harry Altman for being a terrific speller and that he was disappointed she didn't make the Nationals.
* '''Sonia Nagala''' won the North Dakota bee with the word "butyraceous", but was eliminated in the second round of the Nationals.  She is currently{{when|date=May 2017}} completing her MBA at Harvard Business School.

* [[Frank Neuhauser]], winner of the first National Spelling Bee, held in 1925, also appears in the film.&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{cite news|first=Emma|last=Brown|title=Frank Neuhauser, winner of first national spelling bee, dies at 97 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/frank-neuhauser-winner-of-first-national-spelling-bee-dies-at-97/2011/03/21/AB9J9BAB_story.html |work=[[Washington Post]] |publisher= |date=2011-03-21 |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Edmond Jones.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Early stagecraft master [[Robert Edmond Jones]] (1887–1954) drawing at a high table ({{circa|1920)}}.]]
'''Stagecraft''' is the technical aspect of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes constructing and [[Rigging (theatre)|rigging]] scenery; hanging and focusing of lighting; design and procurement of costumes; make-up; [[stage management]]; [[audio engineering]]; and procurement of [[theatrical properties|props]]. Stagecraft is distinct from the wider umbrella term of [[scenography]]. Considered a technical rather than an artistic field, it is primarily the practical implementation of a [[scenic designer]]'s artistic vision.

In its most basic form, stagecraft may be executed by a single person (often the [[stage manager]] of a smaller production) who arranges all scenery, costumes, lighting, and sound, and organizes the cast. [[Regional theatre in the United States|Regional theatre]]s and larger [[community theatre]]s will generally have a technical director and a complement of designers, each of whom has a direct hand in their respective designs.
Within significantly larger productions, for example a modern [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show, effectively bringing a show to opening night requires the work of skilled carpenters, painters, electricians, stagehands, stitchers, wigmakers, and the like. Modern stagecraft is highly technical and specialized: it comprises many sub-disciplines and a vast trove of history and tradition.

==History==
Greeks were the earliest recorded practitioners of stagecraft. "[[Skene (theatre)|Skene]]" is Greek, translating roughly into "scene" or "scenery", and refers to a large scenic house, about one story tall, with three doors. On the audience-side of the Skene, what are now known as "[[Flats (theatre)|flats]]" could be hung. Flats developed to two-sided painted flats which would be mounted, centered, on a rotating pin, with rope running around each consecutive pin, so the flats could be turned for a scene-change. The double-sided-flat eventually evolved into the [[periaktos]] (pl. periaktoi).

As well as flats, the Greeks also used such machines as the ''[[ekkyklema]]'', essentially a platform on wheels, and the deus ex machina, a hand-cranked lift to be used to lift a character/scenery over the skene. Over 20 such scenic inventions can be traced back to the Greeks. No light but that of the sun was used; plays started at sun-rise and continued until sun-down.

Plays of [[Medieval]] times were held in different places such as the streets of towns and cities, performed by traveling, secular troupes. Some were also held in monasteries, performed by church-controlled groups, often portraying religious scenes. The playing place could represent many different things such as indoors or outdoors ([[plain-an-gwarry (theatre)]]). They were played in certain places so the props could be used for the play. Songs and spectacles were often used in plays to enhance participation.&lt;ref&gt;Cp;dewey,John. Drama Classical to Contemporary. New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

More modern stagecraft was in developed in England between 1576–1642. There were three different types of theaters in London – public, private and court. The size and shape varied but many were suggested to be round theaters. Public playhouses such as the [[Globe Theatre]] used rigging housed in a room on the roof to lower and raise in scenery or actors, and utilized the raised stage by developing the practice of using trap-doors in theatrical productions. Most of the theatres had circular-design, with an open area above the pit to allow sunlight to enter and light the stage. It was a penny admission to stand in the pit. Prices increase for seating. Court plays were used for holidays and special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Styan, John."Shakespeare's Stagecraft." Oct 7 200. 30 Nov 2007 {{ISBN|0521094356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Proscenium]] stages, or picture-box stages, were constructed in France around the time of the [[English Restoration]], and maintain the place of the most popular form of stage in use to-date, and originally combined elements of the skene in design, essentially building a skene on-stage. Lighting of the period would have consisted of candles, used as foot-lights, and hanging from chandeliers above the stage.

Stagecraft during the Victorian era in England developed rapidly with the emergence of the [[West End theatre|West End]]. Prompted by and influx of urbanites in the greater [[London]] area, [[Parliament]] was forced to do away with previous licensing laws and allowed all theatres to perform [[straight plays]] in 1843. [[Electric lighting]] and [[hydraulics]] were introduced to draw large audiences to see on-stage storms, explosions, and miraculous transformations. Technologies developed during the latter part of the 19th-century paved the way for the development of [[special effects]] to be used in [[film]].&lt;ref&gt;Bratton, Jacky. "Theatre in the 19th Century." ''The British Library''. 4 December 2015 Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lighting continued to develop. In England, a form lamp using a blowpipe to heat lime to incandescence was developed, for navigation purposes – it was soon adapted to theatrical performances and the [[limelight]] became a widespread form of artificial light for theatres.  To control the focus of the light, a [[Fresnel lens]] was used.

Originally intended to replace large, convex lenses in lighthouses, [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel|Dr. Fresnel]] sectioned out the convex lens in a series of circles, like tree-rings, and keeping the angle of the specific section, moved the section much closer to the flat side of the [[convex lens]].

After candles, came gas lighting, utilizing pipes with small openings which were lit before every performance, and could be dimmed by controlling the flow of gas, so long as the flame never went out. With the turn of the 20th century, many theatre companies making the transition from gas to electricity would install the new system right next to the old one, resulting in many explosions and fires due to the electricity igniting the gas lines.

Modern [[Stage lighting|theatrical lighting]] is electrically-based. Many lamps and lighting instruments are in use today, and the field is rapidly becoming one of the most diverse and complex in the industry.

==Sub-disciplines==
{{outline|Outline of stagecraft}}
Stagecraft comprises many disciplines, typically divided into a number of main disciplines:

* '''[[Stage lighting|Lighting]]''': [[Lighting design]], which involves the process of determining the angle, size, intensity, shape, and color of light for a given scene. Hanging, focusing, procurement and maintenance of lighting and [[special effect]]s equipment, aspects of [[show control]]
* '''[[Make-up artist|Make-up]]/[[Wig]]s''':  The application of makeup and wigs to accentuate an actor's features.
* '''Mechanics''': Design, engineering and operation of [[Fly system|Flown]] scenery or flying of performers and mechanised scenic elements and special effects.
* '''Production''', comprising [[stage management]], [[production management (theater)|production management]], [[show control]], [[house management]] and [[company management]]
* '''[[Theatrical scenery|Scenery]]''', which includes [[set construction]], [[scenic painting]], [[theater drapes and stage curtains]], and [[special effect]]s.
* '''[[Sound designer|Sound design]]''', which can include musical [[underscoring]], vocal and instrument [[Audio mixing (film and television)|mixing]] as well as theatrical [[sound effect]]s. The sound designer is also responsible for the system design and build.
* '''[[Theatrical property]]''', or props, which includes furnishings, set dressings, and all items large and small which cannot be classified as scenery, electrics or wardrobe. Some crossover may apply. Props handled by actors are known as hand props, and props which are kept in an actor's costume are known as personal props.
* '''[[Wardrobe (clothing)|Wardrobe]]''': [[costume design]], [[costume construction|construction]], procurement and maintenance.
*'''[[Video design|Video]]''' (or [[Video design|Projection]]) is a relatively recent field of stagecraft which is gaining recognition. As well as being a discipline in itself, its role may also be taken on by the [[Lighting designer|Lighting]] or [[Scenic designer|Scenery]] disciplines.
* '''[[Stage automation]]''': is the use and control of moving electronics that have the ability to move set pieces, set dressings and stage floor among many other stage elements. Stage automation may also include rigging when a motor is used to control lines or objects.

{{Sociology}}
In any given society, a '''taboo''' is an implicit prohibition on something (usually against an utterance or behavior) based on a cultural sense that it is excessively repulsive or, perhaps, too sacred for ordinary people.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. "[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/579821/taboo Taboo]." Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Retrieved 21 Mar. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, 11th Edition. "[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/taboo Taboo]."&lt;/ref&gt; Such prohibitions are present in virtually all societies.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; On a comparative basis taboos, for example related to food items, seem to make no sense at all as what may be declared unfit for one group by [[Custom (law)|custom]] or [[religion]] may be perfectly acceptable to another.

Whether scientifically correct or not, taboos are often meant to protect the human individual, but there are numerous other reasons for their existence. An ecological or medical background is apparent in many, including some that are seen as religious or spiritual in origin. Taboos can help utilize a resource more efficiently, but when applied to only a subsection of the community they can also serve to suppress a subsection of the [[community]]. A taboo acknowledged by a particular group or [[tribe]] as part of their ways, aids in the cohesion of the group, helps that particular group to stand out and maintain its identity in the face of others and therefore creates a feeling of "belonging".&lt;ref name="Meyer-Rochow 2009" /&gt;

The meaning of the word "taboo" has been somewhat expanded in the [[social science]]s to strong prohibitions relating to any area of human activity or custom that is sacred or forbidden based on [[Morality|moral judgment]], religious beliefs, or cultural [[norm (sociology)|norms]].&lt;ref name="Meyer-Rochow 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meyer-Rochow| first= Victor Benno | title= Food taboos: their origins and purposes|journal= Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine | date=2009| volume=5-18:|

==Etymology==
The term "taboo" comes from the [[Tongan language|Tongan]] ''[[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]'' or [[Fijian language|Fijian]] ''tabu'' ("prohibited", "disallowed", "forbidden"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; related among others to the [[Maori language|Maori]] ''tapu'', [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] ''kapu'', and [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] ''fady''. Its English use dates to 1777 when the British explorer [[Captain James Cook|James Cook]] visited [[Tonga]], and referred to the [[Tongans]]' use of the term "taboo" for "any thing is forbidden to be eaten, or made use of".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|King|1821|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=h6UFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA462 462]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:
{{Quote|Not one of them would sit down, or eat a bit of any thing.... On expressing my surprise at this, they were all taboo, as they said; which word has a very comprehensive meaning; but, in general, signifies that a thing is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|King|1821|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=h6UFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA348 348]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term was translated to him as "consecrated, inviolable, forbidden, unclean or cursed."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Cook|King|1821}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tabu'' itself has been derived from alleged Tongan [[Morpheme|morphemes]] ''ta'' ("mark") and ''bu'' ("especially"), but this may be a [[False etymology|folk etymology]] (Tongan does not actually have a [[phoneme]] /b/), and ''tapu'' is usually treated as a unitary, non-[[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] word inherited from [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] *''tapu'', in turn inherited from [[Proto-Oceanic language|Proto-Oceanic]] *''tabu'', with the [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] meaning "sacred, forbidden."&lt;ref&gt;[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]. "[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=taboo&amp;searchmode=none Taboo]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

On the main island, the word is often appended to the end of "Tonga" as ''Tongatapu'', here meaning "Sacred South" rather than "Forbidden South".

[[Sigmund Freud]] speculated that [[incest taboo|incest]] and [[patricide]] were the only two universal taboos and formed the basis of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''[[Totem and Taboo]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, although [[cannibalism]], in-group [[murder]], and [[incest]] are taboo in the majority of societies, exceptions can be found, such as marriages between brothers and sisters in [[Roman Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;

Common taboos involve restrictions or ritual regulation of killing and hunting; sex and sexual relationships; reproduction; the [[taboo on the dead|dead]] and their graves; as well as food and dining (primarily cannibalism and [[dietary laws]] such as [[vegetarianism]], ''[[kashrut]]'', and ''[[halal]]'') or religious ([[treif]] and [[haram]]). In [[Madagascar]], a strong code of taboos, known as ''[[fady (taboo)|fady]]'', constantly change and are formed from new experiences. Each region, village or tribe may have its own ''fady''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The word "taboo" gained popularity at times, with some scholars looking for ways to apply it where other English words had previously been applied. For example, [[John Merlin Powis Smith|J. M. Powis Smith]], in his book ''The American Bible'' (editor's preface 1927), used "taboo" occasionally in relation to Israel's [[Tabernacle]] and ceremonial laws, including {{Bibleverse|Exodus|30:36}}, {{Bibleverse|Exodus|29:37}}; {{Bibleverse|Numbers|16:37–38}}; {{Bibleverse|Deuteronomy|22:9}}, {{Bibleverse|Isaiah|65:5}}, {{Bibleverse|Ezekiel|44:19}} and {{Bibleverse|Ezekiel|46:20}}.

[[Albert Schweitzer]] wrote a chapter about taboos of the people of Gabon. As an example, it was considered a misfortune for twins to be born, and they would be subject to many rules not incumbent on other people.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Albert. ''African Notebook'' 1958. Indiana University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
[[Communist]] and [[materialist]] theorists have argued that taboos can be used to reveal the histories of societies when other records are lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Marta Dyczok|author2=Oxana Gaman-Golutvina|title=Media, Democracy and Freedom: The Post-Communist Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meUcrEBRpgMC|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-3-0343-0311-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=meUcrEBRpgMC&amp;pg=PA209 209]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marvin Harris]] particularly endeavored to explain taboos as a consequence of ecologic and economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://sociology101.net/readings/Indias-sacred-cow.pdf |author=Marvin Harris |title=India's Sacred Cow |access-date=2015-07-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610221816/http://sociology101.net/readings/Indias-sacred-cow.pdf |archive-date=2015-06-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernity==
Some argue that contemporary [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] societies have taboos against [[tribalism]]s (for example, [[ethnocentrism]] and [[nationalism]]) and [[prejudice]]s ([[racism]], [[sexism]], [[religious extremism]]).&lt;ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | last= Putnam | first = Robert D. | author-link = Robert D.

Changing social customs and standards also create new taboos, such as bans on [[history of slavery|slavery]]; extension of the [[pedophilia]] taboo to [[ephebophilia]];&lt;ref name="www.usccb.org"&gt;{{cite web|first=Frederick |last=S.

In medicine, professionals who practice in ethical and moral [[Loophole|grey areas]], or fields subject to [[social stigma]] such as [[late termination of pregnancy]], may refrain from public discussion of their practice.

Most of his work consisted of church music that included hymns, antiphonal chants, choral anthems in [[Yoruba language]] and two organ solo works, Passacaglia on an African Folk Song and Variations on an African Folk Song.{{sfn|Sadoh|2007}}
Phillips wrote three short organ solo compositions, but most of his organ pieces were based on existing indigenous themes.{{sfn|Sadoh|2008|p=3}}
He made the first modern arrangement of ''Ise Oluwa'', the most popular Yoruba Christian hymn, for [[SATB]] with organ accompaniment.{{sfn|Sadoh|2008|p=53}}
Phillips was the author of ''Yoruba Music'' (Johannesburg: African Music Society, 1953), the first musicological treatise by a trained African musician to discuss African music. 
The book describes Yoruba traditional music in detail and shows how the concepts in this indigenous tradition can be incorporated in modern works.{{sfn|Sadoh|2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6165">[[File:Synoptic Theory Mk-Lk en.svg|thumb|right|The Wilke hypothesis holds that the [[Gospel of Mark]] was used as a source by the [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and both for [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]].]]

The '''Wilke hypothesis''', named after [[Christian Gottlob Wilke]], is a proposed solution to the [[synoptic problem]], holding that the [[Gospel of Mark]] was used as a source by the [[Gospel of Luke]], then both of these were used as sources by the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. Thus, it posits [[Marcan priority]] and Matthaean posteriority.

==History==

[[Gottlob Christian Storr|Storr]], in his groundbreaking 1786 argument for [[Marcan priority]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O4dAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP5 | title=Über den Zweck der evangelischen Geschichte und der Briefe Johannis | last=Storr | first=Gottlob Christian | authorlink=Gottlob Christian Storr | year=1786 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked, if Mark was a source for Matthew and Luke, how the latter two were then related. Storr proposed, among other possibilities, that canonical Greek Matthew was adapted from an earlier [[Aramaic Matthew]] (the ''[[logia]]'' spoken of by [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]]) by following Mark primarily but also drawing from Luke,{{sfnp|Storr|1786|pp=270–307, 355–361, 369–370, 375-377}} although he later went on to oppose this.&lt;ref&gt;For a history of the hypothesis, see {{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2IlMGQAOgw8C&amp;pg=PA173 | title=Q Or Not Q?: The So-called Triple, Double, and Single Traditions in the Synoptic Gospels | year=2010 | pages=173–184 | isbn=3631604920 | last=Adamczewski | first=Bartosz | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas were little noticed until 1838, when C. G. Wilke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NVssAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=Der Urevangelist oder exegetisch kritische Untersuchung über das Verwandtschaftsverhältniß der drei ersten Evangelien | authorlink=Christian Gottlob Wilke | year=1838 | last=Wilke | first=Christian Gottlob | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; revived the hypothesis of Marcan priority and extensively developed the argument for Matthaean posteriority. Wilke's contemporary [[Christian Hermann Weisse|Weisse]] at the same time independently argued for Marcan priority but for Matthew and Luke independently using Mark and another source [[Q source|Q]]—the [[two-source hypothesis]]. A few other German scholars supported Wilke's hypothesis in the nineteenth century, but in time most came to accept the two-source hypothesis, which remains the dominant theory to this day.  Wilke's hypothesis was accepted by [[Karl Kautsky]] in his ''Foundations of Christianity''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1908/christ/ch02.htm Karl Kautsky ''Foundations of Christianity'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilke's hypothesis received little further attention until recent decades, when it was revived in 1992 by Huggins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Matthean Posteriority: a Preliminary Proposal | journal=Novum Testamentum | year=1992 | volume=34 | issue=1 | pages=1–22 | doi=10.1163/156853692X00131 | jstor=1561093 | last=Huggins | first=Ronald V. | ref=harv}} Reprinted in {{cite book | title=The Synoptic Problem and Q: Selected Studies from Novum Testamentum | year=1999 | pages=204–225 | isbn=9004113428 | editor-last=Orton | editor-first=David E. | chapter=Matthean Posteriority: a Preliminary Proposal | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jFVh51jLIrYC&amp;pg=PA204 | last=Huggins | first=Ronald V. | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; then Hengel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Four Gospels and the One Gospel of Jesus Christ | authorlink=Martin Hengel | year=2000 | pages=169–207 | isbn=1563383004 | last=Hengel | first=Martin | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; then independently by Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Synoptic Gospels Compared | year=2003 | isbn=0773468145 | series=Studies in the Bible and Early Christianity | volume=55 | last=Blair | first=George Alfred | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional recent supporters include Garrow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Gospel of Matthew's Dependence on the Didache | year=2004 | pages=225–237 | isbn=0826469779 | last=Garrow | first=Alan | ref=harv | series=Journal for the study of the New Testament: Supplement series | volume=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Powell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Myth of the Lost Gospel | year=2006 | isbn=0977048608 | last=Powell | first=Evan | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==

Most arguments for the Wilke hypothesis follow those of the [[Farrer hypothesis]] in accepting [[Marcan priority]] but rejecting [[Q source|Q]]. The difference, then, is in the direction of dependence between Matthew and Luke.

Arguments advanced in favor of Matthaean posteriority include:

* Matthew's version of the [[Synoptic Gospels#The double tradition|double tradition]] appears more developed in wording and structure than Luke's, which appears more primitive. (The same observation is made by supporters of the [[two-source hypothesis]], who regard Luke adhering better to the original Q.)
* Matthew contains passages that are conflations of elements drawn from Mark and Luke (e.g. Matt 9:14-17, 9:35-10,12:22-30, 12:31-32, 19:23-30, 24:23-28). This phenomenon is unique to Matthew, for there is no similar array of passages in Luke that are composed of elements drawn from Mark and Matthew.
* Matthew seems to have deliberately rearranged his sources to collecting teachings into five large blocks (e.g., the [[Sermon on the Mount]]), which makes better sense than Luke rearranging Matthew into scattered fragments.
* In the double tradition, Matthew's language often retains characteristically Lucan features.
* The frequent occurrence of doublets in Matthew may indicate drawing from similar accounts in two different sources.
