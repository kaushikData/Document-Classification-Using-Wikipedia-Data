}}The '''Alexians''', '''Alexian Brothers''' or '''Cellites''' are a Catholic [[religious institute]] or [[congregation (Catholic)|congregation]] specifically devoted to caring for the sick which has its origin in Europe at the time of the [[Black Death]]. They follow the [[Augustinian]] rule. 

==History==
The Alexians trace their origin to the early 12th-century [[Beguines and Beghards|Beghards]], male counterparts of the [[Beguines and Beghards|Beguines]], [[layperson|laywomen]] who followed a devout style of life in a limited degree of common life. The men did not get much attention until they made a great contribution in history in the city of [[Mechelen]], in the [[Duchy of Brabant]] (in central [[Flanders]], now [[Belgium]]), some time in the 14th century, during the terrible ravages of the [[Black Death]]. Some laymen united under the guidance of a man named Tobias to succor the plague-stricken without taking any vows or adopting [[monasticism]]. One of their most obvious activities was caring for those stricken with the [[bubonic plague]], along with their families, and burying those who died. These laymen lived in little rooms or cells (from Latin "cella," a cell that gave rise to their early name of "Cellites").

The speculation that the name "Beghards" arose from supporting themselves by begging for food was dismissed by the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]].

The plague victims became the outcasts of the society and were thrown outside the city walls, along with the other marginalized folk, to die. Moved by compassion, these laymen came together and vowed to take care of these victims who were abandoned by not only the state and the church, but also their families. Later on, the group attracted more men who chose to abandon their secular lives to live in community as brothers and to serve the needs of the poor. Eventually, the Catholic Church saw the utility of the brothers and invited them to be formally recognized as a religious group and subsequently gave them pontifical status. The brothers were associated with a chapel dedicated to [[Alexius of Rome]], who had served many years in a hospital at [[Edessa]] in [[Syria]], and they began to be called the Brothers at St. Alexius Chapel, a name that evolved into that of Alexian Brothers, their modern name.

=== Germany ===
The Brothers rapidly spread throughout [[Germany]], Brabant, Flanders, and other countries. They were also styled in [[Middle Dutch]] ''lollebroeders'' "mumbling brothers", or ''"Lollhorden"'', from Old {{lang-de|lollon}}, meaning "to sing softly," from their chants for the dead. This name was later adopted as a term of contempt, applied first to [[Franciscans]] and later to the heretical  followers of [[John Wycliffe]].) The Alexians did not escape calumny and persecution, as demonstrated from the [[papal bull]] ''"Ad Audientiam Nostram"'' (2 December 1377) which [[Pope Gregory XI]] sent to the German bishops, especially those of [[Cologne]], [[Trier]] and [[Mainz]], forbidding annoyance of the "Cellites" and enjoining punishment for their persecutors. This was followed by Bulls of a similar tenor from [[Pope Boniface IX]] on 7 January 1396, [[Pope Eugene IV]] on 12 May 1431, [[Pope Nicholas V]] and [[Pope Pius II]].

In 1469, the [[motherhouse]] at [[Aachen]] voiced the general feeling of the Brothers in asking [[Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Liège]], to raise that house to a [[convent]] of the [[Order of Saint Augustine]]. The request was granted, and in 1854 Father Dominicus Brock and five of the Brothers took the solemn vows of religious under the rule of St. Augustine. This step and the revised constitution of the [[Religious institute (Catholic)|religious institute]] were confirmed by [[Pope Pius IX]] on 12 September 1870.

=== Hospitals ===
In the early 20th century the Alexian Brothers had four hospitals in the United States. The first was built in [[Chicago]] in 1866; it was destroyed by the [[1871 Great Chicago Fire|Great Fire]], on 9 October 1871, and rebuilt the following year. The second, erected at [[St. Louis]] in 1869, covered an acre with its departments for the insane, nervous diseases, and inebriates. The third was in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]] and built in 1880. The fourth was built in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], on land given for that purpose by Right Rev. Bishop Wigger. Competent surgeons and physicians attended to the patients, and the Brothers nursed and did the housework of the hospitals.

Today, the Chicago hospital has become the Alexian Brothers Medical Center and Rehabilitation Hospital in [[Elk Grove Village, Illinois]], and the St. Alexius Medical Center and Behavioral Hospital, both in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. These also operate satellite centers and clinics around Illinois. In Missouri, Tennessee and Wisconsin the Alexians run a group of facilities, care systems, homes and communities all for older adults. The other hospitals have been sold or closed.

Bishop (later Cardinal) [[Herbert Vaughan]] of the [[City of Salford]], [[England]] invited the Alexians to take charge of a new home and hospital in his diocese, which led to their establishing themselves in England in June 1875. Dr Richard Lacy, [[Bishop of Middlesbrough]], secured them for his diocese in 1884. In 1885, the Brothers established a province of their institute and a novitiate in the [[United Kingdom]]. The latter, first attached to St. Mary's Convent, [[Newton Heath]], [[Manchester]], was later transferred to [[West Twyford]], near [[Ealing]], which the Alexian Brothers had purchased.

==Present situation==
The Immaculate Conception Province (the American Province) sponsors [https://web.archive.org/web/20110212005104/http://www.alexianbrothershealth.org/index.aspx Alexian Brothers Health System], which provides services in acute care, residential elderly care, retirement centers, and AIDS ministry in [[Illinois]], [[Missouri]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Tennessee]], and also outside the USA in the [[Philippines]] and [[Hungary]]. On January 1, 2012 the Alexian Brothers Health System became part of  St. Louis-based [[Ascension Health]], the nation’s largest Catholic and non-profit health system.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The contemporary British houses in [[London]] and [[Manchester]], as well as the Irish ones in [[Dublin]] and [[Limerick]], include facilities for the elderly sick and physically handicapped through a nursing home and Day Centre; an AIDS ministry; care and rehabilitation of homeless men; and support for people suffering from mental illness.

On the European continent the contemporary German branch has houses in [[Aachen]], [[Krefeld]], [[Kraiburg|Malseneck]], [[Münster]] and [[Twistringen]]. In Belgium they have centres in [[Boechout]], [[Tienen]], [[Grimbergen]] and [[Henri-Chapelle]], where they provide psychiatric services.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome''', also called '''antidepressant withdrawal syndrome''', is a condition that can occur following the interruption, reduction, or [[Medication discontinuation|discontinuation]] of [[antidepressant medication]].&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt; The symptoms may include [[flu-like symptoms]], trouble sleeping, nausea, poor balance, sensory changes, and [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gab2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dav2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davies |first1=J |last2=Read |first2=J |title=A systematic review into the incidence, severity and duration of antidepressant withdrawal effects: Are guidelines evidence-based? |journal=Addictive behaviors |date=4 September 2018 |doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.08.027 |pmid=30292574}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem usually begins within three days and may last for several months.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dav2018/&gt; Rarely [[psychosis]] may occur.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt;

&lt;!-- Risk factors and diagnosis --&gt;
A discontinuation syndrome can occur after stopping any antidepressant including [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRIs), [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs) and [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs).&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gab2017/&gt; The risk is greater among those who have taken the medication for longer and when the medication in question has a short [[half-life]].&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt; The underlying reason for its occurrence is unclear.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt; The diagnosis is based on the symptoms.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Methods of prevention include gradually decreasing the dose among those who wish to stop, though it is possible for symptoms to occur with tapering.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wil2015&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=E |last2=Lader |first2=M |title=A review of the management of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms |journal=Therapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology |date=December 2015 |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=357–68 |doi=10.1177/2045125315612334 |pmid=26834969|pmc=4722507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dav2018 /&gt; Treatment may include restarting the medication and slowly decreasing the dose.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt; People may also be switched to the long acting antidepressant [[fluoxetine]] which can then be gradually decreased.&lt;ref name=Wil2015/&gt; 

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and prognosis --&gt;
Approximately 20-50% of people who suddenly stop an antidepressant develop an antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.&lt;ref name=War2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Warner |first1=CH |last2=Bobo |first2=W |last3=Warner |first3=C |last4=Reid |first4=S |last5=Rachal |first5=J |title=Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome |journal=American Family Physician |date=1 August 2006 |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=449–56 |pmid=16913164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gab2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gabriel |first1=M |last2=Sharma |first2=V |title=Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |date=29 May 2017 |volume=189 |issue=21 |pages=E747 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.160991 |pmid=28554948|pmc=5449237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dav2018 /&gt; The condition is generally not serious.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt; Though about half of people with symptoms describe them as severe.&lt;ref name=Dav2018/&gt; Some restart antidepressants due to the severity of the symptoms.&lt;ref name=Dav2018/&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
People with antidepressant discontinuation syndrome have been on an [[antidepressant]] for at least four weeks and have recently stopped taking the medication, whether abruptly, after a fast taper, or each time the medication is reduced on a slow taper.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt; Commonly reported symptoms include flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, sweating) and sleep disturbances (insomnia, nightmares, constant sleepiness). Sensory and movement disturbances have also been reported, including [[Balance (ability)|imbalance]], [[tremor]]s, [[vertigo]], dizziness, and electric-shock-like experiences in the brain, often described by people who have them as "brain zaps". Mood disturbances such as [[dysphoria]], anxiety, or agitation are also reported, as are cognitive disturbances such as confusion and [[Fight-or-flight response|hyperarousal]].

In cases associated with sudden discontinuation of [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO inhibitors]], acute [[psychosis]] has been observed.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haddad2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haddad |first=Peter M. |last2=Anderson |first2=Ian M. |date=October 2007 |title=Recognising and managing antidepressant discontinuation symptoms |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=447–57 |doi=10.1192/apt.bp.105.001966 |doi-access=free |url=http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/13/6/447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Renoir2013&gt;{{cite journal | author = Renoir T | year = 2013 | title = Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant treatment discontinuation syndrome: a review of the clinical evidence and the possible mechanisms involved | url = | journal = Front Pharmacol | volume = 4 | issue = | page = 45 | doi = 10.3389/fphar.2013.00045 | pmid = 23596418 | pmc=3627130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over fifty symptoms have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haddad PM, Dursun SM | year = 2008 | title = Neurological complications of psychiatric drugs: clinical features and management | url = | journal = Hum Psychopharmacol | volume = 23 | issue = Suppl 1| pages = 15–26 | doi = 10.1002/hup.918 |doi-access=free | pmid = 18098217 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most cases of discontinuation syndrome may last between one and four weeks, are relatively mild, and resolve on their own; in more severe cases, symptoms can be severe or extended.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt; [[Paroxetine]] and [[venlafaxine]] seem to be particularly difficult to discontinue, and [[Post-acute-withdrawal syndrome|prolonged withdrawal syndrome]] (post-acute-withdrawal syndrome, or PAWS) lasting over 18 months has been reported with paroxetine.&lt;ref name="DrugSaf2001-Haddad" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tamam |first=L. |last2=Ozpoyraz |first2=N. |title=Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Discontinuation Syndrome: A Review |journal=Advances in Therapy |date=January–February 2002 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=17–26 |doi=10.1007/BF02850015 |pmid=12008858}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2ndGenReview"&gt;{{cite report |last1=Gartlehner |first1=Gerald |last2=Hansen |first2=Richard A. |last3=Morgan |first3=Laura C. |last4=Thaler |first4=Kylie |last5=Lux |first5=Linda J. |last6=Noord |first6=Megan Van |last7=Mager |first7=Ursula |last8=Gaynes |first8=Bradley N. |last9=Thieda |first9=Patricia |last10=Strobelberger |first10=Michaela |last11=Lloyd |first11=Stacey |last12=Reichenpfader |first12=Ursula |last13=Lohr |first13=Kathleen N. |name-list-format=vanc |display-authors=3 |chapter=Results |chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83447/ |title=Second-Generation Antidepressants in the Pharmacologic Treatment of Adult Depression: An Update of the 2007 Comparative Effectiveness Review |series=Comparative Effectiveness Reviews |number=46 |location=Rockville, MD |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 Advisory Committee to the FDA found that online anecdotal reports of discontinuation syndrome related to [[duloxetine]] (''Cymbalta'') included severe symptoms and exceeded prevalence of both paroxetine (''Paxil'') and venlafaxine (''Effexor'') reports by over 250% (although acknowledged this may have been influenced by duloxetine (''Cymbalta'') being a much newer drug).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/PsychopharmacologicDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM172866.pdf|title=Cymbalta (Duloxetine) Discontinuation Syndrome: Issues of Scope, Severity, Duration &amp; Management|last=|first=|date=9 June 2009|website=|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)|access-date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also found that the safety information provided by the manufacturer not only neglected important information about managing discontinuation syndrome, but also explicitly advised against opening capsules, a practice required to gradually taper dosage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Duration===
Symptoms usually resolve within two weeks but occasionally last up to one year.&lt;ref name=Gab2017/&gt;

They typically resolve within a day of restoring the medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Peter M.|last1=Haddad|first2=Ian M.|last2=Anderson|title=Recognising and managing antidepressant discontinuation symptoms|url=http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/13/6/447|journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment|date=1 November 2007|issn=2056-4678|pages=447–457|volume=13|issue=6|doi=10.1192/apt.bp.105.001966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==

The underlying reason for its occurrence is unclear,&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt; though the syndrome appears similar to withdrawal from other psychotropic drugs such as [[Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|benzodiazepines]].&lt;ref name=TI2018/&gt;

== Prevention and treatment ==

In some cases, discontinuation syndrome (withdrawal) may be prevented by taking medication as directed, and when discontinuing, doing so gradually, although symptoms may appear while tapering. When discontinuing an antidepressant with a short [[Biological half-life|half-life]], switching to a drug with a longer half-life (e.g. [[fluoxetine]] (''Prozac'') or [[citalopram]]) and then tapering, and eventually discontinuing, from that drug can decrease the severity of symptoms.&lt;ref name=Haddad2007/&gt;

Treatment is dependent on the severity of the discontinuation reaction and whether or not further antidepressant treatment is warranted. In cases where further antidepressant treatment is prescribed, then the only option suggested may be restarting the antidepressant. If antidepressants are no longer required, treatment depends on symptom severity. If symptoms of discontinuation are severe, or do not respond to symptom management, the antidepressant can be reinstated and then withdrawn more cautiously, or by switching to a drug with a longer half life, (such as ''Prozac''), and then tapering and discontinuing that drug.&lt;ref name="DrugSaf2001-Haddad"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haddad |first=Peter M. |title=Antidepressant discontinuation syndromes |journal=Drug Safety |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=183–97 |date=March 2001 |pmid=11347722 |doi=10.2165/00002018-200124030-00003 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In severe cases, hospitalization may be required.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt;

=== Pregnancy and newborns ===
Antidepressants, including SSRIs, can cross the [[placenta]] and have the potential to affect the fetus and newborn, including an increased chance of [[miscarriage]], presenting a dilemma for pregnant women to decide whether to continue to take antidepressants at all, or if they do, considering if tapering and discontinuing during pregnancy could have a protective effect for the newborn.&lt;ref name=Byatt&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Byatt N, Deligiannidis KM, Freeman MP | date = Feb 2013 | title = Antidepressant use in pregnancy: a critical review focused on risks and controversies | journal = [[Acta Psychiatr Scand]] | volume = 127 | issue = 2| pages = 94–114 | doi = 10.1111/acps.12042 | pmid = 23240634 | pmc=4006272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postnatal adaptation syndrome (PNAS) (originally called "neonatal behavioral syndrome", "poor neonatal adaptation syndrome", or "neonatal withdrawal syndrome") was first noticed in 1973 in newborns of mothers taking antidepressants; symptoms in the infant include [[irritability]], rapid breathing, [[hypothermia]], and [[blood sugar]] problems.

Antidepressant discontinuation symptoms were first reported with [[imipramine]], the first [[tricyclic antidepressant]] (TCA), in the late 1950s, and each new class of antidepressants has brought reports of similar conditions, including [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs), SSRIs, and SNRIs.  As of 2001, at least 21 different antidepressants, covering all the major classes, were known to cause discontinuation syndromes.&lt;ref name="DrugSaf2001-Haddad" /&gt; The problem has been poorly studied, and most of the literature has been case reports or small [[Clinical trial|clinical studies]]; incidence is hard to determine and controversial.&lt;ref name="DrugSaf2001-Haddad" /&gt;

With the explosion of use and interest in SSRIs in the late 1980s and early 1990s, focused especially on [[Prozac#Popular culture|Prozac]], interest grew as well in discontinuation syndromes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/magazine/06antidepressant-t.html|work=New York Times |title=Self-Nonmedication |first=Bruce |last=Stutz |date=2007-05-06 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the symptoms emerged from discussion boards where people with depression discussed their experiences with the disease and their medications; "brain zaps" or "brain shivers" was one symptom that emerged via these websites.&lt;ref name="Christmas"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Christmas, M.B. |title='Brain shivers': from chat room to clinic |journal=Psychiatric Bulletin |year=2005 |volume=29 |pages=219–21 |url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/content/29/6/219 |doi=10.1192/pb.29.6.219 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aronson"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Aronson, J. |title=Bottled lightning |journal=BMJ |date=8 October 2005 |volume=331 |page=824 |doi=10.1136/bmj.331.7520.824 |issue=7520 |pmc=1246084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heightened media attention and continuing public concerns led to the formation of an expert group on the safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in [[England]], to evaluate all the research available prior to 2004.&lt;ref name="CSMExpert"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/pl-p/documents/drugsafetymessage/con019472.pdf | title=Report of the CSM Expert Working Group on the Safety of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Antidepressants | publisher=Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency | date=December 2004 | accessdate=1 August 2014 | author=Expert Group on the Safety of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) |editor-first=Ian V.D. |editor-last=Weller }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|iv}}  The group determined that the incidence of discontinuation symptoms are between 5% and 49%, depending on the particular SSRI, the length of time on the medicine and abrupt versus gradual cessation.&lt;ref name="CSMExpert"/&gt;{{rp|126–136}}

With the lack of a definition based on consensus criteria for the syndrome, a panel met in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in 1997 to form a draft definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schatzberg, A.F. |author2=Haddad, P. |author3=Kaplan, E.M. |author4=Lejoyeux, M. |author5=Rosenbaum, J.F. |author6=Young, A.H. |author7=Zajecka, J. |title=Serotonin reuptake inhibitor discontinuation syndrome: a hypothetical definition.

In the late 1990s, some investigators thought that the fact that symptoms emerged when antidepressants were discontinued might mean that antidepressants were causing [[addiction]], and some used the term "withdrawal syndrome" to describe the symptoms. While people taking antidepressants do not commonly exhibit drug seeking behavior, stopping antidepressants leads to  similar symptoms as found in [[drug withdrawal]] from [[benzodiazapines]], and other psychotropic drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Nielsen, M. |author2=Hanse, E.H. |author3=Gøtzsche, P.C.|title=What is the difference between dependence and withdrawal reactions? A comparison of benzodiazepines and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors|journal=Addiction |volume=105 |issue=5 |pages=900–8 |year=2012 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03686.x |pmid=21992148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Fava, G.A. |author2=Gatti, A |author3=Belaise, C. et al|title=Withdrawal Symptoms after Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Discontinuation: A Systematic Review |journal= Psychother Psychosom |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=72–81 |year=2015 |doi=10.1159/000370338 |pmid=25721705 }} &lt;/ref&gt; As such, some researchers advocate the term withdrawal over discontinuation, to communicate the similar [[physiological dependence]] and negative outcomes.&lt;ref name="TI2018" /&gt; Due to pressure from pharmaceutical companies who make anti-depressants, the term "withdrawal syndrome" is no longer used by drug makers, and thus, most doctors, due to concerns that they may be compared to other drugs more commonly associated with withdrawal.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt;

=== 2013 class action lawsuit ===

In 2013, a proposed class action lawsuit, ''Jennifer L Saavedra v. Eli Lilly and Company'',&lt;ref&gt;Justia. [http://dockets.justia.com/docket/california/cacdce/2:2012cv09366/546821 Jennifer L Saavedra v. Eli Lilly and Company]&lt;/ref&gt; was brought against [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] claiming that the [[Cymbalta]] label omitted important information about "brain zaps" and other symptoms upon cessation.&lt;ref name="Law360"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law360.com/articles/411089/lilly-fights-cymbalta-brain-zaps-suit-saying-it-warned-docs | title=Lilly Fights Cymbalta 'Brain Zaps' Suit, Saying It Warned Docs | publisher=Law360 | date=January 29, 2013 | accessdate=3 August 2014 | author=Overley, Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eli Lilly moved for dismissal per the "[[learned intermediary]] doctrine" as the doctors prescribing the drug were warned of the potential problems and are an intermediary medical judgment between Lilly and patients; in December 2013 Lilly's motion to dismiss was denied.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rebecca Tushnet]] for Rebecca Tushnet's 43(B)log December 09, 2013 [http://tushnet.blogspot.com/2013/12/learned-intermediary-doctrine-doesnt.html Learned intermediary doctrine doesn't bar claim at pleading stage]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
The mechanisms of antidepressant withdrawal syndrome have not yet been conclusively identified.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Renoir2013/&gt;  The leading hypothesis is that after the antidepressant is discontinued, there is a temporary, but in some cases, long-lasting, deficiency in the brain of one or more essential [[neurotransmitters]] that regulate mood, such as [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|gamma-aminobutyric acid]], and since neurotransmitters are an interrelated system, dysregulation of one affects the others.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.4088/JCP.v65n0806 |author=Damsa, C. |title="Dopamine-dependent" side effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: a clinical review |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=8 |pages=1064–8 |date=August 2004 |pmid=15323590 |url=http://article.psychiatrist.com/?ContentType=START&amp;ID=10001001 |author2=Bumb, A. |author3=Bianchi-Demicheli, F. |display-authors=3 |last4=Vidailhet |first4=Pierre |last5=Sterck |first5=Robert |last6=Andreoli |first6=Antonio |last7=Beyenburg |first7=Stefan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:AtosOrganigramme.png|thumb|right|400px|A diagram of the history of Atos acquisitions]]
The company was formed in 1997 through a merger of two French IT companies; and combined with the Dutch-based company Origin B.V. in 2000 to become Atos Origin.&lt;ref name="RD2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atos.net/NR/rdonlyres/EBB49934-3EE4-4255-898B-720EEBB4D232/0/atos_annual_report_2011.pdf |title=Annual report 2011 |accessdate=23 February 2012 |publisher=Atos SE |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently acquired [[KPMG]] Consulting in 2002 and [[SchlumbergerSema]] in 2004.

In 2010 Atos Origin announced the buyout of [[Siemens IT Solutions and Services]] and finalized the acquisition in July 2011. Afterwards, the company name reverted to Atos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Atos acquires Siemens IT Solutions and Services|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-07-01/news/29726117_1_atos-origin-siemens-ag-share-capital|accessdate=5 August 2012|newspaper=The Economic Times|date=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cw-siemens&gt;{{cite news|title=Atos Origin acquires Siemens division for €850m|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/1280094628/Atos-Origin-acquires-Siemens-division-for-850m|accessdate=27 May 2013|newspaper=Computer Weekly|date=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Atos partnered with Google Cloud to help offer secure artificial intelligence solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-atos-google-cloud/atos-partners-with-google-cloud-as-new-eu-data-law-looms-idUSKBN1HV2MV|title=Atos partners with Google Cloud as new EU data law looms|last=Jacob|first=Manon|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cxotoday.com/story/atos-google-partner-to-boost-enterprise-collaboration/|title=Atos, Google Partner To Boost Enterprise Collaboration - CXOtoday.com|website=www.cxotoday.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AtosOrigin.svg|thumb|right|Logo of Atos Origin used prior to July 2011]]

=== Background: a series of mergers (1997–2011) ===
In 1996, Origin B.V. was created after a merger of the Dutch company BSO and the Philips C&amp;P (Communications &amp; Processing) division, while a year later in 1997, Atos was created following a merger of the French companies Axime and Sligos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Axime, Sligos merger named Atos Origin|url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/axime-sligos-merger-named-atos|publisher=Telecompaper|date=29 May 1997|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Atos Origin sold its Nordic operations to WM-data. In 2002, it made a major acquisition by buying [[KPMG Consulting]] in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands. Then in 2004, it acquired [[Sema Group|SchlumbergerSema]], the IT service division of [[Schlumberger]] and took over the infrastructure division of ITELLIUM, a subsidiary of [[KarstadtQuelle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atos Origin acquires German IT unit under outsourcing deal|url=http://www.consultant-news.com/article_display.aspx?p=adp&amp;id=1738|website=ConsultantNews.com|accessdate=8 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time (2004), the company created a new subsidiary, Atos Worldline, and the renaming of its consulting activities as Atos Consulting. Also in 2004, Atos Origin Australia, originating from [[Philips]], was sold to Fujitsu. In 2005,  Atos Origin sold its activities in the Nordic region, which had become part of the company with the acquisition of Sema Group, to [[WM-data]] while in 2006, Atos Origin sold its operations in the Middle East to local management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Atos Origin sells Nordic IT services ops to WM-data for 145 mln eur cash |url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2005/05/23/afx2046385.html |accessdate=2 September 2010 |newspaper=[[Forbes]] |date=23 May 2005 |agency=[[AFX News]] }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Philippe Germond replaced longtime CEO Bernard Bourigeaud. Two shareholders, the [[hedge fund]]s Centaurus Capital and Pardus Capital, tried to gain control over the company via the supervisory board.&lt;ref name="BL"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chassany|first=Anne-Sylvaine|title=Atos Origin Board Fires Chief Germond, Hires Breton|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aOpHCL50TOTA|accessdate=2 September 2010|date=17 November 2008|agency=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, the boardroom battle came to an end when [[Thierry Breton]] replaced Philippe Germond as chairman and CEO.&lt;ref name=BL /&gt;

In August 2010 Atos Origin acquired Indian payment company Venture Infotek.

=== Doubling size with acquisition of Siemens IT (2011) ===
In December 2010 Atos Origin agreed to acquire the IT Solutions and Services subsidiary of [[Siemens]] for €850 million.&lt;ref name="DJN"&gt;{{cite news|title=Atos Origin To Buy Siemens AG's IT Unit In EUR850M Deal|url=http://www.advfn.com/news_UPDATE-Atos-Origin-To-Buy-Siemens-AGs-IT-Unit-In-EUR850-Million-Deal_45655050.html|accessdate=2 July 2011|date=14 December 2010|agency=[[Dow Jones Newswires]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the transaction, Siemens agreed to take a 15% stake in the enlarged Atos, to be held for a minimum of five years.&lt;ref name="DJN" /&gt;

The company dropped the "Origin" suffix of its name in July 2011 after completing its acquisition of the Siemens unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Atos Origin changes name amid acquisition|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/atos-origin-changes-name-amid-acquisition-2011-07-01|accessdate=2 July 2011|date=1 July 2011|agency=[[MarketWatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Atos Headquarters.JPG|left|thumb|Atos headquarters in Bezons (France)]]
In November 2011 Atos and software services provider Ufida International Holdings formed the joint venture Yunano. The two companies invested €5.7 million.

== Controversy ==

=== Atos Healthcare ===
{{Main article|Work Capability Assessment}}In the United Kingdom, from 1998 - 2015 Atos Healthcare was at the centre of a controversy over the management of [[Atos Healthcare|contracts by their healthcare division]] of the [[Work Capability Assessment]] for the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] (DWP).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; In August 2015, statistics from the Department of Work and Pensions revealed that 2,380 people had died between 2011 - 2014 soon after being found fit for work through disability benefit assessments.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/27/thousands-died-after-fit-for-work-assessment-dwp-figures|title=Thousands have died after being found fit for work, DWP figures show|first=Patrick Butler Social policy|last=editor|date=27 August 2015|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, "the DWP negotiated an early exit from the existing WCA contract with the private firm, Atos, after raising concerns about the quality of its work".&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26287199|title=Atos seeks early exit from fit-to-work tests contract|date=21 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/23/disability-fitness-tests-flawed|title=Disabled people's 'fit for work' assessments should be scrapped – MPs|first=Patrick|last=Butler|date=22 July 2014|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Atos still (as of October 2016) undertakes work for the DWP in assessing [[Personal Independence Payment]] applications.[https://web.archive.org/web/20161005193723/http://www.atoshealthcare.com/pip/]  The Press Association revealed in 2017 that Atos, used by the DWP to make its decisions, are set to be paid more than £700m for their five-year contracts against an original estimate of £512m.&lt;ref&gt;[The Independent]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Atos took over administering PIP's estimates of how fast claims could be processed were over-optimistic as were estimates of how easily claimants could get to assessment centres.  This led to delays in assessments, distress to claimants and unexpectedly high costs.  Atos was accused of misleading the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/20/atos-accused-misleading-government-process-claims-sick-disabled Atos accused of misleading government over how quickly it could process claims] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Atos developed a computer system that would extract data from GP's computers Nationwide.  Costs rose from £14 million to £40 million and it was felt Atos had taken insufficient care how it spent taxpayers' money.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/07/government_reviews_atos_contracts/ UK.gov will scrutinise all its Atos contracts following IT cock-up]&lt;/ref&gt;

Atos lost the contract for fitness to work tests, Richard Hawkes of [[Scope (charity)|Scope]] said, "I doubt there's a single disabled person who'll be sorry to hear that Atos will no longer be running the fit-for-work tests." Hawkes claimed the  "fundamentally flawed" test should be "more than an exercise in getting people off benefits.  It should make sure disabled people get the specialist, tailored and flexible support they need to find and keep a job."

[[Mark Serwotka]] of [[Public and Commercial Services Union]] described the assessments as "designed to harass vulnerable people and take their benefits away rather than provide support and guidance.  Doctors, MPs and disabled people all believe the tests should be scrapped so, instead of replacing the failed Atos with another profit-hungry provider, the government should bring the work in-house and invest in it properly."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26766345 Fit-to-work tests: Atos contract to end] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] leader, [[Tim Farron]] questioned how Atos and [[Capita]] could have been paid over £500m from tax payers money for assessing fitness to work as 61% who appealed won their appeals.  Farron stated, “This adds to the suspicion that these companies are just driven by a profit motive, and the incentive is to get the assessments done, but not necessarily to get the assessments right. They are the ugly face of business.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/27/private-firms-500m-governments-fit-to-work-scheme Private firms earn £500m from government's fit-to-work scheme] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Atos Healthcare rebranded its occupational health business to become OH Assist. The Atos Healthcare brand was reserved for use for the PIP contract. Atos sold its OH Assist business to CBPE Capital in 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latentexistence.me.uk/the-atos-name-is-toxic-atos-spins-off-oh-assist/|title=The Atos name is toxic - Atos spins off OH Assist|last=|first=|date=25 February 2014|website=|publisher=|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporation tax ===
It was disclosed in November 2013 through the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] that Atos had paid no corporation tax at all in the UK in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Christopher Hope|title=Atos, G4S paid no corporation tax last year despite carrying out £2billion of taxpayer-funded work|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10442231/Atos-G4S-paid-no-corporation-tax-last-year-despite-carrying-out-2billion-of-taxpayer-funded-work.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=12 November 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total value of contracts that had been awarded to Atos by June 2013 was approximately £1.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost of Atos and Capita|url=http://www.disabilityrightsuk.org/news/2013/june/cost-atos-and-capita|publisher=Disability Rights UK|date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, some UK-based disability campaign groups called for a boycott of the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] due to Atos' sponsorship of the games and Atos Healthcare's UK contract to perform Work Capability Assessments on behalf of the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Razzall|first=Katie|title=Campaigners threaten Paralympics boycott|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/campaigners-threaten-paralympics-boycott|accessdate=27 October 2011|date=30 September 2011|work=[[Channel 4 News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first week of the [[Paralympics]] in the summer of 2012, activists and disabled people targeted Atos in a series of nationwide protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=James|title=Disabled People Against Cuts stage demo against Paralympics sponsor|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/cardiffonline/cardiff-news/2012/08/30/disabled-people-against-cuts-stage-demo-against-paralympics-sponsor-91466-31727698/|accessdate=4 September 2012|newspaper=Wales Online|date=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated on Friday 31 August with a demonstration outside Atos headquarters in London,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/31/atos-protest-paralympics-sponsor "Atos protesters clash with police in 'day of action' against Paralympics sponsor"] 31 August 2012.

===Pharmacodynamics===

Several components of the [[signaling cascade]] that mediates the HMB-induced increase in human skeletal muscle protein synthesis have been identified ''[[in vivo]]''.&lt;ref name="Pimentel 2017 systematic review on HMB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pharmacology of HMB-FA in humans in vivo"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkinson DJ, Hossain T, Hill DS, Phillips BE, Crossland H, Williams J, Loughna P, Churchward-Venne TA, Breen L, Phillips SM, Etheridge T, Rathmacher JA, Smith K, Szewczyk NJ, Atherton PJ | title = Effects of leucine and its metabolite β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate on human skeletal muscle protein metabolism | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 591 | issue = 11 | pages = 2911–2923 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23551944 | pmc = 3690694 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2013.253203 | quote = The stimulation of MPS through mTORc1-signalling following HMB exposure is in agreement with pre-clinical studies (Eley et al. 2008).&amp;nbsp;... Furthermore, there was clear divergence in the amplitude of phosphorylation for 4EBP1 (at Thr37/46 and Ser65/Thr70) and p70S6K (Thr389) in response to both Leu and HMB, with the latter showing more pronounced and sustained phosphorylation.&amp;nbsp;...  Nonetheless, as the overall MPS response was similar, this cellular signalling distinction did not translate into statistically distinguishable anabolic effects in our primary outcome measure of MPS.&amp;nbsp;... Interestingly, although orally supplied HMB produced no increase in plasma insulin, it caused a depression in MPB (−57%). Normally, postprandial decreases in MPB (of ~50%) are attributed to the nitrogen-sparing effects of insulin since clamping insulin at post-absorptive concentrations (5&amp;nbsp;μU&amp;nbsp;ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) while continuously infusing AAs (18&amp;nbsp;g&amp;nbsp;h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) did not suppress MPB (Greenhaff et al. 2008), which is why we chose not to measure MPB in the Leu group, due to an anticipated hyperinsulinaemia (Fig. 3C). Thus, HMB reduces MPB in a fashion similar to, but independent of, insulin. These findings are in-line with reports of the anti-catabolic effects of HMB suppressing MPB in pre-clinical models, via attenuating proteasomal-mediated proteolysis in response to LPS (Eley et al. 2008).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to HMB's [[Precursor (chemistry)|metabolic precursor]], {{nowrap|{{smallcaps all|L}}-leucine}}, HMB has been shown to increase protein synthesis in human skeletal muscle via [[phosphorylation]] of the [[mechanistic target of rapamycin]] (mTOR) and subsequent activation of {{abbrlink|mTORC1|mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1}}, which leads to [[Translation (biology)|protein biosynthesis]] in cellular [[ribosome]]s via phosphorylation of mTORC1's immediate targets (i.e., the [[p70S6 kinase]] and the [[protein translation|translation]] repressor protein [[4EBP1]]).{{#tag:ref|Approximately equal doses of pure {{abbr|HMB-FA|β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid}} (2.42&amp;nbsp;grams) and {{nowrap|{{smallcaps all|L}}-leucine}} (3.42&amp;nbsp;grams) do not produce statistically distinguishable anabolic effects, as measured by the [[fractional synthesis]] of [[myofibril|myofibrillar proteins]], in the skeletal muscle of living humans.&lt;ref name="Pharmacology of HMB-FA in humans in vivo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarcopenia July 2015 review" /&gt; At 150&amp;nbsp;minutes post-ingestion, these doses of HMB-FA and {{nowrap|{{smallcaps all|L}}-leucine}} increased muscle protein synthesis by ~70% and ~110% respectively in one study.&lt;ref name="Pharmacology of HMB-FA in humans in vivo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarcopenia July 2015 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips SM | title = Nutritional supplements in support of resistance exercise to counter age-related sarcopenia | journal = Advances in Nutrition | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 452–460 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26178029 | pmc = 4496741 | doi = 10.3945/an.115.008367 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}&lt;ref name="Pharmacology of HMB-FA in humans in vivo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skeletal muscle homeostasis 2016 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brook MS, Wilkinson DJ, Phillips BE, Perez-Schindler J, Philp A, Smith K, Atherton PJ | title = Skeletal muscle homeostasis and plasticity in youth and ageing: impact of nutrition and exercise | journal = Acta Physiologica | volume = 216 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–41 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26010896 | pmc = 4843955 | doi = 10.1111/apha.12532 | quote = The mechanisms underlying the anabolic effects of food intake involve both the stimulation of MPS (Rennie et al. 1982) and suppression of MPB (Wilkes et al. 2009). The potent increase in MPS is driven almost entirely by essential amino acids (EAAs) (Smith et al. 1992), with the branched chain AA (BCAA: leucine, isoleucine and valine), in particular leucine [and its metabolite(s), e.g. β‐hydroxy β‐methylbutyric acid (HMB) (Van Koevering &amp; Nissen 1992)] being central to these effects (Wilkinson et al. 2013). Although the mechanisms underlying the unique anabolic properties of leucine are incompletely defined, recent work in yeast and cultured mammalians cells has demonstrated that leucyl tRNA synthetase is upstream of activating the hitherto ‘cellular AA sensor’, the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in response to leucine (Bonfils et al. 2012, Han et al. 2012). This was reaffirmed by experiments showing that of all the EAAs, leucine is the most effective EAA in increasing the activity (i.e. phosphorylation) of mTORC1 (Atherton et al. 2010b) and its substrates. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Muscle atrophy-related signal transduction review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dutt V, Gupta S, Dabur R, Injeti E, Mittal A | title = Skeletal muscle atrophy: Potential therapeutic agents and their mechanisms of action | journal = Pharmacological Research | volume = 99 | issue =  | pages = 86–100 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26048279 | doi = 10.1016/j.phrs.2015.05.010 | quote = In an experimental animal model of cancer-induced cachexia, HMB treatment not only down-regulated the expression of key regulatory components of 19S and 20S proteasome–proteolytic pathway but also stimulated protein synthesis which further regulates the loss of muscle mass [40].&amp;nbsp;...

HMB has been shown to stimulate the [[cell proliferation|proliferation]], [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]], and [[cell fusion|fusion]] of human [[myosatellite cells]] ''[[in vitro]]'', which potentially increases the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle, by increasing the protein expression of certain [[myogenic regulatory factors]] (e.g., [[myoD]] and [[myogenin]]) and gene [[transcription factor]]s (e.g., [[MEF2]]).&lt;ref name="ISSN position stand 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Systematic review December 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Human myosatellite cells in vitro" /&gt; HMB-induced human myosatellite cell proliferation ''in vitro'' is mediated through the phosphorylation of the [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]]s [[ERK1]] and [[ERK2]].&lt;ref name="Systematic review December 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HMB in animals 2015 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Szcześniak KA, Ostaszewski P, Fuller JC, Ciecierska A, Sadkowski T | title = Dietary supplementation of β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate in animals – a review | journal = Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition | volume = 99 | issue = 3 | pages = 405–417 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25099672 | doi = 10.1111/jpn.12234 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/jpn.12234#jpn12234-bib-0012 | quote = Cholesterol is a major component of the cell membrane, and sarcolemma is the one that relies mainly on de novo synthesis of cholesterol. This is important under stressful conditions when muscle cells may lack the capacity to produce adequate amounts of the cholesterol that is essential to proper functioning of cell membranes. Many biochemical studies have shown that HMB may be a precursor of cholesterol synthesis (Bachhawat et al., 1955; Bloch et al., 1954; Coon et al., 1955; Adamson and Greenberg, 1955; Gey et al., 1957). According to pertinent literature, HMB carbon is incorporated into cholesterol. Therefore, increased intramuscular HMB concentrations may provide readily available substrate for the cholesterol synthesis that is needed to form and stabilize the sarcolemma.&amp;nbsp;... It is known that HMB supplementation decreases post-exercise levels of enzymes, indicating muscle damage, such as creatinine phosphokinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which suggests an enhancement of the muscle cell membrane function. This was shown in numerous studies in humans undergoing both resistance and endurance training (Wilson et al., 2013)&amp;nbsp;... In theory, HMB use as a precursor to cholesterol could aid in stabilizing muscle cell membranes; however, this has not been confirmed by research studies.

It seems that HMB is able to act on three of the four major mechanisms involved in muscle deconditioning (protein turnover, apoptosis, and the regenerative process), whereas it is hypothesized to strongly affect the fourth (mitochondrial dynamics and functions). Moreover, HMB is inexpensive (~30– 50 US dollars per month at 3 g per day) and may prevent osteopenia (Bruckbauer and Zemel, 2013; Tatara, 2009; Tatara et al., 2007, 2008, 2012) and decrease cardiovascular risks (Nissen et al., 2000). For all these reasons, HMB should be routinely used in muscle-wasting conditions especially in aged people.&amp;nbsp;... 3&amp;nbsp;g of CaHMB taken three times a day (1&amp;nbsp;g each time) is the optimal posology, which allows for continual bioavailability of HMB in the body (Wilson et al., 2013)|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leucine metabolism" /&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt; Around&amp;nbsp;40% of dietary {{nowrap|{{smallcaps all|L}}-leucine}} is converted to {{nowrap|acetyl-CoA}}, which is subsequently used in the synthesis of other compounds.&lt;ref name="Leucine metabolism" /&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;

The vast majority of {{nowrap|{{smallcaps all|L}}-leucine}} metabolism is initially catalyzed by the [[branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase]] enzyme, producing {{nowrap|[[α-ketoisocaproate]]}} (α-KIC).&lt;ref name="HMB athletic performance-related effects 2011 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zanchi NE, Gerlinger-Romero F, Guimarães-Ferreira L, de Siqueira Filho MA, Felitti V, Lira FS, Seelaender M, Lancha AH | title = HMB supplementation: clinical and athletic performance-related effects and mechanisms of action | journal = Amino Acids | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 1015–1025 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 20607321 | doi = 10.1007/s00726-010-0678-0 | quote = HMB is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine (Van Koverin and Nissen 1992), an essential amino acid. The first step in HMB metabolism is the reversible transamination of leucine to [α-KIC] that occurs mainly extrahepatically (Block and Buse 1990). Following this enzymatic reaction, [α-KIC] may follow one of two pathways. In the first, HMB is produced from [α-KIC] by the cytosolic enzyme KIC dioxygenase (Sabourin and Bieber 1983). The cytosolic dioxygenase has been characterized extensively and differs from the mitochondrial form in that the dioxygenase enzyme is a cytosolic enzyme, whereas the dehydrogenase enzyme is found exclusively in the mitochondrion (Sabourin and Bieber 1981, 1983). Importantly, this route of HMB formation is direct and completely dependent of liver KIC dioxygenase. Following this pathway, HMB in the cytosol is first converted to cytosolic β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA), which can then be directed for cholesterol synthesis (Rudney 1957) (Fig. 1). In fact, numerous biochemical studies have shown that HMB is a precursor of cholesterol (Zabin and Bloch 1951; Nissen et al. 2000).&lt;!--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the second pathway, after transamination, [α-KIC] in liver generates isovaleryl-CoA through the enzymatic action of branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) and after several steps, there is production of HMG-CoA through the enzyme HMG-CoA synthase (Fig. 1). Under normal conditions the majority of KIC is converted into isovaleryl-CoA, in which approximately 5% of leucine is metabolized into HMB (Wilson et al. 2008; Van Koverin and Nissen 1992). However, Nissen and Abumrad (1997) provided evidence that the primary fate of HMB is probably conversion to HMG-CoA in the liver, for cholesterol biosynthesis.--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leucine metabolism"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors=Kohlmeier M | title=Nutrient Metabolism: Structures, Functions, and Genes | date=May 2015 | publisher=Academic Press | isbn=978-0-12-387784-0 | pages=385–388 | edition=2nd | section-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTQTAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA387&amp;q=beta-hydroxy%20beta-methylbutyrate%20HMB#v=onepage | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTQTAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage | accessdate=6 June 2016 | section=Leucine | quote=Energy fuel: Eventually, most Leu is broken down, providing about 6.0kcal/g.

A variety of synthetic routes to {{nowrap|β-hydroxy}} {{nowrap|β-methylbutyric}} acid have been developed. The first reported [[chemical syntheses]] approached HMB by oxidation of [[alkene]], [[vicinal (chemistry)|vicinal]] [[diol]], and [[alcohol]] precursors:

==History==

The first reported [[chemical synthesis]] of HMB was published in 1877 by the Russian chemists Michael and [[Alexander Mikhaylovich Zaytsev|Alexander Zaytsev]].&lt;ref name="First synthesis" /&gt; HMB was isolated from the bark of ''[[Erythrophleum|Erythrophleum couminga]]'' (a Madagascan tree) in 1941 by [[Leopold Ružička]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ružička L, Dalma G, Engel BG, Scott WE | author-link1 = Leopold Ružička | title = Zur Kenntnis der Erythrophleum-Alkaloide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2114">'''Clitoral photoplethysmography''' uses a [[direct current]] signal to measure [[clitoris| clitoral]] blood volume (CBV). 

A clitoral photoplethysmograph is a small clear [[Acrylic resin|acrylic]] device that contains a light source, and a light detector. The light source illuminates the [[capillary bed]] of the clitoral tissue and the blood circulating within it. As clitoral engorgement increases, more light is reflected into the photosensitive cell of the device. The clitoral photoplethysmograph is placed by the participant between the [[labia minora]]; the light detector is oriented toward the clitoris. It can be attached to a [[vaginal photoplethysmograph]] so that both CBV and [[vaginal photoplethysmograph|vaginal pulse amplitude]] (VPA) can be measured simultaneously.  

Gerritsen&lt;ref&gt;Gerritsen, J., van der Made, F., Bloemers, J., van Ham, D., Kleiverda, G., Everaerd, W., et al. ["The clitoral photoplethysmograph: A new way of assessing genital arousal in women"], "Journal of Sexual Medicine, 6, 1678 – 1687", 2009&lt;/ref&gt; found clitoral photoplethysmography to be a [[construct validity| valid]] and sensitive tool for measuring female genital response. In contrast to vaginal photoplethysmography, clitoral photoplethysmographs are sensitive to the inhibition of sexual response. The authors suggest that clitoral photoplethysmography is particularly informative for examining sexual inhibition. Some researchers have posited that the procedure might be a viable instrument for assessing female sex offenders.&lt;ref&gt;Schlank, Anita, Saprina Matheny, and Jessica Schilling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4902">The '''Disability History Association''' (DHA) is an international [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] that promotes the study of [[Disability|disabilities]]. This includes, but is not limited to, the history of individuals or groups with disabilities, perspectives on disability, representations/ constructions of disability, policy and practice history, teaching, theory, and disability and related social and [[civil rights movements]].

The DHA defines both history and disability widely. This organization is both inclusive and international, reflected in its diverse topics and approaches. Membership is open to scholars, institutions and organizations, and others working in all geographic regions and all time periods.

The DHA offers its members a community of active and interesting historians; access to its resources page, which includes a newsletter, conference information, sample syllabi, and helpful links; as well as an opportunity to help build an exciting field.

As an [[Learned society|academic organization]], the Disability History Association strives to attract more professional and public attention to the importance of disability as a category of analysis and the histories of people with disabilities in the past and present. As the DHA website says: “This organization is both inclusive and international, reflected in our diverse topics and approaches. Membership is open to scholars, institutions and organizations, and others working in all geographic regions and all time periods.”&lt;ref&gt;“About our website,” URL: http://dev.celestesharpe.com/?page_id=2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Disability History Association is an affiliated member of the [[American Historical Association]] (AHA) and the [[Organization of American Historians]] (OAH) to promote inclusivity of disability in the profession and discipline.

==History of the Disability History Association==

The origin of the Disability History Association came from informal conversations by a group of pioneering disability scholars at the Summer Institute on Disability Studies in the Humanities at [[San Francisco State University]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Kudlick, Catherine, “Disability History Association”, in Burch, Susan. Encyclopedia of American Disability History. Facts on File Library of American History. New York: Facts On File, 2009: 277.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, they created H-Disability, a discussion group in the prominent online scholarly platform [[H-Net]].&lt;ref&gt;The earliest discussion we can trace in the H-Disability is a book review posted in March, 2001, which is called “Saunders on The Workhouse” (Citation: Kathy Saunders. Review of, The Workhouse. H-Disability, H-Net Reviews. March, 2001. URL: http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=15084).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the organization held its first board meeting, and then the community was incorporated into the Disability History Association in 2007. In 2008, the Disability History Association, British Disability History Group, and the San Francisco State University cosponsored an international academic conference for disability history.

'''Duplex strainer''' or twin basket strainer is a type of filter built into a fuel, oil or water piping system and it is used to remove large particles of dirt and [[debris]]. The duplex strainer system usually consists of two separate strainer baskets housings. The system also contains a valve handle placed between the two baskets to divert the flow of liquid to one strainer while the other is being cleaned. On some strainers, the valve will work automatically and the strainer will perform a self-cleaning operation.

These types of strainers are installed in pipeline systems where flow cannot be stopped. Depending upon their NB size they are capable of filtration up to 40&amp;nbsp;[[µm]]. Basket Strainers find use in industries where impurities are mostly solids. Unlike other types of strainers, it is easy to conduct maintenance on these strainers.

Duplex strainers are mainly used in various industries such as [[process industry]], power industry, chemical industry, oil and gas industry, pulp and paper industry, pharmaceutical industry, metals and mining industry, water and waste management, fire fighting industry, refineries and petrochemical plants. Strainers are used to remove hazardous elements that might cause partial or complete breakdown of operations if they get into the system.

Economic evaluations can take a number of forms, namely:
* [[Cost-benefit analysis]]
* [[Cost-effectiveness analysis]]
* [[Cost-utility analysis]]
* [[Cost-consequences analysis]]

'''Emergen-C''' is an effervescent, powdered [[drink mix]] [[vitamin supplement]] manufactured by Alacer Corp.  The Emergen-C product line was introduced in 1978.&lt;ref name='About'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emergenc.com/index.php/misc/alacer |title=About Alacer Corp. |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alacer was established as a private company in 1972, focusing on vitamin supplements containing [[vitamin C]]. In 2012, the company was acquired by [[Pfizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120227006543/en/Pfizer-Acquires-Alacer-Corp.-Leading-Vitamin-Supplements |title=Pfizer Acquires Alacer Corp., a Leading Vitamin Supplements Company|publisher=BusinessWire |date=2012-02-17 |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/91435/pfizer-tops-guides-in-line]&lt;/ref&gt;

It contains, depending on the variety, 16 times the [[vitamin C]], 4 times the [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], and 5 times the [[vitamin B6|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[Reference Daily Intake]] based on a 2000 [[calorie]] diet. Some versions include [[calcium]], [[glucosamine]], [[quercetin]] or [[lycopene]]. Studies have failed to establish evidence for the use of vitamin C megadoses as a cold remedy or in reducing cold incidences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000980.pub4 | title=Vitamin C for preventing and treating the common cold | journal=Reviews | last1 = Hemilä | first1 = Harri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing==
Alacer manufactures its products in the United States, in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emergenc.com/index.php/misc/faq |title=Alacer Corp FAQ |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingredients==
[[GMO]] ingredients are used. From the Alacer website: "We have chosen to source materials that are non-GMO whenever possible. That being said, we cannot guarantee that all of our raw materials are sourced from non-GMO ingredients and do not currently have this requirement in place for our vendors".  Most products do not contain animal-derived ingredients, but some certain products contain [[chondroitin]] from cows, [[honey]], and [[vitamin D3|vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] from wool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Emergen-C Vegan?|url=http://www.isitvegan.com/2012/02/25/is-emergen-c-vegan/|website=Is It Vegan?|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Class Action Lawsuit ==
In December 2013, a superior court judge preliminarily approved a $6.45 million settlement to a class-action lawsuit filed against Alacer Corp. for alleged deceptive marketing. The complaint, which was originally filed earlier in the year, alleged that the company misleadingly represented that the supplement would provide health benefits – including reducing the risk of or preventing colds and flu – without scientific evidence to support such claims. According to the settlement terms, class members may receive a refund of up to $36 with proof of purchase. (''Wong et al v. Alacer Corp.,'' Case No. CGC-12-519221, Superior Court of California County of San Francisco).  A superior court judge gave final approval of the settlement to this lawsuit in June 2014.{{Citation needed |reason='no indication that this settlement was ever executed' |date=April 2017}}

==Outreach==
In 1997, Alacer established The Emergen-C Fund, which has raised more than $650,000.
This fund provides support to [[Vitamin Angels]], [[Surfrider Foundation]], [[Keep A Breast Foundation]], [[Young Survival Coalition]], and [[Whole Foods]]' Whole Planet Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergenc.com/fund |title=Emergen-C Fund Charities |accessdate=2012-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211043347/http://emergenc.com/fund |archivedate=2012-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alacer sponsors [[Operation Gratitude]], a volunteer organization that has sent care packages to U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name='About'/&gt;

In 2008 Emergen-C teamed up with surf artist [[Jay Alders]] to create art for the packaging of their new product/flavor, Emergen-C Blue, with 25 cents donated to [[Surfrider Foundation]] for each box sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surfersvillage.com/surfing/38799/news.htm |title=Emergen-C launches a new product to benefit Surfrider |date=2009-02-03 |website= |publisher=Surfersvillage.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204221123/http://www.surfersvillage.com/surfing/38799/news.htm |archivedate=February 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2011-02-11 |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surfrider.org/partners/entry/emergen-c Emergen-C | Surfrider Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005235/http://www.surfrider.org/partners/entry/emergen-c |date=2013-12-03 }}.

The cause of EE is multifactorial. Overall, exposure to contaminated food and water leads to a generalized state of intestinal inflammation.&lt;ref name=ali2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=korpe2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=louis2017/&gt; The inflammatory response results in multiple pathological changes to the gastrointestinal tract: [[atrophy|Smaller villi]], larger crypts (called [[intestinal crypts|crypt hyperplasia]]), increased [[intestinal permeability|permeability]], and inflammatory cell build-up within the intestines.&lt;ref name="korpe2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="louis2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prendergast2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prendergast|first1=A|last2=Kelly|first2=P|title=Enteropathies in the developing world: neglected effects on global health.|journal=The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|date=May 2012|volume=86|issue=5|pages=756–63|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0743|pmid=22556071|pmc=3335677}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes result in poor absorption of food, vitamins and minerals. 

Standardized, clinically practical diagnostic criteria do not exist. The most accurate diagnostic test is intestinal biopsy. However, this test is invasive and unnecessary for most patients.&lt;ref name="ali2016" /&gt;

Prevention is the strongest and most reliable option for preventing EE and its effects. Therefore, prevention and treatment of EE are often discussed together.&lt;ref name="prendergast2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="humphrey2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Humphrey|first1=JH|date=2009|title=Child undernutrition, tropical enteropathy, toilets, and handwashing.|journal=Lancet|volume=374|issue=9694|pages=1032–5|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(09)60950-8|pmid=19766883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mbuya|first1=MN|last2=Humphrey|first2=JH|title=Preventing environmental enteric dysfunction through improved water, sanitation and hygiene: an opportunity for stunting reduction in developing countries.|journal=Maternal &amp; child nutrition|date=May 2016|volume=12 Suppl 1|pages=106–20|doi=10.1111/mcn.12220|pmid=26542185|pmc=5019251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
Environmental enteropathy is believed to result in chronic [[malnutrition]] and subsequent [[growth stunting]] (low height-for-age measurement) as well as other child development deficits.

===Short-term ===
EE is rarely symptomatic and is considered a [[subclinical]] condition.&lt;ref name=ali2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=louis2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=korpe2012/&gt; However, adults may have mild symptoms or malabsorption such as altered stool consistency, increased stool frequency and weight loss.

===Long-term ===
* Malnutrition &lt;ref name="ali2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="korpe2012" /&gt;
** EE causes [[Malnutrition in children|malnutrition]] by way of both [[malabsorption]] and nutritional deficiencies.
* Growth and physical development &lt;ref name="prendergast2012" /&gt;
** The first two years (and the prior 9 months of fetal life) are critical for linear growth. Stunting is an easy to measure symptom of these child development deficits.
* Neurocognitive (brain development) &lt;ref name="bhutta2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="john2017" /&gt;
* Effect on oral vaccination &lt;ref name="czerkinsky2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilmartin|first=Allissia A.|last2=Petri|first2=William A.|date=2015-06-19|title=Exploring the role of environmental enteropathy in malnutrition, infant development and oral vaccine response|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B|language=en|volume=370|issue=1671|pages=20140143|doi=10.1098/rstb.2014.0143|pmid=25964455|pmc=4527388}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Many oral [[vaccines]], both live and non-living, have proven to be less immunogenic or less protective when administered to [[infants]], children or adults living in low socioeconomic conditions in [[developing countries]] than they are when used in [[industrialized countries]]. Widespread EE is hypothesized to be a contributing cause for this observation.
[[File:Poliodrops.jpg|thumb|Child receiving oral polio vaccine. There is some evidence that the enteric dysfunction characteristic of EE may impair the efficacy of oral vaccinations.]]

== Causes and mechanism ==

The development of EE is multifactorial, but predominantly associated with chronic exposure to contaminated food and water. This is especially true in environments where widespread [[open defecation]] and lack of [[sanitation]] are common.&lt;ref name="ali2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="korpe2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="louis2017" /&gt;

Long-term exposure to environmental pathogens leads to a generalized state of intestinal inflammation. Chronic inflammation leads to both functional and structural changes which alter gut permeability and ability of the intestine to absorb nutrients.&lt;ref name="ali2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="korpe2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="louis2017" /&gt;
[[File:Villous atrophy in endoscopic images.png|thumb|Evidence of villous atrophy in endoscopic images of the small intestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Louis-Auguste|first=John|last2=Kelly|first2=Paul|date=2017-07-01|title=Tropical Enteropathies|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11894-017-0570-0|journal=Current Gastroenterology Reports|language=en|volume=19|issue=7|pages=29|doi=10.1007/s11894-017-0570-0|issn=1522-8037|pmid=28540669|pmc=5443857}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Specifically, structural changes within the intestine include [[atrophy|smaller villi]], larger crypts (called [[intestinal crypts|crypt hyperplasia]]), increased permeability, and inflammatory cell build-up within the intestines. These changes result in poor absorption of food, vitamins and minerals – or "modest [[malabsorption]]".&lt;ref name="ali2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="korpe2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="louis2017" /&gt;
[[File:Environmental enteropathy - mechanism model.png|thumb|Simplified mechanism outlining causes and effects of EE.]]

==Diagnosis==
The current gold standard diagnostic test for EE is intestinal biopsy and histological analysis. Histological changes observed include:&lt;ref name="louis2017" /&gt;
* Villous blunting
* Crypt hypertrophy
* Villous fusion
* Mucosal inflammation
However, this procedure is considered  too invasive, complex and expensive to be implemented as standard of care.&lt;ref name="ali2016" /&gt; As a result, there are various research efforts underway to identify [[biomarker]]s associated with EE, which could serve as less invasive, yet representative, tools to screen for and identify EE from stool samples.&lt;ref name="ali2016" /&gt;

In an effort to identify simple, accurate diagnostic tests for EE, the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] (BMGF) has established an EE biomarkers consortium as part of their [[Global Grand Challenges]] initiative (specifically, the Discover Biomarkers of Gut Function challenge).&lt;ref name="ali2016" /&gt;

So far, various biomarkers have been selected and studied based on the current understanding of EE pathophysiology:&lt;ref name="ali2016" /&gt;
* [[Intestinal mucosal barrier|Gut permeability]]/barrier function
** Dual sugar permeability ([[lactose]]-to-[[mannitol]] ratio)
* Intestinal inflammation
** [[Alpha-1 antitrypsin|Alpha-1 anti-trypsin]]
** [[Neopterin]]
** [[Myeloperoxidase]] 
* [[Exocrine gland|Exocrine]] (hormonal) markers
* Bacterial translocation markers
** Endotoxin core antibody
* Markers of systemic inflammation
** [[Alpha-1-B glycoprotein|Alpha-1 glycoprotein]]
** [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP)&amp;nbsp;
It is postulated that the limited of understanding of EE is partially due to the paucity of reliable biomarkers, making it difficult for researchers to track the epidemiology of the condition and assess the efficacy of interventions.&lt;ref name="prendergast2012" /&gt;

=== Classification ===
In the 1960s, researchers reported a syndrome of non-specific [[histopathological]] and functional changes to the [[small intestine]] in individuals living in unsanitary conditions.&lt;ref name=korpe2012/&gt; This syndrome was observed predominantly in tropical regions across Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The geographic distribution of the syndrome lead to the original term of "tropical enteropathy" (sometimes also "tropical jejunopathy").&lt;ref name=korpe2012/&gt;

Following initial reports, further investigation revealed that these symptoms were not specific to tropical climates. For example, individuals in more wealthy tropical countries, such as Qatar and Singapore, did not exhibit these symptoms.&lt;ref name=louis2017/&gt; Similarly, subsequent studies have shown this condition to be common across the developing world, closely associated with impoverished conditions but independent of climate or geography.&lt;ref name=louis2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=prendergast2012/&gt; As a result, the term "environmental enteropathy" was introduced to specify that this condition is not only found in tropical areas and is believed to be caused by environmental factors.&lt;ref name=korpe2012/&gt;

==Prevention and treatment==
[[File:AFRICA BASIN AND PITCHER FOR WASHING HANDS.jpg|thumb|Sanitary measures, such as hand-washing before preparing food, is recommended in the prevention of EE.]]

Prevention focuses on improving sanitation of water and food sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mbuya|first=Mduduzi N. N.|last2=Humphrey|first2=Jean H.|date=2016-05-01|title=Preventing environmental enteric dysfunction through improved water, sanitation and hygiene: an opportunity for stunting reduction in developing countries|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mcn.12220/abstract|journal=Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition|language=en|volume=12|pages=106–120|doi=10.1111/mcn.12220|issn=1740-8709|pmid=26542185|pmc=5019251}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ngure|first=Francis M.|last2=Reid|first2=Brianna M.|last3=Humphrey|first3=Jean H.|last4=Mbuya|first4=Mduduzi N.|last5=Pelto|first5=Gretel|last6=Stoltzfus|first6=Rebecca J.|date=2014-01-01|title=Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), environmental enteropathy, nutrition, and early child development: making the links|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.12330/abstract|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=1308|issue=1|pages=118–128|doi=10.1111/nyas.12330|issn=1749-6632|pmid=24571214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important factor might be contaminated soil in child play spaces, often caused by the presence of livestock such as chicken in the household. Creating a clean play space might therefore be an effective preventive measure for EE in toddlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=George|first1=Christine Marie|title=Enteric Infections in Young Children are Associated with Environmental Enteropathy and Impaired Growth|journal=Tropical medicine and international health|date=11 December 2017|volume=23|issue=1|doi=10.1111/tmi.13002|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tmi.13002/full|accessdate=11 January 2018|pages=26–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment focuses on addressing the central components of intestinal inflammation, bacterial overgrowth and nutritional supplementation.&lt;ref name="ali2016" /&gt;

The '''European Institute for Health Records''' or '''EuroRec Institute''' is a non-profit organization founded in 2002 as part of the [[ProRec]] initiative. On 13 May 2003, the institute was established as a non-profit organization under [[France|French]] law. Current President of EuroRec is Prof. [[Dipak Kalra]]. The institute is involved in the promotion of high quality [[Electronic Health Record]] systems in the [[European Union]]. One of the main missions of the institute is to support, as the European authorised certification body, EHRs certification development, testing and assessment by defining functional and other criteria.

The objectives of the institute are:
# To federate the established ProRec centres that comply with a set of explicit criteria. 
# To develop specifically those activities that cannot be handled at the level of ProRec centres and/or within their scope, according to the principle of subsidiarity and in view of both synergy and [[economy of scale]].

==European projects==

===ARGOS===
The main goal of the ARGOS project was to contribute to creating "Transatlantic Observatory for Meeting Global Health Policy Challenges through ICT-Enabled Solutions" to allow promotion of "Common Methods for Responding to Global eHealth Challenges in the EU and the US".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurorec.org/RD/argos.cfm|title=ARGOS|accessdate=2013-01-06 |last= |first= |year= 2013 |format= webpage |publisher= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results are used to provide various users recommendations in sustaining co-ordinated actions. It is important to both Europe and America of United States because:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurorec.org/RD/argos.cfm|title=ARGOS|accessdate=2013-01-06 |last= |first= |year= 2013 |format= webpage |publisher= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*There is a barrier in fostering healthcare globally as citizens travel and migrate
*It will help improve their products to better promote themselves in global markets
*The global experiences will become important information for both Europe and America

Through the challenges of enhancing ehealth strategy development, promoting benefits of consistent strategies and supporting large scale ehealth infrastructure implementations will allow Europe and United States researchers and policy makers gain mutual understanding and learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurorec.org/RD/argos.cfm|title=ARGOS|accessdate=2013-01-06 |last= |first= |year= 2013 |format= webpage |publisher= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main topics that were address within this project was; ehealth interoperability an EHR certifications, establishing an approach and identification of indicators of the usage and benefits of ehealth, and aiding clinicians in diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases through human physiology and disease modelling and simulation. However the project has highlighted challenges in  establishing competent ehealth informatics staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurorec.org/RD/argos.cfm|title=ARGOS|accessdate=2013-01-06 |last= |first= |year= 2013 |format= webpage |publisher= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are variations of understanding, qualification and definition of workforce requirements through Europe and The United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurorec.org/RD/argos.cfm|title=ARGOS|accessdate=2013-01-06 |last= |first= |year= 2013 |format= webpage |publisher= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HITCH: Healthcare Interoperability Testing and Conformance Harmonisation===
HITCH project begun 01/01/10 and ended on the 30/06/11. The objective of this project was to involve major stakeholders in defining and agreeing a roadmap that is essential to the foundation for the Interoperability Conformance Testing of information systems in the field of healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurorec.org/RD/hitch.cfm|title=HITCH |accessdate=2013-06-06 |last= |first= |year= 2013 |format= webpage |publisher= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; HITCH project aims to propose plans on achieving interoperability conformance testing foundation starting 2011 through evaluating existing approaches and identifying potential gaps in initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurorec.org/RD/hitch.cfm|title=HITCH |accessdate=2013-06-06 |last= |first= |year= 2013 |format= webpage |publisher= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The roadmap will identify specific needs in improving processes and tools development that will support research. The roadmap will be tested in real-world settings with healthcare IT applications to determine the next logicals steps in establishing a credibility amongst major stakeholders (vendors, users, patients and authorities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurorec.org/RD/hitch.cfm|title=HITCH |accessdate=2013-06-06 |last= |first= |year= 2013 |format= webpage |publisher= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Q-REC: European Quality Labelling and Certification of Electronic Health Record systems (EHRs)===
The Q-REC project started 01/01/06 and finished on 30/06/08. It is a project that is a Specific Support Action and its objective is to supplement the existing e-Health ERA Co-ordination Project "Towards the establishment of a European e Health Research Area". It aims is to create an credible, sustainable and efficient means in certifying EHR system in Europe by concentrating EHR Systems Quality Labeling and Certification Development, Resources for EHR interoperatability, and Benchmarking Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurorec.org/rd/pastproject_q-rec.cfm|title=Q-REC |accessdate=2013-12-05 |last= |first= |year= 2013 |format= webpage |publisher= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the goals stated by Q-REC and EuroREC webpage &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurorec.org/rd/pastproject_q-rec.cfm|title=Q-REC |accessdate=2013-12-05 |last= |first= |year= 2013 |format= webpage |publisher= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; includes:

''' EHR Systems Quality Labelling and Certification Development'''

*Developing a modern report on EHR-Certification Schemas that has been implemented in at least three European countries;
*Completing a Pan-European Requirements Assay;
*Proposing a Labelling Terminology and Functional Profiles for EHRs to be certified;
*Comparing and harmonising the EHR-Certification Procedures at a European level;
*Drafting Model Certification Guidelines and Procedures;
*Planning the Validation of the Guidelines.

''' Resources for EHR Interoperability'''

*Producing a register for Conformance Criteria and Guidance Documents for obtaining EHR Certification;
*Establishing EHR Archetypes guidelines and inventory;
*Establishing a registration process for Coding Schemes in Europe (as mandated by CEN/TC 251);
*Providing relevant EHR related standards inventory;

'''Benchmarking Services'''

*Defining services that uses benchmarking for Manual for Quality Labelling and Certification;
*Preparing the Business Plan for new EHR-Certification related Services

This project was done with EuroRec institute whose mission was to promote high quality EHRs throughout Europe. Through its networks and its centres acting as platforms along with the collaboration with eHealth ERA consortium and European Health Care Authorities (HCA)/ Ministries groups, EuroRec has provided various methods in assessing the needs and optimal choice methods for quality labelling and certification of EHRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurorec.org/rd/pastproject_q-rec.cfm|title=Q-REC |accessdate=2013-12-05 |last= |first= |year= 2013 |format= webpage |publisher= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RIDE: A Roadmap for Interoperability of [[eHealth]] Systems in Support of COM 356 with Special Emphasis on Semantic Interoperability===
RIDE is a project that aims to provide a solid foundation for the action plans of eHealth Communication COM 356. It begun on 01/01/06 and ended on 31/12/07. Through research and development into the interoperability of eHealth systems, meaningful recommendations can be made for actions at a European level. The lack of complete harmonisation between clinical practice, terminology and EHR systems have highlighted that there is an unrealistic expectation in developing a single universally clinical data model. Hence the RIDE project objective is to provide a roadmap through focusing on current limitations of policies and strategies in solutions for ehealth interoperability and assessing health's European best practices in regards to providing semantic interoperability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurorec.org/rd/pastproject_ride.cfm |title=RIDE|accessdate=2013-12-05 |last= |first= |year= 2013 |format= webpage |publisher= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EHR-IMPLEMENT: National policies for EHR Implementation in the European area: social and organizational issues===
The objective of EHR-IMPLEMENT is to provide best practice, policy and strategic recommendations in the implementation of EHR in Europe. This is done though the collection and analysis of EHR implementations in various countries. Previous EHR projects have always addressed the technological area in EHR. Other commonly overlooked in projects, the EHR-IMPLEMENT will focus the social and organisational on a broad national initiative, as these factor may potentially hinder, if not ruin the EHR implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurorec.org/RD/ehr_implement.cfm|title=National policies for EHR Implementation in the European area: social and organizational issues|accessdate=2013-12-05 |last= |first= |year= 2013 |format= webpage |publisher= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This project comprised a case study approach and a foused survey at a European level. It aims to analyse and collect information on best practices and eloborate recommendations for policy makers to facilitate EHR into member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurorec.org/RD/ehr_implement.cfm|title=National policies for EHR Implementation in the European area: social and organizational issues|accessdate=2013-12-05 |last= |first= |year= 2013 |format= webpage |publisher= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to EuroREC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurorec.org/RD/ehr_implement.cfm|title=National policies for EHR Implementation in the European area: social and organizational issues|accessdate=2013-12-05 |last= |first= |year= 2013 |format= webpage |publisher= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; these are the main objectives of the projects:

*Analysis of national policies and strategies for the implementation of EHR
*Conducting a survey regarding policy and action plans for National Implementation of EHR into Member States.
*Investigating EHR users in the implementation process.
*Raising issues of EHR implementation
*Identifying best practices towards EHR implementation in Europe
*Promoting information sharing and mutual learning through supporting the development of a community of scientific experts, technical personnel and National Health System representatives
*Providing results and recommendations of the project amongst stakeholders across Europe

'''Food heritage''' is a term that encompasses the origins of [[plants]] and animals and their dispersal, the sites where people first cultivated plants and [[domesticated animals]], as well as the earliest locations around the world where people first processed, prepared, sold and ate foods. These locations include [[farms]], all types of [[mill (grinding)|mill]], [[dairies]], [[orchards]], [[vineyards]], [[breweries]], [[restaurants]] and [[cafes]], [[markets]] and [[groceries]], [[hotels]] and [[inns]]. 
[[Food museums]] help to preserve global and local food [[cultural heritage|heritage]]. [[Agropolis]] Museum in [[Montpellier]], [[France]] is an example of an actual museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6893">The Healthcare system in [[Kazakhstan]] is a post-Soviet healthcare system under reform.

== Overview ==

Life expectancy at birth in Kazakhstan is 148th in the world, below most developed nations and some developing nations. It is below the average life expectancy for the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html CIA Factbook, Life expectancy by country.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html CIA Factbook, Infant mortality rate by country.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), in 2000, ranked the Kazakhstani healthcare system as the 64th in overall performance, and 135th by overall level of health (among 191 member nations included in the study).

==History==
The quality of healthcare, which remained entirely under state control in 2006, declined in the post-Soviet era because of insufficient funding and the loss of technical experts through emigration. Between 1989 and 2001, the ratio of [[physician|doctors]] per 10,000 inhabitants fell by 15% , to 34.6, and the ratio of hospital beds per 10,000 inhabitants fell by 46%, to 74. By 2005 those indicators had recovered somewhat, to 55 and 77, respectively. Since 1991, health care has consistently lacked adequate government funding; in 2005 only 2.5% of [[gross domestic product]] went for that purpose. A government health reform program aims to increase that figure to 4% in 2010. A compulsory [[health insurance]] system has been in the planning stages for several years. Wages for health workers are extremely low, and equipment is in critically short supply. The main foreign source of medical equipment is Japan. Because of cost, the emphasis of treatment increasingly is on outpatient care instead of the hospital care preferred under the Soviet system. The health system is in crisis in rural areas such as the [[Aral Sea]] region, where health is most affected by [[pollution]].&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Kazakhstan.pdf Kazakhstancountry profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (December 2006). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common diseases are [[Respiratory disease|respiratory infections]], [[Cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular conditions]], and [[tuberculosis]]. Since 2000, the incidence of [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) has increased, as has the incidence of environment-linked [[cancers]]. In 2003 an estimated 23,000 citizens had HIV. Because of increasing numbers of people in high-risk categories, such as female sex workers and intravenous [[narcotics]] users, experts forecast an increase in that figure. In 2003 an estimated 80 percent of cases were narcotics-related. In 2006 an outbreak of juvenile HIV caused by improper hospital techniques gained national attention. In the first nine months of 2006, some 1,285 new cases were reported officially.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

37 mothers died per 100,000 live births in 2009. The maternal mortality rate had gone down slightly in comparison to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/197402/index.en.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Healthcare System==

'''Healthcare in Kazakhstan''' is provided by a network of primary, secondary and tertiary care facilities. Healthcare facilities are largely owned and operated by the [[public sector]] represented by the Ministry of Health. Health insurance is now primarily provided by the government in the public sector.

==Providers==
[[Healthcare provider]]s in Kazakhstan encompass individual healthcare personnel, healthcare facilities and medical products.

==Facilities==
{{Main|Hospitals in Kazakhstan}}

The [[public hospital]]s share of total hospital capacity has remained relatively stable (about 70%) for decades.  There are also [[For-profit hospital|privately owned for-profit hospitals]] as well as [[public hospital|government hospitals]] in some locations, mainly owned by county and city governments.

There is a nationwide system of government-owned medical facilities open to the general public. The national [[Department of Defense of Kazakhstan|Department of Defense]] operates field hospitals as well as permanent hospitals (the [[Military Health System]]), to provide military-funded care to active military personnel.

[[Hospital]]s provide some outpatient care in their emergency rooms and specialty clinics, but primarily exist to provide inpatient care. Hospital [[emergency department]]s and [[urgent care]] centers are sources of sporadic problem-focused care. [[Hospice]] services for the terminally ill who are expected to live six months or less are most commonly subsidized by charities and government. Prenatal, [[family planning]] care is government-funded [[obstetric]] and [[gynaecological]] specialty and provided in primary care facilities, and are usually staffed by nurse practitioners (midwives).

A big share of medical health care is delivered through a vast network of primary care facilities called ambulatories and policlinics.

== [[Ministry of Health of Kazakhstan|Ministry of Health]] ==

One of executive branches in Kazakhstani government to control, regulate and organize the delivery of social services in [[public health]] and medical care. One of the office head was [[Salidat Kayirbekova]].

== Medical Universities ==
* [[Kazakh National Medical University]]
* [[Qaraghandy State Medical University|Karaganda State Medical University]]

== [[National Medical Holding]] ==

National Medical Holding is an experimental health system located in capital city [[Astana]]. Its purpose is to be "medical cluster", so new health technologies could be acquired, developed and disseminated across the nation. It comprises several [[hospital]]s under centralized management, and as of 2012 is subordinated to [[Nazarbayev University]].

==Non-governmental organizations==

Multiple domestic and international health [[NGO]]s conduct their work in Kazakhstan.

== Quality of Care in Kazakhstan ==

Enacted in 2010, new Code of Health proposed several changes in existing procedures in healthcare quality assurance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19528">The '''physical and mental health of [[Abraham Lincoln]]''' has been the subject of both contemporaneous commentary and subsequent hypotheses by historians and scholars.

==Physical health==

Despite the following occurrences, Lincoln's health up until middle age was fairly good for his day.&lt;ref name=alh&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abrahamlincolnsclassroom.org/Library/newsletter.asp?ID=25&amp;CRLI=105 |publisher=The Lincoln Institute |title=Abraham Lincoln's Health |accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shutes |first=Milton H. |title=Lincoln's Emotional Life |page=103 |year=1957 |asin=B001OKE1F0 |publisher=Dorrance &amp; Company }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood===

There were fears for young Lincoln's life during a 24-hour period of unconsciousness that followed a horse kicking him in the head.  He was nine years old when this occurred.

===Infectious disease===

* '''Malaria''': Lincoln had [[malaria]] at least twice.  The first was in 1830, along with the rest of his family.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos2|Sotos, "Sourcebook"]], paragraphs 2001-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  They had just arrived in [[Illinois]] that year.  The second episode was in the summer of 1835, while living in [[Lincoln's New Salem|New Salem]].  Lincoln was then so ill, he was sent to a neighbor's house to be medicated and cared for.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos2|Sotos, "Sourcebook"]], pages 385-386.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Syphilis''': Claims that Lincoln had [[syphilis]] about 1835 have been controversial. The most recent analysis by a physician accepts the diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos2|Sotos, "Sourcebook"]], pages 390-400.&lt;/ref&gt; All biographers reject the claim.  Lincoln's law partner, friend and biographer [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]] said Lincoln contracted the disease, specifically stating that "Lincoln told me this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Hidden Lincoln: From the Letters and Papers of William H. Herndon
|publisher=Viking Press
|year=1938
|page=259
|author=Hertz, Emanuel (ed.)}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Herndon, believing both [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]] and Abraham Lincoln had syphilis, suspected it in the premature death of 3 Lincoln children. Abe Lincoln was known to take mercury, presumably for his condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1200645 | pmid=16200093 | volume=17 | issue=1 | title=Facts and ideas from anywhere | year=2004 | journal=Proc (Bayl Univ Med Cent) | pages=89–94 | last1 = Roberts | first1 = WC | doi=10.1080/08998280.2004.11927961}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no physical evidence that Lincoln had the disease, but physical evidence would not necessarily be expected, given that 50% of infections do not progress beyond a transient local infection, even without treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Neurosyphilis
|publisher=Oxford University Press
|year=1946
|page=4
|author=Merritt, H. Houston|display-authors=etal}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Syphilis was a common worry among young men before the introduction of penicillin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas L. Wilson|title=Honor's Voice: The Transformation of Abraham Lincoln|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCM50uZMsQMC&amp;pg=PA129|year=2011|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|pages=129, 184|isbn=9780307765819}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not unexpected, given the commonness of syphilis in that era.  Writing in 2003, biographer [[David Herbert Donald|David Donald]] declared, "Modern physicians who have sifted the evidence agree that Lincoln never contracted the disease,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Herbert Donald|title=We Are Lincoln Men: Abraham Lincoln and His Friends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OjyfM61m620C&amp;pg=PA99|year=2004|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=99|isbn=9780743254700}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, these physicians have never published their analyses.
* '''Smallpox''': Lincoln contracted [[smallpox]] shortly after delivering the [[Gettysburg Address]] in November 1863. Long thought to have been only a mild case, recent work suggests it was a serious illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Johnson]] contracted the disease and ultimately died from it.

===Trauma===

Lincoln died from a bullet wound to the head in 1865.  His other episodes of adult trauma were minor. He was clubbed on the head during a robbery attempt in 1828,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos2|Sotos, "Sourcebook"]], paragraph 3582.&lt;/ref&gt; was struck by his wife (apparently on multiple occasions),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos2|Sotos, "Sourcebook"]], paragraph 3589.&lt;/ref&gt; cut his hand with an axe at least once,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos2|Sotos, "Sourcebook"]], paragraph 1490.&lt;/ref&gt; and incurred frostbite of his feet in 1830-1831.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos2|Sotos, "Sourcebook"]], paragraph 930.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body habitus===

The shape ("habitus") of Lincoln's body attracted attention while he was alive, and continues to attract attention today among medical professionals.&lt;ref name="Sotos pages 194-204"&gt;[[#Sotos|Sotos, "The Physical Lincoln"]], pages 194-204.&lt;/ref&gt;  Geneticists are now skeptical of the hypothesis that [[Marfan syndrome]] was the cause of his unusual habitus (see below).

* '''Height''': as a child, Lincoln was tall, describing himself as "though very young, he was large of his age."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos2|Sotos, "Sourcebook"]], paragraph 478.&lt;/ref&gt; He reached his adult height of 6 feet 4 inches (1.93&amp;nbsp;m) no later than age 21.
* '''Weight''': although well-muscled as a young adult, he was always thin. Questionable evidence says Lincoln weighed over 200 pounds (90&amp;nbsp;kg) in 1831,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos2|Sotos, "Sourcebook"]], paragraph 363.&lt;/ref&gt; but this is inconsistent with the emphatic statement of Henry Lee Ross ("The facts are Lincoln never weighed over 175 pounds in his life"),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos2|Sotos, "Sourcebook"]], paragraph 368.&lt;/ref&gt; the recollection of David Turnham ("weighed about 160 lbs in 1830"),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos2|Sotos, "Sourcebook"]], paragraph 361.&lt;/ref&gt; and a New Salem neighbor named Camron ("thin as a beanpole and ugly as a scarecrow").  Lincoln's self-reported weight was 180&amp;nbsp;lbs (81.5&amp;nbsp;kg) in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos2|Sotos, "Sourcebook"]], paragraph 369.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is believed to have weighed even less during his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Marfan syndrome''': based on Lincoln's unusual physical appearance, Dr. Abraham Gordon proposed in 1962 that Lincoln had [[Marfan syndrome]].  Testing Lincoln's [[DNA]] for Marfan syndrome was contemplated in the 1990s, but such a test was not performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

: Lincoln's unremarkable [[cardiovascular]] history and his normal visual acuity have been the chief objections to the hypothesis, and today geneticists consider the diagnosis unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Multiple endocrine neoplasia''': in 2007, Dr. John Sotos proposed that Lincoln had [[multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b]] (MEN2B).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos|Sotos, "The Physical Lincoln"]].&lt;/ref&gt;  This hypothesis suggests Lincoln had all the major features of the disease: a marfan-like body shape, large, bumpy lips, [[constipation]], [[hypotonia]], a history compatible with [[cancer]]—to which Sotos ascribes the death of Lincoln's sons [[Edward Baker Lincoln|Eddie]], [[William Wallace Lincoln|Willie]], and [[Tad Lincoln|Tad]], and probably his [[Nancy Hanks Lincoln|mother]]. The "mole" on Lincoln's right cheek, the asymmetry of his face, his large jaw, his drooping eyelid, and "pseudo-depression" are also suggested as manifestations of MEN2B. MEN2B is a genetic disorder, and recently it has been demonstrated that Lincoln's biological mother, [[Nancy Hanks Lincoln]], had many of the same unusual facial features as her son, as well as a marfanoid [[body habitus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sotos JG |title=Abraham Lincoln's marfanoid mother: the earliest known case of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B? |journal=Clinical Dysmorphology |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=131–136 |year=2012 |pmid= 22504423 |doi=10.1097/MCD.0b013e328353ae0c}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lincoln's longevity is the principal challenge to the MEN2B hypothesis: Lincoln lived long enough to be assassinated at age 56, while untreated MEN2B is generally understood to result in death by the patient's mid-thirties. There are, however, several reported cases of MEN2B patients surviving into their 50s with no or little treatment.  The hypothesis could be proven by DNA testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Mental health==
Lincoln was contemporaneously described as suffering from "[[Melancholia|melancholy]]," a condition which modern mental health professionals would characterize as [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Atlantic |date=October 2005 |first=Joshua Wolf |last=Shenk |title=Lincoln's Great Depression |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200510/lincolns-clinical-depression |accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during his time as an Illinois legislator that Joshua Speed said Lincoln anonymously published a suicide poem in the Sangamo Journal; though he was not sure of the date, a suicide poem was published on August 25, 1838, making Lincoln 29 years of age. The poem is called ''[[The Suicide's Soliloquy]];'' historians are still divided on whether or not Lincoln was the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether he may have suffered from depression as a genetic predilection, as a reaction to multiple emotional traumas in his life,&lt;ref&gt;During his life Lincoln experienced the death of multiple close family members, including his mother, his sister, close confidant [[Ann Rutledge]], and two of his sons, [[Edward Baker Lincoln|Eddie]] and [[William Wallace Lincoln|Willie]]. {{cite book |last=Warren |first=Louis Austin |page=175 |isbn=978-0-87195-063-5
 |year=1959 |location=Indianapolis |title=: Lincoln's Youth: Indiana Years: Seven to Twenty-One |publisher=Indiana Historical Society Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a combination thereof is the subject of much current conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald]], p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln suffered depressed mood after major traumatic events, such as the death of [[Ann Rutledge]] in August 1835,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald]], p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; the cessation of his (purported) engagement to [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] in January 1841 (after which several close associates feared Lincoln's suicide),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald]], p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; and after the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald]], p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not clear that any of these episodes meet modern medical criteria for depression.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos|Sotos, "Physical Lincoln"]]. pages 220-233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Lincoln felt her husband to be too trusting, and his melancholy tended to strike at times he was betrayed or unsupported by those in whom he put faith.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schreiner|Schreiner]], p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln would often combat his melancholic moods by delving into works of humor, likely a healthy coping mechanism for his depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joshua Wolf |last=Shenk |title=Lincoln's Melancholy: How Depression Challenged a President and Fueled His Greatness |origyear=2005 |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-618-77344-2 |page=116 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that Lincoln took "[[blue mass]]" pills to improve his mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Medication==

The recollections of Lincoln's legal colleagues (John Stuart, Henry Whitney, Ward Lamon, and William Herndon) all agree that Lincoln took blue mass pills because of [[constipation]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos2|"Sourcebook"]]. paragraphs 612-626.&lt;/ref&gt; (constipation is a troubling symptom in multiple endocrine neoplasia Type 2B, described above).  The active ingredient of blue mass is elemental [[mercury (element)|mercury]] – a substance now known to be a neurotoxin in its vaporic state.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hayden|Hayden]], p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether [[mercury poisoning]] may have affected Lincoln's demeanor before or after he ceased its use in 1861 is unknown, but still remains the subject of conjecture by some historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/07/0717_lincoln.html |title=Did Mercury in 'Little Blue Pills' Make Abraham Lincoln Erratic? |last=Mayell |first=Hillary |publisher=National Geographic News |date=July 17, 2001 |accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's only known assessments of the medication are that it made him "cross" but that he preferred it above others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://durer.press.illinois.edu/wilson/html/632.html |title=Herndon's Informants |last=Wilson |first=DL |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1998 |accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865, speaking with the Washington correspondent of the [[Pittsburgh Chronicle]], Mrs. Lincoln described an instance in which her husband's "usual medicine," the mercury based "blue pills" made him terribly ill.   The correspondent recorded the interview as follows: Mrs. Lincoln "recalled the fact that her husband had been very ill, for several days, from the effects of a dose of blue pills taken shortly before his second inauguration."  She said he was not well, and appearing to require his usual medicine, blue pills, she sent to the drug store in which Harrold was employed last and got a dose and gave them to him at night before going to bed, and that next morning his pallor terrified her.  'His face,' said she, pointing to the bed beside which she sat, 'was white as that pillow-case, as it lay just there,' she exclaimed, laying her hand on the pillow—'white, and such a deadly white; as he tried to rise he sank back again quite overcome!'  She described his anxiety to be up, there was so much to do, and her persistence and his oppressive languor in keeping him in bed for several days; said he and she both thought it so strange that the pills should affect him in that way; they had never done so before, and both concluded they would get no more medicine there, as the attendant evidently did not understand making up prescriptions."&lt;ref&gt;California Digital Newspaper Collection – Late Atlantic Intelligence, Sacramento Daily Union, Volume 29, Number 4497, 21 August 1865&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermann Philipp Rudolf Stieve''' (22 May 1886 – 5 September 1952) was a German physician, [[human anatomy|anatomist]] and [[histology|histologist]]. Following his medical studies, he served in the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] during [[World War I|First World War]] and became interested in the effect of stress and other environmental factors on the [[Human female reproductive system|female reproductive system]], the subject of his later research. In 1921 he became the youngest doctor to chair the medical department of a German university.&lt;ref name="Slate article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bazelon |first=Emily |authorlink=Emily Bazelon |title=The Nazi Anatomists |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/history/2013/11/nazi_anatomy_history_the_origins_of_conservatives_anti_abortion_claims_that.html |newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]] |date=6 November 2013 |accessdate=6 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906063332/http://www.slate.com/articles/life/history/2013/11/nazi_anatomy_history_the_origins_of_conservatives_anti_abortion_claims_that.html |archivedate=September 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught medicine at the [[University of Berlin]], and was Director of the [[Center for Anatomy of the Charité|Berlin Institute of Anatomy]] at the [[Charité]] teaching hospital in the later years of his life.&lt;ref name=BMJ96&gt;{{cite journal|author=Seidelmen, William E.|date=7 Dec 1996| journal= British Medical Journal|title=Nuremberg lamentation: For the forgotten victims of medical science| volume=313|pages=1463–67|pmc=2352986|pmid=8973236|issue=7070|doi=10.1136/bmj.313.7070.1463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Stieve's research was conducted during the 1930s, after the [[Nazi Party]] had come to power in Germany. He did not join the party himself, but as an ardent [[German nationalism|German nationalist]] supported [[Adolf Hitler]] in the hope of restoring national pride. The Nazis imprisoned and executed many of their political opponents, and their corpses became Stieve's primary research material, with his full awareness of their origin. While much of his work is still considered valuable—among other things, he provided scientific evidence that the [[rhythm method]] was not effective in preventing pregnancy—it is considered tainted by his effective collaboration with the Nazi regime's political repression, especially in light of its later [[genocide]]s.&lt;ref name=BMJ96/&gt;&lt;ref name=CA09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winkelmann|first=Andreas|authorlink=|author2=Schagen Udo|date=Mar 2009|title=Hermann Stieve's clinical-anatomical research on executed women during the "Third Reich"|journal=[[Clinical Anatomy]]|volume=22|issue=2|pages=163–71|publisher= |location = [[United States]]| issn = | pmid = 19173259|doi = 10.1002/ca.20760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Born to a [[Protestant]] family in Munich in 1886, the son of historian [[Felix Stieve]]&lt;ref name="German Stieve obit"&gt;{{cite web|last=Romeis|first=Benno|title=Hermann Stieve 22.5.1886 – 6.9.1952|url=http://www.badw.de/publikationen/sonstige/nachrufe/1953/Stieve.pdf|publisher=[[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]|language=German|date=1953|accessdate=October 8, 2014|quote=Sein Vater, Felix Stieve, war o. Professor der Geschichte an der Technischen Hochschule in München und seit 1878 o. Mitglied der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[:sv:Felix Stieve]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the younger brother of later German diplomat [[Friedrich Stieve|Friedrich]]&lt;ref&gt;See also [[:sv:Friedrich Stieve]]&lt;/ref&gt; and elder brother of later German social worker [[Hedwig Stieve|Hedwig]], Stieve graduated from that city's [[Wilhelmsgymnasium (Munich)|Wilhelmsgymnasium]] in 1905. After a [[medical intern]]ship at [[Rechts der Isar Hospital]], medical studies at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] and the [[University of Innsbruck]] in nearby [[Austria]] and a year's service in the military, he became a physician in 1912. He worked in anatomical research for a year before the [[World War I|First World War]] began in 1914.&lt;ref name="Romeis bio"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romeis |first=B|date=Aug 1953|title=Hermann Stieve.|journal=[[Anatomischer Anzeiger]]|volume=99|issue=23–24|pages=401–40|publisher= |location = | issn = 0003-2786| pmid = 13105004
| bibcode = | oclc =| id = | url = | language =German | accessdate = | laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stieve returned to the Army, where he both tended to patients at the front and taught at the military medical school in Munich. His service was recognized with several awards. After the war he [[habilitation|habilitated]], writing a paper on the development of the [[Western Jackdaw|jackdaw]]'s [[ovary]]. He took a [[chair (academic)|chair]] as a [[lecturer]] and researcher in [[human anatomy|anatomy]] and [[anthropology]] at the [[University of Leipzig]]. There he was known for giving his lectures in a black [[academic dress|academic robe]].&lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt;

==Academic career and political activity==

Like many German war veterans, Stieve was dissatisfied with the [[Weimar Republic]] and its attempt at a democratic government. He was also a [[German nationalism|German nationalist]], supporting a drive to replace words of non-German origin in the German language, such as ''April'' and ''Mai'' for those months, with words of German origin. These political beliefs led him into many right-wing political and paramilitary organizations of the time, forerunners of the [[Nazi Party]].&lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt;

He joined the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP) shortly after taking his position at Leipzig, and later the local [[Freikorps]]. He also joined the [[Georg Escherich|Orgesch]], a paramilitary organization that was ordered disbanded by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in 1921 as a violation of the provisions of [[Treaty of Versailles]] that limited German rearmament. Later that year Stieve supported the [[Kapp Putsch]], a failed [[military coup]] that briefly forced the republic's civilian government to flee Berlin.&lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt;

Shortly afterwards, he received his doctorate and was appointed a professor of anatomy at [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg]]. He was also made director of the university's anatomical institute, making Stieve, then 35, the youngest doctor ever to chair a medical department at a German university.&lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt;

That same year, he joined another paramilitary organization, the [[Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Stahlhelm]], which primarily served as the DNVP's armed wing, ostensibly providing security at its meetings. For the next five years his academic responsibilities included chairing the German University Committee for Physical Education. Over that time, the militarist elements of the German body politic with which Stieve was involved became stronger, and more openly antidemocratic.&lt;ref name="Romeis bio" /&gt;

In 1933, as the Nazi government [[Gleichschaltung|consolidated its power]], he was elected rector of the university council. The university was for a time renamed, either at Stieve's initiative or due to a conflict with the university chapter of the [[National Socialist German Students' League]]. Like many German academics, Stieve did not protest when the Nazis dismissed Jews from the faculty. However, despite welcoming [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rule as a restoration of national pride, he did not join the Nazi party,&lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt; one of the few German medical school administrators who did not do so. Stieve also was a nationalist in the language theme as he supported an intention of replacing English-source words like April and Mai with Germanic equivalents.&lt;ref name="Charité UB website"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Berlin Anatomy 1935 - 1945|url=http://anatomie.charite.de/en/history/1935_1945/|publisher=Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin|year=2013|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; He did become a member of a party organization passively, when the remaining Stahlhelm were merged into the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] reserve in 1934.&lt;ref name="Romeis bio" /&gt;

==Medical research==

Building on his doctoral dissertation, Stieve had continued with his research on ovaries and the female reproductive system. He was particularly interested in how stress affected fertility. In one experiment he put a caged fox near hens to see if they would lay eggs; in another he induced similar stress in female [[newt]]s.&lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt;

Ultimately he wanted to study human organs. He was able to get some donated uteruses and ovaries from the bodies of accident victims, or from surgeons who'd [[hysterectomy|removed them]]. However, one of the best historical sources of organs for research, the bodies of executed criminals, had not been available during the early years of his research as the Weimar government made very minimal use of [[Capital punishment in Germany|the death penalty]], and did not execute any women.&lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt; In a 1931 letter Stieve complained that it was difficult to get a set of ovaries from a healthy woman.&lt;ref name="Romeis bio" /&gt;
[[File:Jsa ploetzensee torhaus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Plötzensee Prison]], where Stieve obtained bodies daily|alt=An ornate brick building with round arched barred windows, one story high except for a two-story high central entrance pavilion with a pointed roof. There are some tall shade trees behind it.]]
By 1934, the Nazis were arresting many real and perceived opponents. All were imprisoned; enough were executed that there was no longer a shortage of bodies for researchers to use. "The execution chambers of jails throughout the [[Third Reich]] were virtual slaughterhouses, and the remains were delivered to every university institute of anatomy in Germany (and probably Austria)," writes [[University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine|University of Toronto]] medical historian William Seidelman.&lt;ref name="Seidelman article"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seidelman|first=William|title=On Science: Medicine and Murder in the Third Reich|journal=Dimensions|year=1999|volume=13|issue=1|url=http://archive.adl.org/braun/dim_medicine_murder.asp|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stieve, who had accepted a professorship at what is now [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] as well as the directorship of its anatomical institute, reached an agreement with administrators at [[Plötzensee Prison]] outside the city to accept all bodies of those shot, hanged or beheaded, many of them [[political prisoner]]s. Others were "Polish and Russian slave laborers executed for such acts as socializing with German women," according to Seidelman.&lt;ref name="Seidelman article" /&gt; Over the entire Nazi era that came to around 3,000 victims, many more bodies than Stieve needed for research purposes.&lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt; It is alleged that during his research he claimed the corpses of 182 victims of the Nazi regime, 174 of whom were women at the age rank from 18 to 68, two thirds of victims were of German origin.&lt;ref name="BBC story"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gill|first=Victoria|title=Victims of Nazi anatomists named|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21086388|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=27 January 2013|accessdate=November 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ahrp"&gt;[http://ahrp.org/nazi-anatomists-exploit-executions-dr-hermann-stieves-list/ Dr. Hermann Stieve] Retrieved on 1 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately from 12,000 to 16,000 of civilians were executed during the Nazi regime from 1933 to 1945 in Germany, they were sentenced to death for minor faults.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/life/history/2013/11/nazi_anatomy_history_the_origins_of_conservatives_anti_abortion_claims_that.html/  Dr. Stieve and “Legitimate Rape”] Retrieved on 1 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

For the female corpses he was particularly interested in, Stieve made use of the prison's detailed recordkeeping. He got [[medical history|histories]] that included information about how the women had reacted to their death sentences, how well they had adjusted to prison life, and the timing of their [[menstrual cycle]]s. Based on this information he wrote 230 papers on the effect of stress on the female reproductive system. Women facing execution [[ovulation|ovulated]] less predictably, he found, and sometimes experienced what he called "shock bleedings". One paper argued that the [[Calendar-based contraceptive methods#Knaus–Ogino or rhythm method|Knaus–Ogino rhythm method]] of contraception was ineffective due to the variations of the cycle. Despite Stieve's errors in understanding the [[physiology]], his conclusion is still accepted as correct.&lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt;

Since he took care of all the prison's bodies, he had some influence with officials there. In 1942 they changed schedules so that executions took place at night; Stieve was able to persuade them to return to mornings so that he could process the bodies and tissue the same day. Claims that his influence went so far as to choosing the women's execution dates based on their cycles have been debunked,&lt;ref name=CA09/&gt; and other reports that he allowed [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officers to rape some prisoners in order to study sperm migration have not been substantiated and appear dubious (none of Stieve's papers mention sperm as a subject of inquiry); although Seidelman, who first reported this, insists it occurred. Nor, contrary to another report, did Stieve make soap from the remains of the bodies after they had been dissected.&lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt;
[[File:CIC RO L Berkowitz detail.jpg|thumb | [[Liane Berkowitz]]]]
Among those who went to his lab tables following their death were some of the more notable members of the limited [[German Resistance to Nazism|German resistance]] of the Nazi era. The bodies of [[Harro Schulze-Boysen]] and his wife [[Libertas Schulze-Boysen|Libertas]], along with [[Arvid Harnack]] and [[Liane Berkowitz]], all members of the [[Red Orchestra (espionage)|Red Orchestra]], which tried to thwart [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany's invasion of the U.S.S.R.]] in 1941, were taken there after their executions near the end of 1942. The next year the body of [[Elfriede Scholz]], sister of novelist [[Erich Maria Remarque]], was also released to Stieve after her execution for "undermining morale" after saying that the war was lost.&lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt; Stieve’s list of his research files was obtained 70 years later and as of 2018 these documents are held in ''Memorial Site for the German Resistance'' in Berlin.&lt;ref name="ahrp"/&gt;
[[File:Harnak Mildred.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mildred Fish Harnack]], executed for espionage in 1943. Her body is the only one of the 182 Stieve used for research whose burial location is known|alt=A grainy black-and-white photograph of a woman with hair tightly drawn about her hair wearing a shirt with a high collar and buttons]]
Harnack's [[Wisconsin]]-born wife [[Mildred Fish Harnack|Mildred]] originally seemed to escape this fate when she received a six-year sentence for her espionage activities. It was overturned on Hitler's direct order, to be replaced with beheading, making her the only American woman Hitler personally ordered executed.&lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt; Another one of Stieve's students carried her remains home in a shopping bag and had them buried in [[Zehlendorf (Berlin)|Zehlendorf]] Cemetery, making her the only member of the Red Orchestra whose burial site is known.&lt;ref name="Slate followup article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bazelon|first=Emily|title=What Happened to the Remains of Nazi Resister Mildred Harnack? Now We Know.|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/11/07/mildred_fish_harnack_was_executed_by_hitler_for_resisting_the_nazis_now.html|newspaper=Slate|date=7 November 2013|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the bodies of Harnack and the Schulze-Boysens were in the examining room, one of Libertas' friends, Charlotte Pommer, who had gone into medical studies, recognized them and quit the program on the spot, since she knew that Libertas wanted to be buried somewhere quiet and tranquil. Later Pommer became a dissident herself, hiding a family member of one those involved in the [[20 July plot|1944 assassination attempt on Hitler]] and eventually being jailed herself near the end of the war. She is the only one of Stieve's students or assistants known to have left the program for moral reasons. Stieve himself claimed to have refused the bodies of some of the assassination plotters—the only time he allegedly did so—but reportedly had no problem dissecting the body of [[Walter Arndt]], a longtime friend who was executed in 1944. Supposedly he kept Arndt's heart.&lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt;

==After the war==

When the war ended, both the occupying powers and the families of the deceased began trying to learn what had happened to the bodies of those executed. In many cases it was impossible, as documentation was unavailable and what bodies and samples remained were rarely identifiable. The identities of those Stieve did his research on only became known almost 70 years after the war when a list he had compiled in 1946 for a Protestant minister trying to help some of the relatives of Plötzensee inmates find their remains.&lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt; They were published in a medical journal by another researcher, Sabine Hildebrandt.&lt;ref name="BBC story" /&gt;

Like many German doctors who had been in some way complicit with the Nazi regime's [[crimes against humanity]], Stieve was never held accountable. After the [[Doctors' Trial]] at Nuremberg in 1946 led to convictions of 14 physicians who had conducted experiments on unwilling living subjects in concentration camps, the country's medical profession looked within itself to see who else among its members had also committed war crimes. In 1948 it was announced that only several hundred of the country's thousands of physicians had done so, a number that excluded Stieve and many of his fellow anatomists who did their work at universities rather than camps. The profession was worried about the possible loss of teaching physicians to Germany if all who had accepted bodies of the executed for research were imprisoned or otherwise disqualified from practicing or teaching.&lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt;

He did defend his work on one occasion. "[An anatomist] only tries to retrieve results from those incidents that belong to the saddest experiences known in the history of mankind," he said. "In no way do I need to be ashamed of the fact that I was able to reveal new data from the bodies of the executed, facts that were unknown before and are now recognized by the whole world." He denied, however, that the executed victims he had done his research on were political prisoners.&lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt; After his death the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] acknowledged the criticism of Stieve's work in the obituary it published in its yearbook. It felt compelled to put to rest "spiteful false accusations" by pointing out that Stieve had never set foot in a concentration camp, nor had he made any request to the prison administration that "this or that should happen" before the execution. The bodies he dissected, it claimed, were either victims of accidents or common criminals lawfully sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="Romeis Stieve defense"&gt;"Romeis, "Von gegnerischer Seite wurde die reine Forschertätigkeit Stieves mit den Wahnsinnstaten der Konzentrationslager in Verbindung gebracht. Stieve litt sehr unter diesen gehässigen unwahren Anschuldigungen. Deshalb sei betont, daß Stieve niemals ein
Konzentrationslager betreten hat. Er hat niemals Wünsche geäußert, daß mit den Opfern dies er Lager vor der Hinrichtung dieses oder jenes geschehen solle. Die Leichen, die er in die Anatomie bekam und an denen er seine Untersuchungen ausführte, waren Leichen von Unglücksfällen
oder von Menschen, die wegen gemeiner Verbrechen außerhalb der Lager von regulären Gerichten zum Tode verurteilt waren"&lt;/ref&gt; He never stopped to manage his university’s Institute of Anatomy and only his death broke his work in 1952. Despite of their being involved in different war crimes half of Germany’s doctors who were the members of the Nazi Party continued practicing after the war.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;

For his work, he was elected to the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin]] and the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]]. The [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] also extended membership to him. The hospital erected a bust of Stieve and named a lecture hall after him.&lt;ref name=BMJ96/&gt; He died from a stroke in 1952 while serving as the institute's director. He had wanted to leave his own body to science, but after his wife objected he was buried.&lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt;

==Legacy==

Stieve's work continues to be both scientifically important and controversial, as its full circumstances become known. On his centennial in 1986, he was praised as "a great anatomist who revolutionised the basis of [[gynaecology]] through his clinical-anatomical research."&lt;ref name="Charité UB website" /&gt; In a 2009 review, German medical historians Andreas Winkelmann and Udo Schagen conclude that "Stieve was neither a murderer nor a fervent Nazi. Nevertheless, his research results were flawed by their ethical and political context."&lt;ref name=CA09/&gt;

Stieve's research, although not in a form directly attributed to him, was the basis of [[Rape and pregnancy controversies in United States elections, 2012|a controversy]] over [[rape and pregnancy]] during the [[United States Senate elections, 2012|2012 U.S. Senate elections]]. In [[United States Senate election in Missouri, 2012|Missouri]], Rep. [[Todd Akin]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate, justified his opposition to allowing women impregnated during rapes to have abortions, asserted that in cases of "legitimate rape" the stress would make [[Fertilisation|conception]] unlikely. The basis for the claim was a 1972 book by antiabortion activist [[Fred Mecklenburg]], which cited a purported Nazi experiment in which women put under traumatic stress did not [[ovulation|ovulate]]. Hildebrandt recognized this as apparently an imperfect understanding of Stieve's findings.&lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1413">A '''localized disease''' is an [[infection|infectious]] or [[neoplastic]] process that originates in and is confined to one [[organ system]] or general area in the body,&lt;ref&gt;Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary,28th edition. W.B.Saunders, Harcourt Brace &amp; Company&lt;/ref&gt; such as a [[sprain]]ed ankle, a [[boil]] on the hand, an [[abscess]] of finger.

A localized cancer that has not extended beyond the margins of the organ involved can also be described as localized disease, while cancers that extend into other tissues are described as invasive. Tumors that are non-hematologic in origin but extend into the bloodstream or lymphatic system are known as metastatic.

Localized diseases are contrasted with [[disseminated disease]]s and [[systemic disease]]s.  

Some diseases are capable of changing from local to disseminated diseases.  [[Pneumonia]], for example, is generally confined to one or both [[lungs]] but can become disseminated through [[sepsis]], in which the [[microbe]] responsible for the pneumonia "seeds" the [[bloodstream]] or [[lymphatic system]] and is transported to distant sites in the body. When that occurs, the process is no longer described as a localized disease, but rather as a disseminated disease.

==Early Life==
Louis Antoine was born in [[Mirecourt]]. He studied at the [[lycee]] in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]. His father was a director of a manufacturer of matchsticks. After this, he studied at the Collège de Compiègne. He was awarded the bacculareat in Latin and science in 1905 and the bacculareat in mathematics in 1906. He then attended [[École Normale Supérieure]]. Once he graduated, he became a mathematics teacher the Lycée de Dijon in Saint-Cyr. He married his wife, Marguerite Rouselle in 1918. After the declaration of [[World War I]], Antoine served as a reserve lieutenant in the 72nd Infantry Regiment of Amiens, and later a commander on the machine gun of the 151st Infantry Regiment. In 1917, he lost his sight as a result of bullets hitting his eyes&lt;ref name="St.AndrewsAntoine" /&gt;. After the loss of his vision, [[Henri Lebesgue]] suggested that Antoine study two- and three-dimensional [[topology]] as it could be studied without the use of his sight&lt;ref name="MathbookAntoine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMSAntoine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="St.AndrewsAntoine" /&gt;.

==Work==
In 1919, Antione began his doctorate in mathematics at the [[University of Strasbourg]]. Antione was assisted by his friends during his studies, who produced [[braille]] copies of mathematical papers. Antione developed a system of braille mathematical notation, with the assistance of a student at Ecole Normale Superieure. Antione discovered Antione’s necklace in 1921&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Antoine |first1=Louis |title=Sur l'homeomorphisme de deux figures et leurs voisinages |journal=Journal Math Pures et appl |date=1921 |issue=4 |pages=221–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He submitted his thesis in 1921. In 1922, Antione became an assistant lecturer at the Faculty of Sciences in [[Rennes]]. He subsequently became a professor of Pure Mathematics at Rennes in 1925&lt;ref name="St.AndrewsAntoine" /&gt;.

==Later Life and Death==
Antione began to experience heart disease in 1957. He subsequently retired from his professorship. He was elected to the [[Académie des Sciences]] in 1961. He died in 1971 after fracturing his neck&lt;ref name="St.AndrewsAntoine" /&gt;.

'''MDVIP''' is an American company, headquartered in [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]], [[Florida]], that operates a network of physicians.  The company's [[physician]]s practice [[preventive medicine]] and personalized [[Primary care|primary-care medicine]].

The national network consists of 900 physicians serving over 280,000 patients in 45 states and the District of Columbia. Each physician cares for up to 600 patients as opposed to the average 2,500-3,500 patients in a traditional primary-care practice. MDVIP patients receive a [[Physical examination|comprehensive physical examination]] and follow-up wellness plan as well as electronic medical records and a personalized patient portal with focus on diet, exercise, doctor communication and more. The company states that additional patient benefits include [[acute care|acute-care]] visits, same or next-day availability, on-time appointments, 24/7 physician availability, and enhanced coordination of specialty care.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mdvip.com/patients/benefits "MDVIP Patient Advantages"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in Boca Raton in 2000, in June 2014, growth-equity investor [[Summit Partners]] acquired the company from [[Procter &amp; Gamble Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/2/summit-partners-buys-mdvip-from-p-g-249552-1.html].&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, Leonard Green &amp; Partners acquired majority ownership. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mdvip.com/leonard-green-partners-acquires-majority-ownership-mdvip-summit-partners].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
To supplement insurance reimbursements, MDVIP physicians charge patients an annual fee between $1,650 and $2,200 per year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mdvip.com/patients/benefits].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this annual fee, patients are responsible for applicable co-pays and co-insurance, and maintain primary-care [[Health insurance|insurance]] coverage including [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20100818014513/http://www.mdvip.com/patient/insurancemedicare.aspx MDVIP Insurance and Medicare].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.boston.com/2011-04-17/business/29428534_1_concierge-medicine-mdvip-boutique-practices]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. [[Boston.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the [[Concierge medicine#Concierge medicine vs. direct primary care|direct-care model]], this revenue format, often referenced as [[concierge medicine]], runs the risk of audit or penalty as Medicare and other private-insurance carriers cover a comprehensive wellness exam currently listed as part of the MDVIP package.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarp.org/health/health-care-reform/info-07-2011/free-medicare-wellness-exam.html "What You Need to Know About the New, Free Medicare Checkup"]. [[AARP]].&lt;/ref&gt;

MDVIP physicians are not directly employed by the company, instead they pay a [[Royalties|royalty]] or [[Franchise fee|franchise]] fee of $500&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111108211623/http://www.journalwatchdog.com/business/932-a-different-kind-of-doctoring "A Different Kind of Doctoring].&lt;/ref&gt; per patient per year for services such as patient conversion, marketing, branding and other support.&lt;ref&gt;[https://forrestdirectpay.com/page/why-forrest-direct-pay "Forrest Direct Pay"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402224259/https://forrestdirectpay.com/page/why-forrest-direct-pay |date=April 2, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5921">[[File:MotorCart.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A motorized shopping cart in a supermarket]]
A '''motorized shopping cart''' (also known as '''electric shopping cart''') is a [[shopping cart]] equipped with an [[electric motor]] and navigational controls. It includes a seat (often equipped with an occupant seat switch activating movement of the motorized shopping cart from the occupant's weight) thereby also making it a [[motorized wheelchair]], and it has a [[rechargeable battery]] that can be charged by plugging in the device when not in use in order to maximize usage. Motorized shopping carts are provided by [[supermarket]]s and other large retail stores for those with permanent or temporary [[physical disability|physical disabilities]] who may have difficulty walking through a large store or pushing a regular cart.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lZcLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4FUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5571,1627728&amp;dq=electric+shopping+cart Mart Carts help benefit disabled persons], ''The Victoria Advocate'' - August 8, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6008640_ITM Electric shopping carts serve growing number of consumers.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SfYHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BDwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4379,5919080&amp;dq=electric+shopping+cart Electric shopping carts add convenience], ''Rome News-Tribune'' - April 15, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the customers who use motorized shopping carts are not full-time wheelchair users, but find shopping easier using the device since a regular cart may be harder to push, especially when filled with merchandise, and walking through a large store may be cumbersome for one who is able to walk only short distances on their own power.

==Issues==

===Theft===
While [[Shopping cart#Theft prevention|shopping cart theft]] has also been a costly matter for retailers, the higher cost of the motorized carts makes their theft a greater issue to the store, and thereby leads stores to establish policies prohibiting the carts from exiting stores, even though a disabled person may have the need to bring the cart all the way to their vehicle

In May 2009, a [[Florida]] man was charged with [[felony]] theft of a motorized cart due to its $2,500 value. He was caught not far from the store, riding the cart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.nbc4i.com/cmh/news/national/article/late-night_joyride_on_motorized_shopping_cart_lands_man_in_jail/15341/ Late-Night Joyride On Motorized Shopping Cart Lands Man In Jail] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130129204035/http://www2.nbc4i.com/cmh/news/national/article/late-night_joyride_on_motorized_shopping_cart_lands_man_in_jail/15341/ |date=2013-01-29 }}, May 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Had a non-electric cart been stolen, the theft would have been a [[misdemeanor]].

In the same month, two [[South Carolina]] men were charged with the theft of a cart, and likewise faced felony charges due to it being valued at over $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wyff4.com/news/19438740/detail.html 2 Arrested In Shopping Cart Theft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614232124/http://www.wyff4.com/news/19438740/detail.html |date=2009-06-14 }}, May 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Such thefts are rare and difficult to sustain as the carts are obviously grocery store carts, which are designed with a maximum speed of two miles per hour.  Most powered operated mobility devices, such as powerchairs and scooters, have an average maximum speed of 5 miles per hour, though many are faster.  The baskets and seats are of commercial strength and the wheels are much smaller than those of consumer mobility devices.

===Injuries===
There has been concern over the carts leading to injuries when used by those who do not know how to control them well. The injuries can occur to the user if they crash into an object with the cart, or to a person the user crashes into. To reduce the risk of injury, most carts have a back-up warning system similar to those found on trucks.  They also are programmed with a low maximum speed of up to two miles per hour.

In [[Louisiana]] in 2011, a lawsuit was filed by a woman who claimed injury while using a motorized shopping cart. The case was dismissed as the defendant filed a motion asserting that the accident and injuries were caused by the woman's own actions and she could not meet her burden of proof. The store manager immediately tested the cart after the claimed injury and further testing was done by the store mechanic and an engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.louisianapremisesliabilitylaw.com/2011/03/articles/retail-stores/plaintiff-lets-case-roll-away/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110925/http://www.louisianapremisesliabilitylaw.com/2011/03/articles/retail-stores/plaintiff-lets-case-roll-away/ |archivedate=2014-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Permission to use===
While these carts are generally reserved for the disabled, most stores will take one's word for being a disabled person and will not challenge one's need for a cart. But there have been cases reported in which a person with a non-visible disability has requested the use of a motorized cart, but has been denied the use by store employees who did not believe the customer had a disability.

There has also been concern over minors using the carts. In January 2009, a [[Wal-Mart]] store in [[Tennessee]] did not allow an 11-year-old girl with a broken leg to use a motorized cart, despite the fact that she had been allowed by other stores to use them.

'''Mr. Yuk''' is a trademarked graphic image, created by [[UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh]], and widely employed in the [[United States]] in labeling of substances that are [[poison]]ous if ingested.

==Overview==
[[File:Mr-yuck-psa.ogg|thumb|The 1970s Mr. Yuk Public Service Announcement]]
To help children learn to avoid ingesting poisons, Mr. Yuk was conceived by Richard Moriarty, a pediatrician and clinical professor of pediatrics at the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine]] who founded the Pittsburgh Poison Center and the National Poison Center Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegiemnh.org/programs/moriarty.html|title=Adult Programs|publisher=Carnegie Museum of Natural History|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moriarty felt that the traditional [[skull and crossbones (poison)|skull and crossbones]] representing poison was no longer appropriate for children; Congressman [[Bill Coyne]] later said that by the 1970s the symbol was "associated with swashbuckling pirates and buccaneers rather than with harmful substances."&lt;ref name=pitt/&gt; The [[Jolly Roger]] flag was used on breakfast cereals and chewing gum, and it was the insignia for Moriarty's local major league baseball team, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]].&lt;ref name="gazette"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=19730625&amp;id=b59RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LG0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2619,3394357&amp;hl=en|title=Yeech!  It's Mr. Yuk, He's Poison!|last=Fisher|first=Ken|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=June 25, 1973|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The design and color were chosen when Moriarty used focus groups of young children to determine which combination was the most unappealing. Possible expressions were "mad" (crossed eyes and intense expression), "dead" (a sunken mouth and Xs for eyes), and "sick" (a sour expression with the tongue sticking out).&lt;ref name="gazette"/&gt; Children were asked to rank the faces according to which they liked the best, along with the skull and crossbones, and the "sick" face was least popular.&lt;ref name="gazette"/&gt; The shade of fluorescent green that was chosen was christened "Yucky!" by a young child and gave the design its name.&lt;ref name=pitt&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/is-it-true-that-the-well-known-mr-yuk-sticker-was-created-right-here-in-pittsburgh/Content?oid=1336409|title=Is it true that the well-known "Mr. Yuk" sticker was created right here in Pittsburgh?|last=Potter|first=Chris|work=[[Pittsburgh City Paper]]|date=September 16, 2004|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Yuk was first introduced in Pittsburgh {{Years or months ago|1971}} in 1971,&lt;ref name=ykttsc&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&amp;dat=19750104&amp;id=QUcgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=E50EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7274,600836&amp;hl=en |title=Mr. Yuk doing 'disgusting' job|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=Tuscaloosa News|location=(Alabama)|agency=Associated Press|date=January 4, 1975|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over the next few years, Mr. Yuk stickers gained nationwide {{nowrap|usage.&lt;ref name=ykttsc/&gt;&lt;ref name=lmtidm75&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZrJfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BDMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5621%2C1536436 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho) |title='Mr. Yuk' poison label is new warning for children |date=March 7, 1975 |page=14A}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The stickers usually contain phone numbers of [[poison control center]]s that may give guidance if poisoning has occurred or is suspected. Usually, stickers may carry a national toll-free number (''1-800-222-1222'' in the United States). In some areas, local poison control centers and children's hospitals issue stickers with local numbers, under license. Such an example is in Pittsburgh, where the telephone number for the Poison Control Center is 681-6669.

A  [[public service announcement]] was also produced in the 1970s featuring a theme song.&lt;ref name=pitt/&gt;

==Effectiveness==
At least two peer-reviewed medical studies (Fergusson 1982, Vernberg 1984) have suggested that Mr. Yuk stickers do not effectively keep children away from potential poisons and may even attract children.&lt;ref&gt;Vernberg K, Culver-Dickinson P, Spyker DA. (1984). "The deterrent effect of poison-warning stickers". ''American Journal of Diseases of Children'' '''138''', 1018&amp;ndash;1020. {{PMID|6496418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Vernberg and colleagues note concerns for using the stickers to protect young children. Fergusson and colleagues state that "the method may be effective with older children or as an adjunct to an integrated poisoning prevention campaign".&lt;ref&gt;Fergusson DM, Horwood LJ, Beautrais AL, Shannon FT. (1982). "A controlled field trial of a poisoning prevention method". ''Pediatrics'' '''69''', 515&amp;ndash;520. {{PMID|7079005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To evaluate the effectiveness of six projected symbols (skull-and-crossbones, red stop sign, and four others), tests were conducted at day care centers. Children in the program rated Mr. Yuk as the most unappealing image. By contrast, children rated the skull-and-crossbones to be the most appealing.&lt;ref name="Washington Poison Center"&gt;[http://www.wapc.org/resources/mryuk.htm Washington Poison Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109100220/http://www.wapc.org/resources/mryuk.htm |date=2008-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mr. Ouch]] symbol, developed by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) to warn children about electrical hazards, has a similar design and strategy.

==Use restrictions==
Mr. Yuk and his graphic rendering are registered [[trademark]]s and [[service mark]]s of the [[UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh]], and the rendering itself is additionally protected by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Human Factors and Ergonomics|last=Rice|first=J. Berg|editor-last=Salvendy|editor-first=Gavriel|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2012|isbn=9780470528389|page=1479|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q_ridhM7K7YC&amp;pg=PA1479}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the name and graphic image cannot be used without a license from the owner&amp;mdash;unlike the skull and crossbones symbol, which is in the [[public domain]].

The Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC gives out free sheets of Mr. Yuk stickers if contacted by mail.&lt;ref&gt;http://chp.edu/CHP/mryuk&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Yuk materials can also be ordered online from the University of Pittsburgh.

==In popular culture ==
{{in popular culture|date=February 2017}}
* Mr. Yuk has taken on a cult status throughout the city of Pittsburgh among older residents; the best example is the [[ultimate (sport)|Ultimate Frisbee]] team at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], which affectionately goes by "Mr. Yuk" and uses a variety of discs adorned with the classic logo.&lt;ref name='Mr. Yuk // Carnegie Mellon Ultimate'&gt;[http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ultimate/yuk/] Website for CMU men's ultimate team]&lt;/ref&gt;
* An image of Mr. Yuk is featured in the video game ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'' inside the lens cap of the [[Walther WA 2000]] sniper rifle, as well as the [[Barrett M82]] sniper rifle, where the sticker is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. It also appears as the image for receiving "bad" accolades.
* A Mr. Yuk sticker appears on a batch of reject retro-mutagen which Michelangelo rubs on in the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' episode "Mikey Gets Shellacne".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4639">The '''National Public Toilet Map''' is part of the [[Australia]]n government's [[National Continence Management Strategy]] (NCMS). The map allows more Australians with [[urinary incontinence|urinary]] and [[fecal incontinence]] problems to live and participate in their communities with dignity and confidence, by making it easier for them to find information about the location of public [[toilet]]s {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}.

The map was launched in September 2001.&lt;ref name="mediarelease"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2001 | url = http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-mediarel-yr2001-bb-bb01080.htm | title = Minister puts public toilets on the map | work = Media release and speech archive | publisher = Australian Government: Department of Health and Aged Care | accessdate = 2008-08-29 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.fo/20121126224046/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-mediarel-yr2001-bb-bb01080.htm | archivedate = 2012-11-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The map is internet based and can be accessed via a web browser or a free [[iOS]] app. It identifies more than 19,000 public and private toilets across Australia, including those in service stations and fast food outlets. The digital map also provides information on [[accessibility]] (access for disabled people) and opening hours for most of the toilets identified.

More than 3.8 million Australians are estimated to suffer continence issues, including families with young children.&lt;ref name="aboutmap"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.toiletmap.gov.au/staticpage.aspx?page=about | title = About the National Toilet Map | work = The National Toilet Map | publisher = Australian Government: Department of Health and Ageing | accessdate = 2006-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This represents 18% of the [[Demographics of Australia#Population|Australian population]].

The map allows journey planning, including finding toilets near points of interest.  Regular users of the web site can register and create their own customised [[web page]], ''My Toilet Map'', saving details of trips and localities for future reference.  Registered users can also download toilets as waypoints to a [[Global Positioning System|Global Positioning System (GPS)]] device.

For journey planning a detailed map and written instructions are provided.  Clickable [[ISO 7001|icons]] go to details of the toilets including [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] to four decimal places, who provides the toilet and when details were last checked as well as all facilities, for example [[wheelchair]] access, opening hours, or whether the toilet has a Master [[Locksmithing|Locksmiths']] Association Key (MLAK). The MLAK is a [[Key (lock)#Master key|master key]] that fits into specially designed locks allowing 24-hour-a-day access to public toilets. Eligible people, for example those with a disability, can purchase a key that opens all accessible toilets displaying the MLAK symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://home.vicnet.net.au/~wheelies/MLAK_FAQs.pdf | title = MLAK Frequently Asked Questions | format = pdf | publisher = The Wheelie's Handbook of Australia | accessdate = 2006-04-14 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111519/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~wheelies/MLAK_FAQs.pdf | archivedate = 2007-09-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The symbols used comply with [[ISO 7001]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year = 2006 | url = http://www.toiletmap.gov.au/staticpage.aspx?page=legend | title = Symbols | work = The National Toilet Map | publisher = Australian Government: Department of Health and Ageing | accessdate = 2006-04-15

'''''New Mobility''''', launched in 1989, is a United States-based magazine for active [[wheelchair]] users. This monthly publication covers health, disability rights, adaptive technology and lifestyle topics such as recreation, travel, the arts, relationships, sexuality, parenting, employment and home modification. It also profiles successful wheelchair users, including [[John Hockenberry]], [[Christopher Voelker]], [[Brooke Ellison]], [[Chantal Petitclerc]] and the late [[Christopher Reeve]]. ''New Mobility'', currently edited by Tim Gilmer, received an Utne Independent Press Award for Lifestyle Coverage in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utne.com/2007-01-01/LifestyleCoverage.aspx Utne Reader Independent Press Awards 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''New Mobility'' was founded in Boulder, Colorado, by Sam Maddox to provide information about life after spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, post-polio sequelae and other disabling conditions. Originally titled, ''Spinal Network Extra'', the then-quarterly magazine was a spin-off of the 1987 book ''Spinal Network: The Total Resource for the Wheelchair Community.''

Maddox edited ''New Mobility'' until 1991, when Barry Corbet, a paraplegic from a spinal cord injury, took the helm. The title was changed to ''New Mobility'' for the Summer 1992 issue. In 1993, the magazine temporarily ceased publication. Miramar Publishing (later Miramar Communications) bought the title and relaunched it in 1994. It became bimonthly in 1995 and monthly in 1996. In 1998, No Limits Communications acquired the magazine. In 2000, Corbet retired, and Gilmer, also paraplegic, began his tenure. In 2010, [[United Spinal Association]] bought ''New Mobility'' and continues to publish it monthly.

==The Niche==
Early disability titles tended to reflect what is known as the [[medical model of disability]], which emphasized the need for cures and referred to people with disabilities as "patients." ''New Mobility'' defined its [[social model of disability]] point of view with a lifestyle-oriented approach, [[Inclusion (disability rights)|inclusion]] mentality and [[people-first language]]. It was also one of the first periodicals to seriously address [[sexuality and disability]], and its provocative role in this area has been recognized by the ''Los Angeles Times,''&lt;ref&gt;[http://barrycorbet.com/john-young-lecture.html John Young Lecture by Barry Corbet]&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently the Associated Press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/040397/fea_disabled.html Sex and the Disabled: Still a Taboo Topic]&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine sums up its place in the field of disability journalism with the tagline "Life Beyond Wheels."

In children, a healthy weight varies with age and sex. Obesity in children and adolescents is defined not as an absolute number but in relation to a historical normal group, such that obesity is a BMI greater than the 95th&amp;nbsp;[[percentile]].&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/childrens_BMI/about_childrens_BMI.htm |title=Healthy Weight: Assessing Your Weight: BMI: About BMI for Children and Teens |publisher=[[Center for disease control and prevention]] |access-date=6 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reference data on which these percentiles were based date from 1963 to 1994, and thus have not been affected by the recent increases in weight.&lt;ref name="Flegal KM, Ogden CL, Wei R, Kuczmarski RL, Johnson CL 2001 1086–93"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flegal KM, Ogden CL, Wei R, Kuczmarski RL, Johnson CL | title = Prevalence of overweight in US children: comparison of US growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with other reference values for body mass index | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 73 | issue = 6 | pages = 1086–93 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11382664 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/73.6.1086 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BMI is defined as the subject's weight divided by the square of their height and is calculated as follows.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BMI}= \frac{m}{h^2}&lt;/math&gt;,

:where ''m'' and ''h'' are the subject's weight and height respectively.

BMI is usually expressed in kilograms of weight per metre squared of height. To convert from pounds per inch squared multiply by {{nowrap|703 (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)/(lb/sq in)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{nowrap|1 (lb/sq in)}} is more precisely {{nowrap|703.06957964 (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly used definitions, established by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in 1997 and published in 2000, provide the values listed in the table.&lt;ref name="WHO 2000 p.9"&gt;WHO 2000 p.9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nikcevic|first1=Ana V.|last2=Kuczmierczyk|first2=Andrzej R.|last3=Bruch|first3=Michael | name-list-format = vanc | title = Formulation and Treatment in Clinical Health Psychology|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135452087|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=apCNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morbidity===
{{Main|Obesity-associated morbidity}}
Obesity increases the risk of many physical and mental conditions. These comorbidities are most commonly shown in [[metabolic syndrome]],&lt;ref name=HaslamJames/&gt;  a combination of medical disorders which includes: [[diabetes mellitus type 2]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[hypercholesterolemia|high blood cholesterol]], and [[hypertriglyceridemia|high triglyceride levels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grundy SM | title = Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 89 | issue = 6 | pages = 2595–600 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15181029 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2004-0372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complications are either directly caused by obesity or indirectly related through mechanisms sharing a common cause such as a poor diet or a [[sedentary lifestyle]]. The strength of the link between obesity and specific conditions varies. One of the strongest is the link with [[type 2 diabetes]]. Excess body fat underlies 64% of cases of diabetes in men and 77% of cases in women.&lt;ref&gt;Seidell 2005 p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

Health consequences fall into two broad categories: those attributable to the effects of increased fat mass (such as [[osteoarthritis]], [[obstructive sleep apnea]], social stigmatization) and those due to the increased number of [[fat cells]] ([[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[cancer]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]]).&lt;ref name=HaslamJames/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bray2004&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bray GA | title = Medical consequences of obesity | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 89 | issue = 6 | pages = 2583–9 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15181027 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2004-0535 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increases in body fat alter the body's response to insulin, potentially leading to [[insulin resistance]].

===Survival paradox===
{{See also|Obesity paradox}}
Although the negative health consequences of obesity in the general population are well supported by the available evidence, health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to be improved at an increased BMI, a phenomenon known as the obesity survival paradox.&lt;ref name=Schmidt2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt DS, Salahudeen AK | title = Obesity-survival paradox-still a controversy? | journal = Seminars in Dialysis | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 486–92 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17991192 | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-139X.2007.00349.x | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox was first described in 1999 in overweight and obese people undergoing hemodialysis,&lt;ref name=Schmidt2007/&gt; and has subsequently been found in those with [[heart failure]] and [[Peripheral vascular disease|peripheral artery disease]] (PAD).&lt;ref name=paradox2003&gt;{{cite journal |author=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force |title=Behavioral counseling in primary care to promote a healthy diet: recommendations and rationale |journal=American Family Physician |volume=67 |issue=12 |pages=2573–6 |date=June 2003 |pmid=12825847 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
At an individual level, a combination of excessive [[food energy]] intake and a lack of [[physical activity]] is thought to explain most cases of obesity.&lt;ref name=CADG2006/&gt; A limited number of cases are due primarily to genetics, medical reasons, or psychiatric illness.&lt;ref name=Ble2008/&gt; In contrast, increasing rates of obesity at a societal level are felt to be due to an easily accessible and palatable diet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drewnowski A, Specter SE | title = Poverty and obesity: the role of energy density and energy costs | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–16 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14684391 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/79.1.6 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; increased [[Effects of the car on societies|reliance on cars]], and mechanized manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nestle M, Jacobson MF | title = Halting the obesity epidemic: a public health policy approach | journal = Public Health Reports | volume = 115 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–24 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10968581 | pmc = 1308552 | doi = 10.1093/phr/115.1.12 | type = Research Support }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=James2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = James WP | title = The fundamental drivers of the obesity epidemic | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 9 Suppl 1 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 6–13 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18307693 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00432.x | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 review identified ten other possible contributors to the recent increase of obesity: (1) [[sleep debt|insufficient sleep]], (2) [[endocrine disruptor]]s (environmental [[pollutant]]s that interfere with lipid metabolism), (3) decreased variability in ambient temperature, (4) decreased rates of [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], because smoking suppresses appetite, (5) increased use of medications that can cause weight gain (e.g., [[atypical antipsychotics]]), (6) proportional increases in ethnic and age groups that tend to be heavier, (7) pregnancy at a later age (which may cause susceptibility to obesity in children), (8) [[epigenetic]] risk factors passed on generationally, (9) [[natural selection]] for higher BMI, and (10) [[assortative mating]] leading to increased concentration of obesity risk factors (this would  increase the number of obese people by increasing population variance in weight).&lt;ref name="pmid16801930"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keith SW, Redden DT, Katzmarzyk PT, Boggiano MM, Hanlon EC, Benca RM, Ruden D, Pietrobelli A, Barger JL, Fontaine KR, Wang C, Aronne LJ, Wright SM, Baskin M, Dhurandhar NV, Lijoi MC, Grilo CM, DeLuca M, Westfall AO, Allison DB | title = Putative contributors to the secular increase in obesity: exploring the roads less traveled | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 30 | issue = 11 | pages = 1585–94 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 16801930 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ijo.0803326 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is evidence supporting the influence of these mechanisms on the increased prevalence of obesity, the evidence is still inconclusive, and the authors state that these are probably less influential than the ones discussed in the previous paragraph.

The [[thrifty gene hypothesis]] postulates that, due to dietary scarcity during human evolution, people are prone to obesity. Their ability to take advantage of rare periods of abundance by storing energy as fat would be advantageous during times of varying food availability, and individuals with greater adipose reserves would be more likely to survive [[famine]]. This tendency to store fat, however, would be maladaptive in societies with stable food supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chakravarthy MV, Booth FW | title = Eating, exercise, and "thrifty" genotypes: connecting the dots toward an evolutionary understanding of modern chronic diseases | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–10 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14660491 | doi = 10.1152/japplphysiol.00757.2003 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has received various criticisms, and other evolutionarily-based theories such as the [[drifty gene hypothesis]] and the [[thrifty phenotype|thrifty phenotype hypothesis]] have also been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wells JC | title = Thrift: a guide to thrifty genes, thrifty phenotypes and thrifty norms | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 33 | issue = 12 | pages = 1331–8 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19752875 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/ijo.2009.175 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wells JC | title = The thrifty phenotype: An adaptation in growth or metabolism? | journal = American Journal of Human Biology | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–75 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21082685 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/ajhb.21100 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other illnesses===
Certain physical and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk of obesity. Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) as well as some congenital or acquired conditions: [[hypothyroidism]], [[Cushing's syndrome]], [[growth hormone deficiency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosén T, Bosaeus I, Tölli J, Lindstedt G, Bengtsson BA | title = Increased body fat mass and decreased extracellular fluid volume in adults with growth hormone deficiency | journal = Clinical Endocrinology | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–71 | date = January 1993 | pmid = 8435887 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2265.1993.tb00974.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[eating disorder]]s: [[binge eating disorder]] and [[night eating syndrome]].&lt;ref name=HaslamJames/&gt; However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IVR]] as a psychiatric illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zametkin AJ, Zoon CK, Klein HW, Munson S | title = Psychiatric aspects of child and adolescent obesity: a review of the past 10 years | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 134–50 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14726719 | doi = 10.1097/00004583-200402000-00008 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chiles C, van Wattum PJ |title=Psychiatric aspects of the obesity crisis |journal=Psychiatr Times |year=2010 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=47–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain medications may cause weight gain or changes in [[body composition]]; these include [[insulin]], [[sulfonylurea]]s, [[thiazolidinedione]]s, [[atypical antipsychotic]]s, [[antidepressant]]s, [[glucocorticoids|steroids]], certain [[anticonvulsant]]s ([[phenytoin]] and [[valproate]]), [[pizotifen]], and some forms of [[hormonal contraception]].&lt;ref name=HaslamJames/&gt;

===Social determinants===
{{Main|Social determinants of obesity}}
[[File:Yamai no Soshi - Obesity.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|The disease scroll (Yamai no soshi, late 12th century) depicts a woman moneylender with obesity, considered a disease of the rich.]]
While genetic influences are important to understanding obesity, they cannot explain the current dramatic increase seen within specific countries or globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yach D, Stuckler D, Brownell KD | title = Epidemiologic and economic consequences of the global epidemics of obesity and diabetes | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 62–6 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16397571 | doi = 10.1038/nm0106-62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is accepted that energy consumption in excess of energy expenditure leads to obesity on an individual basis, the cause of the shifts in these two factors on the societal scale is much debated. There are a number of theories as to the cause but most believe it is a combination of various factors.

The correlation between [[social class]] and BMI varies globally. A review in 1989 found that in developed countries women of a high social class were less likely to be obese. No significant differences were seen among men of different social classes. In the developing world, women, men, and children from high social classes had greater rates of obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sobal J, Stunkard AJ | title = Socioeconomic status and obesity: a review of the literature | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 105 | issue = 2 | pages = 260–75 | date = March 1989 | pmid = 2648443 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.105.2.260 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; An update of this review carried out in 2007 found the same relationships, but they were weaker. The decrease in strength of correlation was felt to be due to the effects of [[globalization]].&lt;ref name=McLaren2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McLaren L | title = Socioeconomic status and obesity | journal = Epidemiologic Reviews | volume = 29 | issue =  | pages = 29–48 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17478442 | doi = 10.1093/epirev/mxm001 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among developed countries, levels of adult obesity, and percentage of teenage children who are overweight, are correlated with [[economic inequality|income inequality]].  A similar relationship is seen among US states: more adults, even in higher social classes, are obese in more unequal states.&lt;ref name="spirit"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard G.

Many explanations have been put forth for associations between BMI and social class. It is thought that in developed countries, the wealthy are able to afford more nutritious food, they are under greater social pressure to remain slim, and have more opportunities along with greater expectations for [[physical fitness]]. In [[undeveloped countries]] the ability to afford food, high energy expenditure with physical labor, and cultural values favoring a larger body size are believed to contribute to the observed patterns.&lt;ref name=McLaren2007/&gt; Attitudes toward body weight held by people in one's life may also play a role in obesity. A correlation in BMI changes over time has been found among friends, siblings, and spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Christakis NA, Fowler JH | title = The spread of obesity in a large social network over 32 years | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 357 | issue = 4 | pages = 370–9 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17652652 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMsa066082 | type = Research Support | citeseerx = 10.1.1.581.4893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stress and perceived low social status appear to increase risk of obesity.&lt;ref name="spirit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Björntorp P | title = Do stress reactions cause abdominal obesity and comorbidities? | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 73–86 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 12119665 | doi = 10.1046/j.1467-789x.2001.00027.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodman E, Adler NE, Daniels SR, Morrison JA, Slap GB, Dolan LM | title = Impact of objective and subjective social status on obesity in a biracial cohort of adolescents | journal = Obesity Research | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 1018–26 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12917508 | doi = 10.1038/oby.2003.140 | type = Research Support }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smoking has a significant effect on an individual's weight. Those who quit smoking gain an average of 4.4&amp;nbsp;kilograms (9.7&amp;nbsp;lb) for men and 5.0&amp;nbsp;kilograms (11.0&amp;nbsp;lb) for women over ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flegal KM, Troiano RP, Pamuk ER, Kuczmarski RJ, Campbell SM | title = The influence of smoking cessation on the prevalence of overweight in the United States | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 333 | issue = 18 | pages = 1165–70 | date = November 1995 | pmid = 7565970 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199511023331801 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/333/18/1165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, changing rates of smoking have had little effect on the overall rates of obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chiolero A, Faeh D, Paccaud F, Cornuz J | title = Consequences of smoking for body weight, body fat distribution, and insulin resistance | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 87 | issue = 4 | pages = 801–9 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18400700 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/87.4.801 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States the number of children a person has is related to their risk of obesity. A woman's risk increases by 7% per child, while a man's risk increases by 4% per child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weng HH, Bastian LA, Taylor DH, Moser BK, Ostbye T | title = Number of children associated with obesity in middle-aged women and men: results from the health and retirement study | journal = Journal of Women's Health | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–91 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15006281 | doi = 10.1089/154099904322836492 | type = Comparative Study }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This could be partly explained by the fact that having dependent children decreases physical activity in Western parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bellows-Riecken KH, Rhodes RE | title = A birth of inactivity?

In the developing world urbanization is playing a role in increasing rate of obesity.  In China overall rates of obesity are below 5%; however, in some cities rates of obesity are greater than 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/media/en/gsfs_obesity.pdf |title=Obesity and Overweight |format=PDF |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |access-date=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malnutrition]] in early life is believed to play a role in the rising rates of obesity in the [[developing world]].&lt;ref name=DC2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caballero B | title = Introduction.

===Gut bacteria===
{{See also|Infectobesity}}
The study of the effect of infectious agents on metabolism is still in its early stages.  [[Gut flora]] has been shown to differ between lean and obese humans. There is an indication that gut flora in obese and lean individuals can affect the metabolic potential. This apparent alteration of the metabolic potential is believed to confer a greater capacity to harvest energy contributing to obesity. Whether these differences are the direct cause or the result of obesity has yet to be determined unequivocally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = DiBaise JK, Zhang H, Crowell MD, Krajmalnik-Brown R, Decker GA, Rittmann BE | title = Gut microbiota and its possible relationship with obesity | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 460–9 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18380992 | doi = 10.4065/83.4.460 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[antibiotics]] among children has also been associated with obesity later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Antibiotics: repeated treatments before the age of two could be a factor in obesity |journal=Prescrire International |date=2018 |url=http://english.prescrire.org/en/(X(1))/81/168/55076/0/2018/ArchiveNewsDetails.aspx?page=1 |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Pathophysiology of obesity}}
There are many possible [[pathophysiology|pathophysiological]] mechanisms involved in the development and maintenance of obesity.&lt;ref name="flier"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flier JS | title = Obesity wars: molecular progress confronts an expanding epidemic | journal = Cell | volume = 116 | issue = 2 | pages = 337–50 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14744442 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)01081-X | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; This field of research had been almost unapproached until the [[leptin]] gene was discovered in 1994 by J.

In particular, they and other appetite-related hormones act on the [[hypothalamus]], a region of the brain central to the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. There are several circuits within the hypothalamus that contribute to its role in integrating appetite, the [[melanocortin]] pathway being the most well understood.&lt;ref name="flier"/&gt; The circuit begins with an area of the hypothalamus, the [[arcuate nucleus]], that has outputs to the [[lateral hypothalamus]] (LH) and [[ventromedial hypothalamus]] (VMH), the brain's feeding and satiety centers, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Boulpaep, Emile L. |author2=Boron, Walter F. |title=Medical physiology: A cellular and molecular approach |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2003 |page=1227 |isbn=978-0-7216-3256-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arcuate nucleus contains two distinct groups of [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref name="flier"/&gt; The first group coexpresses [[neuropeptide Y]] (NPY) and [[agouti-related peptide]] (AgRP) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH. The second group coexpresses [[pro-opiomelanocortin]] (POMC) and [[cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript]] (CART) and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH. Consequently, NPY/AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety, while POMC/CART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding. Both groups of arcuate nucleus neurons are regulated in part by leptin. Leptin inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while stimulating the POMC/CART group. Thus a deficiency in leptin signaling, either via leptin deficiency or leptin resistance, leads to overfeeding and may account for some genetic and acquired forms of obesity.&lt;ref name="flier"/&gt;

In earlier historical periods obesity was rare, and achievable only by a small elite, although already recognised as a problem for health. But as prosperity increased in the [[Early Modern period]], it affected increasingly larger groups of the population.&lt;ref name=Haslam2007/&gt;

In 1997 the WHO formally recognized obesity as a global epidemic.&lt;ref name=Caballero/&gt; As of 2008 the WHO estimates that at least 500&amp;nbsp;million adults (greater than 10%) are obese, with higher rates among women than men.&lt;ref name=WHO2009a&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/index.html |title=Obesity and overweight |website=World Health Organization |access-date=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of adults affected in the United States as of 2015–2016 is about 39.6% overall (37.9% of males and 41.1% of females).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hales CM, Carroll MD, Fryar CD, Ogden CL | title = Prevalence of Obesity Among Adults and Youth: United States, 2015–2016 | journal = NCHS Data Brief | issue = 288 | pages = 1–8 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29155689 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of obesity also increases with age at least up to 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;years old&lt;ref&gt;Seidell 2005 p.5&lt;/ref&gt; and severe obesity in the United States, Australia, and Canada is increasing faster than the overall rate of obesity.&lt;ref name=morbid2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24351678"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Howard NJ, Taylor AW, Gill TK, Chittleborough CR | title = Severe obesity: Investigating the socio-demographics within the extremes of body mass index | journal = Obesity Research &amp; Clinical Practice | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = I–II | date = March 2008 | pmid = 24351678 | doi = 10.1016/j.orcp.2008.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tjepkema2005&gt;{{cite book|author=Tjepkema M |chapter=Measured Obesity–Adult obesity in Canada: Measured height and weight |title=Nutrition: Findings from the Canadian Community Health Survey |publisher=Statistics Canada |date=6 July 2005 |location=Ottawa, Ontario |chapter-url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-620-m/2005001/article/adults-adultes/8060-eng.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[OECD]] has projected an increase in obesity rates until at least 2030, especially in the United States, Mexico and England with rates reaching 47%, 39% and 35% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/Obesity-Update-2017.pdf |title=Obesity Update 2017 |publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |format=PDF |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Etymology===
''Obesity'' is from the [[Latin]] ''obesitas'', which means "stout, fat, or plump".  ''Ēsus'' is the past participle of ''edere'' (to eat), with ''ob'' (over) added to it.&lt;ref name=etymol&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=obesity |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: Obesity |website=Douglas Harper |access-date=31 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]'' documents its first usage in 1611 by [[Randle Cotgrave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/ |title=Obesity, n |website=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] 2008 |access-date=21 March 2009 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111125659/http://www.oed.com/ |archive-date=11 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Venus von Willendorf 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=A carved stone miniature figurine depicted an obese female.|''[[Venus of Willendorf]]'' created 24,000–22,000 BC]]
[[Ancient Greek medicine]] recognizes obesity as a medical disorder, and records that the Ancient Egyptians saw it in the same way.&lt;ref name=Haslam2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haslam D | title = Obesity: a medical history | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 8 Suppl 1 | issue =  | pages = 31–6 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17316298 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00314.x | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hippocrates]] wrote that "Corpulence is not only a disease itself, but the harbinger of others".&lt;ref name=HaslamJames/&gt; The Indian surgeon [[Sushruta]] (6th century BCE) related obesity to diabetes and heart disorders.&lt;ref name=Dwivedi&amp;Dwivedi07/&gt; He recommended physical work to help cure it and its side effects.&lt;ref name=Dwivedi&amp;Dwivedi07&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf |format=PDF |title=History of Medicine: Sushruta – the Clinician – Teacher par Excellence |access-date=19 September 2008 |website=Dwivedi, Girish &amp; Dwivedi, Shridhar |publisher= |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010045900/http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf |archive-date=10 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of human history mankind struggled with food scarcity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Theodore Mazzone |author2=Giamila Fantuzzi |title=Adipose Tissue And Adipokines in Health And Disease (Nutrition and Health) |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |year=2006 |page=222 |isbn=978-1-58829-721-1 |oclc= |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obesity has thus historically been viewed as a sign of wealth and prosperity. It was common among high officials in Europe in the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]&lt;ref name=Zach2003/&gt; as well as in Ancient East Asian civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Keller p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, English medical author [[Tobias Venner]] is credited with being one of the first to refer to the term as a societal disease in a published English language book.&lt;ref name=Haslam2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ShdaOI8TmBAC&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=tobias%20venner%20obesity&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q=tobias%20venner%20obesity&amp;f=false|title=Fat Boys: A Slim Book|first=Sander L|last=Gilman|page=18|publisher= University of Nebraska Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0803221833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] it was realized that the military and economic might of nations were dependent on both the body size and strength of their soldiers and workers.&lt;ref name=Caballero/&gt; Increasing the average body mass index from what is now considered underweight to what is now the normal range played a significant role in the development of industrialized societies.&lt;ref name=Caballero/&gt; Height and weight thus both increased through the 19th&amp;nbsp;century in the developed world. During the 20th century, as populations reached their genetic potential for height, weight began increasing much more than height, resulting in obesity.&lt;ref name=Caballero/&gt; In the 1950s increasing wealth in the developed world decreased child mortality, but as body weight increased heart and kidney disease became more common.&lt;ref name=Caballero/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Breslow L | title = Public health aspects of weight control | journal = American Journal of Public Health and the Nation's Health | volume = 42 | issue = 9 | pages = 1116–20 | date = September 1952 | pmid = 12976585 | pmc = 1526346 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.42.9.1116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
During this time period, insurance companies realized the connection between weight and life expectancy and increased premiums for the obese.&lt;ref name=HaslamJames/&gt;

Many cultures throughout history have viewed obesity as the result of a character flaw. The ''obesus'' or fat character in [[Ancient Greek comedy]] was a glutton and figure of mockery. During Christian times the food was viewed as a gateway to the sins of [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]] and [[lust]].&lt;ref name=Woodhouse/&gt; In modern Western culture, excess weight is often regarded as unattractive, and obesity is commonly associated with various negative stereotypes. People of all ages can face social stigmatization, and may be targeted by bullies or shunned by their peers.&lt;ref name=Bias2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Puhl R, Brownell KD | title = Bias, discrimination, and obesity | journal = Obesity Research | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | pages = 788–805 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11743063 | doi = 10.1038/oby.2001.108 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public perceptions in Western society regarding healthy body weight differ from those regarding the weight that is considered ideal &amp;nbsp;– and both have changed since the beginning of the 20th century. The weight that is viewed as an ideal has become lower since the 1920s. This is illustrated by the fact that the average height of Miss America pageant winners increased by 2% from 1922 to 1999, while their average weight decreased by 12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rubinstein S, Caballero B | title = Is Miss America an undernourished role model? | journal = JAMA | volume = 283 | issue = 12 | pages = 1569 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10735392 | doi = 10.1001/jama.283.12.1569 | type = Letter }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, people's views concerning healthy weight have changed in the opposite direction. In Britain, the weight at which people considered themselves to be overweight was significantly higher in 2007 than in 1999.&lt;ref name=John2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson F, Cooke L, Croker H, Wardle J | title = Changing perceptions of weight in Great Britain: comparison of two population surveys | journal = BMJ | volume = 337 | issue =  | pages = a494 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18617488 | pmc = 2500200 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.a494 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/jul10_1/a494 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These changes are believed to be due to increasing rates of adiposity leading to increased acceptance of extra body fat as being normal.&lt;ref name=John2008/&gt;

Obesity is still seen as a sign of wealth and well-being in many parts of Africa. This has become particularly common since the [[HIV]] epidemic began.&lt;ref name=HaslamJames/&gt;

===The arts===
The first sculptural representations of the human body 20,000–35,000&amp;nbsp;years ago depict obese females. Some attribute the [[Venus figurines]] to the tendency to emphasize fertility while others feel they represent "fatness" in the people of the time.&lt;ref name=Woodhouse/&gt; Corpulence is, however, absent in both Greek and Roman art, probably in keeping with their ideals regarding moderation. This continued through much of Christian European history, with only those of low socioeconomic status being depicted as obese.&lt;ref name=Woodhouse/&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]] some of the upper class began flaunting their large size, as can be seen in portraits of [[Henry VIII of England]] and [[Alessandro dal Borro]].&lt;ref name=Woodhouse/&gt; [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] (1577–1640) regularly depicted full-bodied women in his pictures, from which derives the term [[Peter Paul Rubens#Art|Rubenesque]]. These women, however, still maintained the "hourglass" shape with its relationship to fertility.&lt;ref name=Fumento&gt;{{cite book|author=Fumento, Michael |title=The Fat of the Land: Our Health Crisis and How Overweight Americans Can Help Themselves |publisher=Penguin (Non-Classics) |year=1997 |page=126 |isbn=978-0-14-026144-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, views on obesity changed in the Western world. After centuries of obesity being synonymous with wealth and social status, slimness began to be seen as the desirable standard.&lt;ref name=Woodhouse/&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Economic impact===
In addition to its health impacts, obesity leads to many problems including disadvantages in employment&lt;ref name="Puhl R. p.29"&gt;Puhl R., Henderson K., and Brownell K. 2005 p.29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johansson E, Böckerman P, Kiiskinen U, Heliövaara M | title = Obesity and labour market success in Finland: the difference between having a high BMI and being fat | journal = Economics and Human Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–45 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19249259 | doi = 10.1016/j.ehb.2009.01.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased business costs.  These effects are felt by all levels of society from individuals, to corporations, to governments.

Obesity prevention programs have been found to reduce the cost of treating obesity-related disease. However, the longer people live, the more medical costs they incur. Researchers, therefore, conclude that reducing obesity may improve the public's health, but it is unlikely to reduce overall health spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Baal PH, Polder JJ, de Wit GA, Hoogenveen RT, Feenstra TL, Boshuizen HC, Engelfriet PM, Brouwer WB | title = Lifetime medical costs of obesity: prevention no cure for increasing health expenditure | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = e29 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18254654 | pmc = 2225430 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0050029 | type = Comparative Study }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal goal of the fat acceptance movement is to decrease discrimination against people who are overweight and obese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalnaafa.org/whatisnaafa.html |title=What is NAAFA |website=[[National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance]] |access-date=17 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312001218/http://www.capitalnaafa.org/whatisnaafa.html |archive-date=12 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.size-acceptance.org/mission.html |title=ISAA Mission Statement |website=[[International Size Acceptance Association]] |access-date=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some in the movement are also attempting to challenge the established relationship between obesity and negative health outcomes.&lt;ref name=Pulver2007&gt;{{cite book|author=Pulver, Adam |title=An Imperfect Fit: Obesity, Public Health, and Disability Anti-Discrimination Law |publisher=Social Science Electronic Publishing |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |ssrn=1316106 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of organizations exist that promote the acceptance of obesity. They have increased in prominence in the latter half of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neumark-Sztainer D | title = The weight dilemma: a range of philosophical perspectives | journal = International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders | volume = 23 Suppl 2 | issue =  | pages = S31–7 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10340803 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ijo.0800857 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; The US-based [[National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance]] (NAAFA) was formed in 1969 and describes itself as a civil rights organization dedicated to ending size discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance |url=http://www.naafaonline.com/dev2/ |title=We come in all sizes |publisher=NAAFA |year=2008 |access-date=29 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Size Acceptance Association]] (ISAA) is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) which was founded in 1997. It has more of a global orientation and describes its mission as promoting size acceptance and helping to end weight-based discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.size-acceptance.org/ |title=International Size Acceptance Association – ISAA |website=International Size Acceptance Association |access-date=13 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups often argue for the recognition of obesity as a disability under the US [[Americans With Disabilities Act]] (ADA). The American legal system, however, has decided that the potential public health costs exceed the benefits of extending this anti-discrimination law to cover obesity.&lt;ref name=Pulver2007/&gt;

===Industry influence on research===
In 2015 the ''New York Times'' published an article on the [[Global Energy Balance Network]], a nonprofit founded in 2014 that advocated for people to focus on increasing exercise rather than reducing calorie intake to avoid obesity and to be healthy. The organization was founded with at least $1.5M in funding from the [[Coca-Cola Company]], and the company has provided $4M in research funding to the two founding scientists Gregory A. Hand and Steven N. Blair since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O’Connor|first1=Anahad|title=Coca-Cola Funds Scientists Who Shift Blame for Obesity Away From Bad Diets|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/coca-cola-funds-scientists-who-shift-blame-for-obesity-away-from-bad-diets/?login=email&amp;mtrref=www.nytimes.com|work=New York Times|date=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NesleJAMA&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nestle M | title = Food Industry Funding of Nutrition Research: The Relevance of History for Current Debates | journal = JAMA Internal Medicine | volume = 176 | issue = 11 | pages = 1685–1686 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27618496 | doi = 10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.5400 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood obesity==
{{Main|Childhood obesity}}
The healthy BMI range varies with the age and sex of the child. Obesity in children and adolescents is defined as a BMI greater than the 95th&amp;nbsp;[[percentile]].&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt; The reference data that these percentiles are based on is from 1963 to 1994 and thus has not been affected by the recent increases in rates of obesity.&lt;ref name="Flegal KM, Ogden CL, Wei R, Kuczmarski RL, Johnson CL 2001 1086–93"/&gt; Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the 21st&amp;nbsp;century, with rising rates in both the developed and the developing world. Rates of obesity in Canadian boys have increased from 11% in the 1980s to over 30% in the 1990s, while during this same time period rates increased from 4 to 14% in Brazilian children.&lt;ref name=flynn2006/&gt;

As with obesity in adults, many factors contribute to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity are believed to be the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dollman J, Norton K, Norton L | title = Evidence for secular trends in children's physical activity behaviour | journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 39 | issue = 12 | pages = 892–7; discussion 897 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16306494 | pmc = 1725088 | doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2004.016675 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for [[hypertension]], [[diabetes]], [[hyperlipidemia]], and [[fatty liver]].&lt;ref name=CADG2006/&gt; Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success.&lt;ref name="pmid23044984"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Metcalf B, Henley W, Wilkin T | title = Effectiveness of intervention on physical activity of children: systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials with objectively measured outcomes (EarlyBird 54) | journal = BMJ | volume = 345 | issue =  | pages = e5888 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 23044984 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.e5888 | type = Review, Meta-analysis }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group.&lt;ref name=flynn2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flynn MA, McNeil DA, Maloff B, Mutasingwa D, Wu M, Ford C, Tough SC | title = Reducing obesity and related chronic disease risk in children and youth: a synthesis of evidence with 'best practice' recommendations | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 7 Suppl 1 | issue =  | pages = 7–66 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16371076 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2006.00242.x | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; Multi-component behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although the benefits are small and quality of evidence is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mead E, Brown T, Rees K, Azevedo LB, Whittaker V, Jones D, Olajide J, Mainardi GM, Corpeleijn E, O'Malley C, Beardsmore E, Al-Khudairy L, Baur L, Metzendorf MI, Demaio A, Ells LJ | title = Diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obese children from the age of 6 to 11 years | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 6 | pages = CD012651 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28639319 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD012651 | url = http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/87566/7/WRAP-diet-physical-activity-behavioural-interventions-Mead-2017.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obesity in pets is common in many countries. In the United States, 23–41% of dogs are overweight, and about 5.1% are obese.&lt;ref name=Lund2006&gt;{{cite journal| last = Lund | first = Elizabeth M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Prevalence and Risk Factors for Obesity in Adult Dogs from Private US Veterinary Practices |journal=Intern J Appl Res Vet Med |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=177–86 |year=2006 |pmid= |doi= |url=http://www.jarvm.com/articles/Vol4Iss2/Lund.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of obesity in cats was slightly higher at 6.4%.&lt;ref name= Lund2006/&gt; In Australia the rate of obesity among dogs in a veterinary setting has been found to be 7.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGreevy PD, Thomson PC, Pride C, Fawcett A, Grassi T, Jones B | title = Prevalence of obesity in dogs examined by Australian veterinary practices and the risk factors involved | journal = The Veterinary Record | volume = 156 | issue = 22 | pages = 695–702 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15923551 | doi = 10.1136/vr.156.22.695 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of obesity in dogs is related to whether or not their owners are obese; however, there is no similar correlation between cats and their owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nijland ML, Stam F, Seidell JC | title = Overweight in dogs, but not in cats, is related to overweight in their owners | journal = Public Health Nutrition | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 102–6 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19545467 | doi = 10.1017/S136898000999022X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Online doctor''' is a term that emerged during the 2000s, used by both the media &lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/yourlife/health/healthcare/doctorsnurses/2010-11-19-1Ateledoc19_ST_N.htm Are online doctors the best medicine?], ''USA Today'', 20 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and academics, to describe a generation of [[physicians]] and health practitioners who deliver healthcare, including drug prescription, over the internet.

==Emergence of online doctoring==
In the 2000s, many people came to treat the internet as a first, or at least a major, source of information and communication. Health advice is now the second-most popular topic, after pornography, that people search for on the internet.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/jun/04/life1.lifemagazine6?INTCMP=SRCH House call - No appointments, no waiting, speedy diagnosis and prescription - online doctors are flourishing. But are they safe?], ''The Guardian'', 4 June 2000&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of [[broadband]] and [[videoconferencing]], many individuals have turned to online doctors to receive online consultations and purchase prescription drugs. Use of this technology has many advantages for both the doctor and the patient, including cost savings, convenience, accessibility, and improved privacy and communication.

In the US, a 2006 study found that searching for information on prescription or over-the-counter drugs was the fifth most popular search topic, and a 2004 study found that 4% of Americans had purchased prescription medications online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2006/PIP_Online_Health_2006.pdf.pdf Online health search] S. Fox, 2006. [http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2004/PIP_Prescription_Drugs_Online.pdf.pdf, Prescription drugs online] S. Fox, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 survey conducted by Geneva-based [[Health On the Net Foundation]] found one-in-ten Europeans buys medicines from websites and one-third claim to use online consultation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20585/ Online Patient Safety Climate Survey: Tool Development and Lessons Learned], Lynne M. Connelly and Judy L. Powers, ''U.S. National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health''&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, approximately seven million people buy from mail-order pharmacies, and mail-order sales account for approximately 8–10% of total pharmaceutical sales.&lt;ref&gt;Mail-order trade in medicines in Europe: a guide for legislators to protect consumers, NJ Seeberg-Elverfeldt ''[[European Journal of Health Law]]'' 16: 351–66, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain reported that approximately two million people in Great Britain were regularly purchasing pharmaceuticals online (both with a prescription from registered online UK doctors and without prescriptions from other websites).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rpsgb.org/pdfs/pr080110.pdf Millions risk health buying drugs online] ''Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A recent survey commissioned by [[Pfizer]], the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]], [[RPSGB]], the [[Patients Association]] and [[HEART UK]] found that 15% of the British adults asked had bought a prescription-only medicine online.&lt;ref name="RPSGB"&gt;[http://www.rpsgb.org/pdfs/pr091103.pdf Get Real, Get a Prescription’ campaign] ''Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In developed countries, many online doctors prescribe so-called ‘lifestyle drugs’,&lt;ref&gt;Medicalisation: The role of e-pharmacies in iatrogenic harm, N. Glover-Thomas and J. Fanning, ''Medical Law Review'' 18(1): 28–55, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; such as for weight loss, hair loss or erectile dysfunction. The RPSGB has identified the most popular products prescribed online as [[Prozac]] (an antidepressant), [[Viagra]] (for erectile dysfunction), [[Valium]] (a tranquiliser), [[Ritalin]] (a psychostimulant), [[Serostim]] (a synthetic growth hormone) and [[Provigil]] (a psychostimulant).&lt;ref&gt;RPSGB p.12&lt;/ref&gt; A study in the USA has also shown that antibiotics are commonly available online without prescription.&lt;ref&gt;Availability of antibiotics for purchase without a prescription on the internet, AG Mainous, CJ Everett, RE Post, VA Diaz and WJ Hueston, ''Annals of Family Medicine'' 7(5): 431–5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential harm==
Traditionalist critics of online doctors argue that an online doctor cannot provide proper examinations or diagnosis either by email or video call.&lt;ref&gt;[http://specials.ft.com/lifeonthenet/FT3FFJPZLCC.html Consulting Online] ''Financial Times'', 1 September 2000
&lt;/ref&gt; Such consultations, they argue, will always be dangerous, with the potential for serious disease to be missed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/yourlife/health/healthcare/doctorsnurses/2010-11-19-1Ateledoc19_ST_N.htm Are Online Doctors The Best Medicine?], ''USA Today'' quoting Roland Goertz of the American Academy of Family Physicians, 20 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; There are also concerns that the absence of proximity leads to treatment by unqualified doctors &lt;ref&gt;USA Today&lt;/ref&gt; or patients using false information to secure dangerous drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/feb/13/health.medicineandhealth?INTCMP=SRCH Online doctor put patients at risk, hearing told] ''The Guardian'', 3 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents argue there is little difference between an e-mail consultation and the sort of telephone assessment and advice that doctors regularly make out of hours or in circumstances where doctors cannot physically examine a patient (e.g., jungle medicine).&lt;ref name="The Times"&gt;[http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/general-coffeehouse-chat-514/news-current-affairs-topical-discussion-12/628933-doctor-will-see-you-now-over-internet.html The doctor will see you now . . . over the internet]''The Times'' quoting Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS Medical Director, 29 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurence Buckman, chairman of the [[British Medical Association]]’s GPs’ committee, says that online consultations make life easier for doctors and patients when used properly. "Many GPs will be very happy with it and it could be useful. When it’s a regular patient you know well, it follows on from telephone consulting. Voice is essential, vision is desirable. The problem comes when I don’t know the patient".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Times&lt;/ref&gt;
Niall Dickson, chief executive of the [[General Medical Council]], says: "We trust doctors to use their judgement to decide whether they should see a patient in person. Online consultations will be appropriate for some patients, whereas other patients will need a physical examination or may benefit from seeing their doctor in person".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Past and future developments==
The first medical consulting website in the US was [[WebMD]],&lt;ref name="History of WebMD"&gt;[//www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/WebMD-Corporation-company-History.html Corporate History] History of WebMD&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1996 by [[James H. Clark|Jim Clark]] (one of the founders of [[Netscape]]) and [[Pavan Nigam]] as [[Healthscape]]. Currently, its website carries information regarding health and health care, including a symptom checklist, pharmacy information, drug information, blogs of physicians with specific topics, and a place to store personal medical information. As of February 2011, WebMD’s network of sites reaches an average of 86.4 million visitors per month&lt;ref&gt;History of WebMD&lt;/ref&gt; and is the leading health portal in the United States.&lt;ref name="comScore Media Metrix"&gt;[http://www.sramanamitra.com/2007/08/21/web-30-online-health-part-2/ comScore Media Metrix rating] ''Web 3.0 &amp; Online Health'', comScore Media Metrix rating 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Other popular US healthcare and medical consulting sites include [[NIH.gov]], [[MSN Health]], [[Doctorspring]], [[MdLive]], [[Justdoc]], [[Yahoo! Health]], [[EverydayHealth]], [[WomensHealth.gov]], [[MayoClinic]], [[Doctor Vista]], and many have experienced dramatic growth. ([[Healthline]], launched in 2005, grew by 269% to 2.7 million average monthly unique visitors in Q1 2007 from 0.8 million average monthly unique visitors in Q1 2006).&lt;ref&gt;comScore Media Metrix&lt;/ref&gt; Niche consulting sites are also popular including [[SeniorNet]], which deals with age-related syndromes and [[4collegewomen.org]] and [[GirlsHealth.gov]], which target young women. Several American online doctor companies, including Sherpaa, MDlive, [[Teladoc]], First Stop Health, American Well, WebDoc247, MeMD, and Ringadoc, provide consultations with doctors over the phone or the Internet. Prominent [[San Francisco]]-based venture capital firm [[Founders Fund]] called such services "extraordinarily fast" and predicted that they will "bring relief to thousands of people with immediate medical needs".&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/07/ringadoc-virtually-connects-you-with-a-doctor-anytime-raises-750k-seed-from-founders-funds-ff-angel/] ''TechCrunch'', retrieved 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, [[e-med]] was the first online health site to offer both a diagnosis and prescriptions to patients over the Internet. It was established in March 2000 by Dr. [[Jules Eden|Julian Eden]],&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/841031.stm GP treats patients 'over the internet'] ''BBC'',23 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[DrThom]] claimed to have 100,000 patients visit their site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/2010-08-07-british-online-doctors_N.htm British websites are pushing boundaries of online medicine] 'USA Today', 8 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; NHS Direct (currently [http://www.nhs.uk/pages/home.aspx NHS Choices]) is the free health advice and information service provided by the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) for residents and visitors in the UK, with advice offered 24 hours a day via telephone and web contact. Over 1.5 million patients visit the website every month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/About/History?name=HistoryOfNHSDirect History of NHS Direct] ''NHS Direct'', retrieved 14 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a number of online doctors have emerged in the country, firms such as Now Healthcare Group, [[Dr Fox Pharmacy]], [[Push Doctor]] and [[Lloyds Pharmacy]] offer consultation and prescriptions via the Internet.

In Australia [[HealthDirect]] is the free health advice and information service provided by the government with advice offered 24 hours a day via telephone. [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] began funding online consultations for specialists on 1 July 2011 which has seen a slow but steady increase in volumes.

New advances in digital information technology mean that in future online doctors and healthcare websites may offer advanced scanning and diagnostic services over the internet. The [[Nuffield Council on Bioethics]] identifies such services as direct-to-consumer body imaging (such as CT and MRI scans) and personal genetic profiling for individual susceptibility to disease.&lt;ref&gt;Nuffield p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Sir [[Bruce Keogh]], the medical director of the UK NHS, is drawing up plans to introduce online consultations via Skype and has said IT will "completely change the way [doctors] deliver medicine". This concept is gaining more importance and there are some companies who started cashing on it, few companies like [[ZocDoc|Zocdoc]] or [[Ziffi.com|Ziffi]] have started providing online doctor booking service.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Organic food''' is [[food]] produced by methods that comply with the standards of [[organic farming]]. Standards vary worldwide, but organic farming in general features practices that strive to cycle resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve [[biodiversity]]. Organizations regulating organic products may restrict the use of certain [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s in farming. In general, organic foods are also usually not processed using [[Food irradiation|irradiation]], industrial solvents or synthetic [[food additives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~lhom/organictext.html |title=Pesticides in Organic Farming |quote=Organic foods are not necessarily pesticide-free. Organic foods are produced using only certain pesticides with specific ingredients. Organic pesticides tend to have substances like soaps, lime sulfur and [[hydrogen peroxide]] as ingredients. Not all natural substances are allowed in organic agriculture; some chemicals like arsenic, strychnine, and tobacco dust (nicotine sulfate) are prohibited.|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and many other countries require producers to obtain [[Organic certification|special certification]] in order to market food as organic within their borders. In the context of these [[regulations]], organic food is produced in a way that complies with organic standards set by regional organizations, national governments and international organizations. Although the produce of [[kitchen garden]]s may be organic, selling food with an organic label is regulated by governmental food safety authorities, such as the [[National Organic Program|US Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) or [[European Commission]] (EC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/organic/organic-farming/what-is-organic-farming/organic-certification/index_en.htm|title=Organic certification|publisher=European Commission: Agriculture and Rural Development|date=2014|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fertilizing and the use of pesticides in conventional farming has caused, and is causing, enormous damage worldwide to local [[ecosystem]]s, biodiversity, [[groundwater]] and [[drinking water]] supplies, and sometimes farmer health and [[fertility]]. These environmental, economic and health issues are intended to be minimized or avoided in organic farming. From a consumers perspective, there is not sufficient evidence in scientific and [[medical literature]] to support claims that organic food is [[Food safety|safer]] or healthier to eat than conventionally grown food. While there may be some differences in the nutrient and [[antinutrient]] contents of organically- and conventionally-produced food, the variable nature of [[food production]] and handling makes it difficult to generalize results.&lt;ref name=2014meta/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blair1"&gt;Blair, Robert.

==Meaning and origin of the term==
{{details|topic=the production of organic food|Organic farming}}

For the vast majority of its history, agriculture can be described as having been organic; only during the 20th century was a large supply of new products, generally deemed not organic, introduced into food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/teaching-the-food-system/curriculum/_pdf/History_of_Food-Background.pdf|title=History of food, p. 3|author=|date=|website=jhsph.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organic farming movement arose in the 1940s in response to the [[industrialization]] of [[agriculture]].&lt;ref name=Drinkwater&gt;{{cite book|author=Drinkwater, Laurie E.|chapter=Ecological Knowledge: Foundation for Sustainable Organic Agriculture|editor=Francis, Charles|title=Organic farming: the ecological system|publisher=ASA-CSSA-SSSA|year=2009|isbn=978-0-89118-173-6|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8HMfbQpNq60C&amp;pg=PA19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, [[Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne|Lord Northbourne]] coined the term ''organic farming'' in his book ''Look to the Land'' (1940), out of his conception of "the farm as organism," to describe a holistic, ecologically balanced approach to farming—in contrast to what he called ''chemical farming,'' which relied on "imported fertility" and "cannot be self-sufficient nor an organic whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=John, Paull|title=The Farm as Organism: The Foundational Idea of Organic Agriculture|journal = Elementals: Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania|volume=80|year=2006|pages=14–18|url=http://orgprints.org/10138/01/10138.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early soil scientists also described the differences in soil composition when animal manures were used as "organic", because they contain carbon compounds where superphosphates and haber process nitrogen do not. Their respective use affects [[humus]] content of soil.&lt;ref name=Betteshanger&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/19511/1/Paull2011BetteshangerJOS.pdf  "The Betteshanger Summer School: Missing link between biodynamic agriculture and organic farming"], ''Journal of Organic Systems'', 2011, 6(2):13-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howard|first1=Sir Albert|title=Farming and Gardening for Health or Disease (The Soil and Health)|url=http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/howardSH/SHtoc.html|website=Journey to forever online library|publisher=Faber and Faber Limited|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is different from the scientific use of the term "organic" in chemistry, which refers to [[organic compound|a class of molecules that contain carbon]], especially those involved in the chemistry of life. This class of molecules includes everything likely to be considered edible, and include most pesticides and toxins too, therefore the term "organic" and, especially, the term "inorganic" (sometimes wrongly used as a contrast by the popular press) as they apply to organic chemistry is an equivocation fallacy when applied to farming, the production of food, and to foodstuffs themselves. Properly used in this agricultural science context, "organic" refers to the methods grown and processed, not necessarily the chemical composition of the food.

Ideas that organic food could be healthier and better for the environment originated in the early days of the [[organic movement]] as a result of publications like the 1943 book [[The Living Soil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balfour|first1=Lady Eve|title=Towards a Sustainable Agriculture--The Living Soil|url=http://www.soilandhealth.org/01aglibrary/010116Balfourspeech.html|publisher=IFOAM|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lady Balfour|url=http://www.ifoam.org/en/lady-eve-balfour|website=IFOAM|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Farming and Gardening for Health or Disease'' (1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howard|first1=Sir Albert|title=Farming and Gardening for Health or Disease (The Soil and Health)|url=http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/howardSH/SH10.html|website=Journey to forever online library|publisher=Faber and Faber Limited|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the industrial era, organic gardening reached a modest level of popularity in the United States in the 1950s. In the 1960s, environmentalists and the counterculture championed organic food, but it was only in the 1970s that a national marketplace for organic foods developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UjEtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT302&amp;dq=whole+foods#v=onepage&amp;q=whole%20foods&amp;f=false|title=From Head Shops to Whole Foods: The Rise and Fall of Activist Entrepreneurs|last=Davis|first=Joshua Clark|date=2017-08-08|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231543088|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early consumers interested in organic food would look for non-chemically treated, non-use of unapproved pesticides, fresh or minimally processed food. They mostly had to buy directly from growers. Later, "Know your farmer, know your food" became the motto of a new initiative instituted by the USDA in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Philpott|first=Tom|title=Quick thoughts on the USDA's 'Know Your Farmer' program|url=http://grist.org/article/2009-09-16-quick-thoughts-on-the-usdas-know-your-farmer-program|website=Grist * A Beacon in the Smog|publisher=Grist Magazine, Inc.|accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal definitions of what constituted "organic" were developed through firsthand experience: by talking to farmers, seeing farm conditions, and farming activities. Small farms grew vegetables (and raised livestock) using [[organic farming]] practices, with or without certification, and the individual consumer monitored.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Small specialty health food stores and co-operatives were instrumental to bringing organic food to a wider audience.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} As demand for organic foods continued to increase, high volume sales through mass outlets such as supermarkets rapidly replaced the direct farmer connection.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Today, many large corporate farms have an organic division. However, for supermarket consumers, food production is not easily observable, and product labeling, like "certified organic," is relied upon. Government regulations and third-party inspectors are looked to for assurance.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In the 1970s, interest in organic food grew with the publication of [[Silent Spring]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paull|first1=John|title=The Rachel Carson Letters and the  Making of Silent Spring|url=http://orgprints.org/22934/7/22934.pdf|publisher=SAGE|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of the [[environmental movement]], and was also spurred by food-related health scares like the concerns about [[Daminozide|Alar]] that arose in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pollan|first1=Michael|title=The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals|date=2006|publisher=The Penguin Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic food production is a self-regulated industry with government oversight in some countries, distinct from [[Kitchen garden|private gardening]]. Currently, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan, and many other countries require producers to obtain [[Organic certification|special certification]] based on government-defined standards in order to market food as organic within their borders. In the context of these regulations, foods marketed as organic are produced in a way that complies with organic standards set by national governments and international organic industry trade organizations.

In the United States, organic production is managed in accordance with the [[Organic Foods Production Act of 1990]] (OFPA) and regulations in Title 7, Part 205 of the Code of Federal Regulations to respond to site-specific conditions by integrating cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/nop |title=Agricultural Marketing Service – National Organic Program |publisher=Ams.usda.gov |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; If livestock are involved, the livestock must be reared with regular access to pasture and without the routine use of antibiotics or [[Bovine somatotropin|growth hormones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5082653&amp;acct=noprulemaking|title=Access to Pasture Rule for Organic Livestock|publisher=Ams.usda.gov|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Processed organic food usually contains only organic ingredients. If non-organic ingredients are present, at least a certain percentage of the food's total plant and animal ingredients must be organic (95% in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELDEV3004323&amp;acct=nopgeninfo |title=Labeling: Preamble |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada, and Australia).  Foods claiming to be organic must be free of artificial [[food additives]], and are often processed with fewer artificial methods, materials and conditions, such as [[SmartFresh|chemical ripening]], [[food irradiation]], and [[genetically modified]] ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editors=Allen, Gary J. &amp; Albala, Ken|title=The Business of Food: Encyclopedia of the Food and Drink Industries|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2007|isbn=978-0-313-33725-3|page=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNzmOUyiFRAC&amp;pg=PA288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pesticides are allowed as long as they are not synthetic.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, National Pesticide Information Center [http://npic.orst.edu/ingred/organic.html Organic Pesticide Ingredients]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, under US federal organic standards, if pests and weeds are not controllable through management practices, nor via organic pesticides and herbicides, "a substance included on the National List of synthetic substances allowed for use in organic crop production may be applied to prevent, suppress, or control pests, weeds, or diseases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=622a69a51febf44818ad4c8d3535378f&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=7:3.1.1.9.32.3.354.7&amp;idno=7|title=eCFR — Code of Federal Regulations|author=|date=|website=www.ecfr.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several groups have called for organic standards to prohibit [[nanotechnology]] on the basis of the [[precautionary principle]]&lt;ref name="Paull"&gt;Paull, J. &amp; Lyons, K.

It also may have the USDA seal. 2)‘Organic’: At least 95% or more of the ingredients are organic. 3)’Made With Organic Ingredients': Contains at least 70% organic ingredients. 4)‘Less Than 70% Organic Ingredients’: Three of the organic ingredients must be listed under the ingredient section of the label.&lt;ref&gt;"USDA organic: what qualifies as organic?"

==Public perception==

There is widespread public belief that organic food is safer, more nutritious, and better tasting than conventional food,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Kim Kennedy|last2=Duram|first2=Leslie A|title=America Goes Green: An Encyclopedia of Eco-friendly Culture in the United States|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=California|isbn=978-1-59884-657-7|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has largely contributed to the development of an [[organic food culture]]. Consumers purchase organic foods for different reasons, including concerns about the effects of conventional farming practices on the environment, human health, and animal welfare.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Deciphering Organic Foods: A Comprehensive Guide to Organic Food Production, Consumption, and Promotion|url = https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=60312|website = novapublishers.com|accessdate = 2016-10-29}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important reason for purchasing organic foods seems to be beliefs about the products' health-giving properties and higher nutritional value.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yiridoe|first=Emmanuel|last2=Bonti-Ankomah|first2=Samuel|last3=C.

Some foods, such as bananas, are picked when unripe, are cooled to prevent ripening while they are shipped to market, and then are induced to ripen quickly by exposing them to [[propylene]] or [[ethylene]], chemicals produced by plants to induce their own ripening; as flavor and texture changes during ripening, this process may affect those qualities of the treated fruit.&lt;ref&gt;Washington State University Extension Office.

==Chemical composition==
[[File:Sign at the Sonoma Farmers market - Stierch.jpg|thumb|upright|Organic vegetables at a farmers' market]]
With respect to chemical differences in the composition of organically grown food compared with conventionally grown food, studies have examined differences in [[nutrients]], [[antinutrients]], and [[pesticide]] residues.&lt;ref name=baranski2017/&gt; These studies generally suffer from [[confounding]] variables, and are difficult to generalize due to differences in the tests that were done, the methods of testing, and because the vagaries of agriculture affect the chemical composition of food;&lt;ref name=baranski2017/&gt; these variables include variations in weather (season to season as well as place to place); crop treatments (fertilizer, pesticide, etc.); soil composition; the cultivar used, and in the case of meat and dairy products, the parallel variables in animal production.&lt;ref name=2014meta/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/&gt;  Treatment of the foodstuffs after initial gathering (whether milk is pasteurized or raw), the length of time between harvest and analysis, as well as conditions of transport and storage, also affect the chemical composition of a given item of food.&lt;ref name=2014meta/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/&gt; Additionally, there is evidence that organic produce is drier than conventionally grown produce; a higher content in any chemical category may be explained by higher concentration rather than in absolute amounts.&lt;ref name=Blair1/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2015}}

===Nutrients===
Many people believe that organic foods have higher content of nutrients and thus are healthier than conventionally produced foods.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web|title=Organic Food No More Nutritious than Non-organic: Study|publisher=Reuters Health|author=Genevra Pittman|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-organic-idUSBRE88303620120904|date=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientists have not been equally convinced that this is the case as the research conducted in the field has not shown consistent results.

A 2009 systematic review found that organically produced foodstuffs are not richer in vitamins and minerals than conventionally produced foodstuffs.&lt;ref name="Smith-Spangler2012" /&gt; The results of the systematic review only showed a lower nitrogen and higher phosphorus content in organic produced compared to conventionally grown foodstuffs. Content of vitamin C, calcium, potassium, total soluble solids, copper, iron, nitrates, manganese, and sodium did not differ between the two categories.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;

A 2012 survey of the scientific literature did not find significant differences in the vitamin content of organic and conventional plant or animal products, and found that results varied from study to study.&lt;ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/&gt; Produce studies reported on [[ascorbic acid]] ([[vitamin C]]) (31 studies), [[beta-carotene]] (a precursor for [[vitamin A]]) (12 studies), and [[alpha-tocopherol]] (a form of [[vitamin E]]) (5 studies) content;  milk studies reported on beta-carotene (4 studies) and alpha-tocopherol levels (4 studies). Few studies examined vitamin content in meats, but these found no difference in beta-carotene in beef, alpha-tocopherol in pork or beef, or vitamin A (retinol) in beef. The authors analyzed 11 other nutrients reported in studies of produce. A 2011 literature review found that organic foods had a higher micronutrient content overall than conventionally produced foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunter|first1=Duncan|last2=Foster|first2=Meika|last3=McArthur|first3=Jennifer O.|last4=Ojha|first4=Rachel|last5=Petocz|first5=Peter|last6=Samman|first6=Samir|title=Evaluation of the Micronutrient Composition of Plant Foods Produced by Organic and Conventional Agricultural Methods|journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|date=July 2011|volume=51|issue=6|pages=571–582|doi=10.1080/10408391003721701|pmid=21929333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, organic chicken contained higher levels of [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s{{Citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=Not in references}} than conventional chicken. The authors found no difference in the protein or fat content of organic and conventional raw milk.&lt;ref name=Magkos2003&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12907407|year=2003|author1=Magkos|first1=F|title=Organic food: Nutritious food or food for thought?

A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found that organic meat had comparable or slightly lower levels of [[saturated fat]] and [[monounsaturated fat]] as conventional meat, but higher levels of both overall and n-3 [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Średnicka-Tober|first1=D|last2=Barański|first2=M|last3=Seal|first3=C|last4=Sanderson|first4=R|last5=Benbrook|first5=C|last6=Steinshamn|first6=H|last7=Gromadzka-Ostrowska|first7=J|last8=Rembiałkowska|first8=E|last9=Skwarło-Sońta|first9=K|last10=Eyre|first10=M|last11=Cozzi|first11=G|last12=Krogh Larsen|first12=M|last13=Jordon|first13=T|last14=Niggli|first14=U|last15=Sakowski|first15=T|last16=Calder|first16=PC|last17=Burdge|first17=GC|last18=Sotiraki|first18=S|last19=Stefanakis|first19=A|last20=Yolcu|first20=H|last21=Stergiadis|first21=S|last22=Chatzidimitriou|first22=E|last23=Butler|first23=G|last24=Stewart|first24=G|last25=Leifert|first25=C|title=Composition differences between organic and conventional meat: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis|journal=The British Journal of Nutrition|date=March 2016|volume=115|issue=6|pages=994–1011|doi=10.1017/S0007114515005073|pmid=26878675|pmc=4838835}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another meta-analysis published the same year found no significant differences in levels of saturated and monounsaturated fat between organic and conventional milk,  but significantly higher levels of overall and n-3 [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s in organic milk than in conventional milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Średnicka-Tober|first1=D|last2=Barański|first2=M|last3=Seal|first3=CJ|last4=Sanderson|first4=R|last5=Benbrook|first5=C|last6=Steinshamn|first6=H|last7=Gromadzka-Ostrowska|first7=J|last8=Rembiałkowska|first8=E|last9=Skwarło-Sońta|first9=K|last10=Eyre|first10=M|last11=Cozzi|first11=G|last12=Larsen|first12=MK|last13=Jordon|first13=T|last14=Niggli|first14=U|last15=Sakowski|first15=T|last16=Calder|first16=PC|last17=Burdge|first17=GC|last18=Sotiraki|first18=S|last19=Stefanakis|first19=A|last20=Stergiadis|first20=S|last21=Yolcu|first21=H|last22=Chatzidimitriou|first22=E|last23=Butler|first23=G|last24=Stewart|first24=G|last25=Leifert|first25=C|title=Higher PUFA and n-3 PUFA, conjugated linoleic acid, α-tocopherol and iron, but lower iodine and selenium concentrations in organic milk: a systematic literature review and meta- and redundancy analyses|journal=British Journal of Nutrition|date=March 2016|volume=115|issue=6|pages=1043–60|doi=10.1017/S0007114516000349|pmid=26878105|pmc=4838834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-nutrients===
The amount of [[nitrogen]] content in certain vegetables, especially green [[leafy vegetables]] and [[tuber]]s, has been found to be lower when grown organically as compared to conventionally.&lt;ref name=MagkosSafety2006 /&gt;  When evaluating environmental toxins such as [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], the USDA has noted that organically raised [[chicken]] may have lower [[arsenic]] levels.&lt;ref name=USDA /&gt; Early literature reviews found no significant evidence that levels of arsenic, [[cadmium]] or other heavy metals differed significantly between organic and conventional food products.&lt;ref name=Blair1/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;ref name=MagkosSafety2006 /&gt; However, a 2014 review found lower concentrations of cadmium, particularly in organically grown grains.&lt;ref name=2014meta/&gt;

===Phytochemicals===
A 2014 meta-analysis of 343 studies on [[phytochemical]] composition found that organically grown crops had lower [[cadmium]] and pesticide residues, and 17% higher concentrations of [[polyphenols]] than conventionally grown crops.&lt;ref name="2014meta"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barański|first1=M|last2=Srednicka-Tober|first2=D|last3=Volakakis|first3=N|last4=Seal|first4=C|last5=Sanderson|first5=R|last6=Stewart|first6=GB|last7=Benbrook|first7=C|last8=Biavati|first8=B|last9=Markellou|first9=E|last10=Giotis|first10=C|last11=Gromadzka-Ostrowska|first11=J|last12=Rembiałkowska|first12=E|last13=Skwarło-Sońta|first13=K|last14=Tahvonen|first14=R|last15=Janovská|first15=D|last16=Niggli|first16=U|last17=Nicot|first17=P|last18=Leifert|first18=C|title=Higher antioxidant and lower cadmium concentrations and lower incidence of pesticide residues in organically grown crops: a systematic literature review and meta-analyses|journal=The British Journal of Nutrition|year=2014|pages=1–18|pmid=24968103|doi=10.1017/S0007114514001366|volume=112|issue=5|pmc=4141693}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations of [[phenolic acids]], [[flavanones]], [[stilbenes]], [[flavones]], [[flavonols]], and [[anthocyanins]] were elevated, with [[flavanones]] being 69% higher.&lt;ref name=2014meta/&gt; Studies on phytochemical composition of organic crops have numerous deficiencies, including absence of standardized measurements and poor reporting on measures of variability, duplicate or selective reporting of data, publication bias, lack of rigor in studies comparing pesticide residue levels in organic and conventional crops, the geographical origin of samples, and inconsistency of farming and post-harvest methods.&lt;ref name=2014meta/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith-Spangler2012" /&gt;

===Pesticide residues===
{{main|Pesticide residue}}
The amount of pesticides that remain in or on food is called pesticide residue. In the United States, before a pesticide can be used on a food crop, the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] must determine whether that pesticide can be used without posing a risk to human health.&lt;ref&gt;"Pesticides Health and Safety Information." National Pesticides Information Center. National Pesticides Information Center, 1 Apr.2014.Web.9 Nov.2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 meta-analysis determined that detectable pesticide residues were found in 7% of organic produce samples and 38% of conventional produce samples. This result was statistically heterogeneous, potentially because of the variable level of detection used among these studies.  Only three studies reported the prevalence of contamination exceeding maximum allowed limits; all were from the European Union.&lt;ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/&gt; A 2014 meta-analysis found that conventionally grown produce was four times more likely to have pesticide residue than organically grown crops.&lt;ref name=2014meta/&gt;

The [[American Cancer Society]] has stated that no evidence exists that the small amount of pesticide residue found on conventional foods will increase the risk of cancer, although it recommends thoroughly washing fruits and vegetables. They have also stated that there is no research to show that organic food reduces cancer risk compared to foods grown with conventional farming methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/healthy/eathealthygetactive/acsguidelinesonnutritionphysicalactivityforcancerprevention/acs-guidelines-on-nutrition-and-physical-activity-for-cancer-prevention-diet-cancer-questions |title=Common questions about diet and cancer |publisher=Cancer.org |accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Environmental Protection Agency maintains strict guidelines on the regulation of pesticides by setting a tolerance on the amount of pesticide residue allowed to be in or on any particular food.&lt;ref&gt;2013 November, "The ruling on organic foods: are they worth the extra price?" "Healthy Years" ISSN 1551-4617, 11/2013, Volume 10, Issue 11, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/food/viewtols.htm|title=Pesticides and Food: What the Pesticide Residue Limits are on Food|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|date=20 October 2014|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although some residue may remain at the time of harvest, residue tend to decline as the pesticide breaks down over time. In addition, as the commodities are washed and processed prior to sale, the residues often diminish further.

===Bacterial contamination===
A 2012 [[meta-analysis]] determined that prevalence of ''[[E. coli]]'' contamination was not [[statistically significant]] (7% in organic produce and 6% in conventional produce). While bacterial contamination is common among both organic and conventional animal products, differences in the prevalence of bacterial contamination between organic and conventional animal products were also statistically insignificant.&lt;ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/&gt;

==Organic meat production requirements==

===United States===
Organic meat certification in the United States requires farm animals to be raised according to USDA organic regulations throughout their lives. These regulations require that livestock are fed certified organic food that contains no animal byproducts.&lt;ref name="usda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5102526 |title=Organic Livestock Requirements |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |date=July 2013 |accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, organic farm animals can receive no [[growth hormones]] or [[antibiotics]], and they must be raised using techniques that protect native species and other natural resources. [[Irradiation]] and [[genetic engineering]] are not allowed with organic animal production.&lt;ref name="usda"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usda.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?parentnav=FAQS_BYTOPIC&amp;FAQ_NAVIGATION_ID=ORGANIC_FQ&amp;FAQ_NAVIGATION_TYPE=FAQS_BYTOPIC&amp;contentid=faqdetail-3.xml&amp;edeployment_action=retrievecontent |title=How does USDA define the term organic? &amp;#124; USDA |publisher=Usda.gov |date=2004-06-24 |accessdate=2014-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009091219/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?parentnav=FAQS_BYTOPIC&amp;FAQ_NAVIGATION_ID=ORGANIC_FQ&amp;FAQ_NAVIGATION_TYPE=FAQS_BYTOPIC&amp;contentid=faqdetail-3.xml&amp;edeployment_action=retrievecontent |archive-date=2015-10-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/issues/1050/sewage-sludge/how-do-i-know-if-my-food-was-grown-in-sewage-sludge# |title=Issues &amp;#124; Sewage Sludge &amp;#124; How Do I Know if My Food was Grown in Sewage Sludge? |publisher=Center for Food Safety |accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major differences in organic animal husbandry protocol is the "pasture rule":&lt;ref name="usda"/&gt; minimum requirements for time on pasture do vary somewhat by species and between the certifying agencies, but the common theme is to require as much time on pasture as possible and reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All differences in one table by EU regulation|url=http://organicrules.org/custom/differences.php?id=2g|publisher=ICROFS|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Access to pasture|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/nopaccesstopasture|publisher=USDA|accessdate=20 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822005418/http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/nopaccesstopasture|archivedate=22 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and safety==

There is little scientific evidence of benefit or harm to human health from a diet high in organic food, and conducting any sort of rigorous experiment on the subject is very difficult. A 2012 meta-analysis noted that "there have been no long-term studies of health outcomes of populations consuming predominantly organic versus conventionally produced food controlling for socioeconomic factors; such studies would be expensive to conduct."&lt;ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/&gt;  A 2009 meta-analysis noted that "most of the included articles did not study direct human health outcomes. In ten of the included studies (83%), a primary outcome was the change in antioxidant activity. Antioxidant status and activity are useful biomarkers but do not directly equate to a health outcome. Of the remaining two articles, one recorded proxy-reported measures of atopic manifestations as its primary health outcome, whereas the other article examined the fatty acid composition of breast milk and implied possible health benefits for infants from the consumption of different amounts of conjugated linoleic acids from breast milk."&lt;ref name=Dangour2009 /&gt;  In addition, as discussed above, difficulties in accurately and meaningfully measuring chemical differences between organic and conventional food make it difficult to extrapolate health recommendations based solely on chemical analysis.

As of 2012, the scientific consensus is that while "consumers may choose to buy organic fruit, vegetables and meat because they believe them to be more nutritious than other food.... the balance of current scientific evidence does not support this view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Food Standards Agency's Current Stance|url=http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/organicfood2.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331234955/http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/organicfood2.pdf|archivedate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence of beneficial health effects of organic food consumption is scarce, which has led researchers to call for more long-term studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hurtado-Barroso |first=Sara |last2=Tresserra-Rimbau |first2=Anna |last3=Vallverdú-Queralt |first3=Anna |last4=Lamuela-Raventós |first4=Rosa María |date=2017-11-30 |title=Organic food and the impact on human health |journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1080/10408398.2017.1394815 |issn=1549-7852 |pmid=29190113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, studies that suggest that organic foods may be healthier than conventional foods face significant methodological challenges, such as the correlation between organic food consumption and factors known to promote a healthy lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Brantsæter |first=Anne Lise |last2=Ydersbond |first2=Trond A. |last3=Hoppin |first3=Jane A. |last4=Haugen |first4=Margaretha |last5=Meltzer |first5=Helle Margrete |date=2017-03-20 |title=Organic Food in the Diet: Exposure and Health Implications|journal=Annual Review of Public Health |volume=38 |pages=295–313 |doi=10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031816-044437 |issn=1545-2093 |pmid=27992727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mie |first=Axel |last2=Andersen |first2=Helle Raun |last3=Gunnarsson |first3=Stefan |last4=Kahl |first4=Johannes |last5=Kesse-Guyot |first5=Emmanuelle |last6=Rembiałkowska |first6=Ewa |last7=Quaglio |first7=Gianluca |last8=Grandjean |first8=Philippe |date=2017-10-27 |title=Human health implications of organic food and organic agriculture: a comprehensive review |journal=Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=111 |doi=10.1186/s12940-017-0315-4 |issn=1476-069X |pmc=5658984 |pmid=29073935}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] reviewed the literature on organic foods in 2012, they found that "current evidence does not support any meaningful nutritional benefits or deficits from eating organic compared with conventionally grown foods, and there are no well-powered human studies that directly demonstrate health benefits or disease protection as a result of consuming an organic diet."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Forman |first=Joel |last2=Silverstein |first2=Janet |last3=Committee on Nutrition |last4=Council on Environmental Health |last5=American Academy of Pediatrics |date=November 2012 |title=Organic foods: health and environmental advantages and disadvantages |journal=Pediatrics |volume=130 |issue=5 |pages=e1406–1415 |doi=10.1542/peds.2012-2579 |issn=1098-4275 |pmid=23090335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumer safety===

====Pesticide exposure====
The main difference between organic and conventional food products are the chemicals involved during production and processing. The residues of those chemicals in food products have dubious effects on human health. All food products on the market including those that contain residues of pesticides, antibiotics, growth hormones and other types of chemicals that are used during production and processing are said to be safe.&lt;ref&gt;"Organic Food No More Nutritious than Non-organic: Study. Organic Food No More Nutritious than Non-organic: Study, 4 Sept.2012.Web.9 Nov.2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims of improved safety of organic food has largely focused on [[pesticide residue]]s.&lt;ref name=MagkosSafety2006 /&gt;  These concerns are driven by the facts that "(1) acute, massive exposure to pesticides can cause significant adverse health effects;

This possibility is practically impossible to study and quantify;" therefore firm conclusions about the relative safety of organic foods have been hampered by the difficulty in proper [[study design]] and relatively small number of studies directly comparing organic food to conventional food.&lt;ref name=Blair1/&gt;&lt;ref name=MagkosSafety2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bourn /&gt;&lt;ref name=Canavari2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Joseph D.|title=A Review of the Nutrition Claims Made by Proponents of Organic Food|journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety|date=May 2010|volume=9|issue=3|pages=270–277|doi=10.1111/j.1541-4337.2010.00108.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the Carcinogenic Potency Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://potency.berkeley.edu/index.html|title=The Carcinogenic Potency Project (CPDB)|author=|date=|website=potency.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a part of the US [[EPA]]'s Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) Database Network,&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT) [http://www.epa.gov/ncct/dsstox/ DSSTox Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; has been systemically testing the carcinogenicity of chemicals, both natural and synthetic, and building a publicly available database of the results&lt;ref&gt;[http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/html/cpdbfs.htm Publicly available Toxnet database from US NLM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218135909/http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/html/cpdbfs.htm |date=2013-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the past ~30 years.  Their work attempts to fill in the gaps in our scientific knowledge of the carcinogenicity of all chemicals, both natural and synthetic, as the scientists conducting the Project described in the journal, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', in 1992: &lt;blockquote&gt;Toxicological examination of synthetic chemicals, without similar examination of chemicals that occur naturally, has resulted in an imbalance in both the data on and the perception of chemical carcinogens. Three points that we have discussed indicate that comparisons should be made with natural as well as synthetic chemicals.&lt;br&gt;
1) The vast proportion of chemicals that humans are exposed to occur naturally. Nevertheless, the public tends to view chemicals as only synthetic and to think of synthetic chemicals as toxic despite the fact that every natural chemical is also toxic at some dose. The daily average exposure of Americans to burnt material in the diet is ~2000 mg, and exposure to natural pesticides (the chemicals that plants produce to defend themselves) is ~1500 mg. In comparison, the total daily exposure to all synthetic pesticide residues combined is ~0.09 mg. Thus, we estimate that 99.99% of the pesticides humans ingest are natural. Despite this enormously greater exposure to natural chemicals, 79% (378 out of 479) of the chemicals tested for carcinogenicity in both rats and mice are synthetic (that is, do not occur naturally). &lt;br&gt;
2) It has often been wrongly assumed that humans have evolved defenses against the natural chemicals in our diet but not against the synthetic chemicals. However, defenses that animals have evolved are mostly general rather than specific for particular chemicals; moreover, defenses are generally inducible and therefore protect well from low doses of both synthetic and natural chemicals.&lt;br&gt;
3) Because the toxicology of natural and synthetic chemicals is similar, one expects (and finds) a similar positivity rate for carcinogenicity among synthetic and natural chemicals. The positivity rate among chemicals tested in rats and mice is ~50%. Therefore, because humans are exposed to so many more natural than synthetic chemicals (by weight and by number), humans are exposed to an enormous background of rodent carcinogens, as defined by high-dose tests on rodents. We have shown that even though only a tiny proportion of natural pesticides in plant foods have been tested, the 29 that are rodent carcinogens among the 57 tested, occur in more than 50 common plant foods. It is probable that almost every fruit and vegetable in the supermarket contains natural pesticides that are rodent carcinogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gold L.S.| year = 1992 | title = Rodent carcinogens: Setting priorities | url = http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cpdb/pdfs/Science1992.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Science | volume = 258 | issue = 5080| pages = 261–265 | doi=10.1126/science.1411524|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While studies have shown via chemical analysis, as discussed above, that organically grown fruits and vegetables have significantly lower pesticide residue levels, the significance of this finding on actual health risk reduction is debatable as both conventional foods and organic foods generally have pesticide levels well below government established guidelines for what is considered safe.&lt;ref name=Blair1/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;ref name=MagkosSafety2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/&gt; This view has been echoed by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]&lt;ref name=USDA&gt;{{cite web|last=Gold |first=Mary |title=Should I Purchase Organic Foods? |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/pubs/faq/BuyOrganicFoodsC.shtml |publisher=USDA |accessdate=5 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721070355/http://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/pubs/faq/BuyOrganicFoodsC.shtml |archivedate=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK [[Food Standards Agency]].&lt;ref name=FSA&gt;{{cite web|title=Organic food|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605025656/http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/farmingfood/organicfood/|publisher=UK Food Standards Agency|archivedate=5 June 2011|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/farmingfood/organicfood/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] in 1993 determined that for infants and children, the major source of exposure to pesticides is through diet.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council.

In this study it was found that levels of organophosphorus pesticide exposure dropped from negligible levels to undetectable levels when the children switched to an organic diet, the authors presented this reduction as a significant reduction in risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=C|last2=Toepel|first2=K|last3=Irish|first3=R|last4=Fenske|first4=RA|last5=Barr|first5=DB|last6=Bravo|first6=R|title=Organic diets significantly lower children's dietary exposure to organophosphorus pesticides|pmid=16451864|volume=114|issue=2|pmc=1367841|date=February 2006|journal=Environ.

:* In 1987, the first Danish Action Plan was implemented which was meant to support and stimulate farmers to switch from conventional food production systems to organic ones . Since then Denmark has constantly worked on further developing the market by promoting organic food and keeping prices low in comparison to conventional food products by offering farmers subvention and extra support if they choose to produce organic food. Then and even today is the bench mark for organic food policy and certification of organic food in the whole world. The new European Organic food label and organic food policy was developed based on the 1987 Danish Model.&lt;ref&gt;Aschemann, J., U. Hamm, S. Naspetti, and R Zanoli"The Organic Market."

: '''Italy'''
:* Since 2000, the use of some organic food is compulsory in Italian schools and hospitals. A 2002 law of the [[Emilia Romagna]] region implemented in 2005, explicitly requires that the food in nursery and primary schools (from 3 months to 10 years) must be 100% organic, and the food in meals at schools, universities and hospitals must be at least 35% organic.

: '''Poland'''
:* In 2005 7 percent of Polish consumers buy food that was produced according to the EU-Eco-regulation. The value of the organic market is estimated at 50 million euros (2006).

: '''Romania'''
:* 70%–80% of the local organic production, amounting to 100 million euros in 2010, is exported. The organic products market grew to 50 million euros in 2010.

: '''Switzerland'''
:* {{as of|2012}}, 11 per cent of Swiss farms are organic. [[Bio Suisse]], the Swiss organic producers' association, provides guidelines for organic farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

: '''Ukraine'''
:*In 2009 Ukraine was in 21st place in the world by area under cultivation of organic food.

== History ==
Otherside Farms Cannabis Information Center was opened around 2010 by a [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]] couple, Alysha and Chadd McKeen, hoping their new "medical marijuana information center" would help dissolve stigmas associated with cannabis.&lt;ref name=bailey /&gt;

{{Quote|I want to tell people to stop being afraid of it," Chadd McKeen, co-founder of Otherside Farms, told the ''Daily Pilot''. We want to bring it out into the open.&lt;ref name=bailey /&gt;}} 

The McKeens had a personal incentive to teach people about the benefits of cannabis, as Alysha had gone through [[cancer]] with the help of the plant.&lt;ref name=coker&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2010-05-20/news/Otherside-farms-chadd-mckeen-medical-marijuana/|title=Growing Pains at Otherside Farms|last=Coker|first=Matt|date=20 May 2010|newspaper=Orange County News}}&lt;/ref&gt; City officials approved the location to be legal as long as cannabis was not distributed there.&lt;ref name=bailey /&gt;

== Raid ==
In late August 2011, Otherside Farms opened a private collective, maintaining it as a separate entity from Otherside Farms.&lt;ref name=otherside /&gt; On January 17, 2012, the private collective was raided by federal officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.dailypilot.com/2012-01-18/news/tn-dpt-0119-marijuana-20120118_1_marijuana-dispensaries-marijuana-plants-Otherside-farms|title=Authorities raid Costa Mesa marijuana dispensaries|last=Serna|first=Joseph|date=18 January 2012|newspaper=Daily Pilot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy ensued over the raid, as city officials had secretly authorized a letter seeking federal law enforcement assistance in shutting down the collective, which an expert claimed was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://Othersidefarms.com/blog/index.php/News/city-s-secrecy-on-pot-shop-was-illegal-experts-say|title=City's Secrecy on Pot Shop Letter Was Illegal, Expert Says|publisher=Otherside Farms|date=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basis for the raid was an accusation by a city inspector claiming that Chadd McKeen hoped to profit from his business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.ocweekly.com/navelgazing/2012/01/dea_raids_several_costa_mesa_m.php|title=DEA Raids Several Costa Mesa Marijuana Dispensaries|last=Schou|first=Nick|date=18 January 2012|newspaper=Orange County News}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKeen denied the accusation, stating that his words were misconstrued, and that Otherside Farms had been trying to communicate a plan to help resolve the Cosa Mesa [[budget deficit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://Othersidefarms.com/blog/index.php/Otherside-FARMS-in-the-NEWS/Otherside-farms-clarification-to-recent-press-coverage|title=Otherside Farms Clarification to Recent Press Coverage|publisher=Otherside Farms|date=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had been present since 2010, only for meeting requests to be turned down by city officials.&lt;ref name=coker /&gt;

'''Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc.''' ('''PPFA'''), or '''Planned Parenthood,''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] that provides [[Reproductive health|reproductive health care]] in the United States and globally. It is a tax-exempt corporation under [[Internal Revenue Code]] section [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/7413/9620/1089/AR-FY13_111213_vF_rev3_ISSUU.pdf Planned Parenthood Annual Report 2012–2013], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and a member association of the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] (IPPF). PPFA has its roots in [[Brooklyn]], New York, where [[Margaret Sanger]] opened the first [[birth control]] clinic in the U.S. in 1916. Sanger founded the [[American Birth Control League]] in 1921,&lt;ref name="ABCL 1921" /&gt; which changed its name to Planned Parenthood in 1942.

=== Origins ===

[[File:MargaretSanger-Underwood.LOC.jpg|thumb|right|[[Margaret Sanger]] (1922), the first president and founder of Planned Parenthood]]

The origins of Planned Parenthood date to October 16, 1916, when [[Margaret Sanger]], her sister [[Ethel Byrne]], and [[Fania Mindell]] opened the [[first birth control clinic in the U.S.]] in the [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]] section of the [[New York City|New York]] borough of [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name="goldberg 2012"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Goldberg |first1 = Michelle |title = Awakenings: On Margaret Sanger |url = http://www.thenation.com/article/awakenings-margaret-sanger/ |accessdate = November 5, 2015 |work = The Nation |date = February 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They distributed birth control, birth control advice, and birth control information. All three women were arrested&lt;ref name="arrest 1916"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://sangerpapers.wordpress.com/2012/10/26/anniversry-of-the-brownsville-clinic-raid/ |title = Anniversary of the Brownsville Clinic Raid |author = Esther Katz (poster) |date = October 26, 2012 |work = Margaret Sanger Papers Project~Research Annex |accessdate = March 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, Peter C.

The so-called Brownsville trials brought national attention and support to their cause. Sanger and her co-defendants were convicted on [[misdemeanor]] charges, which they appealed through two subsequent appeals courts. While the convictions were not overturned,&lt;ref name="people v sanger"&gt;"People v. Sanger", 179 App. Div. 939, 166 N.Y.S. 1107 (1917)&lt;/ref&gt; the judge who issued the final ruling also modified the law to permit physician-prescribed birth control. The women's campaign led to major changes in the laws governing birth control and sex education in the United States.&lt;ref name="socprobs"&gt;{{Citation |last = McVeigh |first = Frank |last2 = Loreen |first2 = Wolfer |title = Brief history of social problems: a critical thinking approach |publisher = [[University Press of America]] |year = 2004 |edition = Illustrated |isbn = 0-7618-2831-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, the clinic was organized into the [[American Birth Control League]],&lt;ref name="ABCL 1921"&gt;{{cite book |author = Kathryn Cullen-DuPont |title = Encyclopedia of women's history in America |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC&amp;pg=PA374 |accessdate = November 28, 2011 |date = August 1, 2000 |publisher = Infobase Publishing |isbn = 978-0-8160-4100-8 |page = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the core of the only national birth-control organization in the U.S. until the 1960s.

In 1942, the League officially changed its name to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.&lt;ref name="moralprop" /&gt;

Largely relying on a volunteer workforce, by 1960 the Federation had provided family planning counseling in hundreds of communities across the country.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; Planned Parenthood was one of the founding members of the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] when it was launched at a conference in [[Bombay]] (now Mumbai), [[India]], in 1952.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="malthus"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.academia.edu/28816392/_The_Hour_of_Malthus_Has_Struck_The_Foundation_of_the_International_Planned_Parenthood_Federation_and_Discourses_of_International_Family_Planning |title = "The Hour of Malthus Has Struck": The Foundation of the International Planned Parenthood Federation and Discourses of International Family Planning |author = Sara Weydner |date =  |work = academia.edu |accessdate = October 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Planned Parenthood and Margaret Sanger are strongly associated with the abortion issue today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/protect-womens-health/ |title = Political Attacks on Planned Parenthood Are a Threat to Women's Health |publisher = Scientific American |date =  |accessdate = January 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wayne"&gt;Wayne, T.

Following Margaret Sanger, [[Alan Frank Guttmacher]] became president of Planned Parenthood, serving from 1962 until 1974.&lt;ref name="guttmacher 1974"&gt;{{Citation |title = Alan Guttmacher |newspaper = [[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|The Toledo Blade]] |page = 28 |date = March 19, 1974 |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tfNOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KQIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=alan%20guttmacher&amp;pg=4125%2C1783215 |accessdate = February 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved the sale of the original [[birth control pill]], giving rise to new attitudes towards women's [[reproductive freedom]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; Also during his presidency, Planned Parenthood lobbied the federal government to support reproductive health, culminating with President [[Richard Nixon]]'s signing of [[Title X]] to provide governmental subsidies for low-income women to access family planning services.&lt;ref name="new-yorker-2011"&gt;{{cite journal |first = Jill |last = Lepore |authorlink = Jill Lepore |title = Birthright: What's next for Planned Parenthood? |journal = The New Yorker |date = November 14, 2011 |url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/11/14/111114fa_fact_lepore |accessdate = April 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for Family Planning Program Development was also founded as a semi-autonomous division during this time.&lt;ref name="gihistory"&gt;{{cite web |title = The History of the Guttmacher Institute |work = Official Website |publisher = [[Guttmacher Institute]] |url = http://www.guttmacher.org/about/history.html |accessdate = February 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The center became an independent organization and was renamed the [[Guttmacher Institute]] in 1977.&lt;ref name="gihistory" /&gt;

Planned Parenthood began to advocate abortion law reform beginning in 1955, when the organization's medical director, [[Mary Calderone]], convened a national conference of medical professionals on the issue. The conference was the first instance of physicians and other professionals advocating reform of the laws which criminalized abortion, and it played a key role in creating a movement for the reform of abortion laws in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Reagan"&gt;Reagan, Leslie J. 1997. When Abortion Was a Crime : Women, Medicine, and Law in the United States, 1867–1973. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing, at first, on legalizing [[therapeutic abortion]], Planned Parenthood became an increasingly vocal proponent of liberalized abortion laws during the 1960s, culminating in its call for the repeal of all anti-abortion laws in 1969.&lt;ref name="O'Connor2010"&gt;{{cite book |author = Karen O'Connor |title = Gender and Women's Leadership: A Reference Handbook |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-3J_3pDNZlkC&amp;pg=PA744 |year = 2010 |publisher = SAGE Reference |isbn = 978-1-4129-6083-0 |pages = 744– }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, the organization played a key role in landmark abortion rights cases such as ''[[Roe v. Wade|Roe v Wade]]'' (1973) and ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey|Planned Parenthood v Casey]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name="Wayne" /&gt;  Once abortion was legalized during the early 1970s, Planned Parenthood also began acting as an abortion provider.

[[Faye Wattleton]] became the first [[African American]] president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1978. Wattleton, who was also the youngest president in Planned Parenthood's history, served in this role until 1992.&lt;ref name="black history"&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Middleton |first1 = Britt |title = This Day in Black History: July 8, 1943 |url = http://www.bet.com/news/national/2013/07/08/this-day-in-black-history-july-8-1943.html |publisher = BET |accessdate = November 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = About Faye |publisher = Faye Wattleton |url = http://www.fayewattleton.com/about/ |accessdate = October 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During her term, Planned Parenthood grew to become the seventh largest charity in the country, providing services to four million clients each year through its 170 affiliates, whose activities were spread across 50 states.&lt;ref name="faye wattleton 2002"&gt;{{Citation |last = Marshall |first = Lauren |title = Women's Rights Advocate Faye Wattleton Elected Newest Columbia Trustee |newspaper = [[Columbia University|Columbia News]] |date = April 4, 2002 |url = http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/02/04/fayeWattleton.html |accessdate = February 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldt also launched the Responsible Choices Action Agenda, a nationwide campaign to increase services to prevent [[Unintended pregnancy|unwanted pregnancies]], improve quality of reproductive care, and ensure access to safe and legal abortions.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; Another initiative was the commencement of a "Global Partnership Program", with the aim of building a vibrant activist constituency in support of family planning.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;

On February 15, 2006, [[Cecile Richards]], the daughter of former Texas governor [[Ann Richards]], and formerly the deputy chief of staff to the U.S. Rep. [[Nancy Pelosi]] (the Democratic Leader in the [[United States House of Representatives]]), became president of the organization.&lt;ref name="cecile richards 2006"&gt;{{cite news |first = Darragh |last = Johnson |pages = C01 |title = Cecile Richards, Planned Parenthood's Choice Leader |date = March 25, 2006 |publisher = Washington Post |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/24/AR2006032402171.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Richards was voted one of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine's]] ''[[100 Most Influential People in the World]]''.&lt;ref name="time's 100"&gt;{{cite news |last = Fluke |first = Sandra |url = http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2111975_2111976_2111998,00.html |title = Time Magazine: 100 Most Influential People in the World: Cecile Richards |publisher = Time.com |date = April 18, 2012 |accessdate = April 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planned Parenthood has received federal funding since 1970, when President [[Richard Nixon]] signed into law the [[Family Planning Services and Population Research Act]], amending the [[Public Health Service Act]]. [[Title X]] of that law provides funding for family planning services, including contraception and family planning information.

Late in 2016, the Obama administration issued a rule effective in January 2017 banning U.S. states from withholding federal family-planning funds from health clinics that give abortions, including Planned Parenthood affiliates; this rule mandates that local and state governments give federal funds for services related to sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy care, fertility, contraception, and breast and cervical cancer screening to qualified health providers whether or not they give abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/us/politics/obama-administration-planned-parenthood.html |title = Obama Bars States From Denying Federal Money to Planned Parenthood |author =  |date = December 14, 2016 |publisher =  |accessdate = May 27, 2018 |via = NYTimes.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this rule was blocked by a federal judge the day before it would have taken effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Gorman |first = Steve |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-idUSKBN14L0OP |title = U.S. judge blocks transgender, abortion-related Obamacare protections |publisher = Reuters |date = December 31, 2016 |accessdate = January 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it was overturned by new legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-13/trump-moves-against-planned-parenthood-by-signing-gop-measure |title = Trump Moves Against Planned Parenthood by Signing GOP Bill |publisher = Bloomberg |date = 2017 |accessdate = April 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Before the U.S. Supreme Court ==

[[File:Roevwade.jpg|thumb|right|Former Planned Parenthood President [[Gloria Feldt]] with Congressman [[Albert Wynn]] in front of the U.S. Supreme Court]]

Planned Parenthood regional chapters have been active in the American courts. A number of cases in which Planned Parenthood has been a party have reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]. Notable among these cases is the 1992 case ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', the case that sets forth the current constitutional abortion standard. In this case, "Planned Parenthood" was the Southeast Pennsylvania Chapter, and "Casey" was [[Robert P. Casey|Robert Casey]], the governor of [[Pennsylvania]]. The ultimate ruling was split, and ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' was narrowed but upheld in an opinion written by [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], [[Anthony Kennedy]], and [[David Souter]]. [[Harry Blackmun]] and [[John Paul Stevens]] concurred with the main decision in separately written opinions. The Supreme Court struck down spousal consent requirements for married women to obtain abortions, but found no "undue burden"—an alternative to [[strict scrutiny]], which tests the allowable limitations on rights protected under the Constitution—from the other statutory requirements. Dissenting were [[William Rehnquist]], [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Clarence Thomas]], and [[Byron White]]. Blackmun, Rehnquist, and White were the only justices who voted on the original ''Roe v. Wade'' decision in 1973 who were still on the Supreme Court to rule on this case, and their votes on this case were consistent with their votes on the original decision that legalized abortion.&lt;ref name="penn v casey"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0505_0833_ZS.html |title = Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v.

In 2006, [[Kansas Attorney General]] [[Phill Kline]], a Republican, released some sealed patient records obtained from Planned Parenthood to the public.

In the 1920s, various theories of [[eugenics]] were popular among intellectuals in the U.S. (For example, 75% of colleges offered courses on eugenics.)&lt;ref name="sacred work"&gt;{{cite book |last = Davis |first = Tom |title = Sacred work: Planned Parenthood and its clergy alliances |year = 2005 |publisher = Rutgers University Press |page = 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her campaign to promote birth control, Sanger teamed with eugenics organizations such as the [[American Eugenics Society]], although she argued against many of their positions.&lt;ref name="woman of valor"&gt;{{cite book |last = Chesler |first = Ellen |title = Woman of Valor: Margaret Sanger and the Birth Control Movement in America |year = 2007 |publisher = Simon and Schuster |pages = 195, 216–217, 343, 490 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="selected papers"&gt;{{cite book |title = The selected papers of Margaret Sanger, Volume 1 |year = 2003 |publisher = University of Illinois Press |page = 274 |editor = Esther Katz |display-editors = etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars describe Sanger as believing that birth control and sterilization should be voluntary, and not based on race.&lt;ref name="foes of abortion"&gt;{{cite news |last = Daiwan |first = Shaila |title = To Court Blacks, Foes of Abortion Make Racial Case |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/us/27race.html?sq=to%20court%20blacks,%20foes%20of%20abortion&amp;st=cse&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;scp=1&amp;adxnnlx=1312626120-SuELxigypPf+xAK5HJLHcw |accessdate = August 6, 2011 |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date = February 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger advocated for "voluntary motherhood"—the right to choose when to be pregnant—for all women, as an important element of [[women's rights]].&lt;ref name="bc politics"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=it1LHbLKVpkC&amp;pg=PA10 |page = 10 |title = Birth Control, Politics in the United States, 1916–1945 |last = McCann |first = Carole R. |authorlink = Carole McCann |year = 1999 |publisher = Cornell University Press |isbn = 978-0-8014-8612-8 |accessdate = October 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-3J_3pDNZlkC&amp;pg=PA751 |page = 751 |title = Gender and Women's Leadership: A Reference Handbook |volume = 1 |last = McCann |first = Carole R. |authorlink = Carole McCann |chapter = Women as Leaders in the Contraceptive Movement |editor = Karen O'Connor |publisher = SAGE |year = 2010 |isbn = 978-1-4129-6083-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of her efforts to promote birth control, however, Sanger found common cause with proponents of eugenics, believing that she and they both sought to "assist the race toward the elimination of the unfit".&lt;ref name="engelman 2010"&gt;Peter Engelman – ''A History of Birth Control in America'', Prager, New York, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Planned Parenthood often refer to Sanger's connection with supporters of eugenics to discredit the organization by associating it, and birth control, with the more negative modern view of eugenics.&lt;ref name="a racist"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Valenza |first = Charles |title = Was Margaret Sanger a Racist? |journal = Family Planning Perspectives |date = January–February 1985 |volume = 17 |issue = 1 |pages = 44–46 |url = http://chaztv.squarespace.com/storage/Margaret%20Sanger%20CV.pdf |accessdate = August 6, 2011 |pmid = 3884362 |doi = 10.2307/2135230 |jstor = 2135230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bomberger again"&gt;{{cite news |last = Chamlee |first = Virginia |title = Bomberger again lashes out at NPR, Veazey |url = http://floridaindependent.com/40946/bomberger-again-lashes-out-at-npr-veazey |accessdate = August 6, 2011 |newspaper = The Florida Independent |date = July 27, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110911154543/http://floridaindependent.com/40946/bomberger-again-lashes-out-at-npr-veazey |archive-date = September 11, 2011 |dead-url = yes |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Planned Parenthood has responded to this effort directly in a leaflet acknowledging that Sanger agreed with some of her contemporaries who advocated the voluntary hospitalization or sterilization of people with untreatable, disabling, hereditary conditions, and limits on the immigration of the diseased. The leaflet also states that Planned Parenthood "finds these views objectionable and outmoded" but says that it was compelled to discuss the topic because "anti-family planning activists continue to attack Sanger{{nbsp}}[...] because she is an easier target" than Planned Parenthood.&lt;ref name="opposition claims"&gt;{{cite web |title = Opposition Claims About Margaret Sanger |url = https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/8013/9611/6937/Opposition_Claims_About_Margaret_Sanger.pdf |publisher = Planned Parenthood |accessdate = November 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abortion ===

Planned Parenthood has occupied a central position in the [[abortion debate]] in the U.S., and has been among the most prominent targets of the [[United States pro-life movement|U.S. pro-life movement]] for decades. Some members of Congress, overwhelmingly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], have attempted since the 1980s to end federal funding of the organization,&lt;ref name="thorn" /&gt; nearly leading to a government shutdown over the issue in 2011.&lt;ref name="budget shutdown"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Dwyer |first1 = Devin |title = Planned Parenthood at Center of Budget Shutdown Threat |url = http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/planned-parenthood-center-budget-shutdown-threat/story?id=13328750 |accessdate = March 5, 2015 |publisher = ABC News |date = April 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Planned Parenthood has consistently maintained that federal money received by Planned Parenthood is not used to fund abortion services, but pro-life activists have argued that the federal funding frees up other resources that are, in turn, used to provide abortions.&lt;ref name="thorn" /&gt;

Planned Parenthood is the largest single provider of abortions in the U.S.,&lt;ref name="yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/planned-parenthood-abortion-and-the-budget-fight/ |title = Planned Parenthood, abortion and the budget fight |work = Seattle Times |date = April 8, 2011 |accessdate = November 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Abortion-rights movements|pro-choice]] advocates have argued that the organization's family planning services reduce the need for abortions; in the words of Megan Crepeau of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Planned Parenthood could be "characterized as America's largest abortion preventer".&lt;ref name="bait and switch"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-04-04/news/ct-oped-0404-reproduction-20110404_1_fiscal-responsibility-cervical-cancer-screenings-planned-parenthood |title = The great Republican bait-and-switch |last = Crepeau |first = Megan |date = April 4, 2011 |work = Chicago Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="texas says"&gt;* Finn, Robin, "Anti-Abortion Advocates? Bring 'Em On, Texan Says", ''The New York Times'', March 10, 2006. Quote: "PLANNED PARENTHOOD serves five million Americans and concentrates 90 percent of its efforts on preventing unwanted pregnancies, Ms.{{nbsp}}Richards, says, not terminating them. 'No one does more to reduce the need for abortions in this country than Planned Parenthood.'"[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/10/nyregion/10lives.html]
* Also, Emily Stewart, director of public policy for Planned Parenthood said: "Without a doubt, when women have access to birth control, it reduces unintended pregnancies" [http://www.vpr.net/npr/140156682/]&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-life activists dispute the evidence that greater access to contraceptives reduces abortion frequency.&lt;ref name="step up attacks"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Rovner |first1 = Julie |title = Conservatives Step Up Attacks On Public Funding For Birth Control |url = https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2011/09/07/140156682/conservatives-step-up-attacks-on-public-funding-for-birth-control |accessdate = July 21, 2015 |publisher = NPR |date = September 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Undercover videos by anti-abortion activists ====
{{anchor|Undercover recordings by pro-life activists}}

Periodically, pro-life advocates and activists have tried to demonstrate that Planned Parenthood does not follow applicable state or federal laws. The groups called or visited Planned Parenthood health centers posing as victims of [[statutory rape]],&lt;ref name="undercover sting 2002"&gt;{{cite news |title = Pro-Life Group Launches Undercover Sting |url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,54079,00.html |publisher = [[Fox News Channel]] |date = May 31, 2002 |accessdate = March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; minors who by law need parental notification before abortion,&lt;ref name="tactics"&gt;{{cite news |last = Mieszkowski |first = Katharine |title = Abortion foes' dirty tactics: Advocates of a California "parental notification" bill accuse Planned Parenthood of protecting sexual predators instead of teen girls.

'''Raymond Bernard Cattell''' (20 March 1905 – 2 February 1998) was a British and American [[psychology|psychologist]], known for his psychometric research into intrapersonal psychological structure.&lt;ref name="Gillis, J."&gt;Gillis, J.

Cattell was an early proponent of using [[factor analysis|factor analytic methods]] instead of what he called "subjective verbal theorizing" to explore empirically the basic dimensions of personality, motivation, and cognitive abilities. One of the results of Cattell's application of factor analysis was his discovery of 16 separate primary trait factors within the normal personality sphere (based on the trait lexicon).&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. &amp; Kline, P. (1977)."&gt;Cattell, R. B. &amp; Kline, P. (1977). ''The Scientific Analysis of Personality and Motivation''. New York: Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; He called these factors "source traits".&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1973). Personality"&gt;Cattell, R. B. (1973). ''Personality and Mood by Questionnaire''. San Francisco: CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory of personality factors and the self-report instrument used to measure them are known respectively as the [[16 Personality Factors|16 personality factor model]] and the [[16PF Questionnaire]] (16PF).&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R. B., Eber, H. W., &amp; Tatsuoka, M. M. (1970). ''Handbook for the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire'' (16PF). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattell also undertook a series of empirical studies into the basic dimensions of other psychological domains: [[intelligence]],&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R. B. (1982). ''The Inheritance of Personality and Ability: Research Methods and Findings''. New York: Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; [[motivation]],&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. &amp; Child, D. (1975)."&gt;Cattell, R.

Career assessment and the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire. ''Journal of Career Assessment, 3''(2), 157-175.&lt;/ref&gt; Cattell theorized the existence of [[fluid and crystallized intelligence]] to explain human cognitive ability,&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B.

Boston, MA:: Houghton-Miffin.&lt;/ref&gt; and constructed the [[Cattell Culture Fair III|Culture Fair Intelligence Test]] to minimize the bias of written language and cultural background in intelligence testing.&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R. B. &amp; Cattell, A. K. S. (1973). ''Measuring Intelligence with the Culture Fair Tests''. Champaign, IL: IPAT.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovations and accomplishments==
Cattell's research was mainly in personality, abilities, motivations, and innovative multivariate research methods and statistical analysis (especially his many refinements to exploratory factor analytic methodology).&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1978)."/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R. B. (1984). The voyage of a laboratory, 1928-1984. ''Multivariate Experimental Research, 19'', 121-174.&lt;/ref&gt; In his personality research, he is best remembered for his factor-analytically derived [[16 Personality Factors|16-factor model of normal personality structure]],&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1983)."/&gt; arguing for this model over Eysenck's simpler higher-order 3-factor model, and constructing measures of these primary factors in the form of the 16PF Questionnaire (and its downward extensions: HSPQ, and CPQ, respectively).&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1973). Personality"/&gt; He was the first to propose a hierarchical, multi-level model of personality with the many basic primary factors at the first level and the fewer, broader, "second-order" factors at a higher stratum of personality organization.&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R. B. (1943). The description of personality: I. Foundations of trait measurement. ''Psychological Review, 50'', 559-594.&lt;/ref&gt; These "global trait" constructs are the precursors of the currently popular [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] (FFM) model of personality.&lt;ref name="Goldberg, L. R. (1993)."&gt;Goldberg, L. R. (1993). The structure of phenotypic personality traits. ''American Psychologist, 48''(1), 26-34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCrae, R. R. &amp; Costa, P. T.

(Eds.), ''The SAGE Handbook of Personality Theory and Assessment: Vol. 1 - Personality Theories and Models'' (pp. 273-294). Los Angeles, CA: Sage. {{ISBN|1-4129-2365-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1995)."&gt;Cattell, R. B. (1995). The fallacy of five factors in the personality sphere.

Boyle et al.(Eds.), ''The SAGE Handbook of Personality Theory and Assessment: Vol. 1 - Personality Theories and Models''. Los Angeles, CA: Sage. {{ISBN|1-4129-2365-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cattell's research led to further advances, such as distinguishing between state and trait measures (e.g., state-trait anxiety),&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R. B., &amp; Scheier, I. H. (1961). ''The Meaning and Measurement of Neuroticism and Anxiety''. New York: Ronald Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ranging on a continuum from immediate transitory emotional states, through longer-acting mood states, dynamic motivational traits, and also relatively enduring personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G. J., Saklofske, D. H., &amp; Matthews, G. (2015). (Eds.), ''Measures of Personality and Social Psychological Constructs'' (Ch. 8). Amsterdam: Elsevier/Academic. {{ISBN|978-0-12-386915-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cattell also conducted empirical studies into developmental changes in personality trait constructs across the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;Nesselroade, J. R. (1984). Concepts of intraindividual variability and change: Impressions of Cattell's influence on lifespan developmental psychology. ''Multivariate Behavioral Research, 19'', 269-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cognitive abilities domain, Cattell researched a wide range of abilities, but is best known for the distinction between [[fluid and crystallized intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1963)."/&gt; He distinguished between the abstract, adaptive, biologically-influenced cognitive abilities that he called "fluid intelligence" and the applied, experience-based and learning-enhanced ability that he called "crystallized intelligence."  Thus, for example, a mechanic who has worked on airplane engines for 30 years might have a huge amount of "crystallized" knowledge about the workings of these engines, while a new young engineer with more "fluid intelligence" might focus more on the theory of engine functioning, these two types of abilities might complement each other and work together toward achieving a goal.  As a foundation for this distinction, Cattell developed the investment-model of ability, arguing that crystallized ability emerged from the investment of fluid ability in a particular topic of knowledge. He contributed to [[cognitive epidemiology]] with his theory that crystallized knowledge, while more applied, could be maintained or even increase after fluid ability begins to decline with age, a concept used in the [[National Adult Reading Test]] (NART). Cattell constructed a number of ability tests, including the Comprehensive Ability Battery (CAB) that provides measures of 20 primary abilities,&lt;ref&gt;Hakstian, A. R. &amp; Cattell, R. B. (1982). ''Manual for the Comprehensive Ability Battery''. Champaign, IL: IPAT.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cattell Culture Fair III|Culture Fair Intelligence Test]] (CFIT) which was designed to provide a completely non-verbal measure of intelligence like that now seen in the [[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven's]]. The Culture Fair Intelligence Scales were intended to minimize the influence of cultural or educational background on the results of intelligence tests.&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R. B. &amp; Cattell, A. K. S. (1977). ''Measuring Intelligence with the Culture Fair Tests''. Champaign, IL: IPAT.&lt;/ref&gt;

In regard to statistical methodology, in 1960 Cattell founded the [[Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology]] (SMEP), and its journal ''Multivariate Behavioral Research'', in order to bring together, encourage, and support scientists interested in multi-variate research.&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1990)."&gt;Cattell, R. B. (1990). The birth of the society of multivariate experimental psychology. ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 26'', 48-57.&lt;/ref&gt; He was an early and frequent user of [[factor analysis]] (a statistical procedure for finding underlying factors in data). Cattell also developed new factor analytic techniques, for example, by inventing the Scree Test, which uses the curve of latent roots to judge the optimal number of factors to extract.&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1966). The Scree Test"&gt;Cattell, R. B. (1966). The Scree Test for the number of factors. ''Multivariate Behavioral Research, 1''(2), 245-276.&lt;/ref&gt; He also developed a new factor analysis rotation procedure—the "Procrustes" or non-orthogonal rotation, designed to let the data itself determine the best location of factors, rather than requiring orthogonal factors. Additional contributions include the Coefficient of Profile Similarity (taking account of shape, scatter, and level of two score profiles); P-technique factor analysis based on repeated measurements of a single individual (sampling of variables, rather than sampling of persons); dR-technique factor analysis for elucidating change dimensions (including transitory emotional states, and longer-lasting mood states); the Taxonome program for ascertaining the number and contents of clusters in a data set; the Rotoplot program for attaining maximum simple structure factor pattern solutions.&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1978)."/&gt; As well, he put forward the Dynamic Calculus for assessing interests and motivation,&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. &amp; Child, D. (1975)."/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G. J. (1988). Elucidation of motivation structure by dynamic calculus. In J.R. Nesselroade &amp; R.B. Cattell (Eds.), ''Handbook of Multivariate Experimental Psychology'' (2nd ed., pp. 737-787). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; the Basic Data Relations Box (assessing dimensions of experimental designs),&lt;ref name="Nesselroade, J. R. &amp; Cattell, R. B. (1988)."&gt;Nesselroade, J.

B. (1979, 1980). ''Personality and Learning Theory'', Vols. 1 &amp; 2. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Lee J. Cronbach]] at [[Stanford University]] stated:

"The thirty-year evolution of the data box and related methodology fed on bold conjecture, self-criticism, unbridled imagination, rational comparison of models in the abstract, and responsiveness to the nasty surprises of data. The story epitomizes scientific effort at its best. (p.240)"&lt;ref&gt;Cronbach, L. J. (1984). A research worker's treasure chest. ''Multivariate Behavioral Research, 19'', 223-240.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===England===
Raymond Cattell was born on 20 March 1905 in [[Hill Top, West Midlands|Hill Top]], West Bromwich, a small town in England near [[Birmingham]] where his father's family was involved in inventing new parts for engines, automobiles and other machines. Thus, his growing up years were a time when great technological and scientific ideas and advances were taking place and this greatly influenced his perspective on how a few people could actually make a difference in the world. He wrote: "1905 was a felicitous year in which to be born. The airplane was just a year old. The Curies and Rutherford in that year penetrated the heart of the atom and the mystery of its radiations, [[Alfred Binet]] launched the first intelligence test, and [[Einstein]], the theory of relativity.&lt;ref name="Gillis, J."/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Child, D. (1998). Obituary: Raymond Bernard Cattell (1905-1998), ''British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology, 51'', 353-357.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Cattell was about five years old, his family moved to Torquay, [[Devon]], in the south-west of England, where he grew up with strong interests in science and spent a lot of time sailing around the coastline. He was the first of his family (and the only one in his generation) to attend university: in 1921, he was awarded a scholarship to study chemistry at [[King's College, London]], where he obtained a B.Sc.(Hons) degree with 1st-class honors at age 19 years.&lt;ref name="Gillis, J."/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horn, J. L. (1998). Introduction of Raymond B. Cattell. In J.J. McArdle &amp; R.W.Woodcock (Eds.), ''Human Cognitive Abilities in Theory and Practice''. (p.25)&lt;/ref&gt; While studying physics and chemistry at university he learned from influential people in many other fields, who visited or lived in London. He writes: "[I] browsed far outside science in my reading and attended public lectures - [[Bertrand Russell]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Julian Huxley|Huxley]], and [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]] being my favorite speakers (the last, in a meeting at King's College, converted me to vegetarianism - for almost two years!" (p.64).&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1973)."&gt;Cattell, R. B. (1973). Autobiography. In G. Lindsey (Ed.), ''A History of Psychology in Autobiography'' (Vol. VI). New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt;

As he observed first-hand the terrible destruction and suffering after [[World War I]], Cattell was increasingly attracted to the idea of applying the tools of science to the serious human problems that he saw around him. He stated that in the cultural upheaval after WWI, he felt that his laboratory table had begun to seem too small and the world's problems so vast.&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1973)."/&gt; Thus, he decided to change his field of study and pursue a [[Ph.D]] in psychology at [[King's College, London]], which he received in 1929. The title of his Ph.D dissertation was "The Subjective Character of Cognition and Pre-Sensational Development of Perception". His Ph.D advisor at King's College, London, was [[Francis Aveling]], D.D., D.Sc., Ph.D., D.Litt., who was also President of the [[British Psychological Society]] from 1926 until 1929.&lt;ref name="Gillis, J."/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Child, D. (1998). Obituary: Raymond Bernard Cattell (1905-1998). ''British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology, 51'', 353-357. (see p.354)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheehy, N. (2004).

B. (Oct. 1941). Obituary: Francis Aveling: 1875-1941. ''American Journal of Psychology, 54''(4), 608–610.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Cattell was honored for his outstanding contributions to psychological research with conferral of the prestigious higher doctorate - D.Sc. from the University of London.&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1990)."/&gt;

While working on his Ph.D., Cattell had accepted a position teaching and counseling in the Department of Education at [[University of Exeter|Exeter University]].&lt;ref name="Gillis, J."/&gt; He ultimately found this disappointing because there was limited opportunity to conduct research.&lt;ref name="Gillis, J."/&gt; Cattell did his graduate work with [[Charles Spearman]], the English psychologist and statistician who is famous for his pioneering work on assessing intelligence, including the development of the idea of a general factor of intelligence termed ''[[General intelligence|g]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality: Classic Theories and Modern Research|last=Friedman|first=Howard S.|last2=Schustack|first2=Miriam W.|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2016|edition=6th|pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his three years at Exeter, Cattell courted and married Monica Rogers, whom he had known since his boyhood in [[Devon]] and they had a son together. She left him about four years later.&lt;ref name=Tucker/&gt; Soon afterward he moved to [[Leicester]] where he organized one of England's first child guidance clinics. It was also in this time period that he finished his first book "Under Sail Through Red Devon," which described his many adventures sailing around the coastline and estuaries of South Devon and Dartmoor.&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1973)."/&gt;

===United States===
In 1937, Cattell left England and moved to the United States when he was invited by [[Edward Thorndike]] to come to [[Columbia University]]. When the [[G. Stanley Hall]] professorship in psychology became available at [[Clark University]] in 1938, Cattell was recommended by Thorndike and was appointed to the position. However, he conducted little research there and was "continually depressed."&lt;ref name=Tucker/&gt; Cattell was invited by [[Gordon Allport]] to join the [[Harvard University]] faculty in 1941. While at Harvard he began some of the research in personality that would become the foundation for much of his later scientific work.&lt;ref name="Gillis, J."/&gt;

During [[World War II]], Cattell served as a civilian consultant to the U.S. government researching and developing tests for selecting officers in the armed forces. Cattell returned to teaching at [[Harvard]] and married Alberta Karen Schuettler, a Ph.D student in [[mathematics]] at [[Radcliffe College]]. Over the years, she worked with Cattell on many aspects of his research, writing, and test development. They had three daughters and a son.&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1973)."/&gt; They divorced in 1980.&lt;ref name=Tucker/&gt;

[[Herbert Woodrow]], professor of psychology at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], was searching for someone with a background in multivariate methods to establish a research laboratory. Cattell was invited to assume this position in 1945. With this newly created research professorship in psychology, he was able to obtain sufficient grant support for two Ph.D. associates, four graduate research assistants, and clerical assistance.&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1973)."/&gt;

One reason that Cattell moved to the [[University of Illinois]] was because the first electronic computer built and owned entirely by a US educational institution - "[[ILLIAC I|Illinois Automatic Computer]]" - was being developed there, which made it possible for him to complete large-scale factor analyses. Cattell founded the Laboratory of Personality Assessment and Group Behavior.&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1973)."/&gt; In 1949, he and his wife founded the Institute for Personality and Ability Testing (IPAT). Karen Cattell served as director of IPAT until 1993. Cattell remained in the Illinois research professorship until he reached the university's mandatory retirement age in 1973.  A few years after he retired from the University of Illinois he built a home in [[Boulder, Colorado]], where he wrote and published the results of a variety of research projects that had been left unfinished in Illinois.&lt;ref name="Gillis, J."/&gt;

In 1977, Cattell moved to Hawaii, largely because of his love of the ocean and sailing.  He continued his career as a part-time professor and adviser at the [[University of Hawaii]]. He also served as adjunct faculty of the Hawaii School of Professional Psychology. After settling in Hawaii he married Heather Birkett, a [[clinical psychologist]], who later carried out extensive research using the 16PF and other tests.&lt;ref&gt;Birkett-Cattell, H. (1989).

Champaign, IL: IPAT.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the last two decades of his life in Hawaii, Cattell continued to publish a variety of scientific articles, as well as books on motivation, the scientific use of factor analysis, two volumes of personality and learning theory, the inheritance of personality, and co-edited a book on functional psychological testing, as well as a complete revision of his highly renowned ''Handbook of Multivariate Experimental Psychology''.&lt;ref name="Nesselroade, J. R. &amp; Cattell, R. B. (1988)."/&gt;

Cattell and Heather Birkett Cattell lived on a lagoon in the southeast corner of [[Oahu]] where he kept a small sailing boat. Around 1990, he had to give up his sailing career because of navigational challenges resulting from old age. He died at home in [[Honolulu]] on 2 February 1998, at age 92 years. He is buried in the Valley of the Temples on a hillside overlooking the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stu.ca/~jgillis/cattell.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050328192418/http://www.stu.ca/~jgillis/cattell.html |archivedate=28 March 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His will provided for his remaining funds to build a school for underprivileged children in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cattell.net/devon/rbcschool.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He was an agnostic.&lt;ref name="Gillis, J."/&gt;

==Scientific orientation==
When Cattell entered the fledgling field of psychology in the 1920s, he felt that the domain of personality was dominated by speculative ideas that were largely intuitive with little/no empirical research basis.&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1983)."/&gt; Cattell accepted [[E.L. Thorndike]]’s empiricist viewpoint that "If something actually did exist, it existed in some amount and hence could be measured.".&lt;ref&gt;Thorndike, E. L. (1932), ''The Fundamentals of Learning'', AMS Press Inc., {{ISBN|0-404-06429-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattell found that constructs used by early psychological theorists tended to be somewhat subjective and poorly defined. For example, after examining over 400 published papers on the topic of "anxiety" in 1965, Cattell stated: "The studies showed so many fundamentally different meanings used for anxiety and different ways of measuring it, that the studies could not even be integrated.".&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R. B. (1965). ''The Scientific Analysis of Personality'' (p.55). Baltimore, MD: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early personality theorists tended to provide little objective evidence or research bases for their theories.  Cattell wanted psychology to become more like other sciences, whereby a theory could be tested in an objective way that could be understood and replicated by others. In Cattell's words:

:"Psychology appeared to be a jungle of confusing, conflicting, and arbitrary concepts.  These pre-scientific theories doubtless contained insights which still surpass in refinement those depended upon by psychiatrists or psychologists today.  But who knows, among the many brilliant ideas offered, which are the true ones?  Some will claim that the statements of one theorist are correct, but others will favour the views of another.  Then there is no objective way of sorting out the truth except through scientific research."&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R. B. (1965). ''The Scientific Analysis of Personality'' (p.14). Baltimore, MD: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emeritus Professor Arthur B. Sweney, an expert in psychometric test construction,&lt;ref&gt;Sweney, A. B., &amp; Cattell, R. B. (1962). Relationships between integrated and unintegrated motivation structure examined by objective tests. ''Journal of Social Psychology, 57'', 217-226.&lt;/ref&gt; summed up Cattell’s methodology:

:"[Cattell] was without exception the one man who made the most major strides in systematizing the field of behavioral science from all of its diverse facets into a real science based on empirical, replicable and universal principles. Seldom has psychology had such a determined, systematic explorer dedicated not only to the basic search for scientific knowledge but also to the need to apply science for the benefit of all." [https://web.archive.org/web/20080131080507/http://www.stu.ca/~jgillis/triswe.htm]

Also, according to Sheehy (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;62),

:"Cattell made fundamental contributions to our understanding of ability and the structure of personality."&lt;ref name="Sheehy, N. (2004)."&gt;Sheehy, N. (2004). ''Fifty Key Thinkers in Psychology'' (p.62). London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-203-44765-4}}; {{ISBN|0-203-75589-8}}; {{ISBN|0-415-16774-4}}; {{ISBN|0-415-16775-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Cattell was one of 52 signatories on "[[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]],&lt;ref name="gottfredson"&gt;Gottfredson, L. (December 13, 1994). [[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]]. ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', p. A18.(reprinted in ''Intelligence, 1997, 24''(1), 13-23)&lt;/ref&gt;" an editorial written by [[Linda Gottfredson]] and published in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on IQ research following the publication of the book ''[[The Bell Curve]]''.

==Multivariate research==
Rather than pursue a "univariate" research approach to psychology, studying the effect that a single variable (such as "dominance") might have on another variable (such as "decision-making"), Cattell pioneered the use of multivariate experimental psychology (the analysis of several variables simultaneously).&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1966)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nesselroade, J. R. &amp; Cattell, R. B. (1988)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheehy, N. (2004)."/&gt; He believed that behavioral dimensions were too complex and interactive to fully understand variables in isolation. The classical univariate approach required bringing the individual into an artificial laboratory situation and measuring the effect of one particular variable on another - also known as the "bivariate" approach, while the multivariate approach allowed psychologists to study the whole person and their unique combination of traits within a natural environmental context. Multivariate experimental research designs and multivariate statistical analyses allowed for the study of "real-life" situations (e.g., depression, divorce, loss) that could not be manipulated in an artificial laboratory environment.&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1990)."/&gt;

Cattell applied multivariate research methods across several intrapersonal psychological domains: the trait constructs (both normal and abnormal) of personality, motivational or dynamic traits, emotional and mood states, as well as the diverse array of cognitive abilities.&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. &amp; Kline, P. (1977)."/&gt; In each of these domains, he considered there must be a finite number of basic, unitary dimensions that could be identified empirically.  He drew a comparison between these fundamental, underlying (source) traits and the basic dimensions of the physical world that were discovered and presented, for example, in the periodic table of chemical elements.&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1973). Personality"/&gt;

In 1960, Cattell organized and convened an international symposium to increase communication and cooperation among researchers who were using [[multivariate statistics]] to study human behavior.  This resulted in the foundation of the [[Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology]] (SMEP) and its flagship journal, ''Multivariate Behavioral Research''. He brought many researchers from Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America to work in his lab at the University of Illinois.&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1990)."/&gt;  Many of his books involving multivariate experimental research were written in collaboration with notable colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''The Meaning and Measurement of Neuroticism and Anxiety'' (1961) with Ivan Scheier, ''Objective Personality and Motivation Tests'' (1967) with Frank Warburton, ''The Prediction of Achievement and Creativity''(1968) with Jim Butcher, ''Handbook of the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire'' (1970) with Herbert Eber and Maurice Tatsuoka, ''Cross-Cultural Comparison'' (USA, Japan, Austria) ''of Personality Structure in Objective Tests'' (1973), with Kurt Pawlik and Bien Tsujioka, ''Motivation and Dynamic Structure'' (1975) with Dennis Child, ''Handbook of Modern Personality Theory'' (1977) with Ralph Dreger, ''The Scientific Analysis of Personality and Motivation'' (1977) with Paul Kline, ''Personality Theory in Action: Handbook for the Objective-Analytic (O-A) Test Kit'' (1978) with James Schuerger, ''Functional Psychological Testing'' (1986) with Ronald Johnson, the ''Handbook of Multivariate Experimental Psychology'' (1988) (Rev. 2nd ed.) with John Nesselroade, and ''The 16PF: Personality in Depth'' (1989) with Heather Birkett.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factor analysis==
Cattell noted that in the hard sciences such as chemistry, physics, astronomy, as well as in medical science, unsubstantiated theories were historically widespread until new instruments were developed to improve scientific observation and measurement. In the 1920s, Cattell worked with [[Charles Spearman]] who was developing the new statistical technique of [[factor analysis]] in his effort to understand the basic dimensions and structure of human abilities.  Factor analysis became a powerful tool to help uncover the basic dimensions underlying a confusing array of surface variables within a particular domain.&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1978)."/&gt;

Factor analysis was built upon the earlier development of the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]], which provides a numerical estimate of the degree to which variables are "co-related".  For example, if "frequency of exercise" and "blood pressure level" were measured on a large group of people, then intercorrelating these two variables would provide a quantitative estimate of the degree to which "exercise" and "blood pressure" are directly related to each other. Factor analysis performs complex calculations on the correlation coefficients among the variables within a particular domain (such as cognitive ability or personality trait constructs) to determine the basic, unitary factors underlying the particular domain.&lt;ref&gt;McArdle, J. J. (1984). Cattell's contributions to structural equation modeling. ''Multivariate Experimental Psychology, 19'', 245-267.&lt;/ref&gt;

While working at the University of London with Spearman exploring the number and nature of human abilities, Cattell postulated that factor analysis could be applied to other areas beyond the domain of abilities.  In particular, Cattell was interested in exploring the basic taxonomic dimensions and structure of human personality.&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. &amp; Kline, P. (1977)."/&gt; He believed that if exploratory factor analysis were applied to a wide range of measures of interpersonal functioning, the basic dimensions within the domain of social behavior could be identified.  Thus, factor analysis could be used to discover the fundamental dimensions underlying the large number of surface behaviors, thereby facilitating more effective research.

As noted above, Cattell made many important innovative contributions to factor analytic methodology, including the Scree Test to estimate the optimal number of factors to extract,&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1966). The Scree Test"/&gt; the "Procrustes" oblique rotation strategy, the Coefficient of Profile Similarity, P-technique factor analysis, dR-technique factor analysis, the Taxonome program, as well the Rotoplot program for attaining maximum simple structure solutions.&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1978)."/&gt; In addition, many eminent researchers received their grounding in factor analytic methodology under the guidance of Cattell, including Richard Gorsuch, an authority on exploratory factor analytic methods.&lt;ref&gt;Gorsuch, R. L. (1983). ''Factor analysis''. (Rev. 2nd ed.). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0898592023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality theory==
In order to apply factor analysis to personality, Cattell believed it was necessary to sample the widest possible range of variables.  He specified three kinds of data for comprehensive sampling, to capture the full range of personality dimensions:
# '''Life data (or L-data),''' which involves collecting data from the individual’s natural, everyday life behaviors, measuring their characteristic behavior patterns in the real world.  This could range from number of traffic accidents or number of parties attended each month, to grade point average in school or number of illnesses or divorces.
# '''Experimental data (or T-data)''' which involves reactions to standardized experimental situations created in a lab where a subject’s behavior can be objectively observed and measured.
# '''Questionnaire data (or Q-data),''' which involves responses based on introspection by the individual about their own behavior and feelings.  He found that this kind of direct questioning often measured subtle internal states and viewpoints that might be hard to see or measure in external behavior.

In order for a personality dimension to be called "fundamental and unitary," Cattell believed that it needed to be found in factor analyses of data from all three of these measurement domains. Thus, Cattell constructed measures of a wide range of personality traits in each medium (L-data; Q-data; T-data).  He then conducted a programmatic series of factor analyses on the data derived from each of the three measurement media in order to elucidate the dimensionality of human personality structure.&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1983)."/&gt;

With the help of many colleagues, Cattell's factor-analytic studies&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1978)."/&gt; continued over several decades, eventually finding at least [[16 Personality Factors|16 primary trait factors]] underlying human personality (comprising 15 personality dimensions and one cognitive ability dimension: Factor B in the 16PF).  He decided to name these traits with letters (A, B, C, D, E...) in order to avoid misnaming these newly discovered dimensions, or inviting confusion with existing vocabulary and concepts.  Factor-analytic studies conducted by many researchers in diverse cultures around the world have provided substantial support for the validity of these 16 trait dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Studies that provide support for Cattell's 16-factor theory include:  Boyle, G.J.

In order to measure these trait constructs across different age ranges, Cattell constructed (Q-data) instruments that included the [[Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire]] (16PF) for adults, the High School Personality Questionnaire (HSPQ) - now named the Adolescent Personality Questionnaire (APQ), and the Children’s Personality Questionnaire (CPQ).&lt;ref&gt;These personality instruments have been available from [http://www.ipat.com IPAT], a test publishing company that Cattell and his wife Karen founded (OPP Ltd., Oxford, England is now the parent company of the Institute for Personality and Ability Testing (IPAT) Inc. of Champaign, Illinois).&lt;/ref&gt; Cattell also constructed the (T-data) Objective Analytic Battery (OAB) that provided measures of the 10 largest personality trait factors extracted factor analytically,&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R. B. &amp; Schuerger, J. M. (1978). ''Personality Theory in Action: Handbook for the Objective-Analytic (O-A) Test Kit''. Champaign, IL: IPAT&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schuerger, J. M. (2008). The Objective-Analytic Test Battery. In G.J. Boyle et al. (Eds.), ''The SAGE Handbook of Personality Theory and Assessment: Vol. 2 – Personality Measurement and Testing''. (pp. 529-546). Los Angeles, CA: Sage {{ISBN|1-4129-2364-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as objective (T-data) measures of dynamic trait constructs such as the Motivation Analysis Test (MAT), the School Motivation Analysis Test (SMAT), and the Children's Motivation Analysis Test (CMAT).&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. &amp; Child, D. (1975)."/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Child, D.(1984). Motivation and dynamic calculus: A teacher's view. ''Multivariate Behavioral Research, 19'', 288-298.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to measure trait constructs within the abnormal personality sphere, Cattell constructed the Clinical Analysis Questionnaire (CAQ)&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R. B. &amp; Sells, S. B. (1974). ''The Clinical Analysis Questionnaire''. Champaign, IL: IPAT.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krug, S. E. (1980). ''Clinical Analysis Questionnaire Manual''. Champaign, IL: IPAT.&lt;/ref&gt; Part 1 of the CAQ measures the 16PF factors, While Part 2 measures an additional 12 abnormal (psychopathological) personality trait dimensions. The CAQ was later re-badged as the PsychEval Personality Questionnaire (PEPQ).&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R. B., Cattell, A. K., &amp; Cattell, H. E. P. (2003). ''The PsychEval Personality Questionnaire''. Champaign, IL: IPAT.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krug, S. E. (2008). The assessment of clinical disorders with Raymond Cattell's personality model. In G.J. Boyle et al. (Eds.), ''The SAGE Handbook of Personality Theory and Assessment: Vol. 2 – Personality Measurement and testing'' (pp. 646-662). Los Angeles: Sage. {{ISBN|1-4129-2364-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also within the broadly conceptualized personality domain, Cattell constructed measures of mood states and transitory emotional states, including the Eight State Questionnaire (8SQ)&lt;ref&gt;Curran, J. P. &amp; Cattell, R. B. (1976). ''Manual for the Eight State Questionnaire''. Champaign, IL: IPAT&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G. J. (1991). Item analysis of the subscales in the Eight State Questionnaire (8SQ): Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. ''Multivariate Experimental Clinical Research, 10''(1), 37-65.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Cattell was at the forefront in constructing the Central Trait-State Kit.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, K. &amp; Cattell, R. B. (1981). ''The Central Trait-State Kit (CTS): Experimental Version''. Champaign, IL: IPAT.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barton, K. (1985). ''The Central Trait-State Scales: A Kit of 20 Subtests Measuring Five Central Personality Dimensions as Traits and States, with Equivalent Forms''. Champaign, IL: IPAT.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the very beginning of his academic career, Cattell reasoned that, as in other scientific domains like intelligence, there might be an additional, higher level of organization within personality which would provide a structure for the many primary traits.  When he factor analyzed the intercorrelations of the 16 primary trait measures themselves, he found no fewer than five "second-order" or "global factors", now commonly known as the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]].&lt;ref name="Goldberg, L. R. (1993)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1995)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyle, G. J. (2008)."/&gt; These second-stratum or "global traits" are conceptualized as broad, overarching domains of behavior, which provide meaning and structure for the primary traits.  For example, the "global trait" Extraversion has emerged from factor-analytic results comprising the five primary trait factors that are interpersonal in focus.&lt;ref&gt;Krug, S. E. &amp; Johns, E. F. (1986). A large scale cross-validation of second-order personality structure defined by the 16PF. ''Psychological Reports, 59'', 683-693.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, "global" Extraversion is fundamentally defined by the primary traits that are grouped together factor analytically, and, moving in the opposite direction, the second-order Extraversion factor gives conceptual meaning and structure to these primary traits, identifying their focus and function in human personality.  These two levels of personality structure can provide an integrated understanding of the whole person, with the "global traits" giving an overview of the individual’s functioning in a broad-brush way, and the more-specific primary trait scores providing an in-depth, detailed picture of the individual’s unique trait combinations (Cattell's "Depth Psychometry" p.&amp;nbsp;71).&lt;ref name="Cattell, R. B. (1987). ''Psychotherapy"/&gt;

Research into the 16PF personality factors has shown these constructs to be useful in understanding and predicting a wide range of real life behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Conn, S. R. &amp; Rieke, M. L. (1994).  ''The 16PF Fifth Edition Technical Manual.''  Champaign, IL: IPAT.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, M. T. &amp; Karol, D. L. (1994) ''The 16PF Fifth Edition Administrator's Manual.'' Champaign, IL: IPAT.[http://www.ipat.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the 16 primary trait measures plus the five major second-stratum factors have been used in educational settings to study and predict achievement motivation, learning or cognitive style, creativity, and compatible career choices; in work or employment settings to predict leadership style, interpersonal skills, creativity, conscientiousness, stress-management, and accident-proneness; in medical settings to predict heart attack proneness, pain management variables, likely compliance with medical instructions, or recovery pattern from burns or organ transplants; in clinical settings to predict self-esteem, interpersonal needs, frustration tolerance, and openness to change; and, in research settings to predict a wide range of behavioral proclivities such as aggression, conformity, and authoritarianism.&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, H.

As [[Hans Eysenck]] at the [[Institute of Psychiatry]], [[London]] remarked:
 
"Cattell has been one of the most prolific writers in psychology since Wilhelm Wundt....According to the Citation Index, he is one of the ten most cited psychologists, and this is true with regard to not only citations in social science journals but also those in science journals generally. Of the two hundred and fifty most cited scientists, only three psychologists made the grade, namely, Sigmund Freud in the first place, then the reviewer [H.J. Eysenck], and then Cattell. Thus there is no question that Cattell has made a tremendous impression on psychology and science in general."&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, H. J. (1985). ''Review of Raymond B. Cattell’s (1983). Structured Personality-Learning Theory: A Wholistic Multivariate Research Approach''.  New York: Praeger. (p.76)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and the APA Lifetime Achievement Award==
In 1997, at 92 years of age, Cattell was chosen by the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) for its "Gold Medal Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Science of Psychology." Before the medal was presented, [[Barry Mehler]] launched a publicity campaign against Cattell&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferris.edu/isar/bios/Cattell/gold.htm ISAR - Beyondist guru to get 1997 Gold Medal at APA]&lt;/ref&gt; through his nonprofit foundation [[Institute for the Study of Academic Racism|ISAR]] accusing Cattell of being sympathetic to racist and fascist ideas&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferris.edu/isar/bios/Cattell/homepage.htm ISAR - R.B. Cattell Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; and claiming that "it is unconscionable to honor this man whose work helps to dignify the most destructive political ideas of the twentieth century". A blue-ribbon committee was convened by the APA to investigate the legitimacy of the charges. However, before the committee reached a decision, Cattell issued an open letter to the committee saying "I abhor racism and discrimination based on race.

Cattell and the New Eugenics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mehler reports he was mentored by Jerry Hirsch, a critic of Cattell at the University of Illinois, where Cattell and Hirsch spent most of their careers.&lt;/ref&gt; have criticized Cattell based on his writings about evolution and political systems. They argue that throughout his life Cattell adhered to a mixture of eugenics and a new religion of his devising which he eventually named Beyondism and proposed as "a new morality from science".&lt;ref&gt;Footnote. In fact, Cattell was opposed to subjective religious beliefs, which in October 1987 he described as "emotional"&lt;/ref&gt;  Cattell argues that a diversity of cultural groups is necessary to allow that evolution. Cattell entertains controversial speculations about natural selection based not only on the separation of groups but also the restriction of "external" assistance to "failing" groups from "successful" ones, and by arguing for "educational and voluntary birth control measures"— i.e., by separating groups and limiting excessive growth of failing groups.&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R. B. (1972). ''A New Morality from Science: Beyondism'' (pp.95, 221). New York: Pergamon.&lt;/ref&gt; John Gillis, biographer of Cattell has argued that, although some of Cattell's views are indeed controversial, Tucker and Mehler have exaggerated and misrepresented his views by taking quotes out of context, and by referring back to outdated writings.&lt;ref name="Gillis, J."/&gt;

In analysing the accusations that resulted in withholding of Cattell's Gold Medal Award, Magrietha Lotz (2008, p.&amp;nbsp;136) concluded that: "Cattell was deliberately misquoted...and labelled as an academic racist. The views he developed in the 1930s were common among his contemporaries when beliefs in racial differences were widely held, and should not be distorted by judgment according to today's standards. General scientific observations should not be read as personal moral statements. He was particularly wronged during the 1990s by certain writers (William H. Tucker and Barry Mehler) who picked out certain references referring to Germany, Hitler or genocide and quoted them out of context."&lt;ref&gt;Lotz, M. A. C. M. (2008). ''Beyondism: The thinking of Raymond Bernard Cattell (1905–1998) on religion, and his religious thought''. (Masters Dissertation) Pretoria, South Africa: University of South Africa [http://uir.unisa.ac.za/handle/10500/2688]. [Retrieved 12 August 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in 1984 Cattell had stated unambiguously that: "The only reasonable thing is to be noncommittal on the race question – that's not the central issue, and it would be a great mistake to be sidetracked into all the emotional upsets that go on in discussions of racial differences. We should be quite careful to dissociate eugenics from it – eugenics' real concern should be with individual differences."&lt;ref name="Boyle, G. J., Stankov, L. (2016)"/&gt; Indeed, contrary to the allegations of racism, Richard L. Gorsuch (1997) wrote (in a letter to the [[American Psychological Foundation]], para. 4) that: "The charge of racism is 180 degrees off track. [Cattell] was the first one to challenge the racial bias in tests and to attempt to reduce that problem."&lt;ref name="Boyle, G. J., Stankov, L. (2016)"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2817">'''Richard "Dick" Bailey Scotton''' [[Order of Australia|AO]] is an Australian [[health economist]]. He is best known as the original author of the Australian [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] program - Australia's first and current system of publicly funded [[universal health care]]. 

Scotton was educated at the [[University of Sydney]] where he obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and a [[Bachelor of Economics]].

==Medicare==

Between 1965 and 1970, Scotton worked with [[John Deeble]] to formulate a universal health care system for Australia. At that time, Australia was coming to the end of more than two decades of conservative government by the Liberal-National Coalition under Prime Ministers [[Robert Menzies]], [[Harold Holt]] [[John Gorton]] and [[William McMahon]]. The [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] and [[National Party of Australia|National]] parties opposed such a system, and so the plan was initially rejected. However, the Government's attitude changed in 1972 with the election of the reformist [[Whitlam]] Labor Government, who had campaigned promising to implement free universal health care in Australia for the first time. Scotton then entered the public service to implement his Medicare (known at the time as Medibank) program as chairman of the Health Insurance Commission (1973–1976). He worked closely with Social Security Minister [[Bill Hayden]] as a Special Advisor for several years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/173_01_030700/scotton2/scotton2.html eMJA: Scotton, Medicare: options for the next 25 years&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==

He spent part of his career at the [[University of Melbourne]]. Scotton then held senior administrative positions in the Health Commission of Victoria and the Victorian Accident Compensation Commission. He then returned to academia as a professorial fellow in health economics at [[Monash University]]'s Centre for Health Program Evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adm.monash.edu.au/records-archives/archives/memo-archive///memo00/issue20-00/about.html Monash Memo: 21 June 2000 About Monash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Scotton retired from full-time work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usyd.edu.au/alumni/about/profiles/1950s.shtml GRADUATED IN THE 1950s - Alumni &amp; Friends - The University of Sydney&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005093510/http://www.usyd.edu.au/alumni/about/profiles/1950s.shtml |date=October 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18390">'''Robert Coles''' (born  October 12, 1929) is an [[United States|American]] [[author]], child psychiatrist, and professor emeritus at [[Harvard University]].

==Life and career==
Born Martin Robert Coles in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] on October 12, 1929, to Philip Coles, an immigrant from [[Leeds, England]], [[United Kingdom]], and Sandra Young Coles, originally from [[Sioux City, Iowa]].   Robert Coles attended [[Boston Latin School]] where he played tennis, ran track, and edited the school [[literary magazine]]. He entered [[Harvard College]] in 1946, where he studied [[English literature]] and helped to edit the undergraduate literary magazine, ''The Harvard Advocate''.  He graduated [[magna cum laude]] and earned [[Phi Beta Kappa]] honors in 1950. He originally intended to become a teacher or professor, but as part of his senior honors [[thesis]], he interviewed the [[poet]] and [[physician]] [[William Carlos Williams]], who promptly persuaded him to go into medicine.

He studied medicine at [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]], graduating in 1954. After [[residency training]] at the [[University of Chicago]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]] (the [[University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine]]), Coles moved on to psychiatric residencies at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and [[McLean Hospital]] in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]] (the two hospitals are affiliates of [[Harvard University]] and the [[Harvard University Medical School]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]). Knowing that he was to be called into the [[U.S. Armed Forces]] under the "[[Doctors' Draft|doctors' draft]]," Coles joined the Air Force in 1958 and was assigned the rank of captain. His field of specialization was psychiatry, his intention eventually to sub-specialize in child psychiatry.

He served as chief of neuropsychiatric services at Keesler Air Force base in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]], and made frequent trips into [[New Orleans]]. During these trips he witnessed scenes of racial conflict, many of them related to the desegregation of the public schools. He wrote a series of articles for ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', profiling [[Ruby Bridges]], one of the first black children to desegregate a public elementary school in New Orleans and therefore a target of daily public protests, intimidation, and even death threats. As a child psychiatrist, he had volunteered to support and counsel Ruby and her family during this difficult period. These articles led to his first book, ''Children of Crisis: A Study of Courage and Fear'', and ultimately to his decision to develop that book into a series of books documenting how children and their parents deal with profound change, a series that won him the Pulitzer prize in 1973. In 1995 he returned to his original material and wrote ''The Story of Ruby Bridges'', a popular children's book, published by [[Scholastic Press|Scholastic Corporation]].

He has authored more than eighty books and 1300 articles, nearly all of them centrally concerned with human moral, spiritual, and social sensibility and reasoning, mainly in children but also in adults, writers especially,&lt;ref&gt;"Biographical Sketch of Robert Coles, Dale Richmond Award Winner" by William Coleman, M.D. FAAP, Chapel Hill, NC. Developmental and Behavioral News. Volume 7, Number 1, Fall 1998. from the Web site "American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics" http://www.dbpeds.org/section/fall98/coles.html accessed March 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; including the novelist Walker Percy (who dedicated his final novel, ''The Thanatos Syndrome'', to Coles), the poet William Carlos Williams, writer James Agee, novelist Flannery O'Connor, and others, such as Dorothy Day, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Simone Weil, and Dorothy Lange.&lt;ref&gt;Lives We Carry With Us:  Profiles of Moral Courage by Robert Coles.  New York:  The New Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his honorable discharge from the Air Force, Coles returned briefly to Boston.  On July 4, 1960, he married Jane Hallowell, a graduate of Radcliffe College and a high school teacher of English and history.  After Coles finished his child psychiatry training at the Children's Hospital, the Coleses returned to the South, living in New Orleans.  In addition to continuing work with children in New Orleans and Atlanta, Coles began writing non-technical articles for a number of national publications, including ''The Atlantic Monthly'', ''The New Republic'', ''Saturday Review'', and ''The Times of London''.  By 1969, Coles was writing in-depth profiles for ''The New Yorker'' and contributing regular columns to ''The New Republic'', ''New Oxford Review'', ''America'', and the ''American Poetry Review''.

At the urging of Erik Erikson, in 1963 Coles became affiliated with the University Health Services at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] as a research psychiatrist. Gradually, he began teaching in the [[Harvard Medical School]], eventually becoming Professor of Psychiatry and Medical Humanities in 1977. He has taught courses in various schools across Harvard University, including the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Business School, the Law School, the Extension School, and the School of Education, where in 1995 he was given a newly established position as James Agee Professor of Social Ethics. He came to teach courses not only in the moral, spiritual, and social sensibilities of children but also in those phenomena generally, especially as expressed in stories, both literary fictions and oral narratives, and as affected by conditions of poverty and social injustice. As a longtime professor, Coles has influenced generations of Harvard undergraduates and graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;"Robert Coles Wins Medal of Freedom." William J. Cromie. The Harvard University Gazette. January 15, 1998. http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1998/01.15/RobertColesWins.html. Accessed March 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Harvard University named an annual Call of Service lecture in honor of Coles.

His work has been recognized with numerous awards, including election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971, a [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]] in 1973 for his series of books ''[[Children of Crisis]]'', a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Award]] in 1981, the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1998, and the [[National Humanities Medal]] in 2001. He later co-founded the magazine ''DoubleTake'', which documented the lives of ordinary people with photographs, articles, essays, poetry, and short stories.  The magazine won several awards, including the 1998 National Magazine Award for Editorial Excellence in the category of General Excellence.

Many of Coles' works draw heavily on quoted conversations with ordinary people, as well as insights from prominent thinkers and leaders — often people Coles has encountered personally in his career — such as [[William Carlos Williams]], [[Dorothy Day]], [[Walker Percy]], [[William Shawn]], [[Anna Freud]], [[Paul Tillich]], [[Erik Erikson]], and [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Starting with the ''Children of Crisis'' series, Coles's approach to his subjects involves a difficult balancing act at the heart of the documentary enterprise.  His methods combine techniques of participant observation (tape recordings, field notes, drawings, etc.), clinical interpretation, academic social research, and literary narrative. Coles has never been diffident about the economic, social, and racial injustices he has observed in the field.  He is a spokesperson for his subjects, a sounding board for their public voices.  Coles describes his own literary methods and goals as an effort "to blend poetic insight with a craft and unite ultimately the rational and the intuitive, the aloof stance of the scholar with the passion and affection of the friend who cares and is moved."  (''The Mind's Fate'', p.&amp;nbsp;10)

In a 2003 review of Coles' book on musician [[Bruce Springsteen]],&lt;ref&gt;" [http://www.tnr.com/article/tramps-who Hajdu D. "Tramps Like Who? ''The New Republic'' Dec. 15, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; music critic [[David Hajdu]] questioned the truthfulness and accuracy of Coles's reports of the opinions on Springsteen held by various people, suggesting that some source quotations may have been fabricated:

::The fact that William Carlos Williams and Walker Percy had such extensive conversations with Robert Coles on the subjects of the New Jersey pop singers Frank Sinatra and Bruce Springsteen and that those discussions yielded insights so parallel and neatly suited to Coles's own take on Springsteen is incredible--utterly incredible. I was not there to overhear them, of course, and it is impossible to check with Williams and Percy, or with the late Erikson and Shawn, whom Coles's other deceased sources quotes in his book's opening sections. But I did ask Will Percy about the comments on Springsteen that Coles attributes to his uncle, and he called them "outrageous". Walker Percy "definitely didn't talk like that", according to his nephew.

While "the facts of his subjects' lives are indisputable," one Coles' scholar cautions that "some distortion is perhaps inevitable given Coles' method and purposes and expectations of his readers.  The portraits are not written as true documentary accounts of the lives of his subjects but are presented as composite views of many [subjects] designed to highlight certain features of American social life neglected in other accounts of the poor.  And if they are not true, neither are they false.  In some respects . . . they have the status of fiction based very firmly on the transcription of life.  They examine the range of human possibility beyond category and social stereotype. . . ."  (Steven Weiland,  ''Intellectual Craftsmen:  Ways and Works in American Scholarship,'' New Jersey: Transactions Publishers (1991): 86; and ''Handing One Another Along Literature and Social Reflection'', 2010.)

'''Rubble''' (born {{circa|April 1988}}) is a [[domestic cat]] owned by Michelle Foster of [[Exeter]], [[Devon]], England.  Foster acquired the cat as a kitten on or near her 20th birthday.  Rubble, a [[Maine Coon]]-type cat, achieved the age of 30 in May 2018 and is currently{{When|date=September 2018}} the world's oldest living cat.&lt;ref name="Rubble"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2018/06/02/worlds-oldest-cat-celebrates-30th-birthday.html|title=World's oldest cat celebrates 30th birthday|last=Bevan|first=Tom|website=foxnews.com|accessdate=June 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foster stated that, "He's a lovely cat, although he has got a little grumpy in his old age. I got him just before my 20th birthday when he was a kitten. Rubble suffers from [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] so he needs regular medication and City Vets have been a huge help in keeping him healthy."  Foster further stated, "He has plenty of life left in him yet, but I don't think we will go down the Guinness World Record route as I am not sure he would like lots of people coming to see him or a fuss being made out of him. He is old now and would not like too much attention or be hassled. We would prefer if he was just left to live out his old age in peace."&lt;ref name="Rubble" /&gt; Rubble's milestone 30th birthday was celebrated with a party at his [[veterinary physician]]'s office.  He feasted on his favorite food  and treats and received a free check-up.

The previous oldest living cat in the Britain—[[Nutmeg (cat)|Nutmeg]] from [[Tyne and Wear Metro|Tyne and Wear]]—passed away in September 2017. Rubble has now matched the age of [[Scooter (cat)|Scooter]], a [[Siamese cat|Siamese]] who also achieved the age of 30 and was recognized by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]]. Scooter died in his 30th year.&lt;ref name="Rubble" /&gt;

The oldest cat in world history according to the record books was [[Creme Puff (cat)|Creme Puff]], who was born on August 3, 1967, and lived until August 6, 2005—a total of 38 years and 3 days.&lt;ref name="Rubble" /&gt;

The '''Songshan Cultural and Creative Park''' ('''SSCC'''; {{zh|c=松山文創園區|p=Sōngshān Wénchuàng Yuánqū}}) is a multifunctional [[park]] in [[Xinyi District]], [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]].

==History==
The park was initially constructed in 1937 as a [[tobacco]] factory under the name {{nihongo|'''Matsuyama Tobacco Plant of the Monopoly Bureau of the Taiwan Governor's Office'''|臺灣總督府專賣局松山菸草工場}} under the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese government]]. After [[Retrocession Day|Japan ceded Taiwan]] in 1945, the Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau took over the factory and renamed it as the '''Songshan Tobacco Plant of the Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau'''. In 1947, the plant was renamed again as '''Songshan Tobacco Plant of the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Bureau'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeiartplus.org/08.html |title=Taipei Art |publisher=Taipeiartplus.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The factory ceased to produce cigarettes in 1998 for concern over urban planning, tobacco and liquor marketing regulatory changes and the decline in tobacco demand.

In 2001, the [[Taipei City Government]] designed the defunct tobacco factory as Taipei's 99th historic site and converted it into a park comprising city-designated historic sites, historical structures and architectural highlights. Together with [[Taipei Dome]], the site is known as '''Taipei Cultural and Sporting Complex'''.

For more efficient reuse of space, in 2011 the former factory was turned into a creative park by its current name to provide venues for diverse cultural and creative exhibitions and performances.

==Purposes==
The park has the following aims:{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

* Establish public platform and develop the cultural and creative industry;
* Cultivate culture and creativity and cross industry exchanges;
* Develop innovative experiments and set trends;
* Provide cultural and arts education and encourage public involvement;
* Spotlight the cultural and creative industry and put Taiwan on the map.

===Warehouses===
There are five warehouses, from number 1 until 5. The workers manufactured cigarettes on the second floor of the plant. After packaging the rolled cigarettes, the boxes were sent directly to warehouse no. 2 using conveyor channel, through the turntable, directed to the platforms for delivery, hence reducing manual labor.

===Inspection Room===
The inspection room served as the place for employees and officers had to pass through when reporting for or getting off work. It had stationed guards on duty.

===Innovative Design Lab===
{{empty section|date=February 2014}}

===Tobacco Factory===
The tobacco factory consists of three segments, which are North, South and East. The building has characteristics of long open hallways with no dividing walls. The first floor mainly comprises columns to support the weight of the machines on the second floor.

===Baroque Garden===
Enclosed by the tobacco factory three sections, the garden has a fountain that is surrounded by sculptures of naked women emerging from their baths.

===TMSK Restaurant===
The building which now houses the TMSK restaurant used to be the machine repair plant building. The machine repair plant was exclusively responsible for the reparation and maintenance of the tobacco producing machines.

===Boiler Room===
The boiler room acted as the power source for the tobacco plant. [[Coal]] was burnt here to provide power for the plant. The chimneys were used to expel the smoke generated.

===Nursery Room===
There used to be 1,200 employees working at the plant at the same time. The tobacco plant had an industrial village concept, in which it included facilities such as cafeterias, shower facilities, dormitories, hospital, food mall, dining rooms, entertainment rooms and nursery. The nursery room served as a place for the infants of the employees to rest and play.

===Ecology Pond===
For fire extinguishing, ventilation and hydrosphere purposes, a large lotus pond was installed. It is now revamped as an ecology pond where children can enjoy the sounds of frogs and insects and experience the beauty of ecology.

'''''The Cigarette Papers''''' is a 1996 non-fiction book by [[Stanton A. Glantz]] (editor), John Slade (editor), [[Lisa A. Bero]] (editor), Peter Hanauer (editor), Deborah E. Barnes (editor), and [[C. Everett Koop]] (Foreword), analyzing [[Whistleblower|leaked]] documents that for the first time proved "tobacco companies had long known the grave dangers of smoking, and did nothing about it." In May 1994, 4,000 pages of internal tobacco industry documents were sent to the office of Professor Stanton Glantz, a well-known anti-smoking activist, at the [[University of California, San Francisco]]. The source of these "cigarette papers" was identified only as [[Mr. Butts]]. The documents provide an inside look at the internal activities of American tobacco company, [[Brown &amp; Williamson]], over more than 30 years.&lt;ref name="dlib"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november96/11butter.html | title=The Cigarette Papers: Issues in Publishing Materials in Multiple Formats |author1=Karen Butter |author2=Robin Chandler |author3=John Kunze  |last-author-amp=yes | journal=D-Lib Magazine |date=November 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520213722 | title=The Cigarette Papers | publisher=Universityof California Press | accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/smoke/readings/wienerarticle.html | title=The Cigarette Papers | publisher=PBS | date=1 January 1996 | accessdate=17 December 2014 | author=Wiener, Jon}} This is an authorized reprint of an article that appeared in ''[[The Nation]]'' in 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Timer cartoon.png|thumb|right|250px|Timer in "Quickie Breakfast"]]
'''''Time for Timer''''' is a title for a short series of [[public service announcements]] [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] on Saturday mornings on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television network]] starting in the early 1970s. The animated spots featured Timer, a tiny [[cartoon character]] who represents the sense of "time" in the human body. Timer is in charge of when a person felt it was time to eat, time to sleep, etc. He carries a large pocket watch inside of him, which would often set off an alarm whenever something was about to happen. 

Usually wearing a [[bow tie]] and [[top hat]], Timer looks somewhat like a little yellow blob with long arms and legs, and a face. Timer also has limited magical powers, such as instant transportation, which he often uses to exit his host body from time to time if things got too exhausting. A wise-cracker as well as a song-and-dance man, Timer promotes healthy eating and personal [[hygiene]] for children, using clever songs and animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/time_for_timer_saturday_morning_cartoon_psas_from_the_70s|title=‘Time for Timer!’: Saturday morning cartoon PSAs from the 70s|date=January 15, 2013|publisher=Dangerous Minds|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like ABC's ''[[The Bod Squad]]'' series, the segments never carried official titles, but are referred to by memorable catch phrases in the songs' lyrics. Perhaps most memorable was "I Hanker for a Hunk of Cheese" in which Timer, recast as a cowboy with a thick Western accent, suggests "wagon wheels," sandwiches made with cheese slices and crackers as an easy and nutritious snack. (When Timer prepares one on a kitchen counter, he rolls it down the counter on its edge and tells us, "Look! A wagon wheel!")  Others included "You Are What You Eat" (a simplified explanation of nutrients and how the body uses them), "Quickie Breakfast" (leftovers and other premade foods as an alternative for kids who do not have time, or are unable, to cook breakfast), and "Sunshine on a Stick" (how to make [[ice pop]]s with fruit juice, an ice tray, and toothpicks).

''Time for Timer'' ran concurrently and interchangeably for many years with ABC's other educational spots, primarily ''The Bod Squad'' and ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!]]''. They generally appeared between [[Saturday morning cartoon|cartoon programs]] on the hour and half hour marks interspersed with regular [[commercials]].

Timer's voice was provided by actor [[Lennie Weinrib]]. The spots themselves were produced by the cartoon studio [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]]. During the final five seconds or so of each segment (sometimes the first 5 seconds), the following end credit appeared on the bottom of the screen:

:''An ABC Presentation
:''Consultant: Dr. Roslyn B. Alfin-Slater
:''UCLA School of Public Health''

Timer first appeared in the 1973 ''[[ABC Afterschool Special]]''  "The Incredible, Indelible, Magical, Physical Mystery Trip", where he was voiced by Len Maxwell. Timer also appeared in the 1974 ''ABC Afterschool Special'' "The Magical Mystery Trip Through Little Red's Head" (now voiced by Lennie Weinrib). In Mystery Trip, he was working inside the body of a man named "Uncle Carl". In Little Red, he was working inside the (Teenaged) Red Riding Hood.

'''World Water Day''' is an annual [[List of awareness days|UN observance day]] (always on 22 March) that highlights the importance of [[Fresh water|freshwater]].&lt;ref name="UNWWD" /&gt; The day is used to [[Advocacy|advocate]] for the [[sustainable management]] of [[Water resources|freshwater resources]].&lt;ref name="UNWWD"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/events/waterday/background.shtml|title=Background information on World Water Day, 22 March|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UN-Water|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; World Water Day is celebrated around the world with a variety of events. These can be educational, theatrical, musical or lobbying in nature. The day can also include campaigns to raise money for water projects. The first World Water Day, designated by the [[United Nations]], was commemorated in 1993.&lt;ref name="UNWATER2" /&gt; Each year more and more countries celebrate World Water Day.

[[UN-Water]] selects a theme for each year.&lt;ref name="UNWATER2" /&gt; The theme for 2018 was "Nature for Water" to encourage people to "look for the answer in nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldwaterday.org/|title=World Water Day 2018 official website|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme encouraged the use of [[nature-based solutions]] to water-related challenges. For example, reducing [[Flood|floods]], [[Drought|droughts]], [[water pollution]] and protecting [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] could be solved using natural means, which nature uses, rather than man-made approaches.

Previous themes for the years 2015 to 2017 were "Water and Sustainable Development",  "Water and Jobs'" and "Why waste water?"  The latter theme  included attention to both [[wastewater]] and the value of [[Reclaimed water|reclaiming water]]. The focus on universal access to [[Drinking water|clean water]], [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] [[WASH|(WASH]]) is in line with the targets of [[Sustainable Development Goal 6]].&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UN World Water Development Report]] is released each year around World Water Day.

World Water Day is an [[List of international observances|international observance day]]. The intention is to inspire people around the world to learn more about water-related issues and to take action to make a difference.&lt;ref name="UNWWD" /&gt;

The global water crisis is one of the issues that calls for action.&lt;ref name="UNWWD" /&gt; The challenges include [[water scarcity]], [[water pollution]], inadequate [[water supply]] and the lack of [[sanitation]] for billions of people in less developed countries.  The day brings to light the inequality of access to [[WASH]] services and the need to assure the [[Right to water|human right to water and sanitation]].

== Convener ==

[[UN-Water]] coordinates activities with UN member organisations who share an interest in that year's theme. In 2016 the "Water and Jobs" theme led to a collaboration with the [[International Labour Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/sector/WCMS_458061/lang--en/index.htm|title=Event to mark World Water Day 2016 and launch the World Water Development Report|last=|first=|date=|website=International Labour Organisation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; UN-Water mobilizes organizations of all kinds to action, whether globally or locally.

The World Water Day website announces events, activities and volunteer opportunities. In 2018, stories are about "Nature and water from around the world" in keeping with the theme of "Nature for water".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldtoiletday.info/stories/|title=World Water Days Stories (2018)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of activities ==

Organizations active in the [[WASH]] sector use the day to raise public awareness, get [[media attention]] for water issues and inspire action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/jordan/media_10914.html|title=Humanitarian agencies come together to promote water conservation on World Water Day in Jordan|last=|first=|date=22 March 2016|website=|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activities have included releasing publications and films, as well as organizing round tables, seminars and expositions.&lt;ref name="UNWWD" /&gt; [[Non-governmental organization]]s such as [[UNICEF]], [[WaterAid]] and Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP). 

[[End Water Poverty]], a global civil society coalition with 250 partner organizations, sponsors Water Action Month each year and offers an event-planning guidebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.endwaterpoverty.org/news/water-action-month-2018|title=Water Action Month|last=|first=|date=|website=End Water Poverty:  Sanitation and Water for All|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UN World Water Development Report|UN World Water Development Report (WWDR)]] is released each year on World Water Day. Information related to the annual theme gives decision-makers tools to implement sustainable use of [[water resources]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unwater.org/publication_categories/world-water-development-report/|title=World Water Development Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UN-Water|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More and more initiatives in schools and universities are educating people about the importance of conserving and managing water resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kidworldcitizen.org/2012/03/22/celebrate-world-water-day-with-games-and-activities-for-all-ages/|title=Celebrate World Water Day with Games and Activities for all ages!|last=|first=|date=22 March 2012|website=Kids World Citizen|access-date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kidworldcitizen.org/2015/03/22/hands-on-water-activities-for-kids/|title=Hands-on Water Activities for Kids|last=|first=|date=22 March 2015|website=Kids World Citizen|access-date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TES"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tes.com/teaching-resource/world-water-day-2017-primary-resources-6415485|title=World Water Day 2017 Primary Resources|last=|first=|date=|website=tes.com|access-date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Michigan State University]] held a contest for "best World Water Day poster" in 2017. Primary school children in [[Philippines|the Philippines]] participated in a "My School Toilet" contest in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wendland, C|last2=Rieck, C|last3=Roenitzsch, S|last4=van Epps, A.|title=Making WASH in Schools more sustainable - Case Stories from SuSanA Partners.|date=2014|publisher=SuSanA|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2077|ref=Susana2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Impacts ===
In 2016, the World Water Day campaign and related publications reached millions of people through [[social media]], dedicated websites and other channels: The UN-Water annual report states that [[social media]] engagement (hashtag #WorldWaterDay) had a maximum potential reach of 1.6 billion people worldwide in 2016.&lt;ref name="UNWater2016"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.unwater.org/publications/un-water-annual-report-2016/|title=Annual Report UN-Water|last=|first=|publisher=UN-Water|year=2016|isbn=|location=Geneva, Switzerland|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}} Over 500 events in 1000 countries were registered on the World Water Day website that year.&lt;ref name="UNWater2016" /&gt;{{rp|21}}

==History==

This day was first formally proposed in [[Agenda 21]] of the 1992 [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. In December 1992, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted resolution A/RES/47/193 by which 22 March of each year was declared World Day for Water.&lt;ref name="UNWWD" /&gt;

In 1993, the first World Water Day was observed.&lt;ref name="UNWATER2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/events/waterday/|title=UN-Water: World Water Day|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UN-Water|language=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Annual themes ==
=== 2018 – Nature for Water ===
The theme in 2018 explores how nature can be used to overcome the water challenges of the 21st century. This could be in the form of [[nature-based solutions]] to reduce [[Flood|floods]], [[Drought|droughts]] and [[water pollution]] and protect [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]]. Restoring [[wetlands]], implementing [[constructed wetlands]], [[Green roof|green roofs]], [[green infrastructure]], planting new forests, reconnecting rivers to floodplains, are some examples. Each of these use natural processes to rebalance the [[water cycle]] and improve human health and livelihoods.&lt;ref name="UNWATER2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018: Nature-based Solutions for Water], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2017 – Why Waste Water? ===
In 2017, the theme was "Why Waste Water?" which is about reducing and [[reclaimed water|reusing wastewater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldwaterday.org/2017/theme/|title=World Water Day theme (2017)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UN-Water|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme is a play on words as it relates to both: the aspect of wasting [[Drinking water|water]] and issues around [[wastewater]], namely [[Wastewater treatment|treatment]] and reuse. Wastewater is a valuable resource to help achieve the [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Sustainable Development Goal Number 6]]. One aspect of Target 6.3 is to halve the proportion of untreated wastewater and also to increase the recycling and [[Reclaimed water|safe reuse]] of water across the globe. After appropriate [[wastewater treatment|treatment]], wastewater can be used for a variety of purposes. Industry, for example, can reuse water in [[cooling towers]] and agriculture can reuse water for [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;UN-Water (2017) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2017/ World Water Development Report 2017], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

An example activity for 2017 was the Wikipedia [[edit-a-thon]] organized by members of the [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] on 19–21 March 2017. The purpose of the activity was to improve water and [[sanitation]] related content on [[Wikipedia]] just ahead of World Water Day. The goal was to improve the quantity and quality of sanitation information available on [[Wikipedia]] for the use of teachers, journalists and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://views-voices.oxfam.org.uk/wash/2017/03/wikipedia-a-tool-for-advocacy/ Wikipedia: a tool for Advocacy?]". Oxfam Policy &amp; Practice, Views &amp; Voices, retrieved 20 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 – Better Water, Better Jobs ===
The 2016 theme of "Better water, better jobs" highlighted the correlation between water and job creation, both directly and indirectly by water sources around the globe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wwd.unwater.org/2016/|title=World Water Day 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UN-Water|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As water scarcity becomes more of a reality, industries heavily dependent on water like textiles and agriculture are at risk of increased costs, which threatens salaries and jobs.  Increased costs may then be passed on to consumers.

The theme also highlights how an abundance of quality water can change people's jobs and lives for the better. The 2016 celebration created recognition for those working to improve water quality and availability, and the need for many to transition to other and better jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Three out of four of the jobs worldwide are water-dependent. Water shortages and lack of access may limit economic growth in the years to come, according to the 2016 United Nations World Water Development Report.&lt;ref&gt;UN-Water (2016) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2016/ World Water Development Report 2016: Water and jobs], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2015 – Water and Sustainable Development ===
With the theme ‘Water and Sustainable Development’, the year 2015 provided an important opportunity to consolidate and build upon the previous World Water Days to highlight water's role in the [[Sustainable Development Goals|sustainable development agenda]].&lt;ref name="UNWATER"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wwd.unwater.org/2015/|title=World Water Day 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UN-Water|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) were to have been achieved by 2015, so the year lent itself to discussions of the post-MDG period and aspirations for water and sustainable development.  With the launch of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), world Water Day gave specific emphasis to SDG 6, which calls for water and sanitation for all, by encouraging discussion of how SDG 6 could be achieved by 2030.&lt;ref name="UNWATER2" /&gt;

=== 2014 – Water and Energy ===
The 2014 theme of Water and Energy emphasized the close linkages and interdependence of water and energy and brought attention to the [[water-energy nexus]].&lt;ref name="UNWATER2014" /&gt; About 8% of the energy generated globally is used for pumping, treating and transporting water to various consumers. Furthermore, generating and transmitting energy requires the use of water resources, particularly for [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]], [[Nuclear power|nuclear]], and [[thermal energy]] sources.

The aim of that year's theme was to facilitate the development of policies and crosscutting frameworks that would bridge ministries and sectors. It was meant to lead the way to energy security and sustainable water use in a [[green economy]].&lt;ref name="UNWATER2014"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wwd.unwater.org/2014/|title=World Water Day 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UN-Water|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists from eleven countries in Asia met in Tokoyo from 20–21 March 2014 to discuss the importance of water. The event included discussion panels on topics such as privatisation of services, integration between water and energy and modernisation of water services. The journalists also developed four joint stories and 20 individual story ideas for a network of Asian journalists writing on water (and energy) in social media.&lt;ref name="UN2016"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/pdf/final_report_wwd2014_journalist_workshop.pdf|title=Water and Energy Report on the Journalists Workshop|last=|first=|publisher=UNW-DPAC|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
