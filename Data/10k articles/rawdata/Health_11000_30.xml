The '''Abbreviated mental test score''' ('''AMTS''') was introduced by Hodkinson in 1972&lt;ref name="hodkinson72"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hodkinson|first1=HM|title=Evaluation of a mental test score for assessment of mental impairment in the elderly.|journal=Age and Ageing|date=November 1972|volume=1|issue=4|pages=233–8|pmid=4669880|doi=10.1093/ageing/1.4.233}}&lt;/ref&gt; to rapidly assess [[elderly]] [[patient]]s for the possibility of [[dementia]]. Its uses in [[medicine]] have become somewhat wider over the years and now the AMTS is used to assess for [[mental confusion|confusion]] and other cognitive impairment, although it has mainly been validated in the elderly.

==Questionnaire==
The following questions are put to the patient. Each question correctly answered scores one point. A score of 7-8 or less suggests cognitive impairment at the time of testing, although further and more formal tests are necessary to confirm a diagnosis of dementia, delirium or other causes of cognitive impairment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2158">'''Abortion in Belarus''' has been legal since November 23, 1955, when [[Belarus]] was a republic of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="un"&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/belarus1.doc Belarus - ABORTION POLICY - United Nations]&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[abortion]] legislation dates from December 31, 1987, and is one of the most liberal abortion laws in [[Europe]]. Abortion is allowed on request up to 12 weeks, and in specific circumstances, on a variety of grounds, until 28 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.womenonwaves.org/en/page/4757/belarus--abortion-law&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1987 law allows abortion for the traditional reasons of harm or death to the [[fetus]] and/or mother, [[rape]] and [[incest]], as well as: the death of the husband during [[pregnancy]], a [[jail sentence]] for either the mother or father, a court order stripping the pregnant woman of [[parental rights]], if a household already exceeds five children, if the relationship between mother and father ends in [[divorce]], or a family history which includes [[Mental disability (disambiguation)|mental]] or [[Physical disability|physical disabilities]].&lt;ref name="un" /&gt;

Once a popular method of [[birth control]], abortions exceeded live births two-to-one in 1995.&lt;ref name="rate"&gt;[http://www.data.minsk.by/belarusnews/042009/9.html Fewer Abortions In Belarus, But More Single Mothers]&lt;/ref&gt; The rate had fallen by over 75%, with abortions numbering 42,000 (or 39% of the live birth rate) in 2008.&lt;ref name="rate" /&gt;

{{as of|2010}}, the abortion rate was 14.7 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44 years.&lt;ref name="un2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = World Abortion Policies 2013 | publisher = United Nations | year = 2013 | url = https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/policy/world-abortion-policies-2013.shtml | accessdate = 3 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Agricultural marketing ''' is inferred to cover the services involved in moving an [[agricultural]] product from the [[farm]] to the [[consumer]]. It is also the planning, organizing, directing and handling of agricultural produce in such a way as to satisfy the farmer, producer and the consumer. Numerous interconnected activities are involved in doing this, such as planning production, growing and [[harvesting]], [[Food grading|grading]], [[Food packaging|packing and packaging]], transport, [[Food storage|storage]], agro- and [[food processing]], [[Food distribution|distribution]], [[advertising]] and sale. Effectively, the term encompasses the entire range of supply chain operations. However, its key function is to help direct these services, by providing competent and able market information, thereby linking the other operations into an integrated service with targeted outcomes.

==Agricultural marketing development==
[[File:Adjamemarche2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Congestion at a market in [[Abidjan]]]]
[[Image:Mercado de Xipamanine Maputo Moçambique.png|thumb|right|250px|A typical market in Africa]]
Efforts to develop agricultural marketing have, particularly in developing countries, tended to concentrate on a number of areas, specifically infrastructure development; information provision; training of farmers and traders in marketing and post-harvest issues; and support to the development of an appropriate policy environment. In the past, efforts were made to develop government-run marketing bodies but these have tended to become less prominent over the years.&lt;ref name="AbbottNations1986"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbott|first1=John Cave|author2=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|title=Marketing Improvement in the Developing World: What Happens and what We Have Learned|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-1I-W3lvIsC&amp;pg=PA3|year=1986|publisher=Food &amp; Agriculture Org.|isbn=978-92-5-101427-1|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural Market infrastructure===
Efficient marketing infrastructure such as [[wholesale marketing|wholesale]], retail and assembly markets and [[Warehouse|storage]] facilities is essential for cost-effective marketing, to minimize [[post-harvest handling|post-harvest losses]] and to reduce health risks. Markets play an important role in [[rural development]], income generation, [[food security]], and developing rural-market linkages. Experience shows that planners need to be aware of how to design markets that meet a community's social and economic needs and how to choose a suitable site for a new market. In many cases sites are chosen that are inappropriate and result in under-use or even no use of the infrastructure constructed. It is also not sufficient just to build a market: attention needs to be paid to how that market will be managed, operated and maintained.&lt;ref name="Tracey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-y4851e.HTM|title=Planning and Designing Rural Markets|author=Tracey-White, John|date=2003|location=Rome|publisher=Food And Agrilculture Organization Of The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ags/publications/AGSF_WD_24.pdf|title=A guide to upgrading rural agricultural retail markets|author=Marocchino, Cecilia|date=2009|location=Rome|publisher=Food And Agrilculture Organization Of The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rural assembly markets are located in production areas and primarily serve as places where farmers can meet with traders to sell their products. These may be occasional (perhaps weekly) markets, such as haat bazaars in India and Nepal, or permanent.&lt;ref name = "Tracey"/&gt; Terminal wholesale markets are located in major metropolitan areas, where produce is finally channelled to consumers through trade between wholesalers and retailers, caterers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tracey-White John | title= Wholesale markets: Planning and Design Manual|url= http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0521e/t0521e00.htm |publisher=FAO|location= Rome| accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristics of [[wholesale market]]s have changed considerably as retailing changes in response to urban growth, the increasing role of supermarkets and increased consumer spending capacity. These changes may require responses in the way in which traditional wholesale markets are organized and managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Reardon T. | author2= Timmer P.|author3= Berdegue J.|title= The Rapid Rise of Supermarkets in Developing Countries: Induced Organizational, Institutional, and Technological Change in Agrifood Systems|url= https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6557502.pdf|publisher=electronic Journal of Agricultural and Development Economics|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retail marketing systems in western countries have broadly evolved from traditional street markets through to the modern hypermarket or out-of-town shopping center. In developing countries, there remains scope to improve agricultural marketing by constructing new retail markets, despite the growth of supermarkets, although municipalities often view markets primarily as sources of revenue rather than infrastructure requiring development. Effective regulation of markets is essential. Inside a market, both hygiene rules and revenue collection activities have to be enforced. Of equal importance, however, is the maintenance of order outside the market. Licensed traders in a market will not be willing to cooperate in raising standards if they face competition from unlicensed operators outside who do not pay any of the costs involved in providing a proper service.&lt;ref&gt;Tracey-White, J. [http://www.fao.org/docrep/V8390E/V8390E00.htm] Retail markets planning guide. FAO, Rome, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market information===
{{Main|Marketing information system}}
Efficient [[Market Information Systems|market information]] can be shown to have positive benefits for farmers and traders. Up-to-date information on prices and other market factors enables farmers to negotiate with traders and also facilitates spatial distribution of products from rural areas to towns and between markets.&lt;ref&gt;Aparajita Goyal  [http://www.aeaweb.org/issue.php?journal=APP&amp;volume=2&amp;issue=3], Information, Direct Access to Farmers, and Rural Market Performance in Central India, July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Most governments in developing countries have tried to provide [[Market Information Systems|market information services]] to farmers, but these have tended to experience problems of sustainability. Moreover, even when they function, the service provided is often insufficient to allow commercial decisions to be made because of time lags between data collection and dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew W. Shepherd  [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/003/X6993E/], Market information services – Theory and Practice. FAO, Rome, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern communications technologies open up the possibility for market information services to improve information delivery through [[Short message service|SMS]] on cell phones and the rapid growth of [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio stations in many developing countries offers the possibility of more localised information services. In the longer run, the internet may become an effective way of delivering information to farmers. However, problems associated with the cost and accuracy of data collection still remain to be addressed. Even when they have access to market information, farmers often require assistance in interpreting that information. For example, the market price quoted on the radio may refer to a wholesale selling price and farmers may have difficulty in translating this into a realistic price at their local assembly market.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew W. Shepherd  [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/012/x8826e/x8826e00.pdf], Understanding and Using Market Information. FAO, Rome, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Various attempts have been made in developing countries to introduce commercial market information services but these have largely been targeted at traders, commercial farmers or exporters. It is not easy to see how small, poor farmers can generate sufficient income for a commercial service to be profitable although in India a new service introduced by [[Thomson Reuters]] was reportedly used by over 100,000 farmers in its first year of operation. [[Esoko]] in West Africa attempts to subsidize the cost of such services to farmers by charging access to a more advanced feature set of mobile-based tools to businesses.

===Marketing training===
Farmers frequently consider marketing as being their major problem. However, while they are able to identify such problems as poor prices, lack of transport and high post-harvest losses, they are often poorly equipped to identify potential solutions. Successful marketing requires learning new skills, new techniques and new ways of obtaining information. Extension officers working with ministries of agriculture or NGOs are often well-trained in agricultural production techniques but usually lack knowledge of marketing or post-harvest handling.&lt;ref&gt;Grahame Dixie [https://www.share4dev.info/ffsnet/documents/3628.pdf] Horticultural Marketing, Marketing Extension Guide 5, FAO, Rome, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enabling environments===
Agricultural marketing needs to be conducted within a supportive policy, legal, institutional, [[macroeconomics|macro-economic]], infrastructural and bureaucratic environment. Traders and others are generally reluctant to make investments in an uncertain policy climate, such as those that restrict imports and exports or internal produce movement. Businesses have difficulty functioning when their trading activities are hampered by excessive bureaucracy. Inappropriate law can distort and reduce the efficiency of the market, increase the costs of doing business and retard the development of a competitive private sector. Poor support institutions, such as [[agricultural extension]] services, [[municipality|municipalities]] that operate markets inefficiently and inadequate export promotion bodies, can be particularly damaging. Poor roads increase the cost of doing business, reduce payments to farmers and increase prices to consumers. Finally, [[Political corruption|corruption]] can increase the transaction costs faced by those in the marketing chain.

===Agricultural marketing support===
Most governments have at some stage made efforts to promote agricultural marketing improvements. In the United States the [[Agricultural Marketing Service]] (AMS) is a division of [[USDA]] and has programs that provide testing, support standardization and grading and offer market news services. AMS oversees marketing agreements and orders research and promotion programs. It also purchases commodities for federal food programs. USDA also provides support to agricultural marketing work at various universities. In the United Kingdom, support for marketing of some commodities was provided before and after the Second World War by boards such as the [[Milk Marketing Board]] and the [[Egg Marketing Board]]. These boards were closed down in the 1970s. As a colonial power, Britain established [[marketing board]]s in many countries, particularly in Africa. Some continue to exist although many were closed at the time of the introduction of [[structural adjustment]] measures in the 1990s.

Several developing countries have established government-sponsored marketing or agribusiness units. South Africa, for example, started the [http://www.namc.co.za/ National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC)] as a response to the deregulation of the agriculture industry and closure of marketing boards in the country. India has the long-established [[National Institute of Agricultural Marketing]]. These are primarily research and policy organizations, but other agencies provide facilitating services for marketing channels, such as the provision of infrastructure, market information and documentation support. Examples from the Caribbean include the [http://www.namdevco.com/ National Agricultural Marketing Development Corporation (NAMDEVCO)] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and the [http://www.newgmc.com/ New Guyana Marketing Corporation] in [[Guyana]].

===Recent developments===
New marketing linkages between [[agribusiness]], large retailers and farmers are gradually being developed, e.g. through [[contract farming]], group marketing and other forms of [[collective action]].&lt;ref&gt;Helen Markelova and Ruth Meinzen-Dick {{cite web|url=http://www.capri.cgiar.org/pdf/CA-Market_WksReport.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716224158/http://www.capri.cgiar.org/pdf/CA-Market_WksReport.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-16 |df= }} Collective action and market access for smallholders: A summary of findings. CAPRi/IFPRI 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
Donors and NGOs are paying increasing attention to ways of promoting direct linkages between farmers and buyers&lt;ref&gt;Andrew W. Shepherd [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/a1123e/a1123e00.pdf] Approaches to linking producers to markets. FAO, Rome, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; within a value chain context. More attention is now being paid to the development of regional markets (e.g. East Africa) and to structured trading systems that should facilitate such developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CTA and EAGC|title=Structured grain trading systems in Africa|url=http://publications.cta.int/media/publications/downloads/1749_PDF.pdf|publisher=CTA|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of [[supermarkets]], particularly in Latin America and East and South East Asia, is having a significant impact on marketing channels for horticultural, dairy and livestock products.&lt;ref&gt;Reardon, T., C.P. Timmer, C.B. Barrett, J. Berdegue. “The Rise of Supermarkets in Africa, Asia, and Latin America,” American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 85 (5), December 2003: 1140-1146.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, “spot” markets will continue to be important for many years, necessitating attention to infrastructure improvement such as for retail and [[wholesale marketing|wholesale markets]].

'''Brisbane Water''' was a former [[government business enterprise]] of the [[Brisbane City Council]], a [[Local government in Australia|local government authority]] with administrative responsibility for the [[City of Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], in [[Australia]]. Brisbane Water was responsible for the distribution of reticulated [[potable water]] throughout Brisbane, as well as the [[water treatment|treatment]] and [[pipeline transport|transport]] of [[water supply|bulk water]] to the local government areas of Brisbane City, [[Ipswich City]], [[Logan City]], [[Redcliffe City]], [[Pine Rivers Shire]] and [[Caboolture Shire]]. Brisbane Water operated the city's reticulated [[Effluent sewer|sewer]]age network and associated [[treatment plant]]s.

On 1 July 2010 the functions of Brisbane Water were formally assumed by the [[Queensland Urban Utilities]], a [[statutory authority]] of the [[Government of Queensland]], with shares resting in the local government authorities of Brisbane, Ipswich, Lockyer Valley, Scenic Rim, and Somerset councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanutilities.com.au/about-us/who-we-are|title=Who we are|work=|publisher=[[Queensland Urban Utilities]]|date=2014|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Brisbane Water ceased operating as a business unit of Brisbane Council as part of a restructure introduced by the then [[Lord Mayor of Brisbane|Lord Mayor]], [[Campbell Newman]]. The division was renamed initially as Brisbane City Council - Water Distribution.

In 2008, BCC - Water Distribution transitioned bulk water treatment and transport assets, functions and some staff to newly created Queensland state government water authorities, with the government's Southeast Qld Water Reforms enforced by the {{Cite Legislation AU|QLD|act||South East Queensland Water (Restructuring) Act 2007}}.  From late 2009, the BCC - Water Distribution division changed its trademark temporarily to Queensland Urban Utilities, as part of a phased transition into the final stage of previously announced state government water reforms requiring local councils to transition remaining water and sewerage distribution and collection functions into new entities, with the transition enforced by the {{Cite Legislation AU|QLD|act||South-East Queensland Water (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) Act 2009}}.

On 1 July 2010, Brisbane City Council ceased operating under the Queensland Urban Utilities trademark, with water distribution, and sewerage collection and treatment assets, functions and staff transitioned to the new Queensland Urban Utilities, a distributor-retailer statutory authority jointly owned by five local Councils. Simultaneously, the neighbouring distributor-retailers of UnityWater and AllConnex also commenced operations.

In the United States, '''civil confinement''' is a term for the formal legal process by which persons convicted of certain sexual offenses (generally violent [[sex offender]]s) may be subject to [[involuntary commitment]] upon completion of a prison sentence.

== Legal process ==

Although the exact details of the legal process may vary from state to state, the [[United States Supreme Court]] reviewed and upheld as constitutional a statutory process adopted in Kansas. See ''[[Kansas v. Hendricks]]'', 521 U.S. 346 (1997). There, civil confinement proceedings could be initiated against "any person who has been convicted of or charged with a sexually violent offense and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in the predatory acts of sexual violence." Many of those terms were themselves defined in the statute, including "mental abnormality," defined as "congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity which predisposes the person to commit sexually violent offenses in a degree constituting such person a menace to the health and safety of others." ''Id''.

If a prison identified an inmate who was about to be released but potentially fit this definition, the prison authorities were required to notify the local prosecutor of the impending release. The prosecutor was then required to decide whether to petition for commitment. The court would then have to determine whether probable cause existed to support the inmate's status as a "sexually violent predator," and, upon such a determination, order the inmate to be psychologically evaluated. The psychological evaluation would then form the basis of a further trial to determine whether the inmate qualified as a violent sexual predator. Upon such a determination, the inmate would be subject to involuntary commitment at a medical facility until such time as his mental abnormality had changed and it was safe to release him.'' Id''. at 353. The court would then be required to conduct an annual review of the determination, and the inmate would always be allowed to petition for freedom under the same standards. The Supreme Court concluded that this process met previously established standards of constitutional [[substantive due process]] governing voluntary confinement, did not constitute [[double jeopardy]] because the proceedings were civil rather than criminal, and was not an ex post facto law for the same reason. ''Id''. at 353-371. In a following case, the United States Supreme Court clarified that the government must demonstrate that the inmate has at least a serious lack of ability to control his behavior. ''[[Kansas v. Crane]]'' 534 U.S. 407 (2002). The Supreme Court has also determined that Congress has the authority to pass a similar law affecting federal prisoners. ''[[United States v. Comstock]]'', 560 U.S. 126 (2010).

Twenty states have civil commitment facilities, as of 2018.&lt;ref name=mail &gt;{{cite news

== Controversy ==

As with [[civil commitment]] generally, civil confinement is a controversial implementation of state power. Detractors point to the prospect of indefinite detention without due process of law.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., David Rosen, "Sex Offenders, Civil Confinement and the Resurrection of Evil: The New Disappeared," May 10, 2007, [http://www.counterpunch.org/rosen05102007.html Counterpunch] ("Civil confinement permits the state to transform a criminal sentence with a specified duration into an indeterminate life sentence.") Accessed January 24, 2008; Mark K. Matthews, "Molesters confined even after jail time is up" [http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=87312 State Line] ("When the most dangerous sexual predators are due to leave prison ... officials can revoke their freedom and toss them into mental hospitals indefinitely.") Accessed January 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents cite public safety.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Don Esmonde, "No mercy due 100-year-old pedophile," December 13, 2009, [http://www.buffalonews.com/donnesmonde/story/892797.html The Buffalo News]. Accessed December 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

State legislatures who have decided to adopt civil confinement statutes have expressed the intent of the laws in their enactments. One example is the state of Washington, which explained:

:The legislature finds that a small but extremely dangerous group of sexually violent predators exist who do not have a mental disease or defect that renders them appropriate for the existing involuntary treatment act . . . which is intended to be a short-term civil commitment system that is primarily designed to provide short-term treatment to individuals with serious mental disorders and then return them to the community. In contrast to persons appropriate for civil commitment . . . sexually violent predators generally have personality disorders and/or mental abnormalities which are unamenable to existing mental illness treatment modalities and those conditions render them likely to engage in sexually violent behavior. The legislature further finds that sex offenders' likelihood of engaging in repeat acts of predatory sexual violence is high. The existing involuntary commitment act . . . is inadequate to address the risk to reoffend because during confinement these offenders do not have access to potential victims and therefore they will not engage in an overt act during confinement as required by the involuntary treatment act for continued confinement. The legislature further finds that the prognosis for curing sexually violent offenders is poor, the treatment needs of this population are very long term, and the treatment modalities for this population are very different than the traditional treatment modalities for people appropriate for commitment under the involuntary treatment act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.09.010 RCW 70.09.010].&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''composting toilet''' is a type of [[toilet]] that treats [[human waste|human excreta]] by a biological process called [[Compost|composting]]. This process leads to the [[decomposition]] of [[organic matter]] and turns human excreta into compost. It is carried out by microorganisms (mainly [[bacteria]] and [[Fungus|fungi]]) under controlled [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] conditions.&lt;ref name="tilley" /&gt; Most composting toilets use no water for flushing and are therefore "[[dry toilet|dry toilets]]". 

In many composting toilet designs, carbon additives such as [[sawdust]], [[Coir|coconut coir]], or [[Sphagnum|peat moss]] is added after each use. This practice creates air pockets in the human excreta to promote aerobic decomposition. This also improves the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and reduces potential [[odor]]. Most composting toilet systems rely on [[Mesophile|mesophilic]] composting. Longer retention time in the composting chamber also facilitates [[pathogen]] die-off. The end product can also be moved to a secondary system – usually another composting step – to allow more time for mesophilic composting to further reduce pathogens.

Composting toilets, together with the secondary composting step, produce a [[humus]]-like endproduct that can be used to enrich soil if local regulations allow this. Some composting toilets have [[urine diversion]] systems in the toilet bowl to collect the urine separately and control excess moisture. A "[[vermifilter]] toilet" is a composting toilet with flushing water where [[Earthworm|earthworms]] are used to promote decomposition to compost.

Composting toilets do not require a connection to [[septic tank]]s or [[Sanitary sewer|sewer systems]] unlike [[Flush toilet|flush toilets]].&lt;ref name="tilley" /&gt; Common applications include [[national parks]], remote holiday cottages, [[ecotourism]] resorts, [[Off-the-grid|off-grid homes]] and rural areas in [[Developing country|developing countries]].

== Terminology ==
[[File:Schematic of the composting chamber.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Schematic of the composting chamber which is located below the toilet seat&lt;ref name="tilley"&gt;{{cite book|isbn = 978-3-906484-57-0|url = http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/454|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies - (2nd Revised Edition)|author1=Tilley, E. |author2=Ulrich, L. |author3=Lüthi, C. |author4=Reymond, Ph. |author5=Zurbrügg, C. |publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland|page = 72}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The term "composting toilet" is used quite loosely, and its meaning varies by country. For example, in Germany and Scandinavian countries, composting always refers to a predominantly aerobic process. This aerobic composting may take place with an increase in temperature due to microbial action, or without a temperature increase in the case of slow composting or cold composting. If earth worms are used ([[vermicomposting]]) then there is also no increase in temperature.

Composting toilets differ from [[pit latrine]]s and [[arborloo]]s, which use less controlled decomposition and may not protect [[groundwater]] from nutrient or [[pathogen]] contamination or provide optimal nutrient recycling. They also differ from [[urine-diverting dry toilet]]s (UDDTs) where pathogen reduction is achieved through dehydration (also known by the more precise term "[[desiccation]]") and where the feces collection vault is kept as dry as possible. Composting toilets aim to have a certain degree of moisture in the composting chamber.

Composting toilets can be used to implement an [[ecological sanitation]] approach for [[resource recovery]], and some people call their composting toilet designs "ecosan toilets" for that reason. However, this is not recommended as the two terms (i.e. composting and ecosan) are not identical.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rieck"&gt;Rieck, C., von Münch, E., Hoffmann, H. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/874 Technology review of urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs) - Overview on design, management, maintenance and costs]. Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SelfContainedCompostingToiletDesign.png|thumb|Schematic of a composting toilet with [[urine diversion]]]]
Composting toilets have also been called "sawdust toilets", which can be appropriate if the amount of aerobic composting taking place in the toilet's container is very limited.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hill, B. G. (2013). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2138 An evaluation of waterless human waste management systems at North American public remote sites]. PhD thesis, University of British Columbia (Vancouver), Canada&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Clivus multrum]]" is a type of composting toilet which has a large composting chamber below the toilet seat and also receives undigested organic material to increase the carbon to nitrogen ratio.  Alternatives with smaller composting chambers are called "self-contained composting toilets" since the composting chamber is part of the toilet unit itself. 

== Applications ==
[[File:Nature Loo Waterless Composting Toilet Pedestal.jpg|thumb|This is the pedestal for a split-system composting toilet where collection/treatment chambers are located below the bathroom floor.]]
[[File:Composttoilet.jpg|thumb|Inexpensive do-it-yourself compost toilet at [[Dial House (Essex, England)|Dial House]], [[Essex]], [[England]], utilizing an old desk as the toilet unit.]]
[[File:Compostingtoilet.jpg|thumb|Public composting toilet at a highway rest facility in Sweden]]

Composting toilets can be suitable in areas such as a rural area or a park that lacks a suitable [[water supply]], [[sanitary sewer|sewers]] and [[sewage treatment plant|sewage treatment]]. They can also help increase the [[resilience (engineering and construction)|resilience]] of existing [[sanitation]] systems in the face of possible natural disasters  such as [[climate change]], [[earthquakes]] or [[tsunami]]. Composting toilets can reduce or perhaps eliminate the need for a [[septic tank]] system to reduce [[environmental footprint]] (particularly when used in conjunction with an on-site [[greywater treatment system]]).

These types of toilets can be used for [[resource recovery]] by reusing sanitized feces and urine as fertilizer and soil conditioner for gardening or ornamental activities.

===Components and use===
A composting toilet consists of two elements: a place to sit or [[Squatting position|squat]] and a collection/composting unit.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Berger, W. (2011). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/878 Technology review of composting toilets - Basic overview of composting toilets (with or without urine diversion).] Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; The composting unit consists of four main parts:&lt;ref name="tilley"/&gt;
* storage or composting chamber
* a ventilation unit to ensure that the degradation process in the toilet is predominantly aerobic and to vent odorous gases
* a leachate collection or urine diversion system to remove excess liquid
* an access door for extracting the compost
Many composting toilets collect urine in the same chamber as feces, thus they do not [[Urine diversion|divert urine]]. Adding small amounts of water that is used for [[anal cleansing]] is no problem for the composting toilet to handle.

Some composting toilets divert urine (and water used for anal washing) to prevent the creation of anaerobic conditions that can result from over saturation of the compost, which leads to odors and vector problems. Offering a [[waterless urinal]] in addition to the toilet can help keep excess amounts of urine out of the composting chamber.

=== Construction ===
The composting chamber can be constructed above or below ground level. It can be inside a structure or include a separate superstructure.

A drainage system removes [[leachate]]. Otherwise, excess moisture can cause anaerobic conditions and impede decomposition. Urine diversion can improve [[compost]] quality, since urine contains large amounts of [[ammonia]] that inhibits microbiological activity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ecompendium.sswm.info/sanitation-technologies/composting-chamber?group_code=s|title = The online Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies|date = 2014|accessdate = 2014-12-29|website = The online Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies|publisher = eawag aquatic research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Composting toilets greatly reduce human waste volumes through [[Psychrophile|psychrophilic]], [[Thermophile|thermophilic]] or [[Mesophile|mesophilic]] composting. Keeping the composting chamber insulated and warm protects the composting process from slowing due to low temperatures.

=== Odorous gases ===
The following gases may be emitted during the composting process that takes place in composting toilets: [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), [[ammonia]], [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Font|first1=Xavier|last2=Artola|first2=Adriana|last3=Sánchez|first3=Antoni|title=Detection, Composition and Treatment of Volatile Organic Compounds from Waste Treatment Plants|journal=Sensors|date=6 April 2011|volume=11|issue=12|pages=4043–4059|doi=10.3390/s110404043}}&lt;/ref&gt; These gases can potentially lead to complaints about odours. Some [[methane]] may also be present, but it is not odorous.

==Pathogen removal==
Excreta-derived compost recycles fecal nutrients, but it can carry and spread pathogens if the process of [[reuse of excreta]] is not done properly.

Internal pathogen destruction rates are usually low, particularly [[helminth]] eggs, such as [[Ascaris]] eggs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This carries the risk of spreading disease if a proper system management is not in place. Compost from human excreta processed under only mesophilic conditions or taken directly from the compost chamber is not safe for food production.&lt;ref&gt;Stenström, T.A., Seidu, R., Ekane, N., Zurbrügg, C. (2011). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1236 Microbial exposure and health assessments in sanitation technologies and systems] - EcoSanRes Series, 2011-1. Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Stockholm, Sweden, page 88&lt;/ref&gt; High temperatures or long composting times are required to kill helminth eggs, the hardiest of all pathogens. [[helminthiasis|Helminth infections]] are common in many [[developing countries]].

In [[thermophilic]] composting [[bacteria]] that thrive at temperatures  of {{Convert|40-60|C|F}} [[oxidize]] (break down) waste into its components, some of which are consumed in the process, reducing volume and eliminating potential [[pathogen]]s. To destroy pathogens, thermophilic composting must heat the compost pile sufficiently, or enough time (1–2 years) must elapse since fresh material was added that [[biology|biological]] activity has had the same pathogen removal effect.

One guideline claims that pathogen levels are reduced to a safe level by thermophilic composting at temperatures of 55&amp;nbsp;°C for at least two weeks or at 60&amp;nbsp;°C for one week.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An alternative guideline claims that complete pathogen destruction may be achieved already if the entire compost heap reaches a temperature of {{convert|62|°C|0}} for one hour, {{convert|50|°C|0}} for one day, {{convert|46|°C|0}} for one week or {{convert|43|°C|0}} for one month,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; although others regard this as overly optimistic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Design considerations ==
[[File:TerraNova Sitzdichtung (6211343544).jpg|thumb|Composting toilet with a seal in the lid in Germany]]

=== Environmental factors ===

Four main factors affect the decomposition process:&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;
* Sufficient oxygen is necessary for aerobic composting
* Moisture content from 45 to 70 percent (heuristically, "the compost should feel damp to the touch, with only a drop or two of water expelled when tightly squeezed in the hand".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;)
* Temperature between 40 and 50&amp;nbsp;°C (achieved through proper chamber dimensioning and possibly active mixing)
* [[Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio]] (C:N) of 25:1

=== Additives and bulking material ===
Human excreta and food waste do not provide optimum conditions for composting. Usually the water and nitrogen content is too high, particularly when urine is mixed with feces. Additives or "bulking material", such as wood chips, bark chips, sawdust, shredded dry leaves, ash and pieces of paper can absorb moisture. The additives improve pile aeration and increase the carbon to nitrogen ratio.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Bulking material also covers feces and reduces insect access. Absent sufficient bulking material, the material may become too compact and form impermeable layers, which leads to anaerobic conditions and odour.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Leachate management ===

[[Leachate]] removal controls moisture levels, which is necessary to ensure rapid, aerobic composting. Some commercial units include a urine-separator or [[urine diversion|urine-diverting]] system and/or a drain at the bottom of the composter for this purpose.

=== Aeration and mixing ===
Microbial action also requires oxygen, typically from the air. Commercial systems provide ventilation that moves air from the bathroom, through the waste container, and out a vertical pipe, venting above the roof. This air movement (via [[convection]] or fan forced) passes carbon dioxide and odors.

Some units require manual methods for periodic aeration of the solid mass such as rotating the composting chamber or pulling an "aerator rake" through the mass.

== Types ==
[[File:Local de compostage - composting unit (6150163178).jpg|thumb|External composting chamber of a composting toilet at a house in France]]
Commercial units and construct-it-yourself systems are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nesc.wvu.edu/pdf/WW/publications/eti/comp_toil_tech.pdf National Small Flows Clearinghouse, West Virginia University, Composting toilet technology]&lt;/ref&gt; Variations include number of composting vaults, removable vault, [[urine diversion]] and active mixing/aeration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Slow composting (or moldering) toilets ===
Most composting toilets use slow composting which is also called "cold composting". The compost heap is built up step by step over time.

The finished end product from "slow" composting toilets ("moldering toilets" or "moldering privies" in the US), is generally not free of pathogens. [[World Health Organization]] Guidelines from 2006 offer a framework for safe [[reuse of excreta]], using a multiple barrier approach.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;WHO (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater - Volume IV: Excreta and greywater use in agriculture]. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

Slow composting toilets  employ a passive approach. Common applications involve modest and often seasonal use, such as  remote trail networks. They are typically designed such that the materials deposited can be isolated from the operational part. The toilet can also be closed to allow further mesophilic composting.&lt;ref name="Alppal"&gt;Appalachian Trail Conservancy (2014). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2130 Backcountry Sanitation Manual, 2nd Edition]. Appalachian Trail Conservancy, Green Mountain Club, USDA Forest Service, National Park Service, USA&lt;/ref&gt; Slow composting toilets rely on long retention times for pathogen reduction and for decomposition of excreta or on the combination of time and/or the addition of [[Eisenia fetida|red wriggler worms]] for vermi-composting. Worms can be introduced to accelerate composting. Some jurisdictions of the US consider these worms as [[invasive species]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Active composters (self-contained) ===
"Self-contained" composting toilets compost in a container within the toilet unit. They are slightly larger than a [[flush toilet]], but use roughly the same floor space. Some units use fans for aeration, and optionally, heating elements to maintain optimum temperatures to hasten the composting process and to evaporate urine and other moisture. Operators of composting toilets commonly add a small amount of absorbent carbon material (such as untreated [[sawdust]], coconut [[coir]], [[peat moss]]) after each use to create air pockets to encourage aerobic processing, to absorb liquid and to create an odor barrier. This additive is sometimes referred to as "bulking agent". Some owner-operators use microbial "starter" cultures to ensure composting bacteria are in the process, although this is not critical.

=== Vermifilter toilet ===
A "[[vermifilter]] toilet" is a composting toilet with flushing water where [[Earthworm|earthworms]] are used to promote decomposition to compost. It can be connected to a [[Low-flush toilet|low-flush]] or a micro-flush toilet which uses about {{convert|500|ml|USoz}} per use. Solids accumulate on the surface of the filter bed while liquid drains through the filter medium and is discharged from the reactor. The solids (feces and toilet paper) are aerobically digested by aerobic bacteria and [[Vermicompost#Suitable species|composting earthworms]] into castings (humus), thereby significantly reducing the volume of organic material.&lt;ref name="Furlong2015"&gt;C. Furlong, W. T. Gibson, M. R. Templeton, M. Taillade, F. Kassam, G. Crabb, R. Goodsell, J. McQuilkin, A. Oak, G. Thakar, M. Kodgire, R. Patankar. [http://washdev.iwaponline.com/content/5/4/608 The development of an onsite sanitation system based on vermifiltration: the "Tiger Toilet"], Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development, January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
Some units employ roll-away containers fitted with aerators, while others use sloped-bottom tanks.

== Maintenance ==
Maintenance is critical to ensure proper operation, including odor prevention. Maintenance tasks include: cleaning, servicing technical components such as fans and removal of compost, leachate and urine. Urine removal is only required for those types of composting toilets using urine diversion.

Once composting is complete (or more often), the compost must be removed from the unit. How often this occurs is a function of container size, usage and composting conditions, such as temperature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Active, hot composting may span months only while passive, cold composting may require years. Properly managed units yield output volumes of about 10% of inputs.

== Uses of compost ==
[[File:Kiel-Hassee Erde mit Schubkarre (5708339858).jpg|thumb|Finished compost from a composting toilet ready for application as soil improvement in Kiel-Hassee, Germany]]
{{Main article|Uses of compost|Reuse of excreta}}
The material from composting toilets is a [[humus]]-like material, which can be suitable as a [[soil amendment]] for agriculture. Compost from residential composting toilets can be used in domestic gardens, and this is the main such use.

Enriching soil with compost adds substantial nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, carbon and calcium. In this regard compost is equivalent to many [[fertilizers]] and [[manures]] purchased in garden stores. Compost from composting toilets has a higher nutrient availability than the dried feces that result from a [[urine-diverting dry toilet]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Urine is typically present, although some is lost via leaching and evaporation. Urine can contain up to 90 percent of the residual [[nitrogen]], up to 50 percent of the [[phosphorus]], and up to 70 percent of the [[potassium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.gtz.de/Dokumente/oe44/ecosan/en-fighting-urine-blindness-1998.pdf J.O. Drangert, Urine separation systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222023233/http://www2.gtz.de/Dokumente/oe44/ecosan/en-fighting-urine-blindness-1998.pdf |date=2014-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compost]] derived from these toilets has in principle the same uses as compost derived from other organic waste products, such as [[sewage sludge]] or municipal organic waste. However, users of excreta-derived compost must consider the risk of pathogens.

===Pharmaceutical residues===
Excreta-derived compost may contain [[Prescription drug|prescription]] [[pharmaceuticals]]. Such residues are also present in conventional [[wastewater treatment]] effluent. This could [[groundwater pollution|contaminate groundwater]]. Among the medications that have been found in groundwater in recent years are [[antibiotic]]s, [[antidepressant]]s, [[blood thinner]]s, [[ACE inhibitor]]s, [[calcium-channel blocker]]s, [[digoxin]], [[estrogen]], [[progesterone]], [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]], [[Ibuprofen]], [[caffeine]], [[carbamazepine]], [[fibrate]]s and [[cholesterol]]-reducing medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Drugs in the Water |year= 2011|publisher= Harvard Health Letter |url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/Harvard_Health_Letter/2011/June/drugs-in-the-water}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 30% and 95% of pharmaceuticals medications are excreted by the human body. Medications that are [[lipophilic]] (dissolved in fats) are more likely to reach groundwater by leaching from fecal wastes. Wastewater treatment plants remove an average of 60% of these medications.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Quantitative Risk Analysis and Assessment, Volume 1, edited by Edward L. Melnick, Brian S. Veritt, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of medications degraded during composting of excreta has not yet been reported.

== Comparison ==

=== Pit latrines ===
{{Main|Pit latrine}}
Unlike [[pit latrine]]s, composting toilets convert feces into a dry, odorless material, avoiding the issues surrounding liquid fecal sludge management (e.g. odor, insects and disposal). These toilets minimize the risk of water pollution through the safe containment of feces in above-ground vaults, which allows the toilets to be sited in locations where pit-based systems are not appropriate.

However, composting toilets face higher capital costs (although lifecycle costs might be lower) and greater complexity (for instance, adding covering materials and managing moisture content).

=== Flush toilets ===
{{Main|Flush toilet}}
 	
Unlike [[flush toilet]]s, composting toilets do not dilute excreta and create [[wastewater]] streams which must be treated before disposal. On the other hand, wastewater treatment plants can centralize waste management for an entire community, with potentially greater efficiency.

=== Urine-diverting dry toilets ===
{{Main|Urine-diverting dry toilet}}
Composting toilets are more difficult to maintain than other types of dry toilets, like [[urine-diverting dry toilets]] (UDDT) with which they are often confused. This is due to the need to maintain a consistent and relatively high moisture content, as well as the relatively high complexity of composting toilets compared to UDDTs. Apart from that, composting toilets are quite similar to UDDTs, sharing many of the same advantages and disadvantages.

==History==
[[File:Henry Moule's earth closet, improved version c1875.JPG|thumb|[[Henry Moule]]'s earth closet, patented in 1873 (not a true composting toilet). Example from around 1875. Rear chamber for dispensing cover material]]
[[File:Moule's earth closet design, circa 1909.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Henry Moule]]'s earth closet design, circa 1909.]]

=== Dry earth toilet ===
Before the flush toilet became accepted in the late 19th century in developed countries, some inventors, scientists and [[public health]] officials supported the use of "dry earth closets", a type of [[dry toilet]] with similarities to composting toilets, but the collection vessel for the [[human waste|human excreta]] was not designed to compost. Dry earth closets were invented by English clergyman [[Henry Moule]], who dedicated his life to improving [[public sanitation]] after witnessing the [[cholera]] epidemics of 1849 and 1854. Impressed by the insalubrity of the houses, especially during the [[Great Stink]] in the summer of 1858, he invented what he called the 'dry earth system'.

In partnership with James Bannehr, he patented his device (No. 1316, dated 28 May 1860). Among his works bearing on the subject were ''The Advantages of the Dry Earth System ''(1868), ''The Impossibility overcome: or the Inoffensive, Safe, and Economical Disposal of the Refuse of Towns and Villages (''1870), The ''Dry Earth System'' (1871), ''Town Refuse, the Remedy for Local Taxation'' (1872), and ''National Health and Wealth promoted by the general adoption of the Dry Earth System'' (1873).

His system was adopted in private houses, in rural districts, in military camps, in many hospitals, and extensively in the [[British Raj]]. Ultimately, however, it failed to gain public support as attention turned to the water-flushed [[toilet]] connected to a sewer system.

In Germany, a similar dry toilet with a peat dispenser was marketed until after the second World War (it was called "Metroclo" and was manufactured by Gefinal, Berlin).

==== Germany ====
The regulations for composting toilets and other forms of dry toilets in Germany vary from state to state and from one application to another (e.g. use in allotment gardens or use in family homes and settlements). In the different states of Germany, it is the "Landesbauordnung" (translates to "state civil engineering regulations")  of the respective state that regulates the use of such alternative toilets.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Lorenz-Ladener|first1 = Hrsg.

Regulations governing the use of compost and urine from composting toilets is less clear in Germany but it seems generally allowed provided it is used on one's own property and not sold to third parties.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Finland ===

Numerous sparsely settled villages in rural areas in Finland are not connected to municipal [[water supply]] or sewer networks, requiring homeowners to operate their own systems. Individual private wells, i.e. shallow dug wells or boreholes in the bedrock, are often used for water supply, and many homeowners have opted for composting toilets. In addition, these toilets are common at holiday homes, often located near sensitive water bodies. For these reasons, many manufacturers of composting toilets are based in Finland, including Biolan, Ekolet, Kekkilä, Pikkuvihreä and Raita Environment.&lt;ref&gt;Global Dry Toilet Association of Finland (2011) [http://www.huussi.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Suomalaisetkk2011_web_spreads.pdf Dry Toilet Manufacturers in Finland], Leaflet in English and Finnish&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huussi.net/en/association/members-and-supporters/|title = Global Dry Toilet Association of Finland|date = |accessdate = 15 January 2015|website = Global Dry Toilet Association of Finland - Company and association members|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates made by leading Finnish composting toilet manufacturers and the Global Dry Toilet Association of Finland provided the following 2014 figures for composting toilet use in Finland:
* About 4% of single-family homes not connected to a public sewer network are equipped with a composting toilet.
* Some 200,000 manufactured composting toilets are thought to serve holiday homes, matched by the number of other dry toilets. The simplest ones are sited in an [[outhouse]].

Composting toilets have been successfully installed in houses with up to four floors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An estimate from 2008 put the number of composting toilets in households in Germany at 500.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Lorenz-Ladener|first1 = Hrsg.

Aufl.|url = http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1128|last2 = Berger|first2 = Wolfgang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these residences are also connected to a sewer system; the composting toilet was not installed due to a lack of sewer system but for other reasons, mainly because of an "ecological mindset" of the owners.

In Germany and Austria, composting toilets and other types of [[dry toilet]]s have been installed in single and multi-family houses (e.g. Hamburg, Freiburg, Berlin), ecological settlements (e.g. Hamburg-Allemöhe, Hamburg-Braamwisch, Kiel-Hassee, Bielefeld-Waldquelle, Wien-Gänserndorf) and in public buildings (e.g. Ökohaus Rostock, VHS-Ökostation Stuttgart-Wartberg, public toilets in recreational areas, restaurants and huts in the Alps, house boats and forest Kindergartens).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The ecological settlement in Hamburg-Allermöhe has had composting toilets since 1982. The settlement of 36 single-family houses with approximately 140 inhabitants uses composting toilets, [[rainwater harvesting]] and [[constructed wetlands]]. Composting toilets save about 40 litres of water per capita per day compared to a conventional flush toilet (10 liter per flush), which adds up to 2,044 m³ water savings per year for the whole settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Rauschning, G., Berger, W., Ebeling, B., Schöpe, A.

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Slow composting toilets have been installed by the [[Green Mountain Club]] in [[Vermont]]'s woodlands. They employ multiple vaults (called cribs) and a movable building. When one of the vaults fills, the building is moved over an empty vault. The full vault is left untouched for as long as possible (up to three years) before it is emptied. The large surface area and exposure to air currents can cause the pile to dry out. To counteract this, signs instruct users to urinate in the toilet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greenmountainclub.org/pdf/GMC_LTN_F13_web.pdf|title=Long Trail News: Quarterly of the Green Mountain Club, Fall 2013.

=== Worldwide ===
Composting toilets with a large composting container (of the type [[Clivus Multrum]] and derivations of it) are popular in US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Sweden. They can be bought and installed as commercial products, as designs for self builders or as "design derivatives" which are marketed under various names. It has been estimated that approximately 10,000 such toilets might be in use worldwide.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

A '''dry enema''' is an alternative technique for cleansing the human [[rectum]] either for reasons of health, or for sexual hygiene.  It is accomplished by squirting a small amount of sterile [[lubricant]] into the rectum, resulting in a [[bowel movement]] more quickly and with less violence than can be achieved by an oral [[laxative]].

It is called "dry" by contrast to the more usual [[enema|wet enema]], because no water is used.

==Techniques==

===Suppositories===
A rudimentary form of "dry" enema is the use of a non-medicated [[glycerin]] suppository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glycerin Suppository|url=http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/GuidetoCancerDrugs/glycerin-suppository|work=American Cancer Society|publisher=American Cancer Society, Inc|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, due to the relative hardiness of the [[suppository]] - necessary for its insertion into the human body - before the glycerin can act, it must be melted by the heat of the body, and hence it does not take effect for up to an hour. Often the [[hygroscopic]] glycerin irritates the sensitive [[Mucous membrane|membranes]] of the rectum resulting in forceful expulsion of the suppository without any [[laxative]] effects.

[[Image:Syringe.jpg|thumb|329px|A disposable syringe]]

===Lubrication injection===
A quicker form of the dry enema utilizes the [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] of a small amount of water-based [[lubricant]] such as [[KY Jelly]] into the rectum via a non-hypodermic [[syringe]], such as an oral syringe, or from some other source.  Then again since the glycerin itself is an effective producer of the desired [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] of the colonic muscles it is simpler - and more easily controlled - to introduce 5 - 10 cc of glycerin directly into the rectum.  Specialist syringes are available for this purpose but are hard to find.  An alternative is to use an enema [[nozzle]] which has an intake end which is compatible with a standard [[Syringe|hypodermic syringe]].  This allows the immediate [[Intraperitoneal injection|injection]] of the 5-10 ccs. required, and results can  be expected in 2–4 minutes.  Another alternative is to use a normal 5 or 10cc syringe inserted directly into the anus.  This needs to be done carefully to avoid scratching the anal passage.  The passage should be lubricated with [[sorbolene]] cream or any water-based lubricant.  Only a syringe with a Luer-slip should be used, not a [[Luer taper|Luer-lock tip]] (a syringe end molded to take a screw-on needle).  Penetration is better performed by the patient to eliminate any pain.  The patient should be encouraged to wait at least 15 minutes in order that [[peristalsis]] can reach the full length of the rectum, but many will find this impossible and this treatment should therefore be applied only when the facilities to evacuate are nearby.

The usual amount of lubricant applied is about 2 tsp (10 cc), which will produce a [[Defecation|movement]] in 30 minutes or less. The movement will be produced in a compact body, rather than in the more copious liquid form produced by a wet enema; and since no water is used, none will be retained higher up in the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], to be expelled at a later, and possibly inconvenient, time.

A further advantage of this technique for [[sexual hygiene]] is that any slight remaining traces of [[Feces|fecal material]] will - due to the presence of the lubricant - tend to adhere to the wall of the [[rectum]] rather than to any foreign object which may subsequently be inserted.

E-cigarettes produce particles, in the form of an aerosol.&lt;ref name="Cheng2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Offermann2014"&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 2014|title=The Hazards of E-Cigarettes|url=http://www.gocolumbiamo.com/Health/Documents/Offermann-Thehazardsofe-cigarettes.pdf|journal=ASHRAE Journal|volume=56|issue=6|last1=Offermann|first1=Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In physics, a vapor is a substance in the gas phase whereas an aerosol is a suspension of tiny particles of liquid, solid or both within a gas.&lt;ref name="Cheng2014" /&gt; The aerosol is made-up of liquid sub-micron particles of condensed vapor,&lt;ref name="Offermann2014" /&gt; which mostly consist of propylene glycol, glycerol, water, flavorings, nicotine, and other chemicals.&lt;ref name="FarsalinosPolosa2014" /&gt; This aerosol that is produces resembles cigarette smoke.&lt;ref name="Cheng2014" /&gt; After a puff, inhalation of the aerosol travels from the device into the mouth and lungs.&lt;ref name="Cheng2014" /&gt;

A 2014 review found that the particles emitted by e-cigarettes are comparable in size and number to particles in cigarette smoke, with the majority of them in the ultrafine range. The ultrafine particles can go deep in the lungs and then into the [[systemic circulation]]. Pulmonary toxicity may occur because metal nanoparticles can deposit in the lungs.&lt;ref name="Grana2014" /&gt; The review also found that fine particles can be chemically intricate and not uniform, and what a particle is made of, the exact harmful elements, and the importance of the size of the particle is mostly unknown.&lt;ref name="Grana2014" /&gt; They found that because these things are uncertain, it is not clear whether the ultrafine particles in e-cigarette vapor have health effects similar to those produced by traditional cigarettes.&lt;ref name="Grana2014" /&gt;

A 2014 WHO report found e-cigarettes release a lower level of particles than traditional cigarettes.&lt;ref name=WHOPosition2014&gt;{{cite web |last1=WHO |title=Electronic nicotine delivery systems |url=http://apps.who.int/gb/fctc/PDF/cop6/FCTC_COP6_10-en.pdf |pages=1–13 |accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable to a traditional cigarette, e-cigarette particles are tiny enough to enter the alveoli, enabling nicotine absorption.&lt;ref name="EbbertAgunwamba2015" /&gt; E-cigarettes companies assert that the particulates produced by an e-cigarette are too tiny to be deposited in the [[alveoli]].&lt;ref name="Dagaonkar2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dagaonkar RS|first1=R.S.|last2=Udwadi|first2=Z.F.|title=Water pipes and E-cigarettes: new faces of an ancient enemy|journal=Journal of the Association of Physicians of India|volume=62|issue=4|year=2014|pages=324–328|url=http://www.japi.org/april_2014/05_ra_water_pipes.pdf|pmid=25327035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exactly what [[electronic cigarette aerosol|comprises the vapor]] varies in composition and concentration across and within manufacturers.&lt;ref name="Cheng2014" /&gt; Different devices generate different particle sizes and cause different depositions in the [[respiratory tract]], even from the same nicotine liquid.&lt;ref name="Collaco2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collaco|first1=Joseph M.|title=Electronic Use and Exposure in the Pediatric Population|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|volume=169|issue=2|year=2015|pages=177–182|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2014.2898|pmid=25546699}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports in the literature have shown respiratory and cardiovascular effects by these smaller size particles, suggesting a possible health concern.&lt;ref name="AIHA2014" /&gt;

Since e-cigarettes have not been widely used long enough for evaluation, the long-term health effects from the second-hand vapor are not known.&lt;ref name="Grana2014" /&gt; There is insufficient data to determine the impact on [[public health]] from e-cigarettes.&lt;ref name="Callahan2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Callahan-Lyon|first1=P.|title=Electronic cigarettes: human health effects|journal=Tobacco Control|volume=23|issue=Supplement 2|year=2014|pages=ii36–ii40|issn=0964-4563|doi=10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2013-051470|pmid=24732161|pmc=3995250}}&lt;/ref&gt; The potential harm to bystanders from e-cigarettes is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lung.org/stop-smoking/tobacco-control-advocacy/federal/e-cigarettes.html | title=American Lung Association Statement on E-Cigarettes | publisher=American Lung Association | date=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because no long-term data is available.&lt;ref name="Hajek2014" /&gt;

Since e-cigarettes do not burn (or contain) tobacco, no [[side-stream smoke]] or any cigarette smoke is produced.&lt;ref name="Grana2014" /&gt; Only what is exhaled by e-cigarettes users enters the surrounding air.&lt;ref name="Hajek2014" /&gt; Exhaled vapor consists of nicotine and some other particles, primarily consisting of flavors, aroma transporters, glycerin and propylene glycol.&lt;ref name="Hajek2014" /&gt; Bystanders are exposed to these particles from exhaled e-cigarette vapor.&lt;ref name="Grana2014" /&gt; A mixture of harmful substances, particularly nicotine, ultrafine particles, and volatile organic compounds can be exhaled into the air.&lt;ref name="Cervellin2013" /&gt; The liquid particles condenses into a viewable fog.&lt;ref name="Bertholon2013" /&gt; The vapor is in the air for a short time, with a [[half-life]] of about 10 seconds; traditional cigarette smoke is in the air 100 times longer.&lt;ref name="Bertholon2013" /&gt; This is because of fast revaporization at room temperature.&lt;ref name="Bertholon2013" /&gt;

There is a concern that some of the mainstream vapor exhaled by e-cigarette users can be inhaled by bystanders, particularly indoors, and have significant adverse effects.&lt;ref name="Rom2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KleinstreuerFeng2013"/&gt; Since e-cigarettes involve an aerosolization process, it is suggested that no meaningful amounts of carbon monoxide are emitted.&lt;ref name="Nowak2014" /&gt; Thus, cardiocirculatory effects caused by carbon monoxide are not likely.&lt;ref name="Nowak2014" /&gt; However, in an experimental study, e-cigarettes increased levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the surrounding air.&lt;ref name="Nowak2014"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Nowak D, Jörres RA, Rüther T |title=E-cigarettes—prevention, pulmonary health, and addiction |journal=Dtsch Arztebl Int |volume=111 |issue=20 |pages=349–55 |year=2014 |doi=10.3238/arztebl.2014.0349 |url=http://www.aerzteblatt.de/int/archive/article?id=159697 |pmc=4047602 |pmid=24882626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

E-cigarettes used in indoor environments can put at risk nonsmokers to elevated levels of nicotine and aerosol emissions.&lt;ref name="Drummond2014" /&gt; Nonsmokers exposed to e-cigarette aerosol produced by a machine and pumped into a room were found to have detectable levels of the nicotine [[metabolite]] [[cotinine]] in their blood. The same study stated that 80% of nicotine is normally absorbed by the user, so these results may be higher than in actual second hand exposure.&lt;ref name="Grana2014" /&gt; In 2015 a report commissioned by Public Health England concluded that e-cigarettes "release negligible levels of nicotine into ambient air with no identified health risks to bystanders".&lt;ref name="McNeill201565" /&gt;

A 2014 review of limited data concluded this vapor can cause [[indoor air pollution]] and is not just water vapor as is frequently stated in the advertising of e-cigarettes.&lt;ref name="Grana2014" /&gt; A 2014 practice guideline by [[NPS MedicineWise]] states, "Although data on health effects of passive vapour are currently lacking, the risks are argued to be small, but claims that e-cigarettes emit only water vapour are nevertheless incorrect. Serum cotinine levels (a metabolite of nicotine) have been found to be similar in bystanders exposed to either e-cigarette vapour or cigarette smoke."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=e-Cigarettes: a safe way to quit?|url=http://www.nps.org.au/publications/health-professional/health-news-evidence/2014/e-cigarettes|publisher=NPS MedicineWise}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nps.org.au/publications/health-professional/health-news-evidence/2014/e-cigarettes|title=e-Cigarettes: a safe way to quit?|last=health|first=NPS: Better choices, Better|website=NPS MedicineWise|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 [[California Department of Public Health]] has reported that "Mainstream and second hand e-cigarette aerosol has been found to contain at least ten chemicals that are on [[California Proposition 65 (1986)|California's Proposition 65]] list of chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm."&lt;ref name="Chapman2015"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cdph.ca.gov/programs/tobacco/Documents/Media/State%20Health-e-cig%20report.pdf | title=State Health Officer's Report on E-Cigarettes: A Community Health Threat | publisher=California Department of Public Health, California Tobacco Control Program | date=January 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129015546/http://cdph.ca.gov/programs/tobacco/Documents/Media/State%20Health-e-cig%20report.pdf | archivedate=29 January 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been demonstrated that e-cigarettes causes nonusers to be exposed to nicotine but not to tobacco-related combustion toxicants.&lt;ref name="Rom2014" /&gt;

[[File:No Vaping Sign (18562436519).jpg|right|thumb|A no smoking or vaping sign from the US.]]A [[white paper]] published in 2014 by the [[American Industrial Hygiene Association]] concluded e-cigarettes emit airborne contaminants that may be inhaled by the user and those nearby.&lt;ref name="AIHA2014" /&gt; They urged indoors restrictions similar to smoking bans, until research has shown the aerosol has no risk of harm.&lt;ref name="AIHA2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=White Paper: Electronic Cigarettes in the Indoor Environment|url=http://tobacco.ucsf.edu/sites/tobacco.ucsf.edu/files/u9/AIHA-Electronc%20Cig%20Document_Final.pdf|publisher=American Industrial Hygiene Association|date=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review indicated that the levels of inhaled contaminants from the e-cigarette vapor are not of significant health concern for human exposures by the standards used in workplaces to ensure safety.&lt;ref name="Bur2014" /&gt; The use of e-cigarettes in a smoke-free area could expose non-users to toxins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Grana RA, Ling PM |title="Smoking revolution": a content analysis of electronic cigarette retail websites |journal=Am J Prev Med |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=395–403 |year=2014 |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2013.12.010 |pmid=24650842 |pmc=3989286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect on bystanders would likely be much less harmful than traditional cigarettes.&lt;ref name="Hajek2014" /&gt;

2014 WHO report stated passive exposure was as a concern, indicating that current evidence is insufficient to determine whether the levels of exhaled vapor are safe to involuntarily exposed bystanders.&lt;ref name="WHOPosition2014" /&gt; The report stated that "it is unknown if the increased exposure to toxicants and particles in exhaled aerosol will lead to an increased risk of disease and death among bystanders."&lt;ref name="WHOPosition2014" /&gt; The [[British Medical Association]] (BMA) reported in 2013 that there are "concerns that the use of e-cigarettes could threaten the norm of not smoking in public places and workplaces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bma.org.uk/news-views-analysis/news/2013/january/ecigarettes-not-proven-quitting-aid-says-bma | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226001907/http://bma.org.uk/news-views-analysis/news/2013/january/ecigarettes-not-proven-quitting-aid-says-bma | dead-url=yes | archive-date=26 February 2013 | title=E-cigarettes not proven quitting aid, says BMA | work=British Medical Association | date=30 January 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Asof|2013}}, the only clinical study currently published evaluating the respiratory effects of passive vaping found no adverse effects were detected.&lt;ref name=FarsalinosPolosa2014/&gt; A 2014 review found it is safe to infer that their effects on bystanders are minimal in comparison to traditional cigarettes.&lt;ref name=FarsalinosPolosa2014/&gt; A E-cigarette vapor has notably fewer toxicants than cigarette smoke and is likely to pose less harm to users or bystanders.&lt;ref name=Grana2014/&gt;

=== Third hand ===
E-cigarette use by a parent might lead to inadvertent health risks to offspring.&lt;ref name="England2015" /&gt; E-cigarettes pose many safety concerns to children.&lt;ref name=England2015/&gt; For example, indoor surfaces can accumulate nicotine where e-cigarettes were used, which may be inhaled by children, particularly youngsters, long after they were used.&lt;ref name=England2015/&gt; A policy statement by the American Association for Cancer Research and the American Society of Clinical Oncology has reported that "Third-hand exposure occurs when nicotine and other chemicals from second-hand aerosol deposit on surfaces, exposing people through touch, ingestion, and inhalation".&lt;ref name=Brandon2015/&gt; Public health England, looking at the available research said the amount of nicotine deposited was low and that an infant would have to lick 30 square meters to be exposed to 1&amp;nbsp;mg of nicotine.&lt;ref name="McNeill201565" /&gt; The statement noted there are no published studies of third hand exposure from e-cigarettes, however initial data suggests that nicotine from e-cigarettes may stick to surfaces and would be hard to remove.&lt;ref name=Brandon2015/&gt;

==E-liquid==

The two most common e-liquid bases are propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://esigaret-kopen.nl/e-cigarette|title=E-Cigarettes 95% Less Harmful Than Traditional Tobacco|website=esigaret-kopen.nl|language=nl|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Propylene glycol is tasteless and odorless, and therefore it doesn't affect the flavor of the e-liquid. It is known, however, to cause allergic reactions in some users, and in such case it is advised to stop the use immediately. Vegetable glycerin, on the other hand, is a lot thicker in consistency, and it doesn't cause allergic reactions. It also produces significantly more vapor, which has a slight sweet taste.&lt;ref name="eliquid2"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://vaperanks.com/propylene-glycol-vs-vegetable-glycerin-e-liquid-whats-the-difference|publisher = Ecigarette Mag|title = Propylene Glycol vs. Vegetable Glycerin E-Liquid – What's the Difference?|accessdate = 10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2016}}

=== Manufacturing ===
E-liquids are manufactured by many producers, both in the US and across the world.&lt;ref name=Blackwell2015/&gt; First tier manufacturers use lab suits, gloves, hair covers, inside of certified clean rooms with air filtration similar to pharmaceutical-grade production areas.&lt;ref name=Blackwell2015&gt;{{Cite web|title=Avail Vapor offers glimpse into the 'art and science' of e-liquids|url=http://www.richmond.com/business/local/article_9f65201a-94c0-51b1-9663-f9fbb5c522af.html|author=John Reid Blackwell|website=Richmond Times-Dispatch|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Standards ====
Standards for e-liquid manufacturing have been created by American E-liquid Manufacturing Standards Association (AEMSA), which is trade association dedicated to creating responsible and sustainable standards for the safe manufacturing of e-liquids used in vapor products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About AEMSA|url = http://www.aemsa.org/welcome-to-the-aemsa/|website = AEMSA|accessdate = 23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; AEMSA has published a comprehensive list standards and best known methods, which are openly available for use by any manufacturer of e-Liquids. The AEMSA standards cover nicotine, ingredients, sanitary manufacturing rooms, safety packaging, age restrictions, and labeling.&lt;ref name=AEMSA2015&gt;{{Cite book|title=E-Liquid Manufacturing Standards|url=http://www.aemsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AEMSA-Standards-v2.3.pdf|publisher=AMERICAN E-LIQUID MANUFACTURING STANDARDS ASSOCIATION (AEMSA)|year=2015|location=US|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulation ===
There are no current governmental or US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) manufacturing standards for e-liquid. The FDA has sought to regulate e-liquid through use of the [[Tobacco Control Act]], passed into law in 2009. In April 2014, the FDA issued its "Deeming" proposals for public comment, which would cover e-liquids manufacturing. The Final Rule, (in final form) giving the FDA authority to regulate e-liquids was released on May 5, 2016.&lt;ref name="FDA2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Rule Announcement|url=https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm499234.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a limit in the UK on the nicotine content, meaning the nicotine strength of any e-liquid cannot exceed 20&amp;nbsp;mg/mL (2.0%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/e-cigarettes-regulations-for-consumer-products|title=E-cigarettes: regulations for consumer products - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The European Pharmaceutical Students' Association (EPSA)''' is a non-profit, non-governmental, non-political and non-religious association which represents 45 Pharmacy Students' Associations from 37 countries, representing around 100.000 pharmacy students all around [[Europe]]. Its main objective is ''{{'}}to develop the interests and opinions of European pharmacy students and to encourage contact and collaboration between them{{'}}''. Actually, EPSA's motto '"Bringing Pharmacy, Knowledge and Students Together" reflects its will to promote the ideas and opinions of all the students of Pharmacy in Europe in order to improve the Education, the Pharmaceutical Profession and the Scientific Advances regarding Pharmacy.
EPSA has its headquarters in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], in PGEU's offices. The Vice President of External Affairs works permanently there, collaborating with the [[Pharmaceutical Group of the European Union]] in the promotion of the role of the pharmacist as key actor in public health. Before being settled in [[Brussels]], EPSA had its headquarters in [[Leiden]], [[The Netherlands]].

==History==
In 1978, the French Pharmacy Students' Association, ANEPF, invited students from other European countries to their Annual Congress in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]. The reason for this was to discuss the forthcoming European Community directives on the mutual recognition of pharmacy degrees and to compare studies between different countries. However, it turned out that this was more difficult than expected and required a longer time to be done. All participants expressed the need of further discussion between them. Therefore, it was proposed to the [[International Pharmaceutical Students' Federation]], IPSF, to establish a European Sub-Committee (ESC) to discuss this, something which was done later on that year in the IPSF Annual Congress held in [[Edinburgh]], United Kingdom.

The European Sub-Committee became independent 4 years later in 1982, changing its name to the European Pharmaceutical Students' Committee and was officially registered at the Tribunal d' Illkirch in France. The main purpose of this association was to work for the mutual recognition of pharmacy qualifications within Europe thus facilitating pharmacists, free movement.

EPSA got its present name ten years after its independence at the 15th Annual Congress in [[Helsinki]], Finland, and became official after the 16th Annual Congress in [[Tübingen]], Germany, in 1993.

==Structure==

===General Assembly===
According to the Terms of Reference and Standing Orders (TORSO), the highest decision-making body in EPSA is the General Assembly. General Assemblies are held twice a year, first during the Annual Congress in April, and then during the Autumn Assembly in October. This ensures a smooth running of the association whilst taking important decisions, including TORSO changes.
The Ordinary Members of EPSA have the right to vote in any ballot of the association. In order to do it is necessary for Ordinary Members to present Annual Congress and Autumn Assembly Liaison Secretaries Reports and to pay their membership fees.

===EPSA Team===
The EPSA Team is elected every year at EPSA's Annual Congress. Led by the Executive, the EPSA Team cooperates all year with EPSA's member organisations in order to achieve EPSA goals.

====Executive====

The EPSA Executive manages the affairs of the association, and leads the work made in the name of EPSA on multiple fields.

European Sub-Committee (ESC) began with only one executive member, the chairperson. However, as the work load increased the need for additional board members became apparent. The ESC board was originally chosen at IPSF Congress. However, from 1982 onward, due to IPSF and ECS division, the Executive was chosen for the first time in an ESC Congress. Until 1998, the Board (composed of President, Vice-President, Secretary and Treasurer) was elected at the congress, and the rest of the Executive appointed. From 1998 onwards the entire Executive was elected at the congress, and was assisted by a number of sub-committees.

After that, several changes were made in the Executive with the introduction of Vice-Presidents and Immediate Past President positions. The latest changes applied at Kraków's Annual Congress in 2010 after EPSA's restructuring. The actual structure of EPSA Executive is composed of 8 elected members and one appointed Immediate Past President. [[File:EPSA Team 2012.jpg|thumb|EPSA Team]]

====Educational Department====

The Educational Department is supervised by the Vice-President of Education, and consists of five coordinators. Each of them is responsible of leading the projects that fall under their domain.

====Public Relations Department====

EPSA has three coordinators who are responsible for taking care of the administrative and technical aspects of the association, as well as helping the VP of Public Relations in the communication field.

====Internal Affairs Department====

This brand new department was established during the Annual Congress in Budapest in 2014. Its coordinators are responsible for a good communication with the Reception Committees and the Alumni group.

====External Affairs Department====

EPSA has two coordinators who are working close together with the Vice President of External Affairs to ensure sustainable incomes to EPSA.

====Mobility Department====

The Mobility Department has one coordinator, who leads the IMP project.

====Parliamentary Council====

The Parliamentary Council is the supervising Authority of the Association, ensuring that all decisions taken are done according to the association's regulations and to intervene if not so. The Parliamentary Council is composed of three members and one of them is elected as Parliamentarian. Each member should be from a different country.

====Audit Committee====

The EPSA accounts shall be audited by the Audit Committee, which should present a statement to General Assembly. Audit Committee consists of at least two persons which are appointed by Parliamentary Council and should be preferably from different countries.

====Annual Congress Reception Committee Chairperson====

The EPSA Annual Congress is the most important activity in all EPSA calendar. This is an event organized by both EPSA and the hosting association. In order to ensure its success, a Reception Committee (RC) is established, which chaired by the RC Chairperson, who is appointed as an EPSA Official and invited to Executive meetings with the aim of ensuring good communication between the EPSA team and the RC and hence a successful event.

====Liaison Secretaries====
EPSA Liaison Secretaries are elected or appointed by Member Organizations and their main task is to insure the implementation of EPSA projects at a local level and establish the connection between the executive of the National Organization and EPSA Executive. Liaison Secretaries are Official Delegates with voting rights at General Assembly.

====Individual Mobility Project (IMP) Coordinator Board====
The IMP Coordinator Board works to benefit the development of the EPSA Individual Mobility Project (IMP) as a whole. It consists of a Central IMP Coordinator and of National/Local IMP Coordinators as representatives of every EPSA member organization that is participating in the Individual Mobility Project.
The IMP Central Coordinator is elected, as the other EPSA officials, in EPSA General Assembly while the National/Local IMP Coordinators are elected (or appointed) by the National/Local Association they are representing.

===Member organizations===
The EPSA Ordinary Member Organizations are National Pharmaceutical Students' Associations of countries within the geographical entity of Europe, which are recognised by the Council of Europe as independent countries. EPSA has also Associate Members – pharmaceutical students association that do not represent the majority of faculties in a country.

Thanks to their work EPSA has improved substantially to meet its aims with professionalism and excellence. The Honorary Life Members (HLMs) are elected by General Assembly with a two-thirds majority.

==Events==

===Annual Congress===
The annual EPSA congress is the biggest and most important event in the EPSA calendar and takes place usually in April. It is where all EPSA members have the opportunity to meet and discuss EPSA and the Pharmacy Profession in General. The EPSA Annual Congress gathers an Educational Program (workshops and trainings), Social Program and the first EPSA General Assembly of the year is held during this event. EPSA Annual Congress is 7 days and 6 nights long. [[Toulouse]], [[France]] was elected as the host city for the next Annual Congress in 2015.
This is a chance for delegates from all the member organizations to come together to refuel their spirits and enthusiasm for the coming year. During the Annual Congress the new team of EPSA is elected for a one-year mandate by Ordinary Members of EPSA.

===Autumn Assembly===
The EPSA Autumn Assembly is EPSA's second most important event and takes place usually in October. The purpose of the EPSA Autumn Assembly is to provide an opportunity for EPSA members to review the work of the association halfway through the year and at the same time to renew motivation and commitment to EPSA. The second EPSA General Assembly of the year is held during Autumn Assembly.
From 2004 to 2008, the EPSA Autumn Assembly was organised in collaboration with ESCP (European Society of Clinical Pharmacy) in an association of three events: the EPSA Annual 2nd Congress, the EPSA/ESCP Student Symposium and the ESCP Symposium.
In the year of 2009 EPSA organised for the first time this event in collaboration with DIA ([[Drug Information Association]]).
The next Autumn Assembly will be held in St. Julians, Malta, in October 2015.

===Summer University===
The Summer University is the third main EPSA event of the year and takes place usually in the end of July. This event is characterized by an educational and social agenda. Unlike the others events of EPSA already mentioned, during the Summer University is not held any EPSA General Assembly. The 17th edition of the Summer University will take place in the beautiful city of Lisbon, in Portugal, in July 2015.

[[File:European Pharmaceutical Students Association Annual Reception.jpg|thumb|European Pharmaceutical Students Association Annual Reception]]

===Annual reception===
The Annual Reception (AR) is organised every year usually in February in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], in EPSA headquarters. The main aim of this event is for the EPSA team to present their work and projects to EPSA Board of Trustees, Partners and any institution which may be interested in EPSA's work. This event is structured in such a way as to have a round table discussion, chaired by EPSA President, in order to improve EPSA work and projects with the experience and ideas of these professionals.
The topic of Annual Reception is chosen every year by EPSA Executive.

===WHSS – World Healthcare Students' Symposium===
The WHSS is a multi-professional four-day conference bringing together healthcare students from all around the world.
The first joint symposium of world healthcare students took place in [[Malta]] from 7 to 12 November 2005. The symposium brought together 230 medical, pharmacy and nursing students from 42 countries in an international forum. The conference was intended to generate understanding and discussion between the professions, develop skills and awareness of concepts in multidisciplinary settings, and to create student advocates for a cooperative multidisciplinary approach to patient centred care to optimise health outcomes.
There are a number of groups who work together to make this event happen which includes, obviously, EPSA. The other students' associations involved are: International Federation of Medical Students' Associations (IFMSA), [[International Pharmaceutical Students' Federation]] (IPSF), European Nursing Students' Association (ENSA), International Council of Nurses – Student Network (ICN-SN) and European Medical Students' Association (EMSA).
Last WHSS was held in November 2013, in Lausanne, Switzerland.

==Publications==
[[File:EPSA NWL.jpg|130px|thumb|right|EPSA Newsletter.]]

===Newsletter===
The EPSA Newsletter is the official EPSA publication. It is published three times a year, and is distributed to all EPSA members, contact organizations and sponsors. The Newsletter contains articles from the EPSA Officials, members and professionals and aims to spread EPSA's latest developments regarding its projects and to exchange knowledge and experiences between them. Including a broad variety of topics, it also contributes to the communication between students of member countries, who want to share ideas, comments and experiences. Additionally, it serves to highlight the important issues for pharmacy students across Europe and to pass information about future events.
Each EPSA member association receives copies of the Newsletter that are further distributed to students across Europe, as well as to EPSA Observers and professional associations, in a total of 400 copies per edition.

[[File:Information Letter.jpg|120px|thumb|left|Information Letter.]]

===Monthly Dose===
The EPSA Monthly Dose aims to bring relevant and useful updates about EPSA to students that are not very familiar with the association. It is published every month by the Publications Coordinator and contains information about relevant projects in EPSA and its member associations, upcoming events and recently published blog articles and publications. The Monthly Dose is sent by e-mail to all students, teachers and professionals that subscribe EPSA News e-group on the EPSA website and is also available as a printed version in the European faculties of pharmacy.

===Report Booklet===
The Report Booklet is published every year and it aims to present the conclusions taken by EPSA team during its mandate. This includes the conclusions taken from workshops, together with the result of the EPSA Annual Questionnaire and Statements of Opinion. The Immediate Past President is responsible to make this compilation and publish it.
It is sent out to all students, professional and governmental organisations, EPSA members and all the faculties of pharmacy in Europe. As an official document of the association it states what European Pharmacy Students believe regarding a specific issue.

===Social networks===
EPSA also uses several social networks daily, such as Facebook, Twitter, and the EPSA blog to reach its students and provide them with updated information about its activities.

==Projects==

===Annual Topic===
Every year, the EPSA Annual Topic is voted by the General Assembly at the Annual Congress. The main purpose for the Annual Topic is to provide accurate information to European students for them to be able to gain valuable knowledge on the topic. To achieve this level of knowledge, EPSA will provide them with conferences by international speakers throughout the year, using the Annual Topic as a connecting thread between its events. All of the important information will be summarized in the Report Booklet at the end of the year.
This year 2010/2011, the Annual Topic voted at Kraków Annual Congress is ''Pharmacovigilance: Keeping our eyes open and our medicines safe''. It was chosen wisely, following EPSA's former Annual Topics regarding ''Information to Patients'' and ''Patents, Generics and Counterfeits'', in order to complete the Pharmaceutical package.

[[File:EPSA IMP logo.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Individual Mobility Project.]]

===Individual Mobility Project (IMP)===
The EPSA Individual Mobility Project is a long term project that gives the opportunity to students of pharmacy, particularly those in their late years of studies, and recent-graduates of pharmacy or pharmaceutical sciences from all European countries (members of EPSA) to gain an additional real-time work or experience, mainly  in the fields of research and industry. Consequently, the IMP represents a unique opportunity for students and recent graduates to also in gain valuable knowledge of other European countries, customs, cultures as well as learning and getting to know the European diversity, which are the experiences encouraged also by the [[European Commission]].
This project allows the student or graduate to gain experience, knowledge, of the working practices and research techniques from the host company / institution in a project that can last between 2 and 12 months.

===EPSA Voyage===
[[File:EPSA Voyage.jpg|120px|thumb|left|EPSA Voyage]]
Voyage is an online platform consisting of profiles of individuals with basic information about an accommodation or service which they provide.

The platform enables each EPSA member to register, make a profile and offer e.g. their free bed or several beds. Any registered user may contact other Voyage users and hopefully arrange their stay at his or her place. For more information about EPSA Voyage it is best to visit Voyage website and see and try out the system on your own: [http://www.epsa-online.org/voyage www.epsa-online.org/voyage].

Voyage is an excellent opportunity to meet people with a focus similar to yours within the world of pharmacy. It gives a chance for cooperation and enables both parties to benefit from meeting new people whether sharing experiences or using her or his guest bed at a newly met foreign friend's house.

===Annual Questionnaire===
Each year, the topic of the Annual Questionnaire is chosen and questions concerning all fields related to this topic are included in the questionnaire which is then distributed to all member organizations to hand out to students.  The results derived are then presented to professional organizations. This year, the topic for the annual questionnaire is ''Learning across Health professions - Multidisciplinary and Interdisciplinary Aspects of Pharmacy Education''.

===Lifelong Learning Certificate===
The EPSA Lifelong Learning Certificate provides pharmacy students who actively participate in professional and educational activities organized or promoted by EPSA, the opportunity to gain tangible credit for these activities. It also introduces, at an early stage in the development of these future healthcare professionals, the important principles of Lifelong Learning as well as establishing the importance of documenting professional activities.  The Certificate is granted to those who achieve 5 Lifelong Learning Points in one year (from April to March). The points can be obtained by attending the educational aspect of EPSA events or by attending an EPSA approved education project at a local level.

[[File:EPSAtrainer logo.jpg|110px|thumb|left|EPSA Training.]]

===Training project===
This new concept was introduced in 2005, and is led within EPSA by the Training Coordinator. Through Training events, students' knowledge on topics usually not included in the classical Pharmacy education (e.g. project management, communication and counseling skills) is improved by providing them training during EPSA events.

At a further stage, the most motivated and promising students can participate to the "Training New Trainers" event (TNT) in May, which will allow them to acquire strong leadership skills, and make them a part of the EPSA Training Team. They will consequently be able to train other students, spreading this knowledge to others at local/national events. The Training Project has the support from the European Commission, which can provide grants to organize such events through the Youth in Action Programme.

===oBIGsity===
The oBIGsity Project aims to make people aware of the increasing rate of obesity cases. This disease is found among both women and men at different ages. Students and people in general should know the consequences of this condition and most importantly how to prevent it.

Students' associations can participate by having a booth organized, where volunteer students will spread fliers and information regarding obesity (causes, treatment, how to avoid). If a video-projector will be available, some short videos can be displayed. At the university's cafeteria each sandwich will be given together with an apple, to promote health food!

===EPSA Student Guide===
This project aims to create an online database with all relevant information to EPSA and its members. This database will be available on EPSA official website and can be accessed by all pharmacists' students around Europe. It will contain information about the differences between the pharmacy course around Europe (number of year of studies, curricula, etc.), the profession itself (list of pharmacy organizations that exist in the country, health institutions, number of pharmacists in each country, etc.) and also the main characteristics of the country (currency, weather, life cost, etc.). With this project EPSA will create platform where students can find all information that they need about the country where they are going to experience a mobility project.
All information collected by EPSA team during its mandate will be saved and organized on this database.

===EPSA Alumni Database===
Since the foundation of EPSA many students have spent much of their time working for the association. The EPSA Alumni project aims to link the current EPSA team and members to the old ones, in order to make EPSA grow with the advice, expertise and great example of these people. This project offers the opportunity to maintain contact with all EPSA enthusiasts and also to keep the alumni benefiting from the association who they have given a lot of time and energy to. The alumni officer is in charge of contacting all alumni in order to gather their expertise and include them in trainings database.
This project aims to create an alumni weekend during EPSA Annual Congress, an alumni magazine, a section on EPSA official website dedicated to this issue and also an online platform with all important and relevant information regarding alumni – the EPSA Alumni Database.

===TWINNET Project===
The Twinnet Project aims to connect students from different countries and also to provide them an extracurricular knowledge during a short period of time. The Team Mobility Project includes TWIN (bilateral), THREEN (three lateral) and Multilateral (QUATRINO, MULTI-Exchange Projects) student projects among different associations.
The Vice President of Mobility ensures that the project is being taken properly and the Grant Coordinator helps Liaison Secretaries finding European Grants to support these mobility projects.

==EPSA in European Union==
The [[European Union]] is more than just a confederation of countries, but it is not a federal state. The EU policies in general, are the result of decisions taken by the institutional triangle made up of the Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission, all based in [[Brussels]] (the EU Parliament hold also in [[Strasbourg]] a plenary every month).

*The [[Council of the European Union]], representing national governments, is the EU's main decision-making body. The EU member states take it in turns to hold the Council Presidency for a six-month period. Every Council meeting is attended by one minister from each EU country.
*The [[European Parliament]] is the elected body that represents the EU's citizens. It exercises political supervision over the EU's activities and takes part in the legislative process.
*The [[European Commission]], a body independent of EU governments that upholds the collective European interest, is the third part of the institutional triangle that manages and runs the European Union. The Commission is assisted by a civil service made up of 36 directorates-general (DGs) and services.
* The [[European Council]],which became an official Institution with the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], defines the general political directions and priorities of the European Union and provides the necessary impetus for its development. It consists of the heads of state or government of the member states, together with its President and the President of the European Commission.

More than 70% of national law is based on decisions taken in [[Brussels]]. EU citizens are finding more and more that their lives are shaped by regulations established in Brussels. Companies and Associations in the European Union increasingly recognise the importance of lobbying at European level. Consequentially also EPSA, as a non-governmental organization that represent the interests of the pharmaceutical students, managed to have a permanent office in [[Brussels]] and daily lobby to promote its interests at the EU Institutions in order that they will take EPSA opinion into account when they legislate.
EPSA maintains several meetings with officials of European Commission, especially from DG SANCO (Directorate General for Health and Consumer Affairs) and DG ENTR (Directorate General Enterprise and Industry) and deputies of the European Parliament (especially from ENVI Committee) promoting EPSA opinion on Pharmacovigilance and Pharmaceutical Care.
Being in [[Brussels]] also allows EPSA to have the possibility to meet other students associations that are based as EPSA in the "Capital of Europe".

==Partners==

The [[International Pharmaceutical Students' Federation]] (IPSF) is the largest body representing pharmacy and pharmaceutical students and recent graduates in the world. EPSA collaborates with IPSF under a formal Memorandum of Understanding. The organisations work together yearly and have a similar membership base within Europe. EPSA and IPSF frequently share publications, initiatives, promote both associations, and work on behalf of European members to organize joint programming at their events.

[[Image:GlassPerscriptionRig.jpg|thumb|right|Using a [[phoropter]] to determine a prescription for eyeglasses]]

An '''eyeglass prescription''' is an order written by an eyewear prescriber, such as an [[optometrist]] or [[ophthalmologist]], that specifies the value of all parameters the prescriber has deemed necessary to construct and/or dispense corrective lenses appropriate for a patient.  If an [[Eye examination|examination]] indicates that corrective lenses are appropriate, the prescriber generally provides the patient with an eyewear prescription at the conclusion of the exam.

The parameters specified on spectacle prescriptions vary, but typically include the patient's name, power of the lenses, any prism to be included, the [[pupillary distance]], expiration date, and the prescriber's signature. The prescription is typically determined during a [[Eye examination#Refraction|refraction]], using a [[phoropter]] and asking the patient which of two lenses is better, or by [[Autorefractor|automated refractor]], or through the technique of [[retinoscopy]]. A [[dispensing optician]] will take a prescription written by an [[optometrist]] or [[ophthalmologist]] and order and/or assemble the frames and lenses to then be dispensed and sold to the patient.
{{TOC limit|3}}
==Components of a sphero-cylindrical correction==

===Sphere component===
Every corrective lens prescription includes a spherical correction in [[diopter]]s. Convergent powers are positive (e.g., +4.00 D) and condense light to correct for farsightedness ([[hyperopia]]) or allow the patient to read more comfortably (see [[presbyopia]] and [[binocular vision#Disorders|binocular vision disorders]]). Divergent powers are negative (e.g., −3.75 D) and spread out light to correct for nearsightedness ([[myopia]]). If neither convergence nor divergence is required in the prescription, "plano" is used to denote a refractive power of zero.

The term "sphere" comes from the geometry of lenses.  Lenses derive their power from curved surfaces.  A spherical lens has the same curvature in every direction perpendicular to the [[optical axis]]. Spherical lenses are adequate correction when a person has no [[astigmatism]].  To correct for astigmatism, the "cylinder" and "axis" components specify how a particular lens is different from a lens composed of purely spherical surfaces.

===Cylinder component===
Patients with [[astigmatism]] need a [[cylindrical lens]], or more generally a [[toric lens]] to see clearly. The geometry of a toric lens focuses light differently in different meridians. A meridian, in this case, is a plane that is perpendicular to the optical axis.  For example, a toric lens, when rotated correctly, could focus an object to the image of a horizontal line at one focal distance while focusing a vertical line to a separate focal distance.

The power of a toric lens can be specified by describing how the cylinder (the meridian that is most different from the spherical power) differs from the spherical power. Power evenly transitions between the two powers as you move from the meridian with the most convergence to the meridian with the least convergence. For regular toric lenses, these powers are perpendicular to each other and their location relative to vertical and horizontal are specified by the axis component.

There are two different conventions for indicating the amount of cylinder: "plus cylinder notation" and "minus cylinder notation". In the former, the cylinder power is a number of diopters more convergent than the sphere power. That means the spherical power describes the most divergent meridian and the cylindrical component describes the most convergent. In the minus cylinder notation, the cylinder power is a number of diopters more divergent than the sphere component. In this convention, the sphere power describes the most convergent meridian and the cylinder component describes the most divergent. Europe typically follows the plus cylinder convention while in the US the minus cylinder notation is used by optometrists and the plus cylinder notation is used by ophthalmologists. Minus cylinder notation is also more common in Asia, although either style may be encountered there. There is no difference in these forms of notation and it is easy to convert between them&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/NHS_Optical_Benefits_in_the_UK#Transposing_the_Format|title=NHS Optical Benefits in the UK - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|website=en.wikibooks.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 
* Add the sphere and cylinder numbers together to produce the converted sphere
* Invert the sign of cylinder value
* Add 90° to axis value, and if the new axis value exceeds 180°, subtract 180° from the result
For example, a lens with a vertical power of -3.75 and a horizontal power of -2.25 could be specified as either -2.25 -1.50 x 180 or -3.75 +1.50 x 090.

===Axis component===
[[File:Geraet beim Optiker.jpg|thumb|right|This [[phoropter]] is set to an axis of 180 for each eye. This can be seen by noticing the tiny white arrows that are horizontal as they point to the tiny numbers that line the opening the patient looks through. Click the image to see a full resolution version where the individual axis markings become more visible.]]The axis defines the location of the sphere and cylinder powers. The name "axis" comes from the concept of generating a cylinder by rotating a line around an axis. The curve of that cylinder is 90° from that axis of rotation. When dealing with toric lenses, the axis defines the orientation of the steepest and flattest curvatures relative to horizontal and vertical. The "3 o'clock" position is defined as zero, and the 90th meridian is a vertical line. A horizontal line passes through both zero and the 180th meridians. By convention, a horizontal axis is recorded as 180.

In a regular toric lens, the flattest and steepest curvatures are separated by 90°. As a result, the axis of the cylinder is also the meridian with the same power as the recorded sphere power. The cylinder power, as defined above is the power that is most different from the sphere power. Because they are defined relative to each other, it is important to know if the lens is being described in minus cylinder notation, where the sphere power is the most convergent / least divergent power. When using plus cylinder notation, the opposite is true.

If the lens is spherical (there is no cylinder component) then there is no need for an axis. A prescription like this is written with D.S. (diopters sphere) after the sphere power (e.g., −3.00 D.S.).  This verifies that the prescription is truly spherical rather than the cylinder power being omitted in error. 

====Summary====
* correction power is measured in diopters
* by convention, an axis of 90° is vertical, 0° or 180° are horizontal
* if the cylinder power is positive, the lens is most convergent 90° from the axis
* if the cylinder power is negative, the lens is most divergent 90° from the axis
* if the cylinder power is zero, the lens is spherical and has the same power in every meridian

=====Sample prescription=====
A prescription of ''−1.00 +0.25 x 180'' describes a lens that has a horizontal power of −1.00 D and a vertical power of −0.75 D.

==Abbreviations and terms==
[[Image:Specrx-prescription2.jpg|right]]

Similar to [[medical prescription]]s, eyeglass prescriptions are written on paper pads or included in a patient's [[electronic health record]], and contain a number of different abbreviations and terms:
*''DV'' is an abbreviation for ''distance vision''. This specifies the part of the prescription designed primarily to improve far vision. In a bifocal lens, this generally indicates what is to be placed in the top segment.
*''NV'' is an abbreviation for ''near vision''. This may represent a [[Corrective lens#Single vision|single-vision]] lens prescription to improve near work, or the reading portion of a bifocal lens. 
*''OD'' is an abbreviation for ''oculus dexter'', [[Latin]] for ''right eye'' from the patient's point of view. ''Oculus'' means ''eye''.
*''OS'' is an abbreviation for ''oculus sinister'', Latin for ''left eye'' from the patient's point of view.
*''OU'' is an abbreviation for ''oculi uterque'', Latin for ''both eyes''.
::N.B.: In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, ''RE'' (right eye), ''LE'' (left eye), and ''BE'' (both eyes) are used. Sometimes, just ''right'' and ''left'' are used.
*''SPH'', ''CYL'', and ''AXIS'' are values for describing the power of the lens using plus cylinder or minus cylinder notation.
*''ADD'' is an abbreviation for ''Near Addition''. This is the additional refractive power to be combined, or added, to the distance power to achieve the ideal near power.
*''Prism'' and ''Base'' Prism refers to a displacement of the image through the lens, often used to treat [[strabismus]] and other binocular vision disorders.  The [[Prism correction|prism]] value is measured in [[prism diopter]]s, and ''Base'' refers to the direction of displacement.
*''PD'' or ''IPD'' Pupillary Distance or Interpupillary Distance, respectively. It is the distance between pupil centers.
*''BVD'' Back [[vertex distance]] is the distance between the back of the spectacle lens and the front of the [[cornea]] (the front surface of the eye). This is significant in higher prescriptions (usually beyond ±4.00D) as slight changes in the vertex distance for in this range can cause a power to be delivered to the eye other than what was prescribed.

A '''galactocele''' (also: ''lacteal cyst'' or ''milk cyst'') is a [[retention cyst]] containing [[milk]] or a milky substance that is usually located in the [[mammary gland]]s. They occur in women during or shortly after lactation.

They present as a firm mass, often subareolar, and are caused by the obstruction of a lactiferous duct. Clinically, they appear similar to a cyst on examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Cases in Medicine and Surgery|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duct becomes more distended over time by epithelial cells and milk. It may rarely be complicated by a secondary infection and result in abscess formation. These cysts may rupture leading to formation of inflammatory reaction and may mimic Malignancy.

Once lactation has ended the cyst should resolve on its own without intervention. A galactocele is not normally infected as the milk within is sterile and has no outlet through which to become contaminated.Treatment is by aspiration of the contents or by excision of the cyst. Antibiotics are given to prevent infection.&lt;ref&gt;Bhat Sriram, SRB's Manual of Surgery, 2010, New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt;

Galactocele may be associated with oral contraceptive use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/EXAM/MULTORG/brstfrm.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121220150/http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/EXAM/MULTORG/brstfrm.html |archivedate=2011-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26094">'''Gestational age''' is a measure of the age of a [[pregnancy]] which is taken from the woman's [[Menstruation#Onset and frequency|last menstrual period]] (LMP), or the corresponding age of the gestation as estimated by a more accurate method if available. Such methods include adding 14 days to a known duration since [[Human fertilization|fertilization]] (as is possible in [[in vitro fertilization]]), or by [[obstetric ultrasonography]]. The popularity of using such a definition of gestational age is that menstrual periods are essentially always noticed, while there is usually a lack of a convenient way to discern when [[fertilization]] occurred.

The initiation of pregnancy for the calculation of gestational age can be different from definitions of [[Beginning of pregnancy controversy|initiation of pregnancy in context of the abortion debate]] or [[beginning of human personhood]].

==Methods==
According to [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], the main methods to calculate gestational age are:&lt;ref name=acog2012&gt;[http://www.acog.org/About_ACOG/ACOG_Departments/Patient_Safety_and_Quality_Improvement/~/media/Departments/Patient%20Safety%20and%20Quality%20Improvement/201213IssuesandRationale-GestationalAgeTerm.pdf Obstetric Data Definitions Issues and Rationale for Change - Gestational Age &amp; Term] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106111500/http://www.acog.org/About_ACOG/ACOG_Departments/Patient_Safety_and_Quality_Improvement/~/media/Departments/Patient%20Safety%20and%20Quality%20Improvement/201213IssuesandRationale-GestationalAgeTerm.pdf |date=2013-11-06 }} from Patient Safety and Quality Improvement at [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]]. Created November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Directly calculating the days since the beginning of the last menstrual period
*Early [[obstetric ultrasound]], comparing the size of an [[human embryo|embryo]] or [[fetus]] to that of a [[reference group]] of pregnancies of known gestational age (such as calculated from last menstrual periods), and using the mean gestational age of other embryos or fetuses of the same size. If the gestational age as calculated from an early ultrasound is contradictory to the one calculated directly from the last menstrual period, it is still the one from the early ultrasound that is used for the rest of the pregnancy.&lt;ref name=acog2012/&gt;
*In case of [[in vitro fertilization]], calculating days since [[oocyte retrieval]] or [[co-incubation]] and adding 14 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tunon | first1 = K. | last2 = Eik-Nes | first2 = S.

Gestational age can also be estimated by calculating days from [[ovulation]] if it was estimated from related signs or [[ovulation test]]s, and adding 14 days by convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = H. P. | last2 = Fleming | first2 = J. E.

As a general rule, the official gestational age should be based on the actual beginning of the last menstrual period, unless any of the above methods gives an estimated date that differs more than the variability for the method, in which case the difference cannot probably be explained by that variability alone.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010/&gt; For example, if there is a gestational age based on the beginning of the last menstrual period of 9.0 weeks, and a first-trimester obstetric ultrasonography gives an estimated gestational age of 10.0 weeks (with a 2 [[standard deviation|SD]] variability of ±8% of the estimate thereby giving a variability of ±0.8 weeks), the difference of 1.0 weeks between the tests is larger than the 2 SD variability of the ultrasonography estimate, indicating that the gestational age estimated by ultrasonography should be used as the official gestational age.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010/&gt;

Once the estimated due date (EDD) is established, it should rarely be changed, as the determination of gestational age is most accurate earlier in the pregnancy.&lt;ref name=pmid25244460&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000454932.15177.be |title=Committee Opinion No 611 |journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology |volume=124 |issue=4 |pages=863 |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to fertilization age==
The [[fertilization age]] (also called ''embryonic age'' and later ''fetal age'') is the time from the [[human fertilization|fertilization]]. It usually occurs within a day of [[ovulation]], which, in turn, occurs on average 14.6 days after the beginning of the preceding menstruation (LMP).&lt;ref name=Geirsson1991&gt;{{cite journal |author=Geirsson RT |title=Ultrasound instead of last menstrual period as the basis of gestational age assignment |journal=Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=212–9 |date=May 1991 |pmid=12797075 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-0705.1991.01030212.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also considerable variability in this interval, with a 95% [[prediction interval]] of the ovulation of 9 to 20 days after menstruation even for an average woman who has a mean LMP-to-ovulation time of 14.6.&lt;ref name=fehring2006&gt;Derived from a [[standard deviation]] in this interval of 2.6, as given in: {{cite journal |vauthors=Fehring RJ, Schneider M, Raviele K |title=Variability in the phases of the menstrual cycle |journal=J Obstet Gynecol Neonatal Nurs |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=376–84 |year=2006 |pmid=16700687 |doi=10.1111/j.1552-6909.2006.00051.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a reference group representing all women, the 95% prediction interval of the LMP-to-ovulation is 8.2 to 20.5 days.&lt;ref name=Geirsson1991/&gt; The actual variability between gestational age as estimated from the beginning of the last menstrual period (without the use of any additional method mentioned in previous section) is substantially larger because of uncertainty which menstrual cycle gave rise to the pregnancy. For example, the menstruation may be scarce enough to give the false appearance that an earlier menstruation gave rise to the pregnancy, potentially giving an estimated gestational age that is approximately one month too large. Also, vaginal bleeding occurs during 15-25% of first trimester [[Pregnancy|pregnancies]],&lt;ref name=Preg09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snell|first=BJ|title=Assessment and management of bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy.|journal=Journal of midwifery &amp; women's health|date=Nov–Dec 2009|volume=54|issue=6|pages=483–91|pmid=19879521|doi=10.1016/j.jmwh.2009.08.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be mistaken as menstruation, potentially giving an estimated gestational age that is too low.

==Uses==
Gestational age is used for example for:
*The events of [[prenatal development]], which usually occur at specific gestational ages. Hence, the gestational timing of a [[Environmental toxicants and fetal development|fetal toxin exposure]], [[Drugs in pregnancy|fetal drug exposure]] or [[vertically transmitted infection]] can be used to predict the potential consequences to the fetus.
*[[Estimated date of delivery]]
*Scheduling [[prenatal care]] 
*Estimation of [[fetal viability]]
*Calculating the results of various [[Prenatal diagnosis|prenatal tests]], (for example, in the [[triple test]]).
*Birth classification into for example preterm, term or postterm.
*Classification of infant deaths and stillbirths
*Postnatally (after birth) to estimate various risk factors

===Estimation of due date===
[[File:Distribution of gestational age at childbirth.jpg|thumb|280px|Distribution of gestational age at childbirth among singleton live births, given both when gestational age is estimated by first trimester ultrasound and directly by last menstrual period.&lt;ref name=hoffman2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=Caroline S.|last2=Messer|first2=Lynne C.|last3=Mendola|first3=Pauline|last4=Savitz|first4=David A.|last5=Herring|author5-link= Amy H.

{{Main|Estimated date of delivery}}

The mean pregnancy length has been estimated to be 283.4 days of gestational age as timed from the first day of the [[last menstrual period]] and 280.6 days when retrospectively estimated by [[obstetric ultrasound]] measurement of the [[fetal biparietal diameter]] (BPD) in the second trimester.&lt;ref name=pmid8590208&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1469-0705.1995.06050353.x |pmid=8590208 |title=The length of human pregnancy as calculated by ultrasonographic measurement of the fetal biparietal diameter |journal=Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=353 |year=1995 |last1=Kieler |first1=H |last2=Axelsson |first2=O |last3=Nilsson |first3=S |last4=Waldenströ |first4=U }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other algorithms take into account other variables, such as whether this is the first or subsequent child, the mother's race, age, length of menstrual cycle, and menstrual regularity.  In order to have a standard reference point, the normal pregnancy duration is assumed by medical professionals to be 280 days (or 40 weeks) of gestational age. Furthermore, actual childbirth has only a certain probability of occurring within the limits of the estimated due date. A study of singleton live births came to the result that childbirth has a [[standard deviation]] of 14 days when gestational age is estimated by first trimester [[obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasound]], and 16 days when estimated directly by last menstrual period.&lt;ref name=hoffman2008/&gt;

The most common system used among healthcare professionals is [[Naegele's rule]], which estimates the expected date of delivery (EDD) by adding a year, subtracting three months, and adding seven days to the first day of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP) or corresponding date as estimated from other means.

===Medical fetal viability===
There is no sharp limit of development, gestational age, or weight at which a human fetus automatically becomes viable.&lt;ref name=developinghuman&gt;Moore, Keith and Persaud, T.

Using the LMP (last menstrual period) method, a full-term human pregnancy is considered to be 40 weeks (280 days), though pregnancy lengths between 38 and 42 weeks are considered normal. A fetus born prior to the 37th week of gestation is considered to be ''preterm''.  A preterm baby is likely to be [[premature birth|premature]] and consequently faces increased risk of [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]]. An estimated due date is given by [[Naegele's rule]].

According to the WHO, a preterm birth is defined as "babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy are completed."&lt;ref name=WHOfs363&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs363/en/{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this classification, there are three sub-categories of preterm birth, based on gestational age: extremely preterm (less than 28 weeks), very preterm (28 to 32 weeks), moderate to late preterm (32 to 37 weeks).&lt;ref name=WHOfs363/&gt; Various jurisdictions may use different classifications.

===In classifying perinatal deaths, stillbirths  and infant deaths===
For most of the 20th Century, official definitions of a [[Live birth (human)|live birth]] and [[infant mortality|infant death]] in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Russia]] differed from common international standards, such as those established by the [[World Health Organization]] in the latter part of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1973432 |jstor=1973432 |title=Infant Mortality in the Soviet Union: Regional Differences and Measurement Issues |journal=Population and Development Review |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=705–38 |year=1986 |last1=Anderson |first1=Barbara A |last2=Silver |first2=Brian D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson, |first1=Barbara A. |first2=Brian D. |last2=Silver |title=The Geodemography of Infant Mortality in the Soviet Union, 1950-1990 |journal=PSC Research Report No. 94-316 |pages=8 |year=1994 |url=https://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/pubs/abs/958 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Babies who were less than 28 weeks of gestational age, or weighed less than 1000&amp;nbsp;grams, or less than 35&amp;nbsp;cm in length&amp;nbsp;– even if they showed some sign of life (breathing, heartbeat, voluntary muscle movement)&amp;nbsp;– were classified as "live fetuses" rather than "live births." Only if such newborns survived seven days (168 hours) were they then classified as live births. If, however, they died within that interval, they were classified as stillbirths.  If they survived that interval but died within the first 365 days they were classified as infant deaths.

More recently, thresholds for "[[fetal death]]" continue to vary widely internationally, sometimes incorporating weight as well as gestational age. The gestational age for statistical recording of fetal deaths ranges from 16 weeks in Norway, to 20 weeks in the US and Australia, 24 weeks in the UK, and 26 weeks in Italy and Spain.&lt;ref name=pmid23700489&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0064869 |pmid=23700489 |pmc=3658983 |title=International Comparisons of Fetal and Neonatal Mortality Rates in High-Income Countries: Should Exclusion Thresholds Be Based on Birth Weight or Gestational Age? |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=e64869 |year=2013 |last1=Mohangoo |first1=Ashna D |last2=Blondel |first2=Béatrice |last3=Gissler |first3=Mika |last4=Velebil |first4=Petr |last5=MacFarlane |first5=Alison |last6=Zeitlin |first6=Jennifer |bibcode=2013PLoSO...864869M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AIHW-2012&gt;{{cite web|last=Li|first=Z|title=Australia's Mothers and Babies 2010|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=60129542372|work=Perinatal statistics series no. 27.

The WHO defines the [[perinatal period]] as "The perinatal period commences at 22 completed weeks (154 days) of gestation and ends seven completed days after birth."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/topics/maternal/maternal_perinatal/en/{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perinatal mortality is the death of fetuses or neonates during the perinatal period. A 2013 study found that "While only a small proportion of births occur before 24 completed weeks of gestation (about 1 per 1000), survival is rare and most of them are either fetal deaths or live births followed by a neonatal death."&lt;ref name=pmid23700489/&gt;

===Postnatal use===
Gestational age (as well as ''fertilization age'') is sometimes used postnatally (after birth) to estimate various risk factors. For example, it is a better predictor than postnatal age for risk of [[intraventricular hemorrhage]] in [[Preterm birth|premature babies]] treated with [[extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2004.07.010 |title=Post-conceptional age and IVH in ECMO patients |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=145 |issue=2 |pages=A2 |year=2004 |last1=Jobe |first1=Alan H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors affecting it ==
Child's gestational age at birth (pregnancy length) is associated with various likely causal maternal non-genetic factors: stress during pregnancy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dole|first=N.|last2=Savitz|first2=D. A.|last3=Hertz-Picciotto|first3=I.|last4=Siega-Riz|first4=A. M.|last5=McMahon|first5=M.

Also, preexisting maternal medical conditions with genetic component, e.g., [[diabetes mellitus type 1]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[Anemia|anaemia]]. Parental ancestral background (race) also plays a role in pregnancy duration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1611">The healthcare system in Greenland is a publicly financed governmental responsibility managed by the Agency for Health and Prevention.  Greenland took over responsibility for the health care system from Denmark in 1992. 

There is a high infant mortality rate and high rates of death due to unnatural causes, especially suicides and accidents. 

==Healthcare==
In 2006, health care cost 938 million Danish kronor corresponding to 2,219 euros per head, almost entirely publicly financed. Health care is more than 18% of government expenditure.  About 28% is for  [[Queen Ingrid's Hospital]] and 12% of the budget for specialist treatments outside Greenland, including  serious criminal offenders in specialized psychiatric wards.   6% of the total budget goes on transport for patients with acute injuries or illnesses.  Each district has a small hospital and there are health clinics in every village.  Most  elective surgery is performed at [[Queen Ingrid's Hospital]].  It is difficult to recruit clinical staff especially for more remote areas.  

There are no private healthcare services, but there is private dental care, physiotherapy, psychotherapy and treatment for alcohol and drug abuse in [[Nuuk]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Niclasen |first1=Birgit |last2=Mulvad |first2=Gurt |title=Health care and health care delivery in Greenland |journal=International Journal of Circumpolar Health |date=2010 |volume=69 |issue=5 |pages=437-487 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3402/ijch.v69i5.17691 |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life expectancy ==
The 2015 CIA estimated average life expectancy in South Africa was 62.34 years.&lt;ref name=iuonoa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook Life Expectancy|publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The life expectancy for males is 60.83 years and for females 63.87 years.&lt;ref name=iuonoa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook Life Expectancy|publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== HIV/AIDS ==
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in South Africa}}

[[File:Map-of-HIV-Prevalance-in-Africa.png|thumb|300px|Estimated HIV infection in Africa in 2007 shows high rates of infection in Southern Africa.]]
[[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|HIV and AIDS in South Africa]] are major health concerns, and around 5.3&amp;nbsp;million people are thought to be living with the virus in South Africa.&lt;ref name="UNAids in South Africa"&gt;[http://www.unaids.org/en/Regions_Countries/Countries/south_africa.asp UNAIDS South Africa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016055733/http://www.unaids.org/en/Regions_Countries/Countries/south_africa.asp |date=October 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is the [[retrovirus]] that causes the disease known as AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). South Africa has more people with HIV/AIDS than any other country.&lt;ref name="radiodiaries"&gt;[http://www.radiodiaries.org/ radiodiaries] entry on "Just Another Day at the Biggest Hospital in the World"&lt;/ref&gt;

The South African National HIV Survey estimated that 10.8% of all South Africans over 2 years old were living with HIV in 2005. There is an average of almost 1,000 deaths of AIDS a day in South Africa.&lt;ref name="AVE2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/safricastats.htm |title=HIV and AIDS statistics for South Africa |publisher=Avert.org |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other infectious diseases==
Other infectious diseases prevalent in South Africa include [[Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli|bacterial diarrhea]], [[typhoid fever]], and [[hepatitis A]]. These infectious diseases are generally caused when the food or water consumed by an individual has been exposed to fecal material.&lt;ref&gt;"CIA - The World Factbook." Central Intelligence Agency, 4 Apr. 2007 {{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html | title=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  South Africa is an under developed nation and because of this the sanitation facility access in urban areas is 16% unimproved while in rural areas the sanitation facility access is 35% unimproved.&lt;ref&gt;"CIA - The World Factbook." Central Intelligence Agency, 4 Apr. 2007 {{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html#2193 | title=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaccination==
The [[South African Vaccination and Immunisation Centre]] began in 2003 as an alliance between the South African Department of Health, vaccine industry, academic institutions and other stakeholders. It works with WHO and the [[South African National Department of Health]] to educate, do research, provide technical support, and advocate. They work to increase rates of vaccination in order to improve the nation's health.&lt;ref name="SB"&gt;{{cite web |title=SAVIC -Background |url=http://www.savic.ac.za/about/background |publisher=South African Vaccination and Immunization Center |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malnutrition ==
{{Main|Malnutrition in South Africa}}{{See|Breastfeeding by HIV infected mothers}}

15% of South African infants are born with a low birth weight.&lt;ref name="Nutrition at a Glance: South Africa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrition at a Glance: South Africa|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/NUTRITION/Resources/281846-1271963823772/southafrica.pdf|publisher=The World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;  5% of South African children are so underweight they are considered to be wasted.&lt;ref name="Nutrition at a Glance: South Africa" /&gt; Since the 1990s South Africa's malnutrition problem has remained fairly stable.&lt;ref name="Nutrition at a Glance: South Africa" /&gt; But as malnutrition in terms of hunger is getting better, the number of obesity is rising and this is becoming a problem.

The prevalence of malnutrition in South Africa varies across different geographical areas and socio-economic groups.&lt;ref name="Nutrition at a Glance: South Africa" /&gt; Many infants in Africa suffer from malnutrition because their mothers do not breastfeed them. The reason mothers in South Africa avoid breastfeeding is to prevent passing on [[AIDS]] to their children.&lt;ref name="Breastfeeding by HIV-1-infected women and outcome in their infants: a cohort study from Durban, South Africa "&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bobat|first=Raziya|author2=Moodley, Dhayendree |author3=Coutsoudis, Anna |author4= Coovadia, Hoosen |title=Breastfeeding by HIV-1-infected women and outcome in their infants: a cohort study from Durban, South Africa|journal=AIDS|date=11 November 1997|volume=11|issue=13|pages=1627–1633|url=http://journals.lww.com/aidsonline/Fulltext/1997/13000/Breastfeeding_by_HIV_1_infected_women_and_outcome.12.aspx|doi=10.1097/00002030-199713000-00012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 [[Department of Health (South Africa)|South Africa Department of Health]] Study found that 30.2% of pregnant women in South Africa have AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Africa HIV &amp; AIDS Statistics|url=http://www.avert.org/south-africa-hiv-aids-statistics.htm|publisher=Avert: International HIV &amp; AIDS Charity|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, mothers give milk substitutes to their children and do so in unclean environments. Sometimes they go directly to giving food which are not adapted to infants. These things cause many cases of malnutrition in children under five years of age.

== Undernourishment ==
South Africa has less than 5% of the population facing undernourishment. In 2015 South Africa achieved one of the targets of the millennium development goal 1 which was to halve the number of people facing undernourishment between 1990 and 2015.

== Mental health ==
{{See|Mental health care in South Africa}}

In a study conducted by the Mental Health and Poverty research Program, it was found that approximately 16.5% of the adult population in South Africa suffers from mental illness, with 1% suffering from a severe life debilitating mental disease.&lt;ref name="Inge141"&gt;Inge, P., Arvin, B., Victoria, C., Sithembile, M., Crick, L., Sharon, K., &amp; ... the Mental Health and Poverty Research Programme, C. (2009). Planning for district mental health services in South Africa: a situational analysis of a rural district site. Health Policy &amp; Planning, 24(2), 140. Retrieved from EBSCOhost. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Okasha"&gt;Okasha, A. (2002). Mental health in Africa: the role of the WPA. World Psychiatry 1(1), 32–35. Web. Retrieved from PubMed.&lt;/ref&gt; 30% of South Africans are likely to suffer a mental illness in their lifetimes, depression being the most common ailment.&lt;ref name=MGMH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2015-07-01-sa-is-stressed-out-and-suicidal |title=SA is stressed out and suicidal |last=Green |first=Amy |date=1 July 2015 |accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these statistics may be an underestimation. Among the native population, many still hold to the traditional belief that mental illness results from a [[demonic possession]]. As a result, many individuals for fear of [[social ostracism]], keep their mental illness secret instead of seeking the much needed medical attention.&lt;ref name="Okasha" /&gt; This means that there is still a significant population suffering from mental illness that is currently unrepresented in mental health statistics. 

Bloomberg has ranked South Africa as the second "most stressed out" country in the world, due in large part to South Africans' work ethic. 53% of the South African work force does not take annual leave.&lt;ref name=MGMH/&gt;

Another large contributor to the high frequency of mental disorders is violence. Of the adult population ages 16 to 64, it was found that 23% were exposed to a [[traumatic event (psychological)|traumatic event]] of violence in the past year. These traumatic events include acts such as fighting a war, being [[torture]]d, or participating in violence. Among this population, it was determined that mental illness including symptoms of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) was 8.5 times more prevalent than among the general population.&lt;ref name="Hirschowitz169"&gt;Hirschowitz, R., &amp; Orkin, M. (1997). Trauma and mental health in South Africa. Social Indicators Research, 41(1–3), 169. Retrieved from EBSCOhost. p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor contributing to mental illness in South Africa is substance abuse. Many provinces are used as drug trafficking routes, and as the South African government lacks the necessary resources to control this problem, many of these illicit drugs find their way into local populations as a [[cannabis (drug)|drug]].&lt;ref name="Okasha" /&gt; In addition, the availability of the wild growing ''[[Cannabis]]'' plant allows for its rampant abuse among all age categories. It was found that 52% of street children smoke the Cannabis plant and 22% on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="Kilonzo422"&gt;Kilonzo, G. P., &amp; Simmons, N. N. (1998). Development of Mental Health Services in Tanzania: A Reappraisal for the Future. Social Science &amp; Medicine, 47(4), 419. Retrieved from EBSCOhost. p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; Educational campaigns are limited, and as a result, many do not realise the impinging health effects that will result from substance abuse. 

Diseases such as [[malaria]], typhoid fever, and HIV provide a significant contribution to the prevalence of mental illness. Some of these diseases such as [[cerebral malaria]] can bear a direct physiological effect on the mental functionality of the patient. However, even more poignant is the ability of disease to strike a radiating blow to the patient's emotional [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]]. For instance, the prevalence of mental illness among those suffering from HIV is 43.7% compared to the 16.5% observed among the general population.&lt;ref name="Freeman489"&gt;Freeman, M., Nkomo, N., Kafaar, Z., &amp; Kelly, K., 2008. Mental disorder in people living with HIV/AIDS in South Africa. South African Journal of Psychology, 38, pp.489–500.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maternal and child healthcare ==
The 2010 [[maternal mortality]] rate per 100,000 births for South Africa is 410.  This is compared with 236.8 in 2008 and 120.7 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 65 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 30. In South Africa the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is unavailable and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 100.&lt;ref name="SOWMY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html|title=The State Of The World's Midwifery|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Acute infection with {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} virus is associated with acute viral [[hepatitis]], an illness that begins with general ill-health, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, body aches, mild fever, and dark urine, and then progresses to development of [[jaundice]]. It has been noted that [[pruritus|itchy skin]] has been an indication as a possible symptom of all hepatitis virus types. The illness lasts for a few weeks and then gradually improves in most affected people. A few people may have a more severe form of liver disease known as [[fulminant hepatic failure]] and may die as a result. The infection may be entirely asymptomatic and may go unrecognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Terrault N, Roche B, Samuel D | title = Management of the hepatitis B virus in the liver transplantation setting: a European and an American perspective | journal = Liver Transplant. | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = 716–32 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15973718 | doi = 10.1002/lt.20492 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronic infection with {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} virus either may be asymptomatic or may be associated with a chronic inflammation of the liver (chronic hepatitis), leading to [[cirrhosis]] over a period of several years. This type of infection dramatically increases the incidence of [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] (HCC; liver cancer). Across Europe, hepatitis B and C cause approximately 50% of hepatocellular carcinomas.&lt;ref name="pmid17570226"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = El-Serag HB, Rudolph KL | title = Hepatocellular carcinoma: epidemiology and molecular carcinogenesis | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 132 | issue = 7 | pages = 2557–76 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17570226 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2007.04.061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21992124"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = El-Serag HB | title = Hepatocellular carcinoma | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 365 | issue = 12 | pages = 1118–27 | date = 22 September 2011 | pmid = 21992124 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1001683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic carriers are encouraged to avoid consuming [[alcohol]] as it increases their risk for [[cirrhosis]] and liver cancer. {{nowrap|Hepatitis B}} virus has been linked to the development of [[membranous glomerulonephritis]] (MGN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gan SI, Devlin SM, Scott-Douglas NW, Burak KW | title = Lamivudine for the treatment of membranous glomerulopathy secondary to chronic hepatitis B infection | journal = Canadian journal of gastroenterology = Journal canadien de gastroenterologie | volume = 19 | issue = 10 | pages = 625–9 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16247526 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nowrap|Hepatitis B}} virus (HBV) is a member of the [[Hepadnaviridae|hepadnavirus family]].&lt;ref name=Baron&gt;{{Cite book |author=Zuckerman AJ |chapter=Hepatitis Viruses |title=Baron's Medical Microbiology |editor=Baron S |edition=4th |publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch |year=1996 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.3738 |isbn=0-9631172-1-1 |display-editors=etal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714042359/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.3738 |archivedate=14 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The virus particle ([[virion]]) consists of an outer [[lipid]] envelope and an [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] [[nucleocapsid]] core composed of [[protein]]. These virions are 30–42&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter. The nucleocapsid encloses the viral DNA and a DNA polymerase that has [[reverse transcriptase]] activity.&lt;ref name="pmid15192795"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Locarnini S | title = Molecular Virology of Hepatitis B Virus | journal = Seminars in Liver Disease | volume = 24 | pages = 3–10 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15192795 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1055/s-2004-828672 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The outer envelope contains embedded proteins that are involved in viral binding of, and entry into, susceptible cells. The virus is one of the smallest enveloped animal viruses.  The 42&amp;nbsp;nm virions, which are capable of infecting liver cells known as [[hepatocyte]]s, are referred to as "Dane particles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harrison T |title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=2009 |page=455 |isbn=0-12-375146-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Dane particles, filamentous and spherical bodies lacking a core can be found in the serum of infected individuals.   These particles are not infectious and are composed of the lipid and protein that forms part of the surface of the virion, which is called the surface antigens ([[HBsAg]]), and is produced in excess during the life cycle of the virus.&lt;ref name="pmid3014045"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Howard CR | title = The Biology of Hepadnaviruses | journal = Journal of General Virology | volume = 67 | issue = 7 | pages = 1215–1235 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3014045 | doi = 10.1099/0022-1317-67-7-1215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genome====
[[File:HBV Genome.svg|left|thumb|The genome organisation of HBV. The genes overlap.]]
The [[genome]] of HBV is made of circular [[DNA]], but it is unusual because the DNA is not fully [[Double helix|double-stranded]]. One end of the full length strand is linked to the viral [[DNA polymerase]]. The genome is 3020–3320 [[nucleotides]] long (for the full-length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kay A, Zoulim F | title = Hepatitis B virus genetic variability and evolution | journal = Virus research | volume = 127 | issue = 2 | pages = 164–176 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17383765 | doi = 10.1016/j.virusres.2007.02.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]. The viral DNA is found in the [[Nucleus (biology)|nucleus]] soon after infection of the [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a [[protein]] [[molecule]] from the (−) sense strand and a short sequence of [[RNA]] from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) sense strand and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start [[codon]] is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by [[Proteolysis|proteolytic]] processing of the pre-core protein. In some rare strains of the virus known as [[Hepatitis B virus precore mutant]]s, no HBeAg is present.&lt;ref name="pmid16461229"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buti M, Rodriguez-Frias F, Jardi R, Esteban R |title=Hepatitis B virus genome variability and disease progression: the impact of pre-core mutants and HBV genotypes |journal=Journal of Clinical Virology |volume=34 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=S79–82 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16461229 |doi= 10.1016/s1386-6532(05)80015-0|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pathogenesis====
[[File:HBV replication.png|thumb|Hepatitis B virus replication]]
The life cycle of {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} virus is complex. {{nowrap|Hepatitis B}} is one of a few known [[pararetrovirus]]es: non-[[retrovirus]]es that still use [[reverse transcription]] in their replication process. The virus gains entry into the cell by binding to [[SLC10A1|NTCP]] &lt;ref name="pmid23150796"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yan H, Zhong G, Xu G, He W, Jing Z, Gao Z, Huang Y, Qi Y, Peng B, Wang H, Fu L, Song M, Chen P, Gao W, Ren B, Sun Y, Cai T, Feng X, Sui J, Li W | title = Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide is a functional receptor for human hepatitis B and D virus | journal = eLife | volume = 1 | pages = e00049 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23150796 | pmc = 3485615 | doi = 10.7554/eLife.00049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the surface and being [[endocytosis|endocytosed]]. Because the virus multiplies via RNA made by a host enzyme, the viral genomic DNA has to be transferred to the cell nucleus by host proteins called chaperones. The partially double-stranded viral DNA is then made fully double stranded by a viral polymerase and transformed into covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). This cccDNA serves as a template for transcription of four viral [[mRNA]]s by host RNA polymerase. The largest mRNA, (which is longer than the viral genome), is used to make the new copies of the genome and to make the [[capsid]] core protein and the viral [[DNA polymerase]]. These four viral transcripts undergo additional processing and go on to form progeny virions that are released from the cell or returned to the nucleus and re-cycled to produce even more copies.&lt;ref name="pmid17206754" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17206755"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bruss V | title = Hepatitis B virus morphogenesis | journal = World J. Gastroenterol. | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–73 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17206755 | pmc = 4065877 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The long mRNA is then transported back to the cytoplasm where the virion P protein (the DNA polymerase) synthesizes DNA via its reverse transcriptase activity.

====Serotypes and genotypes====
The virus is divided into four major [[serotype]]s (adr, adw, ayr, ayw) based on antigenic [[epitope]]s presented on its envelope proteins, and into eight major genotypes (A–H). The genotypes have a distinct geographical distribution and are used in tracing the evolution and transmission of the virus. Differences between genotypes affect the disease severity, course and likelihood of complications, and response to treatment and possibly vaccination.&lt;ref name="pmid15752827"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kramvis A, Kew M, François G | title = Hepatitis B virus genotypes | journal = Vaccine | volume = 23 | issue = 19 | pages = 2409–23 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15752827 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2004.10.045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8666521"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Magnius LO, Norder H | title = Subtypes, genotypes and molecular epidemiology of the hepatitis B virus as reflected by sequence variability of the S-gene | journal = Intervirology | volume = 38 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 24–34 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8666521 | doi = 10.1159/000150411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two other genotypes I and J but they are not universally accepted as of 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Araujo|first1=NM|title=Hepatitis B virus intergenotypic recombinants worldwide: An overview.|journal=Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases|date=December 2015|volume=36|pages=500–10|pmid=26299884|doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2015.08.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==

{{nowrap|Hepatitis B}} virus primarily interferes with the functions of the liver by replicating in [[hepatocytes]]. A functional [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] is [[SLC10A1|NTCP]].&lt;ref name="pmid23150796"/&gt; There is evidence that the receptor in the closely related [[duck hepatitis B virus]] is [[carboxypeptidase D]].&lt;ref name="pmid10482623"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tong S, Li J, Wands JR | title = Carboxypeptidase D is an avian hepatitis B virus receptor | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 73 | issue = 10 | pages = 8696–8702 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10482623 | pmc = 112890 | doi =  | url = http://jvi.asm.org/content/73/10/8696.full.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160123070551/http://jvi.asm.org/content/73/10/8696.full.pdf | archivedate = 23 January 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17206752"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glebe D, Urban S | title = Viral and cellular determinants involved in hepadnaviral entry | journal = World J.

HBV-preS-specific receptors are expressed primarily on hepatocytes; however, viral DNA and proteins have also been detected in extrahepatic sites, suggesting that cellular receptors for HBV may also exist on extrahepatic cells.&lt;ref name="pmid21462295"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coffin CS, Mulrooney-Cousins PM, van Marle G, Roberts JP, Michalak TI, Terrault NA | title = Hepatitis B virus (HBV) quasispecies in hepatic and extrahepatic viral reservoirs in liver transplant recipients on prophylactic therapy | journal = Liver Transpl | volume = 17 | issue = 8 | pages = 955–62 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21462295 | doi = 10.1002/lt.22312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During HBV infection, the host [[immune response]] causes both hepatocellular damage and viral clearance. Although the innate immune response does not play a significant role in these processes, the adaptive immune response, in particular virus-specific [[cytotoxic T lymphocytes]](CTLs), contributes to most of the liver injury associated with HBV infection. CTLs eliminate HBV infection by killing infected cells and producing antiviral [[cytokine]]s, which are then used to purge HBV from viable hepatocytes.&lt;ref name="Iannacone 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iannacone M, Sitia G, Ruggeri ZM, Guidotti LG | title = HBV pathogenesis in animal models: Recent advances on the role of platelets | journal = Journal of Hepatology | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 719–726 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17316876 | pmc = 1892635 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhep.2007.01.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although liver damage is initiated and mediated by the CTLs, [[antigen]]-nonspecific [[inflammatory cell]]s can worsen CTL-induced immunopathology, and [[platelets]] activated at the site of infection may facilitate the accumulation of CTLs in the liver.&lt;ref name=Iannacone_2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iannacone M, Sitia G, Isogawa M, Marchese P, Castro MG, Lowenstein PR, Chisari FV, Ruggeri ZM, Guidotti LG | title = Platelets mediate cytotoxic T lymphocyte-induced liver damage | journal = Nat.

==Diagnosis==
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=HBV serum markers.png|image2=Chronic HBV Diagram-Vector.svg|caption1=Hepatitis B viral antigens and antibodies detectable in the blood following acute infection|caption2=Hepatitis B viral antigens and antibodies detectable in the blood of a chronically infected person}}
The tests, called [[assay]]s, for detection of {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} virus infection involve [[Serum (blood)|serum]] or [[blood test]]s that detect either viral antigens (proteins produced by the virus) or [[antibody|antibodies]] produced by the host. Interpretation of these assays is complex.&lt;ref name="pmid3331068"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bonino F, Chiaberge E, Maran E, Piantino P | title = Serological markers of HBV infectivity | journal = Ann. Ist. Super. Sanita | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 217–23 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3331068 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} surface antigen ([[HBsAg]]) is most frequently used to screen for the presence of this infection. It is the first detectable viral antigen to appear during infection. However, early in an infection, this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host. The infectious virion contains an inner "core particle" enclosing viral genome. The icosahedral core particle is made of 180 or 240 copies of the core protein, alternatively known as {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} core antigen, or [[HBcAg]]. During this 'window' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus, [[IgM]] antibodies specific to the {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} core antigen (''anti-HBc IgM'') may be the only serological evidence of disease.  Therefore, most {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} diagnostic panels contain HBsAg and total anti-HBc (both IgM and IgG).&lt;ref name="isbn0-12-375147-0"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Karayiannis P, Thomas HC |editor1= Mahy BWJ |editor2=van Regenmortel MHV|title=Desk Encyclopedia of Human and Medical Virology |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=2009 |page=110 |isbn=0-12-375147-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the appearance of the HBsAg, another antigen called {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} e antigen ([[HBeAg]]) will appear. Traditionally, the presence of HBeAg in a host's serum is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and enhanced infectivity; however, variants of the {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} virus do not produce the 'e' antigen, so this rule does not always hold true.&lt;ref name=Liaw2010&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink1=Yun-Fan Liaw | vauthors = Liaw YF, Brunetto MR, Hadziyannis S | title = The natural history of chronic HBV infection and geographical differences | journal = Antiviral Therapy | volume = 15 | pages = 25–33 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21041901 | pmc =  | doi = 10.3851/IMP1621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the natural course of an infection, the HBeAg may be cleared, and antibodies to the 'e' antigen (''anti-HBe'') will arise immediately afterwards. This conversion is usually associated with a dramatic decline in viral replication.

If the host is able to clear the infection, eventually the HBsAg will become undetectable and will be followed by [[IgG]] antibodies to the {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} surface antigen and core antigen (''anti-HBs'' and ''anti HBc IgG'').&lt;ref name=Baron /&gt; The time between the removal of the HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs is called the [[window period]]. A person negative for HBsAg but positive for anti-HBs either has cleared an infection or has been vaccinated previously.

Individuals who remain HBsAg positive for at least six months are considered to be {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} carriers.&lt;ref name="pmid17256718"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lok AS, McMahon BJ | title = Chronic hepatitis B | journal = Hepatology | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | pages = 507–39 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17256718 | doi = 10.1002/hep.21513 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carriers of the virus may have chronic hepatitis B, which would be reflected by elevated serum [[alanine aminotransferase]] (ALT) levels and inflammation of the liver, if they are in the immune clearance phase of chronic infection. Carriers who have seroconverted to HBeAg negative status, in particular those who acquired the infection as adults, have very little viral multiplication and hence may be at little risk of long-term complications or of transmitting infection to others.&lt;ref name="pmid17935720"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chu CM, Liaw YF | title = Predictive factors for reactivation of hepatitis B following hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion in chronic hepatitis B | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 133 | issue = 5 | pages = 1458–65 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17935720 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2007.08.039 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible for individuals to enter an "immune escape" with HBeAg-negative hepatitis.

==Prevention==
===Vaccine===
{{Main|Hepatitis B vaccine}}
Vaccines for the prevention of hepatitis B have been routinely recommended for babies since 1991 in the United States.&lt;ref name=CDC2013/&gt; The first dose is generally recommended within a day of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Elimination of Perinatal Hepatitis B: Providing the First Vaccine Dose Within 24 Hours of Birth|journal=Pediatrics|date=28 August 2017|pages=e20171870|doi=10.1542/peds.2017-1870|volume=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most vaccines are given in three doses over a course of months. A protective response to the vaccine is defined as an anti-HBs antibody concentration of  at least 10&amp;nbsp;mIU/ml in the recipient's serum. The vaccine is more effective in children and 95 percent of those vaccinated have protective levels of antibody. This drops to around 90% at 40&amp;nbsp;years of age  and to around 75 percent in those over 60&amp;nbsp;years. The protection afforded by vaccination is long lasting even after antibody levels fall below 10&amp;nbsp;mIU/ml. For newborns of HBsAg-positive mothers: hepatitis B vaccine alone, hepatitis B immunoglobulin alone, or the combination of vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin, all prevent hepatitis B occurrence.&lt;ref name=Lee2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Chuanfang|last2=Gong|first2=Yan|last3=Brok|first3=Jesper|last4=Boxall|first4=Elizabeth H|last5=Gluud|first5=Christian|title=Hepatitis B immunisation for newborn infants of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=19 April 2006|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004790.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the combination of vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin is superior to vaccine alone.&lt;ref name=Lee2006 /&gt; This combination prevents HBV transmission around the time of birth in 86% to 99% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wong|first1=F|last2=Pai|first2=R|last3=Van Schalkwyk|first3=J|last4=Yoshida|first4=EM|title=Hepatitis B in pregnancy: a concise review of neonatal vertical transmission and antiviral prophylaxis.|journal=Annals of Hepatology|date=2014|volume=13|issue=2|pages=187–95|pmid=24552860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These include [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] medications [[lamivudine]], [[adefovir]], [[tenofovir disoproxil]], [[tenofovir alafenamide]], [[telbivudine]], and [[entecavir]], and the two [[immune system]] modulators [[Interferon|interferon alpha-2a]] and [[Peginterferon alfa-2a|PEGylated interferon alpha-2a]].

{{nowrap|Hepatitis B}} virus infection may be either acute (self-limiting) or chronic (long-standing). Persons with self-limiting infection clear the infection spontaneously within weeks to months.

Children are less likely than adults to clear the infection. More than 95% of people who become infected as adults or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus. However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bell SJ, Nguyen T | title = The management of hepatitis B | journal = Aust Prescr | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 99–104 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.18773/austprescr.2009.048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from [[cirrhosis]] or [[hepatocellular carcinoma]].&lt;ref name="Dienstag"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dienstag JL | title = Hepatitis B Virus Infection | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 359 | issue = 14 | pages = 1486–1500 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18832247 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra0801644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those infected between the age of one to six, 70% will clear the infection.&lt;ref name="pmid16176431"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerkar N | title = Hepatitis B in children: complexities in management | journal = Pediatric transplantation | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 685–691 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16176431 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3046.2005.00393.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
[[File:HBV prevalence 2005.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Prevalence of hepatitis B virus as of 2005]]
In 2004, an estimated 350&amp;nbsp;million individuals were infected worldwide. National and regional prevalences range from over 10% in Asia to under 0.5% in the United States and Northern Europe.

Routes of infection include vertical transmission (such as through childbirth), early life horizontal transmission (bites, lesions, and sanitary habits), and adult horizontal transmission (sexual contact, intravenous drug use).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Custer B, Sullivan SD, Hazlet TK, Iloeje U, Veenstra DL, Kowdley KV | title = Global epidemiology of hepatitis B virus | journal = Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology | volume = 38 | issue = 10 Suppl 3 | pages = S158–68 | date = Nov–Dec 2004 | pmid = 15602165 | doi = 10.1097/00004836-200411003-00008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary method of transmission reflects the prevalence of chronic HBV infection in a given area. In low prevalence areas such as the continental United States and Western Europe, injection drug abuse and unprotected sex are the primary methods, although other factors may also be important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Redd JT, Baumbach J, Kohn W, Nainan O, Khristova M, Williams I | title = Patient-to-patient transmission of hepatitis B virus associated with oral surgery | journal = J.

The earliest record of an epidemic caused by {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} virus was made by Lurman in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lurman A | title = Eine icterus epidemic | language = German | journal = Berl Klin Woschenschr | volume = 22 | pages = 20–3 | year = 1885 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An outbreak of [[smallpox]] occurred in [[Bremen]] in 1883 and 1,289 shipyard employees were [[vaccinated]] with [[lymph]] from other people. After several weeks, and up to eight months later, 191 of the vaccinated workers became ill with [[jaundice]] and were diagnosed as suffering from serum hepatitis. Other employees who had been inoculated with different batches of lymph remained healthy. Lurman's paper, now regarded as a classical example of an [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] study, proved that contaminated lymph was the source of the outbreak. Later, numerous similar outbreaks were reported following the introduction, in 1909, of [[hypodermic needles]] that were used, and, more importantly, reused, for administering [[Arsphenamine|Salvarsan]] for the treatment of [[syphilis]]. The virus was not discovered until 1966 when [[Baruch Blumberg]], then working at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), discovered the [[HBsAg|Australia antigen]] (later known to be {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} surface antigen, or HBsAg) in the blood of Australian aboriginal people.&lt;ref name="pmid5930797"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alter HJ, Blumberg BS | title = Further studies on a "new" human isoprecipitin system (Australia antigen) | journal = Blood | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 297–309 | date = March 1966 | pmid = 5930797 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a virus had been suspected since the research published by Frederick MacCallum in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacCallum FO | title = Homologous serum hepatitis | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue =  | pages =  691–692| year = 1947 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(47)90722-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Dane]] and others discovered the virus particle in 1970 by [[electron microscopy]].&lt;ref name="pmid4190997"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dane DS, Cameron CH, Briggs M | title = Virus-like particles in serum of patients with Australia-antigen-associated hepatitis | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 7649 | pages = 695–8 | date = April 1970 | pmid = 4190997 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(70)90926-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1980s the [[genome]] of the virus had been sequenced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Galibert F, Mandart E, Fitoussi F, Tiollais P, Charnay P | title = Nucleotide sequence of the hepatitis B virus genome (subtype ayw) cloned in E. coli | journal = Nature | volume = 281 | issue = 5733 | pages = 646–50 | date = October 1979 | pmid = 399327 | doi = 10.1038/281646a0 | bibcode = 1979Natur.281..646G }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first vaccines were being tested.&lt;ref name="pmid6108398"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Hepatitis B vaccine | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = 8206 | pages = 1229–1230 | date = December 1980 | pmid = 6108398 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(80)92484-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
[[World Hepatitis Day]], observed July 28, aims to raise global awareness of {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} and [[hepatitis C]] and encourage prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. It has been led by the World Hepatitis Alliance since 2007 and in May 2010, it received global endorsement from the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viral hepatitis|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/EB126/B126_R16-en.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811014812/http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/EB126/B126_R16-en.pdf|archivedate=11 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It causes a characteristic [[purpuric]] rash and an increased tendency to bleed. Two distinct clinical syndromes manifest as an acute condition in children and a chronic condition in adults. The acute form often follows an infection and has a spontaneous resolution within two months. Chronic immune thrombocytopenia persists longer than six months with a specific cause being unknown.

ITP is an [[autoimmune]] disease with [[antibodies]] detectable against several platelet surface [[antigens]].

ITP is diagnosed by a low platelet count in a [[complete blood count]] (a common [[blood test]]). However, since the diagnosis depends on the exclusion of other causes of a low platelet count, additional investigations (such as a [[bone marrow biopsy]]) may be necessary in some cases.

In mild cases, only careful observation may be required but very low counts or significant bleeding may prompt treatment with [[glucocorticoid|corticosteroids]], [[intravenous immunoglobulin]], [[Rho(D) immune globulin|anti-D immunoglobulin]], or immunosuppressive medications. ''Refractory ITP'' (not responsive to conventional treatment) may require [[splenectomy]], the surgical removal of the spleen. [[Plateletpheresis|Platelet transfusions]] may be used in severe bleeding together with a very low count. Sometimes the body may compensate by making abnormally large platelets.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs include the spontaneous formation of [[purpura|bruises]] (purpura) and [[petechia]]e (tiny bruises), especially on the [[limb (anatomy)|extremities]], [[epistaxis|bleeding from the nostrils]] and/or [[gums]], and [[menorrhagia]] (excessive [[menstruation|menstrual bleeding]]), any of which may occur if the platelet count is below 20,000 per μl.&lt;ref name="pmid15660520"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cines DB, McMillan R |title=Management of adult idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura |journal=Annu. Rev. Med. |volume=56 |pages=425–42 |year=2005 |pmid=15660520 |doi=10.1146/annurev.med.56.082103.104644}}&lt;/ref&gt; A very low count (&lt;10,000 per μl) may result in the spontaneous formation of [[hematoma]]s (blood masses) in the mouth or on other [[mucous membrane]]s. Bleeding time from minor [[laceration]]s or [[abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] is usually prolonged.

Serious and possibly [[complication (medicine)|fatal complications]] due to extremely low counts (&lt;5,000 per μl) include [[Subarachnoid hemorrhage|subarachnoid]] or [[intracerebral hemorrhage]] (bleeding inside the [[skull]] or [[brain]]), [[lower gastrointestinal bleeding]] or other internal bleeding. An ITP patient with an extremely low count is vulnerable to internal bleeding caused by [[abdominal trauma|blunt abdominal trauma]], as might be experienced in a [[motor vehicle collision|motor vehicle crash]]. These complications are not likely when the platelet count is above 20,000 per μl.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Pathogenesis==
In approximately 60 percent of cases, [[antibodies]] against platelets can be detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coopamah M, Garvey M, Freedman J, Semple J |title=Cellular immune mechanisms in autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura: An update |journal=Transfus Med Rev |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=69–80 |year=2003 |pmid=12522773 |doi=10.1053/tmrv.2003.50004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; Most often these antibodies are against platelet membrane [[glycoprotein]]s [[IIb-IIIa]] or [[Ib-IX]], and are of the [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG) type. The [[Harrington–Hollingsworth experiment]], established the immune [[pathogenesis]] of ITP.&lt;ref name="pmid18046034"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schwartz RS |title=Immune thrombocytopenic purpura—from agony to agonist |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=357 |issue=22 |pages=2299–301 |year=2007 |pmid=18046034 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe0707126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coating of platelets with IgG renders them susceptible to [[opsonization]] and [[phagocytosis]] by [[spleen|splenic]] [[macrophage]]s, as well by [[Kupffer cell]]s in the [[liver]].&amp;nbsp; The IgG autoantibodies are also thought to damage [[megakaryocyte]]s, the precursor cells to platelets, although this is believed to contribute only slightly to the decrease in platelet numbers.&amp;nbsp; Recent research now indicates that impaired production of the [[glycoprotein]] [[hormone]] [[thrombopoietin]], which is the stimulant for platelet production, may be a contributing factor to the reduction in circulating platelets.&amp;nbsp; This observation has led to the development of a class of ITP-targeted medications referred to as thrombopoietin [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[agonist]]s.

The stimulus for auto-antibody production in ITP is probably abnormal [[T cell]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Semple JW, Freedman J |title=Increased antiplatelet T helper lymphocyte reactivity in patients with autoimmune thrombocytopenia |journal=Blood |volume=78 |issue=10 |pages=2619–25 |year=1991 |pmid=1840468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18375792"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Stasi R, Cooper N, Del Poeta G, etal |title=Analysis of regulatory T-cell changes in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura receiving B cell-depleting therapy with rituximab |journal=Blood |volume=112 |issue=4 |pages=1147–50 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18375792 |doi=10.1182/blood-2007-12-129262 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18375792}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18420827"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Yu J, Heck S, Patel V, etal |title=Defective circulating CD25 regulatory T cells in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura |journal=Blood |volume=112 |issue=4 |pages=1325–8 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18420827 |doi=10.1182/blood-2008-01-135335 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18420827 |pmc=2515134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; Preliminary findings suggest that these T cells can be influenced by medications that target [[B cell]]s, such as [[rituximab]].&lt;ref name="pmid18463354"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Godeau B, Porcher R, Fain O, etal |title=Rituximab efficacy and safety in adult splenectomy candidates with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura: results of a prospective multicenter phase 2 study |journal=Blood |volume=112 |issue=4 |pages=999–1004 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18463354 |doi=10.1182/blood-2008-01-131029 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18463354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of ITP is a process of exclusion.&amp;nbsp; First, it has to be determined that there are no blood abnormalities other than a low platelet count, and no physical signs other than bleeding.&amp;nbsp; Then, secondary causes (5&amp;ndash;10 percent of suspected ITP cases) should be excluded.&amp;nbsp; Such secondary causes include [[leukemia]], medications (e.g., [[quinine]], [[heparin]]), [[lupus erythematosus]], [[cirrhosis]], [[HIV]], [[hepatitis]] C, congenital causes, [[antiphospholipid syndrome]], [[von Willebrand factor]] deficiency, [[onyalai]] and others.&lt;ref name="pmid15660520"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15941913"/&gt;&amp;nbsp; In approximately one percent of cases, [[autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] and ITP coexist, a condition referred to as [[Evans syndrome]], a condition that points to [[B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia|CLL]] as a possible cause.&lt;ref name="pmid15941913"/&gt;

Despite the destruction of platelets by splenic macrophages, the spleen is normally not enlarged.&amp;nbsp; In fact, an enlarged spleen should lead to a search for other possible causes for the thrombocytopenia.&amp;nbsp; Bleeding time is usually prolonged in ITP patients.&amp;nbsp; However, the use of bleeding time in diagnosis is discouraged by the American Society of Hematology practice guidelines&lt;ref name="pmid9036806"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: recommendations of the American Society of Hematology. The American Society of Hematology ITP Practice Guideline Panel |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=126 |issue=4 |pages=319–26 |year=1997 |pmid=9036806 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-126-4-199702150-00010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a normal bleeding time does not exclude a platelet disorder.&lt;ref name="pmid9081003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liesner RJ, Machin SJ |title=ABC of clinical haematology. Platelet disorders |journal=BMJ |volume=314 |issue=7083 |pages=809–12 |year=1997 |pmid=9081003 |pmc=2126215 |doi=10.1136/bmj.314.7083.809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bone marrow]] [[bone marrow examination|examination]] may be performed on patients over the age of 60 and those who do not respond to treatment, or when the diagnosis is in doubt.&lt;ref name="pmid15941913"/&gt;&amp;nbsp; On examination of the marrow, an increase in the production of megakaryocytes may be observed &lt;!--- there's still disagreement as to whether increased megakaryocyte production is a response to platelet destruction ---&gt; and may help in establishing a diagnosis of ITP.&amp;nbsp; An analysis for anti-platelet antibodies is a matter of clinician's preference, as there is disagreement on whether the 80 percent specificity of this test is sufficient to be clinically useful.&lt;ref name="pmid15941913"/&gt;

==Treatment==
With rare exceptions, there is usually no need to treat based on platelet counts. Many older recommendations suggested a certain platelet count threshold (usually somewhere below 20.0/µl) as an indication for hospitalization or treatment. Current guidelines recommend treatment only in cases of significant bleeding.
Treatment recommendations sometimes differ for adult and pediatric ITP.&lt;ref name="practice"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Neunert C, Lim W, Crowther M, Cohen A, Solberg L, Crowther MA |title=The American Society of Hematology 2011 evidence-based practice guideline for immune thrombocytopenia |journal=Blood |volume=117 |issue=16 |pages=4190–207 |date=April 2011 |pmid=21325604 |doi=10.1182/blood-2010-08-302984 |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/early/2011/03/16/blood-2010-08-302984.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steroids===
Initial treatment usually consists of the administration of [[glucocorticoid|corticosteroids]], a group of medications that suppress the immune system. The dose and mode of administration is determined by platelet count and whether there is active bleeding: in urgent situations, [[Routes of administration#Parenteral|infusions]] of [[dexamethasone]] or [[methylprednisolone]] may be used, while oral [[prednisone]] or [[prednisolone]] may suffice in less severe cases. Once the platelet count has improved, the dose of steroid is gradually reduced while the possibility of relapse is monitored. 60–90 percent will experience a relapse during dose reduction or cessation.&lt;ref name="pmid15941913"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17122451"/&gt; Long-term steroids are avoided if possible because of potential [[Corticosteroid#Side-effects|side-effects]] that include [[osteoporosis]], [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and [[cataract]]s.&lt;ref name="sideeffects"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchman|first1=AL|title=Side effects of corticosteroid therapy|journal=J Clin Gastroenterol|date=Oct 2001|volume=33|issue=4|pages=289–294|pmid=11588541|doi=10.1097/00004836-200110000-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-D===
Another option, suitable for [[Rhesus blood group system|Rh-positive]] patients with functional [[spleen]]s is intravenous administration of [[Rho(D) immune globulin]] [Human; Anti-D]. The mechanism of action of anti-D is not fully understood. However, following administration, anti-D-coated red blood cell complexes saturate [[Fc receptor|Fcγ receptor]] sites on [[macrophages]], resulting in preferential destruction of [[red blood cells]] (RBCs), therefore sparing antibody-coated [[platelets]]. There are two anti-D products indicated for use in patients with ITP: WinRho SDF and Rhophylac. The most common adverse reactions are headache (15%), nausea/vomiting (12%) chills (&lt;2%) and fever (1%).

===Steroid-sparing agents===
There is increasing use of [[immunosuppressant]]s such as [[mycophenolic acid|mycophenolate mofetil]] and [[azathioprine]] because of their effectiveness. In chronic refractory cases, where immune pathogenesis has been confirmed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura: current strategies for investigation and management|first1 = Bethan|last1 = Psaila|first2 = James B.|last2 = Bussel|journal = [[British Journal of Haematology]]|year = 2008|volume = 143|issue = 1|pages = 16–26|doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07275.x|pmid = 18573111}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[off-label use]] of the [[vinca alkaloid|''vinca'' alkaloid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = van der Heijden|first1 = Robert|last2 = Jacobs|first2 = Denise I.|last3 = Snoeijer|first3 = Wim|last4 = Hallard|first4 = Didier|last5 = Verpoorte|first5 = Robert|year = 2004|title = The ''Catharanthus'' alkaloids: Pharmacognosy and biotechnology|journal = [[Current Medicinal Chemistry]]|volume = 11|issue = 5|pages = 607–628|pmid = 15032608|doi = 10.2174/0929867043455846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Raviña|first = Enrique|title = The evolution of drug discovery: From traditional medicines to modern drugs|year = 2011|publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn = 9783527326693|pages = 157–159|chapter = Vinca alkaloids|chapter-url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=iDNy0XxGqT8C&amp;pg=PA157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter = Africa's gift to the world|pages = 46–51|chapter-url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=aXGmCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46|title = Botanical Miracles: Chemistry of Plants That Changed the World|first1 = Raymond|last1 = Cooper|first2 = Jeffrey John|last2 = Deakin|publisher = [[CRC Press]]|year = 2016|isbn = 9781498704304}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[chemotherapy]] agent [[vincristine]] may be attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Kuboyama|first1 = Takeshi|last2 = Yokoshima|first2 = Satoshi|last3 = Tokuyama|first3 = Hidetoshi|last4 = Fukuyama|first4 = Tohru|title = Stereocontrolled total synthesis of (+)-vincristine|journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|year = 2004|volume = 101|issue = 33|pages = 11966–11970|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0401323101|pmid = 15141084|pmc = 514417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = MoleculesReview&gt;{{cite journal|journal = [[Molecules (journal)|Molecules]]|year = 2012|volume = 17|issue = 5|pages = 5893–5914|doi = 10.3390/molecules17055893|title = Modifications on the basic skeletons of vinblastine and vincristine|first1 = Péter|last1 = Keglevich|first2 = Laszlo|last2 = Hazai|first3 = György|last3 = Kalaus|first4 = Csaba|last4 = Szántay|pmid = 22609781|url = http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/17/5/5893/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, vincristine has significant [[Vincristine#Side effects|side effects]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Autoimmune Thrombocytopenia|editor1-first = Yoji|editor1-last = Ishida|editor2-first = Yoshiaki|editor2-last = Tomiyama|publisher = [[Springer Nature]]|year = 2017|isbn = 9789811041426|url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=xcgmDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=vincristine&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its use in treating ITP must be approached with caution, especially in children.

===Intravenous immunoglobulin===
[[Intravenous immunoglobulin]] (IVIg) may be infused in some cases in order to decrease the rate at which  [[macrophage]]s consume [[antibody]]-tagged platelets.&amp;nbsp; However, while sometimes effective, it is costly and produces improvement that generally lasts less than a month.&amp;nbsp; Nevertheless, in the case of an ITP patient already scheduled for [[surgery]] who has a dangerously low platelet count and has experienced a poor response to other treatments, IVIg can rapidly increase platelet counts, and can also help reduce the risk of major bleeding by transiently increasing platelet counts.

===Thrombopoietin receptor agonists===
{{Main|Thrombopoietic agent}}

Side effects of thrombopoietin receptor agonists include headache, joint or muscle pain, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, and an increased risk of blood clots.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"/&gt;

===Surgery===
[[Splenectomy]] (removal of the [[spleen]]) may be considered in patients who are either unresponsive to steroid treatment, have frequent relapses, or cannot be tapered off steroids after a few months. Platelets which have been bound by antibodies are taken up by [[macrophages]] in the spleen (which have [[Fc receptors]]), and so removal of the spleen reduces platelet destruction.&amp;nbsp; The procedure is potentially risky in ITP cases due to the increased possibility of significant bleeding during surgery.&amp;nbsp; Durable remission following splenectomy is achieved in 75 percent of ITP cases.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.itpsupport.org.uk/american/%205.%20Splenectomy%20in%20ITP.pdf, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=July 2018}} The use of splenectomy to treat ITP has diminished since the development of steroid therapy and other pharmaceutical remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bhatt |first1=NS |last2=Bhatt |first2=P |last3=Donda |first3=K |last4=Dapaah-Siakwan |first4=F |last5=Chaudhari |first5=R |last6=Linga |first6=VG |last7=Patel |first7=B |last8=Lekshminarayanan |first8=A |last9=Bhaskaran |first9=S |last10=Zaid-Kaylani |first10=S |last11=Badawy |first11=SM |title=Temporal trends of splenectomy in pediatric hospitalizations with immune thrombocytopenia. |journal=Pediatric Blood and Cancer |date=September 20, 2018 |volume=65 |issue=7 |pages=e27072 |doi=10.1002/pbc.27072 |pmid=29637697 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Platelet transfusion===
Platelet transfusion alone is normally not recommended except in an emergency, and is usually unsuccessful in producing a long-term platelet count increase.&amp;nbsp; This is because the underlying autoimmune mechanism that is destroying the patient's platelets will also destroy donor platelets, and so platelet transfusions are ''not'' considered a long-term treatment option.

===''H. pylori'' eradication===
In adults, particularly those living in areas with a high prevalence of ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' (which normally inhabits the stomach wall and has been associated with [[peptic ulcer]]s), identification and treatment of this infection has been shown to improve platelet counts in a third of patients. In a fifth, the platelet count normalized completely; this response rate is similar to that found in treatment with rituximab, which is more expensive and less safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stasi R, Sarpatwari A, Segal JB, Osborn J, Evangelista ML, Cooper N, Provan D, Newland A, Amadori S, Bussel JB | title=Effects of eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura: a systematic review | journal=Blood | year=2009 | volume=113 | pages=1231–40 | pmid=18945961 | doi=10.1182/blood-2008-07-167155  | url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/113/6/1231.long | issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In children, this approach is not supported by evidence, except in high prevalence areas.

== Epidemiology ==
A normal platelet count is considered to be in the range of 150,000&amp;ndash;450,000 per microlitre (μl) of blood for most healthy individuals.&amp;nbsp; Hence one may be considered thrombocytopenic below that range, although the threshold for a diagnosis of ITP is not tied to any specific number.

The incidence of ITP is estimated at 50&amp;ndash;100 new cases per million per year, with children accounting for half of that amount.&amp;nbsp; At least 70 percent of childhood cases will end up in remission within six months, even without treatment.&lt;ref name="pmid15494875"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Watts RG |title=Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: a 10-year natural history study at the children's hospital of Alabama |journal=Clinical Pediatrics |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=691–702 |year=2004 |pmid=15494875|doi=10.1177/000992280404300802}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17460024"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Treutiger I, Rajantie J, Zeller B, Henter JI, Elinder G, Rosthøj S |title=Does treatment of newly diagnosed idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura reduce morbidity? |journal=Arch.

The [[mortality rate]] due to chronic ITP varies but tends to be higher relative to the general population for any age range.&amp;nbsp; In a study conducted in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], it was noted that ITP causes an approximately 60 percent higher rate of mortality compared to gender- and age-matched subjects without ITP.&amp;nbsp; This increased risk of death with ITP is largely concentrated in the [[middle age|middle-aged]] and [[elderly]].&amp;nbsp; Ninety-six percent of reported ITP-related deaths were individuals 45 years or older.&amp;nbsp; No significant difference was noted in the rate of survival between males and females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Schoonen WM, Kucera G, Coalson J, etal |title=Epidemiology of immune thrombocytopenic purpura in the General Practice Research Database |journal=Br.

== Pregnancy ==
Anti-platelet autoantibodies in a pregnant woman with ITP will attack the patient's own platelets and will also cross the placenta and react against fetal platelets.  Therefore, ITP is a significant cause of fetal and neonatal immune thrombocytopenia.  Approximately 10% of newborns affected by ITP will have platelet counts &lt;50,000/uL and 1% to 2% will have a risk of intracerebral hemorrhage comparable to infants with [[neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia]] (NAIT).&lt;ref name="Roback 2008"&gt;Roback et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda, AABB Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Webert KE, Mittal R, Sigouin C, Heddle NM, Kelton JG |title=A retrospective 11-year analysis of obstetric patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura |journal=Blood |volume=102 |issue=13 |pages=4306–11 |date=December 2003 |pmid=12947011 |doi=10.1182/blood-2002-10-3317 |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12947011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No lab test can reliably predict if neonatal thrombocytopenia will occur.  The risk of neonatal thrombocytopenia is increased with:&lt;ref name="Mais DD 2009"&gt;Mais DD. ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology. Chicago: ASCP Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mothers with a history of splenectomy for ITP
* Mothers who had a previous infant affected with ITP
* Gestational (maternal) platelet count less than 100,000/uL

It is recommended that pregnant women with thrombocytopenia or a previous diagnosis of ITP should be tested for serum antiplatelet antibodies.  A woman with symptomatic thrombocytopenia and an identifiable antiplatelet antibody should be started on therapy for their ITP which may include steroids or IVIG.  Fetal blood analysis to determine the platelet count is not generally performed as ITP-induced thrombocytopenia in the fetus is generally less severe than NAIT. Platelet transfusions may be performed in newborns, depending on the degree of thrombocytopenia. It is recommended that neonates be followed with serial platelet counts for the first few days after birth.&lt;ref name="Roback 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mais DD 2009"/&gt;

==History==
After initial reports by the Portuguese physician [[Amato Lusitano]] in 1556 and Lazarus de la Rivière (physician to the King of France) in 1658, it was the German physician and poet [[Paul Gottlieb Werlhof]] who in 1735 wrote the most complete initial report of the purpura of ITP.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32474">The '''Organic law  15/1999 of December 13 about protection of Personal Data''', ('''LOPD'''), is an [[organic law]] [[Spain|Spanish]] that guarantees and protects the processing of personal data, public liberties and [[fundamental human rights]], and especially of their personal and family [[honor]] and [[privacy]].  It was approved by the [[Cortes Generales|General Court]] on December 13, 1999. This law is developed based on Article 18 of the [[Spanish Constitution | Spanish Constitution of 1978]], on familiar and personal[[right to privacy]] and the secrecy of communications.

Its main objective is to regulate the treatment of data and files, of a personal nature, regardless of the support in which they are treated, the rights of citizens over them and the obligations of those who create or treat them. This law affects all data that refers to registered humans on any support, computer or otherwise. Excluded from this regulation are those data collected for domestic use, classified materials of the state and those files that collect data on Terrorism and other forms of [[organized crime]] (not simple delinquency).

Based on this law, the Spanish Agency for Data Protection was created, at the state level, which ensures compliance with this Law.

== Regulatory development ==
* The Royal Decree 994/1999 on Security Measures for automated files that containing personal data of June 11, 1999 (RMS): It is a regulation that develops the Organic Law 5/1992, of October 29, of Regulation of the Automated Treatment of Personal Data (LORTAD), regulates the technical and organizational measures that must be applied to the information systems in which personal data are processed in an automated way. (Repealed since April 19 of 2010)
* The Royal Decree 1720/2007, of December 21 on the development of the Organic Law on Data Protection. It is a development of the Organic Law 15/99 of Data Protection of December 13; develops the principles of the law, and the security measures to be applied in the information systems. It applies to files in automated support, as in any other type of media.

== Control bodies and possible sanctions ==
The body responsible for monitoring compliance with data protection regulations at Spanish territory, in general, is the Spanish Agency for Data Protection (AEPD), 
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.agpd.es/portalweb/index-ides-idphp.php Spanish Agency for Data Protection]&lt;/ref&gt; there are other Data Protection Agencies of an autonomous nature, in [[Autonomous Communities]] of [[Catalonia]] and in [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].

The sanctions are divided into three groups depending on the seriousness of the act committed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samuelparra.com/empresas-multadas/ List of companies sanctioned in 2009] List of companies that are being sanctioned during the year 2009, indicating the amount imposed and the date. It also reflects the "Top 3" of the most sanctioned companies during this period, total amount in euros of all sanctions and other statistical information&lt;/ref&gt; Spain being the country of the European Union that has the highest sanctions in terms of protection of data. These sanctions depend on the violation committed. The last company sanctioned has been the company Grupon, sanctioned by the state data protection agency, with 20&amp;nbsp;000 euros  for storing the CVV codes of the Credit cards from their customers without informing them.

They are divided into:

{{cita|
The minor penalties range from 900 to 40&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;€

Serious penalti range from 40&amp;nbsp;001 a 300&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;€

Very serious penalties range from 300&amp;nbsp;001 a 600&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;€
}}

Despite the amount of sanctions, there are many [[companies]] in [[Spain]] that have not yet adapted to it, or have done so in a partial manner or do not periodically review its adequacy; so that, maintenance and review of the adequacy carried out is essential.

In the public sector, the mentioned Law also regulates the use and management of information and files with personal data used by all public administrations.

The Spanish Agency for Data Protection ([[AEPD]]) was created in 1994 in accordance with the provisions of the repealed LORTAD. Its headquarters are located in Madrid, although the Autonomous Communities of Madrid, the Basque Country and Catalonia have created their own autonomous Agencies.

In 2012 complaints filed with the [[Agency for data protection|AEPD]], increased by 12%. The activity of the Agency has grown significantly in 2012, with an increase of 15% in the files registered and almost 40% in the resolutions issued. The allegations of identity theft, especially in the supply and commercialization of energy and water (222%) and in telecommunications (92%), have experienced a substantial increase. Of the 863 infringement decisions declared to private managers, more than 34% concluded in a warning, without imposing a penalty. On the other hand, most of the sanctions affect the telecommunications sector, which represents 73% of the total. Three of the main operators accumulate 70.94% of the total amount of fines.

==== [http://www.agpd.es/portalwebAGPD/canaldocumentacion/memorias/memoria_2011/common/Memoria_2011.pdf Year 2011] ====
In 2011, reported complaints were 51.6% higher than those filed in 2010. This increase is also reflected in the increase in declaratory resolutions of infringement of 37.7%. However, the application of the figure of the warning has determined a decrease of 14.5% in the declared economic sanctions. The sector where sanctions have increased most (64%) and have been declared to a greater extent (25.5%) and amount, (63%) is that of telecommunications. The amount of sanctions has grown by 12% compared to 2010.

==== Year 2008 ====
In 2008 the number of facts reported to the AEPD (together with officio investigations initiated) increased by more than 45%, reaching the value of 2362. [[AEPD]] resolved in 2008 a total of 630 sanctioning procedures, almost 58% more than in 2007, of which 535 culminated with the imposition of sanctions. The fines imposed amounted to 22.6 million euros, representing an increase of 15% over the previous year.

The number of procedures solved of declarations of infraction committed by the public administrations rose in 2008 almost 20% with respect to the previous year, going from 66 to 79, of which 59 ended with a declaration of infraction.

==== Year 2007 ====
In 2007 the Spanish Agency for Data Protection resolved 399 sanctioning procedures, increasing by 32.5% with respect to the previous year. The economic sanctions imposed by the AEPD amounted to 19&amp;nbsp;600&amp;nbsp;000 [[euros]].

=== Autonomous data protection agencies ===

==== Year 2007 ====
The Data Protection Agency of the Community of Madrid carried out 196 inspection procedures and 32 procedures for the protection of rights in 2007.

The Basque Data Protection Agency-Datuak Babesteko Euskal Bulegoa (AVDP-DBEB), resolved 43 complaints and 18 infringement procedures in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdfdownload.org/pdf2html/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.avpd.euskadi.net%2Fs04-5249%2Fes%2Fcontenidos%2Finformacion%2Fmemorias_anuales%2Fes_mem2007%2Fadjuntos%2Fcifras.pdf&amp;images=yes Report of the basque agency 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ibero-American Data Protection Network ===

The Ibero-American Data Protection Network (RIPD), since its creation in 2003, has developed an intense and fruitful work, such as the organization of ten meetings. In addition to contributing to that more than 150 million Latin American citizens currently have, along with the traditional protection of [[habeas data]], rules that allow to effectively guarantee the use of their personal information and specialized authorities with powers to protect said guarantee.

In [[Latin America]] policies are being developed for the protection of personal data. In 2012 two new laws were approved. In [[Nicaragua]], Law No. 787 of Protection of Personal Data, of March 29, 2012 and Statutory Law No. 1581 of October 17, 2012, by which general provisions for the Protection of Personal Data are issued.

In [[Chile]], also Law 19.628, of August 28, 1999, on Protection of Private Life, is currently in the process of reviewing part of its articles.

The [[National Assembly of Venezuela]] is processing the bill for the Protection of Personal Data of Habeas Data. And in [[Costa Rica]] there is already a Data Protection Agency of the Republic of Costa Rica, in compliance with the law approved in 2011.

== Information Duty ==

Personal data are classified according to their greater or lesser degree of sensitivity, being the legal requirements and computer security measures more stringent in terms of this greater degree of sensitivity, being mandatory on the other hand, in any case the declaration of the data protection files to the "Spanish Agency for Data Protection".

Interested parties to which personal data are requested must be previously informed in an express, precise and unambiguous way:

1. The existence of a file or treatment of personal data, the purpose of the collection of these and the recipients of the information.

2. Of the obligatory or optional character of his answer to the questions that are posed to them.

3. The consequences of obtaining the data or the refusal to supply them.

4. Of the possibility of exercising rights of access, rectification, cancellation and opposition.

5. The identity and address of the person responsible for the treatment or, if applicable, his representative.

However, the processing of personal data without having been collected directly from the affected party or interested party is permitted, although it is not exempted from the obligation to report expressly, accurately and unequivocally, by the person responsible for the file or its representative, within of the three months following the start of data processing.

Exception: Communication in three months of such information will not be necessary if the data has been collected from "sources accessible to the public",&lt;ref&gt;defined as those "files whose consultation can be carried out, by any person, not prevented by a rule limitative or without further requirement that, where appropriate, the payment of a consideration "and" are considered as sources of public access, exclusively, the promotional census, telephone directories (...) and lists of persons belonging to groups of professionals (...) Also, the newspapers and official bulletins and the media have the character of public access sources ". "In each communication addressed to the interested party will be informed of the origin of the data and the identity of the person responsible for the treatment, as well as the rights that assist".&lt;/ref&gt; and are intended for advertising or commercial prospecting , in this case "in each communication addressed to the interested party, he will be informed of the origin of the data and the identity of the person responsible for the treatment, as well as the rights that assist him".

; Model clause

This could be a model clause of information / consent of rights protected by the LOPD:

{{cita | In compliance with the Organic Law 15/1999, of December 13, Protection of Personal Data (LOPD), (replace by the name of the person responsible for the file), as the person in charge of the file, reports the following considerations:

The personal data that we request, will be incorporated into a file whose purpose is (describe the purpose).
The fields marked with an asterisk (or any other signal) are mandatory, being impossible to realize the expressed purpose if you do not provide this information.

You are also informed of the possibility of exercising the rights of access, rectification, cancellation and opposition, of your personal data in (substitute the address to exercise the rights).}}

; Data whose treatment is prohibited

* Those relating to "criminal or administrative infractions".
* Exception: They can only be included in files of the competent public administrations.

== Consent ==

=== Types of consent ===
A) Unmistakable consent

The treatment of personal data will require the unambiguous consent of the affected party, unless the law provides otherwise.

B) Tacit Consent

This will be the normal form of consent in cases where an express or express consent is not required in writing.

C) Express consent

Personal data referring to racial origin, health and sexual life may only be collected, processed and assigned when, for reasons of general interest, it is provided by a law or the person expressly consents.

D) Express and written consent

Express consent is required in writing from the affected party regarding data related to ideology, union affiliation, religion and beliefs and may only be transferred with express consent.&lt;ref&gt;«The files kept by political parties, trade unions, churches are excepted , confessions or religious communities and associations, foundations and other non-profit entities, whose purpose is political, philosophical, religious or union, in terms of data relating to its members or members (... and) for the prevention or for the medical diagnosis, the provision of health care or medical treatment or the management of health services (... and) to safeguard the vital interest of the affected person or of another person, in the event that the affected person is physically or legally incapable of giving your consent. »&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data communication ==

They have responsibility in the communication and treatment of data not only the [[legal persons]] ([[companies]]) but also freelancers, freelancers, associations, collectives and people who own a [[blog]] (bloggers) through from which data from third parties are collected to make queries and for any other transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cita web
| url	= http://queesunpersonalshopper.com/asesoramiento-de-comunicacion/lopd/
 | title = LOPD and LSSI for SMEs, freelancers, associations and blogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The personal data object of the treatment can only be communicated to a third party for the fulfillment of purposes directly related to the legitimate functions of the transferor and the transferee with the prior consent of the interested party.

The consent required in the previous section will not be precise:
# When the assignment is authorized by law.
# In the case of data collected from sources accessible to the public.
# When the treatment responds to the free and legitimate acceptance of a legal relationship whose development, compliance and control necessarily implies the connection of said treatment with third-party files. In this case the communication will only be legitimate as long as it is limited to the purpose that justifies it.
# When the communication to be made is addressed to the Ombudsman, the Public Prosecutor or the Judges or Courts or the Court of Accounts, in the exercise of the functions assigned to it. Neither will consent be required when the communication is addressed to autonomous institutions with analogous functions to the Ombudsman or the Court of Auditors.
# When the transfer occurs between Public Administrations and has as its objective the subsequent processing of the data for historical, statistical or scientific purposes.
# When the transfer of personal data related to health is necessary to solve an emergency that requires access to a file or to perform epidemiological studies in the terms established in the legislation on state or regional health.

The consent for the communication of personal data to a third party will be void when the information provided to the interested party does not allow him to know the purpose to which the data will be destined whose communication is authorized or the type of activity of the person to whom it is sent. They intend to communicate.

The consent for the communication of personal data also has a revocable nature.

The one to whom the personal data are communicated is obliged, by the mere fact of the communication, to observe the provisions of this Law.

If the communication is made prior to the dissociation procedure, the provisions of the previous sections will not apply.

== Access to the data by third parties ==
# The access of a third party to the data will not be considered as data communication when said access is necessary for the provision of a service to the data controller.
# The performance of treatments on behalf of third parties must be regulated in a contract that must be recorded in writing or in some other form that allows proof of its conclusion and content, establishing expressly that the processor will only process the data according to the instructions of the person in charge of the treatment, which will not apply them or use them for purposes other than those stated in said contract, nor will they communicate them, even for their preservation, to other persons. &lt;br&gt; The contract will stipulate, in addition, the security measures to which refers to article 9 of this Law that the person in charge of the treatment is obliged to implement.
# Once the contractual provision has been fulfilled, the personal data must be destroyed or returned to the data controller, as well as any support or documents that contain any personal data object of the treatment.
# In the event that the person in charge of the treatment allocates the data for another purpose, communicates them or uses them in breach of the stipulations of the contract, it will also be considered responsible for the treatment, responding to the infractions that would have been incurred personally.

== Criticisms and main problems ==
Certain aspects of the law were declared unconstitutional in November 2000 and deleted from the current text.

It is considered that the increase in the creation of files and processing of personal data affects the right to protection of citizens' data; This concern was picked up by the European bodies that even ordered that January 28 be held annually on "[[European Data Protection Day]]". The celebration dates back to 2006, when the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe established the annual celebration of the Data Protection Day in Europe on January 28, commemorating the anniversary of the signing of [[Convention 108 of the Council of Europe for the protection of persons with regard to the automated processing of personal data]].

A very strict compliance with the regulation on data protection could slow down the normal work of a File Manager for the documentary accreditation of the information and consent principles of the LOPD; also in the opposite direction, a mere fulfillment of formal obligations, would leave the law senseless and the citizens unprotected and go against the "spirit" of the LOPD.

The possibility that companies can collect data without the consent of the affected has been criticized.

Certain resolutions of the AEPD &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.agpd.es/portalweb/resoluciones/procedimientos_sancionadores/index-ides-idphp.php Some resolutions of the AEPD on its website]&lt;/ref&gt; have been reason for controversy:

* In October 2008, the [[Spanish Agency for Data Protection]] sanctioned the Popular Party ([[People's Party (Spain)|PP]]), then in opposition, with a fine of 60 &amp; nbsp; 101.21 euros for a serious infringement of the [[Organic Law of Protection of Personal Data]] consisting of the inclusion, without their consent, of four [[O Grove]] neighbors as "false volunteers" of the election lists of [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] of May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farodevigo.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=2008100100_17_262785__Arousa-Proteccion-Datos-multa-falsos-voluntarios-listas-vascas Data Protection fine to the PP for the 'voluntary volunteers' of the Basque lists]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavozdegalicia.com/galicia/2008/10/01/0003_7186065.htm Data Protection fine to the PP for the "false volunteers" from the Basque lists]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The possibility offered by some websites to "send a friend" certain information, or "recommend this page to a friend" have also been sanctioned in strict application of the LOPD &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eleconomista.es/economia/noticias/485871/04/08/Ojo-al-enviar-datos-a-un-amigo-Proteccion-de-Datos-considera-que-es-sancionable.html Beware of sending data "to a friend! Protection of Data considers that it is punishable] "Recommend this page to a friend." If on your website this self-promotion formula appears, know that this option has the days counted, if you do not want to receive a fine. Data this practice violates the Law of Services of the Information Society and Electronic Commerce (LSSI), which does not foresee that you can send any mail with advertising or promotional content, if it is reflected in a Resolution of the Agency, of February 20 of 2008, in which a webpage is fined for offering the internaut The ease of sending an informative message to the email address of a family member or friend inviting the recipient to register.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.error500.net/agencia-proteccion-datos-enviar-amigo The Agency of data protection against "send to a friend"] Stone remains one before the sanction of the Data Protection Agency to a website with the option of "send to a friend", that mechanism which many try to get their most convinced users invite their friends and family. The information is given, among others, The economist and on the website of the Data Protection Agency you can access the resolution (in PDF format).&lt;/ref&gt;
* La AEPD también resolvió que los datos relativos a los abortos practicados eran confidenciales, a raíz de la denuncias criminales interpuestas contra varias clínicas por presuntos abortos irregulares&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/politica/noticias/477254/04/08/La-Agencia-de-Proteccion-de-Datos-exige-respetar-la-confidencialidad-en-los-abortos.html «La Agencia de Protección de Datos exige respetar la confidencialidad en los abortos.»] La polémica en torno al aborto se desató a principios de este año. Las clínicas abortistas organizaron una huelga para protestar por las presiones recibidas por sus profesionales y por las investigaciones iniciadas en varios centros de Madrid y Barcelona por presuntos abortos irregulares... Por último, el documento establece que el acceso por parte de los órganos de inspección sanitaria será permitido cuando su finalidad sea la "comprobación de la calidad de la asistencia, el respeto de los derechos del paciente o cualquier otra obligación del centro en relación con los pacientes y usuarios o la propia Administración sanitaria".&lt;/ref&gt;
* The AEPD also resolved that the data regarding the abortions practiced were confidential, as a result of the criminal complaints filed against several clinics for alleged irregular abortions &lt;ref&gt;[http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/politica/noticias/477254/04/08/La-Agencia-de-Proteccion-de-Datos-exige-respetar-la-confidencialidad-en-los-abortos.html «The Data Protection Agency demands to respect the confidentiality in abortions.»] The controversy about abortion was unleashed earlier this year. The abortion clinics organized a strike to protest the pressure received by their professionals and the investigations initiated in several centers in Madrid and Barcelona for alleged irregular abortions ... Finally, the document states that access by inspection bodies sanitary will be allowed when its purpose is "checking the quality of care, respect for the rights of the patient or any other obligation of the center in relation to patients and users or the health administration itself."&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2008, a judgment of the Supreme Court declared that the "baptismal books" of the [[Catholic Church]] are not "data files", disavowing a resolution of October 20, 2006 issued by the Spanish Agency for the Protection of Data; the agency had given the reason to an apostate who requested that, through the Agency, his inscription in the Baptism Book be canceled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://derechoynormas.blogspot.com/2008/10/la-agencia-de-proteccin-de-datos-y-la.html «The Agency for Data Protection and apostasy.»] «Data Protection paralyzes the processing of apostasy requests. Frenazo for the more than half a thousand requests for apostasy that were to be resolved in the Spanish Agency for Data Protection (AEPD), and all those that may continue to arrive: The director of the AEPD, Artemi Rallo, announced yesterday that all these requests for cancellation of data in the baptismal books are suspended until new judicial decisions confirm or move away from the judgment of the Supreme Court last September, which, for the first time, exempted the ecclesiastical hierarchy from making a note of apostasy in the baptismal books. »(It has the sentence of the TS in PDF format)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Due to breaches of data protection legislation, several insurers and health centers have been sanctioned, since they exchanged medical information about patients without their express consent. However, they are subject to reduced sanctions for not being assessed "intentionality in the commission of the offense" &lt;ref&gt;[Data Protection, new fine to a health entity] That is why the AEPD imposes a fine of 60.101,27 euros for a very serious infraction, and another for the same amount and causes the plaintiff's doctor. Very serious faults are usually punishable by fines between 300&amp;nbsp;506and601&amp;nbsp;012 euros. In this case, the agency recognizes mitigating factors such as' there was no intentionality in the commission of the infringement, there is no recidivism, and the report was requested to avoid harm to the company, since the complainant had said that she was not suffering from venous insufficiency varicose veins when he had it.

Is a simple medical prescription with the name of a medicine a health fact, even if the specific disease is not reflected? Are the measurements of a person, such as the size of the foot, or for example the color of the eyes, considered health data? ...&lt;/ref&gt;
* AEPD sanctioned a company after a hacker attempted to blackmail it by finding a hole in its security and later denounced it &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumer.es/web/es/tecnologia/2008/03/17/175496.php "Data Protection fines Telefónica with 60,000 euros."] The agency considered the high level of computer knowledge of the complainant proved, as well as its lucrative spirit, which "bordered on the criminal offense and notoriety of a" pirate ", according to the content of the resolution, its opinion is supported by article 9 of the Organic Law of Protection of Personal Data that establishes the principle of" data security ", imposing the obligation to adopt the measures of technical and organizational nature that guarantee their security, with the purpose of avoiding the unauthorized access In any case, the fine imposed by the regulatory agency is of "minimum amount" because it maintains that there was no intention nalidad by Telefonica. However, the company has announced its intention to file an appeal against this resolution.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The LOPD continues to have gaps and social agents have requested certain reforms. In August 2008, [[Bernat Soria]], Socialist Minister of Health and Consumer Affairs stated that action would be taken to create a law against companies that were making commercial calls not consented to homes, usually at meal times, which was a behavior popularly known as "[[telephone spam]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legaltoday.com/index.php/actualidad/noticias/recibir-llamadas-publicitarias-no-solicitadas-en-el-limite-de-la-legislacion "Receive unsolicited advertising calls, within the limits of the legislation."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/Cerco/telefonazos/basura/elpepusoc/20080815elpepisoc_2/Tes «Fence to the 'junk calls'.] The Government wants to end the unsolicited calls, with the annoying and increasingly frequent telephone spam, with ringing at the time of nap to the fixed or to the mobile to offer a change of operator, a new credit or an offer of connection to Int ernet, often produced from "private numbers" or "unknown" or local locutions or from abroad, which makes it impossible for the consumer to report it. The Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs in collaboration with the Ministry of Justice, Economy and Industry are working on a preliminary bill to transpose a European directive that considers this practice illegal. The Government expects to enter into force before the end of the year ... "Many are also produced at the time of siesta or at night, which makes them even more annoying," adds the head of Health and Consumption. Until now these practices were not regulated in a specific way. There is a law (of 2002) that prohibits unwanted email. ('' [[El Pais]] '', August 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lift irrigation''' is a method of [[irrigation]] in which water is not transported by natural flow, (as in [[gravity-fed canal]]) but is lifted with [[pump]]s or [[surge pool]]s etc.

==Overview==
Lift irrigation schemes must accomplish two main tasks: first, to carry water by means of [[pump]]s or other way, from the water source to the main delivery chamber, which is situated at the top most point in the command area.  Second. they must distribute this water to the field of the beneficiary farmers by means of a suitable and proper distribution.
So that in Lift Irrigation system, the gravity flow of water by [[canal]]s or river is not available or used.

==Distribution==
Of these two issues, distribution is the most complex, for several reasons.  First, whereas the system for collecting water at the main delivery chamber makes use of pumps, the distribution system is typically completely gravity-based, and have to be designed solely on the basis of the available [[hydraulic head]].  In addition, the area to be irrigated is scattered and has varying [[topography]], and each farm is of a different size, so it can be a challenge to design a gravity-based system that allots each farmer a fair amount of water.  Several mechanisms have been developed to meet these challenges.

In the most prevalent system, the area under irrigation is divided into different blocks according to topography determined by contour plan.  The water requirement for each block is determined, and pipe lines are designed for these blocks depending on the available head and required discharge.  Field delivery chambers are then constructed on the distribution pipe lines, and valves are fitted to control the flow of the pipe lines, with flow from the main delivery chamber controlled by these valves.  In this system, lines for lower fields have more discharge, because the force of gravity is greater, so water distribution can be unequal.

In other systems, the area is divided into three or four equal parts, and each part is given the entire discharge for one day. This means each part gets rotation of the full design discharge on the fourth or fifth day.  Again, however, water distribution can be unequal, and alternate methods of distribution have been proposed to deal with this problem.

==About Lift Irrigation ==
In LI water is lifted from lower level to higher level with the help of pumps and other equipment.
Construction of dams and canals helped tremendously to increase the irrigated area lying at lower level than the dam level, but scarcity of water remained the problem for higher level areas. So as to bring higher level area under irrigation L.I.S. are taken up.The 8% of Maharashtra irrigation is occupied by lift irrigation.

==Advantages of Lift Irrigation==
#Lift irrigation made irrigation possible at higher level.
#Land acquisition problem in L.I.S. is less.
#Water losses are low.
#Man power is less used.

==Requirements of Lift Irrigation System (LIS)==
:''Water Source''-Suitable and constant water source should be available for whole year at the site of LIS. Water can be made available through Dams, Weir, River canal etc.
:''Lifting Medium''-To lift water to the desired location, lifting medium i.e. pumps are required. Depending upon the Duty point head, discharge the different types of pumps are selected.
:''Conveying Medium''-Rising main may be of steel, concrete or any other suitable material.

==Lift Irrigation Scheme in Telangana==
In India, the [[National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development]] reports that there are 1401 lift irrigation schemes financed by them.  These schemes irrigate 22000 hectares of land, and have a total financial outlay of Rs. 6462.5 million. However, as many as 573 of these schemes are defunct, mainly due to poor distribution of water. Other schemes have been financed by the [[Government of India|government]], sugar factories, or individual farmers. 

Water shortage is a huge predicament for a country like India which still relies on monsoon rains for much of its agricultural practices. As weather patterns become increasingly uncertain with time, most likely due to global warming, being prepared to cope with water shortages in the future is essential. Rural communities as well as huge population which are greatly affected by [[water scarcity]] are the people living in drought-prone areas or in semi-arid up-lands. Much of these disadvantaged areas are also inhibited by tribal villages in many parts of India and are also backward in agricultural practices. These tribal villages are mainly self-sustained in their living habits and rely heavily on the paddy crops for endurance. It is becoming progressively more intricate to maintain tribal lifestyle due to uncertain weather patterns resulting in dwindling of agricultural production over time and all the more increasing the burden on state to raise their standard of living in terms of food security, education, and health care. It is also seen, when time gets tough, villagers generally tend to migrate on a seasonal basis to seek other means of livelihood. Such seasonal migration of entire village population also affects their settled life hampering their children’s education as well as their access to other developmental support coming from state.

It is consequently important to help their agriculture instead in order to reduce the incidence of migration in such areas. This can only be achieved by ensuring there is sufficient crop to feed villagers and to sell at market to allow income generation. Irrigation is the essential input to the soil for any vegetation to grow. It is used to lend a hand in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and potentials of vegetation by restoring humidity / humus in depleted soils of dry areas and during periods of insufficient rainfall. Additionally, irrigation also has a few other uses in crop production, which include shielding plants against frost, suppressing weed and wild vegetation in grain fields and helping in preventing soil conservation. In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed agriculture, or if it falls in semi-arid regions, it is called dry land farming. Irrigation is often studied together with drainage, which is the natural or artificial removal of surface and sub-surface water from a given area. Various types of irrigation techniques differ in how the water obtained from the source, and is distributed within the field. In general, the aim is to supply water homogeneously to the entire field, so that each land patch has enough amount of water it needs, neither too much nor too little. Irrigation Schemes primarily comprises canal irrigation and lift irrigation schemes. In such schemes, the most important and yet the most neglected part is the local ownership and institutions of farmers taking operative and m responsibilities.

==Participatory Irrigation Management==
The main purpose of the irrigation reform programme in Andhra Pradesh is to improve the sustainability and productivity of irrigation through sharing irrigation management responsibility with the farmers organized as Water Users Associations. Towards this the State government enacted the Andhra Pradesh Farmers Management of Irrigation System Act in 1997. Presently, water users’ organizations under the APFMIS Act is constituted at three different levels in major irrigation projects - Water Users Associations (WUAs) at the minor canal level, Distributor Committees (DCs) at the distributor canal level and Project Committee (PCs) at the main canal level. In medium irrigation project they are constituted at two levels – WUA at the minor canal level and PC at the main canal level. In minor irrigation tanks only a WUA is constituted covering the whole tank command. A total of 10,748 WUAs have been constituted – 2261 in major irrigation projects, 410 in medium irrigation projects and 8077 in minor irrigation tanks.

The water users’ organizations undertake the responsibilities of seasonal crop planning and irrigation water regulation, O&amp;M works on canal system and assist in tax collection. To facilitate the functioning of the water users’ organizations the State government re-ploughs 100% of the irrigation water tax collected from them. The water tax collection and [[plough back]] for O&amp;M to water users’ organizations over the last 5 years is given in the Table below:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naandi.org/anual_report/2004-2005.pdf Naandi Annual Report 2004-2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naandi.org/anual_report/1_Naandi_AR%2805-06%29.pdf Naandi Annual Report 2005-2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="li_case"&gt;[http://liftirrigation.org/html/case_study.html Case study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207025644/http://liftirrigation.org/html/case_study.html |date=2005-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance of Lift Irrigation Schemes in AP==
In Andhra Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh State Irrigation Development Corporation (APSIDC) was established in 1974 to exploit the ground and surface water potential through lifts in a big way. Till now APSIDC has constructed around 1150 Lift Irrigation Schemes, creating an irrigation potential of 430000 acres. There are several LIS constructed by Irrigation &amp; Power Department, private farmers and farmer societies, creating an irrigation potential of about 2,70,000 acres. The schemes constructed by I &amp; P D are being maintained by the department even now. APSIDC has constructed some schemes with the share capital (25%) given by the government and the balance 75% capital raised through Nationalized banks refinanced by NABARD. These schemes were maintained by APSIDC (IDC) till 1995. Later all these schemes were either handed over to the farmer's societies for maintenance or kept under lock and key. Some other schemes were constructed by IDC on agency basis as deposit works. These were handed over either to the beneficiary societies or sponsoring agencies for maintenance after commissioning.&lt;ref name="li_case"/&gt;

==Maintenance of the LI Scheme by the Beneficiary Committee Society==
There are several parameters influencing the maintainability of LIS by the beneficiaries. The inter and intra village rivalries, the empowerment and social involvement levels of the farmers, the electricity tariff rates (now it has been made free), quality and quantity of power supply, the quality and performance of different components of the LIS and the performance of whole LIS as a system etc.
The Tyullar LIS was handed over to the beneficiaries during 2008. The scheme is being maintained by the beneficiaries successfully from 2008.

The profit and loss statement of the Tyullar LI Society shows that income over expenditure in the last 3 years is Rs 22, 12,551/- The society is cash rich and ready to meet any un-expected expenditure due to any contingency in the scheme. This ensures sustainability of maintenance by the society.

==Farmer’s Associations manage LI Schemes and pay for O&amp;M==
One of the main issues confronting irrigation system transfer is to decide on who would pay the cost of operation and maintenance of the system. APSIDC has handed over the LI schemes to Farmer’s Associations to operate, maintain and manage.
The Farmers’ Association members, who take over a scheme, will sign an agreement among themselves to share water as well as the cost of operation and maintenance equitably. The basis of each family’s contribution will be worked out by the members and included in the annex to the MOA between the FA and APSIDC. The SO will facilitate this process and may sign as a witness.

==Social Engineering Activities==
Capacity Building and community organization are the most important factors in strengthening the Lift Irrigation Societies. There are many defunct LI Schemes existing in [[Andhra Pradesh]], the main reason is the stakeholders did not have the capacity to run by themselves as per the guidelines envisaged. Therefore, the AP State Irrigation Development Corporation has decided to entrust the aspect of Social Engineering component to the identified NGO’s (Support Organization) with a view to make the scheme sustainable.

==History==
Started by Mark Bricklin in 1986&lt;ref&gt;[https://timetopics.com/ "Time Topics"] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=psa&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 100 U.S. Magazines by Circulation|url=http://www.psaresearch.com/images/TOPMAGAZINES.pdf|work=PSA Research Center|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a health magazine, ''Men's Health'' evolved into a lifestyle magazine, covering fitness, nutrition, relationships, travel, technology, fashion, and finance. Bricklin, Rodale editors Larry Stains and Stefan Bechtel produced three newsstand test issues. The results led Rodale to start ''Men's Health'' as a quarterly magazine in 1988 and begin to sell subscriptions. Bricklin, who was editor-in-chief of ''Prevention'' magazine, appointed Mike Lafavore as editor of ''Men's Health'' that year. In his 12 years as editor-in-chief, Lafavore increased the circulation from 100,000 to over 1.5 million, increased publication to ten 10 times a year, and expanded the magazine to Australia, France, Germany, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and the UK.

He created the editorial formula, hired [[Steven Slon]] from service journalism and [[Greg Gutfeld]] from ''Prevention''. He worked with longtime staff editor [[Denis Boyles]], a former ''Playboy'' contributing editor, to develop the magazine's voice. Lafavore left ''Men's Health'' in 2000, the same year Capell's Circulation Report named the magazine Circulation Performer of the Decade. He named Gutfeld his successor. After one year, Gutfeld was replaced by [[David Zinczenko]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/24/health/diagnosis-men-s-magazines-how-much-substance-behind-the-covers.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2|work=The New York Times|title=Diagnosis; Men's Magazines: How Much Substance Behind the Covers?|date=24 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/who-needs-topless-soap-stars-when-you-have-a-great-body-627205.html Who needs topless soap stars when you have a great body?]"&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated, "Since its debut in the late 1980's, the magazine has surpassed traditional men's books like ''Esquire'' and ''GQ'' by following the formula of best-selling women's magazines—by catering to men's anxieties about their bodies and sexual performance."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; ''Columbia Journalism Review'' stated the magazine "deals overwhelmingly with self-care and, in fact, exaggerates the possibilities for autonomous personal transformation." Editor-In-Chief Zinczenko argued that the magazine worked toward "overcoming the resistance of the 86-percent male audience to health as a subject" and redefining health as "inclusive of everything that could improve a man's life. Great sex. Great food. Endorphin-boosting exercise. Looking and feeling your best. We turned health into a concept every guy would want to embrace, starting with the healthy guy on the cover."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6998073/How-healthy-is-men-s.html|title=How healthy is men's health?

''Men's Health'' has been criticized for reusing cover taglines. Zinczenko replied that 80 percent of magazine sales are by subscription, and those covers differ from the newsstand version. "Twenty years of ''Men's Health'' has certainly produced several lines that have proven themselves effective at newsstand, which makes up about 20 percent of our print run. We plan to keep using the most effective marketing tools to reach the largest market we possibly can."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/print/mens-health-repeated-covers-clarification/|title=Further Clarification From Men’s Health: More on Repeated Cover Lines|work=Mediaite|date=December 11, 2009|accessdate=March 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, the magazine was criticized for including tiny credit lines on the cover rather than inside as a possible quid-pro-quo for advertisers. Zinczenko said the lines saved readers from having to dig for information and that ''Men's Health'' had been including the lines for over a year regardless of advertiser status. A spokesperson for the American Society of Magazine Editors said that no rules were broken. The director for print strategy at a media firm said the mention was "too small of a plug to get brands excited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/05/a-cover-credit-for-clothing/|work=The New York Times|author=Joseph Plambeck|title=A Cover Credit for Clothing|date=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global editions==
[[File:Men's Health June 2014 from four countries.png|thumb|right|300px|June 2014 issues of Australian, German, UK, and US editions showing the use of shared content, in this case a cover image from the same photo set of [[Hugh Jackman]]]]
Although ''Men's Health'' was founded in the U.S., its international editions have made it the world's largest men's magazine brand.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{cbignore|bot=medic}} These magazines reach over 71 million readers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rodale.com/brands/iconic-brands/mens-health/&lt;/ref&gt; ''Men's Health'' is published in 35 editions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

International editions account for over 80% of the magazine's trade volume. In each market, local editors commission or purchase articles for their own market and share content with US and other editions. The selected articles are then translated and edited by local staffers to make them match the style of the American edition. Usually, these editions started out as translations of the US version of the magazine, but over time many non-US editions became unique, providing material more pertinent to local readers.

'''Multifocal techniques''' are used in [[electroretinography|electroretinogram]] and [[visual evoked potential]] recordings to separate the responses originating from the stimulation of different locations in the [[visual field]] (and thus different [[retina]]l locations). 

The concept is as follows: Each visual field location is stimulated with a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] [[sequence]] that is [[correlation|uncorrelated]] to the sequences used for the other locations. All visual field locations are stimulated in parallel with their individual stimulus sequence. The retinal or cortical activity, which is a mixture of the responses from all visual field locations, is recorded with usual electroretinographic or visual evoked potential methods, respectively. Due to the independence of the stimulus sequences, the responses for each visual field location can be extracted using mathematical algorithms.

Mutifocal techniques, in particular the multifocal ERG, are used in the [[diagnosis]] of [[ophthalmology|ophthalmological]] diseases.

The '''National Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition''' (HMHB) was an [[United States|American]] [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1981 in response to the US Surgeon General’s conference on infant mortality. The mission was to improve the quality and reach of public and professional education related to prenatal and infant care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmhb.org/aboutus.html HMHB website], retrieved November 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The six lead organizations establishing HMHB were the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG), the [[March of Dimes]], the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP), the [[American Nurses Association]] (ANA), the [[National Congress of Parents and Teachers]], and the [[United States Public Health Service]].

HMHB’s mission evolved into a movement to improve the health and safety of mothers, babies and families through educational materials and [[collaborative partnerships]]. The coalition had membership of over 100 local, state and national organizations and does outreach, education and advocacy with healthcare professionals, parents and policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmhb.org/aboutus.html HMHB website], retrieved November 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the coalition’s goals: reducing infant mortality, premature birth and postpartum depression, as well as other health and safety issues facing mothers and infants.

In May 2015, the organization's operations moved to ZERO TO THREE, the National Center for Infants, Toddler and Families (ZTT).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmhb.org/2015/05/future-healthy-moms-babies/ HMHB blog post], retrieved September 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 2010, Federal Chief Technology Officer and an Associate Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Aneesh Chopra announced the launch of Text4baby, an educational program of HMHB developed through a broad public-private partnership. The mobile health service promotes maternal and child health among underserved women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmhb.org/text4baby_nationalpr.html U.S. Chief Technology Officer Announces Unprecedented Public-Private Partnership text4baby], Press Release, February 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

Text4baby is the first-ever free mobile health service in the United States. It provides scientifically-reviewed health tips, reminders and information about community resources, delivered via SMS text messages sent to the mobile phones of subscribing women. Messages are timed to the mother’s stage of pregnancy or the baby’s date of birth. Pregnant women and new mothers subscribe to the service by texting BABY to 511411. Mothers enroll in the Spanish-language Text4baby service by texting BEBE TO 511411.

In addition to HMHB, Text4baby founding partners include Voxiva, CTIA-The Wireless Foundation (whose wireless carrier members distribute the CMS text messages for free), grey healthcare group and founding corporate sponsor Johnson &amp; Johnson. Sponsors include WellPoint, Pfizer, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield. U.S. government partners include the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Defense Military Health System.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/05/07/free-text4baby-service-moms-and-moms-be-growing-fast Free Text4baby Service for Moms and Moms-to-Be is Growing up Fast], White House blog post, May 7, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation partners include BabyCenter, LLC, Danya International, Syniverse Technologies, Keynote Systems and The George Washington University. MTV Networks is a media sponsor. 

In August 2010, Text4baby won the “Secretary’s Pick” HHS Innovates Award from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  In June 2011, Text4baby won the Public Relations Society of America’s (PRSA) Best of Silver Anvil Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://text4baby.org/index.php/news/57-hhs-secretary-sebelius-announces-text4baby-as-hhsinnovates-award-winner Text4baby Announced as HHS innovates Award Winner], Press Release, August 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In October 2007, HMHB was part of a Maternal Nutrition Group made up of academics in obstetrics and nutritionists that released recommendations on seafood consumption during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmhb.org/oceanfishpr.html Experts in Obstetrics and Nutrition Unveil Seafood Consumption Recommendations During Pregnancy], Press Release, October 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This recommendation conflicted with official public health advice from EPA/FDA, due to the amount of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] found in seafood posing a risk to fetal and newborn brain development.

HMHB received a $70,000 donation from the [[National Fisheries Institute]], an industry group formed to promote eating seafood, prior to releasing this recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/news/ Something Fishy About Mothers and Fish Story]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OPCS-4''', or more formally '''OPCS Classification of Interventions and Procedures version 4''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OPCS Classification of Interventions and Procedures Version 4.7|url=http://www.tsoshop.co.uk/bookstore.asp?FO=1160007&amp;DI=639368|website=TSO Shop|publisher= UK Government|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Procedure code|procedural classification]] used by clinical coders within [[National Health Service]] (NHS) hospitals of [[National Health Service (England)|NHS England]], [[NHS Scotland]], [[NHS Wales]] and [[Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland]]. It is based on the earlier [[Office of Population Censuses and Surveys]] Classification of Surgical Operations and Procedures (4th revision),&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |title=Health and Social Care Information Centre: ''Background to OPCS-4 development'' |url=http://systems.hscic.gov.uk/data/clinicalcoding/codingstandards/opcs4/background |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and retains the OPCS abbreviation from this now defunct publication.

OPCS-4 [[Procedure code|codifies]] operations, procedures and interventions performed during [[Inpatient care|in-patient]] stays, day case surgery and some [[Outpatient|out-patient]] treatments in NHS hospitals. Though the code structure is different, as a code set, OPCS-4 is comparable to the American Medical Association's [[Current Procedural Terminology]].

As a publication, OPCS-4 is split into two volumes; a tabular list (Volume I) and an alphabetical index (Volume II).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Health and Social Care Information Centre: ''OPCS-4.7 - next version'' |url=http://systems.hscic.gov.uk/data/clinicalcoding/codingstandards/opcs4/opcs-4.7 |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; An electronic version is also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Health and Social Care Information Centre: ''OPCS-4 eVersion'' |url=http://systems.hscic.gov.uk/data/clinicalcoding/codingstandards/opcs4/eversion |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a number of supplementary publications are also used by [[Clinical coder|coding staff]].

==History==
The first NHS procedural classification was published in 1987, by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) as the ''Classification of Surgical Operations''. In 1992 the 4th revision was released as the ''OPCS Classification of Surgical Operations and Procedures (4th revision)'',&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; usually shorted to OPCS-4.2. Responsibility for the classifications used in the NHS, including OPCS-4, passed to the [[NHS Information Authority]] (NHS IA) when it formed in 1999.

By 2003, the NHS IA had realised OPCS-4.2 no longer accurately reflected many of the procedures being performed in the [[UK health care|UK healthcare system]]. As a medium term measure, a project to replace OPCS-4 with a more robust method of procedure coding was proposed and partially developed. Rather than using a sequence of codes to capture activity, the new classification would have used a single alphanumeric code up to 15 characters long. When the NHS IA was superseded by [[NHS Connecting for Health]] (NHS CFH) in 2005, the project was placed on indefinite hold, and a program of annual revisions to OPCS-4 was implemented. Much of the development work for the suspended project was reused to produce the initial expansion and enhancement of OPCS-4.2 to OPCS-4.3. However, OPCS-4.2 remained the mandated method of procedural classification in the NHS setting until March 2006.&lt;ref name="HSCIC-OPCS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Health and Social Care Information Centre: ''OPCS-4 Classification'' |url=http://systems.hscic.gov.uk/data/clinicalcoding/codingstandards/opcs4 |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the implementation of OPCS-4.3 in April 2006 there have been five further editions of OPCS-4 released. {{As of|2018|10}};  OPCS-4.9 is under development, with a provisional release date of 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Digital |first1=N. H. S. |title=Delen: Home: OPCS-4 |url=https://hscic.kahootz.com/connect.ti/t_c_home/view?objectId=297875#implementation |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each becoming the mandated classification on 1 April in the year of publication.

'''OPCS-4 version mandated for use (financial year)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NHS Data Dictionary: ''OPCS Classification of Interventions and Procedures'' |url=http://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/web_site_content/supporting_information/clinical_coding/opcs_classification_of_interventions_and_procedures.asp |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*2006-7 OPCS-4.3
*2007-9 OPCS-4.4
*2009-11 OPCS-4.5

Whilst additions to OPCS-4 are reviewed on an annual basis, the long term plan is to replace OPCS-4 with [[SNOMED CT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Department of Health – NHS Financial Reforms: ''National intervention classifications'' |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/Financeandplanning/NHSFinancialReforms/DH_4127040 |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081211205044/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/Financeandplanning/NHSFinancialReforms/DH_4127040 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-12-11 |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2013 NHS CFH ceased to exist. On 1 April 2013, the Health and Social Care Information Centre's (HSCIC) Clinical Classifications Service (CCS) became responsible for the revision and maintenance of OPCS-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Clinical Classifications Service|url=http://systems.hscic.gov.uk/data/clinicalcoding/about|website=HSCIC|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 2016, HSCIC was rebranded to [[NHS Digital]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HSCIC changing its name to NHS Digital|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hscic-changing-its-name-to-nhs-digital|accessdate=12 October 2016|date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; responsibility for OPCS-4 remains with NHS Digital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OPCS-4 Classification|url=http://systems.digital.nhs.uk/data/clinicalcoding/codingstandards/opcs4|website=NHS Digital|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Missing" chapters===

====I-codes====
There is currently no Chapter I. Nor are there any codes beginning with an "I".

====O-codes====
Whilst there is no Chapter O, codes beginning with an "O" can be found in OPCS-4. These were added to chapters when all the available 3-character code blocks were exhausted, but further classifications were needed. They are also referred to as "overflow codes", and are located at the end of the related chapter. When indexing a procedure or intervention that is classified to an O-code, the letter denoting the chapter the code is found in is given in [[parentheses]] after the code. For example: O04.- Embolisation Artery Aneurysmal Transluminal Percutaneous NEC (L).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=OPCS Classification of Interventions and Procedures Version 4.8, volume II|date=2017|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=978-0-11-323049-5|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code structure===
OPCS-4 is an alphanumeric nomenclature, and uses a four character code layout; similar to that found in [[ICD-10]]. The first character is always a letter. With the exception of the O-codes mentioned above, the letter indicates the chapter the code is from. The second, third and fourth characters are always numbers. A [[full stop]] (.) separates the third and fourth characters. Also, unlike ICD-10, there are no three character codes within OPCS-4.

Although OPCS-4 is used to classify procedures and interventions, and ICD-10 classifies diagnoses; their chapters do not correlate. That is to say; Chapter A of OPCS-4 is not used to classify treatments for conditions in Chapter I of ICD-10.

==Volume II - Alphabetical Index==
OPCS-4 Volume II is an index for looking up codes in Volume I. It is bad practice to use it by itself, as some trails only index to the 3rd character category, rather than the 4th character [[rubric]].

It is split into four numbered sections, along with an introduction section.

===Introduction===
The introduction gives a brief guide on using OPCS-4, and defines some abbreviations; for example {{em|NEC (Not Elsewhere Classified)}}.

===Section I – Alphabetical Index of Interventions and Procedures===
This is the main bulk of the index, and contains the mechanism of looking up codes within the tabular list.

Terms are indexed in a {{em|What}}, {{em|Where}}, {{em|How}} method. For example, [[oesophagogastroduodenoscopy]] is trailed via Examination (the What), Gastrointestinal Tract Upper (the Where), Endoscopic Fibreoptic (the How).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=OPCS classification of interventions and procedures, version 4.7, Volume II - Alphabetical Index|date=2014|publisher=TSO|location=London|isbn=9780113229918|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section II – Alphabetical Index of Surgical Eponyms===

This list of surgical [[eponyms]], contains common NHS procedures that may also be known by the surgeon, team or institution that developed the method or device used. For example, the Birmingham [[hip resurfacing]] and the Thompson [[Hemiarthroplasty]].

Care must be taken when using trailing via Section II for two reasons:
#The eponyms given are based on the original description, of the original procedure. If a modified version of the procedure was performed, for example a modified Akin [[osteotomy]], or if the operation has been performed in conjunction with another procedure, e.g. Akin and Scarf osteotomies, the W15.6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=OPCS classification of interventions and procedures, version 4.7 volume II|date=2014|publisher=TSO|location=London|isbn=9780113229918|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; code given in the index may not be correct.
#Only a single term is used to index the eponyms, i.e. ''Birmingham'' rather than Birmingham hip resurfacing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=OPCS classification of interventions and procedures, version 4.7 volume II|date=2014|publisher=TSO|location=London|isbn=9780113229918|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that care must be taken where the same eponym has been used more than once. For example, ''Thompson'' has four separate entries that apply to different procedures: Thompson's lymphoedema correction, cemented Thompson hemiarthroplasty, uncemented Thompson hemiarthroplasty, and Thompson's quadricepsplasty

===Section III – Alphabetical Index of Surgical Abbreviations===
This section of the Volume II contains an alphabetical list of common [[abbreviations]] and their definitions. For example, [[ECMO]] - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=OPCS classification of interventions and procedures, version 4.7.|date=2014|publisher=TSO|location=London|isbn=9780113229918|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As there are few instances where the abbreviation has been used more than once, and medical language is liable to change; descriptors are given to clarify all abbreviations. For example, SST could stand for Serum Skin Test or [[ACTH stimulation test|Short Synacthen Test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=OPCS classification of interventions and procedures, version 4.7.|date=2014|publisher=TSO|location=London|isbn=9780113229918|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section IV – Alphabetical Index of Common Surgical Suffixes===
This section of Volume II is a single page [[glossary]] that defines [[suffixes]] that are used throughout the classification. For example, -otomy.

==Supplementary publications==
There are a number of publications that supplement OPCS-4.

===Standards book===
The ''National Clinical Coding Standards OPCS-4'' is a reference book on how to use the classification, and provides guidance through examples. It is initially supplied to novice coders who attend a standards course run by a CCS approved trainer. Whilst each revision to OPCS-4 sees the issue of a new manual; any updates or corrections are issued electronically, and the onus is on the coder to update them by hand.

Prior to OPCS-4.7, and the move of maintenance responsibility to NHS Digital, the standards book was known as the ''Clinical Coding Instruction Manual''.

===The Coding Clinic===
The Coding Clinic publication is how minor changes and coding advice for both ICD-10 and OPCS-4 are disseminated through the UK clinical coding community. Initially issued as a printed newsletter, in 2012 the format was switched to a single, compendium-like electronic publication.

===High Cost Drugs List===
Maintained by the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health's]] (DH) [[Payment by Results]] team; the High Cost Drugs List is a catalogue of drugs licensed for use in the NHS that are excluded from the Payment by Results (PbR) tariff.

Issued annually - even in years with no revision to OPCS-4 - the list consists of the generic names of certain drugs next to the relevant OPCS-4 code. The guidance section of the list states that it is down to the clinical staff to use the generic instead of brand names.

===Chemotherapy Regimens List===
The Chemotherapy Regimens List, also issued by the DH Payment by Results team, is for the coding of administration of [[Chemotherapy|antineoplastic drugs]]. Organised alphabetically, the list contains adult and paediatric chemotherapy regimens used in the NHS. [[Clinical trials|Drug trials]] are excluded as they are usually financed by the trial's commissioner, for example a pharmaceutical company or cancer charity.

The National Clinical Coding Standards OPCS-4 and both of the DH lists are issued to coders via Terminology Reference Data Update Distribution Service (TRUD)[https://www.uktcregistration.nss.cfh.nhs.uk/]

==Copyright==
As an NHS publication, OPCS-4 is covered by [[Crown copyright#United Kingdom|Crown Copyright]].

'''PATH''' is an international, [[nonprofit]] global health organization based in [[Seattle]], with 1,600 employees in more than 70+ offices around the world. Its president and CEO is Steve Davis. PATH focuses on five platforms—vaccines, drugs, diagnostics, devices, and system and service innovations—to develop innovations and implement solutions that save lives and improve health, especially among women and girls.

PATH's tagline is "Better health moves humanity forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.path.org/about/|title=Better health moves humanity forward|website=www.path.org|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:PATH headquarters in Seattle.jpg|thumb|PATH headquarters in Seattle]]
Founded in 1977 with a focus on [[family planning]], PATH soon broadened its purpose to work on a wide array of emerging and persistent global health issues in the areas of health technologies, [[maternal health]], child health, [[reproductive health]], [[vaccine]]s and [[immunization]], and emerging and epidemic diseases such as [[HIV]], [[malaria]], and [[tuberculosis]].

Since 2000, PATH expanded from about 300 employees and an annual budget of $60 million to, in 2016, a payroll of 1,600 people working in 70+ countries and a budget of $305 million.

PATH is one of the largest nonprofit organizations in global health today.&lt;ref name="Seattle Post-Intelligencer"&gt;{{cite news | author = Seattle Post-Intelligencer | title = PATH, influential global health office, marks 30 years | url = http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/health/article/PATH-influential-global-health-office-marks-30-1238060.php | accessdate = February 13, 2013 | date=May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PATH's headquarters are in the [[South Lake Union, Seattle]] neighborhood, close to several other global health organizations including the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Doughton"&gt;{{cite news|last=Doughton|first=Sandi|title=The Seattle nonprofit PATH picks a new leader|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/the-seattle-nonprofit-path-picks-a-new-leader/|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institute for OneWorld Health===
'''OneWorld Health''' was a 501(c)(3) nonprofit drug development organization founded in [[San Francisco]] in 2000 by [[Victoria Hale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/feb/09/business/fi-drugs9|title=Nonprofits Work With Drug Firms to Treat Diseases in Third World|last=Elias|first=Paul|date=2004-02-09|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, OneWorld Health became a drug development program of PATH.&lt;ref name="OneWorld Health to become an affiliate of PATH"&gt;{{cite web|title=OneWorld Health to become an affiliate of PATH|url=http://www.path.org/news/press-room/203/|publisher=PATH|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was the Institute for OneWorld Health has become PATH's Drug Development program.

==PATH's work==
PATH's vision is "a world where innovation ensures that health is within reach for everyone." Its mission is "to improve the health of people around the world by advancing technologies, strengthening systems, and encouraging healthy behaviors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About PATH|url=http://www.path.org/about.php|work=PATH website|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PATH is best known for developing and adapting technologies, such as improved vaccination devices and new tools to prevent cervical cancer, to address the health needs of developing countries. It targets health problems, evaluates possible solutions, and assesses whether they would be useful in finding health solutions.&lt;ref name="Doughton"/&gt;

Steve Davis, PATH's CEO, has described the organization's role as a "bridge-builder and innovator on the global stage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Steve|title=Building bridges in a new global health landscape|url=http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2012/06/04/building-bridges-in-a-new-global-health-landscape/|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=Xconomy|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health technologies===
PATH develops, adapts, and advances technologies focused on disease diagnostics, drugs, vaccine delivery, nutrition, reproductive health, water and sanitation, and other areas.

====Vaccine and pharmaceutical technologies====
One of PATH's best-known technologies is the [[vaccine vial monitor]], a small sticker that adheres to a vaccine vial and changes color as the vaccine is exposed to heat over time. The sticker helps health workers know when a vaccine has reached its preset temperature limit and can no longer be safely used. It promotes more reliable vaccinations as well as cost savings, because health workers no longer have to throw out vaccine just because they suspect it has gone bad. [[UNICEF]] requires these monitors on all vaccines it purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WHO, UNICEF urge use of vaccine vial monitors|url=http://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/vaccine-preventable-diseases/news/print/infectious-disease-news/%7B56d61fc7-6265-4cb3-9b6e-828699c1b804%7D/who-unicef-urge-use-of-vaccine-vial-monitors|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=Infectious Disease News|date=June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another vaccine technology developed by PATH is the [[Uniject]] injection system. The single-dose, autodisabling injection system consists of a needle attached to a small bubble of plastic that is prefilled with medication. The system is designed to prevent disease transmission and enable health workers with only a little training to administer vaccine and other drugs in remote villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Health innovations in poorer countries|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/TECH/07/02/health.innovations/|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=16 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nutrition====
PATH develops nutrition-focused innovations such as [[Ultra Rice]], a manufactured, micronutrient-fortified "grain" that can be mixed with rice to fight malnutrition in countries where rice is a staple food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Timmerman|first=Luke|title=Seattle nonprofit PATH set to launch 'Ultra Rice' to fight global malnutrition|url=http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2008/08/13/ultra-rice-born-in-a-bellingham-inventors-lab-is-poised-to-go-global-with-path/|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=Xconomy|date=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Made of rice flour, micronutrients, and nutrient-protecting ingredients, Ultra Rice can mimic the look and taste of local rice and deliver the specific micronutrients a population needs. Ultra Rice has been produced and tested in several countries, including Brazil, Burundi, and India, where it has been served in school-lunch programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heim|first=Kristi|title=Ultra Rice: Whatcom County invention holds hope for health|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2012441987_ultrarice25.html|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ultra Rice: A boost for malnourished children|url=http://www.worldvision.org/news/burundi-child-malnutrition-ultra-rice-fortified|work=World Vision website|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; PATH is working with partners in Cambodia to distribute Ultra Rice through food assistance programs and deepen the evidence base for rice fortification. In Brazil, PATH has partnered with a commercial rice producer to sell Ultra Rice on supermarket shelves and reach 10 million low-income consumers in three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Urbano vai produzir ' Ultra Rice'|url=http://www.abrasnet.com.br/clipping.php?area=9&amp;clipping=26259|work=Abras|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual and reproductive health====
Several PATH technologies address sexual and reproductive health, including:
* The ''careHPV'' test, developed in conjunction with [[Qiagen]] as the first molecular diagnostic to screen for human papillomavirus (HPV)—the most common cause of cervical cancer—in clinics in low-resource settings. China's State Food and Drug Administration approved the test for sale beginning in January 2013, followed by India and other emerging markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China's SFDA approves QIAGEN careHPV Test and instrument platform|url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/20121129/Chinas-SFDA-approves-QIAGEN-careHPV-Test-and-instrument-platform.aspx|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=News Medical|date=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The test is designed specifically for use in clinics that lack reliable clean water or electricity.
*  The [[SILCS diaphragm]], a "one size fits most" contraceptive device. The device differs from traditional latex diaphragms in that it is made of silicone instead of latex, is designed to hold up to extreme temperatures and poor storage conditions common in developing countries, and will not require a doctor's fitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Future of Birth Control|url=http://healthland.time.com/2011/01/06/the-future-of-birth-control/photo/307_diaphragm/|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=TIME|date=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  The Woman's Condom, a new female condom designed to be more acceptable to both partners than other female condoms, plus easier to use, more secure, less noisy, and more comfortable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nakkazi|first=Esther|title=Coming soon: An improved, noiseless female condom|url=http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/Coming+soon++An+improved++noiseless+female+condom/-/2558/1206656/-/sqsu01z/-/|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=The East African|date=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PATH transferred production of the condom to Dahua Medical Apparatus Company in China in 2008. The condom has received regulatory approvals in China and the European Union and became commercially available in China in late 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Woman's Condom: Expanding Options for Dual Protection|url=http://www.womendeliver.org/updates/entry/womans-condom-expanding-options-for-dual-protection/|work=Women Deliver website|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PATH employs a user-driven design process for its reproductive technologies to meet women's specific needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Another Push for Reproductive Rights|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2011/06/another-push-for-reproductive-rights/|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=Inter Press Service|date=17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Water and sanitation====
PATH looks at ways to improve water quality in developing countries, including helping companies develop low-cost filters, gadgets, and other water-treatment products to stimulate a commercial market and keep prices low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taking on third world water|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2003469254_cleanwater09m.html|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=9 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaccines and immunization===
PATH is working with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to support the development of vaccines for diseases such as [[meningitis]]&lt;ref name="Coghlan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Coghlan|first=Andy|title=Cheap vaccine eradicates new cases of meningitis A|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20568-cheap-vaccine-eradicates-new-cases-of-meningitis-a.html|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=New Scientist|date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[pneumonia]] and to help countries introduce vaccines for childhood illnesses such as [[rotavirus]] and [[Japanese encephalitis]].

====Meningitis====
PATH and the [[World Health Organization]], through the Meningitis Vaccine Project, led the development of a vaccine called [[MenAfriVac]] to end meningitis A epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa, where 450 million people in 26 countries are at risk of the disease. The vaccine was developed by [[Serum Institute of India]] and introduced in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger in December 2010 to prevent the spread of a strain of meningitis found only in Africa. Within six months, the vaccine eliminated new cases of meningitis A in the areas where it was introduced.&lt;ref name="Coghlan"/&gt;   By the end of 2012, the vaccine had reached 100 million people in ten countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Africa: 100 Millionth Person Receives Lifesaving Meningitis Vaccine|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201212040882.html|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=All Africa|date=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The introduction of MenAfriVac marked the first time that a vaccine was developed for a disease only found in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richard|first=Besser|title=Dr. Besser's Notebook: New Meningitis Shot Protects Hearing in Africa's Children|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/GlobalHealth/dr-bessers-notebook-shot-save-hearing/story?id=13080818|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=ABC News|date=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously used meningitis vaccines had low efficacy and cost USD $80 per dose. The new vaccine has high efficacy against the type of meningitis that is most prevalent in Africa and costs less than $0.50 per dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Talea|title=New Meningitis Vaccine Could be Model for Future Drugs|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2010/12/new-meningitis-vaccine-could-be-model-for-future-drugs.html|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=PBS News Hour|date=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The entire vaccination research and development project cost less than US$100 million, about one-fifth the typical cost for developing a vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knox|first=Richard|title=Africa's Meningitis Belt Gets First Vaccine Designed For Poor Nations|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2010/12/06/131853635/africa-s-meningitis-belt-gets-first-vaccine-designed-for-poor-nations|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=NPR|date=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, MenAfriVac was also approved for storage without refrigeration for up to four days, enabling health workers to more easily reach patients in rural villages or in areas with no power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McNeil|first=Donald|title=Africa: A Change in Guidelines Could Extend a Vaccine's Reach in 'Meningitis Belt'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/20/health/meningitis-vaccine-gets-window-without-refrigeration.html?_r=0|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rotavirus====
PATH supports the introduction of vaccines against rotavirus in developing countries to protect young children from severe diarrhea. In 2006, PATH helped Nicaragua become the first developing country to introduce rotavirus vaccines within months of their introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parry|first=Jane|title=New vaccines to boost child care in developing countries|journal=World Health Organization Bulletin|date=June 2007|volume=85|issue=6|doi=10.2471/BLT.07.020607|pmid=17639237|pmc=2636349}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Former PATH researcher John Wecker noted that rotavirus infections dropped in areas that began to use the vaccine after the WHO recommended its international use in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelland|first=Kate|title=Studies show swift impact of rotavirus vaccines|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/20/us-rotavirus-vaccines-idUSTRE70J5MB20110120|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PATH also conducts research to show the impact of rotavirus vaccines and help countries choose whether to adopt the vaccines into their immunization programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Maggie|title=Diarrhea vaccines could save 2 million lives: report|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/01/27/us-diarrhea-vaccines-idUSTRE60Q6Q420100127|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japanese encephalitis====
PATH is working with India and other countries in the region to introduce an affordable vaccine to protect against [[Japanese encephalitis]]—a disease the World Health Organization estimates claims 10,000 to 15,000 lives a year, mostly children, and causes permanent brain damage in many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mason|first=Margie|title=India Launches Encephalitis Vaccination|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/26/AR2006072600249.html|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=26 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, PATH helped the government of India launch an immunization campaign to reach millions of children in high-risk areas with the vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Immunisation drive against Japanese encephalitis|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/07/26/stories/2006072609171300.htm|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=26 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PATH has also supported successful immunization campaigns in Cambodia, North Korea, and other countries to reach more than 60 million children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestones: Japanese encephalitis vaccine|url=http://www.path.org/blog/2012/08/milestones-japanese-encephalitis-vaccine/|work=PATH blog|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epidemic diseases===
Part of PATH's work focuses on some of the most widespread and threatening global diseases: malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and influenza.

====Malaria====
The PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative supports several malaria vaccine candidates at various stages of development around the world, including the most advanced candidate, called [[RTS,S]]. Researchers are studying RTS,S, made by [[GlaxoSmithKline]], in phase 3 clinical trials among infants and young children in sub-Saharan Africa. Interim results of the study released in 2011 showed the vaccine provided about 50 percent protection against [[malaria]] for young children ages 5 to 17 months. Interim study results released in 2012 showed RTS,S reduced cases of malaria among infants by 33 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=David|title=Tests find malaria vaccine useful|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/tests-find-malaria-vaccine-useful/2012/11/08/013613f4-29e5-11e2-bab2-eda299503684_story.html|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, GlaxoSmithKline reported that the experimental vaccine reduced the amount of cases amongst young children by almost 50 percent and among infants by around 25 percent, following the conclusion of an 18-month clinical trial.  GlaxoSmithKline is set to submit an application for a marketing license with the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) in 2014.  The new vaccine has the backing of the UN's Swiss-based [[WHO]] which states that it will recommend the use of RTS,S for use starting in 2015, providing it gets approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GSK aims to market world's first malaria vaccine|author=Kelland, Kate|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/07/us-malaria-vaccine-gsk-idUSBRE9960Y320131007|newspaper=Reuters|date=7 October 2013|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another PATH initiative to address malaria is the Malaria Control and Evaluation Partnership in Africa (MACEPA), which focuses on controlling malaria through the use of insecticide-treated bednets, indoor spraying of insecticides, new diagnostic tools to find infection, and effective medicines for treatment.&lt;ref name="Bauman all"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bauman|first=Valerie|title=PATH leader: Fight against malaria making progress|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2012/11/21/path-leader-discusses-breakthroughs-in.html?page=all|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=Puget Sound Business Journal|date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Zambia, this work has helped decrease the rate of malaria among children younger than age 5 by 50 percent in two years.&lt;ref name="Bauman all"/&gt;

In December 2012, PATH received an award from the US [[President's Malaria Initiative]] for a new malaria project focused on "the expansion of high-quality diagnosis and treatment for malaria and other childhood illnesses and infectious diseases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Malaria Diagnosis and Treatment Project Awarded: MalariaCare|url=http://www.pmi.gov/news/pressreleases/malaria_care.html|work=PMI Website|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PATH's Drug Development program, which grew out of an affiliation with [[OneWorld Health]], is advancing a new, semisynthetic form of the malaria drug [[artemisinin]] that will bolster the current, volatile botanical supply.&lt;ref name="From ancient China to a modern lab"&gt;{{cite web|last=PATH|title=From ancient China to a modern lab|url=http://www.path.org/projects/artemisinin.php|publisher=PATH|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Talea|title=Bio-Tech Breakthrough Could End Malaria Drug Shortages|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2011/10/bio-tech-breakthrough-could-end-malaria-drug-shortages.html|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=PBS News Hour|date=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2014, PATH and Sanofi announced the release of the first batch of semisynthetic artemisinin.  1.7 million doses of Sanofi's ArteSunate AmodiaQuine Winthrop (ASAQ Winthrop), a fixed-dose artemisinin-based combination therapy will be shipped to half a dozen African countries over the next few months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercepharmamanufacturing.com/story/sanofi-shipping-new-malaria-treatment-manufactured-semisynthetic-artemisini/2014-08-19|title=Sanofi shipping new malaria treatment manufactured from 'semisynthetic artemisinin'|author=Palmer, Eric|publisher=fiercepharmamanufacturing.com|date=19 August 2014|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====HIV====
PATH works in Africa, Asia, and other regions to slow the spread of HIV/AIDS and provide support for people affected by the disease. In Kenya, where PATH has worked for more than 20 years, the organization conducts research into "multipurpose prevention technologies" that can protect women from HIV and pregnancy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mwololo|first=Millicent|title=Kenya: The Power to Protect and to Plan|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201111300091.html|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=All Africa|date=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and provides support groups and health services for married adolescents and other groups at high risk for HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KENYA: HIV prevention for married adolescents|url=http://www.plusnews.org/Report/90775/KENYA-HIV-prevention-for-married-adolescents|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=IRIN/Plus News|date=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also leads a large project with local governments and community organizations to strengthen and expand services for HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and maternal and newborn health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=APHIAplus–Western Kenya|url=http://kenya.usaid.gov/programs/health/1207|work=USAID Kenya website|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other PATH projects to address HIV in Africa include improving access to HIV treatment and services in Ethiopia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PATH secures major HIV/AIDS grants|url=http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/philanthropy/2009/04/23/path_secures_two_major_hivaids.html|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and expanding HIV counseling and testing and other services in the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;ref name="Davidow"&gt;{{cite news|last=Davidow|first=Julie|title=Street theater aims to get folks talking about health issues|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/health/article/Street-theater-aims-to-get-folks-talking-about-1174185.php?searchpagefrom=1&amp;searchdiff=1|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=23 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PATH uses [[behavior change communication]] techniques to encourage healthy behaviors for HIV prevention. One of the best-known examples is PATH's work with "magnet theater" in Kenya, India, Vietnam, and other developing countries. Named because of its natural pulling power, this interactive street theater draws people in rural communities to clearings, dirt roads, and village centers—any open space where people can gather. There, actors banter with their audiences and pull them into the play, stimulating dialogue about HIV/AIDS and other taboo subjects and helping individuals re-examine behaviors that contribute to poor health.&lt;ref name="Davidow"/&gt;

===Maternal and child health===
In addition to its work on vaccines for childhood illnesses, PATH addresses pregnancy complications, nutrition issues, and other health challenges that affect women and children in developing countries and lead to higher rates of illness and death.

In 2012, PATH completed a seven-year project in [[India]] focused on safe birth for mothers and babies. PATH worked with local governments and community groups to encourage community leaders, health workers, pregnant women, and families to deliver babies in health centers, rather than at home, and adopt other best practices to protect mothers and their infants during pregnancy, childbirth, and infancy. The project used community outreach approaches including door-to-door [[clinical surveillance]], distribution of printed health materials, and [[street theater]] to spread messages about maternal and newborn health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vrinda|first=Malik|title=The snowball effect|url=http://www.thehindu.com/health/policy-and-issues/article3355961.ece|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[South Africa]], PATH leads a five-year project to improve the health and development of 750,000 pregnant women and children by encouraging [[breastfeeding]] and improving health care for pregnant women and young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SA maternal and child death unacceptably high|url=http://news.howzit.msn.com/sa-maternal-and-child-death-unacceptably-high|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=MSN South Africa News|date=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Where PATH works==
Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, PATH has more than 70 offices in countries around the world. As of December 2012, these countries included Belgium, Cambodia, China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, France, Ghana, India, Kenya, Mozambique, Peru, Senegal, South Africa, Switzerland, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, Ukraine, United States, Vietnam, and Zambia.

PATH currently works in more than 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our global presence|url=http://www.path.org/our-work/our-global-presence.php|work=PATH website|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding and expenses==
PATH's expenses in 2011 were US$284 million, of which more than 40 percent was spent on vaccines and immunization programs and 26 percent spent on emerging and epidemic diseases.&lt;ref name="PATH Finances"&gt;{{cite web|title=PATH Finances|url=http://www.path.org/about/finances.php|work=PATH website|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PATH receives funding from foundations, the US government, other governments, nongovernmental organizations, multilateral agencies, and individuals. PATH's budget for 2012 was US $305 million.&lt;ref name="PATH Finances"/&gt;

In 2010, PATH received the most US foundation grants in the state of Washington and ranked thirteenth among international recipients of US foundation grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 50 recipients of foundation grants in the state of Washington, circa 2010|url=http://foundationcenter.org/findfunders/statistics/pdf/04_fund_sub/2010/50_recp_sub/r_sub_e_10.pdf|work=The Foundation Center|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charity Navigator]], America's largest independent evaluator of nonprofits, has awarded PATH its highest rating, four stars, for sound fiscal management for nine consecutive years.&lt;ref name="Charity Navigator Directory"&gt;{{cite web | author = Charity Navigator Directory | title = PATH | url = https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=17560| accessdate = February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In 2012, the NGO was warned by the Indian government after one of its studies involving an HPV vaccine resulted in the alleged death of seven girls belonging to an indigenous community (tribe) in India.&lt;ref name="The Hindu"&gt;{{cite news|last=The|first=Hindu|title=Hindu report on HPV trials|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3817639.ece|accessdate=24 February 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In what [[The Hindu]] called "a shockingly unethical trial",  nearly 2,800 consent forms were signed by a hostel warden or headmaster, as the 'guardian'.&lt;ref name="The group"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Hindu Editorial|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/article2021657.ece|accessdate=24 February 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2012, PATH was ranked as the sixth best NGO in the world on the "top 100" list published by [[The Global Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Top 100 NGOs 2012|url=http://theglobaljournal.net/top100NGOs/|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=The Global Journal|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, PATH received the [[Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Conrad N.

The '''Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans''', published by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), provides [[physical activity]] recommendations for people aged 6 and older and for all physical conditions.  The [[science]]-based Guidelines recommend a total amount of physical activity per week to achieve a range of health benefits.

These Guidelines can be tailored to meet individual interests, lifestyles, and goals. Recommendations in the Guidelines can be incorporated within daily routines and allow activities—like walking, biking, or dancing—to be integrated.

The main message is that regular physical activity over months and years can produce long-term [[health]] benefits and reduce the risk of many diseases.  The messages from the Physical Activity Guidelines are also found in the [[Dietary Guidelines for Americans]] which provide recommendations for healthy food choices and regular physical activity.

Health professionals and policymakers are the primary audiences for the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. However, the information is useful for anyone interested in improving the health of his/her community members and other individuals.

== History ==
The [http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/ Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans] were released on October 7, 2008 and are based on a comprehensive review of scientific research about physical activity and health.

The US Department of Health and Human Services released an update to its Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans in 2018, a decade after publishing its first set of guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans - 2nd Edition |url=https://health.gov/paguidelines/second-edition/pdf/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf |website=health.gov |publisher=Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2018 report linked the lack of physical activity to about $117 billion in annual healthcare costs and about 10% of premature mortality.

While the 2008 edition gave recommendations for children from age 6 years onward, the 2018 edition includes guidelines even for preschool children, from ages 3 through 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=D’Onofrio |first1=Kaitlyn |title=HHS Issues Physical Activity Guidelines |url=https://www.docwirenews.com/docwire-pick/hhs-physical-activity-guidelines/ |website=DocWire News |accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health benefits of regular physical activity ==
*Health benefits of regular physical activity occur for children and adolescents, young and middle-aged adults, older adults, and those in every racial and ethnic group.  There are also benefits for people who have disabilities.
*Both aerobic (endurance) and muscle-strengthening (resistance) physical activities are beneficial.  Bone strengthening activities are also important for children and adolescents.  
*The benefits of physical activity far outweigh the possibility of adverse outcomes. 
*Regular physical activity is one of the most important things you can do for your health. It can help:
# Control your weight
# Reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease
# Reduce your risk for type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome
# Reduce your risk of some cancers
# Strengthen your bones and muscles
# Improve your mental health and mood
# Improve your ability to do daily activities and prevent falls, if you're an older adult
# Increase your chances of living longer&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/health/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Association for the Education of Young Children suggests that children who get appropriate unstructured physical activity will reduce their stress; also studies show that stress plays a major role in learning and in health (“Recess Rocks”). Many children benefit from physical activities which help with bullying and better eating habits. Physical activities are important in children because it helps them stay focused in the classroom, improve brain function and overall behavior.
&lt;http://www.coloradoinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Recess-Rocks.pdf&gt;

== Key recommendations for adults ==

=== Aerobic (endurance) exercise recommendations ===
* Most benefits occur with at least '''2 hours and 30 minutes''' (150 minutes) a week of '''moderate-intensity''' aerobic physical activity.
:* Moderate activities are those such as ballroom and line dancing, biking on level ground or with a few hills, general gardening, walking briskly, and water aerobics. 
* If you choose to do '''vigorous-intensity''' aerobic activities, do at least '''1 hour and 15 minutes''' a week.
:* Vigorous activities take more effort than moderate activities.  
:* Vigorous activities are those such as aerobic dance, biking faster than 10 miles per hour, heavy gardening, race walking, jogging, or running, and swimming fast or swimming laps.
* It is beneficial to do at least 10 minutes of an activity at a time. 
* Additional benefits occur with more physical activity (higher intensity, greater frequency, and/or longer duration).
* Some physical activity is better than none!

=== Muscle strengthening (resistance) exercise recommendations ===
* It is beneficial to do muscle strengthening (resistance) activities at least '''2 days a week'''. 
:* Resistance activities should include all of the major muscle groups, such as legs, hips, back, chest, stomach, shoulders, and arms.

===Exercise recommendations for the elderly ===
* Elderly exercise aids in compressing morbidity.  
:*  As adults grow older, emphasis should be placed on fitness in order to maintain health, independence and functionality as opposed to aerobic fitness.  When designing an exercise program for older adults, a gentle warm up will be crucial in preventing exercise-induced injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzeo, R. S., &amp; Tanaka, H. (2001, August). Exercise prescription for the elderly: Current recommendations. Sports Medicine,31(11), 809-818.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:* It is also recommended that older adults exercise at low or moderate intensity for longer periods of time rather than vigorous intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Pate RR, Pratt M, Blair SN, et al. Physical activity and public health: a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine. JAMA 1995; 273 (5): 402-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key recommendations for children and adolescents ==

=== Aerobic (endurance) exercise recommendations ===
* Most benefits occur with at least '''60 minutes''' (1 hour) or more daily of '''moderate- or vigorous-intensity''' aerobic physical activity.
:* Moderate activities are those such as riding a bike, brisk walking, and games that require catching and throwing.
:* Vigorous activities are those such as running, sports such as soccer, ice or field hockey, basketball, swimming, or tennis, and active games requiring running and chasing, such as tag or flag football.

=== Muscle strengthening (resistance) exercise recommendations ===
* Muscle strengthening activities should be done at least '''3 days a week''' as part of the 60 minutes of daily exercise recommended for children and adolescents. 
:* Muscle strengthening activities are games such as tug-of-war, resistance exercises using bands, body weight, or hand held weights, climbing a rope, tree, or wall, and doing sit-ups.

=== Bone strengthening exercise recommendations ===
* Bone strengthening activities should be done at least '''3 days a week''' as part of the 60 minutes of daily exercise recommended for children and adolescents. 
:* Bone strengthening activities are games that involved hopping, skipping or jumping, and running.

==Fundamental Movement Skills ==
Related to the U.S. Department of Health and Senior Service's Guidelines for Americans are Fundamental Movement Skills. As defined by the Department of Education:

“fundamental movement skills are movement patterns that involve different body parts such as the legs, arms, trunk and head, and include such skills as running, hopping,catching, throwing, striking, and balancing. They are the foundation movements or precursor patterns to the more specialized, complex skills used in play,games, sports, dance, gymnastics, outdoor education and physical recreation activities&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Department of Education. (2013). Fundamental movement skills: Book 1- learning, teaching and assessment. Retrieved from http://det.wa.edu.au/stepsresources/detcms/navigation/fundamental-movement-skills/&lt;/ref&gt;”

Fundamental movement skills are broken up into three categories, including body management skills, loco motor skills, and object control skills.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Body Management Skills are those that involve balancing the body in motion and stillness, and are accomplished through moves such as climbing, rolling, twisting, turning and stopping.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Loco motor Skills refer to movements that transport the body from one place to another. These include galloping, crawling,running, hopping and skipping.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Object Control Skills involve controlling objects with the hands or feet. Such moves would include throwing, bouncing,dribbling, and catching.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Impact on Development===
These skill sets are dubbed fundamental because they are crucial to many aspects of development. Physical development is a more obvious positive outcome from learning these skills, but perhaps less considered outcomes are social and mental development. 
* Social Development: Children who are capable of performing these moves find it easier to participate in games and are more likely to do so.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They have greater confidence in themselves, higher self-esteem, and are more likely to be viewed as popular playmates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Mental Development: Many children can demonstrate learning through movement better than they could through the more traditional means of writing or drawing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Physical activity, in general, has been shown to increase academic performance by bettering concentration and attentiveness, as well as improving attitudes towards school.&lt;ref&gt;Centers forDisease Control and Prevention. (2013, February 19). Adolescent and schoolhealth: Physical activity facts. Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/physicalactivity/facts.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physical Development: Children who foster these movements are more likely to adopt healthful habits, such as regular physical activity, and improve muscle and bone development.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The benefits of physical activity seem endless; however, they are unrecognized by many.

'''Plains game''' is well established in literature and conversation as the sporting hunter's generic term for all those fair-game species of [[antelope]] and [[gazelle]] which are to be found - typically in rather open [[plain]]s or [[savanna]] [[habitat]]s - throughout [[sub-Saharan Africa]].  The term is all-embracing, unscientific, and rather imprecise. [[Impala]] and [[Thomson's gazelle]] are classic examples of '''plains game''', but the term also encompasses a great range of species from the diminutive [[steenbok]] to the massive [[Taurotragus|eland]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Plains game species are distinct from species of dangerous game, which generally consists of the [[Big five game|Big 5]] as well as [[crocodile]] and [[hippopotamus]]. For this reason, virtually any species of game in Africa that is not considered dangerous game may be broadly referred to as '''plains game'''.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Where the term "plains game" is used as an indication of the kind of game for which particular [[rifle|sporting rifle]] [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]s are deemed suitable, it is fair to assume that the same ammunition also performs efficiently on other [[ungulate]]s occurring elsewhere in the world, such as [[deer]].

[[File:Cedric Robinson.jpg|thumb|Cedric Robinson, the Queen's Guide to the Sands, leading a group across Morecambe Bay in July 2014]]
The '''Queen's Guide to the Sands''' is the royally appointed guide to crossing the sands of [[Morecambe Bay]], an ancient and potentially dangerous tidal crossing in northwest England. {{As of|2015}}, the Guide is '''Cedric Robinson''' [[MBE]], who became the 25th guide in 1963. The guide is paid a nominal salary of only £15 a year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24321540 |title=Morecambe Bay's Queen's Guide to the Sands on why he loves his job |date=29 September 2013 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the holder of the post also has the use of the 700-year-old Guide's Cottage at [[Kents Bank]], which is owned by the Crown and managed by the [[Duchy of Lancaster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duchyoflancaster.org.uk/output/page27.asp The Duchy of Lancaster - Lancashire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103140843/http://www.duchyoflancaster.org.uk/output/page27.asp |date=3 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first official guide was appointed by the Duchy of Lancaster on 29 January 1548, a Thomas Hogeson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peter|first=David|title='Cross Kent Sands|year=1985|publisher=Lunesdale Publishing Group Limited|isbn=094609103X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the building of the [[Furness Line|railway]] in 1857, the cross sands route had been a major transport route in the area, with Guides appointed royally since the 16th century. Before that, the monks of [[Furness]] at [[Cartmel Priory]] had provided guides for crossing the sands. In modern times a crossing of the sands has become a popular challenge walk for charity fundraisers, with Robinson often leading groups of up to 500 people. These walks are typically once a fortnight (from spring to autumn), from either [[Hest Bank]] or [[Arnside]] over to [[Flookburgh|Flookburgh Point]] or [[Kents Bank]]—tide and river levels (the [[River Kent]] has to be crossed at some point) allowing—and are often in support of a charity.

The '''Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland''' ('''RPII'''), ''An Institiúid Éireannach um Chosaint Raideolaíoch'', was an independent public body in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] under the aegis of the [[Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment]]. The RPII was established in 1992 under the Radiological Protection Act 1991, which conferred on the RPII a broad remit in relation to radiological protection in Ireland. The RPII was merged with the [[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)|Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]] in August 2014, as part of the Irish Government's Public Sector Reform Plan. RPII's functions are now carried out by the Office of Radiation Protection and Environmental Monitoring within the EPA.

The general functions of the ORP are:
:*To provide advice to the Government, the [[Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government]] and other Ministers on matters relating to [[Radiation protection|radiological safety]].
:*To provide information to the public on any matters relating to radiological safety which the ORP deems fit.
:*To maintain and develop a national laboratory for the measurement of levels of [[Background radiation|radioactivity in the environment]], and to assess the significance of these levels for the Irish population.
:*To provide a personnel [[dosimetry]] and instrument calibration service for those who work with [[ionising radiation]].
:*To control by licence the custody, use, manufacture, importation, transportation, distribution, exportation and disposal of [[Radioactive source#Dangers of radioactive substances|radioactive substances]], irradiating apparatus and other sources of ionising radiation.
:*To assist in the development of [[Nuclear accident analysis|national plans]] for emergencies arising from nuclear accidents and to act in support of such plans.
:*To provide a radioactivity measurement and certification service.
:*To prepare codes and regulations for the safe use of ionising radiation.
:*To carry out and promote research in relevant fields.
:*To monitor developments abroad relating to nuclear installations and radiological safety generally, and to keep the Government informed of their implications for Ireland.
:*To co-operate with the relevant authorities in other states and with appropriate international organisations.
:*To represent the State on international bodies.
:*To be the competent authority under international conventions on nuclear matters.

The RPII was the successor to the [[Nuclear Energy Board]] which was formally wound up by the Radiological Protection Act 1991.

'''Roy F. Baumeister''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aʊ|m|aɪ|s|t|ər}}; born May 16, 1953) is a social psychologist who is known for his work on the [[self (psychology)|self]], [[social rejection]], belongingness, sexuality and sex differences, self-control, [[self-esteem]], self-defeating behaviors, motivation, aggression, consciousness, and [[free will]].

== Education and academia ==
Baumeister earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] from [[Princeton University]] and his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] from [[Duke University]]. He returned to [[Princeton University]] with his mentor [[Edward E. Jones]] and earned his [[Ph.D.]] from the university's [[Princeton University Department of Psychology|Department of Psychology]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psy.fsu.edu/faculty/baumeisterr/baumeister.dp.php|publisher=Florida State University|title = People Directory |accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/faculty-profile/roy-f-baumeister-phd|publisher=UPenn|title =  Roy F. Baumeister, Ph.D. |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baumeister then taught at [[Case Western Reserve University]] from 1979 to 2003, serving as a professor of psychology and later liberal arts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fsu.edu/cvdb/RBAUMEISTER.rtf|title=Curriculum Vitae Roy F.

He is a fellow of both the [[Society for Personality and Social Psychology]] and the [[Association for Psychological Science]]. Baumeister was named an [[ISI highly cited researcher]] in 2003 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rufener|first1=Brenda|title=30 MOST INFLUENTIAL COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGISTS ALIVE TODAY|url=http://www.bestcounselingdegrees.net/30-most-influential-counseling-psychologists-alive-today/|website=Best Counseling Degrees|publisher=Best Counseling Degrees|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics of research==
Baumeister has researched social psychology for over four decades and made a name for himself with his laboratory research. His research focuses on six themes: self control, decision-making, the need to belong and interpersonal rejection, human sexuality, irrational and self-destructive behavior, and free will.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.roybaumeister.com/research/|title=Research|website=Roy F. Baumeister|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The self===
Baumeister has conducted research on the [[self (psychology)|self]], focussing on various concepts related to how people perceive, act, and relate to their selves. Baumeister wrote a chapter titled, "The Self" in ''The Handbook of Social Psychology'',&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = [...] there may be isolated individuals who combine low self-esteem with irrational, self-destructive, or other pathological signs. Sampling techniques that aggressively seek out extremes of self-regard may indeed find enough pathological individuals to yield unusual results and confirm some of the more unsavory impressions and hypotheses about low self-esteem. For the most part, however, low self-esteem is not marked by those patterns. People with low self-esteem can be well understood as ordinary people who are trying in a fairly sensible, rational fashion to adapt effectively to their circumstances and to make their way through life with a minimum of suffering, distress, and humiliation. In that, of course, they are no different from people with high self-esteem.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irrationality and self-defeating behavior===
In a series of journal articles and books, Baumeister inquired about the reasons for self-defeating behavior. His conclusions: there is no self-defeating urge (as some have thought). Rather, self-defeating behavior is either a result of trade-offs (enjoying drugs now at the expense of the future), backfiring strategies (eating a snack to reduce stress only to feel more stressed), or a psychological strategy to escape the self&amp;nbsp;– where various self-defeating strategies are rather directed to relieve the burden of selfhood.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister R. (1991) ''Escaping the Self: Alcoholism, Spirituality, Masochism, and Other Flights from the Burden of Selfhood''. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Need to Belong''===
Baumeister wrote a paper on the [[belongingness|need-to-belong]] theory with [[Mark Leary]] in 1995. This theory seeks to show that humans have a natural need to belong with others. Baumeister and Leary suggest that human beings naturally push to form relationships.&lt;ref name = " Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995" &gt;Baumeister, R. F., &amp; Leary, M. R. (1995). The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation. ''Psychological Bulletin, 117(3)'', 497-529. doi: 10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.497.&lt;/ref&gt; This push helps to distinguish a need (rather than a desire). In addition to the drive for attachment, people also struggle to avoid the disintegration of these relationships.&lt;ref name = " Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995" /&gt; As part of this theory, a lack of belonging would have a long-term, negative impact on mood and health, and those who do not meet their belonging needs may suffer from behavioral and psychological issues.&lt;ref name = " Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995" /&gt;
Need-to-belong theory has two necessary parts:&lt;ref name = " Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995" /&gt;

# There is frequent contact between the people involved in the attachment that is typically conflict-free.
# The notion of an ongoing and continued relationship between them is essential.

This work was groundbreaking in that it separated itself from previous theories relating to [[Attachment theory|attachment]] such as those of [[John Bowlby]]. While Bowlby's theory implied the attachment needs to be applied to a group [[leader]] or authority figure,&lt;ref name =  "Bowlby, 1969" &gt;Bowlby, J. (1969). Attachment and loss: Vol. 1. Attachment. New York:Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Baumeister and Leary's need-to-belong theory posited that the relationship could be with anyone.&lt;ref name = " Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995" /&gt;  To further distinguish the two theories, Baumeister and Leary theorized that if a relationship dissolved, the bond can often be replaced with a bond to another person.&lt;ref name = " Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995" /&gt;

Later, Baumeister published evidence that the way people look for [[belongingness]] differs between men and women. Women prefer a few close and intimate relationships, whereas men prefer many but shallower connections. Men realize more of their need to belong via a group of people, or a cause, rather than in close interpersonal relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= 
What do men want? Gender differences and two spheres of belongingness: Comment on Cross and Madson (1997).|url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/122/1/38/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self regulation===
Baumeister also researched self-regulation. He coined the term "[[ego depletion]]" to describe the evidence that humans' ability to self-regulate is limited, and after using it there is less ability (or energy) to self-regulate.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R. F., Bratslavsky, E., Muraven, M., &amp; Tice, D. M. (1998). Ego depletion: Is the active self a limited resource? Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74(5), 1252-1265.&lt;/ref&gt; Ego depletion has a general effect, such that exerting self-control in one area will use up energy for further regulation in other areas of life.&lt;ref&gt;Vohs, K., Baumeister, R., Schmeichel, B., Twenge, J., Nelson, N., &amp; Tice, D. (2008). Making choices impairs subsequent self-control: A limited-resource account of decision making, self-regulation, and active initiative. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 94(5), 883-898&lt;/ref&gt; Further research by Baumeister and colleagues has led to the development of the Strength Model of self-control, which likens this ego depletion to the tiredness that comes from physically exerting a muscle. A corollary to this analogy, supported by his research, is that self-control can be strengthened over time, much like a muscle.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R. F., Vohs, K. D., &amp; Tice, D. M. (2007). The strength model of self-control. Current Directions In Psychological Science, 16(6), 351-355&lt;/ref&gt; The energy used up is more than metaphorical, however; his research has found a strong link between ego depletion and depletion of blood-glucose levels.&lt;ref&gt;Gailliot, M., Baumeister, R., DeWall, C., Maner, J., Plant, E., Tice, D., &amp; Schmeichel, B. (2007). Self-control relies on glucose as a limited energy source: Willpower is more than a metaphor. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 92(2), 325-336.&lt;/ref&gt; Baumeister also edited two academic books on self-regulation, ''Losing Control'' and ''Handbook of Self-Regulation'', and has devoted numerous experiments and journal papers to the topic. He also describes this research in a book, ''Willpower'', authored with former New York Times journalist John Tierney.

In 2016 a large study carried out at two-dozen labs in countries across the world that sought to reproduce the effects described in these studies was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/cover_story/2016/03/ego_depletion_an_influential_theory_in_psychology_may_have_just_been_debunked.html?wpsrc=sh_all_dt_tw_top|title= Everything Is Crumbling|last= Engber|first= Daniel|date= 2016-03-06|newspaper= Slate|language= en-US|issn= 1091-2339|access-date= 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baumeister, however disputed the protocol used in this replication. Baumeister also plans to run his own pre-registered replication using a protocol that is more in line with most ego-depletion experiments &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url= http://www.psychologicalscience.org/redesign/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RRR-comment-BaumeisterVohs-revised-March17-002.pdf|title= Misguided Effort with Elusive Implications - Association for Psychological Science|website= www.psychologicalscience.org|access-date= 2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture and human sexuality===
A series of studies of human sexuality has addressed questions such as how nature and culture influence people's sex drive, rape and sexual coercion, the cultural suppression of female sexuality, and how couples negotiate their sexual patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/baumeister.dp.html|title=Roy Baumeister's page, Florida State University|publisher=www.psy.fsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his research, Baumeister reached four major conclusions:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The relative influence of culture and nature on sexuality varied by gender. Female sexuality is more cultural, and male sexuality is more natural (see [[erotic plasticity]]).
# There is a gender difference with sex drive. Men, on average, want more sex than women. 
# The present widespread cultural suppression of female sexuality exists in large part at the behest of women.
# Sexual interactions can be analyzed in terms of cost-benefit analysis and market dynamics with "sexual economics."

===Free will===
Baumeister approaches the topic of [[free will]] from the view-point of [[evolutionary psychology]]. He has listed the major aspects that make up free will as self-control, rational, intelligent choice, planful behavior, and autonomous initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, T. F., Baumeister, R. F., &amp; Mele, A. R. (2011). Free will in everyday life: Autobiographical accounts of free and unfree actions. Philosophical Psychology, 24(3), 381-394&lt;/ref&gt; Baumeister proposes that "the defining thrust of human psychological evolution was selection in favor of cultural capability" &lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R. (2008). Free will in scientific psychology. Perspectives On Psychological Science, 3(1), 14-19.&lt;/ref&gt; and that these four psychological capabilities evolved to help humans function in the context of culture. In his view, free will is an advanced form of action control that allows humans to act in pro-social ways towards their [[enlightened self-interest]] when acting in these ways would otherwise be in conflict with the fulfillment of evolutionarily older drives or instincts.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R. F., Crescioni, A., &amp; Alquist, J. L. (2011). Free will as advanced action control for human social life and culture. Neuroethics, 4(1), 1-11&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Baumeister and colleagues (principally Kathleen Vohs) has shown that disbelief in free will can lead people to act in ways that are harmful to themselves and society, such as cheating on a test, increased aggression, decreased helpfulness, lower achievement levels in the workplace, and possible barriers to beating addiction.&lt;ref&gt;Vohs, K. D., &amp; Schooler, J. W. (2008). The value of believing in free will: Encouraging a belief in determinism increases cheating. Psychological Science, 19(1), 49-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R. F., Masicampo, E. J., &amp; DeWall, C. (2009). Prosocial benefits of feeling free: Disbelief in free will increases aggression and reduces helpfulness. Personality And Social Psychology Bulletin, 35(2), 260-268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, T. F., Baumeister, R. F., Vohs, K. D., Lambert, N. M., Fincham, F. D., &amp; Brewer, L. E. (2010). Personal philosophy and personnel achievement: Belief in free will predicts better job performance. Social Psychological And Personality Science, 1(1), 43-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vohs, K. D., &amp; Baumeister, R. F. (2009). Addiction and free will. Addiction Research &amp; Theory, 17(3), 231-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erotic plasticity===
Baumeister coined the term "[[erotic plasticity]]", which is the extent to which one's sex drive can be shaped by cultural, social and situational factors.&lt;ref&gt;
Baumeister, R. F. (2000). Gender Differences in Erotic Plasticity: The Female Sex Drive as Socially Flexible and Responsive. ''Psychological Bulletin, 126''(3), 347-374
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R. F. (2004). Gender and erotic plasticity: sociocultural influences on the sex drive. ''Sexual and Relationship Therapy, 19''(2), 1468-1479&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that women have high plasticity, meaning that their sex drive can more easily change in response to external pressures. On the other hand, men have low plasticity, and therefore have sex drives that are relatively inflexible.

==Works==
Baumeister has written or edited some 30 books, over 500 publications, and has been cited nearly 100,000 times in research literature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, he authors the column ''Cultural Animal'' for ''Psychology Today''. The following is a partial listing of his works.

The '''Smoke Free Illinois Act''' ({{ILCS|410|82}}; Public Act 095-0017) is a comprehensive [[Anti-smoking legislation|anti-smoking law]] that took effect in [[Illinois]] on {{start date|2008|1|1}}, and bans smoking inside most buildings and vehicles used by the general public, used as a place of employment, or owned by the government or other [[public body]]. It also requires "no-smoking" signs, bans smoking within {{convert|15|ft}} of openings in the targeted buildings, and requires at least 75% of rooms in each [[hotel]] to be non-smoking. It replaced the more limited Illinois Clean Indoor Air Act (410 ILCS 80).

==Enactment==
On January 11, 2007, [[Illinois Senate|Illinois State Senator]] [[John J. Cullerton]] introduced comprehensive [[legislation]] that would make Illinois workplaces and indoor [[public place]]s [[tobacco smoke|smoke]]-free. Similar legislation was also introduced in the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] as House [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] 246 by Representative [[Karen Yarbrough]]. The [[American Lung Association]] and the [[American Cancer Society]] of Illinois joined more than 450 other organizations in applauding State Senator Cullerton and State Representative Karen Yarbrough for this important step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lungusa.org/associations/states/illinois/advocacy/smoke-free-illinois-act.html |title=Smoke Free Illinois Act - American Lung Association |publisher=Lungusa.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Illinois General Assembly]] put the Smoke-Free Illinois Act  into effect beginning January 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=095-0017 |title=ILGA.gov |publisher=ILGA.gov |date=2005-06-30 |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per Damon T. Arnold, M.D., M.P.H Director of the [[Illinois Department of Public Health]], "The Smoke-free Illinois Website is designed to provide a variety of informational resources. I encourage you to read the information contained here to become more informed about the Smoke-free Illinois law, to access information about secondhand smoke, to seek assistance to quit smoking or to lodge a complaint about a possible violation."&lt;ref name="smoke-free"/&gt;

==Locations==
As of January 1, 2008, the Smoke-Free Illinois Act requires that public places and places of employment must be completely smoke-free inside and within 15 feet from entrances, exits, windows that open and [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation intakes]].&lt;ref name="smoke-free"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smoke-free.illinois.gov |title=Smoke-free.Illinois.gov |publisher=Smoke-free.Illinois.gov |date=2008-01-01 |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes but is not limited to:
* Public places and buildings, [[office]]s, [[elevator]]s, [[restroom]]s, [[theater]]s, [[museum]]s, [[library|libraries]], [[educational institution]]s, [[school]]s, [[commerce|commercial establishments]], enclosed [[shopping center]]s and [[retail store]]s

==Enforcement==
The Smoke Free Illinois Act (Senate Bill 500, P.A. 95-0017), and codified as 410 ILCS 82 took effect January 1, 2008. It repeals the Illinois Clean Indoor Air Act (410 ILCS 80) and it amends the State Mandates Act ({{ILCS|30|805}}) by adding Section 8.31. Enforcement, fines, and proprietor responsibilities are outlined per the Illinois Municipal League Newsletter dated December 13, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iml.org Iml.org]{{Page needed|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2010}}
; Enforcement
The Illinois Department of Public Health, local public health departments, and local law enforcement agencies are required to enforce the act. These agencies may assess fines to any corporation, partnership, association or other entity violating the no smoking provisions of the act. Each day that a violation occurs is a separate violation. ({{ILCS|410|82|40}})
; Fines
A person who smokes in a prohibited area shall be fined from $100 to $250. A person who owns, operates, or otherwise controls a public place or place of employment that violates the act shall be fined not less than $250 for the first violation, not less than $500 for the second violation within one year after the first violation, and not less than $2,500 for each additional violation within one year after the first violation. ({{ILCS|410|82|45}})
; Proprietor Responsibilities
Post a "no smoking" sign at each entrance. Do not permit smoking in a public place, a place of employment or within 15 feet of any entrance. Remove ashtrays from all areas where smoking is prohibited. ({{ILCS|410|82|20}})

==Working with violators==
{{Update|section|date=April 2010}}
{{As of|2008|2|5}}, [[Peoria County, Illinois|Peoria]], [[Tazewell County, Illinois|Tazewell]], [[Woodford County, Illinois|Woodford]], and [[Fulton County, Illinois|Fulton]] counties' Health Departments have not fined any businesses for violations of the smoking ban yet. Instead, they are trying to work with the businesses in order to educate them about the law. Brian Tun, the director of health promotion at the Peoria County Health Department, estimated that about forty complaints had been made in the Peoria County area already. If they do not send someone to investigate, they will send a letter to remind the business to comply with the law. He also stated a second warning letter has not been necessary to send out yet. The Health Department officials are undecided on how to handle additional violations after the second warning, if they are to go beyond the state's minimums. Sara Sparkman is the Tazewell County Health Department's Community Relations Manager. She said they have received seventeen complaints from nine separate locations. Violations include an informative letter for a first violation, a warning letter for a second violation, a meeting with the owner for a third violation, and probably fines after that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pjstar.com PJStar.com]{{Date missing|date=April 2010}}{{Page needed|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Date missing|date=April 2010}}{{Page needed|date=April 2010}}

==Loopholes==
Some business owners operate a smoking area through a loophole in the law. For around $5,000, a business could install a smoking hut or shack  outside their establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-smoking-shackjan29,0,2108731.story |title=Thank you for smoking –in a hut |publisher=Chicagotribune.com |date=2008-01-29 |accessdate=2011-08-17 |first=Liam |last=Ford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the state and city regulations have not been formed yet, owners can install these for their employees as well as their customers. Many bar owners are even going as far as installing TVs in their smoking huts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-smokehuts20080128214420,0,1920948.photo |title=Employees taking a break in a smoke hut |publisher=Chicagotribune.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assistance for hospital employees==
From 1993 to 1996, the [[University of Missouri-Columbia School of Medicine]] decided to run an experiment, partially funded by the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] (RWJF),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rwjf.org/reports/grr/022931.htm |title=Smoke-Free Hospitals Lead to Smoke-Free Employees |publisher=Rwjf.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has a national program known as the Tobacco Policy Research and Evaluation Program. The researchers were on a quest to find out if the new smoke-free restrictions put on hospitals would hinder or help the facility's employees. They tested on over a thousand hospitals. Notable results were found that included hospital compliance to the new laws, employees who were under this ban were more likely to quit, and smokers under pressure from fellow employees to follow the rules were more apt to stop smoking as well.

==Challenges to law==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
The Smoke Free Illinois Act has been challenged many times in [[Illinois circuit courts]] and, generally speaking, cases have been dismissed when various challenges were raised. In an effort to make the statute enforceable, the General Assembly passed changes to the Smoke Free Illinois Act to specify that enforcement would occur before an administrative agency, rather than before courts. However, the new amendments specify that the agency, the Illinois Department of Public Health, does not have the authority to pass rules or regulations under the new statute, without first gaining approval from the Legislature. Some believe that this renders the statute unconstitutional, because enforcement actions before the agency will concern only interpretation and enforcement of a statute, rather than of a statute in combination with an agency's rules or regulations. Interpreting and enforcing statutes, without reference to agency rules or regulations, has traditionally been the province of the Illinois courts, rather than being left to agencies to adjudicate. So if the Illinois Department of Public Health attempts to enforce the newly amended statute, it is anticipated that there will be a constitutional challenge claiming that the delegation of authority to the agency fails and that it intrudes on the traditional role of courts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3247">The '''Society for Public Health Education''' (SOPHE) is an independent professional society of health educators, academics, and education researchers that was founded in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;http://sophe.org/member_resources.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
SOPHE's mission is to "Promote the health of all people through education.".&lt;ref&gt;http://sophe.org/Sophe/PDF/2011_2012SOPHEMembershipPresentation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; SOPHE advocates and promotes healthy behaviors, healthy communities, and healthy environments through its membership, its network of local chapters, and numerous relationships with global, national, or local organizations, both public and private.

As an organization, SOPHE also aims to "stimulate" research on [[health education]] theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;http://sophe.org/journals_publications.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; SOPHE's official peer-reviewed journals include Health Education &amp; Behavior and Health Promotion Practice.

SOPHE also advocates [[health policy]] legislation in the United States and other countries, specifically in favor of advancing the profession of [[health education]] and promotion, as well as the capacity of governments to fulfill the [[health education]] needs of the public. SOPHE is the only independent organization whose purpose is to exclusively promote [[public health]] education.

==Membership==
SOPHE has roughly 4,000 members, but this varies from year to year. Its membership represents a diversity of disciplines that span professionals in health and medical education, fitness, school health, public health research, clinical research, health promotion, health policymakers, environmental health educators, and other community health professionals and students in the United States and more than 25 other countries. Members of SOPHE are known to work in elementary and secondary schools, universities and colleges, for-profit organizations, voluntary non-profit organizations, health care settings, worksites, and local/state/federal government agencies, and clinical research organizations.

According to its 2011 report, approximately 60% of SOPHE's members have earned a postgraduate degree, including [[Master of Public Health]] (MPH), [[Doctor of Public Health]] (DrPH), and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD), or Doctor of Education (DEd or EdD).&lt;ref&gt;http://sophe.org/Sophe/PDF/2011_2012SOPHEMembershipPresentation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Many SOPHE members are also certified health education specialists, or "CHES" as credentialed by the [[National Commission for Health Education Credentialing]], but this is not universal across the society.

==Chapters==
SOPHE has 20 active chapters covering 34 states, including Northern Mexico and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://sophe.org/Sophe/PDF/2011_2012SOPHEMembershipPresentation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization Designation==
SOPHE is registered in the United States as a 501 (c)(3) professional non-profit organization.

'''Suicide in Greenland''' is a significant national social issue. [[Greenland]] has the highest [[List of countries by suicide rate|suicide rate in the world]]: reports between 1985 and 2012 showed that an average of 83 people in 100,000 committed [[suicide]], more than twice the rate of the second placed country, [[Suicide in Lithuania|Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;Unless otherwise stated all statistics are from WHO: {{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide_rates/en/ |title=Suicide rates per 100,000 by country, year and sex (Table) |accessdate=2012-01-26 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |year=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122021659/http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide_rates/en/ |archivedate=2012-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Greenland is a geographically and culturally isolated nation, as well as one of the coldest and least populous countries in the world. Although facts like these may contribute to suicide-related issues, it is not clear if they have direct influences on Greenlandic suicides. Furthermore, different initiatives have been taken to reduce the suicide rate in the country, such as roadside posters,&lt;ref name="The Suicide Capital of the World"/&gt; and a national suicide prevention strategy involving courses, education, local communities and professionals (such as teachers, social workers and doctors) has been initiated.&lt;ref name="NationalPlan2013"&gt;{{Citation | first = | last = Departementet for Sundhed og Infrastruktur | title = National strategi for selvmordsforebyggelse i Grønland 2013-2019 (National Strategy for suicide prevention in Greenland 2013-2019) | year = 2013 | publisher = [[Naalakkersuisut]] (Government of Greenland) | url = http://www.inatsisartut.gl/dvd/EM2013/pdf/media/1020463/pkt25_em2013_national_strategi_til_forebyggelse_af_selvmord_i_groenland_rg_dk.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The number of suicides in Greenland began to rise in the 1970s; it kept increasing until 1986. In 1986, suicide was the leading cause of death in several towns, such as [[Sarfannguit]].&lt;ref name="The Suicide Capital of the World"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Suicide Capital of the World|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dispatches/2009/10/the_suicide_capital_of_the_world.single.html#pagebreak_anchor_2|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, the rate of suicide in Greenland was historically very low, but by 1990–1994, it had become one of the highest in the world with 107 per 100,000 persons committing suicide per year.&lt;ref name=BMC&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Björkstén | first1 = K.

==Incidence and variance==
An article published in the journal ''[[BioMed Central|BMC Psychiatry]]'' in 2009 reported that a total of 1,351 suicides took place in Greenland during the study period of 35 years (1968–2002). In the study, significant seasonal variation of the suicide rate was noted, characterized by peaks in June and troughs in the winter.&lt;ref name=BMC/&gt; The clustering of suicides in summer months was more pronounced in areas north of the [[Arctic Circle]].&lt;ref name=BMC/&gt; Regional variations are also observed; suicide rates in northern parts of west Greenland are higher than in southern parts.&lt;ref name="Leineweber" /&gt;

Suicide rates are higher for men than women. Most of the people dying by suicide are young men between the ages of 15-24. Unlike in other Western countries, the suicide rate in Greenland decreases with age.&lt;ref name="Leineweber" /&gt;

== Reasons ==
Several reasons are blamed for Greenland's high rate of suicide, including alcoholism, depression, poverty, conflict-ridden relationship with spouse, dysfunctional parental homes, etc. According to a report published in 2009, the suicide rate in Greenland increases during the summer. Researchers have blamed [[insomnia]] caused by incessant daylight.&lt;ref name="Greenland's Constant Summer Sunlight Linked To Summer Suicide Spike"&gt;{{cite web|title=Greenland's Constant Summer Sunlight Linked To Summer Suicide Spike|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090507190558.htm|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Culture clash]] between the traditional [[Inuit culture]] and modern [[Western culture]] is also assumed to be a contributing factor.&lt;ref name="Retterstøl1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nils Retterstøl|title=Suicide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCCHtVitcKwC&amp;pg=PA26|accessdate=16 March 2013|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42099-0|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common methods ==
Violent methods were used in 95% of suicide deaths.&lt;ref name=BMC /&gt; The most common methods were hanging (46%) and shooting (37%);&lt;ref name=BMC /&gt; other methods, such as jumping from heights, cutting with sharp objects, drowning, overdose of medication, and poisoning were also used, but less frequently.&lt;ref name="Leineweber"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.mipi.nanoq.gl/Emner/~/media/mipi/MIPI_Viden_om_boern_og_unge/Projekter_og_rapportsamling/Opgaver_og_specialer/Modernization%20and%20mental%20health%20-%20Suicide%20among%20the%20Inuit%20in%20Greenland%20-%20Leineweber.ashx | title=Modernization and Mental Health: Suicide among the Inuit in Greenland | accessdate=March 16, 2013 | author=Markus J. Leineweber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suicide prevention ==
Greenland's government and international and national organizations have undertaken efforts and initiatives to [[Suicide prevention|prevent suicides]]. There are associations that provide support for people who feel suicidal. Measures include posters placed along the roads, which read: "The call is free. No one is alone. Don't be alone with your dark thoughts. Call."&lt;ref name="The Suicide Capital of the World" /&gt;&lt;ref name=BMC /&gt; Suicide consultants show films discouraging teenage suicide attempts.&lt;ref name="Singing" /&gt; The first national suicide prevention strategy was initiated in 2005, followed by another in 2013 that involves courses, education, local communities and professionals (such as teachers, social workers and doctors).&lt;ref name="NationalPlan2013"/&gt; It also highlighted a number of places where further studies are needed.&lt;ref name="NationalPlan2013"/&gt;

[[File:Kvinde-emancipation.gif|300px|thumb|The 1929 "Torches of Freedom" [[public relations]] campaign equated smoking with female emancipation. This image from Germany actually predates the American campaign. In various forms and places around the world, the campaign continues to this day.]]'''"Torches of Freedom"''' was a phrase used to encourage women's smoking by exploiting women's aspirations for a better life during the [[women's liberation movement]]{{when|date=May 2017}} in the United States. [[Cigarettes]] were described as symbols of emancipation and equality with men. The term was first used by psychoanalyst [[A. A. Brill]] when describing the natural desire for women to smoke and was used by [[Edward Bernays]] to encourage women to smoke in public despite social taboos. Bernays hired women to march while smoking their “torches of freedom” in the Easter Sunday Parade of 1929 which was a significant moment for fighting social barriers for women smokers.

==History==

===Smoking as an inappropriate act for women===
Before the twentieth century smoking was seen as a habit that was corrupt and inappropriate for women.  Dutch painters used cigarettes as a symbol of human foolishness in the 17th century and in the 19th century, cigarettes were perceived as props of “fallen women” and prostitutes.&lt;ref name=Amos&gt;Amos, Amanda, and Margaretha Haglund. "From Social Taboo to "Torch of Freedom": the Marketing of Cigarettes to Women ." ''Tobacco Control'' 9.1 (2000). Web. 28 Apr 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Women’s smoking was seen as immoral and some states tried to prevent women from smoking by enforcing laws.  In 1904 a woman named Jennie Lasher was sentenced to thirty days in jail for putting her children’s morals at risk by smoking in their presence and in 1908 the New York City Board of Aldermen unanimously passed an ordinance that prohibited smoking by women in public.&lt;ref name=Brandt2007-57&gt;Brandt, Allan M. (2007). ''The Cigarette Century''. New York: Basic Books, page 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in 1921 a bill was proposed to prohibit women from smoking in the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name=Amos/&gt;  Some women’s groups also fought against women smoking. The International Tobacco League lobbied for filmmakers to refrain from putting women smoking cigarettes in movies unless the women being portrayed were of “discreditable” character and other women’s groups asked young girls to sign pledges saying that they would not use tobacco.&lt;ref name=Brandt-AMWA&gt;Brandt, Allen M.  “Recruiting Women Smokers:  the Engineering of Consent.” ''Journal of the American Medical Women's Association'' 51.1-2 (1996). Web. 28 Apr 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  These groups saw smoking as an immoral activity and a threat.  Yet during [[World War I]] as women took the jobs of men who had gone to war, they also began smoking even though it was still considered a taboo act.&lt;ref name=Amos/&gt;  Cigarettes were a way for women to challenge social norms and fight for equal rights as men.  Eventually for women the cigarette came to symbolize “rebellious independence, glamour, seduction and sexual allure for both [[feminists]] and [[flappers]].”&lt;ref name=Brandt-AMWA/&gt;

===Advertising to women===
[[File:Cigarette ad cyclist 1900.jpg|thumb|1900 cigarette ad; targeting women is not a new strategy]]
[[File:Erdt Illu1914 Batschari.jpg|thumb|A 1914 ad targeting women. Tobacco companies have long targeted the female market, seeing it as a potential growth area.&lt;ref name="tobaccofreekids1"&gt;[http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/Script/DisplayPressRelease.php3?Display=348 Statement: Surgeon General's Report on Women and Tobacco Underscores Need for Congress to Grant FDA Authority Over Tobacco (Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205150206/http://tobaccofreekids.org/Script/DisplayPressRelease.php3?Display=348 |date=2005-02-05 }}. Tobaccofreekids.org.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Cigarette companies began selectively advertising to women in the late 1920s.{{dubious|date=May 2018}} In 1928 [[George Washington Hill]], the president of the [[American Tobacco Company]], realized the potential market that could be found in women and said, “It will be like opening a gold mine right in our front yard.” Yet some women who were already smoking were seen as smoking incorrectly. In 1919 a hotel manager said that women “don’t really know what to do with the smoke. Neither do they know how to hold their cigarettes properly.  Actually they make a mess of the whole performance.”&lt;ref name=Amos/&gt; Tobacco companies had to make sure that women would not be ridiculed for using cigarettes in public and [[Philip Morris (tobacconist)|Philip Morris]] even sponsored a lecture series that taught women the art of smoking.&lt;ref name=Amos/&gt;

To expand the number of women smokers Hill decided to hire [[Edward Bernays]], who today is known as the father of public relations, to help him recruit women smokers. Bernays decided to attempt to eliminate the social taboo against women smoking in public. He gained advice from psychoanalyst [[A. A. Brill]], who stated that it was normal for women to smoke because of [[Oral stage|oral fixation]] and said, “Today the emancipation of women has suppressed many of their feminine desires. More women now do the same work as men do. Many women bear no children; those who do bear have fewer children. Feminine traits are masked. Cigarettes, which are equated with men, become torches of freedom.”&lt;ref name=Brandt2007-84-85&gt;Brandt, Allan M. (2007). ''The Cigarette Century''. New York: Basic Books, pp. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 Bernays decided to pay women to smoke their “torches of freedom” as they walked in the [[Easter Sunday Parade]] in New York. This was a shock because until that time, women were only permitted to smoke in certain places such as in the privacy of their own homes. He was very careful when picking women to march because “while they should be good looking, they should not look too model-y” and he hired his own photographers to make sure that good pictures were taken and then published around the world.&lt;ref name=Brandt2007-84-85/&gt;  Feminist [[Ruth Hale (feminist)|Ruth Hale]] also called for women to join in the march saying, “Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!” &lt;ref name=Brandt2007-84-85/&gt; Once the footage was released, the campaign was being talked about everywhere, the women’s walk was seen as a protest for equality and sparked discussion throughout the nation and is still known today. The targeting of women in tobacco advertising led to higher rates of smoking among women. In 1923 women only purchased 5% of cigarettes sold, in 1929 that percentage increased to 12%, in 1935 to 18.1%, peaking in 1965 at 33.3%, and remaining at this level until 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Keefe |first=Anne Marie |first2=Richard W. |last2=Pollay |title=Deadly Targeting of Women in Promoting Cigarettes |journal=Journal of the American Medical Women's Association |volume=51 |issue=1–2 |year=1996 |pmid=8868553 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990s resurgence==
[[File:Woman smoking a cigarette.jpg|thumb|160px|left|The "Torches of Freedom" idea saw a resurgence in the 1990s far beyond the borders of America where tobacco advertising was now becoming increasingly restricted.]]
In the 1990s, tobacco companies continued to advertise cigarettes as “torches of freedom” as they sought to expand their markets around the world. Such brands as [[Virginia Slims]] continued to put forward the idea of modernity and freedom in new markets. The use of this imagery when advertising the cigarette has been specifically targeted at women in countries where women are gaining more equality and liberation.
 
The images used in the advertising campaigns differ by region.  In Spain they use images of women in masculine jobs, such as a fighter pilot, to appeal to young women-- and the smoking rates among young women in Spain increased from 17% in 1978 to 27% in 1997.&lt;ref name=Amos/&gt;  Tobacco companies are also using the cigarette as an image of emancipation in eastern and central Europe where cigarettes are shown as symbols of Western freedom.&lt;ref name=Amos/&gt;  In the 1990s Germany was a focus for advertising, and between 1993 and 1997 the smoking rates among women aged 12–25 in Germany went from 27% to 47% even though the increase in men’s smoking for the same age group is much smaller.&lt;ref name=Amos/&gt;  In Japan, various cigarettes advertised to women have encouraged women to be unique.  A survey by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare showed that between 1986 and 1999 smoking among women had increased from 10.5% to 23.2%.&lt;ref name=Amos/&gt;  Advertisements in South Africa have shown women crossing racial barriers as black women are shown accepting cigarettes from white men and in India women have been portrayed in Western clothes with cigarettes as a sign of liberation and upward mobility.&lt;ref name=Amos/&gt;  In Asia it is becoming more acceptable for women to smoke and this is leading to a greater demand.&lt;ref name=Brandt2007-57/&gt;  Tobacco companies advertise to women around the world, showing cigarettes as symbols of upward mobility, gender equality and freedom.  The impacts of tobacco companies targeting women can be seen by the increase in the number of women who started smoking in recent years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1391">'''ULTRA''', the '''Unrelated Live Transplant Regulatory Authority''', was a British agency that regulated [[organ transplant]]s.  According to the official website:

:The [[Human Organ Transplants Act]] 1989 ("the HOT Act") forbids payment for organs and places considerable restrictions on transplants between living persons...  ULTRA was established to consider applications made by registered medical practitioners seeking approval to transplant an organ between two living unrelated persons in the UK and to establish that the conditions set out in the Regulations governing transplants between living genetically unrelated persons, are satisfied. Specifically ULTRA examines each case to determine whether there is evidence or suggestion of payment for organs or of inducement, coercion or pressure to donate.

In September 2006, ULTRA disbanded.  Its functions were transferred to the [[Human Tissue Authority]], a [[Non-departmental public body]] of the Department of Health.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11321">'''Veterinary anesthesia''' is [[anesthesia]] performed on non-human animals by a [[veterinarian]] or a Registered Veterinary Technician.&lt;ref name=Lumb&gt;{{cite book| last = Grimm |author2=Thurmon, John Tranquilli W.J.  | title = Lumb and Jones Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia | publisher = Blackwell Publishing Inc | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-7817-5471-2|first = Kurt}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anesthesia is used for a wider range of circumstances in animals than in people, due to animals' inability to cooperate with certain diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.  Veterinary anesthesia includes anesthesia of the major species: dogs, cats, horses, cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs, as well as all other animals requiring veterinary care such as birds, [[pocket pet]]s, and wildlife.&lt;ref name="Lumb"/&gt;

==Specialization in anesthesia==
In North America, the American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia is one of 21 specialty organizations recognized by the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]].&lt;ref name=Specialists&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.avma.org/ProfessionalDevelopment/Education/Specialties/Pages/Recognized-veterinary-specialty-organizations.aspx| title=Veterinary Specialty Organizations| accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ACVAA was recognized by the AVMA in 1975, despite attempts by the AVMA to include anesthesia as a subspecialty of [[American College of Veterinary Surgeons|surgery]] or medicine.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.acva.org/general/history.asp| title=ACVA History| accessdate=2007-05-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070127121236/http://www.acva.org/general/history.asp |archivedate = 2007-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2016, there are more than 250 diplomates of the ACVAA.&lt;ref name=Number&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.acvaa.org/Directory| title=ACVAA Directory| accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To become an ACVAA board-certified Diplomate, veterinarians must have at least one year of clinical practice experience followed by three years of anesthesia residency training under the supervision of ACVAA Diplomates, have accepted for publication a scientific [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[Academic publishing|research article]], and passed both a written and oral examination.

In Europe, the [[European College of Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia]] (ECVAA) is one of 23 specialty organizations recognized by the European Board of Veterinary Specialisation. As of February 2014, there are 147 ECVA Diplomates.

==Anesthesia technicians==
Evidence exists that suggests that anesthesia which is supervised by a qualified [[veterinary technician|technician]] is safer than anesthesia without a technician.&lt;ref name=Risk&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dyson D.H. |author2=Maxie M.G. |author3=Shnurr D  |title=Morbidity and mortality associated with anesthetic management in small animal veterinary practice in Ontario |journal=Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association |year=1998|volume=34|pages=325–335|pmid=9657167|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most private veterinary practices, the technician administers and monitors anesthesia with supervision from the attending veterinarian.  In many academic institutions, anesthesia technicians are involved in working with and teaching veterinary students as well as supervising anesthetized cases.  The Academy of Veterinary Technicians in Anesthesia and Analgesia  is a provisional specialty academy of the North American Veterinary Technician Association and is responsible for licensing technicians as being specialized in anesthesia.  For a technician to become specialized, they must be a licensed technician in their state, accumulate 6000 hours of work in veterinary medicine (at least 75% of which must be in anesthesia), 40 hours of continuing education related to anesthesia, demonstrate proficiency in anesthesia skills, and pass a comprehensive written examination.&lt;ref name=AVTA&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.avta-vts.org/| title=Academy of Veterinary Technician Anesthetists| accessdate=2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application in animals==
Anesthesia is required for many surgical procedures which require the patient to be immobile, unaware, and without pain. Furthermore, anesthesia aims to minimize the [[surgical stress]] response. In addition, certain diagnostic procedures require anesthesia, notably stomach or airway [[endoscopy]], [[bone marrow examination|bone marrow sampling]], and occasionally [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]].  Aggressive animals may require anesthesia in order to handle and perform a physical exam or obtain blood for testing.  Exotic animals frequently require anesthesia for simple procedures (such as taking a [[radiograph]] or catheter placement) due to lack of domesticity.  Animals may require anesthesia for therapeutic procedures, such as [[urinary catheterization]] to relieve obstruction, injection into a mass, or removing fluid from the eye to treat glaucoma.

In addition to anesthesia, [[analgesia]] is often managed by anesthesiologists or is included in the considerations for anesthesia.

==Techniques==
===Small animals===
[[File:Intubated Cat.jpg|thumb|An anesthetized cat]]
Cats and dogs are frequently anesthetized for surgical procedures.  Small animals are most often placed under general anesthesia due to the types of procedures typically performed, the small size of the patient, their suitability to general anesthesia, and the greater degree of control.  A balanced anesthesia protocol can be used whereby different drugs with different effects are used so that a high dose of just one drug can be avoided.  For example, combining a [[sedative]] and an [[opioid]] will permit less [[inhalant]] anesthesia to be used, improving cardiovascular stability. A one-year study in a teaching hospital shows that dogs and cats typically experience a 1 in 9 chance of anesthetic complications, with a 1 in 233 risk of death.&lt;ref name=Death&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gaynor |first1=J. S. |last2=Dunlop |first2=C. I. |last3=Wagner |first3=A.E. |display-authors=etal |date=January 1999 |title=Complications and mortality associated with anesthesia in dogs and cats |journal=Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=13–17 |doi=10.5326/15473317-35-1-13 |pmid=9934922}}&lt;/ref&gt; A larger-scale study states the risk of death in healthy dogs and cats as 1 in 1849 and 1 in 895 respectively. For sick dogs and cats, it was 1 in 75 and 1 in 71 respectively. For rabbits, the risk was 1 in 137 and 1 in 14 respectively for the healthy and sick groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Brodbelt DC, Blissitt KJ, Hammond RA, etal |title=The risk of death: the confidential enquiry into perioperative small animal fatalities |journal=Vet Anaesth Analg |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=365–73 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18466167 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-2995.2008.00397.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horses and ruminants===
Many procedures can be performed on the standing horse with heavy sedation alone.  Some procedures may require general anesthesia due to the location of surgery (for example, [[gelding|castration]]).  Other procedures in horses require general anesthesia using an inhalant anesthetic.  Horses, due to their complex physiology as performance animals, suffer a number of difficulties that can complicate anesthesia.  This results in horses having a higher risk of perioperative fatality - approximately 1 in 400.&lt;ref name=Horses&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnston |first1=G. M. |last2=Eastment |first2=J. K. |last3=Woods |first3=J. L. N. |display-authors=etal |date=2002 |title=The confidential enquiry into perioperative equine fatalities (CEPEF): mortality results of Phases 1 and 2.|journal=Journal of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=159–170 |doi=10.1046/j.1467-2995.2002.00106.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most procedures in ruminants can be performed standing under sedation and/or local anesthesia.  This strategy is manageable due to the types of procedures being performed, the larger size of the patient, the relative difficulty of general anesthesia, and the cost of the procedure versus the product value of the animal.

===Exotic pets===
[[File:Revisión Águila real.JPG|thumb|An anesthetized eagle]]
Anesthesia of exotic animals (guinea pigs, rabbits, birds) is challenging and the higher peri-anesthetic mortality in these species compared to dogs and cats, attests to this fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brodbelt David C | year = 2009 | title = Perioperative mortality in small animal anaesthesia | url = | journal = Veterinary Journal (London) | volume = 182 | issue = | pages = 152–161 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These animals are challenging to anesthetize for a number of reasons: very little research has been carried out on safe and effective drug doses for specific species; exotic pets often 'hide' the fact that they are sick and by the time owners realize how sick the pet is the course of the disease is far advanced; the unique anatomy and physiology of exotic pets poses challenges for anesthetic management. For example, the anatomy of the respiratory system of birds, Guinea pigs, and reptiles makes it difficult to induce and maintain anesthesia solely with inhalation agents such as [[isoflurane]] and [[sevoflurane]]. Injectable drugs such as sedatives or tranquilizers are often used in these patients to facilitate induction and maintenance of anesthesia.

==Anesthetic agents==
Most [[anesthesia|anesthetic agents]] used in human medicine are used in veterinary medicine.  [[Adrenergic receptor|Alpha-2 receptor]] [[agonist]] drugs such as [[xylazine]], [[romifidine]], [[detomidine]], and [[medetomidine]], are used frequently in veterinary species (particularly large animal), but are rarely used in people.  [[Guaifenesin]] is used as a muscle relaxant prior to anesthesia induction in some animals.  [[Propofol]] is commonly used in small animal anesthesia, however it is rarely used in large animals due to the cost. 'Propoclear' is also commonly used in smaller branches of small animal surgery as it has a longer shelf life once opened than [[propofol]] whilst essentially having the same properties.  [[Butorphanol]] is rarely used in people but is commonly used in all species.  [[Ketamine]], used in children for anesthesia, is used extensively in many species to induce anesthesia or cause heavy sedation.  Expensive agents, such as [[etomidate]] and [[desflurane]] are rarely used outside of university hospitals.  Different species have different responses to drugs.  For example, horses may experience mania with [[morphine]] whereas dogs typically become sedated.  Rabbits and guinea pigs are well sedated with [[midazolam]], which can occasionally excite dogs and cats.

'''Water scarcity''' is the lack of [[fresh water]] resources to meet [[Capitalism#Supply and demand|water demand]]. It affects every continent and was listed in 2015 by the [[World Economic Forum]] as the largest [[Global Risks Report|global risk]] in terms of potential impact over the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/01/why-world-water-crises-are-a-top-global-risk/ |title=Water crises are a top global risk |publisher=World Economic Forum |date=16 January 2015 |access-date=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is manifested by partial or no satisfaction of expressed demand, economic competition for water quantity or quality, disputes between users, irreversible depletion of [[groundwater]], and negative impacts on the [[Environment (biology)|environment]].&lt;ref name="FAO2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3015e/i3015e.pdf |title=Coping with water scarcity.

A mere 0.014% of all [[Water distribution on Earth|water on Earth]] is both fresh and easily [[Water supply|accessible]]. Of the remaining water, 97% is saline and a little less than 3% is hard to access. Technically, there is a sufficient amount of freshwater on a global scale. However, due to unequal distribution (exacerbated by [[climate change]]) resulting in some very wet and some very dry geographic locations, plus a sharp rise in global freshwater demand in recent decades driven by industry, humanity is facing a '''water crisis'''. Demand is expected to outstrip supply by 40% in 2030, if current trends continue.&lt;ref name="weforum17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCDO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdo.nl/sites/default/files/Globaliseringsreeks%203%20Water.pdf |title=Water, bron van ontwikkeling, macht en conflict |publisher=NCDO, Netherlands |date=8 January 2012 |access-date=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of global water scarcity is the geographic and temporal mismatch between [[freshwater]] demand and availability.&lt;ref&gt;S. L. Postel, G. C. Daily, P. R. Ehrlich, Human appropriation of renewable fresh water. [[Science (journal)|Science]] '''271''', 785–788 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. H. G. Savenije, Water scarcity indicators; the deception of the numbers. Physics and Chemistry of the Earth B '''25''', 199–204 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing [[world population]], improving [[living standard]]s, changing [[consumer behaviour|consumption patterns]], and expansion of [[irrigation|irrigated agriculture]] are the main driving forces for the rising global demand for water.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Vörösmarty, P. Green, J. Salisbury, R. B. Lammers, Global water resources: Vulnerability from climate change and population growth. [[Science (journal)|Science]] '''289''', 284–288  (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Ercin, A. Y. Hoekstra, Water footprint scenarios for 2050: A global analysis. [[Environment International]] '''64''', 71–82 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Climate change]], such as altered weather-patterns (including [[droughts]] or [[floods]]), [[deforestation]], increased [[Water pollution|pollution]], green house gases, and wasteful use of water can cause insufficient supply.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://worldwildlife.org/threats/water-scarcity |title = Water Scarcity. Threats |work= WWF |year = 2013 |access-date = 20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the global level and on an annual basis, enough freshwater is available to meet such demand, but [[Spatial analysis|spatial]] and temporal variations of water demand and availability are large, leading to (physical) water scarcity in several parts of the world during specific times of the year.&lt;ref name="7 billion" /&gt; All causes of water scarcity are related to human interference with the [[water cycle]]. Scarcity varies over time as a result of natural [[hydrology|hydrological]] variability, but varies even more so as a function of prevailing economic policy, planning and management approaches. Scarcity can be expected to intensify with most forms of [[economic development]], but, if correctly identified, many of its causes can be predicted, avoided or mitigated.&lt;ref name="FAO2012"/&gt;

Some countries have already proven that decoupling water use from [[economic growth]] is possible. For example, in Australia, water consumption declined by 40% between 2001 and 2009 while the economy grew by more than 30%.&lt;ref name="decoupling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.unep.org/northamerica/news/2016/half-world-face-severe-water-stress-2030-unless-water-use-decoupled-economic-growth-says |title=Half the world to face severe water stress by 2030 unless water use is "decoupled" from economic growth, says International Resource Panel |publisher=[[UN Environment]] |date=21 March 2016 |access-date=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Resource Panel]] of the [[United Nations|UN]] states that governments have tended to invest heavily in largely inefficient solutions: mega-projects like [[dam]]s, [[canal]]s, [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s, pipelines and water reservoirs, which are generally neither environmentally sustainable nor economically viable. The most [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effective]] way of decoupling water use from economic growth, according to the scientific panel, is for [[government]]s to create [[Systems ecology|holistic]] water [[Integrated water resources management|management plans]] that take into account the entire water cycle: from source to distribution, economic use, [[Water treatment|treatment]], [[Reclaimed water|recycling]], reuse and return to the environment.&lt;ref name="decoupling" /&gt;

==Supply &amp; demand==
[[File:GlobalWaterWithdrawals.jpg|thumb|Global use of freshwater, 2016 FAO data]]
[[File:Annualglobalwaterconsumption.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Global water consumption 1900-2025, by region, in billions m3 per year]]
The total amount of easily accessible freshwater on Earth, in the form of [[surface water]] ([[rivers]] and [[lakes]]) or [[groundwater]] (in [[aquifer]]s, for example), is 14.000 cubic kilometres (nearly 3359 cubic miles). Of this total amount, 'just' 5.000 cubic kilometres are being used and reused by humanity. Hence, in theory, there is more than enough freshwater available to meet the demands of the current world population of 7 billion people, and even support [[population growth]] to 9 billion or more. Due to the unequal geographical distribution and especially the unequal consumption of water, however, it is a scarce resource in some parts of the world and for some parts of the population.&lt;ref name="NCDO" /&gt;

Scarcity as a result of consumption is caused primarily by the extensive use of water in [[agriculture]]/[[Animal husbandry|livestock breeding]] and [[industry]]. People in developed countries generally use about 10 times more water daily than those in [[developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name="nextgrcr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/08/how-water-shortages-lead-food-crises-conflicts |title=Why fresh water shortages will cause the next great global crisis |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 March 2015 |access-date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of this is ''indirect use'' in water-intensive agricultural and industrial production processes of [[consumer goods]], such as fruit, oil seed crops and cotton. Because many of these production chains have been globalised, a lot of water in developing countries is being used and polluted in order to produce goods destined for consumption in developed countries.&lt;ref name="NCDO" /&gt;

==Physical  &amp;  economic scarcity==
Water scarcity can result from two mechanisms:

* [[physical water scarcity|physical (absolute) water scarcity]]
* [[economic water scarcity]]

Physical water scarcity results from inadequate natural water resources to supply a region's demand, and economic water scarcity results from poor management of the sufficient available water resources. According to the [[United Nations Development Programme]], the latter is found more often to be the cause of countries or regions experiencing water scarcity, as most countries or regions have enough water to meet household, industrial, agricultural, and environmental needs, but lack the means to provide it in an accessible manner.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;United Nations Development Programme (2006). [http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-report-2006 Human Development Report 2006: Beyond Scarcity–Power, Poverty and the Global Water Crisis]. Basingstoke, United Kingdom:Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;
Around one fifth of the world's population currently live in regions affected by [[Physical water scarcity]], where there is inadequate water resources to meet a country's or regional demand, including the water needed to fulfill the demand of ecosystems to function effectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed, such as when there is over development of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater as well as other forms of exploitation or overuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2006_Chapter_4.pdf|title = Water scarcity, risk and vulnerability|accessdate = 2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Economic water scarcity]] is caused by a lack of investment in infrastructure or technology to draw water from rivers, aquifers or other water sources, or insufficient human capacity to satisfy the demand for water. One quarter of the world's population is affected by economic water scarcity. Economic water scarcity includes a lack of infrastructure, causing the people without reliable access to water to have to travel long distances to fetch water, that is often contaminated from rivers for domestic and agricultural uses. Large parts of Africa suffer from economic water scarcity; developing water infrastructure in those areas could therefore help to reduce poverty. Critical conditions often arise for economically poor and politically weak communities living in already dry environment. Consumption increases with GDP per capita in most developed countries the average amount is around 200–300 litres daily. In underdeveloped countries (e.g. African countries such as Mozambique), average daily water consumption per capita was below 10 L. This is against the backdrop of international organisations, which recommend a minimum of 20 L of water (not including the water needed for washing clothes), available at most 1&amp;nbsp;km from the household. Increased water consumption is correlated with increasing income, as measured by GDP per capita. In countries suffering from water shortages water is the subject of speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first = Sergiusz| last = Prokurat|title =Drought and water shortages in Asia as a threat and economic problem|journal=Journal of Modern Science|date= 2015|accessdate=5 August 2016|location= Józefów|pages= 235–250|url= http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.desklight-95d2a7ec-8c5f-474d-84ed-8b8baed8f8c0/c/235_PDFsam_Joms_3_26_2015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human right to water==
[[File:Mwamongu water source.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|In [[Meatu district]], [[Simiyu Region]], Tanzania (Africa), water most often comes from open holes dug in the sand of dry riverbeds, and it is invariably contaminated. Many children are deprived of an education primarily due to this daily task.&lt;ref name="safe"&gt;[https://www.unicef.org/media/media_53234.html Lack of safe water and sanitation in schools affects children’s learning – and their lives] [[Unicef]] Published 5 April 2010.

{{Further|Right to water}}
The [[United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] established a foundation of five core attributes for water security. They declare that the human [[right to water]] entitles everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible, and affordable water for personal and domestic use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Millennium Development Goals (MDG)===
{{Main|Millennium Development Goals}}
At the 2000 [[Millennium Summit]], the United Nations addressed the effects of economic water scarcity by making increased access to safe drinking water an international development goal. During this time, they drafted the Millennium Development Goals and all 189 UN members agreed on eight goals. MDG 7 sets a target for reducing the proportion of the population without sustainable safe drinking water access by half by 2015. This would mean that more than 600 million people would gain access to a safe source of drinking water. In 2016, the  [[Sustainable Development Goals]] replaced the Millennium Development Goals

==Effects on environment==
Water scarcity has many negative impacts on the environment, including lakes, rivers, wetlands and other fresh water resources. The resulting water overuse that is related to water scarcity, often located in areas of irrigation agriculture, harms the environment in several ways including increased [[salinity]], [[nutrient pollution]], and the loss of [[floodplains]] and wetlands.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/article77.html|title = Water Scarcity Index – Vital Water Graphics|accessdate = 20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, water scarcity makes flow management in the rehabilitation of urban streams problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J.E. Lawrence |author2=C.P.W. Pavia |author3=S. Kaing|author4=H.N. Bischel|author5=R.G. Luthy|author6= V.H. Resh |title= Recycled Water for Augmenting Urban Streams in Mediterranean-climate Regions: A Potential Approach for Riparian Ecosystem Enhancement |journal=Hydrological Sciences Journal |year=2014 |volume=59 |pages= 488–501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the last hundred years, more than half of the Earth's wetlands have been destroyed and have disappeared.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These wetlands are important not only because they are the habitats of numerous inhabitants such as mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and [[invertebrates]], but they support the growing of rice and other food crops as well as provide [[water filtration]] and protection from storms and flooding. Freshwater lakes such as the [[Aral Sea]] in central Asia have also suffered. Once the fourth largest freshwater lake, it has lost more than 58,000 square km of area and vastly increased in salt concentration over the span of three decades.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Subsidence, or the gradual sinking of landforms, is another result of water scarcity. The [[U.S. Geological Survey]] estimates that subsidence has affected more than 17,000 square miles in 45 U.S. states, 80 percent of it due to groundwater usage. In some areas east of [[Houston, Texas]] the land has dropped by more than nine feet due to subsidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/water/scarcity/surprisingcosts.php Texas Water Report: Going Deeper for the Solution] Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. Retrieved 2/10/14.&lt;/ref&gt; Brownwood, a subdivision near [[Baytown, Texas]], was abandoned due to frequent flooding caused by subsidence and has since become part of the [[Baytown Nature Center]].

===Climate change===
[[Aquifer]] drawdown or overdrafting and the pumping of [[fossil water]] increases the total amount of water within the hydrosphere subject to transpiration and evaporation processes, thereby causing accretion in water vapour and cloud cover, the primary absorbers of infrared radiation in the earth's atmosphere. Adding water to the system has a forcing effect on the whole earth system, an accurate estimate of which hydrogeological fact is yet to be quantified.

==Depletion of freshwater resources==
[[File:AralShip.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|An abandoned ship in the former [[Aral Sea]], near [[Aral, Kazakhstan]]]]
Apart from the conventional surface water sources of freshwater such as rivers and lakes, other resources of freshwater such as groundwater and glaciers have become more developed sources of freshwater, becoming the main source of clean water. [[Groundwater]] is water that has pooled below the surface of the Earth and can provide a usable quantity of water through springs or wells. These areas where groundwater is collected are also known as aquifers. [[Glaciers]] provide freshwater in the form [[meltwater]], or freshwater melted from snow or ice, that supply streams or springs as temperatures rise. More and more of these sources are being drawn upon as conventional sources' usability decreases due to factors such as pollution or disappearance due to climate changes. The exponential growth rate of the human population is a main contributing factor in the increasing use of these types of water resources.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;WWAP (World Water Assessment Programme). 2012. ''The United Nations World Water Development Report 4: Managing Water under Uncertainty and Risk''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groundwater===
Until recent 2015, groundwater was not a highly utilized resource. In the 1960s, more and more groundwater aquifers developed. Changes in knowledge, technology and funding have allowed for focused development into abstracting water from groundwater resources away from surface water resources. These changes allowed for progress in society such as the "agricultural groundwater revolution", expanding the irrigation sector allowing for increased food production and development in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Giordano, M. and Volholth, K. (ed.) 2007. ''The Agricultural Groundwater Revolution''. Wallingford, UK, Centre for Agricultural Bioscience International (CABI).&lt;/ref&gt; Groundwater supplies nearly half of all drinking water in the world.&lt;ref&gt;WWAP (World Water Assessment Programme). 2009. ''Water in a Changing World. World Water Development Report 3.'' Paris/London, UNESCO Publishing/Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt; The large volumes of water stored underground in most aquifers have a considerable [[buffer capacity]] allowing for water to be withdrawn during periods of drought or little rainfall.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is crucial for people that live in regions that cannot depend on [[precipitation]] or surface water as a supply alone, instead providing reliable access to water all year round. As of 2010, the world's aggregated groundwater abstraction is estimated at approximately 1,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;per year, with 67% used for irrigation, 22% used for domestic purposes and 11% used for industrial purposes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The top ten major consumers of abstracted water (India, China, United States of America, Pakistan, Iran, Bangladesh, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Italy) make up 72% of all abstracted water use worldwide.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Groundwater has become crucial for the livelihoods and food security of 1.2 to 1.5 billion rural households in the poorer regions of Africa and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture. 2007. ''Water for Food, Water for Life: A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture''. London/Colomb, Earthscan/International Water Management Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

Although groundwater sources are quite prevalent, one major area of concern is the renewal rate or recharge rate of some groundwater sources. [[Abstracting]] from groundwater sources that are non-renewable could lead to exhaustion if not properly monitored and managed.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, S. and Loucks, D. 2006. ''Non-renewable Groundwater Resources''. UNESCO-IHP Groundwater series No. 10. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern of increased groundwater usage is the diminished water quality of the source over time. Reduction of natural outflows, decreasing stored volumes, declining water levels and water degradation are commonly observed in groundwater systems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Groundwater depletion may result in many negative effects such as increased cost of groundwater pumping, induced salinity and other water quality changes, land subsidence, degraded springs and reduced baseflows. Human pollution is also harmful to this important resource.

To set up a big plant near a water abundant area, bottled water companies need to extract groundwater from a source at a rate more than the replenishment rate leading to the persistent decline in the groundwater levels. The groundwater is taken out, bottled, and then shipped all over the country or world and this water never goes back. When the water table depletes beyond a critical limit, bottling companies just move from that area leaving a grave water scarcity. Groundwater depletion impacts everyone and everything in the area who uses water: farmers, businesses, animals, ecosystems, tourism, and the regular guy getting his water from a well. Millions of gallons of water out of the ground leaves the water table depleted uniformly and not just in that area because the water table is connected across the landmass. Bottling Plants generate water scarcity and impact ecological balance. They lead to water stressed areas which bring in droughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gasson |first1=Christopher |title=Don’t waste a drop |url=https://www.globalwaterintel.com/dont-waste-drop-water-mining/ |website=www.globalwaterintel.com |publisher=Mining Magazine |accessdate=30 August 2018 |ref=www.globalwaterintel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glaciers===
Glaciers are noted as a vital water source due to their contribution to [[stream flow]]. Rising global temperatures have noticeable effects on the rate at which glaciers melt, causing glaciers in general to shrink worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, K. 2005. The Karakoram Anomaly? Glacier expansion and the ‘elevation effect’, Karakoram Himalaya. Mountain Research and Development, Vol. 25, No. 4, pp. 332–40&lt;/ref&gt; Although the meltwater from these glaciers are increasing the total water supply for the present, the disappearance of glaciers in the long term will diminish available water resources. Increased meltwater due to rising global temperatures can also have negative effects such as flooding of lakes and dams and catastrophic results.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, K., 1982. Natural Dams and Outburst Floods of the Karakoram Himalaya. Proceedings of the Symposium on Hydrological Aspects of Alpine and High Mountain Areas. International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) Publication No. 138. Wallingford, UK, IAHS Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
[[File:Collecting clean water in rural Sindh (5367575654).jpg|thumb|right|In 2012 in [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]] a shortage of clean water led people to queue to collect it where available]]
Hydrologists today typically assess water scarcity by looking at the population-water equation. This is done by comparing the amount of total available water resources per year to the population of a country or region. A popular approach to measuring water scarcity has been to rank countries according to the amount of annual water resources available per person. For example, according to the Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/180.htm
 |title       = Climate Change 2001: Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a country or region is said to experience "water stress" when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic metres per person per year. At levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic metres per person per year, periodic or limited water shortages can be expected. When water supplies drop below 1,000 cubic metres per person per year, the country faces "water scarcity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations' [[FAO]] states that by 2025, 1.9 billion people will live in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/nr/water/issues/scarcity.html FAO Hot issues: Water scarcity]. Fao.org. Retrieved on 27 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank adds that [[climate change]] could profoundly alter future patterns of both water availability and use, thereby increasing levels of water stress and insecurity, both at the global scale and in sectors that depend on water.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank, 2009 {{cite web|url=http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/water-and-climate-change-understanding-risks-and-making-climate-smart-investment-decisi |title=Water and Climate Change: Understanding the Risks and Making Climate-Smart Investment Decisions |pages=21–24 |accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ways of measuring water scarcity include examining the physical existence of water in nature, comparing nations with lower or higher volumes of water available for use. This method often fails to capture the accessibility of the water resource to the population that may need it. Others have related water availability to population.

Another measurement, calculated as part of a wider assessment of water management in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Molden, D. (Ed). (2007) [http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Assessment/ ''Water for food, Water for life: A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture.''] Earthscan/IWMI.&lt;/ref&gt; aimed to relate water availability to how the resource was actually used. It therefore divided water scarcity into 'physical' and 'economic'. [[Physical water scarcity]] is where there is not enough water to meet all demands, including that needed for ecosystems to function effectively. Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed, such as when there is overdevelopment of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater. Water stress harms living things because every organism needs water to live.

===Renewable freshwater resources===
Renewable freshwater supply is a metric often used in conjunction when evaluating water scarcity. This metric is informative because it can describe the total available water resource each country contains. By knowing the total available water source, an idea can be gained about whether a country is prone to experiencing physical water scarcity. This metric has its faults in that it is an average; precipitation delivers water unevenly across the planet each year and annual renewable water resources vary from year to year. This metric also does not describe the accessibility of water to individuals, households, industries, or the government. Lastly, as this metric is a description of a whole country, it does not accurately portray whether a country is experiencing water scarcity. Canada and Brazil both have very high levels of available water supply, but still experience various water related problems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

It can be observed that tropical countries in Asia and Africa have low availability of freshwater resources.

The following table displays the average annual renewable freshwater supply by country including both surface-water and groundwater supplies.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.worldwater.org/datav7/data_table_1_total_renewable_freshwater_supply_by_country.pdf|title = Total Renewable Freshwater Supply, by Country|accessdate = 5 November 2013|website = The World's Water}}&lt;/ref&gt; This table represents data from the UN FAO AQUASTAT, much of which are produced by modeling or estimation as opposed to actual measurements.

==Water stress==
[[File:AfriqueStressHydrique2025.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|GEO-2000 estimate for 2025, 25 African countries are expected to suffer from water shortage or water stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GEO-2000 overview overview|url=http://www.unep.org/geo/GEO2000/pdfs/ov-e.pdf|website=unep.org|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[United Nations]] (UN) estimates that, of 1.4 billion cubic kilometers (1 quadrillion acre-feet) of water on [[Earth]], just 200,000 cubic kilometers (162.1 billion acre-feet) represent fresh water available for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/water/96-1746.pdf Texas Water Report: Going Deeper for the Solution]. Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts.&lt;/ref&gt;

More than one in every six people in the world is water stressed, meaning that they do not have sufficient access to potable water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those that are water stressed make up 1.1 billion people in the world and are living in developing countries. According to the Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a country or region is said to experience "water stress" when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic metres per person per year. At levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic meters per person per year, periodic or limited water shortages can be expected. When a country is below 1,000 cubic meters per person per year, the country then faces water scarcity . In 2006, about 700 million people in 43 countries were living below the 1,700 cubic metres per person threshold.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Water stress is ever intensifying in regions such as China, India, and Sub-Saharan Africa, which contains the largest number of water stressed countries of any region with almost one fourth of the population living in a water stressed country.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The world's most water stressed region is the Middle East with averages of 1,200 cubic metres of water per person.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In China, more than 538 million people are living in a water-stressed region. Much of the water stressed population currently live in river basins where the usage of water resources greatly exceed the renewal of the water source.

===Changes in climate===
Another popular opinion is that the amount of available freshwater is decreasing because of [[climate change]]. Climate change has caused receding glaciers, reduced stream and river flow, and shrinking lakes and ponds. Many aquifers have been over-pumped and are not recharging quickly. Although the total fresh water supply is not used up, much has become polluted, salted, unsuitable or otherwise unavailable for drinking, industry and agriculture. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Chartres, C. and Varma, S. ''Out of water. From Abundance to Scarcity and How to Solve the World’s Water Problems'' FT Press (USA), 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A New York Times article, "Southeast Drought Study Ties Water Shortage to Population, Not [[Global Warming]]", summarizes the findings of Columbia University researcher on the subject of the droughts in the American Southeast between 2005 and 2007. The findings published in the ''Journal of Climate'' say that the water shortages resulted from population size more than rainfall. Census figures show that Georgia’s population rose from 6.48 to 9.54 million between 1990 and 2007.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;Dean, Cornelia (2 October 2009) [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/02/science/earth/02drought.html Southeast Drought Study Ties Water Shortage to Population, Not Global Warming]. ''NY Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; After studying data from weather instruments, computer models, and tree ring measurements, they found that the droughts were not unprecedented and result from normal climate patterns and random weather events. "Similar droughts unfolded over the last thousand years", the researchers wrote, "Regardless of [[climate change]], they added, similar weather patterns can be expected regularly in the future, with similar results."&lt;ref name="nytimes1" /&gt; As the temperature increases, rainfall in the Southeast will increase but because of [[evaporation]] the area may get even drier. The researchers concluded with a statement saying that any rainfall comes from complicated internal processes in the atmosphere and are very hard to predict because of the large amount of variables.

==Water crisis==
When there is not enough [[potable water]] for a given population, the threat of a ''water crisis'' is realized.&lt;ref name="Freshwater: lifeblood of the planet"&gt;[http://c-faculty.chuo-u.ac.jp/~mikenix1/tlr/rsch/iss/water/Water%20Reading%20X.pdf Freshwater: lifeblood of the planet]. Peopleandplanet.net (11 November 2002). Retrieved on 27 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United Nations]] and other world organizations consider a variety of regions to have water crises of global concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=17551&amp;Cr=&amp;Cr1 |title=World water crisis worsened by corruption, repression: UN report |publisher=Un.org |date=20 February 2006 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060603001032/http://www.nrdc.org/international/summit/summit3.asp UN World Summit on Sustainable Development]. Released by NRDC at the World Summit for Sustainable Development, 29 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations, such as the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], argue that there are no water crises in such places, but steps must still be taken to avoid one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/english/newsroom/news/2003/15254-en.html "No global water crisis – but may developing countries will face water scarcity"]. FAO.org. 12 March 2003.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of water crisis===
There are several principal manifestations of the water crisis.
* Inadequate access to safe [[drinking water]] for about 885 million people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | publisher=WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation
 | title=Progress in Drinking-water and Sanitation: special focus on sanitation

 | page=25
 | url=http://www.unicef.org/media/files/Joint_Monitoring_Report_-_17_July_2008.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inadequate access to [[sanitation]] for 2.5 billion people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_44093.html |title=Updated Numbers: WHO-UNICEF JMP Report 2008 |publisher=Unicef.org |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which often leads to [[water pollution]]
* [[Groundwater]] [[overdrafting]] (excessive use) leading to diminished [[agriculture|agricultural]] yields&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.evergreen.edu/g/grossmaz/WORMKA/ |title=Water is Life – Groundwater drawdown |publisher=Academic.evergreen.edu |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Overuse and [[pollution]] of water resources harming [[biodiversity]]
* Regional conflicts over scarce water resources sometimes resulting in [[war]]fare.

[[Waterborne diseases]] caused by lack of [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. For children under age five, waterborne diseases are a leading cause of death. According to the [[World Bank]], 88 percent of all waterborne diseases are caused by unsafe drinking water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water is the underlying tenuous balance of safe water supply, but controllable factors such as the management and distribution of the water supply itself contribute to further scarcity.

A 2006 United Nations report focuses on issues of governance as the core of the water crisis, saying "There is enough water for everyone" and "Water insufficiency is often due to mismanagement, corruption, lack of appropriate institutions, bureaucratic inertia and a shortage of investment in both human capacity and physical infrastructure".&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001444/144409E.pdf Water, a shared responsibility. The United Nations World Water Development Report 2], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Official data also shows a clear correlation between access to safe water and GDP per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.gapminder.org/videos/gapcasts/gapcast-9-public-services/
 | title=Public Services
 | publisher=Gapminder video
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been claimed, primarily by economists, that the water situation has occurred because of a lack of property rights, government regulations and subsidies in the water sector, causing prices to be too low and consumption too high.&lt;ref&gt;Segerfeldt, Fredrik (25 August 2005), [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4462 "Private Water Saves Lives"], ''Financial Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zetland, David (1 August 2008) [http://aguanomics.com/2008/08/running-out-of-water.html "Running Out of Water"]. aguanomics.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zetland, David (14 July 2008) [http://aguanomics.com/2008/07/water-crisis.html "Water Crisis"]. aguanomics.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Vegetation and wildlife are fundamentally dependent upon adequate freshwater resources. [[Marsh]]es, [[bog]]s and [[riparian zone]]s are more obviously dependent upon sustainable water supply, but forests and other upland ecosystems are equally at risk of significant productivity changes as water availability is diminished. In the case of wetlands, considerable area has been simply taken from wildlife use to feed and house the expanding human population. But other areas have suffered reduced productivity from gradual diminishing of freshwater inflow, as upstream sources are diverted for human use. In seven states of the U.S. over 80 percent of all historic [[wetland]]s were filled by the 1980s, when Congress acted to create a "[[no net loss (wetlands)|no net loss]]" of wetlands.

In [[Europe]] extensive loss of wetlands has also occurred with resulting [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]]. For example, many bogs in [[Scotland]] have been developed or diminished through human population expansion. One example is the [[Portlethen Moss]] in [[Aberdeenshire]].

[[File:Madagascar highland plateau.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Deforestation in Madagascar|Deforestation of the Madagascar Highland Plateau]] has led to extensive [[siltation]] and unstable flows of western [[river]]s.]]

On [[Madagascar]]'s highland plateau, a massive transformation occurred that eliminated virtually all the heavily forested vegetation in the period 1970 to 2000. The [[slash and burn]] agriculture eliminated about ten percent of the total country's native biomass and converted it to a barren wasteland. These effects were from [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the necessity to feed poor indigenous peoples, but the adverse effects included widespread gully erosion that in turn produced heavily silted rivers that "run red" decades after the [[deforestation]]. This eliminated a large amount of usable fresh water and also destroyed much of the riverine ecosystems of several large west-flowing rivers. Several fish species have been driven to the edge of extinction and some, such as the disturbed Tokios [[coral reef]] formations in the [[Indian Ocean]], are effectively lost.
In October 2008, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman and former chief executive of Nestlé, warned that the production of biofuels will further deplete the world's water supply.

===Overview of regions suffering crisis impacts===
There are many other countries of the world that are severely impacted with regard to [[human]] [[health]] and inadequate drinking water. The following is a partial list of some of the countries with significant populations (numerical population of affected population listed) whose only consumption is of contaminated water:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/specialsession/about/sgreport-pdf/03_SafeDrinkingWater_D7341Insert_English.pdf Safe Drinking Water]. WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Sudan]] (12.3 million)
* [[Venezuela]] (5.0 million)
* [[Ethiopia]] (2.7 million)
* [[Tunisia]] (2.1 million)
* [[Cuba]] (1.3 million)

Water deficits, which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous smaller countries, may soon do the same in larger countries, such as [[Chinese water crisis|China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/HG21Df01.html |title=India grows a grain crisis |publisher=Atimes.com |date=21 July 2006 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water tables are falling in scores of countries (including Northern China, the US, and India) due to widespread overpumping using powerful diesel and electric pumps. Other countries affected include [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], and [[Mexico]]. This will eventually lead to water scarcity and cutbacks in grain harvest. Even with the overpumping of its [[aquifers]], China is developing a grain deficit. When this happens, it will almost certainly drive grain prices upward. Most of the 3 billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing water shortages. Unless population growth can be slowed quickly, it is feared that there may not be a practical non-violent or humane solution to the emerging world water shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/Seg/PB2ch03_ss6.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331153400/http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/Seg/PB2ch03_ss6.htm |archivedate=2009-03-31 |title=Water Scarcity Crossing National Borders |author=Brown, Lester R.|publisher=Earth Policy Institute|date=27 September 2006 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester R.

After China and India, there is a second tier of smaller countries with large water deficits — [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], Mexico, and Pakistan.

According to a UN climate report, the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] glaciers that are the sources of [[Asia]]'s biggest rivers – [[Ganges]], [[Indus]], [[Brahmaputra]], [[Yangtze]], [[Mekong]], [[Salween]] and [[Yellow]] – could disappear by 2035 as temperatures rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/42387/story.htm |title=Vanishing Himalayan Glaciers Threaten a Billion |publisher=Planetark.com |date=5 June 2007 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that the source used by the UN climate report actually stated 2350, not 2035.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8387737.stm|title=Himalayan glaciers melting deadline 'a mistake' |date=5 December 2009|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 December 2009|first=Pallava|last=Bagla}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 2.4 billion people live in the [[drainage basin]] of the Himalayan rivers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090215045754/http://www.peopleandplanet.net/pdoc.php?id=3024 Big melt threatens millions, says UN]. peopleandplanet.net. 4 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; India, China, Pakistan, [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and [[Myanmar]] could experience floods followed by droughts in coming decades.

==Outlook==
[[File:Madagascar well.jpg|thumb|Wind and solar power such as this installation in a village in northwest [[Madagascar]] can make a difference in safe water supply.]]

Construction of [[wastewater treatment]] plants and reduction of groundwater overdrafting appear to be obvious solutions to the worldwide problem; however, a deeper look reveals more fundamental issues in play. Wastewater treatment is highly [[capital intensive]], restricting access to this technology in some regions; furthermore the rapid increase in population of many countries makes this a race that is difficult to win. As if those factors are not daunting enough, one must consider the enormous costs and skill sets involved to maintain wastewater treatment plants even if they are successfully developed.

Reducing groundwater overdrafting is usually politically unpopular, and can have major economic impacts on farmers. Moreover, this strategy necessarily reduces crop output, something the world can ill-afford given the current population.

At more realistic levels, developing countries can strive to achieve primary wastewater treatment or secure [[septic system]]s, and carefully analyse wastewater outfall design to minimize impacts to drinking water and to ecosystems. Developed countries can not only share technology better, including cost-effective wastewater and water treatment systems but also in [[hydrological transport model]]ing. At the individual level, people in developed countries can look inward and reduce over consumption, which further strains worldwide water consumption. Both developed and developing countries can increase protection of ecosystems, especially wetlands and riparian zones. There measures will not only conserve [[biota (ecology)|biota]], but also render more effective the natural [[water cycle]] flushing and transport that make water systems more healthy for humans.

A range of local, low-tech solutions are being pursued by a number of companies. These efforts center around the use of solar power to distill water at temperatures slightly beneath that at which water boils. By developing the capability to purify any available water source, local business models could be built around the new technologies, accelerating their uptake. For example, Bedouins from the town of [[Dahab]] in Egypt have installed Aqua Danial's Water Stellar, which uses a solar thermal collector measuring two square meters to distill from 40 to 60 liters per day from any local water source. This is five times more efficient than conventional stills and eliminates the need for polluting plastic PET bottles or transportation of water supply.&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield, Barry (1 December 2012), http://www.barrymansfield.com/pdf/easyJet%20Traveller%20December%202012%20Egypt%20edition.pdf  ''easy Jet Traveler''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global experiences in managing water crisis==
{{Essay-like|date=September 2009|section}}

It is alleged that the likelihood of conflict rises if the rate of change within the basin exceeds the capacity of institution to absorb that change.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com" /&gt; Although water crisis is closely related to regional tensions, history showed that acute conflicts over water are far less than the record of cooperation.

The key lies in strong institutions and cooperation. The Indus River Commission and the Indus Water Treaty survived two wars between India and Pakistan despite their hostility, proving to be a successful mechanism in resolving conflicts by providing a framework for consultation inspection and exchange of data. The Mekong Committee has also functioned since 1957 and survived the Vietnam War. In contrast, regional instability results when there is an absence of institutions to co-operate in regional collaboration, like Egypt's plan for a high dam on the Nile. However, there is currently no global institution in place for the management and management of trans-boundary water sources, and international co-operation has happened through ad hoc collaborations between agencies, like the Mekong Committee which was formed due to an alliance between UNICEF and the US Bureau of Reclamation. Formation of strong international institutions seems to be a way forward – they fuel early intervention and management, preventing the costly dispute resolution process.

One common feature of almost all resolved disputes is that the negotiations had a "need-based" instead of a "right–based" paradigm. Irrigable lands, population, technicalities of projects define "needs". The success of a need-based paradigm is reflected in the only water agreement ever negotiated in the Jordan River Basin, which focuses in needs not on rights of riparians. In the Indian subcontinent, irrigation requirements of Bangladesh determine water allocations of the Ganges River. A need-based, regional approach focuses on satisfying individuals with their need of water, ensuring that minimum quantitative needs are being met. It removes the conflict that arises when countries view the treaty from a national interest point of view, move away from the zero-sum approach to a positive sum, integrative approach that equitably allocated the water and its benefits.

The Blue Peace framework developed by Strategic Foresight Group in partnership with the Governments of Switzerland and Sweden offers a unique policy structure which promotes sustainable management of water resources combined with cooperation for peace. By making the most of shared water resources through cooperation rather than mere allocation between countries, the chances for peace can be increased.&lt;ref&gt;''Turkish Review'', March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Blue Peace approach has proven to be effective in cases like the Middle East&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/40595Blue+Peace_Middle+East.pdf|title=Strategic Foresight Group - Anticipating and Influencing Global Future|website=www.strategicforesight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deza.admin.ch/en/Home/Projects/Selected_projects/Water_management_and_peace_promotion_in_the_Middle_East eda.base.components.templates.base.accessKeys].

'''''Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers''''' is a 1994 (2nd ed. 1998, 3rd ed. 2004) book by [[Stanford University]] biologist [[Robert Sapolsky|Robert M. Sapolsky]]. The book proclaims itself as a "Guide to Stress, Stress-Related Diseases, and Coping" on the front cover of its third and most recent edition. The title derives from Sapolsky's idea that for animals such as zebras, stress is generally episodic (e.g., running away from a lion), while for humans, stress is often chronic (e.g., worrying about losing your job). Therefore, many [[wild animals]] are less susceptible than humans to chronic [[stress-related disorders]] such as [[peptic ulcer|ulcers]], [[hypertension]], decreased [[neurogenesis]] and increased [[hippocampal]] neuronal atrophy.  However, chronic stress occurs in some social primates (Sapolsky studies baboons) for individuals on the lower side of the social dominance hierarchy.

Sapolsky focuses on the effects of [[glucocorticoids]] on the human body, stating that such hormones may be useful to animals in the wild escaping their predators, (see ''[[Fight-or-flight response]]'') but the effects on humans, when secreted at high quantities or over long periods of time, are much less desirable. Sapolsky relates the history of [[endocrinology]], how the field reacted at times of discovery, and how it has changed through the years. While most of the book focuses on the biological machinery of the body, the last chapter of the book focuses on self-help.

''Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers'' explains how social phenomena such as child abuse and the chronic stress of poverty affect biological stress, leading to increased risk of disease and disability.
