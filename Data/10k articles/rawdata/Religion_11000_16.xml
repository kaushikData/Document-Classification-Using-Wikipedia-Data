==Roman temple==
There are the ruins of a [[Roman temple]] in the village that are included in a group of [[Temples of Mount Hermon]]. The temple is situated on a hill with a commanding view of [[Mount Hermon]]. George F. Taylor classified it as an [[Antae temple]] of a rugged design that lacked decoration. He noted that the doorway of the temple does not face the summit, but instead aligns to a northerly area of the mountain that is covered by a ridge. A [[cult statue]] was suggested to have featured in the temple, of which only the framing columns have survived. Three sections of the east antae pillar were also still in place.&lt;ref name="Taylor1971"/&gt;

'''Saint Albinus of Angers''' ({{lang-fr|Saint-Aubin}}) (c. 470 – March 1, 550) was a French [[abbot]] and [[bishop]].  Born to a [[Nobility|noble]] [[Gallo-Roman]] family at [[Vannes]], [[Brittany]], St. Albinus was a [[monk]] and from 504 C.E. Abbot of Tintillac (which no longer stands; its location has not been satisfactorily identified).  His reputation spread during the twenty-five years in which he served as abbot. In 529, St. Albinus was elected, against his wishes, [[Bishop of Angers]].&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.catholic-forum.com/Saints/sainta77.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episcopate==
He campaigned against [[incestuous]] weddings, such as those that occurred between members of the nobility.&lt;ref name="catholic-forum.com"&gt;*[http://www.catholic-forum.com/Saints/sta77los.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in the Third Council of Orléans (538) after [[Childebert I|King Childebert]] granted permission for this council to take place.&lt;ref name="catholic-forum.com"/&gt; Albinus sought advice from [[Caesarius of Arles|St. Caesarius of Arles]] after seeing laxity in other bishops.

Tradition states that he helped all in distress, using diocesan funds to free hostages from pirates. Another tradition states that he clashed with King Childebert, who had imprisoned a woman called Etherie, from [[Douille]] near Angers. Unable to secure her release Albinus visited her in prison, and the soldier who tried to resist him fell dead at his feet. This so impressed the king that he allowed St. Albinus to bail her out.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.societe-jersiaise.org/whitsco/aubin1.htm "A Life of St. Aubin and His Times" by Rosemary Hampton]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legend relates that St. Albinus once prayed far into the night for some men imprisoned in the Tower of Angers.  Suddenly a great stone collapsed from the wall, allowing their escape.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.societe-jersiaise.org/whitsco/aubin6.htm Venantius Fortunatus "The Life of St. Aubin"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and burial==
St. Albinus died in 550 and was buried in the church of Saint-Pierre at Angers.  In 556, a church was dedicated to him and his body was buried in its [[crypt]]. Near this church an abbey arose, called ''Saint-Aubin''.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://chaucer.library.emory.edu/charters/html/index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration==
[[Image:Angers tour saint aubin.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Saint-Aubin, Angers.]]

[[Gregory of Tours|St. Gregory of Tours]] remarks on the cult of St. Albinus, which later became diffused in Germany, England, and Poland, making St. Albinus a popular saint during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.catholic-forum.com/SAINTS/sta77los.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Venantius Fortunatus|St. Venantius Fortunatus]], a near contemporary, wrote a life of this saint.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.societe-jersiaise.org/whitsco/aubin3.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Churches were dedicated to him right across the continent as far as Poland, and he was sometimes seen as the [[patron saint]] for protection from [[pirate]] attack. This may have been based on the tradition that he bought back parishioners who had been taken captive by pirates sailing up the [[Loire]] river. Later the tradition was reinforced by a miracle recorded in the 10th century, when the walled town of [[Guérande]], near the mouth of the [[Loire]], prayed to St. Albinus for help and found their attackers miraculously defeated.

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Nicholas Belfort]] notably wrote describing miracles performed at the tomb of St. Aubin after the year 1000 AD. Belfort was a Regular Canon in the monastery of St John the Baptist by the city of [[Soissons]].&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.societe-jersiaise.org/whitsco/aubin16.htm John Dodd "The Life of St. Aubin"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, his fame increased and many coastal villages chose Aubin as their patron saint. Presumably this is the reason why [[Saint Aubin, Jersey|St. Aubin]] in [[Jersey]] bears his name, preserving the name of an ancient chapel that has long since disappeared. St. Aubin is venerated there in the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church of [[St Aubin on the Hill]]. (See [[Saint-Aubin (disambiguation)|Saint-Aubin]] for other places named for him.)

St. Albinus' [[feast day]] is celebrated on March 1.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.catholiconline.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=389]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Benedicaria Altar.jpg|thumb|right|Benedicaria Altar]]
'''Benedicaria''', which means "''Way of Blessing''," is a relatively new term for a number of loosely related family-based folk traditions found throughout [[Italy]], most notably in southern Italy and [[Sicily]].  Though referred to by some as "[[Folk religion|Folk Magic]]" or even as "[[Witchcraft]]," the various Benedicaria Traditions are concerned almost exclusively with healing, cleansing, spirituality, and religious devotion.  

Benedicaria is also known as '''Benedicazione''' (Blessing) in the [[Cattolichese]] dialect, '''Benedica''' (blessed) in [[Catanian]], and '''Fa Lu Santuccio''' (''lit.'' "do a little holy thing") in [[Campania]].

Unlike practitioners of [[Stregheria]] and some practitioners of [[Stregoneria]], practitioners of Benedicaria consider themselves to be devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]], and the practices of Benedicaria are inextricably linked with Italian popular devotions found in [[Traditional Catholicism]].

== History of the term ==

Amongst Italian communities, there is generally no word for "Benedicaria," and often it is simply called "the things we do and have always done."  However, the word for a practitioner is ''Benedetto'' (for a male) or ''Benedetta'' (for a female), both of which mean "Blessed One."  In Giuseppe Tornatore's 2000 motion picture ''[[Malèna]]'', however, there is a scene where the older ladies of the village are exorcising Renato with [[Holy card|Holy Cards]] and praying Rosaries.  The boy's father sees this and says "Va fanculo cu la benedicaria!"  ("Go fuck off with the Benedicaria!"){{fact|date=October 2015}}

In the English language, the word ''Benedicaria'' itself first appeared in writing thanks to Sicilian-American author [[Vito Quattrocchi]], who self-published his book ''Sicilian Benedicaria: Magical Catholicism''.  Quattrocchi had already been a published author, with ''The Sicilian Blade'' (1993, Desert Publications) under his belt.  However, this move towards [[Self-publishing|self-publication]] on Quattrocchi's part has proven to be successful, and now the word ''Benedicaria'' is in common use {{says who|date=October 2015}}, at least throughout the internet, as a way of identifying these traditions of spiritual practices.

Along with Quattrocchi, another name associated with Benedicaria is that of Agostino Taumaturgo, a Roman Catholic priest who maintains Quattrocchi's website and whose book, ''The Things We Do: Ways of the Holy Benedetta'' was published in 2007.{{fact|date=October 2015}}

Discussions on the subject of Benedicaria could be found on the forums at the Stregoneria Italiana website (now inactive), whose membership consists of both Catholics and Pagans who work together to debunk the stereotypes prevalent regarding Italian culture and spirituality.  The discussion on this site also covers the subjects of Italian Folk Culture(i.e. Stregoneria, Fattura, etc.), [[Christian Magic]], and many other aspects of Italian language, food, history, politics, and culture.

== Practices of Benedicaria ==

Benedicaria is catch-all term for a number of family-based spiritual traditions with a great deal of flexibility, and as a result, the practices found in Benedicaria may vary from family to family and from individual to individual.  Amongst the more commonly known practices are the use of [[olive oil]] and/or eggs as a cure for the [[Malocchio]] or [[Evil eye|Evil Eye]], the use of [[candle]]s, the [[Rosary]], herbs, and Novenas in honor of the various [[Saints]].  According to the information given at the [http://benedicaria.8m.com Italian Benedicaria] website, most of the prayers used in Benedicaria are taken directly from Catholic prayerbooks.

The same [[sacramentals]] used in the [[Catholic Church]] are used in Benedicaria, whereby the sacramentals are never disrespected. However they are also used, to a small degree in stregoneria, where there is more of a grey area and therefore a practitioner may find themselves walking the fine line between the sacred and the profane or, stepping right into sacrilege.

One example of the [[sacramentals]] being used in Benedicaria is in the so-called "[[Exorcism]] of [[Anthony of Padua|Saint Anthony]]", wherein the practitioner holds a [[crucifix]] over the object which he or she wishes to exorcise, and says: "Behold the Cross of the Lord!  Begone, ye hostile powers!  The Lion of the tribe of [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]] hath triumphed, he who is the rod of [[David]]!"  This rite is found, in its entirety, within the pre-[[Vatican II]] Roman Catholic ''Rite of Solemn Exorcism'', known as [http://www.geocities.com/athaumaturgus/exorcismale.pdf ''Ritus Exorcizandi Obssessos a Daemonio'']{{dead link|date=October 2010|bot=AnomieBOT}}.  

In fact, nearly all of the Sacramentals used by Benedetti come from the Church in times before the [[Second Vatican Council]], and a number of practitioners care little or nothing for the changes that took place after that Council (which many Benedicaria-practitioners and even ordinary Catholics may have been a somewhat forced imposition of Northern European or [[Protestant]] ideologies on the rest of the world).

Another common practice is the use of eggs as a form of cleansing or to remove the Evil Eye.  In this exercise, the egg is washed, dried, and then covered in [[Holy Water]] while the practitioner prays over it, saying an [[Apostles' Creed]], an [[Lord's Prayer|Our Father]], and three [[Hail Mary]]s.  The egg is then rolled over the alleged victim's body in a loosely prescribed pattern, paying especial attention to any area which may feel the most pain; the egg is believed to absorb any negative energy.  After doing this with the egg for fifteen minutes, the egg is broken by throwing it in the toilet and flushing the remains.  

This is very similar to a practice found in Mexican [[Curanderismo]] and Filipino [[Pagtatawas]] which has the same objective, and it is also an example of a Catholic Sacramental being combined with a possible pre-Christian practice, with the latter being subordinated to the belief-system of Catholicism.

== Relationship with Stregheria and Stregoneria ==

There is much discussion on the subject of what exactly is entailed by the terms Benedicaria, Stregoneria, and Stregheria.  However, the one thing upon which all parties agree is that these three things are all different from one another.  In 2005, a poster on Mystic Wicks asked [[Raven Grimassi]] his opinion concerning Benedicaria, and Grimassi responded that he had read Quattrocchi's book, that it seemed authentic in the material it covered, and that it neither has nor claims any relationship with Italian Witchcraft.  In response to this, Quattrocchi expressed his thanks that all sides of the debate acknowledge Stregheria and Benedicaria as two entirely separate and unrelated practices.

The relationship between Stregoneria and Benedicaria is more confounded entirely since in their purest forms the two are completely distinct. However, most practitioners make use of elements from both traditions, and many practitioners were raised with or taught elements of both traditions, so much so that over the course of centuries, it has become impossible to tell where one ends and the other begins.  In many cases, even the practitioner herself is not certain as to the distinctions.

This confusion between the two practices became an object of contention between Rue Roselli and Vito Quattrocchi in May 2007, when Quattrocchi posted two videos on YouTube featuring an interview between himself and a sympathetic priest regarding the subject.  In these videos, the priest (a mutual friend of both Roselli and Quattrocchi) stressed the fact that Benedicaria is not witchcraft, that it is entirely separate from witchcraft, and that the practitioner of Benedicaria is generally a devout Catholic who makes no pretensions of being a witch.  Roselli cited the tendency of Benedetti to blend the two practices, which was not mentioned in the videos.  The videos have since been removed from YouTube, but this debate comes to show that the relationship between Benedicaria and Stregoneria is one of synthesis and convolution.

'''Brahacharanam''' is a sub-sect of the [[Iyer]] community of [[Tamil Brahmins]]. The word "Brahacharanam" is a corruption of the [[Sanskrit]] word '''Brhatcharanam''' ({{lang-sa|ब्रहतचरनम्}}). Many Brahacharanam follow the ''[[Advaita Vedanta]]'' philosophy propounded by [[Adi Shankara|Adi Sankaracharya]]. However, some Brahacharanam are stauchly Saivite unlike followers of Adi Sankaracharya, or else adhere to "Sivadvaita" so to speak. The Brahacharanams, along with the Vadamas, form the major portion of the [[Kerala Iyer]] community.

The Brahacharanams, like the Vadamas, have a distinctive martial tradition which differentiate them from other Iyer communities. Members of the community served as ''Senapatis'' or army commanders under the Chola kings [[Raja Raja Chola I]] and [[Rajendra Chola I]].

== Etymology ==
The word ''bruhat'' in [[Sanskrit]] means "great", "vast" or "significant" and the word ''charanam'' refers to feet. The name Brahacharanam can be thus literally translated as "feet of the greats" referring to the status of a Guru, and the Brahacharanam being those who follow in the footsteps of the Greats.

== Origins ==
Their exact origins are not clear but their presence in the [[Tamil Kingdoms]] extends back at least to the reign of [[Parantaka Chola II]], who is said to have ''brahmarayars'' as ministers. Many of the agraharam villages of the Brahacharanam also have very ancient origins.

According to some, they made their way into the Tamil country through the [[Satyamangalam]] Pass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coimbatore.com/kongunadu/home.htm Kongunadu]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sub-groups ==
The Brahacharanam are divided into the following subgroups:{{cn|date=May 2017}}
* [[Kandramanickam]]
* Milanganur
* Mangudi
* Malanadu
* [[Palamaneri Iyers|Pazhamaneri]]
* Musanadu
* Kolathur
* Marudancheri
* Mazhavanattu
* Sathyamangalam and
* Puthur Dravida.

A significant number of Brahacharanams have migrated to [[Kerala]], where they are part of the Kerala Iyer community. They have also migrated in large numbers to [[Puttur, Andhra Pradesh|Puttur]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]] where they form the Puthur Dravida community.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

== Culture ==
Most Brahacharanam are worshippers of Shiva, and they cover their forehead with [[sacred ashes]]. Some used to wear Vibhuti in the Shape of the [[Sivalinga]] on their foreheads due their strong adherence to Lord Siva and no other. However, the Sathyamangalam group have some members who wear the [[vaishnava]] mark.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

Women also dress like other Iyers. In the ancient times, the cloth worn by the women used to be of little more than a knee's length. Among the Milaganur Brahacharanam, the Adrishya Pondugal ceremony is celebrated in which four women, a widow and a bachelor are invited to a feast. This was done in order to propitate four women who disappeared due to the ill treatment of their mothers in law.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

It has been documented that some Bracharanam who lived in places like Mangudi were such rigid saivaites that they would not even utter Govinda's name and lived a life of stern austerity.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

== Traditional role ==

The traditional function of Brahacharanams is to study and impart Vedic knowledge or officiate as priests in religious functions. However, there is evidence that in ancient times, they might have also served in the army or in civil and administrative services. During the Chola period, members of the community (especially the Pazhamaneri Brahacharanam) even served as army commanders. Senapathi [[Krishnan Raman]] was the Commander-in-chief of the Imperial Chola army of [[Rajendra Chola I]].&lt;ref name=" brahmarayar"&gt;{{cite book | first= K.A| last=[[K.A.

The '''Diocese of Skálholt''' is a suffragan diocese of the [[Church of Iceland]]. It was the estate of the first bishop in Iceland, Isleifr Gizurarson, who became bishop in 1056. (Christianity had been formally adopted in 1000). His son, Gizurr, donated it to become the official see. The Diocese was amalgamated in 1801, and now forms part of the Diocese of Iceland under the leadership of the [[Bishop of Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;http://nat.is/travelguideeng/plofin_skalholt.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jeanscape.com/skalholt/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 the diocese was restored as a suffragan see, with the Bishop of Skálholt, being a suffragan bishop to the [[Bishop of Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skalholt.is/en/skalholtsstadur/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cannabis sidebar}}
[[Cannabis (drug)|Cannabis]] has been used in an [[entheogenic]] context—a [[chemical substance]] used in a [[religion|religious]], [[shamanism|shamanic]], or [[spirituality|spiritual]] context&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brazilian Archives of Biology and Technology - Jurema-Preta (Mimosa tenuiflora [Willd.] Poir.): a review of its traditional use, phytochemistry and pharmacology |publisher=scielo.br |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1516-89132008000500010&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en |accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;—in the [[Indian subcontinent]] since the [[Vedic period]] dating back to approximately 1500 BCE, but perhaps as far back as 2000 BCE. Cannabis has been used by shamanic and pagan cultures to ponder deeply religious and philosophical subjects related to their tribe or society, to achieve a form of enlightenment, to unravel unknown facts and realms of the human mind and subconscious, and also as an [[aphrodisiac]] during rituals or orgies.&lt;ref&gt;Sayin, H.

[[Herodotus]] wrote about early ceremonial practices by the [[Scythians]], thought to have occurred from the 5th to 2nd century BCE. Itinerant [[Hindu saints]] have used it in the Indian subcontinent for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloomquist|first=Edward|title=Marijuana: The Second Trip|year=1971|publisher=Glencoe|location=California}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last few decades hundreds of archaeological and anthropological items of evidence have come out of Mexican, Mayan and Aztec cultures that suggest cannabis, along with [[Psilocybin mushroom|magic mushroom]]s (psilocybin), [[peyote]] (mescaline) and other [[psychoactive plant]]s were used in cultural shamanic and religious rituals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sayin, H.

The earliest known reports regarding the sacred status of cannabis in the [[Indian subcontinent]] come from the [[Atharva Veda]] estimated to have been written sometime around 2000–1400 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Forces of Habit: Drugs and the Making of the Modern World |last= Courtwright |first= David |year= 2001 |publisher= Harvard Univ.

The [[Vedas]] also refer to it as a "source of happiness," "joy-giver" and "liberator," and in the ''Raja Valabba'', the gods send hemp to the human race so that they might attain delight, lose fear and have sexual desires. Many households in India own and grow a cannabis plant to be able to offer cannabis to a passing ''[[sadhu]]'' (ascetic holy men), and during some evening devotional services it is not uncommon for cannabis to be smoked by everyone present.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Touw, M. (1981). The religious and medicinal uses of Cannabis in China, India and Tibet. ''Journal of psychoactive drugs'', ''13''(1), 23-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Naga Sadhu Smoking Ganja - Gangasagar Fair Transit Camp - Kolkata 2013-01-12 2573.JPG|thumb|A ''sadhu'', or holy person, smoking cannabis in [[Kolkata]], [[India]].]]
Cannabis was often consumed in weddings or festivals honoring [[Shiva]], who is said to have brought it down from the [[Himalayas]]. It is still offered to Shiva in temples on [[Shivaratri]] day, while devotional meetings called ''[[bhajan]]s'', although not necessarily associated with Shiva, are occasions for devotees to consume the drug liberally. ''[[Yogi]]s'' or ''sadhus'' along with other Hindu mystics have been known to smoke a mixture of ''cannabis sativa'' and tobacco in order to enhance meditation. This is particularly common during the festival of [[Diwali]] and [[Kumbha Mela]].&lt;ref&gt;Warf, B. (2014), High Points: An Historical Geography of Cannabis. Geogr Rev, 104: 414-438. doi:10.1111/j.1931-0846.2014.12038.x&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
There are three types of cannabis used in the Indian subcontinent. The first, ''[[bhang]]'', a type of [[cannabis edible]], consists of the leaves and plant tops of the [[marijuana]] plant. It is usually consumed as an infusion in beverage form, and varies in strength according to how much cannabis is used in the preparation. The second, ganja, consisting of the leaves and the plant tops, is smoked. The third, called ''[[charas]]'' or ''[[hashish]]'', consists of the resinous buds and/or extracted resin from the leaves of the marijuana plant. Typically, ''bhang'' is the most commonly used form of cannabis in religious festivals.
	 
In [[Tantric Buddhism]], which originated in the [[Tibet|TIbeto-Himalayan region]], cannabis serves as an important part of a traditional ritual (which may or may not also include sexual intercourse). Cannabis is taken to facilitate meditation and also heighten awareness of all aspects of the ceremony, with a large oral dosage being taken in time with the ceremony so that the climax of the "high" coincides with the climax of the ceremony.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Ancient China==
{{main|Hallucinogenic plants in Chinese herbals}}
	 
The sinologist and historian [[Joseph Needham]] concluded "the hallucinogenic properties of hemp were common knowledge in Chinese medical and Taoist circles for two millennia or more",&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham and Gwei-djen Lu (1974). ''Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology; Part 2, Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Magisteries of Gold and Immortality''. Cambridge University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTHGp0euKmoC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;lpg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 152]&lt;/ref&gt; and other scholars associated Chinese ''[[Wu (shaman)|wu]]'' (shamans) with the entheogenic use of cannabis in Central Asian [[shamanism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Before the Christian Era" from {{cite web |url=http://www.biology-online.org/articles/history_cannabis_medicine_review/christian_era.html |title=History of cannabis as a medicine: a review |author=Zuardi AW |date=June 2006 |work=Rev. Bras. Psiquiatr. vol.28 no.2 São Paulo |accessdate=2009-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
The oldest texts of [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] listed herbal uses for cannabis and noted some psychodynamic effects. The (ca. 100 CE) Chinese pharmacopeia ''[[Shennong Ben Cao Jing]]'' (''Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica'') described the use of ''mafen'' 麻蕡 "cannabis fruit/seeds":
{{quote|To take much makes people see demons and throw themselves about like maniacs (多食令人見鬼狂走). But if one takes it over a long period of time one can communicate with the spirits, and one's body becomes light (久服通神明輕身).&lt;ref&gt;Needham and Lu (1974), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTHGp0euKmoC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 150].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare "if taken in excess will produce visions of devils … over a long term, it makes one communicate with spirits and lightens one's body", {{cite journal |author=Li Hui-Lin |title=Hallucinogenic plants in Chinese herbals |journal=J Psychedelic Drugs |year=1978 |volume=10 | issue = 1 |pages=17–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
	 
A Taoist priest in the fifth century A.D. wrote in the ''Ming-I Pieh Lu'' that:
{{quote|Cannabis is used by necromancers, in combination with ginseng to set forward time in order to reveal future events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;}}

Later pharmacopia repeated this description, for instance the (ca. 1100 CE) ''Zhenglei bencao'' 證類本草 ("Classified Materia Medica"):
{{quote|If taken in excess it produces hallucinations and a staggering gait. If taken over a long term, it causes one to communicate with spirits and lightens one's body.&lt;ref&gt;Li Hui-Lin (1973). "The Origin and Use of Cannabis in Eastern Asia: Linguistic-Cultural Implications", ''Economic Botany'' 28.3:293-301, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
	 
The (ca. 730) dietary therapy book ''Shiliao bencao'' 食療本草 ("Nutritional Materia Medica") prescribes daily consumption of cannabis in the following case: "those who wish to see demons should take it (with certain other drugs) for up to a hundred days."

[[File:YangshaoCordmarkedAmphoraBanpoPhase4800BCEShaanxi.jpg|thumb|[[Yangshao culture]] (ca. 4800 BCE) [[amphora]] with hemp cord design]]
Cannabis has been cultivated in China since [[Neolithic]] times, for instance, hemp cords were used to create the characteristic line designs on [[Yangshao culture]] pottery). Early [[Chinese classics]] have many references to using the plant for clothing, fiber, and food, but none to its psychotropic properties. Some researchers think Chinese associations of cannabis with "indigenous central Asian shamanistic practices" can explain this "peculiar silence".&lt;ref&gt;Touw, Mia (1981). [http://www.mvcc.edu/~phirsch/Touw.pdf "The Religious and Medicinal Uses of ''Cannabis'' in China, India, and Tibet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718205155/http://www.mvcc.edu/~phirsch/Touw.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }}, ''Journal of Psychoactive Drugs'' 13.1:23-34, p 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The botanist [[Li Hui-lin]] noted linguistic evidence that the "stupefying effect of the hemp plant was commonly known from extremely early times"; the word ''ma'' "cannabis; hemp" has connotations of "numbed; tingling; senseless" (e.g., ''mamu'' 麻木 "numb" and ''mazui'' 麻醉 "anesthetic; narcotic"), which "apparently derived from the properties of the fruits and leaves, which were used as infusions for medicinal purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Li (1973), p. 297-298.&lt;/ref&gt; Li suggested shamans in [[Northeast Asia]] transmitted the medical and spiritual uses of cannabis to the ancient Chinese ''wu'' [[Wikt:巫|巫]] "shaman; spirit medium; doctor".

{{quote|The use of Cannabis as an hallucinogenic drug by necromancers or magicians is especially notable. It should be pointed out that in ancient China, as in most early cultures, medicine has its origin in magic. Medicine men were practicing magicians. In northeastern Asia, shamanism was widespread from Neolithic down to recent times. In ancient China shamans were known as ''wu''. This vocation was very common down to the Han dynasty. After that it gradually diminished in importance, but the practice persisted in scattered localities and among certain peoples. In the far north, among the nomadic tribes of Mongolia and Siberia, shamanism was widespread and common until rather recent times.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Hui-Lin. 1974. "An Archaeological and Historical Account of Cannabis in China", ''Economic Botany'' 28.4:437-448, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Robert Clarke and Mark Merlin, the authors of ''Cannabis: Evolution and Ethnobotany'', suggest that:
{{quote|After the rise of Confucianism, which spread from China through East Asia to Japan, the ingestion of cannabis resin for psychoactive, ritualistic purification was eventually suppressed in Japan, as it was in China.&lt;ref&gt;Warf, B. (2014), High Points: An Historical Geography of Cannabis. Geogr Rev, 104: 414-438. doi:10.1111/j.1931-0846.2014.12038.x&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Ancient Central Asia==	 
Both early Greek history and modern archeology show that [[Central Asian]] peoples were utilizing cannabis 2,500 years ago.
	 
The (ca. 440 BCE) Greek [[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'']] of [[Herodotus]] record the early [[Scythians]] using cannabis steam baths.
{{quote|[T]hey make a booth by fixing in the ground three sticks inclined towards one another, and stretching around them woollen felts, which they arrange so as to fit as close as possible: inside the booth a dish is placed upon the ground, into which they put a number of red-hot stones, and then add some hemp-seed. … The Scythians, as I said, take some of this hemp-seed, and, creeping under the felt coverings, throw it upon the red-hot stones; immediately it smokes, and gives out such a vapour as no Grecian vapour-bath can exceed; the Scyths, delighted, shout for joy, and this vapour serves them instead of a water-bath; for they never by any chance wash their bodies with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.4.iv.html|author=Herodotus|title=Histories}} 4.75&lt;/ref&gt;}}

What Herodotus called the "hemp-seed" must have been the whole flowering tops of the plant, where the psychoactive resin is produced along with the fruit ("seeds").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=As the seeds of cannabis contain no psycho-active chemicals, it is believed the Scythians were actually casting cannabis flowers onto the stones.|first=Martin|last=Booth|title=Cannabis: A History|publisher=Picador|year=2005|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herodotus also noted that the Thracians, a people who had intimate contact with the Scythians, introduced the plant to the Dacians where it became popular among a shamanic cult named the ''Kapnobatai'', or "Those Who Walk in the Clouds." The shamans of the cult, also called ''Kapnobatai'', were known to use hemp smoke to induce visions and trances.

Burial tombs of the Phrygians and Scythians frequently contained ''cannabis sativa'' seeds.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Warf, B. (2014), High Points: An Historical Geography of Cannabis. Geogr Rev, 104: 414-438. doi:10.1111/j.1931-0846.2014.12038.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the [[Tarim mummies]] excavated near [[Turpan]] in [[Xinjiang]] province of Northwestern China were buried with sacks of cannabis next to their heads.&lt;ref name="peoplesdaily"&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200612/23/eng20061223_335258.html|title=Lab work to identify 2,800-year-old mummy of shaman|publisher=People's Daily Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on additional [[grave goods]], archaeologists concluded these individuals were [[Wu (shaman)|shamans]]: "The marijuana must have been buried with the dead shamans who dreamed of continuing the profession in another world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ce.cn/National/culture/200701/26/t20070126_10220745.shtml|title=Perforated skulls provide evidence of craniotomy in ancient China|publisher=China Economic Net|date=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team of scientists analyzed one shamanistic tomb that contained a leather basket with well-preserved cannabis (789&amp;nbsp;grams of leaves, shoots, and fruits; [[Accelerator mass spectrometry|AMS]] dated 2475 ± 30 years BP) and a wooden bowl with cannabis traces. Lacking any "suitable evidence that the ancient, indigenous people utilized ''Cannabis'' for food, oil, or fiber", they concluded "the deceased was more concerned with the intoxicant and/or medicinal value of the ''Cannabis'' remains."&lt;ref name="jiang2006a"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hong-En Jiang|year=2006|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T8D-4K7WC0F-2&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=12%2F06%2F2006&amp;_rdoc=17&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235084%232006%23998919996%23636769%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&amp;_cdi=5084&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=23&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=3e6ac8940b4b86b94935cd7a7d7bc19d|title=A new insight into ''Cannabis sativa'' (Cannabaceae) utilization from 2500-year-old Yanghai tombs, Xinjiang, China|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|volume=108|issue=3|pages=414–422|doi=10.1016/j.jep.2006.05.034|pmid=16879937|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese archaeologist Hongen Jiang and his colleagues excavated a circa 2,400-2,800 BP tomb in northwest China’s [[Turpan Basin]] and found the remains of an approximately 35-year-old man with Caucasian features who had been buried with thirteen 1-meter cannabis plants, placed diagonally across his chest. Jiang said this is the first archeological discovery of complete cannabis plants, as well as the first incidence of their use as a burial [[shroud]].&lt;ref&gt;Hongen Jiang et al. (2016), "Ancient ''Cannabis'' Burial Shroud in a Central Eurasian Cemetery", ''Economic Botany'' 70.3: 213-221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kristin Romey, [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/marijuana-cannabis-pot-weed-burial-shroud-china-ancient-discovery-scythians-turpan-archaeology-botany/ Ancient Cannabis 'Burial Shroud' Discovered in Desert Oasis], ''National Geographic'', 4 October 2016. &lt;/ref&gt;

Cannabis may be associated with [[Central Asian]] burial rituals in around 5th Century B.C., as archaeological excavations in 1947 of a series of burial mounds at Pazyryk in the Altai Mountains of Siberia revealed 1.2 meter-high wooden frame tents in each of the mounds. Each frame surrounded a bronze vessel filled with the remains of hemp seeds and stones, and were presumably left smoking in the grave. In one of the mounds, a leather pouch containing hemp seeds, and scattered hemp, coriander, and melilotus seeds were also recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Merlin M. D. Archaeological evidence for the tradition of psychoactive plant use in the old world. Economic Botany, 2003; 57(3): 295–323.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Africa==
According to [[Alfred Dunhill]] (1924), Africans have had a long tradition of smoking hemp in gourd pipes, asserting that by 1884 the King of the Baluka tribe of the Congo had established a "riamba" or hemp-smoking cult in place of fetish-worship. Enormous gourd pipes were used.&lt;ref name=Dunhill&gt;[Dunhill, Alfred | "The Pipe Book" | London | A &amp; C Black, 1924]&lt;/ref&gt; Cannabis was used in Africa to restore appetite and relieve pain of hemorrhoids. It was also used as an antiseptic. In a number of countries, it was used to treat tetanus, hydrophobia, delirium tremens, infantile convulsions, neuralgia and other nervous disorders, cholera, menorrhagia, rheumatism, hay fever, asthma, skin diseases, and protracted labor during childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/nc/nc1a.htm |title=History of Marihuana Use: Medical and Intoxicant |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Africa, there were a number of cults and sects of hemp worship. Pogge and Wissman, during their explorations of 1881, visited the Bashilenge, living on the northern borders of the Lundu, between Sankrua and Balua. They found large plots of land around the villages used for the cultivation of hemp. Originally there were small clubs of hemp smokers, bound by ties of friendship, but these eventually led to the formation of a religious cult. The Bashilenge called themselves ''[[Bena Riamba]]'', "the sons of hemp", and their land Lubuku, meaning friendship. They greeted each other with the expression "''moio''", meaning both "hemp" and "life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCRNRGOhNA4C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=Bashilenge&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VDjj80Qz0X&amp;sig=R2Rf8r2X_6NWUlm-B0oSxl_53cg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1BL_ULD3EIP2igLKwIHgBg&amp;ved=0CGoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Bashilenge&amp;f=false|title=Cannabis and Culture|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Each tribesman was required to participate in the cult of Riamba and show his devotion by smoking as frequently as possible. They attributed universal magical powers to hemp, which was thought to combat all kinds of evil and they took it when they went to war and when they traveled. There were initiation rites for new members which usually took place before a war or long journey. The hemp pipe assumed a symbolic meaning for the Bashilenge somewhat analogous to the significance which the peace pipe had for American Indians. No holiday, no trade agreement, no peace treaty was transacted without it. In the middle Sahara region, the [[Senusi]] sect also cultivated hemp on a large scale for use in religious ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Wissman et al. 1888&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germanic paganism==
In ancient [[Germanic paganism]], cannabis was associated with the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] love goddess, [[Freya]].&lt;ref name="pilcher"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pilcher|first=Tim|title=Spliffs 3: The Last Word in Cannabis Culture?|year=2005|page=34|publisher=Collins &amp; Brown Publishers| ISBN= 978-1-84340-310-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vindheim|first=Jan Bojer|url=http://www.vindheim.net/hamp/hemp.html|title=The History of Hemp in Norway|work=The Journal of Industrial Hemp|publisher=International Hemp Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The harvesting of the plant was connected with an erotic [[religious festival|high festival]].&lt;ref name="pilcher" /&gt; It was believed that Freya lived as a fertile force in the plant's feminine flowers and by ingesting them one became influenced by this divine force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rätsch|first=Christian|title=The Sacred Plants of our Ancestors|work=[[Tyr (journal)|TYR: Myth—Culture Tradition]]|volume=2|date=2003–2004|ISBN=0-9720292-1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistics offers further evidence of prehistoric use of cannabis by Germanic peoples: The word ''hemp'' derives from Old English ''hænep'', from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''hanapiz'', from the same Scythian word that ''cannabis'' derives from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hemp |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology of this word follows [[Grimm's Law]] by which Proto-Indo-European initial ''*k-'' becomes ''*h-'' in Germanic. The shift of *k→h indicates it was a loanword into the [[Germanic Parent Language|Germanic parent language]] at a time depth no later than the separation of Common Germanic from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], about 500 BC.

The [[Celts]] may have also used cannabis, as evidence of [[hashish]] traces were found in [[Hallstatt]], birthplace of Celtic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Creighton|first=John|title=Coins and Power in Late Iron Age Britain|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2000|page=52| ISBN= 978-0-521-77207-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Bad citation; article mentions neither hashish nor Hallstatt. --&gt;
Also, the [[Dacians]] and the [[Scythians]] had a tradition where a fire was made in an inclosed space and cannabis seeds were burnt and the resulting smoke ingested.

== Middle East ==
There exist reports that cannabis was ritually consumed by a Sufi sect called ''Melamis'', and also in the cult of ''Hassan Sabbah'', or the ''Hashshashin''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Assyrians, Egyptians, and Hebrews, among other Semitic cultures of the Middle East, mostly acquired cannabis from Aryan cultures and have burned it as an incense as early as 1000 BC.

In Egypt, cannabis pollen was recovered from the tomb of Ramses II, who governed for sixty‐seven years during the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; dynasty, and several mummies contain trace cannabinoids. 

Cannabis oil was likely used throughout the Middle East for centuries before and after the birth of Christ. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is mentioned in the original Hebrew Old Testament and in its Aramaic translations as both incense and as intoxicant. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cannabis, as an incense, was used in the temples of Assyria and Babylon because "its aroma was pleasing to the Gods."

In Exodus 30:23 of the Bible, God directed Moses to make a holy oil composed of “myrrh, sweet cinnamon, kaneh bosm and kassia”. The root ''kan'' has two meanings in many Ancient languages; hemp and reed. In numerous translations of the original Hebrew Bible, ''kaneh bosm'' has been erroneously translated as “calamus” or “aromatic reed,” when the actual translation is closer to hemp. This error appears in translations as early as the third century B.C in Septuagint, the oldest Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, and also appears in following translations such as Martin Luther’s. &lt;ref&gt;Benet, S. (1975). Early Diffusion and Folk Uses of Hemp. ''Cannabis and culture'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3823">{{For|a broader description about communication from deity|revelation}}

In [[theology]], '''general revelation''', or '''natural revelation''', refers to knowledge about [[God]] and [[spirit]]ual matters, discovered through natural means, such as observation of [[nature]] (the [[physical universe]]), [[philosophy]] and reasoning. [[Christian theology|Christian theologians]] use the term to describe knowledge of God purported to be plainly available to all mankind. General revelation is usually understood to pertain to outward temporal events that are experienced within the world or the physical universe. The definition may be extended to include human [[conscience]] or [[Divine providence|providence]] or providential history. 

==Characteristics==
General revelation is a form of revelation that gives knowledge through experience or records of [[history]], [[Creation myth|creation]], and innate [[conscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, John &amp; Crawford, Tommy; "General Revelation" -  basictheology.com, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120211210929/http://www.basictheology.com/definitions/General_Revelation/ Archive of Basic Theology.com - "General Revelation"]&lt;/ref&gt; Christian theologians cite [[Bible|biblical]] references to support general revelation: [[s:Bible (King James)/Romans#1:20|Romans 1:20]], [[s:Bible (King James)/Psalms#Psalm 19|Psalms 19:1-6]], and [[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#5:45|Matthew 5:45]]. General revelation shows the works and existence of God in indirect ways. 

General revelation is experienced through:
# ''Physical Universe'' - The laws and nature of the physical universe as it transpires are interpreted as displaying God's attributes of existence, knowledge, wisdom, power, order, greatness, supremacy, righteousness, and goodness.
# ''Human Conscience'' - God has instilled the innate ability in all persons to discern the difference between right and wrong, to choose and act on that discernment and judgment according to [[free will]] and conscience, and to experience guilt when the act or choice is wrong. One of the [[arguments for the existence of God]] is based on the moral sense in humans.
# ''Providence'' refers to the sustaining power of God. Providence is defined as "divine providence; proceeding from divine direction or superintendence; as the providential contrivance of things; as a providential escape from danger."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1828-dictionary.com/d/search/word,providential Providential] from Webster's 1828 Dictionary, Electronic Version by Christian Technologies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

General revelation is understood as the everyday experience of life, but is solely dependent on  interpretation of those experiences as comprehending God's hand in external events or things. 

General revelation is distinguished from [[special revelation]] and [[direct revelation]]. The former refers to the knowledge of God and spiritual matters which can be discovered through [[supernatural]] means, such as [[scripture]] or [[miracle]]s, and the latter refers to direct communication from God to a person.

'''Hermann Struck ''' (6 March 1876 – 11 January 1944) was a [[German Jewish]] artist known for his etchings.&lt;ref name="lbi"&gt;[http://www.lbi.org/exhibitions.html Exhibitions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Land Israel by Hermann Struck (5058192938).jpg|thumb|Jaffa]]
 
Hermann Struck (Chaim Aaron ben David) was born in [[Berlin]]. He studied at the Berlin Academy of Fine Arts. In 1904, he joined the [[modern art]] movement known as the [[Berlin Secession]].&lt;ref name="lbi"/&gt;
In 1900, Struck met [[Jozef Israëls]], a Dutch artist, who became his mentor. Both were recognized as leading artists of their time.&lt;ref name="hat"&gt; "Here and There" Smadar Sheffi, ''Haaretz Guide'', March 7, 2008, review of Herman Struck retrospective: Master Print Maker,Open Museum, Tefen Industrial Park, Israel&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, Struck published "Die Kunst des Radierens" ("The Art of Etching"), which became a seminal work on the subject.&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt;It was a textbook that offered both theory and practical instruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mushecht.haifa.ac.il/art/Artist-Collection-eng.aspx?id=40 Hecht Museum: Hermann Struck]&lt;/ref&gt;Struck's students included [[Marc Chagall]], [[Lovis Corinth]], [[Jacob Steinhardt]], [[Lesser Ury]] and [[Max Liebermann]].&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt;
[[File:Hermann Struck Grafik JMBerlin GDR 87 2 0.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Theodore Herzl]]]]

In 1899, upon completing his studies at the Berlin Academy, he was banned from teaching there because he was Jewish. He signed his work with his Hebrew name, Chaim Aaron ben David, and a [[Star of David]].&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt;{{dubious|The Jaffa etching shown here is signed "Struck" and bears a red emblem (stamp?) "HS". Maybe there is also "Chaim Aaron ben David" written smaller somewhere. Anyway, NOT an accurate statement. Also, the Herzl portrait is signed "Hermann Struck fecit" on the margin, and there is a ''shin'' and a Star of David inside the picture.|date=January 2017}} Struck did commissioned portraits of [[Ibsen]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Freud]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Theodor Herzl|Herzl]], [[Oscar Wilde]] and other leading figures of the time.&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt;

Struck was a fervent [[Zionist]] and Jewish activist. He visited the [[Land of Israel]] in 1903, displayed his art at the Fifth [[Zionist Congress]], and was a founder of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi Religious Zionist movement]]. At the same time, he was a German patriot and volunteered for military service in World War I&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt; serving as a translator, liaison officer and military artist.&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt; He was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 1st Class and promoted to an officer for bravery, in 1917 he became the referent for Jewish affairs at the [[Ober Ost|German Eastern Front High Command]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwRouKYzapsC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=wilhelm+von+gayl&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=gayl&amp;f=false|title=The art and artists of the fifth Zionist Congress, 1901: heralds of a new age|accessdate=2009-08-25 |work= |publisher= Gilya Gerda Schmidt |year=2003 |date= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Struck immigrated to Palestine in 1922, taught at [[Bezalel Academy]] and helped establish the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt; He visited Berlin every summer until the Nazis rose to power.&lt;ref name="hat"/&gt;

About 22.6% of the population of [[Bhutan]] are [[Hindus]]&lt;ref name="pew2010"&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/12/globalReligion-tables.pdf Pew Research Center - Global Religious Landscape 2010 - religious composition by country].&lt;/ref&gt;.It is followed mainly by the ethnic  [[Lhotshampa]] . In 2015 ,Hinduism became one  of the national religion of country.

The [[Shaivite]], [[Vaishnavite]], [[Shakta]], [[Ganapathi]], [[Puranic]], and [[Vedas|Vedic]] schools are represented among Hindus. Hindu temples exist in southern Bhutan, and Hindus practice their religion in small- to medium-sized groups.

==Festival==

[[File:Tika and jamara.jpg|thumb|The [[tilaka]] (in red) and jamara used during Dashain]]
The main festival of bhutanese hindus is [[Dashain]].
It is the only recognized Hindu public holiday in Bhutan.It was recognized as a holiday in 2015 by the King of Bhutan,he also celebrated [[Dashain]] with [[Hindus]] that year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hinduismtoday.com/blogs-news/hindu-press-international/the-king-of-bhutan-celebrates-with-hindus/11574.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbs.bt/news/?p=53990&lt;/ref&gt;.The first nine days of Dashain symbolize the battle which took place between the different manifestations of [[Durga]] and [[Mahishasura]]. The tenth day is the day when Durga finally defeated him. For other Hindus, this festival symbolizes the victory of Ram over
Ravan as recounted in the [[Ramayana]]. They also prepare [[Sel roti]] during [[Dashain]].

==Hindu Dharma Samudaya==
The [[Hindu Dharma Samudaya of Bhutan (HDSB)]] is the Hindu religious organization, established in 2009. It is registered with the [[Chhoedey Lhentshog]], the Commission for Religious Organizations of Bhutan. HDSB is dedicated to promote spiritual traditions and practices of Sanathan Dharma in Bhutan so to foster and strengthen human values.Its head office in the capital city, [[Thimphu]], the organization is managed by a Board of Directors of volunteers comprising representatives from Hindu priests and other HDSB members who are elected at an annual general meeting.

==Persecution of Hindus==
{{main article|Ethnic cleansing in Bhutan}}
Etnic cleansing of Lhotshampas hindus carried out by King [[Jigme Singye Wangchuk]] of Bhutan during the 1990s.

The government provided financial assistance for the construction of Buddhist temples and shrines and state funding for monks and monasteries. NGOs alleged that the government rarely granted permission to build Hindu temples; the last report of such construction was in the early 1990s, when the government authorized the construction and renovation of Hindu temples and centers of Sanskrit and Hindu learning and provided state funds to help finance the projects. The government argued that it was a matter of supply and demand, with demand for Buddhist temples far exceeding that for Hindu temples. The Government stated that it supported numerous Hindu temples in the south, where most Hindus reside, and provided some scholarships for Hindus to study Sanskrit in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90227.htm |title=Bhutan: International Religious Freedom Report 2007 |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |year=2007 |accessdate=2010-01-28}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jane Barker''' (1652–1732) was a popular English fiction writer, poet, and a staunch Jacobite. She went into self-imposed exile when [[James II]] fled [[England]]  during the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, xxv&lt;/ref&gt; Her novels, ''The Amours of Bosvil and Galesia'', also published as ''Love Intrigues'' (1713), ''Exilius'' or ''The Banish'd Roman''  (1715), ''A Patchwork Screen for the Ladies'' (1723), and ''The Lining of the Patchwork Screen for the Ladies'' (1726) were written after she returned to London in 1704. Prior to and during her exile, she wrote a collection of poems justifying the value of feminine education and female single life, "Poetical Recreations" (1688),&lt;ref name="Mello, 2015"&gt;Mello, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and a group of political poems, "A Collection of Poems Referring to the Times" (1701), which conveyed her anxiety about the political future of England.&lt;ref name="Mello, 2015"/&gt;

Although not known for her letter writing, four extant letters are located in the [[British Library]] and within the Magdalen Manuscript at the Oxford Magdalen library, written between 1670-88.&lt;ref&gt;Pickard&lt;/ref&gt; Jane Barker was one of the first female authors to publish writings both in manuscript and print form, allowing modern scholars to study "the passage of Barker's poetry from coterie circles to larger, more impersonal communities of readers"&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; Never married, Jane Barker died quietly in 1732.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, xxxi&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Jane Barker was born in May 1652, in the village of [[Blatherwycke|Blatherwick]], [[Northamptonshire]] in England to Thomas Barker and Anne Connock.&lt;ref name="King, Kathryn R., 2004"&gt;King, Kathryn R., 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Connock seems to be descended from an unlanded and Roman Catholic branch of the Connock family, which might explain Jane's Papist affiliation.&lt;ref name="King, Kathryn R"&gt;King, Kathryn R.&lt;/ref&gt; A member of a royalist family, Jane Barker went into exile with James II once [[William III of England|William of Orange]] entered England, threatening an overthrow of the outwardly Catholic James II.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 11&lt;/ref&gt;  When Jane was 10 years old, Thomas Barker leased a property and manor in [[Wilsthorpe, Lincolnshire]]. This property was bequeathed to both Jane Barker and her mother upon her father's death in 1681&lt;ref name="King, Kathryn R., 2004"/&gt; and she relocated to the property upon returning from exile in 1704.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 13&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young woman, Jane Barker was taught [[Latin]], [[anatomy]], and herbal medicine by her brother, Edward, who matriculated at [[St. John's College, Oxford]] in 1668 and earned his M.A. from [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in 1674-5.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, xix&lt;/ref&gt; Proof of Jane Barker's knowledge of medicine can be seen in the advertisement for''Dr. Barker's Famous Gout Plaister,'' and in her poems about anatomy found in her "Poetical Recreations".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; Indebted to her brother for providing her with the basis of her education, Jane mourned his death in 1675, shortly after he finished his time at Oxford.&lt;ref name="Mello, 2015"/&gt;

==Political Affiliations and Exile==
Barker was baptized on 17 May 1652 according to the rites of the [[Church of England]]; however, she converted to [[Catholicism]] during reign of [[James II of England|James II]] (of England), between 1685 and 1688.&lt;ref name="King, Kathryn R"/&gt; After James' defeat by the [[Prince of Orange]] ([[William III of England|William III]]) in the [[Glorious Revolution]], London became a dangerous place for Catholics, prompting Barker to follow James II to exile in France.

Following an ideology of [[Jacobitism]], and a royalist, Jane Barker was one of the 40,000 people who followed James II in exile to France. She was one of the smaller number of individuals who maintained residence at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] in 1689.&lt;ref name="Jane Barker, Exile, 119"&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 119&lt;/ref&gt; James II maintained court in [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], a castle lent to the Stuarts by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] from 1689 to 1704.&lt;ref name="Jane Barker, Exile, 119"/&gt;

Barker's Jacobite involvement is further evidenced in her letter to [[James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde]], who began organizing a Jacobite invasion from France. Dated 19 March 1718, the letter implicitly informed Ormonde that his supporters in England awaited his invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, xxx&lt;/ref&gt; However, the letter was intercepted in that same year by the British Secrete Office, the anti-Jacobite intelligence organization. Since Barker's name and handwriting were unknown to the government authorities, it is suspected that she was used as a ghost-writer for the letter—a technique used to protect plotters whose identities and handwriting were already well known by authorities.

== Poetry ==

===''Poetical Recreations''===

Originally published in 1688, the first part of this two-part compilation comprises Barker's own poems addressed to her friends,&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 42&lt;/ref&gt; and the second part contains poems written by Barker's friends addressed to Barker herself. Described as written by "several Gentlemen of the Universities, and Others," the second part of ''Poetical Recreations'' was written by contributors from [[Cambridge]] or [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name="Jane Barker, Exile, 31"&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 31&lt;/ref&gt; Originally printed without the author's permission by Benjamin Crayle, the title page of ''Poetical Recreations'' boasted that poems within were "Occasionally written by Mrs. Jane Barker".&lt;ref name="Jane Barker, Exile, 31"/&gt; Benjamin Crayle also contributed twelve poems in Part Two and expressed his admiration for Barker's literary taste.  A note in what is now called the Magdalen Manuscript suggests that the publisher did not have Barker's permission to print the collection: it reads "now corrected by her own hand." The [[marginalia]] indicates that the initial collection was not yet meant for public consumption.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Kathryn King finds evidence through marginal notations in the Magdalen Manuscript that Barker's works are [[autobiographical]].&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Baker, Exile'', 33&lt;/ref&gt;

===''A Collection of Poems Referring to the Times''===
Written at the end of her time at Saint-Germaine-en-Laye, ''A Collection of Poems Referring to the Times'' is highly political and takes a pro-Stuart position.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 101&lt;/ref&gt; The speaker in the collection, Fidelia, is considered autobiographical. She is characterized as a Stuart [[loyalist]] and [[Catholic]] convert, depicting Barker's own political and religious affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 103&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to England, Jane Barker gifted a copy of her ''A Collection of Poems Referring to the Times'' to the son of James II for his birthday. The [[manuscript]] holding in the [[British Library]] is believed to contain a prototype copy of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exiles'', 122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prose==

===''Love Intrigues'' or ''The Amours of Bosvil and Galesia''===
[[File:The Entertaining Novels of Mrs. Jane Barker (title page).png|thumb|165px|''The Entertaining Novels of Mrs. Jane Barker'']]
Originally printed in 1713 and revised and reprinted in 1719, ''Love Intrigues'' was the first installment in what came to be known as the ''Galesia Trilogy''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, xxxvii&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that Bosvil's character was based heavily on a man whom Barker knew well.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, xxxviii&lt;/ref&gt; King suggests that the original edition of the novel in 1713 was not meant for publication because major revisions were made before it was reprinted, with a new title, in 1719.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 185&lt;/ref&gt; ''Love Intrigues'' was the first novel that Barker published, though probably without her permission, with [[Edmund Curll]].  Curll published some of her later works.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'' 187&lt;/ref&gt;  It was suspected that Curll probably added the term "Amours" to the title for better commercial appeal.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 186&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Exilius'' or ''The Banish'd Roman''===
[[File:Jane Barker's Exiles.jpg|thumb|Title Page from the 1715 edition of Jane Barker's ''Exiles''.]]
Published just after the death of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1714, ''Exilius'' can be read as a pro-Stuart response to the succession crisis that followed Anne's death.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 150&lt;/ref&gt; There is some suggestion that Curll sped up the release of the work so that he could capitalize on the market potential during the political upheaval.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 152&lt;/ref&gt; This novel is understood to be a projection of Jacobite feeling through themes including romance, love, and heroism.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 153&lt;/ref&gt; Written primarily for a female audience, the male characters within the fiction are stock representations while female characters are developed virtuously and follow strict moral tenets.&lt;ref&gt;Grieder, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Grieder states that formally the work is weak, but because it appeals to women during the early eighteenth century it can inform the reader about feminine interests during the time of its publication.&lt;ref&gt;Grieder, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Christian Pilgrimage'' ===
In 1718, Barker published her translation of a French Catholic devotional manual, ''The Christian Pilgrimage'', originally written by [[François Fénelon]], the [[archbishop]] of [[Cambrai]].&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 154&lt;/ref&gt; Translated as a response to the severe government reprisals on the Catholic community in England in early 1716, this devotional manual reframed a Protestants' understanding of Catholicism in order to discourage any further egregious actions against the Catholic community.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 155&lt;/ref&gt; Barker's translation of Fénelon's work offered a take on Catholicism that used the vocabulary of the Church of England; she removed extraneous Catholic representation from the original so as not to dissuade Protestant readership.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 157&lt;/ref&gt;

===''A Patch-Work Screen for the Ladies'' or, ''Love and Virtue'' and ''The Lining of the Patch Work Screen''===
Published in 1723, ''A Patch-Work Screen for the Ladies'' is based loosely on the ''Lettres Portugaises'', published in 1669. ''The Lining of the Patch-Work Screen'' was written in 1726. Often recognized to be a blending of genre conventions including romance, bourgeois fiction, poems, [[hymns]], odes, recipes, philosophical reflections, among others, the two works create a hybrid genre.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, xxxix&lt;/ref&gt; Barker uses the metaphor of the patch-work screen to raise questions about politics, sexual politics, economics, and finance in her society.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, xl&lt;/ref&gt; In ''A Patch-Work Screen for the Ladies'', Barker includes autobiographical information and also includes revised poems from ''Poetical Recreations''&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, xli&lt;/ref&gt; including "Anatomy," the poem which indicates Barker's proficiency in medicine.

== Gender issues ==

Capitalizing on the education she received from her brother, Barker established herself as an author within mostly male coteries during the second half of the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 48&lt;/ref&gt; Barker worked to alleviate the stigma of [[spinster]]hood and make it an acceptable alternative to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 63-4&lt;/ref&gt; A [[celibate]] woman, Barker belonged to the tradition of female martial valor and enjoyed her freedom from men in her own personal life.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 65&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that Barker used [[Katherine Philips]]' Orinda as a model for her own speaker, Fidelia,&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exiles'', 45&lt;/ref&gt; without including homosexual undertones that are present within Katherine Philips' writings.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 55&lt;/ref&gt; Barker established herself as a published female author whose print works were primarily for a female audience.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 137&lt;/ref&gt; Her dedications, "to the ladies," also suggest that she was writing for an elite female readership, although this dedication may have been included by Edmund Curll for marketing purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 199&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Jane Barker was the first woman to firmly position herself as an author working with both manuscript and print media.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, exile: A Literary Career, 1675-1725'', 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; Choosing to publish in both spheres gave both a mainstream readership as well as the more intimate coteries access to her work. Because of her interest in manuscript and print, Barker has one foot in the old world methods of circulating works and one in the modern market-place.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 207&lt;/ref&gt; Relying upon income from her later publications for money, Barker had more freedom and independence than other female authors of the early modern period.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Barker, Exile'', 213&lt;/ref&gt; Depicted as an autobiographical author by Kathryn R. King, Jane Barker's works display a strong feminist bent, offering her readership information regarding single womanhood, female education and politics.&lt;ref name="Mello, 2015"/&gt;

Jiriki and '''tariki''' (他力 meaning "other power", "outside help") are two terms in Japanese Buddhist schools that classify how one becomes spiritually enlightened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Tariki: Embracing Despair, Discovering Peace |last=Hiroyuki  |first= Itsuki|year=2001 |publisher= Kodansha |location= New York|isbn= 978-4062099813 |page=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jiriki is very much urged and practiced in [[Zen Buddhism]].  In [[Pure Land Buddhism]], tariki often refers to the power of [[Amitābha|Amitābha Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Alfred (1964). [https://web.archive.org/web/20121129070057/http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/3110 Shinran's Philosophy of Salvation By Absolute Other Power], Contemporary Religions in Japan 5 (2), 119-142&lt;/ref&gt;

These two terms describe the strands of practice that followers of every religion throughout the world develop. In most religions you can find popular expressions of faith which rely on the worship of external powers such as an idol of some kind that is expected to bestow favor after being given offerings of faith from a believer. Some believers of Pure Land Buddhism accept that through faith and reliance on Amitabha Buddha one will be led to enlightenment, as some Western Christians believe that asking Jesus to cleanse one's sins will lead to the attainment of such a desire. These are examples of tariki, reliance on a power outside of oneself for salvation.

Jiriki is experiencing truth for oneself and not merely accepting the testimony of another. An example of jiriki in Buddhism is the practice of meditation. In meditation, one observes the body (most often in the form of following the breath and mind to directly experience the principles of impermanence and dependent arising or "emptiness") of all phenomena. Such principles are formally discussed in the Buddhist scriptures, but jiriki implies experiencing them for oneself.

===International Festival===
Kearny High School is well-regarded for its International Festival. Each year in late May or June, the student body of Kearny High School has the opportunity to collectively display and celebrate its rich cultural diversity. On the day of the festival, students go down to the school's football field to visit the multiplicity of tents and tables that are set-up; with some selling food, desserts, and jewelry. Additionally, many students perform dances and play music native to their cultures for the entire student body to celebrate in. Kearny High School's student populated is largely represented by Irish-Americans, Peruvian-Americans, Portuguese-Americans, Brazilian-Americans, Puerto Rican-Americans, and Dominican-Americans, among many other groups. In 2010, the school celebrated its 13th Annual International Festival, of which featured over 85 different cultural tables.&lt;ref&gt;Duger, Rose.

==Legal cases and controversy==

===Religion in classroom controversy===
 &lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Matthew LaClair]] --&gt;
In the autumn of 2006, a controversy was generated by the discovery that David Paszkiewicz, a history teacher at Kearny High of 14 years, taught [[Christian]] doctrine to his students during an American history class. When confronted by Kearny High School junior Matthew LaClair in a meeting with Paszkiewicz and the administration, Paszkiewicz denied the charge. After this, LaClair produced recorded tapes in which Paszkiewicz was recorded saying that God "did everything in his power to make sure that you could go to heaven, so much so that he took your sins on his own body, suffered your pains for you, and he's saying, 'Please, accept me, believe.' If you reject that, you belong in hell."&lt;ref name=12.06NYTimes&gt;Kelley, Tina. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/18/nyregion/18kearny.html "Talk in Class Turns to God, Setting Off Public Debate on Rights"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. December 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The teacher is said to have also taught that there were [[Religious perspectives on dinosaurs|dinosaurs]] aboard [[Noah's Ark]] and that there is no scientific basis for [[evolution]] or the [[Big Bang]] theory of the origin of the universe.&lt;ref name=12.06NYTimes/&gt;

The controversy raised questions over the legal right of students to record what teachers tell them during class, with some advocating the practice to ensure teacher accountability, and others arguing that it infringes on the teacher's personal liberty.&lt;ref name=12.06NYTimes/&gt;

LaClair's supporters reported that "he has been the target of harassment and a death threat from fellow students and 'retaliation' by school officials who have treated him, not the teacher, as the problem. The retaliation, they say, includes the district's policy banning students from recording what is said in class without a teacher's permission and officials' refusal to punish students who have harassed Matthew."&lt;ref name=2.07NYTimes&gt;McGeehan, Patrick. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/20/nyregion/20teacher.html "Student, 16, Finds Allies in His Fight Over Religion"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 20, 2007. Accessed August 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deborah Jacobs, executive director of the [[American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey]] (ACLU-NJ) said Kearny High School had "violated the spirit and the letter of freedom of religion and the First Amendment", and that  the ACLU would support the LaClairs if they were to file suit. The [[People for the American Way Foundation]] expressed similar support.&lt;ref name=2.07NYTimes/&gt;

On November 16, 2006, ''[[The Jersey Journal]]'' reported that the School District had taken "corrective action" against Paszkiewicz, the precise nature of which was not specified. The administrators stated that further action might be warranted, based on Paszkiewicz's continuing conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Thorbourne, Ken (November 16, 2006). [http://www.jewsonfirst.org/06d/public124.html "Kearny school says action was taken against teacher who preached religion"]. Jews on First!&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Kibitsu-zukuri'''|吉備津造}}, {{nihongo|''kibi-zukuri''|吉備造}} or {{nihongo|''hiyoku irimoya-zukuri''||入母屋造|paired wing hip-and-gable roof style}} is a traditional Japanese [[Shinto architecture|Shinto architectural]] style characterized by four [[dormer]] [[gable]]s, two per lateral side, on the roof of a very large ''[[honden]]'' (sanctuary).&lt;ref name="jaanus"/&gt; The gables are set at a right angle to the main roof ridge, and the  ''honden''  is part of a single complex also including a ''[[haiden (Shinto)|haiden]]'' (worship hall).

==Structure==
[[File:Kibitsu Jinja honden haiden floorplan.svg|thumb|left|The shrine's floorplan]]
The T-shaped shrine is composed of two buildings: the ''haiden'' or prayer hall, in the front, and the ''[[honden]]'' or sanctuary, in the back, both under the same roof and joined by a short stairway (see floorplan). Both buildings show the clear influence of [[Japanese Buddhist architecture|Buddhist architecture]], as they include features of all major styles, that is [[Daibutsuyō]], [[Zenshūyō]] and [[Wayō]].&lt;ref name=jaanus/&gt;

===''Honden''===
The ''honden'', which shows strong ''[[daibutsuyō]]'' influences, is extremely large, measuring 14.64 x 17.99&amp;nbsp;m, or 5 (front) x 8 (depth) x 7 (rear) [[Ken (architecture)|bays]], with bays of a different length according to their position.&lt;ref name=jaanus/&gt;

The ''honden's'' interior has a complex structure, being divided in six separate sections joined by six different stairways (see flooplan). At the very center of the ''honden'' are two sanctuaries, the {{nihongo|''nai-naijin''|内内陣|inner inner shrine}} which measures 3 x 2 bays, and the {{nihongo|''naijin''|内陣|inner shrine}}, which measures 3 x 1 bays.&lt;ref name=jaanus/&gt; The two sanctuaries are surrounded on all sides by two corridors called the {{nihongo|''chūjin''|中陣|intermediate shrine}} and the {{nihongo|''gejin''|外陣|external shrine}}. Between the ''chūjin'' and the ''gejin'' lies a 5 x 1 bay space called {{nihongo|''kōhai-no-ma''|向拝間|lit. toward prayer space}},&lt;ref group=note&gt;A ''kōhai'' is a pent roof above the stairs of a shrine or temple&lt;/ref&gt; also called {{nihongo|''ake-no-dan''| 朱壇|crimson platform}}. The closer one gets to the center, the higher the floor and the ceiling.&lt;ref name=kj&gt;{{cite web|title=Honden |url=http://kibitujinja.com/honden.html |work=Kibitsu Jinja's Official Site |publisher=Kibitsu Jinja |accessdate=25 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823153128/http://kibitujinja.com/honden.html |archivedate=23 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ceiling's structure itself changes, as most of the ''chūjin'' and the entire ''gejin'' have no ceiling, and the roof is therefore exposed, whereas other sections have ceilings of different types. The ''nainaijin'' for example lies below the gables.&lt;ref name="kj"/&gt; The whole area is decorated with vermillion and black [[lacquer]].&lt;ref name=jaanus/&gt;

===''Haiden''===
[[File:Kibitsu Jinja 04.JPG|thumb|120 px|The ''haiden''. The main entrance is on the left.]]The  ''honden'' is connected in the front to the ''haiden'' by a 1 x 1 bay passage and a short stairway. The ''haiden's'' [[Moya (architecture)|core]] is just 3 x 1 bays, but it is surrounded on three sides by a 1-bay wide ''[[mokoshi]]'' (pent roof), bringing the building's external dimensions to 4 x 4 bays.&lt;ref name=jaanus/&gt; Both entrances to the ''haiden'' are on the gabled side (''[[tsumairi]]'' style).

===Roof===
Together with the outsize ''honden'', the most visible feature of the shrine are the twin gables on both sides of the roof. This style of roof, called ''hiyoku [[irimoya-zukuri]]'', or "paired wing, hip-and-gable roof style", consists of two ridges at a right angle to the main roof which end in two dormer gables.&lt;ref name=jaanus /&gt;

[[File:Holy relic sites map of Andhra Pradesh.jpg|thumb|250px|Dhanadibbalu is a Holy relic Buddhist site of Andhra Pradesh]]
'''Kotturu Dhanadibbalu''' &amp; '''Pandavula Guha''' is an ancient [[Buddhist]] site near Kotturu village of [[Rambilli]] mandal [[Visakhapatnam]] District of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. A post office is located at Kotturu Village with Pincode 531061&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090125081955/http://indiapost.gov.in/pin/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This is an ancient [[Buddhist]] remain site with a Maha Stupa and Remains of Vihara's along with a small portion of rock cut cave used by Buddhist [[monks]] during 1ST century BC to 2ND century AD on the hilly forest area. It lies along the banks of [[River Sarada]].

This place is locally known as "'''Dhanadibbalu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asihyd.ap.nic.in/vizag_monuments.html |title=Archeological Survey of India |publisher=Asihyd.ap.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''".Still excavations are to be done by the [[archaeology]] department at this site to excavate the viharas and minor edicts. Small rock [[cisterns]] are present very near to the Maha stupa, which is at the entrance of the hillock and at a further distance one can see the ruined mounds of Vihara with scattered bricks. From there we can reach the rock-cut [[caves]] with small (nearly 5) portions (locally known as pandavula guha, due to the resemblance with the number of accommodation in the cave).

Many [[bricks]] of the [[stupa]] and vihara are presently used by the locals (ignorant about the importance of this heritage site and lack of vigilance). There is a fencing around the remains site presently and a garden is being maintained by the archaeology department with a sign board.

==Geography==
Kotturu Dhanadibbalu is nearly 8&amp;nbsp;km from [[Yelamanchili]] town towards Atchutapuram.

'''Kshama''' ({{lang-sa|[[wikt:क्षमा|क्षमा]]}}, ''{{IAST|kṣamā}}'') is a [[Sanskrit]] word that relates to the acts of patience, releasing time and functioning in the now. [[A. A. Macdonnell|Macdonell]] defines it as: "patience, forbearance, indulgence (towards...)".&lt;ref&gt;See Macdonnell's [https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/new_chuck/macdonell_query.py?qs=%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B7%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE&amp;searchhws=yes dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; kshama word has a rich in meaning. It simply means forgiveness or forbearance. Kshama also indicates extreme patience and an more capacity to forget as also forgive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sssbpt.info/summershowers/ss2000/ss2000-12.pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Kshama forms one of the Ten Traditional [[Yamas]], or restraints, that are codified in numerous scriptures including the [[Shandilya Upanishad|Shandilya]] and [[Varaha Upanishad]]s and the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]] by [[Gorakshanath]]a.

It is sometimes used as a female given name.

According to legend, Kōga was the son of a local [[Jitō|landlord]] whose wife was kidnapped by ''[[tengu]]''. He journeyed to over sixty holy mountains trying to locate her, eventually finding a cave in [[Mount Tateshina]] which led to the underworld. On his re-emergence (via [[Mount Asama]]) he had become the snake deity [[Myōjin|Suwa-daimyōjin]] (more usually identified with the god [[Takeminakata]]).&lt;ref name="BreenTeeuwen2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Breen|author2=Mark Teeuwen|title=Shinto in History: Ways of the Kami|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MADlfH002mAC&amp;pg=PA35|date=January 2000|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2363-4|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of variants on the basic tale; some see Kōga reunited with his wife (and suggest that they had a son together in the underworld),&lt;ref name="Blacker2004"/&gt; some involve his two brothers joining him on the search,&lt;ref name="Dorson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard M.

'''Machig Labdrön''' ({{bo|t=མ་གཅིག་ལབ་སྒྲོན|w=ma gcig lab sgron}}, sometimes referred to as '''Adrön Chödron''', {{bo|w=A sgron Chos sgron}}),{{sfn|Stearns|2007|p=467, n. 17}} or Singular Mother Torch from [[Shannan, Tibet|Lab]]", 1055-1149){{sfn|Namkhai Norbu|1986}} was a renowned 11th-century [[Tibet]]an [[Tantra|tantric]] Buddhist practitioner, teacher and [[yogini]] who originated several Tibetan lineages of the [[Vajrayana]] practice of [[Chöd]] ({{bo|w=gcod}}).

Machig Labdrön may have come from a [[Bon|Bön]] family and, according to [[Namkhai Norbu]], developed Chöd by combining [[ethnic religion|native shamanism]] with the [[Dzogchen]] teachings. Other Buddhist teachers and scholars offer differing interpretations of the origins of Chöd, and not all of them agree that Chöd has Bön or [[shamanism|shamanistic]] roots.{{sfn|Edou|1996|p=6-8}}

==Iconography==
Iconographically, Machig Labdrön is often depicted with the attributes of a [[dakini]], a representation of enlightened female energy. She holds a drum (Skt. [[damaru]]) in her right hand and a bell (Skt. ''[[ghanta|ghaṇṭa]]'') ({{bo|t=དྲིལ་བུ་|w=drilbu}}) in her left. Her right leg is often lifted and the standing left leg is bent in motion. Machig is white in color with three eyes and wears the Six Bone Ornaments of the [[charnel ground]]s, which is traditional for a practicing [[yogini]]. Dakinis wear five bone ornaments; they are themselves the wisdom [[pāramitā]] attribute.

==Biography==

===Names===
Apart from the name ''Machig Labdrön'' used here, the following spellings and transliterations are also found, all referring  to the same woman:

*Machik Lapkyi Drönma ([[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]: ''ma gcig lab kyi sgron ma''), 
*Machig Lapdrönme (Wylie: ''ma gcig lab sgron ma''), 
*Machik Labdron (Wylie: ''ma gcig lab sgron''), 
*Maji Lab Dran (Wylie: ''ma gcig lab sgron''), and 
* Machig Laphyi (Wylie: ''ma-gcig la-phyi sgron-ma'') referring to her place of birth, La-phyi, in the region of [[Ü-Tsang]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yoniversum.nl/dakini/machiglab.html The Yoniverse]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Machig Labdrön's teachers, Sönam Lama, gave her the tantric name of ''Dorje Wangchuma'' ({{bo|w=rdo rje dbang phyug ma}}), which means "Diamond Independent Goddess."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120917214614/http://www.tibetinfor.com.cn/english/zt/TibetologyMagazine/..%5CTibetologyMagazine/200312005728151304.htm Nuns of the unique Joyul (gcod-yul)Sect of Tibetan Buddhism] see "2. Yogini Macik Labdron (ma-ciglab-sgron) and the Formation of Joyul Sect"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predictions of her birth===
In the ''Life of Yeshe Tsogyel'', [[Padmasambhava]] predicted that [[Yeshe Tsogyal]] would be reborn as Machig Labdrön, and her consort, [[Atsara Sale]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmafellowship.org/biographies/historicalsaints/princess-yeshe-tsogyal.htm some information on ''Atsara Sahle'' from Nepal] The Website of the Darma Fellowship of His Holiness the Gyalwa Karmapa&lt;/ref&gt; would become Topabhadra, Machig’s husband. Her assistant and Padmasambhava's secondary consort, Tashi Khyidren, would be reborn as Machig’s only daughter, and so on. All of the important figures in Tsogyel's life were to be reborn in the life of Machig Lapdron, including [[Padmasambhava]] himself, who would become Phadampa Sangye.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisdom-books.com/ProductExtract.asp?PID=8892 Women of Wisdom, Extract: MACHIG LAPDRON] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716120020/http://www.wisdom-books.com/ProductExtract.asp?PID=8892 |date=2011-07-16 }} by Tsültrim Allione&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetan Buddhists believe Machig was the [[Mind Stream]] emanation ([[tulku]]) of Yeshe Tsogyal, as well as "an emanation of the 'Great Mother of Wisdom,' ''Yum Chenmo,''([[prajnaparamita]]) and of ''[[Tara (Buddhism)|Arya Tara]]'', who transmitted to her teachings and initiations."{{sfn|Edou|1996|p=6}} Buddhists believe this pattern of reincarnations and emanations continued into the life just before her birth as Machig Labdrön an that in the lifetime before, she was the Indian yogi, Mönlam Drub. After his death, the body of the twenty-year-old Mönlam Drub is said to have remained "alive" in the cave of Potari in [[South India]]. According to tradition, it was Mönlam Drub's mindstream which entered the womb of ''Bum Cham'' "Great Noble Woman", who lived in the area of Labchi Eli Gangwar in Tibet, which caused the birth of Machig. According to one version of Machig Labdron's biography, Machig Labdron's mother experienced auspicious dreams of [[dakini]]s shortly after conception, dreams which contained the vase and the conch of the [[Ashtamangala]]:
{{quote|When consciousness entered the womb of the mother on the fifteenth day, she dreamt that four white ''dakinis'' carrying four white vases poured water on her head and afterwards she felt purified. Then ''seven'' dakinis, red, yellow, green, etc., were around her making offerings, saying “Honor the mother, stay well our mother to be.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
After that, a wrathful dark-blue ''dakini'' wearing bone ornaments and carrying a hooked knife and a retinue of four blue ''dakinis'' carrying hooked knives and skull cups, surrounded her, in front of her, behind her, and to the left and right. All five were in the sky in front of Bum Cham. The central ''dakini'' was a forearm’s length higher than the rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
She raised her hooked knife and said to the mother: “Now I will take out this ignorant heart.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
She took her knife and plunged it into the mother’s heart, took out the heart and put it in the skull cup of the dakini in front of her, and they all ate it. Then the central ''dakini'' took a conch which spiraled to the right and blew it. The sound resounded all over the world. In the middle of the conch was a luminous white “A”.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
She said” “Now I will replace your heart with this white conch shell”...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Even after she woke up, she felt great bliss.&lt;ref&gt;*Allione, Tsultrim. "The Biography of Machig Labdron (1055-1145)," in ''Women of Wisdom''. Snow Lion Publications. {{ISBN|1-55939-141-3}}, pp. 174-175&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Birth and early childhood===

===Childhood and young adulthood===
As a child and young woman, Machig made a living as a liturgy reader. She was fortunate to be literate and patrons would hire her to read the ''Prajnaparamita Sutra'' or 'The Perfection of Wisdom', a [[Mahayana sutras|Mahayana sutra]], in their homes as a form of blessing and to gain spiritual merit. Machig was known to be a very fast reader and so was in much demand as this meant that she could complete the entire text quickly and her patrons would have to pay for fewer meals for her while she read.

The [[namtar (biography)|namtar]] entitled ''Secret Biography of Machig Labdron''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simplybeing.co.uk/articles.php?p=The_Secret_Biography_of_Machig_Labdron,_1997 The Secret Biography of Machig Labdron]&lt;/ref&gt; relates the struggles that Machig Labdron underwent in order to avoid traditional marriage and eventually left home to practice Buddhism as her life's calling. After leaving the monastic order in Yuchong, she married Indian Pandita [[Topa Draya]] ({{bo|w=thod pa gra ya}}), also a Buddhist practitioner, who supported Machig in her practices. Together, they had two sons and one daughter (or three sons and two daughters by some accounts). Her second son, Tonyon Samdru (thod-smyon bsam-grub), became one of her main successors and a propagator of Machig Labdron's teachings. He became a monk at the age of 15 under the tutorship of [[Dampa Sangye]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.salzburg-online.at/buddhismus/RB/brpi/bio/machiglabdroen.htm] {{Link language|de}}&lt;!--German--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say that Machig received instructions from Dampa Sangye as her [[guru]] and the reincarnation of [[Padmasambhava]] which led to profound realizations. However, for several years Machig's main practice was one of tantric union with her spiritual consort and husband, [[Topabhadra]], an emanation of [[Gautama Buddha]], with whom she raised a family, living on the "red and white essence," according to a prediction given to Machig by [[Tara (Buddhism)|Arya Tara]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20081011172052/http://www.kalima.org/new-lineage/machig.htm Short Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mahasiddhas.org/courses-enlightenmentrelationship.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motherhood===
Even though Machig spent some time living with monastics, she was not a celibate nun; she partnered and had both daughters and sons who became lineage holders. One of her sons even started out as a thief. Machig was eventually able to bring him to the Dharma and became his teacher: "You may think that Gods are the one's who give you benefits, and Demons cause damage; but it may be the other way round. Those who cause pain teach you to be patient, and those who give you presents may keep you from practising the Dharma. So it depends on their effect on you if they are Gods or Demons," she said.

==Machig Labdrön's life as a spiritual teacher==
During Machig  Labdrön's lifetime, the Buddhist teachings that came from India were considered authentic and it was believed there were none that originated in Tibet. As one of Machig's biographies states:
{{quote|All the Dharmas originated in India&lt;br/&gt;
And later spread to Tibet&lt;br/&gt;
Only Machig's teaching, born in Tibet,&lt;br/&gt;
Was later introduced in India and practiced there.{{sfn|Edou|1996|p=1}}}}

As a result, there was so much controversy over Machig Labdrön's teachings that a delegation of Brahmins was sent from India to Tibet to assess Machig's qualifications and teachings. After her students gathered with her at Zangri Khangmar (Machig's home in Tibet from the age of 39 until her death at the age of 99),&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribes.tribe.net/chodtribe/photos/6c7b9ae5-979b-4983-b74e-c8b275fe5ec6 Zangri Kangmar: Machig's Main seat (photo)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118085328/http://tribes.tribe.net/chodtribe/photos/6c7b9ae5-979b-4983-b74e-c8b275fe5ec6 |date=2009-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Machig taught and debated with the pandits. In addition, a delegation was sent to [[South India]] to find the [[śarīra]] (relics) of Mönlam Drub as Machig instructed, thus adding further validity to her status as a teacher and lineage holder. As a result, of these and other events, it was determined that Machig's teachings were indeed authentic{{sfn|Harding|2013|p=93-98}} and established that the Chöd teachings were the first Buddhist teachings to emerge in Tibet.{{sfn|Edou|1996|p=3-6}} One source says, "Word of the widespread practice of Mahāmudra Chö in Tibet and Nepal was first viewed in India with great scepticism. A delegation of ācāryas was sent from Bodh Gayā to Tibet to test Machig Labrön and her teaching resulted in the acceptance of Mahāmudrā Chö as a valid and authentic Mahāyāna tradition. Thereafter its practice spread even to India."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lineages associated with Machig Labdron|url=http://vajrayana.triratna.info/Chod-tradition.html|website=vajrayana.triratna.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Students===
Along with her sons, prominent among Machig Labdron's disciples were four main women disciples who were called Machig Labdrön's ''Gyen'' "Ornaments". Many of Machig Labdrön's teachings were given in direct response to the questions of her students.{{sfn|Harding|2013|p=103-282}}

==Emanations==
Machig Labdrön has incarnated and emanated both in Tibet and in the West. In Tibet, it is said that Machig Labdrön took incarnation as Jomo Menmo (1248–1283).{{sfn|Dowman|1984|p=292}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jomo Menmo|url=http://treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Jomo-Menmo/8868|website=The Treasury of Lives|accessdate=6 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the information given by the website of [[Ogyen Trinley Dorje]], one of the two claimants to the seat of the [[Karmapa]], Jomo Menmo was born as a "karmic emanation" of Yeshe Tsogyal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dharma Fellowship: Library - Women Buddhas: A Short List of Female Saints, Teachers and Practitioners in Tibetan Buddhism|url=http://www.dharmafellowship.org/library/essays/women-buddhas.htm|website=www.dharmafellowship.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chokyi Dronma.jpg|thumb|Chökyi Drönma]]
The first [[Samding Dorje Phagmo]], Chökyi Drönma (1422–1455), a female [[tulku]] lineage of [[Vajravārāhī]], was understood to be an incarnation of Machig Labdrön.{{sfn|Stearns|2007|p=467, n. 17}}

In more recent history, in Tibet, the great [[yogini]] [[Shukseb Jetsun Choying Zangmo]] (1852–1953)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngakde.org/lochenbio.htm SHUKSEP LOCHEN CHÖNYI ZANGMO 1835-1953]&lt;/ref&gt;—also called Ani Lochen, Lochen Chönyi Zangmo, and Shukseb Jetsun Rinpoche&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shugsep Jetsun, the story of a Tibetan yogini|url=https://tnp.org/shugsep-jetsun-the-story-of-a-tibetan-yogini/|website=Tibetan Nuns Project|date=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;—was a recognized incarnation of Machig.{{sfn|Edou|1996|p=4}} Shuksheb Jetsun reinvigorated the Shuksep [[gompa]] ({{bo|w=shug gseb dgon}}) of the [[Kagyü]] thirty miles from Lhasa on the slopes of Mount Gangri Thökar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buddhist Digital Resource Center|url=https://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=G521|website=www.tbrc.org|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khandro Sonam Peldron of Bhutan (11 century)

Khandro Sonam Peldron of Wang Dharlung, Bhutan is said to be the main reincarnation of Machik Labdron.

Khandro Sonam is the wife of Phajo Drugom Zhipo of Tibet, who were crucial in the establishment of the [[Drukpa Lineage]] of Kagyü in [[Bhutan]]. Phajo Drugom Zhigpo was sent to Bhutan by Tsangpa Gyarey Yeshey Dorji of Druk Ralung, Tibet to establish the Drukpa Lineage in Bhutan. Phajo and Khandro  had four sons and a daughter together . The bridge where Phajo and Khandro met in Thimphu still exist today known as Lungtenzampa.  Khandro Sonam Peldron is known to have achieved the supreme enlightenment called Zha lue Phochen and is known to have flown to the heavenly Dali I abode from near Tango monastery in Thimphu.

Lama [[Tsultrim Allione]] (1947- ), an American Buddhist teacher, was recently recognized as an emanation of Machig Labdrön at Zangri Khangmar, Tibet, the place where Machig Labdrön lived from ages 37 to 99, and where she died. She was recognized by the resident Lama, Karma Nyitön Kunkhyab Chökyi Dorje. Lama Karma Nyitön Kunkhyab Chökyi Dorje offered Lama Tsultrim a self-arisen golden crystal [[kīla (Buddhism)|kīla]] or ceremonial dagger, the only remaining ''tsa tsa'' (icon) made from the ashes of Machig's body (a mixture of clay and ash imprinted with an image of Machig dancing), texts of Machig's teachings, a hat with symbolic meaning designed by Machig, and various other treasures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snowlionpub.com/pages/N80_9.html THE ''SNOW LION''  NEWSLETTER]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snowlionpub.com/pages/N80_9.php THE SNOW LION NEWSLETTER]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Machig Labdrön's Chöd==
Machig Labdrön's Chöd, also known as [[Mahamudra]] Chöd, has been widespread in Tibet since Machig's lifetime. It is also called "The Beggars' Offering" or "The Cutting-Off-Ritual." Chöd is a visionary Buddhist practice of cutting attachment to one’s corporeal form (in terms of the dualistic proclivity to relate to one's corporeal form as a reference-point that proves one's existence). This means that a practitioner offers the [[mandala]] of their own body in a [[ganachakra]] rite. The practitioner works entirely with their own mind, visualizing the offering, and—by practicing in lonely and dreaded places, like cemeteries—works to overcome all fear. This is also why Chöd was often used to overcome sickness in order to heal oneself and others. In some lineages of the Chöd practice, chodpas and chodmas (practitioners of Chöd) use a [[ghanta|ritual bell]], a specialized drum called a [[Damaru#Ch.C3.B6d damaru|Chöd damaru]], and a human [[Kangling|thigh-bone trumpet]]  (often obtained from the [[charnel]] ground of [[sky burial]]s).

==="Demons" in Machig Labdron's Chöd===
One of the distinct features of Machig Labdrön's Chöd is the focus on what are sometimes called either [[demon]]s ('dre) or ''devils'' (''bdud''). It is clear from Machig Labdrön's writings and teachings that the entities being dealt with in Chöd practices are formulations of the human mind, rather than [[supernatural]] beings. One of Machig Labdrön's unique contributions to Chöd is her understanding of demons.

As Machik Labdrön explained in answer to the questions of one of her students, Gangpa Muksang, {{quote|Son, listen. These are the characteristics of the devils (''bdud''). That which is called 'devil' is not some actual great big black thing that scares and petrifies whomever sees it. A devil is anything that obstructs the achievement of freedom. . . . Most of all, there is no greater devil than this fixation to a self. So until this ego-fixation is cut off, all the devils wait with open mouths. For that reason, you need to exert yourself at a skillful method to sever the devil of ego-fixation.{{sfn|Harding|2013|p=117}}}}

In another teaching, Machik Labdrön said:
{{quote|As long as there is an ego, there are demons.&lt;br/&gt;
When there is no more ego,&lt;br/&gt;
There are no more demons either! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Allione|first=Tsultrim|title=Feeding Your Demons: Ancient Wisdom for Resolving Inner Conflict|publisher=Little Brown and Company |year=2008|isbn=978-0-316-01313-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Anila Rinchen at Kagyu Ling in Burgundy, France, the Tibetan term for "demon" could be translated as "neurosis".

==Pilgrimage sites associated with Machig Labdron and Chöd==
There are many pilgrimage sites in Tibet associated with Machik Labdrön. Among these are the Tselha Namsum meditation caves near [[Gyamda]] in Tibet.

'''Mappila dialect''' (formerly '''Moplah Malayalam''') is a variety of [[Malayalam]], a language with a distinct modern diglossia, spoken predominantly by the [[Mappila|Muslim Mappila community]] of [[Kerala]], southern India. The Mappila form can be classified as a regional dialect in northern Kerala, or as a class or occupational dialect of the Mappila community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3581">'''Matthew 6:7''' is the seventh verse of the [[Matthew 6|sixth chapter]] of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[New Testament]] and is part of the [[Sermon on the Mount]]. This verse continues the discussion on the proper procedure for [[praying]].

In the [[King James Version]] of the [[Bible]] the text reads:
:But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, 
:as the heathen do: for they think that they 
:shall be heard for their much speaking.

The [[World English Bible]] translates the passage as:
:In praying, don’t use vain repetitions, as 
:the Gentiles do; for they think that they 
:will be heard for their much speaking.

For a collection of other versions see [http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Matthew%206:7 Bible Gateway Matthew 6:7] 

The term translated as "vain repetitions" is ''battalogein''. This word is unknown outside this verse appearing in none of the contemporary literature. It might be linked to the Greek term for babbling, or it might also be derived from the Hebrew ''batel'', [[Vanity|vain]]. It is often assumed to be a related to the word ''polugein'', and thus a reference to a large quantity of words.&lt;ref&gt;Luz, Ulrich. ''Matthew 1-7: A Commentary.'' trans. Wilhlem C. Linss. Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortess, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

This verse moves away from condemning the hypocrites to condemning the Gentiles. Matthew never makes clear who these Gentiles are, though pagan prayers to [[Baal]] and other gods are mentioned in the Old Testament. In Luke's version of this verse, found at [[Luke 11:2]], it is not the Gentiles who are condemned but "the rest of men."

France{{Who|date=July 2017}} notes that in this era Gentile prayer was portrayed as repeated incantations that had to be perfectly recited, but where the spirit and understanding of the prayer was secondary.&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. ''The Gospel According to Matthew: an Introduction and Commentary.'' Leicester: Inter-Varsity, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Fowler{{Who|date=July 2017}} states that the Jews believed the pagans needed to incessantly repeat their prayers, because their false gods would not answer them. The followers of the true God had no need to repeat their prayers as God would hear them the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Harold. ''The Gospel of Matthew: Volume One.'' Joplin: College Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; Schweizer{{Who|date=July 2017}} presents an alternate view. He does not feel ''battalogeo'' is a reference to repetition, but to nonsense. He argues that the Jews of that era felt that the pagans had forgotten the true name of God, and that their prayers were thus filled with long lists of meaningless words in an attempt to ensure the true name of God would at some point be mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eduard Schweizer|Schweizer, Eduard]]. ''The Good News According to Matthew.'' Atlanta: John Knox Press, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

This verse is not generally seen as a condemnation of repetitive prayer. Jesus himself repeats prayers, such as at [[Matthew 26:44]], and in two verses he gives a prayer to be repeated. Rather this verse is read as a condemnation of rote prayer without understanding of why one is praying. Protestants such as [[Martin Luther]] have used this verse to attack Catholic prayer practices such as the use of [[rosaries]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Hendriksen|Hendriksen, William]].

The '''[[beatification|Blessed]] Matthew Carrieri, [[Dominican Order|O.P.]]''', ({{lang-it|'''Matteo Carrieri'''}}; ca 1420 &amp;ndash; 5 October 1470) was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]] noted for the "austerity of his life."&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite web | title =The Friars Preachers: ''From the Origins to Savonarola'' | work =Dictionnaire de Spiritualité | publisher =Personal site of Benedict M. Ashley, O.P | url =http://op.org/domcentral/study/ashley/ds02ital1.htm | accessdate =2007-04-08 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20061222053750/http://www.op.org/domcentral/study/ashley/ds02ital1.htm | archivedate =2006-12-22 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the spiritual instructor of [[Stephana de Quinzanis]], and like her, an alleged [[stigmata|stigmatic]].

==Life==

He was born '''Giovanni Francesco Carrieri''' in the city of [[Mantua]] some time around 1420.&lt;ref&gt;The source for this name was in Spanish, and gave Matthew Carrieri's original name as ''Juan Francisco''. It may be reasonable to assume then, that, being Italian, his name would be ''Giovanni Francesco''.&lt;/ref&gt; He took the name '''Matthew''' when he entered the [[Dominican Order]]. His later success as a preacher was inarguable, attributable to the significant time he spent in spiritual exercises and meditation between preaching.&lt;ref name="santoral"&gt;[[Alban Butler|Butler's ''Lives of the Saints'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major events in Carrieri's life was his capture by a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[Privateer|corsair]], while on a voyage from [[Genoa]] to [[Pisa]].&lt;ref name="mores"&gt;For an account of this story in Carrieri's life, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=MeQQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA347&amp;lpg=RA2-PA347&amp;dq=%22matthew+carrieri%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QLXrtVLHxj&amp;sig=taZYeU0VyJfgxdBWojaHv98PjIk#PRA2-PA347,M1 Mores Catholici, Or, Ages of Faith] by [[Kenelm Henry Digby]] (pp. 347-348).&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to explain their purpose for being on board the ship, Carrieri spoke up so forcefully and convincingly, that the captain set him and the two friars accompanying him free. The friar then saw that the pirates were still keeping a woman and her daughter captive, planning to sell them into slavery in Algeria. He proposed to the captain that they keep him in their place. So shocked was the pirate captain by Carrieri's willingness to sacrifice himself, that he freed all five captives.&lt;ref name="santoral"/&gt;

Carrieri was a very close associate of a noted [[Third Order of St. Dominic|Dominican tertiary]], the Blessed [[Stephana de Quinzanis]], in her youth. He was responsible for her [[catechesis]], and predicted that she would be his "spiritual heiress." The meaning of this statement was illuminated when Stephana also began to experience pains similar to Carrieri's, which, according to those concerned, were the result of his devotion to the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]].&lt;ref name="santoral"/&gt;

Carrieri's [[hagiography]] states that on 5 October 1470 he asked his superior for permission to die, and upon receiving this, he died.&lt;ref name="santoral"/&gt;

==Veneration==

In 1482, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] authorized the solemn transfer of Matthew's [[relic]]s and allowed formal liturgical celebration of Blessed Matthew Carrieri's [[cult (religious practice)|''cultus'']].&lt;ref name="santoral"/&gt;

'''Maniach''' ([[Hebrew language|Heb.]] '''מניח''') lit. "one who places," pl. '''Manichim''' ([[Hebrew language|Heb.]] '''מניחים''') is a title that refers to a [[rabbi]] who transcribes the teachings of one of the [[Rebbe]]s of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] [[Hasidic]] movement. This term is unique to that movement.

==Explanation==
While the Chabad Rebbes would deliver their discourses, certain disciples with eidetic memory were appointed to memorise every word they heard. This is known as the role of the ''[[choizer]]''. After consultation with other ''choizrim'' (plural of ''choizer''), the ''choizer'' would typically then transcribe the words that he remembered, and this transcript, known as a ''hanocho'' (pl. ''hanochos''), was then released for public study. The ''hanochos'' of Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]]'s talks are available in the ''Sichos Kodesh'' and ''Hisvaduyos'' series. The former were produced by ''Vaad Hanachos Hatemimim'', and the latter by ''[http://lahak.org Vaad Hanachos Belahak]''.

The other type of ''hanochos'' were those made in preparing ''[[Likkutei Sichos]]'', Schneerson's largest and most monumental work. For this task, Schneerson's talks (by his own instruction) were not just recorded word for word, but rearranged and fleshed out according to the judgment of the ''meinichim''. Often several related talks from different years were merged. On many occasions Rabbi Schneerson was not satisfied with the text as submitted, and it had to be reworked several times. The same process was repeated for the Rebbe's smaller ''Maamorim Melukat'', a collection of Schneerson's Chassidic discourses. These often lengthy talks and discourses were always submitted to Rabbi Schneerson for a final editing, and then they released for public study.

Text previously attributed to a [[Council of Carthage (398)|fourth Council of Carthage in 398]], now identified as a collection called ''[[Statuta Ecclesiæ Antiqua]]'', prescribes in its seventh canon the rite of ordination of such an exorcist: the bishop is to give him the book containing the formulae of exorcism, saying, "Receive, and commit to memory, and possess the power of imposing hands on [[wiktionary:energumen|energumens]], whether baptized or catechumens"; and the same rite was still in use in the early 20th century, except that instead of the ancient Book of Exorcisms, the [[Roman Pontifical]], or [[Roman Missal]], was placed into the hands of the ordinand.&lt;ref name="CE-exorcist" /&gt; The same canons required that those preparing to be baptised (known as [[catechumens]]) were to undergo a daily imposition of hands by these exorcists.

The 4th century [[Mystagogical Catechesis]] of [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] gives a detailed description of baptismal exorcism, from which it appears that anointing with exorcised oil formed a part of this exorcism in the East.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril of Jerusalem. [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310120.htm Catechetical Lecture 20] (or ''On The Mysteries'', Lecture 2). Translated by [[Edwin Hamilton Gifford]].

Revised and edited for New Advent by Kevin Knight.&lt;/ref&gt; Anointing with oil as part of baptismal exorcism is also mentioned in the [[Apostolic Tradition]] and the Arabic [[Canons of Hippolytus]] – early 20th Century scholarship attributed both of these documents to [[Hippolytus of Rome]], but the origin of both sources is now disputed.

Authors such as [[Eusebius]] (3rd century) and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (4th century) provide further details of these minor exorcisms, prayers and ceremonies performed over adults preparing for baptism. Eusebius mentions the imposition of hands and prayer. Among the Latins, and especially at Rome, breathing accompanied with a form of exorcism and placing in the mouth a little exorcised salt, was employed in addition to the signing with the cross and the imposition of hands. Mostly those in the minor order of exorcist performed the ceremony of exorcism, then a priest signed the catechumens with the cross and laid hands upon them. The final ceremony took place on [[Holy Saturday]], when the priest himself performed the ceremony of exorcism.&lt;ref&gt;Scannell, T. (1908). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03430b.htm "Catechumen"] in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved May 21, 2014 from New Advent.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''exsufflatio'', or out-breathing of the demon by the candidate, which was sometimes part of the ceremony, symbolized the renunciation of the [[Devil]], while the ''insufflatio'', or in-breathing of the [[Holy Spirit]], by ministers and assistants, symbolised the infusion of sanctifying [[grace (Christianity)|grace]] by the [[sacrament]].&lt;ref name="CE-exorcism"&gt;Toner, Patrick.

Revised and edited for New Advent by Kevin Knight.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[English Reformation]], the [[Anglican]] baptismal rite in the 1549 ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', which was based on the [[Sarum Rite]], "took place at the church door and included singing with the cross on forehead and breast and an exorcism."&lt;ref name="Bradshaw2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradshaw|first=Paul F.|title=New SCM Dictionary of Liturgy and Worship|date=April 2013|publisher=Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd|isbn=9780334049326|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Lutheran Church]], in its 1526 ''Baptismal Booklet'' contained a minor exorcism before the [[sign of the cross]].&lt;ref name="Senn2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Senn|first=Frank C.|title=Introduction to Christian Liturgy|year=2012|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=9781451424331|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these ancient ceremonies were retained in the rites still practiced by the Catholic Church in the first half of the 20th century.

Today, in some provinces of the [[Anglican Communion]], the "Anglican liturgy does not involve an explicit exorcism or rejection of evil, but does including a signing with the cross and the wish that baptism delivers one from "the powers of darkness."&lt;ref name="Hansen2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=Regina|title=Roman Catholicism in Fantastic Film: Essays on Belief, Spectacle, Ritual and Imagery|date=27 May 2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786487240|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as the [[Anglican Church of Tanzania]], however, provide for anointing and consignation that accompanies "the exorcism that follows the examination of the candidates".&lt;ref name="ProfessorBooks2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hefling|first1=Charles |last2=Shattuck|first2=Cynthia |title=The Oxford Guide to The Book of Common Prayer|date=1 July 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199723898|page=493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholicism===
In 1972, the minor orders were reformed; men preparing to be ordained as [[Catholic priests]] or [[Deacon#Roman Catholicism|deacons]] would no longer receive the minor order of exorcist; the minor orders of [[lector#Ecclesiastical|lector]] and [[acolyte#Roman Catholicism|acolyte]] were retained, but redesignated as ''ministries''. It was left open to the Catholic bishops of individual countries to petition the Vatican to establish a ''ministry of exorcist'' if it seemed useful in that nation.&lt;ref&gt;Paul VI. [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19720815_ministeria-quaedam_lt.html ''Ministeria quaedam''], II: "The orders hitherto called minor are henceforth to be spoken of as 'ministries'."&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Pope Benedict XVI mandated that each diocese in the world should have at least one active exorcist, and encouraged training of priests by the [[International Association of Exorcists]] in Rome.

As part of the wider reforms of the [[Second Vatican Council]], all Catholic [[Liturgical books of the Roman Rite|liturgical books]] were updated, including the rites for the baptism of adults and of children. The revised rites retained prayers designated ''minor exorcisms'', for use during or before the ceremony of baptism itself. These would be performed as a routine part of the normal preparation for Christian baptism.

In 1969, an English translation was released of the Rite of Baptism for Children (later amended 1984).&lt;ref name="Conference2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales|title=Rite of Baptism for Children|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMT3ngEACAAJ|date=1 February 2004|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group, Limited|isbn=978-0-86012-355-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baptism could now be celebrated by a priest or deacon and included a formula of minor exorcism. This was located in the rite immediately following prayers for the child and a [[Litany of the Saints]], and was immediately followed by an anointing with the [[oil of catechumens]].

The Second Vatican Council also called &lt;ref&gt;Constitutions of the Second Vatican Council: [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html ''Sacrosanctam Concilium''] n. 64&lt;/ref&gt; for adults seeking baptism to be part of a formal process of preparation, or catechumenate, as was the case in the early church. A [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults]] was therefore prepared after the Council, and an interim English edition published in 1974. A revised and expanded version for the USA was published in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults: Approved for Use in the Dioceses of the United States of America by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and Confirmed by the Apostolic See|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGzJtpw2ho0C|year=1988|publisher=LiturgyTrainingPublications|isbn=978-0-930467-94-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rite includes a selection of eleven texts for minor exorcisms, which may be performed on one or more occasions during the months when a person enrolled as a catechumen is preparing for baptism.&lt;ref&gt;In the USA edition, at paragraphs 93A–93K, indicated as translations of 113-118 and 373.1-373.5 in the Latin original.&lt;/ref&gt; Anointing with the oil of catechumens may be repeated on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;USA edition, rubrics 98-101, translating Latin 103, 127-129, 212.&lt;/ref&gt; The notes also indicate that the minor exorcisms may be carried out by a lay [[catechist]] deputed for this purpose by the bishop, though the use of the oil of catechumens is reserved to deacons and priests.

In addition to these exorcisms, the Rite for Adults includes three ceremonies called [[Scrutiny|scrutinies]], to be celebrated as integral parts of the Sunday [[Eucharist]] on the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Sundays of [[Lent]]. Each scrutiny contain a prayer of exorcism reserved to the deacon or priest. There is also a simplified set of prayers provided for use with children mature enough to be personally catechised. The only minor exorcism  in the children's rite is part of a one-off scrutiny which is offered in two forms. Both texts use the image of entering the light of Christ, turning respectively from "darkness" and from "whatever could make them bad".&lt;ref&gt;USA rite, 300, translating Latin prayers 339 &amp; 392.&lt;/ref&gt;

The USA ritual book also contains additional prayers to be used with already-baptised Christians preparing to be received into full communion with the Catholic Church, including a one-off scrutiny which may be celebrated on the Second Sunday of Lent. Although it notes that a careful distinction must be made between the exorcisms of catechumens and this penitential rite for baptised adults, one possible prayer over the candidates prays that the candidates may "be freed of ... obstacles and falsehoods" while the other prays that they may "resist all that is deceitful and harmful" and that [[Jesus]] would "heal the wounds of their sins".&lt;ref&gt;USA rite, 463 &amp; 470, original material in English with no Latin antecedent.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lutheranism===
In the [[Lutheran Church]], through its Rite of Exorcism in the Baptismal Liturgy, "the Church has kept an opportunity to teach how serious this falleness' is, and can, through  bold proclamations against the devil, teach what a blessing and joy it is to receive the Holy Spirit with the Water and Word of Holy Baptism.  Rather than inviting the devil into one by ignoring his presence in all the unbaptized, the Church proclaims boldly his overthrow (James 4:7), and reminds herself, and all her members, who our enemies truly are: the devil, the world, and, yes, even our own sinful flesh.  And, the Good News that one dies with Christ, and rises to new life in Him with the Water and the Word, brings us comfort in our battles with our defeated enemies (Romans 6:4; 16:20)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exorcism|last=Morehouse|first=Michael|date=31 August 2011|publisher=Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodism===
The baptismal liturgy, used in the [[United Methodist Church]], contains a minor exorcism, when the candidate for baptism is asked to reject the 'spiritual forces of wickedness and evil powers of this world'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On Spiritual Deliverance (Exorcism)|last=Stepp|first=Todd|accessdate=20 June 2014|quote=Of course, the reality of "spiritual forces of wickedness" (to quote the United Methodist baptismal liturgy) is quite plain in the Bible, as the numerous accounts of exorcism do demonstrate. In the ancient Church, because Paul equates idol worship with "communion with demons" in 1 Cor. 10, an exorcism was performed on all converts as part of the baptismal ritual (since they were all converting from Paganism). This exorcism actually still exists in our own United Methodist baptismal liturgy, as I have already noted, when the candidate for baptism is asked to reject the "spiritual forces of wickedness and evil powers of this world".|publisher=Wesleyan-Anglican Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{slavery |expanded=Religion}}
The [[Latter Day Saint movement]] has had varying and conflicting teachings on [[slavery]]. Early converts were initially from the [[Northern United States]] and [[Abolitionism|opposed slavery]],&lt;ref name=CivilWarMissouri /&gt; believing they were supported by Mormon scripture.&lt;ref name=DC101&gt;D&amp;C {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 101|verse=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the church base moved to the [[Slave states and free states|slave state]] of [[Missouri]] and gained [[Southern United States|Southern]] converts, church leaders began justifying slavery.&lt;ref name=SmithHam /&gt; New scriptures were [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revealed]] teaching against interfering with the slaves of others.&lt;ref name=DC134&gt;D&amp;C {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 134|verse=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few slave owners joined the church, and took their slaves with them to [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], although [[Illinois]] was a [[Slave states and free states|free state]].&lt;ref name= "Life and Legacy"&gt;{{cite archive |first=Joel |last=Flake |item = Green Flake: His Life and Legacy |item-url =https://search.lib.byu.edu/byu/record/lee.3073452?holding=ad2wvimxwgpznx6l |type =Textual Record |item-id = |date = 1999|page=8 |pages= |fonds = |series = |file = |box= BX 8670.1 .F5992f 1999 |collection =Americana Collection |collection-url = |repository =L.

After Joseph Smith's death, the church split. The largest contingent followed [[Brigham Young]], who supported slavery but opposed abuse,&lt;ref name="Journal of Discourses 10" /&gt; and became [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). A smaller contingent followed [[Joseph Smith III]], who opposed slavery,&lt;ref name=launiusr /&gt; and became the [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (RLDS). Young led his followers to Utah, where he led the efforts to legalize [[History of slavery in Utah|slavery in the Utah Territory]].&lt;ref name="Young Jan 5" /&gt; Brigham Young taught that slavery was ordained of God and taught that the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party's]] efforts to abolish slavery went against the decrees of God and would eventually fail.&lt;ref name="Journal of Discourses 10c"&gt;{{Cite wikisource | title = Journal of Discourses/Volume 10/Necessity for Watchfulness, etc. | last  = Young | first = Brigham | year  = 1863 | pages = 248–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also encouraged members to participate in the Indian slave trade.&lt;ref name=Green /&gt;

==Teachings on slavery==
Mormon scripture simultaneously denounces both slavery and abolitionism in general, teaching that it was not right for men to be in bondage to each other,&lt;ref name=DC101 /&gt; but that one should not interfere with the slaves of others.&lt;ref name=DC134 /&gt; While in Missouri, Joseph Smith defended slavery, arguing that the Old Testament taught that blacks were cursed with servitude,&lt;ref name="Harris2015" /&gt;{{rp|22}} a belief that was common in America at the time.&lt;ref name=AmericanHam /&gt; While promoting the legality of slavery, the church consistently taught against the abuse of slaves and advocated for laws that provided protection.&lt;ref name="Journal of Discourses 10" /&gt; Critics said the church's definition of abuse of slaves was vague and difficult to enforce.&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt;

===Curse of Cain and Ham===
{{Further|Curse of Cain|Curse of Ham}}
[[Image:Ksenophontov noah.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Joseph Smith]] justified slavery using the [[Curse of Ham]].]]
Both Joseph Smith and Brigham Young referred to the [[Curse of Ham]] to justify slavery.&lt;ref name=SmithHam /&gt;&lt;ref name="Journal of Discourses 10c" /&gt; According to the [[Bible]], after [[Cain and Abel|Cain killed Abel]], God cursed him and put a mark on him,({{bibleref2|Genesis|4:8-15|KJV}}) although the Bible does not state the nature of the mark. In another biblical account, [[Ham]] discovered his father [[Noah]] drunk and naked in his tent. Because of this, Noah cursed Ham's son, [[Canaan]] to be "servants of servants".({{bibleref2|Genesis|9:20-27|KJV}}) While nothing explicitly supports enslaving black Africans, one interpretation that was popular in the United States during the Atlantic slave trade was that the mark of Cain was black skin, and it was passed on through Canaan's descendants, who they believed were black Africans. They argued that because Canaan was cursed to be servants of servants, then they were justified in enslaving Canaan's descendants. By the 1800s, this interpretation was widely accepted in America,&lt;ref name=AmericanHam&gt;Benjamin Braude, "The Sons of Noah and the Construction of Ethnic and Geographical Identities in the Medieval and Early Modern Periods," ''William and Mary Quarterly'' LIV (January 1997): 103–142. See also [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1853423 William McKee Evans], "From the Land of Canaan to the Land of Guinea: The Strange Odyssey of the Sons of Ham," ''American Historical Review'' 85 (February 1980): 15–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swift Superstition"&gt;John N. Swift and Gigen Mammoser, "'Out of the Realm of Superstition: Chesnutt's 'Dave's Neckliss' and the Curse of Ham'", ''American Literary Realism,'' vol. 42 no. 1, Fall 2009, 3&lt;/ref&gt; including among Mormons. An assistant president of the church, W. W. Phelps, wrote in a letter that Ham's wife was a descendant of Cain, and that the [[Canaanites]] were black Africans and covered by both curses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite wikisource | title = Latter Day Saints' Messenger and Advocate/Volume 1/Number 6/Letter to Oliver Cowdery from W.

In June 1830, [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible|Joseph Smith began translating the Bible]]. Parts of it were canonized as the [[Book of Moses]] and accepted as official LDS scripture in 1880. It states that "the seed of Cain were black" ({{lds|Moses|moses|7|22}}). This is the only place in LDS scripture that defines the mark of Cain as being black. The Book of Moses also discusses a group of people called the Canaanites, who were also black ({{lds|Moses|moses|7|8}}). These Canaanites lives before the flood, and hence before the Biblical Canaan. Later, in 1835, Smith produced a work called the [[Book of Abraham]]. It relates the story of Pharaoh, a descendant of Ham, who was also a Canaanite by birth. Pharaoh could not have the priesthood because he was "of that lineage by which he could not have the right of Priesthood,"({{lds|Abraham|abr|1|27}}) and that all Egyptians descended from him ({{lds|Abraham|abr|1|22}}). The Book of Abraham also says the curse came from Noah ({{lds|Abraham|abr|1|26}}). This book was also later canonized as Mormon scripture.

In 1836, Smith taught that the Curse of Ham came from God, and that it demanded the legalization of slavery. He warned those who tried to interfere with slavery that God could do his own work.&lt;ref name=SmithHam&gt;{{Cite wikisource | title = Latter Day Saints' Messenger and Advocate/Volume 2/Number 7/Letter to Oliver Cowdery from Joseph Smith, Jr. (Apr. 1836) | last  = Smith | first = Joseph | year  = 1836 | pages = 290 | quote = As the fact is uncontrovertable, that the first mention we have of slavery is found in the holy bible...

In 1844, Smith wrote his views as a candidate for president of the United States. The anti-slavery plank of his platform called for a gradual end to slavery by the year 1850. His plan called for the government to buy the freedom of slaves using money from the sale of public lands.&lt;ref name="Bush 1973"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V08N01_13.pdf |title=Mormonism's Negro Doctrine: An Historical Overview |journal=[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |date=Spring 1973 |last=Bush |first=Lester E., Jr. |pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}}

After the succession crisis, Brigham Young consistently argued slavery was a "divine institution," even after the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was issued during the Civil War by President Abraham Lincoln. In the year following the Emancipation Proclamation, Young gave several discourses on slavery and characterized himself as neither an abolitionist nor a pro-slavery man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Watt|first1=G.

Most modern scholars believe "Canaanites" to refer to people of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] origin, not black African. Most Christian, Jewish and Muslim religions also reject the teaching that Canaanites were black Africans.{{sfnm|Whitford|2009|1p=35|2a1=Ham|2a2=Sarfati|2a3=Wieland|2y=2001}}

=== Legality of slavery ===
[[Image:Emancipation_proclamation.jpg|thumb|Young taught the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] went against the decrees of God and predicted it would eventually fail]]
While Mormon scripture taught against slavery, it also taught the importance of upholding the law. Both Joseph Smith and Brigham Young stated that the Mormons were not abolitionists.&lt;ref name="Journal of Discourses 10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Are the Mormons abolitionists? No ... we do not believe in setting the Negroes free." (Smith 1977, p. 120)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Book of Mormon]], slavery was against the law.({{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|2|13}} &amp; {{lds|Alma|alma|27|9}}) The [[Doctrine and Covenants]] teaches that "it is not right that any man should be in bondage to another" (D&amp;C {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 101|verse=79}}), but it is unclear whether it applied to black servitude, since it was never used either for or against black slavery in early discourses on slavery.&lt;ref name=BushDialogue /&gt;{{rp|13}} The official position which was more often cited was the belief that one shouldn't interfere with slaves against the will of their masters, since it would cause unrest.(D&amp;C {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 134|verse=12}}) This explanation avoided taking a direct stance on slavery, and instead focused on following current laws.&lt;ref name=BushDialogue /&gt;{{rp|13}} In general, Mormon teachings encouraged obeying, honoring and sustaining the laws of the land.({{lds|Articles of Faith|a-of-f|1|12}})

In 1836, Smith wrote piece in the ''[[Messenger and Advocate]]'' which supported slavery&lt;ref name="Harris2015" /&gt;{{rp|18}} and affirmed that it was God's will.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;{{rp|15}} He said that the Northerners had no right to tell the Southerners whether they could have slaves. He said that if slavery were evil, southern "men of piety" would have objected. He expressed concern that freed slaves would overrun the United States and violate chastity and virtue. He pointed to biblical stories of slavery, arguing that the prophets who owned slaves were inspired of God, and knew more than abolitionists. He said that blacks were under the curse of Ham to be servants, and warned those who sought to free blacks were going against the dictates of God. [[Warren Parrish]] and [[Oliver Cowdery]] made similar arguments.&lt;ref name=BushDialogue /&gt;{{rp|14}} During this time the Mormons were based in the slave state of Missouri.

After the move to the free state of Illinois, Smith began expressing more abolitionist ideals. He argued that blacks should be given employment opportunities equal to whites.&lt;ref name=platform&gt;Joseph Smith [http://www.blacklds.org/mormon/platform.html Views of U.S. Government] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112030322/http://www.blacklds.org/mormon/platform.html |date=November 12, 2007 }} February 7, 1844&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that given equal chances as whites, blacks would become like whites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blacklds.org/mormon/quotes.html#smith43 ''History of the Church'', '''5''':217–218] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112000649/http://www.blacklds.org/mormon/quotes.html#smith43 |date=November 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his personal journal, he wrote that the slaves owned by [[Mormons]] should be brought "into a free country and set ... free— Educate them and give them equal rights."&lt;ref&gt;Compilation on the Negro in Mormonism, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; During Smith's 1844 campaign for president of the United States, he had advocated for the immediate abolition of slavery through compensation from money earned by the sale of public lands.&lt;ref name="Bush 1973"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold K.

Smith was killed in 1844, the year of his presidential bid, resulting in a schism among his followers. After the schism, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (later known as the [[Community of Christ]]), one of the resulting sects, embraced abolitionist ideals. Its leader following the schism, [[Joseph Smith III]], was friends with [[Abraham Lincoln]] and supported the Republican charge to end slavery.&lt;ref name=launiusr /&gt;

Under Brigham Young, the LDS Church continued to teach that slavery was ordained of God. After he helped [[History of slavery in Utah|institute slavery in the Utah Territory]], Young taught "inasmuch as we believe in the ordinances of God, in the Priesthood and order and decrees of God, we must believe in slavery".&lt;ref name="Young Collier" /&gt;{{rp|26}} He argued that blacks needed to serve masters because they were not capable of ruling themselves,&lt;ref name="Journal of Discourses 10b"&gt;{{Cite wikisource | title = Journal of Discourses/Volume 10/Knowledge, Correctly Applied, the True Source of Wealth and Power, etc. | last  = Young | first = Brigham | year  = 1863 | pages = 191 | quote = In the providences of God their ability is such that they cannot rise above the position of a servant.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When blacks were treated right, Young contended that they were much better off as slaves than if they were free.&lt;ref name="Young Collier"&gt;{{citation |title= The Teachings of President Brigham Young: Vol. 3 1852–1854 |editor-first= Fred C. |editor-last= Collier |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkRZGQ8oO8IC|year= 1987 |first= Brigham |last= Young |location= Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= Colliers Publishing Company |isbn= 0934964017 |oclc= 18192348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}} Because of these benefits, Young argued that slavery brought the "true liberty" which God had designed.&lt;ref name="Young Jan 5" /&gt;{{rp|110}} He taught that because slavery was decreed of God, man was not able to remove it.&lt;ref name="Young Collier"/&gt;{{rp|27}} He criticized the Northerners for their attempts to free the slaves contrary to the will of God and accused them of worshipping blacks. He opposed the [[American Civil War]], calling it useless and saying that the "for the cause of human improvement is not in the least advanced by the dreadful war which now convulses our unhappy country."&lt;ref name="Journal of Discourses 10c" /&gt; After President Lincoln signed the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], Young prophesied that the attempts to free the slave would eventually fail.&lt;ref&gt;Brigham Young said, "Will the present struggle free the slave? No... Can you destroy the decrees of the Almighty? You cannot. Yet our Christian brethren think that they are going to overthrow the sentence of the Almighty upon the seed of Ham. They cannot do that, though they may kill them by thousands and tens of thousands."{{Cite wikisource | title = Journal of Discourses/Volume 10/Necessity for Watchfulness, etc. | last  = Young | first = Brigham | year  = 1863 | pages = 248–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship between master and slave ===
[[File:Cicatrices de flagellation sur un esclave.jpg|thumb|150px|Church leaders taught against abuse and warned the white race would be cursed for their abuse of slaves.]]
Slave owners complained that the Mormons were interfering with slaves, but the LDS Church denied such claims.&lt;ref name=LatePersecutions&gt;{{cite book|title=Late persecution of the Church of Jesus Christ, of Latter Day Saints : ten thousand American citizens robbed, plundered, and banished; others imprisoned, and others martyred for their religion : with a sketch of their rise, progress and doctrine|url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/2825|year=1840}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}} In 1835, the Church issued an official statement that, because the [[United States]] government allowed slavery, the Church would not "interfere with bond-servants, neither preach the gospel to, nor baptize them contrary to the will and wish of their masters, nor meddle with or influence them in the least to cause them to be dissatisfied with their situations in this life, thereby jeopardizing the lives of men."&lt;ref name=BushDialogue&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V08N01_13.pdf|title=Mormonism's Negro Doctrine: An Historical Overview|author=Lester E.

Church leaders taught that slaves should not be mistreated. In March 1842, Smith began studying some abolitionist literature, and stated, "it makes my blood boil within me to reflect upon the injustice, cruelty, and oppression of the rulers of the people. When will these things cease to be, and the Constitution and the laws again bear rule?" &lt;ref&gt;''History of the Church,'' 4:544.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Brigham Young, the Church also opposed mistreatment of slaves. Young urged moderation, not to treat Africans as beasts of the field, nor to elevate them to equality with the whites, which was against God's will.&lt;ref name="Young Jan 5" /&gt;{{rp|109}} He criticized the Southerners for their abuse of slaves, and taught that mistreating slaves should be against the law: "If the Government of the United States, in Congress assembled, had the right to pass an anti-polygamy bill, they had also the right to pass a law that slaves should not be abused as they have been; they had also a right to make a law that negroes should be used like human beings, and not worse than dumb brutes. For their abuse of that race, the whites will be cursed, unless they repent."&lt;ref name="Journal of Discourses 10"&gt;{{Cite wikisource | title = Journal of Discourses/Volume 10/The Persecutions of the Saints, etc. | last  = Young | first = Brigham | year  = 1863 | pages = 104–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, as Utah sovereignty became a larger political issue, Young changed his stance on the role of the federal government in preventing abuse, arguing "if we treated our slaves in an oppressive manner, it is none of their business and they ought not to meddle with it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religion and Slavery|author=Paul Finkelman|year=1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eiMaAQAAIAAJ|page=397|quote=If Utah was admitted into the Union as a sovereign State, and we chose to introduce slavery here, it is not their business to meddle, with it; and even if we treated our slaves in an oppressive manner, it is still none of their business and they ought not to meddle with it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Black people and early Mormonism}}
Initially, Church leaders avoided the topic of slavery.&lt;ref name="Harris2015" /&gt;{{rp|18}} Most of the early converts of the church came from the northern United States and tended to be anti-slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/americanprophet/persecutions.html|title=American Prophet:The Church Early Persecutions|publisher=KPBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attitudes came into conflict with Southerners after they moved to Missouri.&lt;ref name=CivilWarMissouri&gt;{{cite book|title=The Civil War and the West: The Frontier Transformed: The Frontier Transformed|page=10|author=Carol L.

(July 1833), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Outrage followed Phelps' comments, and he was forced to reverse his position. He said he was "misunderstood" and that free blacks would not be admitted into the Church.&lt;ref name=BushDialogue&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V08N01_13.pdf|title=Mormonism's Negro Doctrine: An Historical Overview|author=Lester E.

The Church denied such claims and began to teach against interfering with slaves and more pro-slavery rhetoric. Some slaves owners joined the church during this period. However, this did not end the controversy, and the church was forcibly expelled from Missouri.

By 1836, the church already had some slave owners and slaves as members. The rules established by the church for governing assemblies in the Kirtland Temple included attendees who were "bond or free, black or white." &lt;ref&gt;''History of the Church,'' Vol. 2, Ch. 26, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; When abolitionists tried to solicit support from the Mormons, they had little success.&lt;ref name=Greeley&gt;{{cite book|title=An Overland Journey, from New York to San Francisco, in the Summer of 1859|author=[[Horace Greeley]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v3EFAAAAQAAJ|page=243|quote=I think I never heard, from the lips or journals of any of your people, one word in reprehension of that gigantic national crime and scandal, American Chattel slavery.

Nauvoo was reported to have 22 black members, including free and slave, between 1839–1843.&lt;ref&gt;''Late Persecution of the Church of Latter-day Saints,'' 1840&lt;/ref&gt; The state of Illinois did not pass laws to free existing slaves in the region for some time.

One slave-owning family in Nauvoo was the Flake family. They owned a slave named [[Green Flake]]. While building the [[Nauvoo Temple]], families were asked to donate one day in ten to work on the temple. The Flake family used Green's slave labor to fulfill their tithing requirement.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints==
{{See also|History of slavery in Utah}}
After Smith's death in 1844, the church went through a [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]], and split into multiple groups. The main body of the church, which would become the LDS Church, followed [[Brigham Young]] who was significantly more pro-slavery than Smith. Young led the Mormons to Utah and formed a theocratic government, under which slavery was legalized and the Indian slave trade was supported. Young promoted slavery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Genesis of a church's stand on race|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-genesis-of-a-churchs-stand-on-race/2012/02/22/gIQAQZXyfR_story.html|author=Jason Horowitz|date=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; teaching that blacks had been cursed to be "servants of servants" and that Indians needed slavery as part of a process of overcoming a curse placed on their [[Lamanite]] ancestors.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Slavery during westward migration===
When church leaders asked for men from the members of Mississippi to help with the westward emigration, they sent four slaves with [[John Brown (Mormon pioneer)|John Brown]] who was given the task to "take charge of them." Two of the slaves died, but Green Flake later joined the company, making it a total of three slaves arriving in Utah.&lt;ref name=new_wilderness /&gt; More slaves arrived as property of members in later companies.

===Ambiguous Period (1847–1852)===
Mormons arrived in Utah in the middle of the [[Mexican–American War]]; they ignored the Mexican ban on slavery. Instead, they recognized slavery as custom and consistent with the Mormon view on blacks.&lt;ref name=gunnison&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UIqAAAAYAAJ|title=The Mormons: Or, Latter-day Saints, in the Valley of the Great Salt Lake: a History of Their Rise and Progress, Peculiar Doctrines, Present Condition, and Prospects, Derived from Personal Observation, During a Residence Among Them|author=[[John Williams Gunnison]]|publisher=Lippincott, Grambo &amp; Company|year=1852|page=143|quote=Involuntary labor by negroes is recognized by custom; those holding slaves keep them as part of their family, as they would their wives, without any law on the subject.

After the [[Compromise of 1850]], Congress granted the Utah Territory the right to decide whether it would allow slavery based on [[popular sovereignty]].  Many prominent members of the church were slave owners, including [[Abraham O. Smoot]] and [[Charles C. Rich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/pioneers_and_cowboys/slaveryinutah.html Slavery in Utah]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Charles C. Rich 1875.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Apostle Charles C. Rich, a prominent Mormon slave owner]]
The territory did not pass any laws defining the legality of slavery, and the LDS Church tried to remain neutral. In 1851, apostle [[Orson Hyde]] said that because many church members were coming from the South with slaves, that the church's position on the matter needed to be defined. He went on to say that there was no law in Utah prohibiting or authorizing slavery and that the decisions on the topic were to remain between slaves and their masters. He also clarified that individuals' choices on the matter were not in any way a reflection of the church as a whole or its doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lythgoe |first=Dennis L. |url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/136fe4bc7890e0b3acc8c1d6ef7aaf89/ |title=Negro Slavery and Mormon Doctrine |journal=Western Humanities Review |via=ProQuest |volume=21 |issue=4 |date=Fall 1967 |page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Kate B.|title=The Story of the Negro Pioneer|date=1965|publisher=Daughters of Utah Pioneers|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|quote=We feel it to be our duty to define our position in relation to the subject of slavery.

But if the slave chooses to remain with his master, none are allowed to interfere between the master and the slave. All the slaves that are there appear to be perfectly contented and satisfied. When a man in the Southern states embraces our faith, the Church says to him, if your slaves wish to remain with you, and to go with you, put them not away; but if they choose to leave you, or are not satisfied to remain with you, it is for you to sell them, or let them go free, as your own conscience may direct you. The Church, on this point, assumes not the responsibility to direct. The laws of the land recognize slavery, we do not wish to oppose the laws of the country. If there is sin in selling a slave, let the individual who sells him bear that sin, and not the Church.''[[Millennial Star]]'', February 15, 1851.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

In 1851, a company of 437 Mormons under direction of [[Amasa M. Lyman]] and [[Charles C. Rich]] of the [[Quorum of the Twelve]] Apostles settled at what is now [[San Bernardino, California]].

====Indian slave trade====
{{See also|Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas}}
Mormons also were confronted in Utah with the practice of the Indian slave trade among regional tribes; it was very prevalent in the area. Tribes often took captives from enemies in raids or warfare, and used them as slaves or sold them. As the Mormons began expanding into Indian territory, they often had conflicts with the local residents. After expanding into [[Utah Valley]], Young issued the extermination order against the [[Timpanogos]], resulting in the [[Battle at Fort Utah]]. The Mormons took many Timpanogo women and children into slavery. Some were able to escape, but many died in slavery.&lt;ref name=Farmer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Jared|title=On Zion's Mount: Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape|date=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02767-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After expanding into Parowan, Mormons attacked a group of Indians, killing around 25 men and taking the women and children as slaves.&lt;ref name=uncovered_story /&gt;{{rp|274}}

[[File:Invitation to Sanpete by Jerry Anderson.jpg|thumb|left|A statue of Chief [[Walkara]], a Mormon slave trader.]]
At the encouragement of Mormon leaders, their pioneers started participating in the Indian slave trade.&lt;ref name="Congress" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beneath These Red Cliffs |author=Ronald L. Holt|publisher=USU Press|url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1048&amp;context=usupress_pubs|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite news |title=When Mormons Aspired to Be a 'White and Delightsome' People|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/mormons-race-max-perry-mueller/539994/|author=Emma Green |year=2017|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief [[Walkara]], one of the main slave traders in the region, was baptized in the church. In 1851, Apostle [[George A. Smith]] gave [[Chief Peteetneet]] and Walkara talking papers that certified "it is my desire that they should be treated as friends, and as they wish to Trade horses, Buckskins and Piede children, we hope them success and prosperity and good bargains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://signaturebookslibrary.org/david-whitmer/|title=A Book of Mormons|author=Richard S. Van Wagoner and Steven C. Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other regions in the Southwest, the Mormons justified enslaving Indians in order to teach them Christianity and achieve their salvation. Mormon theology teaches that Indians are descendants in part from the [[Lamanite]]s, an ancient group of people described in the Book of Mormon that had fallen into apostasy and had been cursed. When Young visited the members in Parowan, he encouraged them to "buy up the Lamanite children as fast as they could". He argued that by doing so, they could educate them and teach them the Gospel, and in a few generations the Lamanites would become "white and delightsome", as prophesied in Nephi.&lt;ref name=parowan&gt;{{cite book|title=Americana, Volume 8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rcxNAQAAMAAJ|publisher=National Americana Society|year=1913|author=American Historical Company, American Historical Society|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mormons strongly opposed the New Mexican slave trade.&lt;ref name=law1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/2521/United-States-V-Don-Pedro-Leon-Lujan-et-al-1851-52-Well-Established-Slave-Trade.html|title=United States V.

Don Pedro Leon Lujan et al.: 1851–52 – Lujan Ordered Not To Trade With Indians|publisher=JRank}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Walkara's band were upset by the interruption with the Mexican slave trade. In one graphic incident, Ute Indian Chief Arrapine, a brother of Walkara, insisted that because the Mormons had stopped the Mexicans from buying certain children, the Mormons were obligated to purchase them. In his book, ''[[Forty Years Among the Indians]]'', [[Daniel Webster Jones (Mormon)|Daniel Jones]] wrote, "[s]everal of us were present when he took one of these children by the heels and dashed its brains out on the hard ground, after which he threw the body towards us, telling us we had no hearts, or we would have bought it and saved its life."&lt;ref name=jones_autobiography&gt;{{citation |last=Jones |first=Daniel Webster |authorlink=Daniel Webster Jones (Mormon) |year=1890 |title=[[Forty Years Among the Indians]] |location=Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher=[[Juvenile Instructor]] Office |page=[https://archive.org/stream/fortyyearsamongi00joneiala#page/53/mode/1up 53] |oclc=3427232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal period (1852–1862)===
[[Image:Brigham_Young_by_Charles_William_Carter.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Brigham Young promoted slavery as a consequence of the [[Curse of Ham]].]]
One of the Mexican slave traders, Don Pedro Leon Lujan, was charged with trading with the Indians without a license, including Indian slaves. His property was seized and his slaves distributed to Mormon families in Manti. He sued the government, charging that he received unequal treatment because he wasn't Mormon. The courts sided against him, but noted that Indian slavery had never been officially legalized in Utah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/2522/United-States-V-Don-Pedro-Leon-Lujan-et-al-1851-52-Lujan-Ordered-Trade-with-Indians.html|title=United States V. Don Pedro Leon Lujan et al.: 1851–52 - Lujan Ordered Not To Trade With Indians|publisher=JRank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 5, 1852, Young, who was also [[List of Governors of Utah#Governors of the Territory of Utah|Territorial Governor of Utah]], addressed the joint session of the [[1st Utah Territorial Legislature|Utah Territorial Legislature]]. He discussed the ongoing trial of Don Pedro Leon Lujan and the importance of explicitly indicating the true policy for slavery in Utah. He explained that although he didn't think people should be treated as property, he felt because Indians were so low and degraded, that transferring them to "the more favored portions of the human race", would be a benefit and relief. He said this was superior to drudgery of Mexican slavery, because the Mexicans were "scarcely superior" to the Indians. He argued that it is proper for persons thus purchased to owe a debt to the man or woman who saved them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Captivity, Adoption, Marriage and Identity: Native American Children in Mormon Homes, 1847–1900|author=Michael Kay Bennion|url=http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2656&amp;context=thesesdissertations}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it was "necessary that some law should provide for the suitable regulations under which all such indebtedness should be defrayed". He argued that this type of service was necessary and honorable to improve the condition of Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journals of the Legislative Assembly of the Territory of Utah, of the ... Annual Session, for the Years ..., Volume 1|author=Utah. Legislative Assembly|year=1852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PH1DAQAAMAAJ|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also supported African slavery and said that "Inasmuch as we believe in the Bible, inasmuch as we believe in the ordinances of God, in the Priesthood and order and decrees of God, we must believe in slavery."&lt;ref name="servitude bill"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/CR100317B0001F0014 |title=Legislative council; views on servitude bill and African slavery |author=Brigham Young |work=Historian's Office Reports of speeches |date=January 23, 1852}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the blacks had the [[Curse of Ham]] placed on them which made them servants of servants and that he was not authorized to remove it. He also argued that blacks needed to serve masters because they are not capable of ruling themselves, and that when treated right, blacks were much better off as slaves than if they were free.&lt;ref name="servitude bill"/&gt; However, he urged moderation, not to treat Africans as beasts of the field, nor to elevate them to equality with the whites, which he believed was against the will of God.&lt;ref name="Young Jan 5" /&gt;{{rp|109}} He said that this was the principle of true liberty according to the designs of God.&lt;ref name="Young Jan 5"&gt;{{cite book|title=Journals of the Legislative Assembly of the Territory of Utah, of the ...

The acts had a few special provisions unique to slavery in Utah, reflecting Mormon beliefs. Masters were required by law to correct and punish their slaves, which particularly worried Republicans in Congress.&lt;ref name=Congress&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WmIUAAAAYAAJ|page=287|title=The Congressional Globe, Part 2|author=United States. Congress|publisher=Blair &amp; Rives|year=1857}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black slaves brought into the Territory had to come "of their own free will and choice"; and they could not be sold or taken from the Territory against their will. Indian slaves just had to be in possession of a white person, which Republicans in Congress complained was too broad.&lt;ref name=Congress /&gt; Indian slavery was limited to twenty years, while black slavery was limited to not be longer "than will satisfy the debt due his [master]." Several unique provisions were included which terminated the owner's contract in the event that the master neglected to feed, clothe, shelter, or otherwise abused the slave, or attempted to take them from the Territory against their will. Black slaves, but not Indian slaves, were freed if the master had sexual intercourse with them. Some schooling was also required for slaves, with blacks requiring less schooling than Indians. Despite the unique provisions in Utah, many black slaves received the same treatment as in the South. According to former slave Alexander Bankhead, the slaves were "far from being happy" and longed for their freedom.&lt;ref name=new_wilderness /&gt;&lt;ref name=redd /&gt;
[[Image:Justin_Smith_Morrill_-_Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Justin Smith Morrill]] attacked the Mormon belief in slavery]]

Mormons continued taking Indian children from their families long after the slave traders left and even began to actively solicit children from Paiute parents. They also began selling Indian slaves to each other.&lt;ref name=knack /&gt;{{rp|56}} By 1853, each of the hundred households in Parowan had one of more Paiute children.&lt;ref name=knack&gt;{{cite book|title=Boundaries Between: The Southern Paiutes, 1775–1995|author=Martha C.

Many of them tried to escape.&lt;ref name=uncovered_story&gt;{{cite book|title=The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America|author=Andrés Reséndez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brigham Young opposed slaves who wanted to escape their masters. This was enforced by Utah laws.&lt;ref&gt;Brigham Young told Greeley: "If slaves are brought here by those who owned them in the states, we do not favor their escape from the service of their owners." (see Greeley, ''Overland Journey'' 211–212) quoted in {{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Mormonism|author=Terry L. Givens, Philip L. Barlow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Es4fCgAAQBAJ|page=383}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Dan, a slave, tried to escape his master, William Camp, the courts upheld that Dan was Camp's property and could not escape. Dan was later sold to Thomas Williams for $800 and then to William Hooper.&lt;ref name=new_wilderness&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/news/ci_6783958|title=Utah settlers' black slaves caught in 'new wilderness'|author=Kristen Rogers-Iversen|publisher=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=September 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mormon position of slavery was often criticized and condemned by anti-slavery groups.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;{{rp|19}} In 1856, the key plank of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s [[Party platform|platform]] was "to prohibit in the territories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/gop/convention_1856.htm GOP Convention of 1856 in Philadelphia] from the Independence Hall Association website&lt;/ref&gt; While considering appropriations for Utah Territory, Representative [[Justin Smith Morrill]] criticized the LDS Church for its laws on slavery. He said that under the Mormon patriarchy, slavery took a new shape. He criticized the use of the term servants instead of slaves and the requirement for Mormon masters to "correct and punish" their "servants". He expressed concern that Mormons might be trying to increase the number of slaves in the state.&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt; [[Horace Greeley]] also criticized the Mormon position on slavery and general apathy towards the welfare of black people.&lt;ref name=Greeley /&gt;

===Emancipation (1862–present)===
When the [[American Civil War]] broke out, Utah sided with the North and many Mormon slave owners returned to Southern States because they were worried that they would lose their slaves.&lt;ref name=redd /&gt; On June 19, 1862 Congress prohibited slavery in all US territories, and on January 1, 1863, Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. The slaves of the Mormons were incredibly joyful when the news reached that they were free, and many left Utah for other states, particularly California.&lt;ref name=new_wilderness /&gt;&lt;ref name=redd /&gt;

After the slaves were freed, Young gave several discourses on slavery. He characterized himself as neither an abolitionist nor a pro-slavery man.&lt;ref name="Journal of Discourses 10" /&gt; He criticized both the South for their abuse of slaves and the North for worshiping of blacks. He opposed the [[American Civil War]], calling it useless and that the "cause of human improvement is not in the least advanced" by trying to free the slaves. He predicted the Emancipation Proclamation would fail. &lt;ref&gt; Millennial Star, No. 50, Vol. XXV, Saturday, December 12, 1863, page 787  https://books.google.com/books?id=f0hQAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA787&amp;lpg=PA787&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluations by historians===
Leaders of the church have had varying opinions on slavery, and many Mormon historians have discussed the issue.

Harris and Bringhurst noted that early Mormons wanted to stay neutral or aloof of slavery as a political issue, probably because of the strong Mormon presence in Missouri, which was then a slave state. In 1833, Joseph Smith stated that "it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another," but most historians agree that this statement referred to debt and other types of economic bondage. In 1835, Joseph Smith wrote that missionaries should not baptize slaves against the will of their masters. According to Harris and Bringhurst, Joseph Smith made these statements to distance the church from abolitionism, and not to align with pro-slavery positions, but it came across as supporting slavery. Church headquarters were in Ohio, where abolitionism and anti-abolitionism were polarized many citizens. After members of the church were expelled from Missouri to Illinois, Smith changed to an antislavery position, which he held until his death in 1844. More new converts were from free states and a handful of black people joined the church, which may have contributed to Smith's change in position.&lt;ref name="Harris2015" /&gt;{{rp|15–19}}

John G. Turner writes that Brigham Young's stance on slavery was contradictory. In 1851 he opposed abolitionism, seeing it as politically radical, yet he did not want to "lay a foundation" for slavery. In an 1852 speech, Young was against slavery, but also against equal rights for blacks. Two weeks after the speech, Young pushed to have slavery formally recognized in the Utah territory, stating that he was for slavery, and said that a belief in slavery naturally followed from believing in God's priesthood and decrees. Young mimicked proslavery apologetics when he argued that slaves were better off than European workers and that slavery was mutually beneficial to slave and master. Young feared that abolishing slavery would result in blacks ruling over whites. At the end of 1852, Young commented that he was glad the black population was small. Young was generous with the black servants and slaves in his life, but that did not change their lack of rights. According to Turner, Young's position on slavery is unsurprising given the racial context of the time, as discrimination was common in white American Protestant groups. Turner does note that Young's theological justification for racial discrimination set a discriminatory precedent that his successors believed they ought to perpetuate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=John G.|title=Brigham Young, pioneer prophet|date=2012|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780674067318|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGgSuTW-dgIC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=Brigham+Young+slavery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK8cGevuTWAhWLllQKHXmaCE8Q6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Brigham%20Young%20slavery&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|225–229}}

According to W. Paul Reeve, Brigham Young was the driving force behind the 1852 legislation to solidify slavery in the Utah territory, and that the common fear of "interracial mixing" motivated Young. Reeve also states that Mormons were surprised by the Native American slave trade from the Utes. The slave traders would insist that the Mormons buy slaves, sometimes killing a child to motivate their purchase. The 1852 law tried to change slavery into indentured servitude, requiring Mormons with Native American children to register them with their local judge and provide some education for them; the law did not work well in practice. Reeve explains that while Joseph Smith saw a potential for black equality, Young believed that blacks were inferior to whites by divine design.&lt;ref name=Reeve/&gt;{{rp|143–145}}

==In the Community of Christ==
[[Image:JosephSmith3.jpg|thumb|upright|Joseph Smith III opposed slavery.]]
[[Joseph Smith III]], son of Joseph Smith, founded the [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in 1860, now known as the [[Community of Christ]]. Smith was a vocal advocate of abolishing the slave trade, and followed [[Owen Lovejoy]], an anti-slavery congressman from Illinois, and [[Abraham Lincoln]]. He joined the Republican party and advocated for their antislavery politics. He rejected the fugitive slave law, and openly stated that he would assist slaves trying to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Joseph Smith III: Pragmatic Prophet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_xeJWwRouEC|author=Roger D. Launius}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was a strong opponent of slavery, he still viewed whites as superior to blacks, and held that they must not "sacrifice the dignity, honor and prestige that may be rightfully attached to the ruling races."&lt;ref name=launiusr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://launiusr.wordpress.com/2012/10/08/the-reorganized-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saintscommunity-of-christ-and-african-american-members/|title=The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: Community of Christ and African-American members}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints==
The [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] (FLDS Church) broke from the LDS Church in the early 20th century. Although it emerged well after slavery was made illegal in the United States, there have been several accusations of slavery. On April 20, 2015, the U.S. Department of Labor assessed fines totaling $1.96 million against a group of FLDS Church members, including Lyle Jeffs, a brother of the church's controversial leader, [[Warren Jeffs]], for alleged child slave labor violations during the church's 2012 pecan harvest at an orchard near Hurricane, Utah.&lt;ref name="ABC News 2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=FLDS Church Members Fined $2 Million for Alleged Child Labor Violations|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/flds-church-members-fined-million-alleged-child-labor/story?id=30916213|accessdate=8 May 2015|publisher=ABC News|date=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church has been suspected of trafficking underage women across state lines, as well as across the US–Canada&lt;ref name=ctv/&gt; and US–Mexico borders,&lt;ref&gt;Moore-Emmett, Andrea (27 July 2010).

[[File:Helvetlohja.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Medieval depiction of [[Hell]] personified as fearsome monster, based on Old Testament descriptions of Mot]]
{{Middle Eastern deities}}
'''Mot''' ({{lang-phn|𐤌𐤅𐤕}} ''mōwet'', {{lang-he-n|מות}} ''māweṯ'', {{lang-ar|موت}} ''mawt'') was the ancient Canaanite god of death and the Underworld. He was worshipped by the people of [[Ugarit]], by the Phoenicians, and also by the Hebrews of the Old Testament. The main source of information about his role in Canaanite mythology comes from the texts discovered at Ugarit, but he is also mentioned in the surviving fragments of [[Philo of Byblos]]'s Greek translation of the writings of the Phoenician [[Sanchuniathon]] and also in various books of the Old Testament.

==Forms of the name==
In [[Ugaritic]] myth, Mot (spelled ''mt'') is a [[personification of death]]. The word is cognate with forms meaning 'death' in other [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and [[Afro-Asiatic languages]]: with [[Arabic language|Arabic]] موت ''mawt''; with [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] מות (''mot'' or ''mavet''; ancient Hebrew ''muth'' or ''maveth''/''maweth''); with [[Maltese language|Maltese]] ''mewt''; with [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''mautā''; with [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] ''mot''; with [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Nabataeans|Nabataean]], and [[Palmyrene dialect|Palmyrene]] מות (''mwt''); with Jewish Aramaic, [[Christian]] [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] Aramaic, and [[Samaritan]] מותא (''mwt’''); with [[Mandaean]] ''muta''; with [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''mūtu''; with [[Hausa language|Hausa]] ''mutuwa''; and with [[Angas language|Angas]] ''mut''.

==Religion and mythology==
===Ugaritic texts===
The main source of the story of Mot 'Death' is [[Ugaritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ben Sasson|first1=Haim Hillel |title=A History of the Jewish People |date=1976 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MA |pages=11–12 |oclc=3103763}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cassuto|first1=U. |title=Baal and Mot in the Ugaritic Texts|journal=Israel Exploration Journal|date=1962|volume=12|issue=2|jstor=27924890}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a son of [[El (god)|'El]], and according to instructions given by the god [[Hadad]] ([[Baal|Ba'al]]) to his messengers, lives in a city named ''hmry'' ('Mirey'), a pit is his throne, and Filth is the land of her heritage. But Ba'al warns them:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;that you not come near to divine Death,
lest he made you like a lamb in his mouth,
(and) you both be carried away like a kid in the breach of his windpipe.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hadad seems to be urging that Mot come to his feast and submit himself to Hadad.

Death sends back a message that his appetite is that of lions in the wilderness, like the longing of dolphins in the sea and he threatens to devour Ba'al himself. In a subsequent passage Death seemingly makes good his threat, or at least is deceived into believing he has slain Ba'al. Numerous [[lacuna (MS)|gaps in the text]] make this portion of the tale obscure. The sun stops shining as its goddess [[Shapash]] joins Ba'al's sister [[Anat|'Anat]] in burying him. 'Anat then comes upon Mot, seizing him, splitting him with a blade, winnowing him in a sieve, burning him in a fire, grinding him under a millstone, and throwing what remains in the end over a field for birds to devour.

El, Baal's father, dreams that Baal is alive, and sends Shapash to bring him back to life because the land had become dry.

After seven years, Death returns, seeking vengeance and demanding one of Ba'al's brothers to feed upon. A gap in the text is followed by Mot complaining that Ba'al has given Mot his own brothers to eat, the sons of his mother to consume. A single combat between the two breaks out until the [[sun god]]dess [[Shapash]] upbraids Mot, informing him that his own father El will turn against him and overturn his throne if he continues. Mot concedes and the conflict ends.

====Influence on the Passover====
The Jewish tradition of [[Passover]] may have began as a ritual connected with the myth of Mot killing Baal.  Passover is held at the end of the rainy season, which could symbolize the death of Baal, as he was the god of rain.  In the myth, Mot eats Baal like a lamb.  During Passover, the priests eat lamb.  However, the bones of the lamb are not broken, possibly signifying that Baal will return in the fall.  During the festival, the priests prepare the body of the lamb in a similar fashion as Anat kills Mot.  The festival may have started with the belief that by participating in the death of Baal, they would insure that rains would not come during the spring, as rain in the spring could ruin the crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Development and Symbolism of Passover |author=Tamara Prosic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RrAyGmOHrpUC&amp;pg=PA117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Was Passover Originally an Ancient Canaanite Ritual to Stop the Rains?|author=Elon Gilad |url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-passover-canaanite-ritual-to-stop-rain-1.5345675 |date=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phoenician sources===
A Phoenician account survives in a paraphrase of the Greek author [[Philo of Byblos]] by [[Eusebius]],&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius of Caesarea, ''Praeparatio Evangelica'', Book 1, chap. 9–10, trans. E. H. Gifford (1903) http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_01_book1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; who writes of a Phoenician historian named [[Sanchuniathon]]. In this account Death is a son of 'El and counted as a god, as the text says in speaking of 'El/[[Cronus]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... and not long afterwards he consecrated after his death another of his sons, called Muth, whom he had by [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]; this (Muth) the Phoenicians esteem the same as [[Thanatos]] ['Death'] and [[Pluto (god)|Pluto]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But earlier in a philosophical creation myth Sanchuniathon has referred to great wind which merged with its parents and that connection was called [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] 'Desire':

&lt;blockquote&gt;From its connection Mot was produced, which some say is mud, and others a putrescence of watery compound; and out of this came every germ of creation, and the generation of the universe. So there were certain animals which had no sensation, and out of them grew intelligent animals, and were called "Zophasemin", that is "observers of heaven"; and they were formed like the shape of an egg. Also Mot burst forth into light, and sun, and moon, and stars, and the great constellations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The language here is confusing, a bad summary and possibly corrupt,{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} and the form ''Mot'' here is not the same as ''Muth'' which appears later. But it may be that the full and coherent account would have made clear that muddy and putrescent Death is the source of life.

===Hebrew scriptures===
In Hebrew scriptures, Death ("''Maweth''/''Mavet(h)''") is sometimes personified as a devil or angel of death (e.g., {{bibleverse||Habakkuk|2:5|NRSV}}; {{bibleverse||Job|18:13|NRSV}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cassuto|first1=U.|title=Baal and Mot in the Ugaritic Texts |journal=Israel Exploration Journal |date=1962 |volume=12|issue=2|pages=81–83 |jstor=27924890}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both the [[Book of Hosea]] and the [[Book of Jeremiah]], Maweth/Mot is mentioned as a deity to whom Yahweh can turn over Judah as punishment for worshiping other gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Appearance of the Pantheon in Judah in The Triumph of Elohim|last=Handy|first=Lowell|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1995|isbn=0-8028-4161-9 |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Bede Johnson''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} (born 2 November 1928) is an [[English people|English]] journalist, [[popular history|popular historian]], speechwriter, and author. While associated with the political left in his early career, he is now a conservative popular historian.

Johnson was educated at the [[Jesuit]] independent school [[Stonyhurst College]], and at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. He first came to prominence in the 1950s as a journalist writing for and later editing the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine. A prolific writer, Johnson has written over 40 books and contributed to numerous magazines and newspapers.  His sons include the journalist [[Daniel Johnson (journalist)|Daniel Johnson]], founder of ''[[Standpoint (magazine)|Standpoint]]'', and the businessman [[Luke Johnson (businessman)|Luke Johnson]], former chairman of [[Channel 4]].

== Early life and career ==
Johnson was born in [[Manchester]]. His father, William Aloysius Johnson, was an artist and Principal of the Art School in Burslem, [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[Staffordshire]]. At [[Stonyhurst College|Stonyhurst]], Johnson received an education grounded in the [[Jesuit]] method,&lt;ref&gt;As he saw it in his 1957 "Conviction" essay.&lt;/ref&gt; which he preferred over the more secularized curriculum of Oxford. Whilst at Oxford, Johnson was tutored by the historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]]&lt;ref name="bugles"&gt;{{Citation |first=Paul Bede |last=Johnson |title=Bugles softly blowing, national service was a time to treasure |journal=The Spectator |date=22 July 2000 |publisher=Find articles}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a member of the exclusive [[Stubbs Society]].

After graduating with a [[British undergraduate degree classification#Second-Class Honours|second-class honours]] degree, Johnson performed his [[national service]] in the Army, joining the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] and then the [[Royal Army Educational Corps]], where he was [[Officer (military)|commissioned]] as a [[Captain (land)#Military and Air Force|Captain]] (acting) based mainly in [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref name="bugles" /&gt; Here he saw the "grim misery and cruelty of the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] regime".&lt;ref&gt;''Conviction'', p 206&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's military record helped the Paris periodical ''Realités'' hire him,&lt;ref name="bugles" /&gt; where he was assistant editor from 1952 to 1955.

Johnson adopted a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] political outlook during this period as he witnessed, in May 1952, the police response to a riot in Paris, the "ferocity [of which] I would not have believed had I not seen it with my own eyes." (Communists were rioting over the visit of American general, [[Matthew Ridgeway]], who commanded the US Eighth Army during the [[Korean War]]; he had just been appointed Supreme Commander in Europe, and the Communists perceived him as anti-Communist.)[https://books.google.com/books?id=PUkgAGjIY0oC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=may+1952+paris+riot+ridgeway&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Mm10y0pYgj&amp;sig=o7yJUKjJ5djX5eH8CLU5sh3fAlI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic06ifh6LKAhVHRBQKHdC6CpUQ6AEIKDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=may%201952%20paris%20riot%20ridgeway&amp;f=false]. Then he served as the ''[[New Statesman]]''{{'}}s Paris correspondent. For a time, he was a convinced [[Bevanism|Bevanite]] and an associate of [[Aneurin Bevan]] himself. Moving back to London in 1955, Johnson joined the ''Statesman''{{'}}s staff.

Some of Johnson's writing already showed signs of iconoclasm. His first book, about the [[Suez War]], appeared in 1957. An anonymous commentator in ''[[The Spectator]]'' wrote that "one of his [Johnson's] remarks about [[Hugh Gaitskell|Mr Gaitskell]] is quite as damaging as anything he has to say about Sir [[Anthony Eden]]", but the Labour Party's opposition to the Suez intervention led Johnson to assert "the old militant spirit of the party was back".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/25th-january-1957/7/i-rave-been-reading-paul-johnsons-suez-war-macgibb "A Spectator' Notebook"], ''The Spectator'', 25 January 1957, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he attacked [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[James Bond]] novel ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr No]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Paul Bede |last=Johnson |title=Sex, Snobbery and Sadism |journal=New Statesman |date=5 April 1958}}, in {{Citation |editor-first=Stephen |editor-last=Howe |title=Lines of Dissent: Writings from the "New Statesman" |place=London |publisher=Verso |year=1988 |pages=151–54}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1964 he warned of "The Menace of Beatlism"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Menace of Beatlism|journal=New Statesman |date=28 February 1964 |pages=326–27}}, reprinted as [http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/08/archive-menace-beatlism "From the archive: The Menace of Beatlism"], ''New Statesman'', 28 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; in an article contemporarily described as being "rather exaggerated" by [[Henry Fairlie]] in ''The Spectator''.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Fairlie [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/6th-march-1964/4/beatles-and-babies "Beatles and Babies"], ''The Spectator'', 6 March 1964, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

He was successively lead writer, deputy editor and editor of the ''New Statesman'' magazine  from 1965 to 1970. He was found suspect for his attendances at the soirées of [[Antonia Fraser|Lady Antonia Fraser]], then married to a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP. There was some resistance to his appointment as ''New Statesman'' editor, not least from the writer [[Leonard Woolf]], who objected to a Catholic filling the position, and Johnson was placed on six months' probation.{{citation needed | date=May 2013}}

''Statesmen And Nations'' (1971), the anthology of his ''Statesman'' articles, contains numerous reviews of biographies of Conservative politicians and an openness to continental Europe; in one article Johnson took a positive view of events of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] in Paris, an article which at the time of first publication led Colin Welch in ''The Spectator'' to accuse Johnson of possessing "a taste for violence".&lt;ref&gt;Colin Welch [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/31st-may-1968/31/imbecile-power "AfterThought: Imbecile Power"], ''The Spectator'', 30 May 1968, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; According to this book, Johnson filed 54 overseas reports during his ''Statesman'' years.

== Shift rightward ==
In the 1970s, Johnson became increasingly [[Conservatism|conservative]] in his outlook and has largely remained so. In his ''Enemies of Society'' (1977), following a series of articles in the British press, he opposed the trade union movement, perceiving it as violent and intolerant, terming trade unionists "fascists". As Britain’s economy faltered, Johnson began to advocate the future British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]’s message of less government and less taxation. He was eventually won over to the Right and became one of Thatcher's closest advisers: "In the 1970s Britain was on its knees. The Left had no answers. I became disgusted by the over-powerful trade unions which were destroying Britain," he recalled in 2004.&lt;ref name="newsmax.com"&gt;Jeremy Bradshaw [https://archive.is/20130129185332/http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/6/29/165231.shtml "Paul Johnson: George Bush Is the Next Thatcher"], newsmax.com, 30 July 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

After Thatcher's victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|general election of 1979]] Johnson advised on changes to [[legislation]] concerning [[trade unions]] and was also one of Thatcher's speechwriters. Johnson was quoted in 2004:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I was instantly drawn to her," he recalls. "I'd known Margaret at Oxford. She was not a party person. She was an individual who made up her own mind. People would say that she was much influenced by [[Karl Popper]] or [[Frederick Hayek]]. The result was that Thatcher followed three guiding principles: truthfulness, honesty and never borrowing money."&lt;ref name="newsmax.com" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 1981 to 2009, Johnson wrote a column for ''[[The Spectator]]''; initially focusing on media developments, it subsequently acquired the title "And Another Thing". In his journalism, Johnson generally deals with issues and events which he sees as indicative of a general social decline, whether in art, education, religious observance or personal conduct. He has continued to contribute to the magazine, less frequently than before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spectator.co.uk/search/author/?searchString=Paul%20Johnson Contributor: Paul Johnson], spectator.co.uk website&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period he contributed a column to the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' until 2001. In a ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' interview in November 2003, he criticised the ''Mail'' for having a pernicious impact: "I came to the conclusion that that kind of journalism is bad for the country, bad for society, bad for the newspaper".&lt;ref&gt;Damian Thompson [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/11/03/ftjohn31.xml "'I'm very fond of that boy Tony'"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 3 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson is a regular contributor to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]],'' mainly as a book reviewer, and in the [[United States of America|United States]] to ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' and the ''[[National Review]]''. He also writes for ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.forbes.com/search/colArchiveSearch?aname=Paul+Johnson&amp;author=paul+and+johnson Contributor page: Paul Johnson], Forbes.com&lt;/ref&gt; For a time in the early 1980s he wrote for ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' after [[Rupert Murdoch]] urged him to "raise its tone a bit".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/29th-january-1994/21/and-another-thing "And Another Thing"], ''The Spectator'', 29 January 1994, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson is a critic of [[modernity]] because of what he sees as its [[moral relativism]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson [http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/all/3388016/and-another-thing.thtml "What the temptations on the high mountain mean today"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704133355/http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/all/3388016/and-another-thing.thtml |date=4 July 2010 }}, ''The Spectator'', 28 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and finds objectionable those who use [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] to justify their atheism or use it to promote biotechnological experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/17th-october-1998/26/and-another-thing "And Another Thing – Shaping up for a new moral catastrophe in the 21st century"], ''The Spectator'', 16 October 1998, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Steven Pinker]] have been a target of Johnson's criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson [http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/14089/the-ayatollah-of-atheism-and-darwins-altars/ "The ayatollah of atheism and Darwin’s altars"], ''The Spectator'', 27 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/31st-january-1998/22/and-another-thing "And Another Thing – An entertaining evening finding out how Professor Pinker's mind works"], ''The Spectator'', 31 January 1998, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; As a conservative Catholic, Johnson regards [[liberation theology]] as a [[heresy]] and defends [[clerical celibacy]], but departs from others in seeing many good reasons for ordination of women as priests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/1st-august-1998/12/my-faith-in-women Paul Johnson, "My Faith in Women"], ''[[The Tablet]]'', 1 August 1998, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Admired by conservatives in the [[United States of America|United States]] and elsewhere, he is strongly [[anticommunist]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson, ''[[Modern Times: A History of the World from the 1920s to the 1980s|Modern Times]]'', ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson has defended [[Richard Nixon]]&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson [http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/in-praise-of-richard-nixon/ "In Praise of Richard Nixon"], ''Commentary'', 86:4, October 1988, p.50-53&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Watergate]] scandal, finding his cover-up considerably less heinous than [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[perjury]] and [[Oliver North]]'s involvement in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]]. In his ''Spectator'' column, Johnson defended his friend [[Jonathan Aitken]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/28th-march-1998/19/and-another-thing "And Another Thing – The Aitken case: who is holding the scales of justice tilted?"], ''The Spectator'', 28 March 1998, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; has expressed admiration for General [[Augusto Pinochet]]&lt;ref name="Lourie"&gt;"Pinochet remains a hero to me because I know the facts" (from ''Heroes'', cited by Richard Lourie [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/30/AR2007113000075.html "Heroes Are People, Too"], ''The Washington Post'', 2 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and (qualified) admiration for [[General Franco]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/13th-november-1999/38/and-another-thing "And Another Thing – Here is my list of the century's greatest political figures"], ''The Spectator'', 13 November 1999, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was active in the campaign, led by [[Norman Lamont]], to prevent Pinochet's extradition to Spain after [[Augusto Pinochet's arrest and trial|Pinochet's arrest in London]]. "There have been countless attempts to link him to human rights atrocities, but nobody has provided a single scrap of evidence," Johnson was reported as saying in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Hopkins [https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/20/pinochet.chile "Rightwing fan club tinkers with Chile history"], ''The Guardian'', 20 January 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Heroes'' (2008),&lt;ref name="Lourie" /&gt; Johnson returned to his longstanding claim that criticism of Pinochet's regime on human rights grounds came from "the Soviet Union, whose propaganda machine successfully demonised [Pinochet] among the chattering classes all over the world. It was the last triumph of the KGB before it vanished into history's dustbin".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-512714/She-crucified-enemies-burnt-London-ground-Meet-Britains-feminist-Boadicea.html "She crucified her enemies and burnt London to the ground. Meet Britain's first feminist, Boadicea"], ''Daily Mail'', 6 February 2008 [extracts from ''Heroes'' (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has described [[France]] as "a republic run by bureaucratic and party elites, whose errors are dealt with by strikes, street riots and blockades" rather than a democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson [https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/0721/029.html "Anti-Americanism Is Racist Envy"], ''Forbes'', 21 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pseudo-Kufic''', or '''Kufesque''', also sometimes '''Pseudo-Arabic''', is a style of decoration used during the [[Middle Ages]] or the [[Renaissance]], consisting of imitations of the [[Arabic]] [[Kufic]] script, or sometimes Arabic cursive script, made in a non-Arabic context: "Imitations of Arabic in European art are often described as pseudo-Kufic, borrowing the term for an Arabic script that emphasizes straight and angular strokes, and is most commonly used in Islamic architectural decoration".&lt;ref name="Mack, p.51"&gt;Mack, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudo-Kufic appears especially often in [[Renaissance art]] in depictions of people from the [[Holy Land]], particularly the [[Virgin Mary]]. It is an example of [[Islamic influences on Western art]].

==Early examples==

[[British Museum]].]]
Some of the first imitations of the Kufic script go back to the 8th century when the English King [[Offa]] (r. 757–796) produced gold coins imitating Islamic [[dinars]]. These coins were copies of an [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] dinar struck in 774 by Caliph [[Al-Mansur]], with "Offa Rex" centred on the reverse. It is clear that the moneyer had no understanding of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as the Arabic text contains many errors. The coin may have been produced in order to trade with [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]]; or it may be part of the annual payment of 365 [[mancus]]es that Offa promised to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TGkz9NGFXIMC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;dq=manqush+coin#PPA330,M1 ''Medieval European Coinage'' by Philip Grierson p.330]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Medieval southern [[Italy]] (in merchant cities such as [[Amalfi]] and [[Salerno]]) from the mid-10th century, imitations of Arabic coins, called [[tarì]], were widespread but only used illegible pseudo-Kufic script.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pePPvGkGZDQC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=kharruba+coin&amp;lr= Cardini, p.26]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grierson, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CQfub3l_ejkC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=Tar%C3%AC+Arabic#PPA240,M1 Matthew, p.240]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples are known of the incorporation of Kufic script and Islamic-inspired colourful diamond-shaped designs such as a 13th French [[Limoges enamel]] [[Ciborium (container)|ciborium]] at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[[British Museum]] exhibit&lt;/ref&gt; The band in pseudo-Kufic script "was a recurrent ornamental feature in [[Limoges]] and had long been adopted in [[Aquitaine]]".&lt;ref name="Louvre"&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226036&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226036&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500778&amp;bmLocale=en Louvre museum notice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615183547/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226036&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226036&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500778&amp;bmLocale=en |date=2011-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous instances of pseudo-Kufic are known from European art from around the 10th to the 15th century. Pseudo-Kufic inscriptions were often used as decorative bands in the architecture of [[Byzantine]] [[Greece]] from the mid 11th century to mid-12th century, and in decorative bands around religious scenes in French and German wall paintings from the mid-12th to mid-13th century, as well as in contemporary manuscript illuminations.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudo-Kufic would also be used as writing or as decorative elements in textiles, religious [[halos]] or frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/spotlight/beautiful-gibberish-fake-arabic-in-medieval-and-renaissance-art|title=Beautiful Gibberish: Fake Arabic in Medieval and Renaissance Art|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are visible in the paintings of [[Giotto]] (c. 1267 – 1337).&lt;ref name="Mack, p.51"/&gt;

From 1300 to 1600, according to Rosamond Mack, the Italian imitations of Arabic script tend to rely on cursive Arabic rather than Kufic, and therefore should better be designated by the more generalist term of "Pseudo-Arabic".&lt;ref name="Mack, p.51"/&gt; The habit of representing gilt halos decorated with pseudo-Kufic script seems to have disappeared in 1350, but was revived around 1420 with the work of painters such as [[Gentile da Fabriano]], who was probably responding to artistic influence in [[Florence]], or [[Masaccio]], who was influenced by Gentile, although his own script was "jagged and clumsy", as well as [[Giovanni Francesco Toscani|Giovanni Toscani]] or [[Fra Angelico]], in a more [[Gothic art|Gothic]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.64-66&lt;/ref&gt;

From around 1450, northern Italian artists also started to incorporate pseudo-Islamic decorative devices in their paintings. [[Francesco Squarcione]] started the trend in 1455, and he was soon followed by his main pupil, [[Andrea Mantegna]]. In the 1456–1459 [[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno Altarpiece]], Mantegna combines pseudo-Islamic script in halos and garment hems ([[:File:Andrea Mantegna 025.jpg|see detail]]), to depiction of [[Mamluk]] book-bindings in the hand of San Zeno ([[:File:Andrea Mantegna 023.jpg|see detail]]), and even to a Turkish carpet at the feet of the Virgin Mary ([[:File:Andrea Mantegna 028.jpg|see detail]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact reason for the incorporation of pseudo-Kufic or pseudo-Arabic in Medieval or early Renaissance painting is unclear. It seems that Westerners mistakenly associated 13-14th century Middle-Eastern scripts as being identical with the scripts current during [[Jesus]]'s time, and thus found natural to represent early Christians in association with them:&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.52, p.69&lt;/ref&gt; "In Renaissance art, pseudo-Kufic script was used to decorate the costumes of [[Old Testament]] heroes like David".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tsiIvJ16AU0C&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Pseudo-Kufic&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=en Freider. p.84]&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason might be that artist wished to express a cultural universality for the Christian faith, by blending together various written languages, at a time when the church had strong international ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;"Perhaps they marked the imagery of a universal faith, an artistic intention consistent with the Church's contemporary international program." Mack, p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudo-Hebrew is also sometimes seen,&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; as in the [[mosaic]] at the back of the [[abse]] in [[Marco Marziale]]'s ''Circumcision'', which does not use actual Hebrew characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/largeImage?workNumber=NG803&amp;collectionPublisherSection=work National Gallery, image] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507202827/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/largeImage?workNumber=NG803&amp;collectionPublisherSection=work |date=2009-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was especially common in German works.

Finally pseudo-Arabic elements became rare after the second decade of the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.71"&gt;Mack, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rosamond Mack: "The Eastern scripts, garments, and halos disappeared when the Italians viewed the Early Christian era in an antique [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] context."&lt;ref name="Mack, p.71"/&gt;

'''Baithak''' or '''Bethak''', {{literally|seat}}, is a site considered sacred by the followers of the [[Pushtimarg]] tradition of [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] [[Hinduism]] in India for performing devotional rituals. These sites are associated with [[Vallabhacharya]] Mahaprabhu, the founder of Pushtimarg and his descendants. These sites are spread across India and are chiefly concentrated in [[Braj]] region in [[Uttar Pradesh]] and in western state of [[Gujarat]]. Total 142 Baithaks are considered sacred; 84 of Vallabhacharya, 28 of his son Viththalanath Gusainji and 30 of his seven grandsons.&lt;ref name="Richardson2014" /&gt;

==Baithaks==
[[Vallabhacharya]] Mahaprabhu was the founder of Pushtimarg who lived in 15th century. From the young age, he travelled and visited pilgrimage sites across India. He recited and gave discourses on sacred scriptures like [[Veda]]s, [[Ramayana]] and [[Bhagavata]] at these sites. The locations for recitation were usually banks of the rivers or lakes and quite groves in outskirt of towns. He recited original texts from scriptures as well as gave commentaries on them. Later these commentaries were compiled in ''Anubhashya'' and ''Subodhini''.&lt;ref name="pmn2"&gt;{{cite web | title=Baethakji | website=pushtimarg.net | url=http://www.pushti-marg.net/Baethak.html | access-date=20 August 2017 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20170820150625/http://www.pushti-marg.net/Baethak.html | archive-date=20 August 2017 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUEs-A4vazUC&amp;pg=PA167|title=Indian Philosophy|author=Swami Satyaprasad Dasji|publisher=Swaminarayan Temple Bhuj|isbn=978-81-909956-3-4|page=167|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824131727/https://books.google.com/books?id=EUEs-A4vazUC&amp;pg=PA167|archivedate=2017-08-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gokulanātha1985" /&gt;

These are 84 sites where Vallabhacharya gave discourses which are known as Baithaks. Later small shrines are built to commemorate the event at some sites. Some sites do not have shrines or temples to mark the place but they are known only through stories and texts.&lt;ref name="pmn2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richardson2014"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZoBABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|title=Seeing Krishna in America: The Hindu Bhakti Tradition of Vallabhacharya in India and Its Movement to the West|author=E.

At these shrines, the hand-written manuscripts and personal artifacts of Vallabhacharya are housed which are revered by the followers. They generally don't house images. Personal use products like clothes and ornaments are offered by the followers. Only water and sugar crystals are offered as Vallabhacharya used to fast during sacred recitals. They too follow seven [[Darśana|darshan]] schedule followed in Vaishnava Haveli temples.&lt;ref name="pmn2"/&gt;

His descendants also gave discourses at various places and established their Baithaks.&lt;ref name="pmn2"/&gt;

===Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya's 84 Baithaks===

[[File:Mahaprabhuji Bethak in Khambhaliya.jpg|thumb|Baithak in [[Jamkhambhaliya]], Gujarat|left]]
These 84 Baithaks are located from [[Rameshwaram]] at the southern tip of India to [[Badrinath]] in the north, and from [[Narayan Sarovar]] and [[Bet Dwarka]] in west to [[Puri]] in the east. Baithaks are also located at the places associated with his life such as at [[Tirumala]] [[Tirupati]], the family's tutelary deity; [[Champaran]], his birthplace; [[Varanasi]] where he spent significant part of his life. Baithaks are also located in the regions highly associated with [[Krishna]] such as in [[Braj]] region (now roughly corresponding to [[Mathura district]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]]) and in [[Dwarka]] in [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="pmn2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Richardson2014" /&gt;

RNA is funded by membership dues, donations, and Religion News Foundation support.

In 1999, former RNA executive director Debra Mason said in an interview that the topic of religion is very complex and requires extensive research, something which newspaper [[editing|editor]]s don't always appreciate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asne.org/reports/1999localnewshandbook/Ch9SPIRITUALITY.html The Local News Handbook] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528161411/http://www.asne.org/reports/1999localnewshandbook/Ch9SPIRITUALITY.html |date=2006-05-28 }} 1999, The [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Steve Buttry writing at [[The Poynter Institute for Media Studies|Poynter Online]] said, "The Religion Newswriters Association does a tremendous job helping reporters learn the beat."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=76751 Help Wanted on Religion Beat: Don't Limit the Talent Pool] Steve Buttry, Poynter Online, January 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; RNA was cited by Kenneth G. C. Newport and Crawford Gribben in their 2006 book ''Expecting the End: Millennialism in Social and Historical Context'' for helping reporters get in touch with credentialed scholars on religion, leading to better public understanding of religious issues.&lt;ref&gt;''Expecting the End: Millennialism in Social and Historical Context'', Kenneth G.

'''Saru Maru''' is the archaeological site of an ancient monastic complex and [[Buddhist]] caves. The site is located near the village of Pangoraria, [[Budhani Tehsil]], [[Sehore District]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]].&lt;ref name="Gupta"&gt;Gupta, The Origins of Indian Art, p.196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASI"&gt;[http://www.asibhopal.nic.in/monument/sehore_panguraria_sarcomprisedarea.html Archaeological Survey of India]&lt;/ref&gt; The site is about 120&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Sanchi]].

The site contains a number of stupas as well as natural caves for monks. In the caves many Buddhist graffiti have been found ([[swastika]], [[triratna]], [[kalasa]] ...). In the main cave were found two inscriptions of [[Ashoka]]: a version of the [[Minor Rock Edict]] n°1, one of the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], and another inscription mentioning the visit of Piyadasi (honorific name used by [[Ashoka]] in his inscriptions) as ''Maharahakumara'' (Prince).&lt;ref name="Gupta" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASI" /&gt;

{{Quote|[[File:Panguraria Ashoka Commemorative inscription.jpg|thumb|100px|The commemorative inscription]]

''The king, who (now after consecration) is called "Piyadasi", (once) came to this place for a pleasure tour while still a (ruling) prince, living together with his unwedded consort.''

According to the inscription, it would seem that [[Ashoka]] visited this Buddhist monastic complex while he was still a prince, and viceroy of the region of [[Madhya Pradesh]], while his residence was to be at [[Vidisha]] &lt;ref name="Gupta" /&gt;. In the Buddhist tradition, Ashoka's wife was called Vidishadevi, who was from [[Sanchi]], and whom he married in [[Vidisha]].

{{Politics of Bangladesh}}
'''Secularism''' ({{lang-bn|ধর্ম নিরপেক্ষতা}}) is one of the four fundamental principles according to the original 1972 [[Constitution of Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/sections_detail.php?id=367&amp;sections_id=24560|title=8.

The ethos of secularism in South Asia is in many ways different from that of Western versions that assert complete [[separation of church and state]]. Rather, it is the [[Freedom of religion in Bangladesh|freedom of individuals]] to practice the faith he or she desires without being subject to any form of state or communal discrimination.

==Secularism in the Constitution==
Secularism is one of the four fundamental principles that had been induced into the original [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] in 1972. The secularism principle was removed from the constitution in 1977 by the 5th amendment of the constitution by [[Ziaur Rahman]] and also declared [[Islam]] as the state religion in 1988 by [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad|Muhammad Ershad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/bangladesh-court-rejects-challenge-to-islam-as-state-religion-1459166329|title=Bangladesh Court Rejects Challenge to Islam as State Religion|last=Al-Mahmood|first=Syed Zain|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|issn=0099-9660|access-date=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[Bangladesh Supreme Court]] declared the 5th amendment illegal and restored secularism as one of the basic tenets of the Constitution&lt;ref name=Zeenews2010/&gt;

At present [[The Constitution of Bangladesh]] declares Secularism as one of the four fundamental principle of the state policy in Article-8 of Part-II&lt;ref&gt;Part II, Article: 8, ''The Constitution of Bangladesh''&lt;/ref&gt; and also declares Islam as the state religion in Article-2A of Part-I.&lt;ref&gt;Part II, Article: 2A, ''The Constitution of Bangladesh''&lt;/ref&gt; In Article 12 of Part -II of the constitution which was restored by the 15th amendment states –

''The principle of secularism shall be realised by the elimination of -''
# ''Communalism in all forms;''
# ''the granting by the state of political status in favour of any religion;''
# ''the abuse of religion for political purposes;''
# ''any discrimination against, or persecution of, persons practising a particular religion.''"&lt;ref&gt;Part II, Article: 12, ''The Constitution of Bangladesh''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of constitutional changes==
The removal of secularism from the constitution has been described by the country's largely secular establishment as a betrayal of [[Bengali nationalism]] and also opposed to mainstream Bengali culture and society, both of which are seen as remarkably [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] and [[progressivism|progressive]]. However, the [[Bangladesh Army]] with its close ideological association of centre-right and conservative political parties led by the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]], have stated that the term [[Bangladeshi nationalism]] refers to the country as an Islamic nation given that 89% of the population is Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bg.html#People |title=CIA – The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the newly elected [[Awami League]] government announced that it would re-introduce the original Four State Principles into the Preamble of the Constitution of Bangladesh. Although recognised by the United Nations as a "moderate Muslim democracy", Bangladesh's foreign minister [[Dipu Moni]] stated that the country is, in her words, "a secular, not moderate Muslim, country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.snnbd.com/newsdetails.php?cat_id=0.02&amp;id=12637#.UfvNSRbZHCE|title=Bangladesh is secular, not moderate Muslim country: FM|date=12 April 2009|publisher=SNN Media Limited|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Pohela boishakh 2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pohela Baishakh]], a secular festival being celebrated in Dhaka]]
Despite the country ceasing to be a secular state constitutionally once, secularism came back in 2010 and has been practised in the region of [[Bengal]] since ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = 12. Secularism and freedom of religion |url = http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/sections_detail.php?id=367&amp;sections_id=24560%257CSection |website = Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division |publisher = Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs |accessdate = 4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient and medieval rulers, especially the [[Pala Empire]] and [[Nawabs of Bengal]] practised secularism in making decisions of the court. [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]] would have prominent leaders from each community assisting the rulers. When the [[British East India Company]] came in the 18th century, it instituted separate laws for Hindus, Muslims and Christians. In doing so they laid the foundation for a civil code which remains largely unchanged to date.
[[Image:BD Dance.jpg|thumb|Bangladeshi artists performing a traditional dance. Bengali culture is seen as fiercely secular.]]
However, the British had perpetuated division amongst Bengali communities on the basis of [[divide and rule]]. Bengali Hindus were seen as affluent, educated and were accepted in civil services. On the other hand, [[Bengali Muslims]], especially those in [[East Bengal]] were highly discriminated. Most East Bengali Muslims were peasants and were persecuted by Hindu [[zamindars]] supported by the [[British Raj]]. This had led to several religious movements across East Bengal such as the [[Faraizi movement]] aimed at resisting the British and the Hindu zamindars class.
In 1905, [[Nawab Sir Khwaja Salimullah]], the Nawab of Dhaka, proposed the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partition of Bengal]] on communal lines to establish a separate province for the suppressed majority of the region who live in East Bengal and were mostly Muslim. The British accepted the partition and a new province by the name of [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] was created. However the partition was annulled in 1911 due to resistance from the [[Swadeshi]] movement in West Bengal that demanded the unification of Bengal.
In 1947, Bengal would again be partitioned on communal lines with East Bengal (present day Bangladesh) joining [[Pakistan]] and [[West Bengal]] being part of [[India]] though Hindu majority district of [[Khulna]] was awarded to Pakistan and Muslim majority districts of [[Malda district|Malda]] and [[Murshidabad]] were awarded to West Bengal. Ethnic cleansing of Hindus forced many Hindus to migrate to India notably on the backdrop of [[1950 East Pakistan riots]] and [[1964 East Pakistan riots]]. After the establishment of Pakistan, Bengalis faced immense discrimination and economic suffering. The [[Bengali nationalist]] movement quickly geared momentum with the increasing cultural and linguistic nationalism that were inherently secular. The [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] would see Bengalis, irrespective of religion join the fight for their freedom.

After achieving victory, Bangladesh's constitution, drafted in 1972, stated Four State Principles as the character of the new state. They would be Nationalism, Democracy, [[Secularism]] and Socialism. In 1975, [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], the country's founding father was assassinated by junior officers in the military and martial law was declared. Mostaq Ahmed would eventually be removed by counter coups in the volatile situation and army chief and liberation war hero Lt. Gen Ziaur Rahman (known as Zia) would take over as president.

After Zia assumed the presidency, he allied himself with his one-time enemies during the liberation war, including anti-liberation leaders such as [[Shah Azizur Rahman]], Sabur Khan and Kazi Abdul Kader. The decision to ally with anti-liberation leaders was seen as necessary political strategy to counter the Awami League of the assassinated Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Although Zia was popular for bringing stability after the volatility after 1975, he began using religion as a major factor in politics. He formed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party that professed the more Islamic "Bangladeshi nationalism" to replace the secular Bengali nationalism. The Bangladesh parliament in 1977 amended the constitution by changing the Four State Principles. The amendment caused the term "secularism" in the Permeable to be replaced with "Absolutue trust and faith in the Almighty Allah shall be the basis of all actions", and removed references to freedom of religion.
Finally in 1988, the country's second military ruler Hussain Muhammad Ershad declared Islam as the [[state religion]] in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1989 |editor1-last=Heitzman |editor1-first=James |editor2-last=Worden |editor2-first=Robert |chapter=More Opposition Pressure |chapter-url=http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/93.htm |title=Bangladesh: A Country Study |url=http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/ |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress |pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be the final blow to constitutional secularism in the country. Supporters of the BNP and the military would engage in various anti minority activities particularly against the Hindu and tribal communities of the country, most notably the anti-Hindu pogroms of 1988, [[1990 Bangladesh anti-Hindu violence|1990]], [[1992 Bangladesh violence|1992]] and [[2013 Bangladesh riots|2013]] which caused widespread damage and devastation across the country. 
However, after the return to democracy in 1991, there have been growing calls by the country's "pro liberation forces", the largely secular civil society and freedom fighters, as well as from the young generation to re introduce secularism back into the constitution. In 2009, the Awami League government announced that it would amend the constitution and reintroduce the original Four State Principles.

===Restoration by Supreme Court===
The Fifth Amendment of the constitution was declared illegal by the High Court of Bangladesh in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Special body sits today to review constitution |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=148536 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the government restored a constitution "in the spirit of the constitution of 1972"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Constitution to get back on '72 track|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=124640 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=2 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also included secularism as one of the state principles. Nevertheless, the opening words 'bismillah-ar-rahman-ar rahim' (In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful), that were added in 1997, remained in the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The secularity of Bangladesh Constitution after 15th Amendment |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/the-secularity-of-bangladesh-constitution-after-15th-amendment/ |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh upheld the 2005 High Court ruling that the Fifth Amendment to the constitution was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bangladesh is secular again: HC |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/bangladesh-is-secular-again-says-hc/20101005.htm |newspaper=Rediff.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Habib |first=Haroon |date=25 June 2011 |title=Bangladesh: restoring secular Constitution |url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/bangladesh-restoring-secular-constitution/article2132333.ece |newspaper=The Hindu |type=Opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A 'secular' Bangladesh: Country's top court lifts 4-year stay on order banning religion in politics |url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/a--secular--bangladesh-country-s-top-court-lifts-4year-stay-on-order-banning-religion-in-politics/564440/ |newspaper=Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prime minister Sheik Hasina stated that she favours allowing religion-based political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Bangladeshi-Premier-to-keep-Islam-as-state-religion-21781.html|title=BANGLADESH Bangladeshi Premier to keep Islam as state religion|first=|last=AsiaNews.it|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Petition in High court ===
After the Eighth Amendment of the constitution on 7 June 1988, 15 personalities had filed a public interest litigation challenging the provision of state religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bangladesh court rejects petition to scrap Islam as state religion |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/neighbours/280316/bangladesh-court-rejects-petition-to-scrap-islam-as-state-religion.html |newspaper=[[Deccan Chronicle]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=28 March 2016 |access-date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August 2015, a Supreme Court lawyer named Samendra Nath Goswami filed another petition with the High Court challenging the legality of the constitutional provision of Islam as the state religion despite revival of "secularism" as a fundamental state policy under a 2011 amendment to the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Islam to stay state religion |url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/99575/Islam-to-stay-state-religion-in-constitution |newspaper=[[Prothom Alo]] |date=28 March 2016 |access-date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 March 2016, the high court rejected the petition and retained Islam as the state religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bangladesh court rejects scrapping Islam as state faith |url=https://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/World/2016/Mar-28/344349-bangladesh-court-rejects-scrapping-islam-as-state-faith.ashx |website=The Daily Star Newspaper – Lebanon |access-date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Writ challenging Islam as state religion rejected |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/city/islam-retains-status-state-religion-1200808 |date=28 March 2016 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|''The Daily Star'']] |access-date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stupa''' ([[Sanskrit]]: "heap") is a [[mound]]-like or hemispherical structure containing relics (such as ''[[śarīra]]'' – typically the remains of [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] or [[bhikkhuni|nuns]]) that is used as a place of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O1-chedi.html Encyclopedia.com]. Credited to James Stevens Curl, ''A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture'', 2000, originally published by Oxford University Press 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A related architectural term is a [[chaitya]], which is a prayer hall or temple containing a stupa.

In Buddhism, circumambulation or ''[[pradakhshina]]'' has been an important ritual and devotional practice since the earliest times, and stupas always have a pradakhshina path around them.

Stupas may have originated as pre-Buddhist [[tumulus|tumuli]] in which [[śramaṇa]]s were buried in a seated position&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/stupa.htm |accessdate=2013-01-07|title=Buddhist Art and Architecture: Symbolism of the Stupa / Chorten|date=2006-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; called [[chaitya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.upenn.edu/coursepages/hist086/material/sanchi.htm|accessdate=2013-01-07|title=THE BUDDHIST STUPA: ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT|date=2005-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some authors have suggested that stupas were derived from a wider cultural tradition from the [[Mediterranean]] to the [[Indus valley]], and can be related to the conical mounds on circular bases from the 8th century BCE that can be found in [[Phrygia]] (tomb of [[Midas]], 8th c. BCE), [[Lydia]] (such as the tomb of [[Alyattes]], 6th c. BCE), or in [[Phoenicia]] (tombs of [[Amrit]], 5th c. BCE).&lt;ref&gt;"It is probably traceable to a common cultural inheritance, stretching from the Mediterranean to the Ganges valley, and manifested by the sepulchres, conical mounds of earth on a circular foundation, of about the eighth century B.C. found in [[Erythrae|Eritrea]] and [[Lydia]]." {{cite book |last1=Rao |first1=P.

===Mounds for the relics of the Buddha (5th century)===
[[File:Stupas-Original-00020.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Piprahwa]] stupa is one of the earliest surviving stupas.]] 
{{further information|Buddhist architecture}}
Religious buildings in the form of the Buddhist stupa, a dome shaped monument, started to be used in India as commemorative monuments associated with storing sacred relics of the Buddha.&lt;ref name=Ency&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica (2008), ''Pagoda''.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[parinirvana]] of the Buddha, his remains were cremated and the ashes divided and buried under eight mounds with two further mounds encasing the urn and the embers.&lt;ref name=Ency&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica (2008), ''Pagoda''.&lt;/ref&gt; The relics of the Buddha were spread between eight stupas, in [[Rajagriha]], [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]], [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]], [[Allakappa]], [[Ramagrama]], [[Pava]], [[Kushinagar]], and [[Vethapida]].&lt;ref name="BAStupa"/&gt; The [[Piprahwa]] stupa also seems to have been one of the first to be built.&lt;ref name="BAStupa"/&gt;

[[Guard rail]]s —consisting of posts, crossbars, and a coping— became a feature of safety surrounding a stupa.&lt;ref name=Chandra&gt;Chandra (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha had left instructions about how to pay hommage to the stupas: "And whoever lays wreaths or puts sweet perfumes and colours there with a devout heart, will reap benefits for a long time".&lt;ref name="BA143"&gt;Buddhist Architecture, Lee Huu Phuoc, Grafikol 2009, p.143&lt;/ref&gt; This practice would lead to the decoration of the stupas with stone sculptures of flower garlands in the Classical period.&lt;ref name="BA143"/&gt;

===Expansion under Ashoka (250 BCE)===
[[File:Early stupa 6 meters in diameter with fallen umbrella on side in Chakpat near Chakdara.jpg|thumb|An early stupa, 6 meters in diameter, with fallen umbrella on side. Chakpat, near [[Chakdara]]. Probably Maurya, 3rd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist architecture, p.173&lt;/ref&gt;]]
According to Buddhist tradition, Emperor [[Ashoka]] (rule: 273—232 BCE) recovered the relics of the Buddha from the earlier stupas (except from the [[Ramagrama stupa]]), and erected 84.000 stupas to distribute the relics across India. In effect, many stupas are thought to date originally from the time of Ashoka, such as [[Sanchi]] or [[Kesaria stupa|Kesariya]], where he also erected pillars with his inscriptions, and possibly [[Bharhut]], [[Amaravathi Mahachaitya|Amaravati]] or [[Dharmarajika Stupa|Dharmarajika]] in [[Gandhara]].&lt;ref name="BAStupa"&gt;Buddhist Architecture, Lee Huu Phuoc, Grafikol 2009, p.140-174&lt;/ref&gt; Ashoka also established the [[Pillars of Ashoka]] throughout his realm, generally next to Buddhist stupas.

The first known appearance of the word "Stupa" is from [[:File:Nigali Sagar word Stupa.jpg|an inscribed dedication]] by [[Ashoka]] on the [[Nigali Sagar]] pillar (spelled in [[Pali]] in the [[Brahmi script]] as 𑀣𑀼𑀩𑁂 ''"Thube"'' ).&lt;ref&gt;Amaravati: The Art of an early Buddhist Monument in context. [http://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/207_Amaravati.pdf p.23]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decorated stupas (125 BCE-)===
Stupas were soon to be richly decorated with sculptural reliefs, following the first attempts at [[Sanchi Stupa No.2]] (125 BCE). Full-fledged sculptural decorations and scenes of the life of the Buddha would soon follow at [[Bharhut]] (115 BCE), [[Bodh Gaya]] (60 BCE), [[Mathura]] (125-60 BCE), again at [[Sanchi]] for the elevation of the [[torana]]s (1st century BCE/CE) and then [[Amaravathi Mahachaitya|Amaravati]] (1st-2nd century CE).&lt;ref name="BA149"&gt;Buddhist Architecture, Lee Huu Phuoc, Grafikol 2009, p.149-150&lt;/ref&gt; The decorative embellishment of stupas also had a considerable development in the northwest in the area of [[Gandhara]], with decorated stupas such as the [[Butkara Stupa]] ("monumentalized" with [[Hellenistic]] decorative elements from the 2nd century BCE)&lt;ref&gt;"De l'Indus a l'Oxus: archaeologie de l'Asie Centrale", Pierfrancesco Callieri, p212: "The diffusion, from the second century BCE, of Hellenistic influences in the architecture of [[Swat District|Swat]] is also attested by the archaeological searches at the sanctuary of [[Butkara Stupa|Butkara I]], which saw its stupa "monumentalized" at that exact time by basal elements and decorative alcoves derived from [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic architecture]]".&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Loriyan Tangai|Loriyan Tangai stupas]] (2nd century CE).

===Development in Gandhara (3rd century BCE-5th century CE)===
[[File:Dharmarajika_stupa,Taxila.jpg|thumb|The [[Dharmarajika Stupa]], a semi-hemespherical, classic Indian-type Gandharan stupa, probably dated to the 3rd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist architecture, p.173&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The stupa underwent major evolutions in the area of [[Gandhara]]. Since Buddhism spread to [[Central Asia]], [[China]] and ultimately [[Korea]] and [[Japan]] through Gandhara, the stylistic evolution of the Gandharan stupa was very influential in the later development of the stupa (and related artistic or architectural forms) in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist architecture, p.181&lt;/ref&gt;  The Gandhara stupa followed several steps, generally moving towards more and more elevation and addition of decorative element, leading eventually to the development of the [[pagoda]] tower.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist architecture, p.182-183&lt;/ref&gt; The main stupa type are, in choronological order:

1) The [[Dharmarajika Stupa]] with a near-Indian design of a semi-hemispheric stupa almost directly on the ground surface, probably dated to the 3rd century BCE. Similar stupas are the [[Butkara stupa]], the [[Manikyala]] stupa or the Chakpat stupa.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist architecture, p.173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
2) The [[Saidu Sharif Stupa|Saidu Sharif]] Stupa, pillared and [[quincunxial]], with a flight of stairs to a dome elevated on a square platform. Many Gandhara minutiures represent this spectacular type (1st century CE).&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist architecture, p.174-176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3) The [[Loriyan Tangai]] Stupa, with a elongated shape and many narrative reliefs, in many way the Classical Gandharan stupa (2nd century CE).&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist architecture, p.176-177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
4) The near-pyramidal [[Jaulian]] stupa (2nd century CE).&lt;ref name=BA179/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
5) The [[cruciform]] type, as in the [[Bhamala Stupa]], with flights of stairs in the four cardinal directions (4th century CE).&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist architecture, p.178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
6) The towering design of the second [[Kanishka stupa]] (4-5th century CE).&lt;ref name=BA&gt;{{cite book |last1=Le |first1=Huu Phuoc |title=Buddhist Architecture |date=2010 |publisher=Grafikol |isbn=9780984404308 |pages=179-180 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA179 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Origin of the pyramidal temple====

| caption2 = &lt;center&gt;The [[Mahabodhi Temple]]: a stepped pyramid with round stupa on top.&lt;ref name=BA238/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}}
It is thought that the temple in the shape of a truncated pyramid may have derived from the design of the stepped stupas which developed in Gandhara. The [[Mahabodhi Temple]] in [[Bodh Gaya]] is one such example, formed of a succession of steps with niches containing Buddha images, alternating with Greco-Roman pillars.&lt;ref name=BA238&gt;Le Huu Phuoc, Buddhist Architecture, pp.238-248&lt;/ref&gt; The structure is crowned by the shape of an hemispherical stupa topped by [[finial]]s, forming a logical elongation of the stepped Gandharan stupas such as those seen in [[Jaulian]].&lt;ref name=BA238/&gt;

Although the current structure of the Mahabdhodi Temple dates to the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period (5th century CE), the "Plaque of Mahabhodi Temple", discovered in [[Kumrahar]] and dated to 150-200 CE based on its dated [[Kharoshthi]] inscriptions and combined finds of [[Huvishka]] coins, suggests that the pyramidal structure already existed in the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref name=BA238/&gt; This is confirmed by archaeological excavations in Bodh Gaya.&lt;ref name=BA238/&gt;

This truncated pyramid design also marked the evolution from the [[aniconic]] stupa dedicated to the cult of relics, to the [[iconic]] temple with multiple images of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas.&lt;ref name=BA238/&gt; This design was very influential in the development of later [[Hindu temple]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Le Huu Phuoc, Buddhist Architecture, p.234&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion in Asia===

}}
Stupa architecture was adopted in [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]] and [[East Asia]], where it became prominent as a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monument used for enshrining sacred relics.&lt;ref name=Ency/&gt; The Indian gateway arches, the ''[[torana]]'', reached East Asia with the spread of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica (2008), ''torii''&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars hold that ''[[torii]]'' derives from the torana gates at the Buddhist historic site of [[Sanchi]] (3rd century BCE – 11th century CE).&lt;ref name=Jaanus&gt;[http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/ Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System (2001), ''torii''.]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tibet]], the stupa became the chörten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanmajestictravel.com/buddhism/stupa|accessdate=2013-01-17|title=Stupa - Bhutanese, Nepalese, Tibetan Style Chortens or Stupa is the symbol of enlightened mind|publisher=Bhutan Majestic Travel|date=2013-01-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231185528/http://www.bhutanmajestictravel.com/buddhism/stupa|archivedate=2012-12-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[pagoda]] in [[East Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The pagoda has varied forms that also include bell-shaped and pyramidal styles. In the Western context, there is no clear distinction between a stupa and a pagoda. In general, however, "stupa" is the term used for a Buddhist structure in India or [[Southeast Asia]] while "pagoda" refers to a building in East Asia which can be entered and which may be secular in purpose.

Stupas were built in [[Sri Lanka]] soon after [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura]] converted to Buddhism. The first stupa to be built was the [[Thuparamaya]]. Later, many more were built over the years, some like the [[Jetavanaramaya]] in [[Anuradhapura]], being one of the tallest ancient structures in the world.

====Development of the Pagoda====
The Asian words for [[pagoda]] (''tā''in Chinese, ''t'ap'' in Korean, ''tháp'' in Vietnamese, ''tō'' in Japanese) are all thought to derive from the [[Pali]] word for stupa, '''''thupa''''', the [[Sanskrit]] pronunciation being ''stupa''. &lt;ref&gt;Buddhist architecture, p.183&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the type of the tower-like stupa, the last stage of Gandharan stupa development, visible in the second [[Kanishka stupa]] (4th century), is thought to be the precussor of the tower stupas in [[Turkestan]] and the Chinese pagodas such as [[Songyue Pagoda]] (523 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist architecture, p.180&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable stupas==
[[File:Borobudur temple panorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Borobudur]] bell-shaped stupas.]]
The earliest archaeological evidence for the presence of Buddhist stupas dates to the late 4th century BCE. In India, [[Sanchi]], [[Sarnath]], [[Amaravathi Mahachaitya|Amaravati]] and [[Bharhut]] are among the oldest known stupas. The tallest is the [[Jetavanaramaya]] Stupa located in the ancient city of [[Anuradhapura]], [[Sri Lanka]] with a height of 400&amp;nbsp;ft &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/tallest-stupa|title=Tallest stupa|work=Guinness World Records|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swat River|Swat Valley]] hosts a well-preserved stupa at Shingardar near [[Ghalegay]]; another stupa is located near [[Barikot]] and Dharmarajika-Taxila in [[Pakistan]]. In [[Sri Lanka]], the ancient city of [[Anuradhapura]] includes some of the tallest, most ancient and best preserved stupas in the world, such as [[Ruwanwelisaya]].

The most elaborate stupa is the 8th century [[Borobudur]] monument in [[Java]], [[Indonesia]]. The upper rounded terrace with rows of bell-shaped stupas contained Buddha images symbolizing [[Arūpajhāna]], the sphere of formlessness. The main stupa itself is empty, symbolizing complete perfection of enlightenment. The main stupa is the crown part of the monument, while the base is a pyramidal structure elaborated with galleries adorned with bas relief scenes derived from Buddhist texts and depicting the life of [[Gautama Buddha]]. Borobudur's unique and significant architecture has been acknowledged by UNESCO as the largest Buddhist monument in the world. It is also the world’s largest Buddhist temple.&lt;ref name="Guiness"&gt;

The [[Shwedagon]] in [[Yangon]], [[Myanmar]] is one of the largest and most holy stupas.

===European stupas===
{{also|Buddhism in Europe}}
The [[Benalmádena Stupa]] is the largest stupa in Europe. It is {{convert|33|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and was inaugurated on 5 October 2003, the final project of Buddhist master [[Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche]]. Rinpoche built his first stupa at [[Kalachakra stupa#Stupa in Karma Guen, Spain, 1994|Karma Guen]] near [[Malaga]] in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karmaguen.org/ Karma Guen]&lt;/ref&gt; a symbol of peace and prosperity for Spain. Rinpoche went on to build 16 more stupas in Europe before his death in 2003. 

A stupa was built on the ground of the Kalachakra Kalapa Centre in southwest [[Styria]], [[Austria]], between 2000 and 2002.

A stupa based on the bell shaped stupas at [[Borobudur|Boropodur]], Central Java, is located at [[Amaravati Buddhist Monastery]] near [[Hemel Hempstead]] in the United Kingdom. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buddhamind.info/leftside/arty/progress/stupas.htm|title=Stupa construction at Amaravati Buddhist Monastery|last=friends|first=Venerable Kusalo Bhikkhu - with help from his teachers and|website=www.buddhamind.info|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Built for a variety of reasons, Buddhist stupas are classified based on form and function into five types:&lt;ref name="Phuoc2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Le Huu Phuoc|title=Buddhist Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA140|accessdate=8 December 2011|date=March 2010|publisher=Grafikol|isbn=978-0-9844043-0-8|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Relic stupa''', in which the relics or remains of the Buddha, his disciples, and lay saints are interred.
* '''Object stupa''', in which the items interred are objects belonged to the Buddha or his disciples, such as a begging bowl or robe, or important Buddhist scriptures.
* '''Commemorative stupa''', built to commemorate events in the lives of Buddha or his disciples.
* '''Symbolic stupa''', to symbolise aspects of Buddhist theology; for example, Borobudur is considered to be the symbol of "the Three Worlds (''dhatu'') and the spiritual stages (''bhumi'') in a Mahayana ''bodhisattva's'' character."&lt;ref name="Phuoc2010"/&gt;
* '''Votive stupa''', constructed to commemorate visits or to gain spiritual benefits, usually at the site of prominent stupas which are regularly visited.

==Symbolism==
[[File:Grand Palace Bangkok.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Wat Phra Kaew]] complex from the northeast, temple complex of the Emerald Buddha with stupas.]]

"The shape of the stupa represents the Buddha, crowned and sitting in meditation posture on a lion throne. His crown is the top of the spire; his head is the square at the spire's base; his body is the vase shape; his legs are the four steps of the lower terrace; and the base is his throne."&lt;ref name="SINTRO"&gt;{{cite web | title=Introduction to stupas | url=http://www.stupa.org.nz/stupa/intro.htm | publisher=stupa.org | accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Five purified elements===
Although not described in any Tibetan text on stupa symbolism, the stupa may represent the five purified elements:&lt;ref name="Beer"/&gt;

* The square base represents earth
* The hemispherical dome/vase represents water
* The conical spire represents fire
* The upper lotus parasol and the crescent moon represent air
* The sun and the dissolving point represent the element of space

==Construction==
To build a stupa, [[Dharma transmission]] and ceremonies known to a [[Lama|Buddhist teacher]] are necessary.&lt;ref name="KUC"/&gt; The type of stupa to be constructed in a certain area is decided together with the teacher assisting in the construction. Sometimes the type is chosen directly connected with events that have taken place in the area.&lt;ref name="KUC"&gt;{{cite web | title=Miracle Stupa - Stupa | url=http://www.stupa.pl/en_stupa.html | publisher=stupa.pl | accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Buddha relics.JPG|thumb|Buddha relics from [[Kanishka stupa|Kanishka's stupa]] in [[Peshawar]], Pakistan. These surviving relics are now housed in [[Mandalay]], Myanmar.]]

===Treasury===
All stupas contain a treasury filled with various objects. Small clay votive offerings called ''tsatsa''s in Tibetan fill most of the treasury. Creation of various types of tsatsas is a ceremony itself. Mantras written on paper are rolled into thin rolls and put into small clay stupas.&lt;ref name="KUC"/&gt; One layer of tsatsas is placed in the treasury, and the empty space between them is filled with dry sand. On the thus created new surface, another layer of tsatsas is made, and so on until the entire space of the treasury is full.&lt;ref name="KUC"/&gt;

The number of tsatsas required to completely fill the treasury depends on its size and the size of the tsatsa. For example, the [[Kalachakra stupa]] in southern [[Spain]] contains approximately 14,000 tsatsas.&lt;ref name="KUC"/&gt;

[[Jewellery]] and other "precious" objects are also placed in the treasury. It is not necessary that they be expensive, since it is the symbolic value that is important, not the market price.&lt;ref name="KUC"/&gt; It is believed that the more objects placed into the stupa, the stronger the energy of the stupa.&lt;ref name="KUC"/&gt;

===Tree of Life===
An important element in every stupa is the "Tree of Life". This is a wooden pole covered with gems and thousands of mantras; it is placed in the central channel of the stupa.&lt;ref name="KUC"/&gt; It is positioned during a ceremony or initiation, where the participants hold colorful ribbons connected to the Tree of Life. Together, the participants make their most positive and powerful wishes, which are stored in the Tree of Life. In this way the stupa is charged, and starts to function.&lt;ref name="KUC"/&gt;

===Benefits===
Building a stupa is considered extremely beneficial, leaving very positive [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic]] imprints in the mind. Future benefits from this action result in fortunate rebirths. Fortunate worldly benefits will be the result, such as being born into a rich family, having a beautiful body, a nice voice, being attractive, bringing joy to others, and having a long and happy life in which one's wishes are quickly fulfilled.&lt;ref name="SBEN"&gt;{{cite web | title=Benefits Resulting from the Building of Stupas | url=http://www.stupa.org.nz/stupa/benefit.htm | publisher=stupa.org | accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the absolute level, one will also be able quickly to reach [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], the goal of Buddhism.&lt;ref name="SBEN"/&gt;

Destroying a stupa, on the other hand, is considered an extremely negative deed, similar to killing.&lt;ref name="LTR4"&gt;Article: Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche: ''The Four Thoughts which Turn the Mind from Samsara.'' BUDDHISM TODAY, Vol.5, 1998. [http://www.diamondway-teachings.org/export/en/content/advanced/tsechu_4thougths.html Available online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303093029/http://www.diamondway-teachings.org/export/en/content/advanced/tsechu_4thougths.html |date=2009-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an action is said to create massive negative [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic]] imprints, leading to serious future problems. It is said this action leaves the mind in a state of paranoia after death has occurred, leading to totally unfortunate rebirths.&lt;ref name="LTR4"/&gt;

==Tibetan stupas==
[[File:Eight great stupas.svg|thumb|left|The Eight Great Stupas]]
[[File:Miaoyingsi baita.jpg|thumb|left|The white stupa in [[Miaoying Temple]], [[China]]]]
{{Buddhism|collapsed=1}}
Stupas in [[Tibet]] and [[Bhutan]] are usually called '''chorten''' in English, reflecting the term in the [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan language]]. There are eight different kinds of stupas in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], each referring to major events in the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s life.&lt;ref name="Beer"/&gt;

===Lotus Blossom Stupa===
Also known as "Stupa of Heaped Lotuses" or "Birth of the Sugata Stupa," this stupa refers to the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]]. "At birth Buddha took seven steps in each of the four directions"&lt;ref name="Beer"&gt;Beer, Robert: The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs (2004) Serindia Publications Inc. {{ISBN|1-932476-10-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (East, South, West and North). In each direction lotuses sprang up, symbolizing the [[brahmavihara|brahmavihāras]]: love, compassion, joy and equanimity. The base of this stupa is circular and has four steps, and it is decorated with lotus-petal designs. Occasionally, seven heaped lotus steps are constructed. These refer to the seven first steps of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Beer"/&gt;

===Enlightenment Stupa===
[[File:Ogoy Stupa 1 1600x1200.JPG|thumb|left|Enlightenment Stupa at [[Ogoy Island]], [[Russia]]]]
Also known as the "Stupa of the Conquest of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]", this stupa symbolizes the 35-year-old [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s attainment of enlightenment under the bodhi tree in [[Bodh Gaya]], where he conquered worldly temptations and attacks, manifesting in the form of Mara.&lt;ref name="Beer"/&gt;

===Stupa of Many Doors===
This stupa is also known as the "Stupa of Many Gates". After reaching enlightenment, the Buddha taught his first students in a deer park near [[Sarnath]]. The series of doors on each side of the steps represents the first teachings: the [[Four Noble Truths]], the Six [[Pāramitā]]s, the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] and the [[Twelve Nidānas]].&lt;ref name="Beer"/&gt;

===Stupa of Descent from the God Realm===
At 42 years of age, Buddha spent a summer retreat in the [[Tushita|Tuṣita Heaven]] where his mother had taken rebirth. In order to repay her kindness he taught the dharma to her rebirth. Local inhabitants built a stupa in [[Sankassa]] in order to commemorate this event. This type of stupa is characterized by having a central projection at each side containing a triple ladder or steps.&lt;ref name="Beer"/&gt;

===Stupa of Great Miracles===
Also known as the "Stupa of Conquest of the [[Tirthika]]s", this stupa refers to various miracles performed by the Buddha when he was 50 years old. Legend claims that he overpowered ''maras'' and heretics by engaging them in intellectual arguments and also by performing miracles. This stupa was raised by the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Lichavi]] kingdom to commemorate the event.&lt;ref name="Beer"/&gt;

===Stupa of Reconciliation===
This stupa commemorates the Buddha's resolution of a dispute among the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]. A stupa in this design was built in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], where the reconciliation occurred. It has four octagonal steps with equal sides.&lt;ref name="Beer"/&gt;

===Stupa of Complete Victory===
This stupa commemorates Buddha's successful prolonging of his life by three months. It has only three steps, which are circular and unadorned.&lt;ref name="Beer"/&gt;

===Stupa of Nirvana===
This stupa refers to the death of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] when he was 80 years old. It symbolizes his complete absorption into the highest state of mind. It is bell-shaped and usually unornamented.&lt;ref name="Beer"/&gt;

==Kalachakra stupa==
{{Main article|Kalachakra stupa}}

A ninth kind of stupa exists, the [[Kalachakra stupa]]. Its symbolism is not connected to events in the Buddha's life, but instead to the symbolism of the [[Kalachakra Tantra]], created to protect against negative energies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kalachakra Stupa |url=http://www.karmaguen.org/stupa_kalachakra_en.html |publisher=karmaguen.org |accessdate=2009-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205055317/http://www.karmaguen.org/stupa_kalachakra_en.html |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swat District==
[[Swat District]] is a small place with a large number of ancient stupas. The largest stupa of the Indian subcontinent is in Shingardar.

{{Japanese name|Sugawara}}
{{nihongo|'''Sugawara no Michizane'''|菅原 道真/菅原 道眞|extra=August 1, 845 – March 26, 903}}, also known as {{nihongo|'''Kan Shōjō'''|菅丞相}} or {{nihongo|'''Kanke'''|菅家}}, was a [[scholar]], [[poet]], and [[politician]] of the [[Heian Period]] of [[Japan]]. He is regarded as an excellent poet, particularly in [[Kanshi poetry]], and is today revered in [[Shinto]] as the god of learning, {{nihongo|'''[[Tenjin (kami)|Tenman-Tenjin]]'''|天満天神||extra=often shortened to '''[[Tenjin (kami)|Tenjin]]'''}}.

==Biography==
[[File:Tenjin Crossing to China.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Tenjin (Michizane) Crossing to China, late 15th century by Sesshin, Muromachi period, Ink on paper]]
He was born into a family of scholars, who bore the [[Kabane|hereditary title]] of {{nihongo|'''[[Ason]]'''|朝臣||}} which predated the [[Ritsuryō]] System and its ranking of members of the Court. His grandfather, [[Sugawara no Kiyotomo]], served the court, teaching history in the national school for future bureaucrats and even attained the third rank. His father, [[Sugawara no Koreyoshi]], began a private school in his mansion and taught students who prepared for the entrance examination to the national school or who had ambitions to be officers of the court, including his own son Michizane.

Michizane passed the entrance examination, and entered Daigaku, as the national academy was called at the time. After graduation he began his career in the court as a scholar as a relatively prestigious senior sixth rank upper in 870.&lt;ref name="borgen1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Borgen | first = Robert | title = Sugawara no Michizane and the Early Heian Court | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-8248-1590-5 | pages=113–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His rank coincided with his role initially as a minor official in the Court bureaucracy under the [[Ministry of Civil Administration|Ministry of Civil Affairs]].  By 874 Michizane had reached the fifth rank (his father the fourth rank), and served briefly under the Ministry of War before being transferred to a more desirable role in the [[Ministry of Popular Affairs]].&lt;ref name="borgen1" /&gt;  His training and skill with [[Classical Chinese]] language and literature afforded him many opportunities to draft edicts and correspondences for officials in the Court in addition to his menial duties. Records show at this time he composed three petitions for [[Fujiwara no Yoshifusa]] as well as the Emperor.&lt;ref name="borgen1" /&gt;  Michizane also took part in receiving delegations from the Kingdom of [[Parhae]], where Michizane's skill with Chinese again proved useful in diplomatic exchanges and poetry exchange.  In 877, he was assigned to the Ministry of the Ceremonial, which allowed him to manage educational and intellectual matters more than before.

In addition to his offices at the court he ran the school his father founded, the {{nihongo|'''Kanke Rōka'''|菅家 廊下||lit. "Sugawara Family Hall"}}. In 877, he was also promoted to professor of literature at the academy, Later, he was also appointed {{nihongo|''Doctorate of Literature''|文章博士|monjō hakushi|}} the highest professorial office at Daigaku. This office was considered to be the highest honor a historian could achieve.

In 886, Sugawara was appointed to be governor of [[Sanuki Province]]. Modern research shows that many bureaucrats in the Court, if they lacked sufficient clout, were assigned at least one term in a remote province, and Michizane was no exception.  During his four-year tenure in the province, Michizane's informal poetry increased, and up to 26% of his poetry still extant was composed in this narrow time.&lt;ref name="borgen2"&gt;{{cite book | last = Borgen | first = Robert | title = Sugawara no Michizane and the Early Heian Court | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-8248-1590-5 | pages=158–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his duties, based on limited records, was to tour the province, recommend outstanding individuals to the Court, and to punish as needed.  In 887, Michizane had to petition the Buddhas and the Shinto [[kami]] to help relieve a drought at the time.  Records of the time imply that Michizane's time as governor had met with only middling success.&lt;ref name="borgen2" /&gt;

While serving as governor, a political conflict arose between [[Emperor Uda]] and [[Fujiwara no Mototsune]] called the {{nihongo|'''Akō Incident'''|阿衡事件|akō jiken|}} in 888 over Mototsune's unclear role in the Court after Emperor Uda's ascension.  Michizane, defending the court scholars sent a letter of censure to Mototsune, and gained the favor of Emperor Uda.  With his term as governor completed in 890, Michizane returned to the Court in [[Kyoto]].  In Emperor Uda's struggles to restore power to the Imperial Family, away from the Fujiwara, a number of officials from non-Fujiwara families were promoted to key positions, including Imperial offshoots in the [[Minamoto]] family and Sugawara no Michizane.  In a rapid series of promotions beginning in 891, Michizane rose to the senior third rank in 897.  According to one document signed by Michizane in 894, he already held the following posts in the Court:&lt;ref name="borgen3"&gt;{{cite book | last = Borgen | first = Robert | title = Sugawara no Michizane and the Early Heian Court | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-8248-1590-5 | pages=201–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ambassador to the [[Tang Dynasty]].
* Consultant
* Assistant Investigator of the Records of Outgoing Officials
* Junior Fourth Rank Lower
* Major Controller of the Left
* Supernumerary Senior Assistant Minister of Ceremonial
* Assistant Master of the Crown Prince's Household (later [[Emperor Daigo]])

He was appointed ambassador to China in the 890s, but instead came out in support of abolition of the [[imperial embassies to China]] in 894, theoretically in consideration for the decline of the [[Tang Dynasty]]. A potential ulterior motive may have lain in Michizane's almost complete ignorance of spoken Chinese; most literate Japanese at the time only read Chinese, and knew little to nothing about the spoken language. Michizane, as the nominated ambassador to China, would have been presented with a potential loss of face had he been forced to depend on an interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, I. (1975).  ''The Nobility of Failure: Tragic Heroes in the History of Japan.'' p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the abdication of Emperor Uda, Michizane's position became increasingly vulnerable.  In 901, through the political maneuverings of his rival, [[Fujiwara no Tokihira]], Michizane was demoted from his aristocratic rank of junior second to a minor official post at [[Dazaifu (region)|Dazaifu]], in [[Kyūshū]]'s [[Chikuzen Province]], and died in exile. After Michizane's death, [[pandemic|plague]] and [[drought]] spread and sons of [[Emperor Daigo]] died in succession. The Imperial Palace's Great Audience Hall (''shishinden'') was struck repeatedly by lightning, and the city experienced weeks of rainstorms and floods. Attributing this to the angry spirit of the exiled Sugawara, the imperial court built a [[Shinto shrine]] called [[Kitano Tenman-gū]] in Kyoto, and dedicated it to him. They posthumously restored his title and office, and struck from the record any mention of his exile. Even this was not enough, and 70 years later Sugawara was deified as [[Tenjin (kami)|Tenjin-sama]], or ''[[kami]]'' of scholarship. Today many Shinto shrines in Japan are dedicated to him.

[[Emperor Uda]] stopped the practice of sending ambassadors to China. The emperor's decision-making was informed by what he understood as persuasive counsel from Sugawara Michizane.&lt;ref&gt;Kitagawa, H. (1975). ''The Tale of the Heike,'' p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==
Michizane had an exceptional talent in poetry both for ''[[kanshi (poetry)|kanshi]]'' (poetry in Chinese) and ''[[waka (poetry)|waka]]'' (poetry in Japanese).

His primary interest was ''kanshi'', because in those days the immersion in the Chinese culture was regarded as a proof of refinement and scholarship. Since his excellence in ''kanshi'' was well known throughout the Court, [[Emperor Daigo]] suggested him to compile his Chinese poems, and therefore he published {{nihongo|[[Kanke Bunsō]]|菅家文草||extra="Chinese poetry by Sugawara no Michizane"}} and dedicated it to the emperor in 900. After his exile he continued to work on ''kanshi'' and compiled them into the {{nihongo|''[[Kanke Kōshū]]''|菅家後集||extra="later anthology of Sugawara no Michizane"}}.&lt;ref name="Keene 197"&gt;Keene 1999 : 197.&lt;/ref&gt; The work contained 46 ''kanshi'', was completed sometime before his death in 903.&lt;ref name="Koshu"&gt;''Digital Daijisen'' entry "Kanke Kōshū". Shogakukan.&lt;/ref&gt; He sent it to {{nihongo|[[Ki no Haseo]]|紀長谷雄}} right before his death.&lt;ref name="Koshu"/&gt;

One of his poems was included as #24 in [[Fujiwara no Teika]]'s ''[[Ogura Hyakunin Isshu]]'':

[[File:Dazaifu Tenmangu Plum Tree 2004-03-07.jpg|right|thumb|''tobi-ume'' or the "flying plum" at [[Dazaifu Tenman-gū]]]]
Another of his famous waka is a poem written in 901 just before he left Kyoto for Daizaifu by demotion. He felt deep sorrow that he would never see his precious plum tree in his residence in Kyoto again, so he talked endearingly to it:
{{waka
|東風吹かば　にほひをこせよ　梅花|主なしとて　春を忘るな
|reading = kochi fukaba / nioi okose yo / ume no hana / aruji nashi tote / haru o wasuru na
|translation = loosely: When the east wind blows, flourish in full bloom, you, plum blossoms! Even though you lose your master, don't be oblivious to spring. (Note: ''nioi okose yo'' can be interpreted as ''spread your scent'' rather than ''flourish in full bloom'', although such a usage of the word ''nioi'' as ''scent'' or ''smell'' is relatively modern and rare in the classical period)
|source = [[Shūi Wakashū]] 16:1006.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;although above is the original form of this poem, when re-collected later in [[Hōbutsushū]], the last phrase was modified into ''haru na wasure so'' (its meaning remains unchanged), which became its popular variation).&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

A romantic legend says the plum tree was so fond of its master that it finally flew to Dazaifu, and that tree became known as {{nihongo|''tobi-ume''|[[:ja:飛梅|飛梅]]|'the flying plum'}} at [[Dazaifu Tenman-gū]] (a shrine dedicated to its master). A more realistic legend says Michizane or his friend transplanted its seedling to Dazaifu.

Michizane is traditionally credited with the ''[[Shinsen Man'yōshū]]'', but the attribution has been challenged.&lt;ref name="Keene 239-15"&gt;Keene 1999 : 239, note 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descendants==
The lineage of the Sugawara clan was divided into six families by the 18th century. Aside from these noble families, there are several (often self-proclaimed) branches in the [[samurai]] caste, including [[Maeda clan|Maeda]] and [[Yagyū clan|Yagyū]].

* Sugawara no Takasue (972 – ?)- an aristocrat, Michizane's great-grandson.
** [[Takasue's daughter]] (c.1008 – after 1059) - a female writer known for ''[[Sarashina Nikki]]''.
* Aristocratic families (Takatsuji, Gojō, Higashibōjō, Karahashi, Kiyooka, and Kuwabara)
** [[Takako Irie]] (1911 – 1995) - an actress, a daughter of Viscount Yoshinaka Higashibōjō.

'''Tamil mythology''' means the stories and sacred narratives belonging to the [[Tamil people]]. This body of [[mythology]] is a mix of elements from the [[Tamil culture]], [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian culture]] and [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] cultures along with the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religious aspects.

==The Tamil Gods==
The [[Tamil literature]] in parallel with the [[Sanskrit]] literature formed a major source of information on Hindu culture. The ancient Tamil epics forms the source of various historical figures in Hindu scripture like [[Agastya]], [[Iravan]], [[Patanjali]] etc. [[Tamil literature|Ancient Tamil literature]] is the source of Tamil deities like [[Murugan]] and '''Kotravai''', Tamil literature forms the source of history of [[Nataraja]], [[Meenakshi]], [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple|Tirupati]], [[Rameswaram]].

===San Murugan===
{{Main|Kartikeya}}
{{Hinduism}}
{{see also|Arupadaiveedu}}
{{Hatnote|Other names: Arumugam, sanmugam, singara velan, kathireshan, Karikeyan, Senani, Subramani and Tamizh mupaten.}}
'''Murugan''' ({{lang-ta|முருகன்}}), also known as '''Kartikeya''', is the Hindu god of war and victory, worshiped primarily in areas with [[Tamil people|Tamil]] influences, especially [[South India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Mauritius]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Reunion Island]]. His six most important shrines in India are the [[Arupadaiveedu]] temples, located in [[Tamil Nadu]]. In [[Sri Lanka]], [[Hindu]]s as well as [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] revere the sacred historical [[Nallur Kandaswamy temple]] in [[Jaffna]] and [[Kataragama temple|Katirkāmam Temple]] (also in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] "Katharagama Devalaya") situated deep south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2008/06/080611_muruga.shtml|title=Rare Sri Lankan idol recovered|work=BBC News|date=11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic Tamils in [[Malaysia]] also pray to Lord Murugan at the [[Batu Caves]] temple and [[Thaipusam]] is celebrated with grandeur.

In a complicated story, he is said to have been born from Agni and [[Svāha]], after the latter impersonated the six of the seven wives of the [[Saptarishi]] (Seven Sages). The actual wives then become the Pleiades. Karthikeya is said to have been born to destroy the [[Asura]] [[Mahisha]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mahabharata]], ''Aranyaka Parva'', Section 230 of the vulgate translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli (1883–1896)
&lt;/ref&gt; (In later mythology, Mahisha became the adversary of [[Durga]].) [[Indra]] attacks Karthikeya as he sees the latter as a threat, until Shiva intervenes and makes Karthikeya the commander-in-chief of the army of the Devas. He is also married to Devasena, Indra's daughter. The origin of this marriage lies probably in the punning of 'Deva-sena-pati'. It can mean either lord of Devasena or Lord of the army (sena) of Devas.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

===Ayyappan===
{{main|Ayyappan}}
{{see also|Sabarimala}}
({{lang-ml|അയ്യപ്പന്‍}}),({{lang-ta|ஐயப்பன்}}) (also called '''Sastavu''', or '''[[Shasta (deity)|Sasta]]''') is a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity worshiped in a number of shrines across [[India]]. Ayyappan is believed to be an incarnation of [[Dharmasasta|Dharma Sasta]], who is the offspring of [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]] (as [[Mohini]], is the only female avatar of the God Vishnu) and is generally depicted in a [[Yoga|yogic posture]], wearing a jewel around his neck, hence named Manikandan. Ayyappan may bear a historical relationship to the [[tutelary deity]] [[Aiyanar]] in [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ayyappan." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2011. Web. 23 Dec. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[asura]] princess Mahishi was burning up with anger at the trick the gods had pulled on her brother, the asura king [[Mahishasura]]. As Mahishasura was blessed with invulnerability to all men, the gods had sent goddess [[Durga]], to fight and kill him. Thus, Mahishi began performing a fearsome set of austerities, and pleased the creator god [[Brahma]]. She asked for the boon of invulnerability, but Brahma said it was not possible so Mahishi planned and asked invulnerability to all men except by the son of Shiva and Vishnu (Both are male &amp;  no possibility to give birth to any one). He granted her the boon of ruling the universe and being invulnerable except by the son of Shiva and Vishnu. Since such a person did not exist, she thought she was safe and began conquering and plundering the world.

The gods implored Shiva and Vishnu to save them from this catastrophe. Vishnu found a possible solution to the problem. When Vishnu had taken on the [[Kurma]] Avatar, he also had to manifest himself as [[Mohini]], the enchantress, to save the nectar of immortality (ambrosia or amrit) from the demons who were not willing to share it with the gods. If he became Mohini again, then the female Mohini and the male Shiva could have the divine child who would combine their powers and beat Mahishi.

Some versions give a slightly more detailed version of the union of Shiva with Vishnu. One version tells that the asura Bhasmasura had so pleased Lord Shiva with his austerities that Shiva gave him a boon of anything he wished. So Bhasmasura asked for the ability to burn to ashes anything which he placed his hand over. No sooner had Shiva granted this, than Bhasmasura ran after the god, threatening to turn him to ashes.

Shiva called to Lord Vishnu for help. He hide himself in a peepal tree as Bhasmasura ran here and there searching for the god. Vishnu became aware of the events, and decided that he would take the female form Mohini, "the Enchanting", and try to trump the asura's powers. When Bhasmasura saw Vishnu in this form, he was bewitched by her beauty. He earnestly tried to court her. So Vishnu instructed Bhasmasura to hold his hand over his head, and vow fidelity. With this act, Bhasmasura was reduced to ashes.

Vishnu found Shiva and explained the whole affair to him. Shiva asked if he too could see Vishnu in this female form. When Vishnu appeared thus, Shiva was overcome with passion, and united with her. The two gods thus became "[[Harihara|Harihara Murthi]]", that is a composite form of Shiva and Vishnu as one god.

From this union, Lord Sree Dharma Sastha was born. He combined in himself the powers of Vishnu and Shiva. Lord Ayyappan is an incarnation of Lord Sree Dharma Sastha and Lord Ayyappan is a visible embodiment of their essential identity. Sri Ayyappa belongs to Pandya Royal Community. He was the head of a clan. It is believed Sri Ayyappa merged to sri dharma sastha. Lord Vishnu gifted the new-born deity with a little bejeweled bell necklace, so this god is called Manikandan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hinduism.about.com/od/godsgoddesses/a/Lord-Ayyappa.htm|title=Why Ayyappa is called Manikandan}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also Known as Dharma Shasthavu, Kerala Puthran.

===Thirumal===
{{Main|Thirumal}}
{{see also|Divya Desam|Pancharanga Kshetrams}}
'''Perumal''' ({{lang-ta|பெருமாள்}}) also '''Thirumal''' ({{lang-ta|திருமால்}}) is the [[Hindu]] [[deity]] most popular amongst [[Tamil people|Tamil]]s of [[Tamil Nadu]] state in [[India]] and in the [[Tamil diaspora]]. Perumal is another name of [[Vishnu]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

====Early mention in Sangam literature====
Tamil [[Sangam literature]] (200BCE to 500CE) mentions mAyOn, or the dark one, as the supreme deity who creates, sustains and destroys the universe.{{cn|date=January 2018}} Paripadal 3 describes the glory of Thirumal in the most superlative terms.

Paripadal(3)by kaduvan iLaveyinanAr:

"thIyinuL theRal nI poovinuL naaRRa nI kallinuL maNiyu nI sollinuL vaaymai aRaththinuL anbu nI maRaththinuL mainthu nI
vEthaththu maRai nI boothaththu madhalu nI vencudar oLiyu nI thingaLuL aLiyu nI anaiththu nI anaiththinut poruLu nI"

The last line states that Thirumal  is the supreme deity who is the inner controller ([[Antaryamin]]) of the entire universe. This is one of the Lord's glories, which is first mentioned in Vedas and later propounded by Alwars in Prabhandams and Sri Vaishnavaite Acharyas in various commentaries.

==== Popularity in Tamil Nadu ====

Thirumal (Vishnu) is the only deity who has enjoyed the status of Paramporul during the [[Sangam period|Sangam]] age. The reference to "Mukkol Bhagavars" in Sangam literature clearly indicates that only Vaishnavaite saints holding Tridanda existed during the sangam age and Thirumal was glorified as the supreme deity whose divine lotus feet can burn all our evils and grant Moksha (Maru Piraparukkum Maasil Sevadi). During the post-Sangam period, his worship was further glorified by the alwars and great [[Vaishnavite]] [[acharyas]].

=== Natraja of Chidambaram ===
{{Main|Nataraja}}
{{see also|Pancha Sabhai}}
The story of Chidambaram begins with Lord Shiva strolling into the Thillai Vanam (''vanam'' meaning forest and ''thillai'' trees - botanical name ''[[Excoecaria|Exocoeria agallocha]]'', a species of mangrove trees - which currently grows in the [[Pichavaram]] wetlands near Chidambaram). In the Thillai forests resided a group of sages or '[[rishis]]' who believed in the supremacy of magic and that God can be controlled by rituals and ''mantras'' or magical words.&lt;ref name="Anand"&gt;Anand 2004, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Shiva strolled in the forest with resplendent beauty and brilliance, assuming the form of [[Bhikshatana]], a simple mendicant seeking alms. He was followed by His consort, Vishnu as [[Mohini]]. The sages and their wives were enchanted by the brilliance and the beauty of The handsome mendicant and His consort.  On seeing their womenfolk enchanted, the rishis got enraged and invoked scores of serpents (''[[nāgas]]'') by performing magical rituals. Lord Shiva lifted the serpents and donned them as ornaments on His matted locks, neck and waist. Further enraged, the sages invoked a fierce tiger, whose skins and dons were used by Lord Shiva as a shawl around His waist and then followed by a fierce elephant, which was devoured and ripped to death by Lord Shiva (Gajasamharamurthy).

The rishis gathered all their spiritual strength and invoked a powerful demon Muyalakan - a symbol of complete arrogance and ignorance. Lord Shiva wore a gentle smile, stepped on the demon's back, immobilized him and performed the ''Ánanda Tandava'' (the dance of eternal bliss) and disclosed his true form. The sages surrender, realizing that Lord Shiva is the truth and He is beyond magic and rituals.&lt;ref name="Anand"/&gt;

===Meenakshi===
{{Main|Meenakshi}}
{{see also|Meenakshi Amman Temple}}
[[Image:Gopuram-madurai.jpg|thumb|left|One of the [[Gopuram]] of [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]] at [[Madurai]]]]

Once [[Indra]] killed a demon, even though the demon did not harm anyone. This act brought a curse upon Indra that forced him to continue wandering until he was walking around looking for a way where no one would tell him which way to go will redeem him from his [[sin]]. After much wandering, Indra was freed from his suffering through the power of a [[Lingam|Shivalingam]] in a [[forest]], and so he built a small [[temple]] at that site.

It so happened that at that time in [[South India]] there was a [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandya]]n [[Monarch|king]] called Malayadhwaja Pandiyan&lt;ref&gt;[[Pandya Kingdom#Pandyas in Kurukshetra War]]&lt;/ref&gt; ruling a small city by the name ''Manavur'', which was quite near to this Shivalinga. He was the son of ''Kulashekara'' Pandyan. He came to know about the Shivalinga and decided to build a huge temple for Shiva in the forest ''Kadambavanam'' (''vanam'' means forest). He also developed the region into a fine princely state called [[Madurai]].

The king was childless and sought an heir for the [[monarchy|kingdom]]. Shiva granted him his prayers through an ''Ayonija'' child (one born not from the womb). This child was three years old and actually the incarnation of goddess [[Parvati]] the consort of [[Shiva]]. She was born with fish-shaped eyes. It was said that the extra breast would disappear when she met her future husband. She was named ''Mīnachchi'', (meaning ''fish eyed'') from the words ''mīna'' (meaning fish) and ''akṣi'' (meaning eyes). Mīnakshi also means "the one who has eyes like that of a fish". Fishes are said to feed their younger ones with their eyes, similarly goddess looks after her devotees. Just by her sight our miseries disappear.

[[Image:Nataraja.jpg|thumb|Shiva the [[Nataraja]] performing the Universal dance]]

She grew up to be a Shiva-Shakti personification. After the death of the king, she ruled the kingdom with skillful administration.

In one of her expeditions she went to the [[Himalayas]] and there, on seeing Shiva, her extra breast disappeared. Many of the gods and goddesses came to witness their marriage.

At the wedding celebrations the gods refused to have the served food unless Shiva performed a majestic dance for everybody gathered at the place. At this there was the dance of [[Chidambaram]], the ''cosmic dance'' in front of his wife Minakshi. It epitomised and merged all life force and beauty into one whole. In the end Minakshi was merged with the [[Lingam|shivalingam]] and became the representation of life and beauty.

There is another legend that talks about why the North Tower (called as "Mottai Gopuram") does not have that many sculptures. Bhootaganas were supposed to finish the construction of the temple towers during the night. Legend says that bhootaganas completed all three towers but while in the middle of building the north tower sunrise happened halting the completion of the north tower.
A Tamil poem shows the goddess Meenakshi as a girl washing crockery and pots (which consist of all the worlds). This is a daily task, because her husband Shiva repeatedly messes up the universe, which Minakshi must once more sort out and clean.

:''Shiva wanders through the courtyard of space
:''destroying your work again and again,
:''and then comes before you dancing.
:''You never get angry.
:''Every day, you just pick up the vessels. ''

In thirty words, Minakshi becomes a global icon for all who deal with 'impossible' children (or husbands).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Kannagi===
{{Main|Kannaki Amman}}
{{see|Silappatikaram}}
'''[[Kannagi]]''' or (Kannaki), a [[legend]]ary [[Tamil people|Tamil]] woman, is the central character of the [[South Indian]] [[Epic poetry|epic]] ''[[Silapadhigaaram|Silapathikaram]]'' (100-300 CE). The story relates how Kannagi took revenge on the [[Early Pandyan Kingdom|early Pandyan]] [[Nedunj Cheliyan I|King]] of [[Madurai]], for a mistaken death penalty imposed on her husband [[Kovalan]], by cursing the city with [[disaster]].
[[Image:Statue of Kannagi.jpg|thumb|Kannagi Statue in [[Marina Beach]], [[Chennai]]]]

[[Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple]] was built to commemorate the martyrdom of [[Kannagi]]. It is said that sixth avatar of [[Vishnu]], Sage [[Parasurama]] built this temple for the prosperity of the people. According to the old chronicles, this Bhagavathi temple was created in the heart of the town many centuries ago to serve a special purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Kodungallur Bhagavathy.jpg|thumb|left|Deity of Kodungallur Bhagavathy in the temple]]
Legend says that, after the creation of [[Kerala]] by [[Parasurama]], he was harassed by a demon called Daruka. To kill this evil demon, [[Parasurama]] prayed to Lord [[Shiva]] for help. As advised by Shiva, Parasurama constructed the shrine and installed the Shakti Devi as Bhagavathi. The deity in the temple, it is believed, is Parashakthi herself. According to legends, it was Bhadrakali who killed the evil demon Daruka.
She is worshiped as goddess [[Pattini]] in [[Sri Lanka]] by the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] [[Buddhists]], Kannaki Amman by the [[Sri Lankan Tamil people|Sri Lankan Tamil]] [[Hindus|Hindus']] (See [[Hinduism in Sri Lanka]]) and as Kodungallur Bhagavathy and Attukal Bhagavathy in the South Indian state of Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;Shankar Radhakrishnan HAI

Kannagi is also viewed as a brave woman who could demand justice directly from the King and even dared to call him "unenlightened king" ("Thera Manna", Vazhakkurai Kathai, Silappathikaram).

==The Powerful Tamil Saints :The Siddhars==
{{Main|Siddhar}}
'''Siddhars''' (Tamil: சித்தர்) are saints in [[India]], mostly of the Saivaite denomination in [[Tamil Nadu]], who professed and practised an unorthodox type of [[Sadhana]], or spiritual practice, to attain liberation. Yogic powers called [[Siddhi]]s are acquired by constant practice of certain yogic disciplines. Those who acquire these Siddhis are called [[Siddhas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlshq.org/download/pranayama.pdf |title=The Science of Pranayama |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sidhars can be compared to [[Mysticism|Mystics]] of the western civilization.
Siddhars are people who are believed to control and transcend the barriers of time and space by meditation ([[Yoga]]), after the use of substances called [[Rasayanas]] that transform the body to make it potentially deathless, and a particular breathing-practice, a type of [[Pranayama]]. Through their practices they are believed to have reached stages of insight which enabled them to tune into the powers hidden in various material substances and practices, useful for suffering and ignorant mankind. Typically Siddhars were saints, doctors, alchemists and mysticists all at once. They wrote their findings, in the form of [[poem]]s in [[Tamil language]], on palm leaves which are collected and stored in what are known today as [[Palm leaf manuscript]], today still owned by private families in Tamil Nadu and handed down through the generations, as well as public institutions such as [[Universities]] all over the world (India, Germany, Great Britain, U.S.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=V.Jayaram |url=http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/essays/siddhas.asp |title=Study of siddhas |publisher=Hinduwebsite.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way Siddhars developed, among other branches of a vast knowledge-system, what is now known as [[Siddha]] medicine, practised mainly in Tamil Nadu as Traditional native [[medicine]]. A rustic form of healing that is similar to [[Siddha]] medicine has since been practised by experienced elderly in the villages of Tamil Nadu. (This has been misunderstood as ''Paatti Vaitthiyam, Naattu marunthu'' and ''Mooligai marutthuvam''. While paati vaitthiyam or naatu marunthu is traditional Tamil medicine and mooligai marutthuvam is ayurvedic medicine.) They are also founders of [[Varmam]] - a martial art for [[self-defence]] and medical treatment at the same time. [[Varmam]] are specific points located in the human body which when pressed in different ways can give various results, such as disabling an attacker in self-defence, or balancing a physical condition as an easy first-aid medical treatment.

Tamil Siddhars were the first to develop pulse-reading ("naadi paarththal" in Tamil) to identify the origin of diseases. This method was later copied and used in ayurvedha.&lt;ref&gt;Dr.J. Raamachandran, ''Herbs of Siddha Medicines'' Herbs of Siddha Medicine/The First [[3D book]] on Herbs, pp.iii&lt;/ref&gt;

Siddhars have also written many religious poems. It is believed that most of them have lived for ages, in a mystic mountain called Sathuragiri, near Thanipparai village in Tamil Nadu.

One of the best-known Siddhars was [[Agastyar|Agasthyar]] or [[Agasthya]], who is believed to be the founding father of Siddha culture.

[[Abithana Chintamani]] states Siddhars are either of the 9 or 18 persons enlisted, but sage [[Agastyar]] states that there are many who precede these and follow 9 or 18 persons. Many of the great Siddhars are regarded to have powers magical and spiritual.

=== Some Siddhars ===

====The 9 siddhars====
The 9 listed as Abithana Chintamani states is as follows:

#[[Sathyanathar]]
#
#[[Aadhinathar]]
#[[Bogar]]
#[[Vegulinathar]]
#[[Madhanganathar]]
#[[Matsyendranath|Machaendranathar]]
#[[Gadaendranathar]] or [[Gajendranathar]]
#[[Gorakshanath|Korakkanathar]]

There are totally 18 siddhars in the Tamil siddha tradition.see [[Siddhar]]

=== Powers of siddhars ===

The siddhars are believed to have had powers both major and other ‘minor’ powers. They are explained in detail in various yogic as well as religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;Thirumandiram 668&lt;/ref&gt; They also have the power converting their mass to energy and thereby travel in space in light speed to different universe.
# [[Anima (Yogic power)|Anima]] (shrinking) -- Power of becoming the size of an atom and entering the smallest beings
# [[Mahima]] (illimitability) -- Power of becoming mighty and co-extensive with the universe. The power of increasing one's size without limit
# [[Lagima]] (lightness) -- Capacity to be quite light though big in size
# [[Garima]] (weight) -- Capacity to weigh heavy, though seemingly small size
# [[Prapthi]] (fulfillment of desires) -- Capacity to enter all the worlds from [[Brahma Loga]] to the nether world. It is the power of attaining everything desired
# [[Prakasysm]] (irresistible will) -- Power of disembodying and entering into other bodies ([[metempsychosis]]) and going to heaven and enjoying what everyone aspires for, simply from where he stays
# [[Isithavam]] (supremacy) -- Have the creative power of god and control over the sun, the moon and the elements
# [[Vasithavam]] (dominion over the elements) -- Power of control over kings and gods. The power of changing the course of nature and assuming any form

These eight are the Great Siddhis (Ashtama siddhis), or [[eight great perfections|Great Perfections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siddhars.com/aboutus.htm |title=Ashtama Siddhis |publisher=Siddhars.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are scattered references in [[Sangam literature]], such as [[Kalittokai]] 104, to how the sea took the land of the [[Pandya Kingdom|Pandiyan]] kings, upon which they conquered new lands to replace those they had lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2004|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also references to the rivers Pahruli and Kumari, that are said to have flowed in a now-submerged land.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2000|p=584}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Silappadhikaram]], one of [[the Five Great Epics of Tamil Literature]] written in first few centuries [[Common Era|CE]], states that the "cruel sea" took the Pandiyan land that lay between the rivers Pahruli and the mountainous banks of the Kumari, to replace which the Pandiyan king conquered lands belonging to the Chola and Chera kings (Maturaikkandam, verses 17-22). Adiyarkkunallar, a 12th-century commentator on the epic, explains this reference by saying that there was once a land to the south of the present-day [[Kanyakumari district|Kanyakumari]], which stretched for 700 ''kavatam'' from the Pahruli river in the north to the Kumari river in the south. As the modern equivalent of a kavatam is unknown, estimates of the size of the lost land vary from {{convert|1400|mi|km}} to {{convert|7000|mi|km}} in length, to others suggesting a total ''area'' of 6-7,000 square miles, or smaller still an area of just a few villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ramaswamy|first=Sumathi|title=The lost land of Lemuria: fabulous geographies, catastrophic histories|year=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24440-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=elYyJuYuAhwC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=Kavatam+measurement#v=onepage&amp;q=kavatam&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This land was divided into 49 nadu, or territories, which he names as seven coconut territories (''elutenga natu''), seven Madurai territories (''elumaturai natu''), seven old sandy territories (''elumunpalai natu''), seven new sandy territories (''elupinpalai natu''), seven mountain territories (''elukunra natu''), seven eastern coastal territories (''elukunakarai natu'') and seven dwarf-palm territories (''elukurumpanai natu'').  All these lands, he says, together with the many-mountained land that began with KumariKollam, with forests and habitations, were submerged by the sea.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Two of these Nadus or territories were supposedly parts of present-day [[Kollam]] and [[Kanyakumari]] districts.

None of these texts name the land "Kumari Kandam" or "Kumarinadu", as is common today.  The only similar pre-modern reference is to a "Kumari Kandam" (written குமரிகண்டம், rather than குமரிக்கண்டம் as the land is called in modern Tamil), which is named in the medieval Tamil text ''Kantapuranam'' either as being one of the nine continents,&lt;ref&gt;Madras Tamil lexicon, [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:3074.tamillex குமரிகண்டம்]&lt;/ref&gt; or one of the nine divisions of India and the only region not to be inhabited by barbarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|2000|p=582}}&lt;/ref&gt;  19th and 20th century Tamil revivalist movements, however, came to apply the name to the territories described in Adiyarkkunallar's commentary to the Silappadhikaram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|1999|p97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also associated this territory with the references in the [[Tamil Sangams]], and said that the fabled cities of southern Madurai (Ten Madurai) and Kapatapuram where the first two Sangams were said to be held were located on Kumari Kandam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Lemuria Myth|url=http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2808/stories/20110422280809000.htm|accessdate=|newspaper=Frontline|date=9 April 2011|location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sangams may have overlapped in parallel to the third historic sangam; the second century BCE [[Tissamaharama Tamil Brahmi inscription]] detailing the ''thiraLi muRi'' (written agreement of the assembly) was excavated a few miles from the coast of the historic [[Tenavaram temple]], Matara, [[Sri Lanka]].

===Modern revival===
[[File:Kumari Kandam map.png|thumb|[[Kumari Kandam]], as identified with [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]]]]

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[Tamil nationalism|Tamil nationalists]] came to identify Kumari Kandam with [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], a "lost continent" posited in the 19th century to account for discontinuities in [[biogeography]].  In these accounts, Kumari Kandam became the "[[cradle of civilization]]",  the origin of human languages in general and the [[Tamil language]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indianfolklore.org/journals/index.php/IFRJ/article/view/178/183|title=Lost land and the myth of Kumari kandam|author=S.C.Jayakaran|year=2004|work= |publisher=Indian Folklore Research Journal|accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas gained notability in Tamil academic literature over the first decades of the 20th century, and were popularized by the [[Tanittamil Iyakkam]], notably by [[autodidactism|self-taught]] Dravidologist [[Devaneya Pavanar]], who held that all languages on earth were merely corrupted Tamil dialects.

R. Mathivanan, then Chief Editor of the Tamil Etymological Dictionary Project of the Government of Tamil Nadu, in 1991 claimed to have deciphered the still undeciphered [[Indus script]] as Tamil, following the methodology recommended by his teacher [[Devaneya Pavanar]], presenting the following timeline (cited after Mahadevan 2002):
:ca. [[Middle Paleolithic|200,000 to 50,000 BC]]: evolution of "the Tamilian or ''Homo Dravida''",
:ca. 200,000 to 100,000 BC: beginnings of the Tamil language
:50,000 BC: Kumari Kandam civilisation
:[[Upper Paleolithic|20,000 BC]]: A lost Tamil culture of the [[Easter Island]] which had an advanced civilisation
:16,000 BC: Lemuria submerged
:[[7th millennium BC|6087 BC]]: Second Tamil Sangam established by a Pandya king
:[[31st century BC|3031 BC]]: A Chera prince in his wanderings in the Solomon Islands saw wild sugarcane and started cultivation in Present Tamil nadu.
:1780 BC: The Third Tamil Sangam established by a Pandya king
:7th century BC: [[Tolkappiyam]] (the earliest known extant Tamil grammar)

===Popular culture===
* Kumari Kandam appeared in the episodes "The King of Kumari Kandam" and "The Atlas Pin" of ''[[The Secret Saturdays]]''. This version is a city on the back of a giant sea serpent with its inhabitants all fish people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5_yCu9lO6HsC |title=Google Books - The King of Kumari Kandam |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss and imagination===
Sumathi Ramaswamy's book, ''The Lost Land of Lemuria: Fabulous Geographies, Catastrophic Histories'' (2004) is a theoretically sophisticated study of the Lemuria legends that widens the discussion beyond previous treatments, looking at Lemuria narratives from nineteenth-century Victorian-era science to Euro-American occultism, colonial, and post colonial India. Ramaswamy discusses particularly how cultures process the experience of loss.

'''''The Prophecy of [[Mobhí Clárainech|Berchán]]''''' is a relatively long historical poem written in the [[Middle Irish language]]. The text is preserved in the [[Royal Irish Academy]] as MS 679 (23/G/4), with a few early modern copies. It is prophecy made in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. 

==Composition==
The text consists of 205 ''debide'' stanzas, two of which are corrupt (128, 168). It is divided into two parts. The reputed author of part one (stanzas 1-96) is an Irish abbot named [[Mobhí Clárainech|Berchán]], from whom the poem's name originates. Part one consists of a history of Berchán's own monastery, a recount of [[Viking]] attacks, and descriptions of the reigns of nineteen Irish kings. 

Part two (stanzas 97-206) is presented as an anonymous prophecy given around the death of [[Saint Patrick]] in the 5th century, prophesying the life of [[Columba]] and King [[Áedán mac Gabráin]], and 24 Scottish kings, from [[Kenneth MacAlpin|Cináed mac Ailpín]] (d. 858) to [[Donald III of Scotland|Domnall Bán]] (d. 1097). The poem is very indirect in its identification of Scottish kings, and uses a large number of obscure poetic images and similes. Unlike the Irish kings in part one, there are no accompanying glosses naming the kings. However, the Scottish kings spoken of can be identified, and the evidence made useful. The poem is one of the most important sources for Scottish history in the period it covers.

'''''The Utterly Utterly Merry Comic Relief Christmas Book''''' was a fundraising book issued on behalf of [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] in 1986. It was edited by [[Douglas Adams]] and [[Peter Fincham]] and contained contributions from Adams and many of the leading comedy writers and performers of the day.

== Contents ==

The book is of particular interest to fans of Douglas Adams' work as it contains several items written by him which are hard to find or exclusive to the collection. Besides the novella ''[[Young Zaphod Plays it Safe]]'' and the short story "[[The Private Life of Genghis Khan]]", which have since appeared in ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'', the book also contains Adams' short story "A Christmas Fairly Story" (written in collaboration with [[Terry Jones]]) and three supplements to  ''[[The Meaning of Liff]]''. 

Items by other authors include:
* ''Adrian Mole's Christmas'', an addition to [[Sue Townsend|Sue Townsend's]] ''[[Adrian Mole]]'' series (later included in ''[[The True Confessions of Adrian Albert Mole]]'').
* ''A New Decade of Heroic Failures'', an exclusive addition to [[Stephen Pile|Stephen Pile's]] ''[[The Book of Heroic Failures|Book of Heroic Failures]]''.
* Tie-ins to popular TV comedies of the day including ''[[Yes Minister]]'', ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' and ''[[Spitting Image]]''.

==Fundraising==

The book promised that profits would be distributed "80% to [[Save the children|SAVE THE CHILDREN FUND]] and [[Oxfam|OXFAM]] for famine relief and 20% to Charity Projects to support young people faced with the problems of drug abuse, homelessness and disability here in Britain."

==Censorship==

The book has never been reprinted following its initial print run, as a result of [[Censorship_by_organized_religion|religious censorship]]. 

In line with its Christmas theme the book contained several pieces based on the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] story, including:
* ''The Gospel According to a Sheep'' by [[Richard Curtis]] with additions by Douglas Adams. This tells the story of the nativity night from the point of view of a sheep that gets eaten as part of the celebrations, and therefore has a slightly jaundiced view of the whole affair.
* ''The Young Ones' Nativity Play'' in which the characters from ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' act out the nativity story in typically irreverent style.
* ''Jesus' Birthday'' in which Jesus is portrayed as a grumpy and mischievous child in a modern household.

[[Nicholas Winterton]] MP led a campaign to ask [[W.H. Smith]] not to stock the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Times Diary - Not so comic|date=December 3, 1986|publisher=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christian groups took offence, and attempted to get the book withdrawn.  They picketed bookshops and threatened to sue for blasphemy. Eventually they prevented the book from being reprinted by applying pressure on the publisher, [[HarperCollins|Collins]]. Collins held the rights to print certain versions of the Bible and it was threatened that these would be withdrawn. Douglas Adams complained that, as a result, considerably less money was raised for famine relief.

'''Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness''' ('''UUPA''') is an independent organization of [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalists]] seeking to promote greater understanding and acceptance of [[polyamory]] within the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] and its member congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uupa.org/index#mission |title=UUPA Website: Our Mission |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918233548/http://www.uupa.org/index#mission |archivedate=2017-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
UUPA's first official membership meeting was held at the 2001 General Assembly in Cleveland, electing a permanent Board of Trustees, ratifying incorporation and by-laws, and brainstorming on ideas and goals for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uupa.org/beginnings.htm |title=UUPA Website: UUPA's Beginnings }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UUPA continued to have a presence at annual General Assemblies, principally with information booths, but also holding formal workshops on polyamory at four GAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uupa.org/done.htm |title=UUPA Website: What We've Done }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, they released a curriculum on polyamory for congregations: "Love Makes a Family." At the 2014 General Assembly, two UUPA members moved to include the category of "family and relationship structures" in the UUA's nondiscrimination rule, along with other amendments; the package of proposed amendments was ratified by the GA delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |title=Unitarian Universalist Association: Rule II, Section C-2.3.: Non-discrimination |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518103753/http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |archivedate=2015-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While this has encouraged UUPA's membership, the UUA itself has yet to take specific action towards assuring greater awareness and inclusion of polyamorous people.

==Organization==
Members of the UUPA's Board of Trustees are democratically elected by the membership, which meets annually. The organization also has local chapters, as well as individual contact persons in some places where there is no active chapter present. While UUPA is independent of the UUA, it is currently listed as a "Related Organization" on the UUA website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uua.org/directory/organizations?category=11670 |title=UUA Directory: Related and Affiliate Organizations }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
UUPA provides presentations, educational materials and literature for Unitarian Universalist congregations, ministers and educators. Its leadership has also worked closely with other UU organizations, such as Interweave Continental (which works on [[LGBTQ]] issues within the UUA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interweavecontinental.ning.com/ |title=Interweave Continental website }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leather &amp; Grace]] (which promotes awareness among UUs on [[BDSM|BDSM and kink sexuality]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leatherandgrace.wordpress.com |title= Leather &amp; Grace website }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hildegard von Bingen.jpg|thumb|right|Illumination from [[Scivias|Liber Scivias]], showing [[Hildegard of Bingen]] receiving a vision, dictating to her scribe and sketching on a [[wax tablet]].]]

A '''vision''' is something seen in a [[dream]], [[trance]], or [[religious ecstasy]], especially a [[supernatural]] appearance that usually conveys a [[revelation]].{{R|"dictionary"}} Visions generally have more clarity than [[dream]]s, but traditionally fewer psychological connotations. Visions are known to emerge from spiritual traditions and could provide a lens into human nature and reality.{{R|"Schreuder2014"}} [[Prophecy]] is often associated with visions.

== About ==
[[Evelyn Underhill]] distinguishes and categorizes three types of visions:{{R|"Underhill"}}

# Intellectual Visons - The Catholic dictionary defines these as supernatural knowledge in which the mind receives an extraordinary grasp of some revealed truth without the aid of sensible impressions and mystics describe them as intuitions that leave a deep impression.{{R|"cathdefine"}}
# Imaginary - In Teresa of Avila's, ''The Interior Castle'' an imaginary vision is defined as one where nothing is seen or heard by the senses of seeing or hearing, but where the same impression is received that would be produced upon the imagination by the senses if some real object were perceived by them.{{R|"imaginary"}} Niels Christian Hvidt refers to them as visions recognized through mechanisms of the human psyche that are made up of things a soul has acquired through contact with reality.{{R|"Hvidt2007"}}
# Corporeal - A supernatural manifestation of an object to the eyes of the body. It may take place in two ways: either a figure really present strikes the retina and there determines the physical phenomenon of the vision, or an agent superior to man directly modifies the visual organ and produces in the composite a sensation equivalent to that which an external object would produce.{{R|"New_Advent"}} Underhill refers to this vision type as "little else than an uncontrolled externalization of inward memories, thoughts, or intuitions"{{R|"Underhill"}}

'''Ācāra''' ({{lang-sa|आचार}}) is a concept used in the context of [[Classical Hindu law]] that refers to the [[custom (law)|customary laws]] or community norms of a particular social group.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Jr. Donald R. Chapter One.&lt;/ref&gt;  These community norms are delineated and put into practice by people who have earned the respect of those within each individual group, such as a community leader or elder.  Although in [[Dharmaśāstra]] the ideal person who defines the ācāra of a particular place is dictated as one who knows the [[Vedas]] or is “learned”, in actual practice this role is often deferred to group leaders along with Vedic scholars.&lt;ref name="Davis, Jr. Donald R. Chapter Seven"&gt;Davis, Jr. Donald R. Chapter Seven&lt;/ref&gt;  Ācāra is theologically important in Hindu law because it is considered, along with the Vedas ([[Śruti]]), and [[Smriti]] (traditional texts such as the Dharmaśāstra literature), to be one of the sources of [[dharma]].&lt;ref name="Davis, Jr. Donald R. Chapter One"&gt;Davis, Jr. Donald R. Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt;  Particular regional ācāra is believed to be canonized in Dharmaśāstra texts; however scholars differ on the source for the actual accounts found within these texts.&lt;ref&gt;Lariviere, Richard W. 1997. pp. 612.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ācāra as customary law==
Customary law within the context of Hindu law is defined as akin to the community norm of a particular region.  This form of law encompasses laws that are actually applied to daily life, as opposed to theological laws canonized in texts which are accessible for only a small proportion of the population.&lt;ref name="Davis, Jr. Donald R. Chapter One"/&gt;  In this sense, customary law represents the actual practice of law in classical Hinduism, while laws found in the Vedas, {{IAST|smṛti}}, and śruti literature represent the theoretical practice.&lt;ref&gt;Lariviere, Richard W. 1997. pp. 623&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ācāra, however, is a particularly narrow scope of customary law.  What separates it as a category is that these laws are put into practice by people who hold a particular power over that set group.&lt;ref name="Davis, Jr. Donald R. Chapter Seven"/&gt; The power is determined by a theological connection to the divine through a full understanding of Vedic literature.  These people are also known in dharma literature as the sadācāra.&lt;ref name="Davis, Jr. Donald R. Chapter Seven"/&gt;  Although dharmasastra identifies the sadācāra as the ideal person for creating laws because they are so fluent with Vedic knowledge that the laws they choose to enforce are in line with the Vedas, in reality, the power to develop laws shifted over time from Vedic scholars to community leaders whose actions gained the respect of their fellow community members and were distinguished as "good people" even if they lacked direct knowledge of the Vedas.&lt;ref name="Hacker, Paul. 2006. pp. 484"&gt;Hacker, Paul. 2006. pp. 484&lt;/ref&gt;  

Eventually, even the laws penned by those not versed in the Vedas were connected back to Vedic literature. According to Mitramiśra, even the customs of [[Śudra]] are the dharma for Śudra.  This means that each particular group has a different individual dharma they must fulfill.  Therefore, as long as the practices of a leader are considered in line with the customs of the community, they are still considered to be pursuing their dharma and therefore are still connected to the Vedas.&lt;ref name="Lariviere, Richard W 1997. pp. 618"&gt;Lariviere, Richard W. 1997. pp. 618&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sadācāra ==
According to the [[Mimamsa]] scholar Kumārila, "when good people act according to certain rules and no motive or goal is apparent in the realm of the observable, then this is to be understood as dharma."&lt;ref name="Hacker, Paul. 2006. pp. 484"/&gt;  The "good people" of this definition represent the sadācāra.  The "sad" of sadācāra is translated as good which causes sadācāra to translate as the "standards of the good (people)".&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Jr. Donald R. Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;  Sadācāra within dharmasastra literature are people who orientate their actions toward the Veda and therefore their actions and decisions (ācāra) can be used as law.  According to {{IAST|smṛti}} literature, sadācāra are the source of correct living, dharma, and therefore Hindu law, when laws set forth in the Vedas and Traditional texts do not address a particular issue.&lt;ref name="Davis, Jr. Donald R. Chapter One"/&gt;  Several ancient commentators (including Kumārila) go so far as to put forth the claim that practices considered legitimate and recorded in the smṛtis but not found in the Vedas are actually located in a "lost Veda" available to the composers of the Dharma texts but now no longer extant.&lt;ref&gt;See Jonardon Ganeri's discussion of appeals to a "lost Veda" in "The ritual roots of moral reason: lessons from Mīmāṃsā", p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source of Dharma==
Many texts within the Hindu Law tradition refer to ācāra as the third source of dharma.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, Paul. pp. 2006. 485&lt;/ref&gt;  Although knowledge about dharma received from the Vedas remains the primary source, the Vedas rarely mention dharma in a practical application for daily living.  Because of this, there exist two other sources for dharma which provide more personally applicable directions for the follower’s lives.  If an answer to a question is not found within the Vedas themselves, the question is then posed to each level of sources until an answer is given.&lt;ref name="Davis, Jr. Donald R. Chapter One"/&gt;
 
In descending rank in hierarchy, the sources of dharma are:
#[[Vedas]] ([[śruti]])
#Traditional Texts ({{IAST|[[smṛti]]}})
#Customary Law (ācāra)

The power of ācāra within this hierarchy comes from its ability to connect with the Vedas.  This connection comes either through the sadācāra, or leader, who establishes the ācāra because of his knowledge of the Vedas, or through citing an additional text as a source that is itself connected with the Vedas.

==Textual Accounts==
There are a number of telling references to ''ācāra'' in Dharmaśāstra texts which reveal the real importance custom had for the settling of legal disputes.  [[Nāradasmṛti|Nārada]], for example, states that when something stated in a text on dharma conflicts with custom, custom wins out over the text.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Nārada'' Mātṛkā 1.34&lt;/ref&gt;  Asahāya, in his commentary to this statement, confirms that the texts should never overturn ''lokācāra'', or the "customs of the people."  ''[[Yājñavalkya Smṛti|Yājñavalkya]]'' 1.156 agrees that what is considered anathema by the people, even if proscribed by the smṛtis, is not to be enforced.  ''Manu'' 8.41 likewise states that a judge must study the specific laws practiced by castes (''jātidharma''), particular regions (''janapadharma''), and families (''kuladharma'') before making any legal pronouncements relating to them.

Even in rules concerning legal procedure itself, the importance of custom is evidenced.  ''Nārada'' 1.115 states that the validity of documents, i.e. whether they must be witnessed, written in one's own handwriting, etc., should be determined based on local conventions.

With regard to individual groups' own self-governance, ''Nārada'' 10.2-3 requires that the king allow [[heresy|heretical]] monastic groups (like [[Jain]]s and [[Buddhist]]s), [[guilds]], local councils, and other corporate groups to exercise their own laws and customs.&lt;ref&gt;
See also ''Bṛhaspati'' 2.29-31&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''Yājñavalkya'' 1.342-343, the king must preserve the customs and conventions of all newly conquered lands as well.

Various scholars hold differing ideas about the origin of the recorded ācāra found in Dharmaśāstra literature such as the {{IAST|[[Manusmṛti]]}}.  Some, such as scholar Richard Lariviere, hold that traditional {{IAST|smṛti}} texts are "records of actual customs and practices found in classical India".  These were factual records "recorded whether the compilers of {{IAST|smṛtis}} agreed with them or not".&lt;ref name="Lariviere, Richard W 1997. pp. 618"/&gt;  Although each of the customs recorded within {{IAST|smṛtis}} were drawn from various times and localities, the importance of recording and compiling them was to integrate the local practices into the larger brahminical sector by connecting them to the Vedas.

A different origin for the textual accounts of ācāra stated by scholar Donald R. Davis Jr., claims the ācāra of the time was not directly recorded verbatim, but instead influenced the scholars who crafted {{IAST|smṛti}} literature.  However, even without the direct approval or recording done by classically defined sadācāra, or Vedic scholars, the community norms of a particular location dictated by their own leaders, who may not be Vedic scholars, remained meaningful.&lt;ref name="Davis, Jr. Donald R. Chapter Seven"/&gt;  This demonstrates a view in which a particular practice doesn't have to be directly tied to the Veda in order for it to be honored as ācāra.

==Role of Ācāra in Hindu Law==
Various difficult questions arise in regard to the relative force of [[śruti]], {{IAST|smṛti}}, and ācāra in Hindu law and numerous rules have been laid down in cases of apparent and real conflicts among them.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, P.V. pp. 863&lt;/ref&gt; "Ācāra (customs and usage) are transcendental law, and so are the practices declared in the Veda and the {{IAST|smṛti}}; therefore a twice-born person desirous of his own welfare should always make effort to follow it."&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Manusmṛti}} 1.107&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of ācāra itself has changed over time in [[Hindu law]]. In the earliest days, ācāra that was to be followed was that observed or declared by learned Brahmins who were highly moral and selfless. Gradually, however, usage that had no visible secular purpose came to be looked upon as binding.  Eventually, even customary norms of Śudras became enforceable by the king.  In this manner, ācāra became the actual source of Hindu law in more contemporary times.  Commentaries on the śāstras indicate an attempt to reconcile the text law with the actual usages of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, P.V. pp. 876&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]] religion, '''Ītzpāpālōtl''' {{IPA-nah|iːt͡spaːˈpaːlot͡ɬ|}} ("Obsidian Butterfly") was a striking skeletal warrior [[goddess]] who ruled over the paradise world of [[Tamoanchan]], the paradise of victims of infant mortality and the place identified as where humans were created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azteccalendar.com/god/Itzpapalotl.html Itzpapalotl, the Obsidian or Clawed Butterfly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; She is the mother of [[Mixcoatl]] and is particularly associated with the [[moth]] ''[[Rothschildia orizaba]]'' from the family [[Saturniidae]]. Some of her associations are birds and fire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/od/aztecgodsgoddesses/p/Itzpapalotl.htm?terms=itzpapalotl Itzpapalotl: Itzpapalotl, Goddess of Fire and Birds in Aztec Religion, Mythology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605143439/http://atheism.about.com/od/aztecgodsgoddesses/p/Itzpapalotl.htm?terms=itzpapalotl |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she primarily appears in the form of the Obsidian Butterfly.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gingerich|first=Willard|date=1988|title=Three Nahuatl Hymns on the Mother Archetype: An Interpretive Commentary|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1051822|journal=Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos|volume=4|issue=2|pages=191–244|doi=10.2307/1051822}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rothschildia orizaba.JPG|thumb|''Rothschildia orizaba'', the moth genus and species with which the Itzpapalotl goddess is associated]]

==Iconography==
Itzpapalotl's name can either mean "obsidian butterfly" or "clawed butterfly"; the latter meaning seems most likely. It's quite possible that clawed butterfly refers to the bat and in some instances Itzpapalotl is depicted with bat wings. However, she can also appear with clear butterfly or eagle attributes. Her wings are obsidian or [[tecpatl]] (flint) knife tipped.&lt;ref name="Miller &amp; Taube, p. 100"&gt;Miller &amp; Taube, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; (In the ''Manuscript of 1558'', Itzpapalotl is described as having "blossomed into the white flint, and they took the white and wrapped it in a bundle.") She could appear in the form of a beautiful, seductive woman or terrible goddess with a skeletal head and butterfly wings supplied with stone blades. Although the identity remains inconclusive, the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] deity named Goddess 2J by Alfonso Caso and Ignacio Bernal may be a Classic Zapotec form of Itzpapalotl. In many instances Goddess 2J, whose image is found on ceramic urns, is identified with bats. "In folklore, bats are sometimes called "black butterflies"".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Benson : "The Maya and the Bat", p. 113. In :- ''Latin American Indian Literatures Journal'', vol 4 (1988). Citing :- Elsie Clews Parsons : ''Mitla''. U of Chicago Pr, 1936. p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; Itzpapalotl is sometimes represented as a goddess with flowing hair holding a trophy leg. The femur is thought by some scholars to have significance as a war trophy or a sacred object in Pre-Hispanic art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1UxGR6UB7AwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Cave, City, and Eagle's Nest: An Interpretive Journey Through the Mapa de Cuauhtinchan|last=Carrasco|first=David|last2=Sessions|first2=Scott|date=2007|publisher=UNM Press|year=|isbn=9780826342836|location=|pages=169-178|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ritual==
Itzpapalotl is the patron of the day and associated with the stars Cozcuauhtli and Trecena 1 House in the Aztec calendar. The Trecena 1 House is one of the five western trecena dates dedicated to the [[cihuateteo]], or women who had died in childbirth. Not only was Itzpapalotl considered one of the [[cihuateteo]] herself, but she was also one of the [[tzitzimime]], star demons that threatened to devour people during solar eclipses.&lt;ref name="Miller &amp; Taube, p. 100"/&gt;

One of the prominent aspects of the ritual surrounding Itzpapalotl relates to the creation story of the Aztec tribe, the [[Chichimeca|Chichimec]]. The ritual is illustrated in the sixteenth century document known as the Map of Cuauhtinchan No. 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the maw of the each monster: mesoAmerican ritual cave use|last=Brady, Prufer, eds.|first=James E., Keith M.|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2005|isbn=0292705867|location=Austin, TX|pages=69-87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An illustration from this document shows Chichimec warriors emerging out of a seven-chambered cave behind Itzpapalotl. The deity is shown brandishing a severed leg, thought to be a symbol of battle. Beginning in the 1990s, archeologists exploring the  Barranca Del Aguila region, southwest of Mexico City, have discovered caves carved to simulate the seven chambered cave, known as [[Chicomoztoc]], from the ritual creation narrative. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gidwitz|first=Tom|date=March–April 2009|title=Map Quest: Follow a pre-Hispanic manuscript into the world of the Chichimecs|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/42478927/Map_Quest.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1539553496&amp;Signature=oOivePbg7EPfeHlaGQ1OJBb6eaw%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DMap_Quest.pdf|journal=Archeology|volume=|pages=26-29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
According to the ''Manuscript of 1558'', section VII, Itzpapalotl was one of two divine 2-headed doe-deers (the other one being [[Chimalman]]) who temporarily transformed themselves into women in order to seduce men. Itzpapalotl approached the two "cloud serpents named Xiuhnel {{IPA-nah|ˈʃiwnel|}} and Mimich {{IPA-nah|ˈmimit͡ʃ|}}", who transformed themselves into men (so as to disguise themselves when all the others of the [[Centzonmimixcoa]] had been slain in the ambush?).  To Xiuhnel, Itzpapalotl said ""Drink, Xiuhnel." Xiuhnel drank the blood and then immediately lay down with her. Suddenly she ... devoured him, tore open his breast. ...  Then Mimich ... ran and ... descended into a thorny barrel cactus, fell into it, and the woman fell down after him."&lt;ref&gt;Miguel León-Portilla &amp; Earl Shorris : ''In the Language of Kings''. Norton &amp; Co., NY, 2001. p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In the myth-history narrative of the Annales de Cuauhtitlan, the cloud deity victims take the form of deer, the hearts of whom are eaten by Itzpapalotl. The theme of the heart devouring goddess appears in other global mythologies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
