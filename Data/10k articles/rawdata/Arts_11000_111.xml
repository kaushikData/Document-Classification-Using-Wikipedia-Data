{{Merge|On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|date=April 2018}}
'''''Adversus haereses''''' ('''''Against Heresies''''') is the name of a five-volume (the initial plan includes only two volumes) work against [[Gnosticism]] (and other [[Christian heresies]]), written about AD 180 by the [[Church Father]] [[Irenaeus]], Bishop of Lyon in Gaul (now France). The work is also known as ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis]]''.

It is sometimes confused with:

*''[[Panarion]]'' (medicine-chest), also a work in opposition to heresies, written in the 4th century by [[Epiphanius of Salamis]].
*''Adversus omnes haereses,'' an appendix to the work ''De praescriptionem haereticorum'' by [[Tertullian]], who lived c. 160–c. 225. Most scholars, however, believe that the appendix is not by Tertullian but was added later; it is therefore attributed to a [[Pseudo-Tertullian]].

The '''Ain Sakhri Lovers''' figurine is a sculpture that was found in one of the [[Ain Sakhri]] caves near [[Bethlehem]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110811115432/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/p/phallic_figurine.aspx|title=British Museum - Ain Sakhri lovers figurine|date=2011-08-11|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture is considered to be 11,000 years old and to be the oldest known representation of two people engaged in sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name=ahotw&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/vNEwNR8rSzGPSwSn3yeJwA A History of the World -7], BBC.co.uk, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The sculpture was identified in 1933 by {{ill|René Neuville|fr||de|}}, a French [[Consulate#Consulates and embassies|consul]] in [[Jerusalem]]&lt;ref&gt;Neuville represented the French Republic as vice-consul at Jerusalem from 1928 to 1937 and as consul-general from 1946 to 1952; see [https://books.google.com/books?id=easK2KFwWssC&amp;lpg=PA301&amp;ots=FUqickvmd0&amp;dq=Ren%C3%A9%20Neuville&amp;pg=PA301#v=onepage&amp;q=Ren%C3%A9%20Neuville&amp;f=false footnote on page 301 of ''Les Mandats Francais Et Anglais Dans Une Perspective'' (in French)]; he is known for his work with [[Skhul and Qafzeh hominids]] in the [[Levant]].&lt;/ref&gt; and prehistorian, when looking through random finds obtained by the French Fathers at [[Bethlehem]]. He found the stone whilst visiting a small museum with [[Henri Breuil|Abbé Breuil]].&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; Neuville immediately identified it as important and was able to get an introduction to the [[Bedouin]] who had made the finds at Wadi Khareitoun. He was led to a location within the [[Ain Sakhri]] caves and it is from these caves that the sculpture gets its name. Excavations of the caves revealed that the cave had been used domestically thousands of years ago and the finds were [[Natufian]]. For this reason it is thought that the figurine was used domestically and had not been left there as part of a funeral.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The person who made the sculpture came from the [[Natufians]], an early [[Epipaleolithic]] culture whose members are thought to be the first humans to gather grass seeds that remained attached to their stems.&lt;ref name=ahotw/&gt; This is an important step in agriculture as it eventually allowed farmers to choose which seeds to eat and which to keep to sow the following season.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; These people hunted gazelle and are the first known to domesticate dogs,&lt;ref name="Clutton-Brock1995"&gt;{{Citation |title=The domestic dog: its evolution, behaviour and interactions with people |last=Clutton-Brock |first=Juliet |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=Serpell, James |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-41529-2 |pages= |chapter=Origins of the dog: domestication and early history }}&lt;/ref&gt; sheep, and goats which also involves [[selective breeding]]. It has been speculated that the stability of having a managed food programme allowed the Natufians to create large communities of two to three hundred people and to create [[art]].&lt;ref name=trans&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b00q2p68 A History of the World in 100 objects - Part 7], BBC Radio 4, 26 January 2010, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/transcripts/episode7/ transcript], accessed 23 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
The sculpture was made by carving a single "[[calcite]] cobble" which was picked away with a stone point to identify the position of the couple.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although it lacks details, such as faces, it is considered to be a clever piece of sculpture. Artist [[Marc Quinn]] has noted that the figure looks different depending on the viewer's perspective, and may resemble a couple, a penis, breasts, or a vagina depending on this perspective,&lt;ref name=ahotw/&gt; or two testicles when viewed upside-down, from the bottom. Quinn compared it to a modern pornographic film where the action may include close-ups and long shots. It is clear that the figures in the couple are facing each other, but the gender of the figures can only be presumed.&lt;ref name=bmdb/&gt;

==Importance and purchase==
After the death of René Neuville in 1952, it was purchased by the [[British Museum]] at Sotheby's in 1958 from M. Y. Neuville.&lt;ref name=bmdb&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=1358965&amp;partid=1 figurine], British Museum, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The object formed the basis of an episode of ''[[A History of the World in 100 Objects]]'', a BBC radio programme in January 2010 about the dawn of agriculture.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

==Creation==
The mural was commissioned in 1929 by [[Alvin Saunders Johnson]], director of [[The New School for Social Research]] in New York City, for the school's boardroom. Benton was not offered any payment beyond material costs. Instead, he saw the work as an opportunity to make a name for himself and thereby get more commissions in the future. The subjects were based on Benton's extensive travels in the United States. Benton said about the work: "Every detail of every picture is a thing I myself have seen and known. Every head is a real person drawn from life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Theroux|first=Paul|date=December 2014|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/story-behind-thomas-hart-bentons-incredible-masterwork-1-180953405/|title=The Story Behind Thomas Hart Benton's Incredible Masterwork|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|accessdate=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mural was painted with egg [[tempera]] on linen canvases.&lt;ref name="met1" /&gt;

==Provenance==
The mural was acquired by [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company]] in 1984. After two years of renovation it was installed at AXA's headquarters at [[AXA Equitable Center|787 Seventh Avenue]] in New York City. In 1996 AXA moved to 1290 Avenue of the Americas and installed the mural in the building's lobby. In January 2012 the mural was renovated again, and in December 2012 it was donated to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bent/hd_bent.htm|title=Thomas Hart Benton's ''America Today'' Mural|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andachtsbilder''' (singular '''Andachtsbild''', [[German language|German]] for '''devotional image''') is a German term often used in English in [[art history]] for [[Christianity|Christian]] devotional images designed as aids for [[prayer]] or [[contemplation]].  The images "generally show holy figures extracted from a narrative context to form a highly focused, and often very emotionally powerful, vignette".&lt;ref&gt;Ross, 12&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is especially used of Northern [[Gothic art]] around the 14th and 15th centuries, when new subjects such as the ''[[Pietà]]'', ''[[Pensive Christ]]'', ''[[Man of Sorrows]]'', ''[[Arma Christi]]'', ''[[Veil of Veronica]]'', the severed head of [[John the Baptist]], and the ''[[Virgin of Sorrows]]'' became extremely popular.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder and, much more fully, Schiller cover these ''passim'', see their indexes. Schiller's translator always translates the German term to "devotional images" etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was first devised for a group of mainly [[sculpture|sculptural]] subjects, including the ''Pietà'' and ''Pensive Christ'', that were thought to have emerged in [[convent]]s in south-western Germany in the 14th century, although their history is now believed to be more complicated.&lt;ref name="Hamburger, 3"&gt;Hamburger, 3&lt;/ref&gt;  In churches such images were often given a [[side-chapel]], and sometimes are given special places in the rituals of [[Holy Week]].  For example, [[Sacramental bread|consecrated hosts]] might be stored in the cavity of the [[Holy Wounds|spear wound]] in a sculpted ''Pietà'' between [[Good Friday]] and [[Easter Sunday]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 180–181&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional subjects from the narrative of the [[Passion of Christ]] such as the ''[[Ecce Homo]]'' and the ''[[Crucifixion of Jesus]]'' were also treated in the same way.  Though the ''[[Crucifix]]'' had been treated as an intense, isolated image for centuries, at least as far back as the 10th century ''[[Gero Cross]]'' in [[Cologne]], many images showed a new emphasis on graphically depicted streaming blood, wounds and contorted poses.  This process started around 1300, so the influence appears to be from the ''Crucifixion'' to other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 146–148&lt;/ref&gt;  The traditional ''Ecce Homo'' is a very crowded scene, in which the figure of Christ is often less prominent than those of his captors, but in the andachtsbilder versions the other figures and complex architectural background have vanished, leaving only Christ, with a plain background in most painted versions (see the example by [[Antonello da Messina]] in the gallery below).&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 75–76.  There are other small types with just two or three figures - see the Mantegna in the gallery.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PietaKrivakova.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Early [[Bohemia]]n [[Pietà]] of 1390–1400]]
Andachtsbilder have a strong emphasis on the [[grief]] and suffering of Christ and the figures close to him.  Their use was encouraged by movements such as the [[Franciscan]]s, the [[Devotio Moderna]] and [[German mysticism]] in [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval Europe]], which promoted meditation on the sufferings of Christ by intense mental visualization ("imitation") of them and their physical effects.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 179–180, 190–191, 197–198&lt;/ref&gt;  The most extreme, even gruesome, examples often came from the eastern edge of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and beyond in Poland, [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] and the [[Baltic states]], where large carved [[wikt:gobbet|gobbets]] of congealed blood can cover the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnw.art.pl/index.php/en/collections/pemanent_galleries/the_gallery_of_medieval_art/ Examples] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727210620/http://www.mnw.art.pl/index.php/en/collections/pemanent_galleries/the_gallery_of_medieval_art/ |date=July 27, 2011 }} from the [[National Museum, Warsaw]]&lt;/ref&gt;   But the style spread all over Europe, including Italy, although the extremes of emotionalism were avoided there until the [[Baroque]].

The term is often used specifically for small works intended for personal contemplation in the home.  By the 15th century the emerging urban [[middle class]]es of Northern Europe were increasingly able to afford small paintings or carvings.  The depiction was often very "close-up", with a half-length figure occupying nearly the whole picture space.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, pp. 154–161&lt;/ref&gt;   Andachtsbilder subjects were also very common in [[old master print|prints]].  However larger works for churches or outdoor display are also covered by the term.  By the mid-15th century andachtsbilder were influencing large monumental works, a process James Snyder discusses in relation to major works such as [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''[[Deposition (Rogier van der Weyden)|Prado Deposition]]'', the ''[[Isenheim Altarpiece]]'' of [[Matthias Grünewald]] and the carved ''Altarpiece of the Holy Blood'' by [[Tilman Riemenschneider]] at [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, pp. 128, 348-50, 306 respectively&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Mass of St Gregory]]'', which included a vision of the ''Man of Sorrows'', was a composition often used on [[altarpiece]]s which took a common andachtsbilder subject and expanded it into a subject suitable for more monumental works.

The art historian [[Jeffrey F. Hamburger]] observed that the term has now "lost whatever precision it could ever lay claim to, having been applied to virtually any object that might have been used to stimulate devotional experience".&lt;ref name="Hamburger, 3" /&gt;  Although works in the andachtsbilder tradition remained very popular in [[Art in Roman Catholicism|Catholic art]] for centuries, for example in [[Spanish Baroque art|Baroque Spain]] [[Italian Baroque|and Italy]], the term is less likely to be applied to much later images.  The English term "devotional image" or "picture" etc. can apply to a wide range of images, in all media, included modern commercially printed reproductions or [[prayer card]]s, especially those featuring a portrait-like image rather than a narrative scene.

[[Image:Apollon de Mantoue Louvre MA689.jpg|thumb|220px|Detail of the ''Apollon de Mantoue'' ([[Louvre Museum]])]] 
The '''Apollo of Mantua''' and its variants are early forms of the [[Apollo Citharoedus]] statue type, in which the god holds the [[cithara]] in his left arm.  The type-piece, the first example discovered, is named for its location at Mantua; the type is represented by [[neo-Attic]] Imperial Roman copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century, modelled upon a supposed Greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 5th century BCE, in a style similar to works of [[Polykleitos|Polyclitus]] but more archaic.  The Apollo held the ''cythara''  against his extended left arm, of which in the Louvre example (''illustration'') a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps. 

More than a dozen other replicas of the type have been found, the principal ones being those conserved in the national museums of [[Naples]] and of [[Mantua]].

The lost original would have been bronze. The name of the teacher of [[Phidias]], [[Hegias of Athens]] is sometimes invoked, but there are no surviving examples of Hegias' work to judge from.

Examples include:

:The Naples ''Apollo of Mantua'', a bronze found at [[Pompeii]], in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Archeologico Nazionale]], Naples (inv. 5630).

:The Louvre ''Apollo of Mantua'', formerly in the [[Bibliothèque Mazarine]], entered the museum in 1871.

:The [[Fogg Art Museum]] ''Apollo of Mantua'', a Roman bronze&lt;ref&gt;Spectroscopy revealed the alloy in fact to be [[brass]] (Congdon 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; head of the ''Apollo of Mantua'' type, originally about one-third lifesize.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4445">'''Art competitions''' were held as part of the '''[[1912 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].  It was the first time that art competitions were part of the Olympic program.  Medals were awarded in five categories ([[architecture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[painting]], and [[sculpture]]), for works inspired by sport-related themes.

[[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|Art competitions]] were part of the Olympic program from 1912 to 1948, but were discontinued due to concerns about amateurism and professionalism.  Since 1952, a non-competitive art and cultural festival has been associated with each Games.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2022">The phrase '''Art In Bloom''' is often used as the title of various exhibits held annually, usually in spring, in [[art museum]]s. The phrase was created by a Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, volunteer, Lorraine M. Pitts who also helped found the Danforth Museum in Framingham, MA. The exhibit is composed of traditional [[visual art]] pieces and corresponding [[floral design|flower arrangements]] done by local professional [[florists]] and [[gardens|garden club]] members. 

The original exhibit was held in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Boston]] in 1976, where it is held annually; other institutions hosting such displays include the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]], the [[Art Gallery of Greater Victoria]], the [[North Carolina Museum of Art]], and the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Universities such as the [[University of Missouri]]'s Museum of Art and Archaeology in [[Columbia, Missouri]] also hold "Art in Bloom" exhibitions.

[[File:Blessed Be the Host of the King of Heaven… - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|400px|''Ecclesia militans'', one of the largest icons in existence]]
'''''Blessed Be the Host of the Heavenly Tsar''''' (Благословенно воинство Небесного Царя), also known as the '''''[[Church militant and church triumphant|Ecclesia militans]]''''' ("The Church Militant"), is a grand [[Russian Orthodox]] [[icon (religion)|icon]] commemorating the [[conquest of Kazan]] by [[Ivan IV of Russia]] (1552). 

Measuring almost four meters in width, ''Ecclesia militans'' is one of the largest icons ever produced in medieval [[Russia]]. It has been attributed to Ivan's confessor Andrew (later known as [[Athanasius, Metropolitan of Moscow]]).

The icon shows Ivan the Terrible as he follows the [[Archangel Michael]] in leading the triumphant Russian troops away from the conquered city in flames (symbolising both [[Kazan]]' and [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]). In the top left corner of the icon the Mother of God with the infant Jesus is shown seated outside the heavenly gate of [[Jerusalem]] (symbolising the city of [[Moscow]]) and distributing crowns to messenger angels who proceed to reward the martyrs of Ivan's army.

This unusually sophisticated iconography has generated a plethora of interpretations. It is often assumed that the Tsar is followed by his ancestors such as [[Dmitry Donskoy]] and other [[Grand Prince of Vladimir|Grand Princes of Vladimir]]. This interpretation is based on ''[[The Tale of the Princes of Vladimir]]'', an early 16th-century treatise highlighting Ivan's illustrious and ancient pedigree. The icon was displayed next to the royal seat in the [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Dormition Cathedral]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]] (the main church of the [[Tsardom of Russia]]).

The original icon from the 1550s is now on display in the [[Tretyakov Gallery]]. A smaller 16th-century copy, formerly set on the tomb of [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich]] in the [[Chudov Monastery]], has been preserved in the Moscow Kremlin museum.

'''''Catfish in Black Bean Sauce''''' is a 1999 [[comedy-drama]] film about a [[Vietnam]]ese brother and sister raised by an [[African American]] couple. The film stars [[Chi Muoi Lo]], [[Paul Winfield]], [[Sanaa Lathan]], and [[Mary Alice]].

==Plot==
Dwayne, Dolores and Harold play a game of cards with Dolores trying to convince Dwayne to take a cat Harold found on the way home. Dwayne thinks there is something wrong with the cat and refuses. One afternoon, Dwayne is in his living room with his girlfriend Nina and excuses himself. He grabs a small red box, a rose and some champagne. When he returns to the living room, however, he finds his roommate, Michael and his new [[transgender]] girlfriend waiting there. He puts the ring away as he and Nina head to Dwayne's parents' house for a barbecue.

On the way over, Dwayne fails to stop for a stop sign and is pulled over by a cop who asks him to step out of the car. He spots the ring and tells Dwayne that Nina is out of his league and to enjoy it while it lasts, which makes Dwayne question the relationship.  At the barbecue, Dwayne proposes to Nina offhandedly. She says yes just as Mai walks in. Mai lets the family know she has located their birth mother, Thanh, and she is flying her to Los Angeles. Dolores takes the news hard and worries she'll be replaced, Harold is optimistic and Dwayne pretends to be indifferent.

There is a brief flashback to when Mai was young and she yells at Dolores saying "you're not my mother" and runs to hug Harold. At the airport, Mai cries when she sees her mother, while Dwayne has no reaction. They sit down for a family dinner and  Dolores feels like she is being replaced. As everyone leaves, Thanh demands to go with Dwayne/Sap despite the preparations Mai has made at her house.

Thanh worries about Dwayne and does not think Nina is the right girl for him and tells Mai. Nina goes to Mai's for lunch, during which Mai tells her that she ought to be more affectionate with Dwayne, but Nina feels she has been affectionate enough. Harold's birthday arrives and no one shows up for the party. Dolores has a fit and blames it on Thanh's arrival. Harold gets frustrated and has a heart attack. Mai rushes to the hospital to meet Dolores, where they have a fight. When the doctor says that Harold will be okay, Dolores tries to apologize, but Mai leaves telling her to spend time with Harold.

The next day, Dwayne calls to Dolores and she is upset that he was not there. Wanting to be more affectionate, Nina prepares a big dinner for the two of them. Dwayne arrives and suggests they break up. Finally, there is an all out war with everyone: Thanh and Dolores, Nina and Dwayne, Samantha and Michael ending when Michael's girlfriend lifts Dolores and Thanh in the air to separate them.

The next day, Mai comes over to help with Harold's food. Dolores says she does not need help, but Mai goes in to hug her. Mai realizes that Dolores has been more of a mother and treated her far better than Thanh.  Over a game of [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]], Dwayne, Mai, Dolores and Harold discuss that Dwayne has broken up with Nina. Everyone thinks he is stupid because she loves him. Mai says that Nina has accepted a job in New York City. Dwayne realizes he made a mistake and everyone finally gets along. The movie ends with a big family dinner with Dolores and Thanh nodding in understanding and playing Monopoly.

==Reviews==
The film has received mixed reviews. A ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' review noted that as the film’s writer/director/actor Chi Muoi Lo "spread himself too thin, resulting in an uneven picture but one that has plenty of substance and emotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fandango.com/catfishinblackbeansauce_241/criticreviews|title=''Catfish in Black Bean Sauce''|publisher=fandango.com|accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film was "a first draft for a movie that could have been extraordinary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000728/REVIEWS/7280301/1023|title=Catfish In Black Bean Sauce |last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=2000-07-28|publisher=''The Chicago Sun-Times''|accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' noted that the film was "a comedy of interracial wariness and misunderstanding marked by a refreshing lack of sappiness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/catfishinblackbeansauce ''Catfish in Black Bean Sauce'' at metacritic]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Covering cherub''' (in literary usage) is the [[Anxiety of influence|obstructing presence]] for the artist of the inherited tradition, and cultural predecessors, with which they are faced.

==Origins==
Found originally in [[Ezekiel]], the covering cherub was adapted for use by (among others) both [[John Milton|Milton]] and [[William Blake]].  In the [[William Blake's mythology|Blakean vision]], the covering cherub was a composite but always negative figure of truth's guardian turned destructive,&lt;ref&gt;D. Erdman, ''The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake'' (2008) p. 944 and p. 926&lt;/ref&gt; of a cruel and hardened Selfhood;&lt;ref&gt;N.Marsh, ''William Blake: The Poems'' (2012) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; and it was from Blake that in 1967 [[Harold Bloom]] derived his concept of the covering cherub as a literary/cultural barrier.  Apparently, a waking nightmare he experienced gave rise first to his poem on the subject, "The Covering Cherub", and eventually to his book [[Anxiety of Influence|''The Anxiety of Influence'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hilobrow.com/2013/07/11/harold-bloom/ Harold Bloom]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thematics==
For Bloom, "the Covering Cherub then is a demon of continuity...cultural history, the dead poets, the embarrassments  of a tradition grown too wealthy to need anything more".&lt;ref&gt;H. Bloom, ''The Anxiety of Influence'' (1973) p. 39 and p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Bloom considered the artistic struggle in [[Freud]]ian terms, as a filial contest with a [[father figure]] carrying cultural authority&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers ed., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; – an [[Oedipal conflict]] with a [[superego]] either originally modelled on a cultural hero&lt;ref&gt;L. Hudson/B. Jarot, ''The Way Men Think'' (1993) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; or influenced subsequently by such an ideal model.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Though initially referencing a patriarchal father/son interaction, the concept of the covering cherub has also been applied to works by women writers such as [[Angela Carter]]&lt;ref&gt;''Bluebeard Gothic'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Virginia Woolf]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Keane, ''John Milton's Paradise Lost'' (2013) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics have seen Bloom's central image as too open-ended to serve as analyical tool, a vague series of analogies only tenuously working as Bloom desired.&lt;ref&gt;J. Doane, ''Nostalgia and Sexual Difference'' (2013) p. 90-1&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Hermann–Mauguin notation */  Swapped monoclinic and orthorhombic table rows, so that the families would be in order of decreasing symmetry</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12193">In [[crystallography]], a '''crystallographic point group''' is a set of [[symmetry operation]]s, like rotations or reflections, that leave a central point fixed while moving other directions and faces of the [[crystal]] to the positions of features of the same kind. For a periodic crystal (as opposed to a [[quasicrystal]]), the group must also be consistent with maintenance of the three-dimensional [[translational symmetry]] that defines crystallinity. The macroscopic properties of a crystal would look exactly the same before and after any of the operations in its point group. In the classification of crystals, each point group is also known as a '''crystal class'''.

There are infinitely many three-dimensional point groups. However, the [[crystallographic restriction theorem|crystallographic restriction]] of the infinite families of general [[point group]]s results in there being only 32 crystallographic point groups. These 32 point groups are one-and-the same as the 32 types of morphological (external) crystalline symmetries derived in 1830 by [[Johann F. C. Hessel|Johann Friedrich Christian Hessel]] from a consideration of observed crystal forms. 

The point group of a crystal, among other things, determines directional variation of the physical properties that arise from its structure, including [[crystal optics|optical properties]] such as whether it is [[birefringence|birefringent]], or whether it shows the [[Pockels effect]].

==Notation==

The point groups are denoted by their component symmetries. There are a few standard notations used by crystallographers, [[mineralogist]]s, and [[physicists]].

For the correspondence of the two systems below, see '''[[crystal system]]'''.

===Schoenflies notation===
{{main|Schoenflies notation}}
{{details|Point groups in three dimensions}}

In [[Arthur Moritz Schoenflies|Schoenflies]] notation, point groups are denoted by a letter symbol with a subscript. The symbols used in crystallography mean the following:

*''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for [[cyclic group|cyclic]]) indicates that the group has an ''n''-fold rotation axis. ''C&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the addition of a mirror (reflection) plane perpendicular to the [[axis of rotation]]. ''C&lt;sub&gt;nv&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the addition of n mirror planes parallel to the axis of rotation.
*''S&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for ''Spiegel'', German for [[mirror]]) denotes a group that contains only a ''2n''-fold [[Improper rotation|rotation-reflection axis]].
*''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for [[dihedral group|dihedral]], or two-sided) indicates that the group has an ''n''-fold rotation axis plus ''n'' twofold axes perpendicular to that axis. ''D&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' has, in addition, a mirror plane perpendicular to the ''n''-fold axis. ''D&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt;'' has, in addition to the elements of ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', mirror planes parallel to the ''n''-fold axis.
*The letter ''T'' (for [[tetrahedron]]) indicates that the group has the symmetry of a tetrahedron. ''T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' includes improper rotation operations, ''T'' excludes improper rotation operations, and ''T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''T'' with the addition of an inversion.
*The letter ''O'' (for [[octahedron]]) indicates that the group has the symmetry of an octahedron (or [[cube]]), with (''O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'') or without (''O'') improper operations (those that change handedness).

Due to the [[crystallographic restriction theorem]], ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 in 2- or 3-dimensional space.

''D&lt;sub&gt;4d&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''D&lt;sub&gt;6d&lt;/sub&gt;'' are actually forbidden because they contain [[improper rotation]]s with n=8 and 12 respectively. The 27 point groups in the table plus ''T'', ''T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''O'' and ''O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' constitute 32 crystallographic point groups.

'''Dance''' is a [[performing art]] [[art form|form]] consisting of purposefully selected sequences of [[kinesiology|human movement]]. This movement has [[aesthetic]] and [[symbolism (arts)|symbolic]] value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular [[culture]].{{refn|group=nb|Many definitions of dance have been proposed. This definition is based on the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"Dance is human movement created and expressed for an aesthetic purpose."&lt;ref name="Fraleigh1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sondra Horton Fraleigh|title=Dance and the Lived Body: A Descriptive Aesthetics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K4FN1lOcR-wC&amp;pg=PA43|year=1987|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre|isbn=978-0822971702|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"Dance is a transient mode of expression performed in a given form and style by the human body moving in space. Dance occurs through purposefully selected and controlled rhythmic movements; the resulting phenomenon is recognized as dance both by the performer and the observing members of a given group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joann Kealinohomoku|editor1-last=Copeland|editor1-first=Roger|editor2-last=Cohen|editor2-first=Marshall|title=An Anthropologist Looks at Ballet as a Form of Ethnic Dance|work=What is Dance?

"Dance is human behaviour composed (from the dancer’s perspective, which is usually shared by the audience members of the dancer’s culture) of purposeful (individual choice and social learning play a role), intentionally rhythmical, and culturally patterned sequences of nonverbal body movement mostly other than those performed in ordinary motor activities. The motion (in time, space, and with effort) has an inherent and aesthetic value (the notion of appropriateness and competency as viewed by the dancer’s culture) and symbolic potential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Judith Lynne Hanna|title=The performer-audience connection: emotion to metaphor in dance and society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ze8TAQAAIAAJ|year=1983|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0292764781}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Dance can be categorized and described by its [[choreography]], by its repertoire of movements, or by its [[History of dance|historical period]] or [[List of ethnic, regional, and folk dances by origin|place of origin]].

An important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of [[Concert dance|theatrical]] and [[Participation dance|participatory]] dance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsalive.ca/en/dan/dance101/forms.asp Canadian National Arts Centre – Dance Forms: An Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; although these two categories are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether [[Social dance|social]], [[ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], [[competitive dance|competitive]], [[erotic dance|erotic]], [[war dance|martial]], or [[sacred dance|sacred]]/[[liturgical dance|liturgical]]. Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including [[martial arts]], [[gymnastics]], [[cheerleading]], [[figure skating]], [[synchronized swimming]], marching bands, and many other forms of athletics.

==Performance and participation==
[[File:GDC onlywayaround.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Members of an American jazz dance company perform a formal group routine in a concert dance setting]]

Theatrical dance, also called performance or concert dance, is intended primarily as a spectacle, usually a [[performance]] upon a [[Stage (theater)|stage]] by [[virtuoso]] dancers. It often tells a [[narrative|story]], perhaps using [[Mime artist|mime]], [[Dance costumes|costume]] and [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]], or else it may simply [[Interpretive dance|interpret the musical accompaniment]], which is often specially composed. Examples are western [[ballet]] and [[modern dance]], [[Classical Indian dance]] and Chinese and Japanese song and dance dramas. Most classical forms are centred upon dance alone, but performance dance may also appear in [[opera]] and other forms of [[musical theatre]].

Participatory dance, on the other hand, whether it be a [[folk dance]], a [[social dance]], a [[group dance]] such as a [[Line dance|line]], [[Circle dance|circle]], [[Medieval dance#Other Chain Dances|chain]] or [[square dance]], or a [[partner dance]] such as is common in western [[Ballroom dance|Western ballroom dancing]], is undertaken primarily for a common purpose, such as [[social interaction]] or [[exercise]], of participants rather than onlookers. Such dance seldom has any narrative. A group dance and a ''[[corps de ballet]]'', a social partner dance and a ''[[pas de deux]]'', differ profoundly. Even a [[solo dance]] may be undertaken solely for the satisfaction of the dancer. Participatory dancers often all employ the same movements and steps but, for example, in the [[rave culture]] of [[electronic dance music]], vast crowds may engage in [[free dance]], uncoordinated with those around them. On the other hand, some cultures lay down strict rules as to the particular dances in which, for example, men, women and children may or must participate.

==Origins==
[[File:Dancing painting at Bhimbetka.jpg|thumb|left|Mesolithic dancers at Bhimbetka]]

[[archeology|Archeological]] evidence for early dance includes 9,000-year-old paintings in [[India]] at the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tomb paintings depicting dancing figures, dated c. 3300 BC. It has been proposed that before the invention of written languages, dance was an important part of the oral and performance methods of passing stories down from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="lecomte"&gt;Nathalie Comte. "Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World". Ed. Jonathan Dewald. Vol. 2. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2004. pp&amp;nbsp;94–108.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of dance in [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] [[altered state of consciousness|trance states]] and healing rituals (as observed today in many contemporary "primitive" cultures, from the Brazilian [[rainforest]] to the [[Kalahari Desert]]) is thought to have been another early factor in the social development of dance.&lt;ref name="guenther"&gt;Guenther, Mathias Georg.

References to dance can be found in very early recorded history; [[Greek dance]] (''[[horos]]'') is referred to by [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Lucian]].&lt;ref&gt;Raftis, Alkis, ''The World of Greek Dance'' Finedawn, Athens (1987) p25.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bible]] and [[Talmud]] refer to many events related to dance, and contain over 30 different dance terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kadman|first=Gurit|date=1952|title=Yemenite Dances and Their Influence on the New Israeli Folk Dances|jstor=835838|journal=Journal of the International Folk Music Council|volume=4|pages=27–30|doi=10.2307/835838}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[History of Chinese classical dance|Chinese]] pottery as early as the [[Neolithic]] period, groups of people are depicted dancing in a line holding hands,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.chnmuseum.cn/Default.aspx?TabId=549&amp;AntiqueLanguageID=3002|title=Basin with design of dancers|publisher=National Museum of China|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-23}} Pottery from the [[Majiayao culture]] (3100 BC to 2700 BC)&lt;/ref&gt; and the earliest Chinese word for "dance" is found written in the [[oracle bones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The history of Chinese dance|last=Kʻo-fen|first=Wang|date=1985|publisher=Foreign Languages Press|isbn=9780835111867|oclc=977028549|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dance is further described in the ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]''.&lt;ref name="aesthetic tradition"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d1eZuB2xwYwC&amp;pg=PA5|title=The Chinese aesthetic tradition|first=Zehou|last=Li|first2=Maija Bell|last2=Samei|date=2010|publisher=University of Hawaiʻi Press|isbn=9780824833077|oclc=960030161|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&amp;id=23281|title=Lü Shi Chun Qiu|last=Sturgeon|first=Donald|website=Chinese Text Project Dictionary|language=cn|access-date=2017-05-23|quote=Original text: 昔葛天氏之樂，三人操牛尾，投足以歌八闋}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primitive dance in ancient China was associated with sorcery and shamanic rituals.

During the first millennium [[common era|BCE]] in India, many texts were composed which attempted to codify aspects of daily life. [[Bharata Muni]]'s ''[[Natyashastra]]'' (literally ''"the text of dramaturgy"'') is one of the earlier texts. It mainly deals with drama, in which dance plays an important part in Indian culture. It categorizes dance into four types – secular, ritual, abstract, and, interpretive – and into four regional varieties. The text elaborates various hand-gestures (''[[mudras]]'') and classifies movements of the various limbs, steps and so on. A strong continuous tradition of dance has since continued in India, through to modern times, where it continues to play a role in culture, ritual, and, notably, the [[Bollywood]] entertainment industry. Many other contemporary dance forms can likewise be traced back to [[Historical dance|historical]], [[Traditional dance|traditional]], [[Ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], and [[List of dances sorted by ethnicity|ethnic]] dance.

==Dance and music==
{{main|Dance music}}
[[File:Dancing girls in concert.jpg|thumb|right|Dancing girls in pop-concert, Sofia, Bulgaria.]]
Dance is generally, though not exclusively, performed with the accompaniment of music and may or may not be performed ''in [[time signature|time]]'' to such music. Some dance (such as [[tap dance]]) may provide its own audible accompaniment in place of (or in addition to) music. Many early forms of music and dance were created for each other and are frequently performed together. Notable examples of traditional dance/music couplings include the [[jig]], [[waltz]], [[Tango music|tango]], [[disco]], and [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]]. Some [[musical genre]]s have a parallel dance form such as [[baroque music]] and [[baroque dance]]; other varieties of dance and music may share nomenclature but developed separately, such as [[Classical music era|classical music]] and [[classical ballet]].

== Dance and rhythm ==
'''[[Rhythm]] and dance''' are deeply linked in history and practice. The American dancer [[Ted Shawn]] wrote; "The conception of rhythm which underlies all studies of the dance is something about which we could talk forever, and still not finish."&lt;ref name="Shawn 50"&gt;Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; A musical rhythm requires two main elements; first, a regularly-repeating [[pulse (music)|pulse]] (also called the "beat" or "tactus") that establishes the [[tempo]] and, second, a pattern of [[Accent (music)|accents]] and [[Rest (music)|rests]] that establishes the character of the [[Meter (music)|metre or basic rhythmic pattern]]. The basic pulse is roughly equal in duration to a simple step or gesture.
[[File:Tango rhythm.svg|thumb|A basic tango rhythm]]
Dances generally have a characteristic tempo and rhythmic pattern. The tango, for example, is usually danced in {{music|time|2|4}} time at approximately 66 beats per minute. The basic slow step, called a "slow", lasts for one beat, so that a full "right–left" step is equal to one {{music|time|2|4}} measure. The basic forward and backward walk of the dance is so counted – "slow-slow" – while many additional figures are counted "slow – quick-quick.&lt;ref&gt;Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, ''Ballroom Dancing'', Teach Yourself Books, Hodder and Stoughton, 1977, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as musical rhythms are defined by a pattern of strong and weak beats, so repetitive body movements often depends on alternating "strong" and "weak" muscular movements.&lt;ref name="Kirstein 4"&gt;Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Given this alternation of left-right, of forward-backward and rise-fall, along with the [[Symmetry in biology|bilateral symmetry]] of the human body, it is natural that many dances and much music are in [[duple and quadruple meter]]. However, since some such movements require more time in one phase than the other – such as the longer time required to lift a hammer than to strike – some dance rhythms fall equally naturally into [[triple metre]].&lt;ref&gt;Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, as in [[Music of Southeastern Europe|the folk dances of the Balkans]], dance traditions depend heavily on more complex rhythms. Further, complex dances composed of a fixed sequence of steps always require phrases and melodies of a certain fixed length to accompany that sequence.

[[File:Lululaund - The Dancing Girl (painting and silk cloth. A.L. Baldry 1901, before p.107).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|''Lululaund – The Dancing Girl'' (painting and silk cloth. A.L. Baldry 1901, before p. 107), The inscription reads; "Dancing is a form of rhythm/ Rhythm is a form of music/ Music is a form of thought/ And thought is a form of divinity."]]
The very act of dancing, the steps themselves, generate an "initial skeleton of rhythmic beats" that must have preceded any separate musical accompaniment, while dance itself, as much as music, requires time-keeping&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; just as utilitarian repetitive movements such as walking, hauling and digging take on, as they become refined, something of the quality of dance.&lt;ref name="Kirstein 4"/&gt;

Musical accompaniment therefore arose in the earliest dance, so that ancient Egyptians attributed the origin of the dance to the divine Athotus, who was said to have observed that music accompanying religious rituals caused participants to move rhythmically and to have brought these movements into proportional measure. The same idea, that dance arises from musical rhythm, is still found in [[renaissance]] Europe in the works of the dancing master [[Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro]] who speaks of dance as a physical movement that arises from and expresses inward, spiritual motion agreeing with the "measures and perfect concords of harmony" that fall upon the human ear,&lt;ref name="Kirstein 4"/&gt; while, earlier, [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]], seizing upon dance as a symbol of the holy life foreshadowed in Jesus' saying "I have piped and ye have not danced",&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 11:17&lt;/ref&gt; writes;

{{quote|I can not dance unless thou leadest. If thou wouldst have me spring aloft, sing thou and I will spring, into love and from love to knowledge and from knowledge to ecstasy above all human sense&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Thoinot Arbeau]]'s celebrated 16th century dance-treatise ''Orchésographie'', indeed, begins with definitions of over eighty distinct drum-rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dancing with Helen Moller; her own statement of her philosophy and practice and teaching formed upon the classic Greek model, and adapted to meet the aesthetic and hygienic needs of to-day, with (14784705065).jpg|thumb|right|Helen Moller]]
As has been shown above, dance has been represented through the ages as having emerged as a response to music yet, as [[Lincoln Kirstein]] implied, it is at least as likely that primitive music arose from dance. Shawn concurs, stating that dance "was the first art of the human race, and the matrix out of which all other arts grew" and that even the "[[Meter (poetry)|metre]] in our poetry today is a result of the accents necessitated by body movement, as the dancing and reciting were performed simultaneously"&lt;ref name="Shawn 50"/&gt; – an assertion somewhat supported by the common use of the term "foot" to describe the fundamental rhythmic units of poetry.

[[Percy Scholes|Scholes]], not a dancer but a musician, offers support for this view, stating that the steady measures of music, of two, three or four beats to the bar, its equal and balanced phrases, regular cadences, contrasts and repetitions, may all be attributed to the "incalculable" influence of dance upon music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholes |first=Percy A. |authorlink1= Percy Scholes |title= The Oxford Companion to Music |edition= 10 |year= 1977 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= |chapter=Dance |ref= CITEREFScholes1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]], primarily a musician and teacher, relates how a study of the physical movements of pianists led him "to the discovery that musical sensations of a rhythmic nature call for the muscular and nervous response of the whole organism", to develop "a special training designed to regulate nervous reactions and effect a co-ordination of muscles and nerves" and ultimately to seek the connections between "the art of music and the art of dance", which he formulated into his system of [[Dalcroze Eurhythmics|eurhythmics]].&lt;ref&gt;Émile Jaques-Dalcroze, ''Rhythm, Music and Education'', 1973, The Dalcroze Society, London, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that "musical rhythm is only the transposition into sound of movements and dynamisms spontaneously and involuntarily expressing emotion".&lt;ref&gt;Émile Jaques-Dalcroze, ''Rhythm, Music and Education'', 1973, The Dalcroze Society, London, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, though doubtless, as Shawn asserts, "it is quite possible to develop the dance without music and... music is perfectly capable of standing on its own feet without any assistance from the dance", nevertheless the "two arts will always be related and the relationship can be profitable both to the dance and to music",&lt;ref&gt;Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; the precedence of one art over the other being a moot point. The [[Common metre|common ballad measures]] of hymns and folk-songs takes their name from dance, as does the [[Carol (music)|carol]], originally a [[circle dance]]. Many purely musical pieces have been named "[[waltz]]" or "[[minuet]]", for example, while many [[concert dance]]s have been produced that are based upon abstract musical pieces, such as ''[[2 and 3 Part Inventions]], [[Adams Violin Concerto]]'' and ''[[Andantino (ballet)|Andantino]]''. Similarly, poems are often structured and named after dances or musical works, while dance and music have both drawn their conception of "measure" or "metre" from poetry.

Shawn quotes with approval the statement of Dalcroze that, while the art of musical rhythm consists in differentiating and combining time durations, pauses and accents "according to physiological law", that of "plastic rhythm" (i.e. dance) "is to designate movement in space, to interpret long time-values by slow movements and short ones by quick movements, regulate pauses by their divers successions and express sound accentuations in their multiple nuances by additions of bodily weight, by means of muscular innervations".

Shawn nevertheless points out that the system of musical time is a "man-made, artificial thing.... a manufactured tool, whereas rhythm is something that has always existed and depends on man not at all", being "the continuous flowing time which our human minds cut up into convenient units", suggesting that music might be revivified by a return to the values and the time-perception of dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

The early-20th-century American dancer Helen Moller stated simply that "it is rhythm and form more than harmony and color which, from the beginning, has bound music, poetry and dancing together in a union that is indissoluble."&lt;ref&gt;Moller, Helen and Dunham, Curtis, ''Dancing with Helen Moller'', 1918, John Lane (New York and London), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches to dance==

===Concert dance===
Concert dance, like [[opera]], generally depends for its large-scale form upon a [[narrative]] [[dramatic structure]]. The movements and gestures of the [[choreography]] are primarily intended to [[mime]] the personality and aims of the characters and their part in the plot.&lt;ref&gt;Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Such theatrical requirements tend towards longer, freer movements than those usual in non-narrative dance styles. On the other hand, the ''[[ballet blanc]]'', developed in the 19th century, allows interludes of rhythmic dance that developed into entirely "plotless" ballets in the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;Minden, Eliza Gaynor, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S-RuSzcrBnAC&amp;dq=%22ballet+blanc%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Ballet Companion: A Dancer's Guide''], Simon and Schuster, 2007, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and that allowed fast, rhythmic dance-steps such as those of the ''petit allegro''. A well-known example is ''[[Danse des petits cygnes|The Cygnets' Dance]]'' in act two of ''[[Swan Lake]]''.

The [[ballet]] developed out of courtly dramatic productions of 16th- and 17th-century France and Italy and for some time dancers performed dances developed from those familiar from the musical suite,&lt;ref&gt;Thoinot Arbeau, ''Orchesography'', trans. by Mary Stewart Evans, with notes by Julia Sutton, New York: Dover, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; all of which were defined by definite rhythms closely identified with each dance. These appeared as [[character dance]]s in the era of [[romantic nationalism]].

Ballet reached widespread vogue in the romantic era, accompanied by a larger orchestra and grander musical conceptions that did not lend themselves easily to rhythmic clarity and by dance that emphasised dramatic mime. A broader concept of rhythm was needed, that which [[Rudolf Laban]] terms the "rhythm and shape" of movement that communicates character, emotion and intention,&lt;ref&gt;Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, pp. 2, 4 ''et passim''&lt;/ref&gt; while only certain scenes required the exact synchronisation of step and music essential to other dance styles, so that, to Laban, modern Europeans seemed totally unable to grasp the meaning of "primitive rhythmic movements",&lt;ref&gt;Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; a situation that began to change in the 20th century with such productions as [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' with its new rhythmic language evoking primal feelings of a primitive past.&lt;ref&gt;Abigail Wagner, [https://www.lawrence.edu/mfhe/www_web_student/Everyone/A%20Different%20Type%20of%20Rhythm.pdf ''A Different Type of Rhythm''], Lawrence University, Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian classical dance styles, like ballet, are often in dramatic form, so that there is a similar complementarity between narrative expression and "pure" dance. In this case, however, the two are separately defined, though not always separately performed. The rhythmic elements, which are abstract and technical, are known as ''nritta''. Both this and expressive dance ''(nritya)'', though, are closely tied to the rhythmic system (''[[Tala (music)|tala]]''). Teachers have adapted the spoken rhythmic mnemonic system called ''[[Bol (music)|bol]]'' to the needs of dancers.

Japanese classical dance-theatre styles such as [[Kabuki]] and [[Noh]], like Indian dance-drama, distinguish between narrative and abstract dance productions. The three main categories of kabuki are ''[[jidaimono]]'' (historical), ''[[sewamono]]'' (domestic) and ''[[shosagoto]]'' (dance pieces).&lt;ref name="Kabuki MIT Global Shakespeares"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://globalshakespeares.mit.edu/glossary/kabuki/ | title=Kabuki « MIT Global Shakespeares | accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat similarly, Noh distinguishes between ''Geki Noh'', based around the advancement of plot and the narration of action, and ''Furyū Noh'', dance pieces involving acrobatics, stage properties, multiple characters and elaborate stage action.&lt;ref name="Ortolani"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ge8cWl8OT3gC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=mugen-no+Genzai-no+waki-no#v=onepage&amp;q=mugen-no%20Genzai-no%20waki-no&amp;f=false |page=132 |title=The Japanese theatre: from shamanistic ritual to contemporary pluralism |first=Benito |last=Ortolani| publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995 |isbn=978-0691043333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Participatory and social dance===
[[Social dances]], those intended for participation rather than for an audience, may include various forms of mime and narrative, but are typically set much more closely to the rhythmic pattern of music, so that terms like [[waltz]] and [[polka]] refer as much to musical pieces as to the dance itself. The rhythm of the dancers' feet may even form an essential part of the music, as in [[tap dance]]. African dance, for example, is rooted in fixed basic steps, but may also allow a high degree of rhythmic interpretation: the feet or the trunk mark the basic pulse while cross-rhythms are picked up by shoulders, knees, or head, with the best dancers simultaneously giving plastic expression to all the elements of the [[polyrhythm]]ic pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Ayansu, E.S. and Whitfield, P. (eds.), ''The Rhythms Of Life'', Marshall Editions, 1982, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural traditions==

{{main|African dance}}

Dance in Africa is deeply integrated into society and major events in a community are frequently reflected in dances: dances are performed for births and funerals, weddings and wars.&lt;ref name="WelshHanley2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kariamu Welsh|author2=Elizabeth A.

Thousands of dances are performed around the continent. These may be divided into traditional, neotraditional, and classical styles: [[folklore|folkloric]] dances of a particular society, dances created more recently in imitation of traditional styles, and dances transmitted more formally in schools or private lessons.&lt;ref name="WelshHanley2010" /&gt;{{rp|18}} African dance has been altered by many forces, such as European [[missionaries]] and [[colonialist]] governments, who often suppressed local dance traditions as licentious or distracting.&lt;ref name="Hanna1973" /&gt; Dance in contemporary African cultures still serves its traditional functions in new contexts; dance may celebrate the inauguration of a hospital, build community for rural migrants in unfamiliar cities, and be incorporated into Christian church ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Hanna1973" /&gt;

[[File:Nandini Ghosal.jpg|thumb|left|An Indian classical dancer]]

===Asia===

All [[Classical Indian dance|Indian classical dances]] are to varying degrees rooted in the ''[[Natyashastra]]'' and therefore share common features: for example, the ''mudra''s (hand positions), some body positions, and the inclusion of dramatic or expressive acting or [[abhinaya]]. Indian classical music provides accompaniment and dancers of nearly all the styles wear bells around their ankles to counterpoint and complement the percussion.

There are now many regional varieties of [[Indian classical dance]]. Dances like ''"Odra Magadhi"'', which after decades long debate, has been traced to present day Mithila, [[Odisha]] region's dance form of [[Odissi]] (Orissi), indicate influence of dances in cultural interactions between different regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exoticindiaart.com/article/dance Exoticindiaart.com], Dance: The Living Spirit of Indian Arts, by Prof. P.C. Jain and Dr. Daljeet.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Punjab region|Punjab]] area overlapping India and [[Pakistan]] is the place of origin of [[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]]. It is widely known both as a style of music and a dance. It is mostly related to ancient harvest celebrations, love, patriotism or social issues. Its music is coordinated by a musical instrument called the 'Dhol'. Bhangra is not just music but a dance, a celebration of the harvest where people beat the dhol (drum), sing Boliyaan (lyrics) and dance. It developed further with the Vaisakhi festival of the [[Sikh]]s.

The [[dances of Sri Lanka]] include the devil dances (''yakun natima''), a carefully crafted ritual reaching far back into Sri Lanka's pre-Buddhist past that combines ancient "[[Ayurvedic]]" concepts of disease causation with [[psychological manipulation]] and combines many aspects including Sinhalese cosmology. Their influence can be seen on the [[classical dances of Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lankalibrary.com/rit/yakun%20natuma.htm Lankalibrary.com], "The yakun natima&amp;nbsp;— devil dance ritual of Sri Lanka"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Middle Eastern dance|dances of the Middle East]] are usually the traditional forms of [[circle dance|circle dancing]] which are modernized to an extent. They would include [[dabke]], [[tamzara]], [[Assyrian folk dance]], [[Kurdish dance]], [[Armenian dance]] and [[Turkish dance]], among others.&lt;ref name="Badley 2000. pp 391-395"&gt;Badley, Bill and Zein al Jundi. "Europe Meets Asia". 2000. In Broughton, Simon and Ellingham, Mark with McConnachie, James and Duane, Orla (Ed.), World Music, Vol. 1: Africa, Europe and the Middle East, pp. 391–395. Rough Guides Ltd, Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Recep Albayrak Hacaloğlu. Azeri Türkçesi dil kilavuzu. Hacaloğlu, 1992; p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; All these forms of dances would usually involve participants engaging each other by holding hands or arms (depending on the style of the dance). They would make rhythmic moves with their legs and shoulders as they curve around the dance floor. The head of the dance would generally hold a [[Walking stick|cane]] or [[handkerchief]].&lt;ref name="Badley 2000. pp 391-395"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Subhi Anwar Rashid, Mesopotamien, Abb 137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe and North America===
{{Main|Concert dance}}
[[Folk dance]]s vary across Europe and may date back hundreds or thousands of years, but many have features in common such as [[group dance|group participation]] led by a [[Caller (dancing)|caller]], hand-holding or arm-linking between participants, and fixed musical forms known as caroles.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ballet in Western Culture: A History of Its Origins and Evolution|pages=10–11|year=2002|isbn=978-0415942577|author=Carol Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, such as the [[maypole]] dance are common to many nations, while others such as the [[céilidh]] and the [[polka]] are deeply-rooted in a single culture. Some European folk dances such as the [[square dance]] were brought to the [[New World]] and subsequently became part of American culture.

[[Ballet]] developed first in Italy and then in France from lavish court spectacles that combined music, drama, poetry, song, costumes and dance. Members of the court nobility took part as performers. During the reign of [[Louis XIV]], himself a dancer, dance became more codified. Professional dancers began to take the place of court amateurs, and ballet masters were licensed by the French government. The first ballet dance academy was the Académie Royale de Danse (Royal Dance Academy), opened in Paris in 1661. Shortly thereafter, the first institutionalized ballet troupe, associated with the Academy, was formed; this troupe began as an all-male ensemble but by 1681 opened to include women as well.&lt;ref name="lecomte"/&gt;

[[20th century concert dance]] brought an explosion of innovation in dance style characterized by an exploration of freer technique. Early pioneers of what became known as [[modern dance]] include [[Loie Fuller]], [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Mary Wigman]] and [[Ruth St. Denis]]. The relationship of music to dance serves as the basis for [[Eurhythmics]], devised by [[Emile Jaques-Dalcroze]], which was influential to the development of Modern dance and modern ballet through artists such as [[Marie Rambert]]. [[Eurythmy]], developed by [[Rudolf Steiner]] and [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]], combines formal elements reminiscent of traditional dance with the new freer style, and introduced a complex new vocabulary to dance. In the 1920s, important founders of the new style such as [[Martha Graham]] and [[Doris Humphrey]] began their work. Since this time, a wide variety of dance styles have been developed; see [[Modern dance]].

[[African American dance]] developed in everyday spaces, rather than in dance studios, schools or companies. [[Tap dance]], [[disco]], [[jazz dance]], [[swing dance]], [[hip hop dance]], the [[lindy hop]] with its relationship to [[rock and roll|rock and roll music]] and [[rock and roll (dance)|rock and roll dance]] have had a global influence. Dance styles fusing classical ballet technique with African-American dance have also appeared in the 21st century, including [[Hiplet (dance style)|Hiplet]].&lt;ref name=kourlas&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/arts/dance/hiplet-an-implausible-hybrid-plants-itself-on-pointe.html|title=Hiplet: An Implausible Hybrid Plants Itself on Pointe|last=Kourlas|first=Gia|date=2016-09-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
Dance is central to [[Latin America]]n social life and culture. Brazilian [[Samba (Brazilian dance)|Samba]], Argentinian [[tango]], and Cuban [[salsa (dance)|salsa]] are internationally popular partner dances, and other national dances—[[merengue (dance)|merengue]], [[cueca]], [[plena]], [[jarabe]], [[joropo]], [[marinera]], [[cumbia]], and others—are important components of their respective countries' cultures.&lt;ref name="Chasteen2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Charles Chasteen|title=National Rhythms, African Roots: The Deep History of Latin American Popular Dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yBvvvrydCNwC&amp;pg=PR8|date=1 January 2004|publisher=UNM Press|isbn=978-0826329417|pages=8–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional [[Carnival]] festivals incorporate these and other dances in enormous celebrations.&lt;ref name="MusmonHanley2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret Musmon|author2=Elizabeth A.

Dance has played an important role in forging a collective identity among the many cultural and ethnic groups of [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name="DelgadoMuñoz1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Celeste Fraser Delgado|author2=José Esteban Muñoz|title=Everynight Life: Culture and Dance in Latin/o America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gefjk07Y9kEC&amp;pg=PA3|year=1997|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0822319191|pages=9–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dance served to unite the many African, European, and indigenous peoples of the region.&lt;ref name="Chasteen2004"/&gt; Certain dance genres, such as [[capoeira]], and body movements, especially the characteristic ''quebrada'' or [[pelvis]] swing, have been variously banned and celebrated throughout Latin American history.&lt;ref name="DelgadoMuñoz1997"/&gt;{{clear}}

===United States===
Hip Hop originated in New York, specifically in the area known as the Bronx. It was created for those who struggled in society and didn't seem to have a voice in the community that surrounded them because of their lack of wealth. It helped those in the same situation come together and speak about difficult topics by using movement and feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thoughteconomics.com/the-role-of-hip-hop-in-culture/|title=The Role of Hip Hop in Culture |date=2015-11-03|work=Thought Economics|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dance education==

Dance studies are offered through the [[The Arts|arts]] and [[humanities]] programs of many higher education institutions. Some universities offer [[Bachelor of Arts]] and higher [[academic degree]]s in Dance. A dance study curriculum may encompass a diverse range of courses and topics, including dance practice and performance, choreography, [[ethnochoreology]], [[kinesiology]], [[dance notation]], and [[dance therapy]].

==Occupations==
{{Main|List of dance occupations}}

===Professional dancers===
Professional dancers are usually employed on contract or for particular performances or productions. The professional life of a dancer is generally one of constantly changing work situations, strong competitive pressure and low pay. Consequently, professional dancers often must supplement their incomes to achieve financial stability. In the U.S. many professional dancers belong to unions (such as the [[American Guild of Musical Artists]], [[Screen Actors Guild]] and [[Actors' Equity Association]]) that establish working conditions and minimum salaries for their members. Professional dancers must possess large amounts of athleticism. To lead a successful career, it is advantageous to be versatile in many styles of dance, have a strong technical background and to utilize other forms of physical training to remain fit and healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sagolla|first=Lisa|date=April 24, 2008|title=Untitled|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=fa35d8ae-239b-4764-b82f-f58a07a15475%40sessionmgr4006&amp;vid=11&amp;hid=4104&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=32038206&amp;db=ibh|journal=International Bibliography of Theatre &amp; Dance with Full Text|volume= 15| issue = 17 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dance teachers===
Dance teachers typically focus on teaching dance performance, or coaching competitive dancers, or both. They typically have performance experience in the types of dance they teach or coach. For example, [[dancesport]] teachers and coaches are often tournament dancers or former dancesport performers. Dance teachers may be self-employed, or employed by [[dance school]]s or general education institutions with dance programs. Some work for university programs or other schools that are associated with professional classical dance (e.g., ballet) or modern dance companies. Others are employed by smaller, privately owned dance schools that offer dance training and performance coaching for various types of dance.

===Choreographers===
[[Choreography (dance)|Choreographers]] are often university trained and are typically employed for particular projects or, more rarely may work on contract as the resident choreographer for a specific dance company.

==Competitions==
[[File:MIT 2006 Standard Prechamp Final 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.45|An amateur dancesport competition, featuring the [[Viennese Waltz]]]]

A '''dance competition''' is an organized event in which contestants perform dances before a judge or judges for awards, and in some cases, monetary prizes. There are several major types of dance competitions, distinguished primarily by the style or styles of dances performed. Major types of dance competitions include:
* '''[[Competitive dance]]''', in which a variety of theater dance styles, such as [[acro dance|acro]], [[ballet]], [[jazz dance|jazz]], [[hip-hop]], [[lyrical dance|lyrical]], and [[tap dance|tap]], are permitted.
* '''Open''' competitions, that permit a wide variety of dance styles. An example of this is the TV program ''[[So You Think You Can Dance]]''.
* '''[[Dancesport]]''', which is focused exclusively on [[ballroom dance|ballroom]] and [[latin dance]]. Examples of this are TV programs ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' and ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''.
* '''Single-style''' competitions, such as; [[Scottish highland dance|highland dance]], [[dance squad|dance team]], and [[Irish dance]], that only permit a single dance style.

In addition, there are numerous dance competitions shows [[Dance on television|presented on television]] and other mass media.

'''Dominique Caillat''' (born in Washington D.C.) is a Swiss playwright and writer. She lives in [[Berlin]] and works in German, French and English.
__TOC__

==Life and work==
After studying law and passing bar examinations in [[Geneva]] and New York City, Dominique Caillat briefly worked as an international lawyer before turning to literature and the stage, receiving a basic training in acting and directing.&lt;ref Name=DCBio&gt;[http://www.dominique-caillat.com/english/bio_2.html Dominique Caillat’s biography] (self description)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 she moved to Germany and established in Burg Namedy, near [[Koblenz]], the youth acting school "Theater in der Vorburg". Over the next 6 years, she wrote and directed 6 plays for her company, which soon became a regular guest at theatre events and festivals. In 1998, Caillat's play and production of ''Leb wohl, Schmetterling''&lt;ref name=Schmett&gt;Dominique Caillat: [http://www.dominique-caillat.com/english/t_schmetterling.html ''Leb wohl, Schmetterling''] – short presentation of the play&lt;/ref&gt; (Farewell Butterfly), about the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Terezin ghettho]], won the [[Rheinland-Pfalz]] Youth Cultural Prize and was performed in the [[German Parliament]] for the Commemoration of the Victims of [[National Socialism]], as well as in [[Terezin]], Prague, [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]], among many other cities. Caillat closed the "Theater in der Vorburg" in 2000, to devote herself to writing fiction, non-fiction and plays.

Her work focuses on sensitive political and social issues, and is typically based on comprehensive research.&lt;ref Name=DCBio /&gt; Her past topics include the [[Third Reich]], to which she devoted two plays, ''Leb wohl, Schmetterling''&lt;ref name=Schmett /&gt; and ''Wir gehören zusammen'',&lt;ref name=Wir&gt;Dominique Caillat: [http://www.dominique-caillat.com/english/t_ballade.html ''Wir gehören zusammen''] – short presentation of the play&lt;/ref&gt; as well as scenes for [[Hans Krása|Hans Krasá's]] children opera [[Brundibár]],&lt;ref name=Brun&gt;Dominique Caillat: [http://www.dominique-caillat.com/english/t_brundibar.html ''Brundibár''] – short presentation of the scenes&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Prologue|Prolog]], [[Scene (drama)|Szene]] [[Epilogue|und Epilog]]'', commissioned by the [[Wiener Kammeroper|Vienna Chamber opera]]. She also wrote extensively about the [[Arab–Israeli conflict|Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], spending much time in the [[Middle-East]] conducting interviews on both sides of the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]]. Her experiences are summarized in her book ''La Paix ou la mort – Dans les coulisses du drame isrélo-palestinien''&lt;ref name=Paix /&gt; (Peace or Death&lt;ref&gt;''Peace or Death'': [http://storylines-jerusalem.blogspot.com/2006/01/human-rights-organisation-machsom.html Israeli Women Challenge Soldiers at the Checkpoints] – English version of one chapter of the French book ''La Paix ou la mort'' by Dominique Caillat&lt;/ref&gt;). Her latest play, commissioned by the Swiss [[Academy|Academy of]] [[Natural Science]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scnat.ch/index.en.php Swiss Academy of Natural Science]&lt;/ref&gt; deals with [[Charles Darwin]], [[evolution]] and [[bioethics]] (''La Confession de Darwin''&lt;ref name=Beicht&gt;Dominique Caillat: [http://www.dominique-caillat.com/english/t_darwin.html ''Darwins Beichte''] – short presentation of the play&lt;/ref&gt; and its German version ''Darwins Beichte'').

An '''entertainment district''' is a type of [[arts district]] with a high concentration of [[movie theater]]s, [[theatres]] or other entertainment venues.&lt;ref name="Forsher"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forsher|first=James|title=The Community of Cinema: How Cinema and Spectacle Transformed the American Downtown|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=1ONsSIij2G0C&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=%22Entertainment+district%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ho2xVOCjMIn0yASHiIHoAQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Entertainment%20district%22&amp;f=false|date=30 April 2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0275973551|pages=5–6|chapter=Movie Theaters as Indicators of Urban Vitality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such areas may be officially designated by local governments with [[functional zoning]] regulations, as well as public and private investment in distinctive [[urban design]].

==Cause and effects of entertainment districts==
Entertainment districts have economically helped downtowns and cities thrive through development of various businesses that attract tourism and commerce. As entertainment districts tend to create crowds, facilitation and management by police is required to promote safety and regulation. The main source that requires police interaction in the entertainment districts are the nightclubs and bars that may promote intoxication and leads towards miscreant behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berkley|first1=Blair J.|last2=Thayer|first2=John R.|title=Policing Entertainment Districts|journal=Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies &amp; Management|date=2000|volume=23|issue=4|page=466-91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police and security deal with behavior consisting of bar fights, overcrowding, and public urination. The requirement of regulation and maintenance of these areas are important for the safety of the individuals utilizing and benefiting from the entertainment districts.

'''Friedrich Adler''' (29 April 1878 – ca. 11 July 1942) was a [[Germany|German]] [[academia|academic]], [[artist]] and [[designer]]. He was especially renowned for his accomplishments in designing metalwork in the [[Art nouveau]] and [[Art deco]] styles; he was also the first designer to use [[bakelite]].

Adler was born in [[Laupheim]]; his birthplace is now the ''Café Hermes'', an Art nouveau building in the style of the late [[Italian Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | title = The Jewish Past of Laupheim: The Adler Family  | work =   | publisher =   | url = http://www.culturespace.de/laupheim/english/adler.htm  | doi =   | accessdate = 2010-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1894 to 1897, he studied under [[Hermann Obrist]] and [[Wilhelm von Debschitz]], in whose [[wikt:atelier|atelier]] he also taught from 1904 to 1907, at the School for [[Applied Art]] in [[Munich]]. From 1907 to 1933, he taught at the [[Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg|School for Applied Art in Hamburg]]. In between, he also directed the mastery lessons in [[Nuremberg]], and was busy designing pieces in applied art for over fifty clients.

On 11 July 1942 Adler, who was [[Jew]]ish, was deported to the [[extermination camp]] [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], where, judged too old to work, he was killed soon afterwards. There is a [[stolperstein]] in his memory at his last place of employment in Hamburg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19362">{{Lie groups |Algebras}}

Towards the end of the nineteenth century, [[Sophus Lie]] introduced the notion of [[Lie group]] in order to study the solutions of [[ordinary differential equations]]&lt;ref name="Lie1881"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lie1890"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lie1893"/&gt; (ODEs). He showed the following main property: the order of an ordinary differential equation can be reduced by one if it is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under one-parameter Lie group of [[point transformation]]s.&lt;ref name="Olver1993"/&gt; This observation unified and extended the available integration techniques. Lie devoted the remainder of his mathematical career to developing these [[continuous group]]s that have now an impact on many areas of mathematically based sciences. The applications of Lie groups to [[differential system]]s were mainly established by Lie and [[Emmy Noether]], and then advocated by [[Élie Cartan]].

Roughly speaking, a Lie point symmetry of a system is a local group of transformations that maps every solution of the system to another solution of the same system. In other words, it maps the solution set of the system to itself. Elementary examples of Lie groups are [[Translation (geometry)|translations]], [[rotations]] and [[Scaling (geometry)|scalings]].

The Lie symmetry theory is a well-known subject. In it are discussed [[continuous symmetry|continuous symmetries]] opposed to, for example, [[discrete symmetry|discrete symmetries]]. The literature for this theory can be found, among other places, in these notes.&lt;ref name="Olver1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olver1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BlumanKumei1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephani1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeviWinternitz2006"/&gt;

== Overview ==

=== Types of symmetries ===
Lie groups and hence their infinitesimal generators can be naturally "extended" to act on the space of independent variables, [[state variable]]s (dependent variables) and derivatives of the state variables up to any finite order. There are many other kinds of symmetries. For example, [[contact geometry|contact transformations]] let coefficients of the transformations infinitesimal generator depend also on first derivatives of the coordinates. [[Lie-Bäcklund transformation]]s let them involve derivatives up to an arbitrary order. The possibility of the existence of such symmetries was recognized by Noether.&lt;ref name="Noether1918"/&gt; For Lie point symmetries, the coefficients of the infinitesimal generators depend only on coordinates, denoted by &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Applications ===
Lie symmetries were introduced by Lie in order to solve ordinary differential equations. Another application of symmetry methods is to reduce systems of differential equations, finding equivalent systems of differential equations of simpler form. This is called [[Reduction (mathematics)|reduction]]. In the literature, one can find the classical reduction process,&lt;ref name="Olver1993"/&gt; and the [[moving frame]]-based reduction process.&lt;ref name="Cartan1935"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FelsOlver1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FelsOlver1999"/&gt; Also symmetry groups can be used for classifying different symmetry classes of solutions.

== Geometrical framework ==

=== Infinitesimal approach ===
Lie's fundamental theorems underline that Lie groups can be characterized by elements known as ''infinitesimal generators''. These mathematical objects form a [[Lie algebra]] of infinitesimal generators. Deduced "infinitesimal symmetry conditions" (defining equations of the symmetry group) can be explicitly solved in order to find the closed form of symmetry groups, and thus the associated infinitesimal generators.

Let &lt;math&gt;Z=(z_1,\dots,z_n)&lt;/math&gt; be the set of coordinates on which a system is defined where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the cardinal of &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;. An infinitesimal generator &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; in the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}(Z)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear operator &lt;math&gt;\delta : \mathbb{R}(Z)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}(Z)&lt;/math&gt; that has &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; in its kernel and that satisfies the [[Product rule|Leibniz rule]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall (f_1,f_2) \in \mathbb{R}(Z)^2, \delta f_1 f_2 = f_1 \delta f_2 + f_2 \delta f_1&lt;/math&gt;.
In the canonical basis of elementary derivations &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial z_1},\dots,\frac{\partial}{\partial z_n}\right \}&lt;/math&gt;, it is written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \xi_{z_i}(Z) \frac{\partial}{\partial z_i}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\xi_{z_i}&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}(Z)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\left\{1,\dots,n\right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Lie groups and Lie algebras of infinitesimal generators ===
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}

[[Lie algebra]]s can be generated by a generating set of infinitesimal generators as defined above. To every Lie group, one can associate a Lie algebra. Roughly, a Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[algebra]] constituted by a vector space equipped with [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] as additional operation. The base field of a Lie algebra depends on the concept of [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]. Here only finite-dimensional Lie algebras are considered.

=== Continuous dynamical systems ===

A [[dynamical system]] (or [[Flow (mathematics)|flow]]) is a one-parameter [[group action]]. Let us denote by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; such a dynamical system, more precisely, a (left-)action of a group &lt;math&gt;(G,+)&lt;/math&gt; on a [[manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rccc}
\mathcal{D} : &amp; G\times M &amp; \rightarrow &amp; M \\
&amp; \nu \times Z &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \mathcal{D}(\nu,Z)
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
such that for all point &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;:
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}(e,Z)=Z&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the neutral element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;;
* for all &lt;math&gt;(\nu, \hat{\nu})&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}(\nu,\mathcal{D}(\hat{\nu},Z))=\mathcal{D}(\nu+\hat{\nu},Z)&lt;/math&gt;.

A continuous dynamical system is defined on a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that can be identified to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; i.e. the group elements are continuous.

=== Invariants ===
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}

An [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]], roughly speaking, is an element that does not change under a transformation.

== Definition of Lie point symmetries ==

In this paragraph, we consider precisely ''expanded Lie point symmetries'' i.e. we work in an expanded space meaning that the distinction between independent variable, state variables and parameters are avoided as much as possible.

A symmetry group of a system is a continuous dynamical system defined on a local Lie group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acting on a manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. For the sake of clarity, we restrict ourselves to n-dimensional real manifolds &lt;math&gt;M=\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of system coordinates.

=== Lie point symmetries of algebraic systems ===

Let us define [[algebraic system]]s used in the forthcoming symmetry definition.

==== Algebraic systems ====

Let &lt;math&gt;F=(f_1,\dots,f_k)=(p_1/q_1,\dots,p_k/q_k)&lt;/math&gt; be a finite set of rational functions over the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; are polynomials in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}[Z]&lt;/math&gt; i.e. in variables &lt;math&gt;Z=(z_1,\dots,z_n)&lt;/math&gt; with coefficients in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. An ''algebraic system'' associated to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the following equalities and inequalities:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ccc}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
p_1(Z)= 0, \\
\vdots \\
p_k(Z)=0
\end{array}
\right.&amp; \mbox{and} &amp;
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
q_1(Z) \neq 0, \\
\vdots \\
q_k(Z) \neq 0.
\end{array}
\right.
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

An algebraic system defined by &lt;math&gt;F=(f_1,\dots,f_k)&lt;/math&gt; is ''regular'' (a.k.a. [[Smooth algebraic variety|smooth]]) if the system &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is of maximal rank &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that the [[Jacobian matrix]] &lt;math&gt;(\partial f_i / \partial z_j)&lt;/math&gt; is of rank &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; at every solution &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; of the associated semi-algebraic [[algebraic variety|variety]].

The following theorem (see th. 2.8 in ch.2 of &lt;ref name="Olver1995"/&gt;) gives necessary and sufficient conditions so that a local Lie group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a symmetry group of an algebraic system.

'''Theorem'''. Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a connected local Lie group of a continuous dynamical system acting in the n-dimensional space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;F: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;k \leq n&lt;/math&gt; define a regular system of algebraic equations:
:&lt;math&gt;
f_i(Z)=0 \quad \forall i \in \{1,\dots,k\}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a symmetry group of this algebraic system if, and only if,
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta f_i(Z)=0 \quad \forall i\in \{1,\dots,k\} \mbox{ whenever } f_1(Z)=\dots=f_k(Z)=0
&lt;/math&gt;
for every infinitesimal generator &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; in the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Example ====
Let us consider the algebraic system defined on a space of 6 variables, namely &lt;math&gt;Z=(P,Q,a,b,c,l)&lt;/math&gt; with:
:&lt;math&gt;
\left \{
\begin{array}{l}
f_1(Z)=(1-cP)+bQ + 1, \\
f_2(Z)=aP - lQ +1.
\end{array}
\right .
&lt;/math&gt;

The infinitesimal generator
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta = a(a-1) \dfrac{\partial}{\partial a} + (l+b)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial b}+ (2ac-c)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial c}+(-aP+P)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial P}
&lt;/math&gt;
is associated to one of the one-parameter symmetry groups. It acts on 4 variables, namely &lt;math&gt;a,b,c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. One can easily verify that &lt;math&gt;\delta f_1 = f_1 -f_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta f_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the relations &lt;math&gt;\delta f_1 = \delta f_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; are satisfied for any &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^6&lt;/math&gt; that vanishes the algebraic system.

=== Lie point symmetries of dynamical systems ===

Let us define systems of first-order [[ordinary differential equations|ODEs]] used in the forthcoming symmetry definition.

==== Systems of ODEs and associated infinitesimal generators ====

Let &lt;math&gt;d\cdot / dt&lt;/math&gt; be a derivation w.r.t. the continuous independent variable &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. We consider two sets &lt;math&gt;X=(x_1,\dots,x_k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Theta = (\theta_1,\dots,\theta_l)&lt;/math&gt;. The associated coordinate set is defined by &lt;math&gt;Z=(z_1,\dots,z_n)=(t,x_1,\dots,x_k,\theta_1,\dots,\theta_l)&lt;/math&gt; and its cardinal is &lt;math&gt;n=1+k+l&lt;/math&gt;. With these notations, a ''system of first-order ODEs'' is a system where:
:&lt;math&gt;
\left \{
\begin{array}{l}
\dfrac{d x_i}{dt} = f_i(Z) \mbox{ with } f_i \in \mathbb{R}(Z) \quad \forall i \in \{1,\dots,k\}, \\
\dfrac{d \theta_j}{dt} = 0 \quad \forall j \in \{1,\dots,l\}
\end{array}
\right .
&lt;/math&gt;
and the set &lt;math&gt;F=(f_1,\dots,f_k)&lt;/math&gt; specifies the evolution of state variables of ODEs w.r.t. the independent variable. The elements of the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are called ''state variables'', these of &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; ''parameters''.

One can associate also a continuous dynamical system to a system of ODEs by resolving its equations.

An infinitesimal generator is a derivation that is closely related to systems of ODEs (more precisely to continuous dynamical systems). For the link between a system of ODEs, the associated vector field and the infinitesimal generator, see section 1.3 of.&lt;ref name="Olver1993"/&gt; The infinitesimal generator &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; associated to a system of ODEs, described as above, is defined with the same notations as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial t} + \sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i(Z) \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\cdot
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Definition of Lie point symmetries ====

Here is a geometrical definition of such symmetries. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous dynamical system and &lt;math&gt;\delta_\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; its infinitesimal generator. A continuous dynamical system &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is a Lie point symmetry of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; if, and only if, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; sends every orbit of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; to an orbit. Hence, the infinitesimal generator &lt;math&gt;\delta_\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the following relation&lt;ref name="Stephani1989"/&gt; based on [[Lie bracket]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
[\delta_\mathcal{D}, \delta_\mathcal{S}] = \lambda \delta_\mathcal{D}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is any constant of &lt;math&gt;\delta_\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta_\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; i.e. &lt;math&gt;\delta_\mathcal{D}\lambda = \delta_\mathcal{S} \lambda = 0&lt;/math&gt;. These generators are linearly independent.

One does not need the explicit formulas of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; in order to compute the infinitesimal generators of its symmetries.

=== Example ===

Consider [[Pierre François Verhulst]]'s [[logistic growth]] model with linear predation,&lt;ref name="Murray2002"/&gt; where the state variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; represents a population. The parameter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the difference between the growth and predation rate and the parameter &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the receptive capacity of the environment:
:&lt;math&gt;
\dfrac{dx}{dt}= (a-bx)x, \dfrac{da}{dt}=\dfrac{db}{dt}=0.
&lt;/math&gt;

The continuous dynamical system associated to this system of ODEs is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rccc}
\mathcal{D}: &amp; (\mathbb{R},+) \times \mathbb{R}^4 &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \mathbb{R}^4 \\
&amp; (\hat{t},(t,x,a,b)) &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \left(t+\hat{t}, \frac{axe^{a\hat{t}}}{a-(1-e^{a\hat{t}})bx}, a, b\right).
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
The independent variable &lt;math&gt;\hat{t}&lt;/math&gt; varies continuously; thus the associated group can be identified with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

The infinitesimal generator associated to this system of ODEs is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta_\mathcal{D} = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial t} + ((a-bx)x)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}\cdot
&lt;/math&gt;

The following infinitesimal generators belong to the 2-dimensional symmetry group of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta_{\mathcal{S}_1} = -x \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}+b\dfrac{\partial}{\partial b},
\quad
\delta_{\mathcal{S}_2} = t\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}-x\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}-a\dfrac{\partial}{\partial a}
\cdot
&lt;/math&gt;

== Software ==

There exist many software packages in this area.&lt;ref name="Heck2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwarz1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimas2005"/&gt; For example, the package liesymm of [[Maple (software)|Maple]] provides some Lie symmetry methods for [[partial differential equation|PDEs]].&lt;ref name="CarminatiDevittFee1992"/&gt; It manipulates integration of determining systems and also [[differential form]]s. Despite its success on small systems, its integration capabilities for solving determining systems automatically are limited by complexity issues. The DETools package uses the prolongation of [[vector field]]s for searching Lie symmetries of ODEs. Finding Lie symmetries for ODEs, in the general case, may be as complicated as solving the original system.

It is a monument dedicated to [[Freedom of thought|freedom of conscience]] and to [[immigration]] with the spirit of [[Europeanism]].

The original Bohemian Church otherwise Bethlehem Church was built between 1733 and 1735 in the middle of the [[Friedrichstadt (Berlin)|Friedrichstadt]] (now the Mitte district) of Berlin, representing one of the most positive chapters of relations between [[Germany]] and [[Bohemia]]. Thanks to King [[Frederick William I of Prussia]], [[Czechs|Czech]] [[refugee]]s leaving their homeland for religious reasons were admitted to the Friedrichstadt district of Berlin. It was a monument to the [[Toleration|tolerance]] pervading the foundation of the [[Prussia|Prussian State]].

In 1943, it was badly damaged by bombing. Later, in 1963, the church was demolished and the site incorporated into the facilities of [[Checkpoint Charlie]].

'''Nise-e''' (似絵), or "likeness pictures," were a style of [[portrait painting|portraiture]] popular in the [[Court (royal)|court]] circles of Japan's [[Kamakura period]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/nise-e|title=nise-e {{!}} Japanese art|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 12th century [[Japanese art]] was purely religious in character, but nise-e introduced the realistic depiction of [[Laity|lay]] figures such as [[Courtier|courtiers]] and [[samurai]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Evgeny|date=2013|title=Zen Portraits Chinzō: Why do They Look as They do?|url=https://terebess.hu/zen/szoto/Chinzo.docx|journal=Terebess Asia Online|volume=|pages=|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of nise-e even helped to end the [[taboo]] against artistic depictions of the emperor, with one of earliest nise-e to depict a living [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] being a portrait of [[Emperor Hanazono]] by [https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Emperor_Hanazono_large.jpg Gōshin].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirayama|first=Mikiko|title=The Emperor's New Clothes: Japanese Visuality and Imperial Portrait Photography|journal=History of Photography|volume=33|issue=2|pages=165–184|doi=10.1080/03087290902768099|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of a nise-e portrait was to capture a man's character with a few simple lines; and the work served as a veneration of his accomplishments.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[File:BrownlowasLt.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Wallace Brownlow]] portraying Richard Cholmondeley in ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', 1888]]

'''Sir Richard Cholmondeley''' (or '''Cholmeley''') (c. 1460–1521) was an English farmer and soldier, who served as [[Lieutenant of the Tower of London]] from 1513 to 1520 during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].  He is remembered because of his tomb at the Tower of London and because he is fictionalized as a character in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s darkly [[comic opera]], ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]''.  Cholmeley's name is frequently misspelled as Cholmondeley because of its misspelling in the plaque on his tomb, which led to the misspelling of the character's name in the opera; other branches of Cholmeley's family use the longer spelling.

Knighted in 1497 for valour in battle against the Scots, Cholmeley continued to serve as a soldier until 1513, becoming entrusted with many positions of responsibility for security of castles and fortifications in England.  He was successful as a farmer and a shrewd investor in land, much increasing his family wealth.  As Lieutenant of the Tower of London, he drew criticism for his reaction to the [[Evil May Day]] riots of 1517, when he ordered the firing of some of the Tower's artillery at the city to suppress rioting.  He was also responsible for the rebuilding of the chapel of [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|St Peter ad Vincula]] at the Tower.   His illegitimate son, [[Roger Cholmeley]], became [[Lord Chief Justice]] of the court of [[King's Bench]].

==Life and career==
Cholmeley (pronounced "Chumley") was born at Chorley, a small settlement approximately six miles south west of [[Nantwich]], [[Cheshire]] near [[Cholmondeley, Cheshire|Cholmondeley]], the eldest son of Joan Eyton and John Cholmeley, wealthy sheep farmers and land owners.&lt;ref&gt;Heraldic Visitations Harl 1424 fo.36b, Harl 1505 fo.34b, Cholmondleigh vulgo Cholmeley of Chomley&lt;/ref&gt;  See the heading "Tomb and Family Name", below, regarding the family name.  While Richard was very young, his family moved to East [[Yorkshire]], where his maternal grandfather held extensive estates.&lt;ref name=CheshireMag&gt;{{cite journal| last=Chamley| first=Benson|date=June 2003| title=Sir Richard Cholmondeley, Cheshire's most famous unknown| journal=The Family History Society of Cheshire Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Cholmeley was appointed Bailiff of York in 1492 and [[High Sheriff of Northumberland]] in 1495. In 1497, he served under [[Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey]] to repel a [[Pedro de Ayala#The Sieges of Norham and Ayton Castles|Scots assault]] at [[Norham]] Castle, a stronghold of the Bishopric of [[Durham, England|Durham]].&lt;ref name=Fiction&gt;Chamley, Benson.  "''The Yeomen of the Guard'': Fact or Fiction", ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', vol. 3, issue 21, Summer 2007, pp. 648–57&lt;/ref&gt;  For his service, Cholmeley was knighted in the field at Ayton by Lord Surrey as representative of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, William A. ''The Knights of England'', vol. 2, Sherratt and Hughes (1906, reprinted 1971, {{ISBN|0-900455-11-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, he was appointed Lieutenant of [[Berwick upon Tweed]] and Governor of [[Kingston upon Hull]].  In 1499, Cholmeley and his younger brother Roger were appointed Constables of [[Pickering Castle]], [[North Yorkshire]] and Stewards of the Honour and Foresters of the Royal Forest.&lt;ref name=Fiction/&gt;  While Roger settled in the constable's lodgings at the castle, Sir Richard purchased a small estate and house at nearby Thornton on the Hill (now part of [[Thornton-le-Dale]]).  In 1506, Cholmeley was appointed Collector of the Great Custom in the [[Port of London]].&lt;ref&gt;25 April 1506 (Membrane 15 no. 847), Appointment of Richard Cholmeley, Knight, as collector of the great custom in the port of London and in all adjacent ports and places in the place of William Tystede, late collector&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1513, the Scots invaded England to meet their treaty obligations to France under the [[Auld Alliance]]. At the [[Battle of Flodden]], the English, including a Cheshire levy under Cholmeley's command, successfully repelled the Scots. He had brought with him the Citizen Yeomenry of Hull. With English victory, Lord Surrey was restored as [[Duke of Norfolk]].&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;

===Lieutenant of the Tower===
In October 1513, Cholmeley was appointed [[Lieutenant of the Tower of London]] and Supervisor General of [[Richmond Castle]] and eleven other Yorkshire castles and manors.&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some sources list Chomondeley's appointment as Lieutenant in 1509, but this is not consistent with the records of Cholmondeley's military service. See White, William. [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA62 ''Notes and Queries''], Oxford University Press, 1908&lt;/ref&gt; There was no suitable house for Cholmeley and his family within the Tower precincts, and so he purchased a house in nearby [[Barking, London|Barking]], where he lived while serving as Lieutenant of the Tower.&lt;ref name=Fiction/&gt; The Lieutenant served under the [[Constable of the Tower]], at the time [[Thomas Lovell]].&lt;ref&gt;White, William. [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA62 ''Notes and Queries''], Oxford University Press, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bayley, p. 664&lt;/ref&gt; The duties of the Lieutenant included defence, maintenance, and custody of the prisoners at the Tower, including escorting prisoners of note to trial at [[Westminster Hall]] which, at that time, housed the courts of law.  Cholmeley's maintenance works included the complete rebuilding of the chapel of [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|St Peter ad Vincula]], the parish church of the Tower of London, which had been largely destroyed by fire in 1512.  The construction was carried out in 1519&amp;ndash;20.&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;

[[File:Yeomen 1906.jpg|thumb|300px|Scene from ''The Yeomen of the Guard'']]
Cholmeley lost some favour with the City of London authorities because of his reaction to the [[Evil May Day]] riots of 1517. During the riots, he furiously ordered the firing of some of the Tower's artillery at the city during rioting by gangs of young Londoners, who attacked foreigners, especially the wealthy foreign merchants and bankers of [[Lombard Street, London]] and who took control of London for several days.  This drew the ire of the city elders.  In 1520, he resigned his post at the Tower due to ill health.  He died in March 1521 (1522 by the modern calendar system) in [[St Katharine's by the Tower]].&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;

Cholmeley is the only historical character to appear in a [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] opera, ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]''.  In the story of that opera, while serving as Lieutenant of the Tower, Cholmeley finds that a prominent prisoner, scheduled to be executed, has escaped.  He launches a full-scale investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Bradley|year=1996|title=The Complete Annotated Gilbert and Sullivan|location=Oxford, England|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=772|isbn = 0-19-816503-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Cholmeley became very wealthy by inheritance and shrewd property investments.  At the time of his death, he held extensive estates in [[Northumberland]], [[Cumberland]], [[Yorkshire]], [[Cambridgeshire]], [[Essex]], [[Middlesex]], [[Kent]] and Calais, along with several properties in London.  By his will dated 26 December 1521, he left the bulk of his estate to his widow Elizabeth (''nee'' Pennington), with bequests to his only issue, his illegitimate son, named [[Roger Cholmeley|Roger]].  Cholmeley willed specific items of value to his younger brother, also named Roger.&lt;ref name=Will&gt;National Archives Records: Consistory Court of Canterbury, Wills and Probates 1383-1558 vol. 1 &amp; 2 (J. G. Challenor Smith:) Will and probate for Sir Richard Cholmeley, December 1521 and March 1522, available online at www.nationalarchives.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

Cholmeley's widow, Elizabeth, later married her third husband, Sir William Gascoigne of [[Cardington, Bedfordshire]] (her first husband was Sir Walter Strickland of Sizergh).&lt;ref name=Fiction/&gt;  She died in 1546.  His illegitimate son, [[Roger Cholmeley]], enrolled at [[Lincoln's Inn]] to study law in 1506, eventually becoming Recorder of the City of London (from 1535 to 1545), a [[member of parliament]] and Chief Baron of the Exchequer (from 1545).  He was knighted in 1534.  In May 1552, he was appointed as Chief Justice of the [[King's Bench]].  He was Lord Chief Justice for only a year because [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] would not reappoint him.  Also in 1552, he was imprisoned for six weeks in the [[Tower of London]] and fined for signing [[Lady Jane Grey]]'s instrument of succession as Queen.  He returned to work as a [[barrister]] and was a member of parliament for Middlesex in the early 1550s.  Roger died in 1565, survived by two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;"Cholmley, Sir Roger (c. 1485-1565)", ''The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;  He is possibly best remembered for his endowment to found a free grammar school, [[Highgate School]], at London.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, J. H. ''Cholmley, Sir Roger (c. 1485–1565), Judge'' in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Cholmeley's brother, Roger, had a son whom he named Richard, whose descendants are the Cholmeleys of Roxby, Bramston and [[Whitby]].  This is the line of the current [[Cholmeley baronets|7th Baronet]], Sir Frederick Sebastian Cholmeley of Easton Hall, [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]].  Cholmeley's cousin, Richard Cholmondeley of [[Cholmondeley, Cheshire]], was married to Elizabeth Brereton of [[Malpas, Cheshire|Malpas]], whose brother, [[William Brereton (groom)|William Brereton]], was executed in 1536 on suspicion of being [[Anne Boleyn]]'s lover. That branch of the family's descendants, beginning with [[Hugh Cholmondeley (soldier)|Sir Hugh Cholmondeley]], included the [[Marquess of Cholmondeley|Marquesses and Earls of Cholmondeley]].&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;

==Tomb and family name==
In 1522, after the rebuilding of St. Peter ad Vincula, a tomb was built in the church covered by effigies of Cholmeley and his wife. The monument is one of the oldest in the chapel, where many famous people who were executed at the Tower are buried.  The alabaster effigies lie fenced in ironwork under the central arcade.&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;

However, Cholmeley is not buried in this tomb.  In his will, he requests that he be buried "within the Chapel of our blessed Lady of Barking beside the Tower of London" (now called "All Hallows, Barking") and that if the Masters and Wardens would not agree, then "my body be buried in the Church of the Crutched Friars beside the Tower of London" (now called "St. Olaf's").  All Hallows was almost totally destroyed during the blitz of London during [[World War II]], and so it is not known whether he was buried there or at St. Olaf's.&lt;ref name=Fiction/&gt;  There is some evidence that he may have been buried in one of the tombs of the Cholmondeley, Cheshire branch of his family.&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;

Cholmeley's family can be traced back to the 12th century Robert de Chelmundelegh, second son of William le Belward, who inherited parts of the Barony of Malpas (for which [[Malpas, Cheshire|Malpas]] is named), including Cholmondeley, Cheshire, previously held by Robert Fitzhugh.  Over the centuries, the family name was spelled in many variants as [[middle-English]] developed away from French influences.  Different branches of the family spell the name differently, and Cholmeley's most famous cousins, of Cholmondeley, Cheshire, spell the name "Cholmondeley".&lt;ref&gt;Thornber, Craig. [http://www.thornber.net/cheshire/htmlfiles/cholmond.html "Cholmondeley Castle Gardens: The Cholmondeley family"], Thornber.net, 19 July 2000, accessed 6 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Victorian era|Victorian]] times, Sir Richard's tomb in St. Peter ad Vincula was relocated and had a new name panel fitted.  The panel states that the Lieutenant of the Tower was named Richard "Cholmondeley".  Thus, Gilbert and Sullivan called him "Sir Richard Cholmondeley".  However, Sir Richard's father was John Cholmeley, his grandfather was William Cholmeley, and his brother was Roger Cholmeley.  His will is signed Richard Cholmeley and his illegitimate son was Sir [[Roger Cholmeley]].  After the Cholmondeley branch became the more highly titled branch of the family, Sir Richard Cholmeley, Lieutenant of the Tower, was confused with his cousin, Richard Cholmondeley of Cholmondeley, Cheshire, or one of the five knights named Richard Cholmondeley, Chomondley or Cholmeley living around the same time.&lt;ref name=Fiction/&gt;

'''''Semiotics of the Kitchen''''' is a [[feminism|feminist]] [[parody]] [[video]] and [[performance art|performance piece]] released in 1975 by [[Martha Rosler]]. The video, which runs six minutes, is considered a critique of the commodified versions of traditional women's roles in modern society.

== Scenario ==
Featuring Rosler as a generic [[cooking show]] [[Television presenter|host]], the camera observes as she presents an array of kitchen hand utensils, many of them outdated or strange, and, after identifying them, demonstrates unproductive, sometimes violent, uses for each. It uses a largely static camera and a plain set. 

Letter by letter, Rosler navigates a [[culinary arts|culinary]] lexicon, using a different kitchen implement for each step along the way. She begins with an [[apron]], which she ties around her waist, and, with deadpan humor, journeys through the alphabet, until the last few letters. For these, U, V, W, X,Y, and Z, the implements are dispensed with and Rosler's gestures and body become a signal system themselves. The Z replicates the mark of Zorro, a filmic reference, and at the end of the entire work the artist offers a shrug, somehow defusing the negative reading of the parody. The focus on [[linguistics]] and words is important, since Rosler intended the video to challenge "the familiar system of everyday kitchen meanings -- the securely understood signs of domestic industry and food production."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | title =Semiotics of the Kitchen | publisher =Electronic Arts Intermix | year =2006 | url =http://www.eai.org/eai/tape.jsp?itemID=1545 | accessdate =2006-11-14  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006090705/http://www.eai.org/eai/tape.jsp?itemID=1545 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Meaning ==
A well-known feminist, Rosler remarked about this work that "when the woman speaks, she names her own oppression." The symbolic terminology of the kitchen, she hypothesized, transforms the woman into a sign of the system of food production and harnessed subjectivity. The video subject is an "anti-[[Julia Child]]," Rosler explains; she "replaces the domesticated 'meaning' of tools with a lexicon of rage and frustration."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The work was intended, like all early video, to be shown on a television monitor, and thus it is no accident that some of the gestures represent a tossing or throwing of the imaginary contents of certain implements [[Thinking outside the box|"outside the box"]] of television programming. It is not the production of food in and of itself that is Rosler's target but the taken-for-granted role of happy housewife and selfless producer that the tape intends to spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Food for Thought: A Video Art Sampler | publisher =The Jewish Museum | date = 2006-10-31 | url =http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/onlinex.php?id=152&amp;PHPSESSID=69e501015f90f808e1a2bb69c25d5f72

[[Image:Makonde elephant.jpg|thumb|A Makonde elephant shetani]]
'''Shetani''' (the word is both singular and plural in English, the plural in [[Swahili language|Swahili]] is ''mashetani'') are spirits of East African [[African mythology|mythology and popular belief]].  Mostly malevolent, and found in many different forms and different types with different powers, shetani are a popular subject of carved artwork, especially by the [[Makonde people]] of [[Tanzania]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Kenya]].  Physically, shetani of various types appear as distorted human and animal figures.

There is a contemporary East African shetani cult, and reports of sightings of individual shetani are cyclical, with [[Popo Bawa]] panics having occurred in 1995 in [[Zanzibar]]&lt;ref&gt;"Today the cult of the shetani (meaning a spirit or spirits, the word is singular or plural) is still going strong in Zanzibar and Pemba – a dark undercurrent unseen and unknown by the majority of visitors." ''Zanzibar: The Bradt Travel Guide'', fifth edition, 2006  "The Shetani Of Zanzibar" Gemma Pitcher http://www.zanzibar-travel-guide.com/bradt_guide.asp?bradt=1847&lt;/ref&gt; and 2007 in [[Dar es Salaam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6383833.stm |title= Sex attacks blamed on bat demon |publisher= [[BBC News]] |date=2007-02-21 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influential [[Makonde art]]ist [[George Lilanga]] (1934–2005) gained world renown with his shetani sculptures and paintings. Samaki Likankoa, master carver in Tanzania was the foremost originator of the shetani style in the early 1950s. Mohamed Peera, an Indian art curator was a major patron and influence to many makonde carvers such as Samaki, and played a decisive role in the abstract shetani makonde movement from the early 1950s to 1970s.

==Etymology==

A Swahili word used in various [[East Africa]]n nations to refer to mostly malevolent native pre-Islamic spirits, ''shetani'' (pl. ''mashetani''), is a borrowing from the [[Arabic]], ''[[Shaitan]]'', meaning ''devil'', or, more specifically, ''adversary''.  The word is [[cognate]] with the English word ''[[Satan]]'' which comes ultimately from the same [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] root.&lt;ref&gt;''A host of devils: the history and context of the making of Makonde spirit sculpture,'' Zachary Kingdon, p 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature and types==

There are many types of shetani, with various attributes, and they take on many forms; abstract, animal, [[anthropomorphic]] and combinations thereof.  Whether one-legged or one-armed, [[cyclops|cyclopic]] or with exaggerated orifices and appendages, the essential nature of the shetani is a distorted, [[asymmetrical]] human figure, a common world archetype,&lt;ref&gt;''A host of devils: the history and context of the making of Makonde spirit sculpture,'' Zachary Kingdon, p 132.&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical carving, done in [[ebony]] or [[African blackwood]], might have "one eye, a toothless, open mouth and a body which was bent over backwards with its head facing the wrong way."&lt;ref&gt;''A host of devils: the history and context of the making of Makonde spirit sculpture,'' Zachary Kingdon, p 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various classes of shetani.  Examples include the dangerous ''ukunduka'', which feed through sexual intercourse, and the chameleon shetani, a carnivore with exaggerated habits of the lizard, or the harmless medicinal ''shuluwele'' which gathers herbs for sorcerers.&lt;ref&gt;''Indian Ocean newsletter,'' volumes 5-8, University of Western Australia, Centre for South and Southeast Asian Studies, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some spirits, like the "exceptionally evil"&lt;ref&gt;http://everything2.com/title/Popo+Bawa&lt;/ref&gt; [[Popo Bawa]] ('bat-wing'), associated with "dirt and violent [[sodomy]]" and the smell of burnt [[sulphur]],&lt;ref&gt;''Wind, Life, Health: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives'', Elisabeth Hsu, Chris Low, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; are individuals with horrifying living reputations.&lt;ref&gt;''Zanzibar'', Chris McIntyre, Susan McIntyre, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the BBC in 2001, "Many Zanzibaris are now refusing to sleep in their houses as they believe it only preys on people in the comfort of their own beds. . . . [P]eople believe that it sodomises its victims, most of whom are men."&lt;ref&gt;"Sex-mad 'ghost' scares Zanzibaris", Ally Saleh, Thursday, 19 July 2001, 12:32 GMT 13:32 UK, http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1446733.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shetani cult==

Belief in shetani is a contemporary continuation of pre-Islamic belief.  In addition to the Makonde who carry on a tradition of sculpture, other peoples, such as the [[Segeju]] of Tanzania, who recognize eight or ten tribes of spirits, with each individual having its own name and personality, carry on belief in shetani possession and exorcism.&lt;ref&gt;''Spirit Mediumship and Society in Africa'', John Beattie, John Middleton, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Zanzibar Bradt Travel Guide'', "There is no real way, say the locals, of protecting yourself from the possibility of being haunted or attacked by a shetani. The best thing is simply to keep out of their way and try to make sure they keep out of yours – for example by hanging a piece of paper, inscribed with special Arabic verses, from the ceiling of the house. Almost every home or shop in Zanzibar has one of these brown, mottled scraps, attached to a roof beam by a piece of cotton."&lt;ref&gt;''Zanzibar: The Bradt Travel Guide'', fifth edition, 2006  "The Shetani Of Zanzibar" Gemma Pitcher http://www.zanzibar-travel-guide.com/bradt_guide.asp?bradt=1847&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art and popular culture==

The depiction of shetani continues in the flourishing Makonde sculpture trade, varying from "airport art" knockoffs&lt;ref&gt;"The Authenticity of Makonde Art: A Collector Replies", Leon V. Hirsch, ''African Arts'', Vol. 26, No. 1 (Jan., 1993), p. 10 https://www.jstor.org/pss/3337104&lt;/ref&gt; to fine art found in such venues as the Hamburg Mawingu Collection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.makonde.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

===George Lilanga===

[[Image:George Lilanga insieme all'opera Banana guarda ho l'acquolina in bocca.jpg|thumb|right|George Lilanga with ''We banana anangalia ulimi kiangu unawasha'' ("Banana look to me, I have the mouth-watering")]]
George Lilanga (1934–2005) was a Tanzanian sculptor and artist of the Makonde tribe who lived in [[Dar es Salaam]]. His work was exhibited in international expositions of African contemporaries including Africa Remix in Düsseldorf, Paris, London and Tokyo.

In the 1970s, Lilanga participated in a collective exhibition of African artists in Washington D.C. Of the 280 works presented, about 100 were by Lilanga. It was on this occasion that he was compared with [[Jean Dubuffet]]. Lilanga was considered to have had an influence on the young American graffiti artists; [[Keith Haring]] said in an interview that he had been influenced by Lilanga's art. Lilanga began a long series of exhibitions.  His works had increasing success in Africa, Europe, the US, India and Japan. In the 1980s, he dedicated himself almost exclusively to painting. His shetani were represented two-dimensionally on [[Masonite]] and, later, on Faesite.

The Hamburg Mawingu Collection posthumously published a systematically and thematically complete collection of Lilanga's work, and his work forms the backbone of their collection.

===''Into the Out Of''===

{{Main|Into the Out Of}}

In [[Alan Dean Foster]]'s 1986 horror/fantasy novel, ''Into the Out Of'', elders of the [[Maasai people]] become aware that from the south of them in the [[Ruaha National Park|Ruaha wilderness]] of Tanzania a global crisis is approaching. Malevolent shetani, which originate from a dimensional portal known to the Maasai as the “Out Of” (because all things, such as humans, animals and plants, originally came "out of" it), are finding their way into this world.  In addition to general sabotage, the shetani are fomenting trouble between the superpowers, intent on inciting war.  If not prevented, the barriers between the two dimensions will be permanently breached and uncountable hordes of shetani will overrun the world, enslaving the few humans they do not exterminate.

'''Sonam Dolma Brauen''' (born 1953) is a Tibetan-Swiss [[Contemporary art|contemporary]] painter and sculptor. Her paintings, sculptures and installations are exhibited in Germany, Italy, in the Netherlands, South Korea, Switzerland and in the USA.&lt;ref name="portfotolio.net"/&gt;&lt;ref name="exhibitions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonambrauen.net/#!graduate-collection/crik|title=Exhibitions|publisher=sonambrauen.net|author=|language=|date=|accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==

=== Early life ===
Sonam Dolma was born in [[Kongpo]], Tibet (today [[Kongpo]], [[Gongbo'gyamda County]], [[Nyingchi Prefecture]], [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]], China), the daughter of Kunsang (''Mola'') Wangmo,&lt;ref name="brigitte"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://woman.brigitte.de/reise-genuss/lebensart/yangzom-brauen-1048997/3.html|title=Yangzom Brauen: Essen ein Geschenk|publisher=woman.brigitte.de|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2014-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a former ''[[Bhikkhuni]]'', and Tsering. The family left eastern Tibet when the [[14th Dalai Lama]] refuged in 1959 to [[Dharamshala]] in northern [[India]], crossing the Himalayas on foot. Sonam's father and her younger sister died on the journey.&lt;ref name="landbote20130703"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landbote.ch/de/detail/article/swiss-made-in-hollywood/gnews/99239237/|title=Swiss made in Hollywood|publisher=[[Der Landbote]]'s review of ''[[Who Killed Johnny]]''|author=|language=German|date=2013-07-03|accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dieWelt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/welt_print/vermischtes/article4639479/Drei-Generationen-Tibet.html|title=Drei Generationen Tibet|publisher=[[Die Welt]]|author=Heike Vowinkel|language=German|date=2009-09-27|accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonam grew up in nearby Dharamsala, [[Shimla]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], during the [[Sino-Indian War]]. In autumn 1962, the family had to move to [[Mussoorie]], [[Uttarakhand]], where Sonam took a job waitressing in a Tibetan restaurant. One day she served tea to a Swiss from Bern, an ethnologist, fascinated by the Tibetan culture. They fell in love, and married, and soon after, Martin Brauen took Sonam and her mother Kunsang back with him to [[Switzerland]]: ''I would never have decided for myself to leave if Martin had not come and asked me to marry him''. Settled in Bern, she learnt Swiss-German. Now, everywhere Sonam goes, she brings with her ''tsa tsa'' (small [[Votive offering]]s in the [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism) that her parents carried out from Tibet: ''They make us remember''.&lt;ref name=DailyTelegraph20110307&gt;''[[Eisenvogel]]'' (''Across Many Mountains'') in: {{cite news|last=di Giovanni|first=Janine|title=Across Many Mountains: Escape from Tibet|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/8362276/Across-Many-Mountains-escape-from-Tibet.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2011-03-07|accessdate=2014-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Sonam Dolma Brauen began her training as artist at the Art School Bern and was educated by Arthur Freuler, Leopold Schropp, Mariann Bissegger, and Serge Fausto Sommer. She moved to New York City in 2008, where she lived for four years&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonambrauen.net/#!bio/cnsj|title=Bio &amp; Resume|publisher=sonambrauen.net|author=|language=|date=|accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Manhattan|Manhattan, New York City]]; her studio was located in [[Long Island City]].&lt;ref name="portfotolio.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portfotolio.net/sonamnet|title=Portfolio Sonam Dolma Brauen|publisher=portfotolio.net|author=|language=|date=|accessdate=2014-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thenafter she stayed for a while in the USA, in Korea, Italy and went back to Switzerland.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

=== Personal life ===
Married to the Swiss ethnologist [[Martin Brauen]], Sonam Dolma's daughter [[Yangzom Brauen]] (born in 1981) is a Swiss-Tibetan actress,&lt;ref name="n-tv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n-tv.de/leute/Tibet-Aktivistin-Yangzom-Brauen-article258208.html|title=Auf dem Weg nach Hollywood: Tibet-Aktivistin Yangzom Brauen|publisher=[[n-tv]]|author=Nadia Weigelt|language=German|date=2008-03-27|accessdate=2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; writer (''[[Eisenvogel]]'') and director (''[[Who Killed Johnny]]''). ''Eisenvogel'' ("Iron Bird"), her daughter's 2009 novel, is dedicated to Sonam Dolma's mother Kunsang and her escape from Tibet. The book tells about Yangzom's youth and their common life in exile, and became a bestseller in German-speaking countries. It was later published in English as ''Across Many Mountains''.&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph20110307" /&gt; Sonam's son, Tashi Brauen, is also an artist.&lt;ref name="n-tv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FHNW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhnw.ch/hgk/iku/projekte-veranstaltungen/2010/diplom-bachelor-2010-1/tashi-brauen|title=Diplom Bachelor 2010: Tashi Brauen|publisher=Institut Kunst, Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz (FHNW)|author=|language=German|date=2010|accessdate=2014-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sonam Dolma Brauen's works is ''abstractly and has clear conceptions of her role as an “ethnic painter”'', and is influenced of Buddhist concepts on her work.&lt;ref name="modernartasia2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modernartasia.com/hofer-contemporary-tibetan-art-8/|title=Making Emptiness Visible: Sonam Dolma and Contemporary Tibetan Abstraction|publisher=modern art asia 11/2011|author=Regina Höfer|language=|date=November 2011|accessdate=2014-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her paintings represent the [[Tibetan art#Contemporary Tibetan art|Tibetan]] [[Contemporary art]].

=== Installations ===
After moving to New York City, Brauen began working more with installations ''using materials and objects like used monk robes from Asia, plaster, empty ammunition shells. Provocative works utilize teeth and used ammunition in pieces that comment on contemporary society.'' Her installations express ''ongoing themes that preoccupy her: Machoism and its relation to power, money and war; and the political situation in her home country Tibet''.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

=== Critics ===
The ''art scope magazine'' claims, ''one would think, given Dolma’s origins ... that her art would reflect overtly political or nationalist themes. Or that, being Tibetan-born, she would follow the traditional artistic mores of strict Buddhist iconography. Rather, Dolma’s wall-spanning acrylics and floor-spanning installations tackle a thoroughly rougher territory: the expanse of cultural folly and the crimes of emotion''.&lt;ref name="artscope2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscopemagazine.com/asdyn/index.wr?is=28&amp;a=14|title=SONAM DOLMA: Exploring inner mountains|publisher=art scope magazine November/December 2010 – New England's Culture Magazine|author=Clara Rose Thornton|language=|date=November 2010|accessdate=2014-11-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141124233029/http://www.artscopemagazine.com/asdyn/index.wr?is=28&amp;a=14|archivedate=24 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of '''technology brokering''' is to span multiple, otherwise disconnected industries, to see how existing technologies could be used to create breakthrough innovations in other markets. Technology brokering requires companies to be strong in two areas.&lt;ref name="Hargadon"&gt;Hargadon, A. (2003, November/December). Retooling R&amp;D: Technology brokering and the pursuit of innovation. Ivey Business Journal. Retrieved April 18, 2009, from http://andrewhargadon.com/Release/Hargadon_Ivey_Retooling.pdf{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} As Andrew Hargadon, technology brokering’s founder, summarized: "Firstly, the company must have the ability to bridge distant communities, usually when a company can move easily across a range of different markets they have a better view of how technologies can be used in new ways. Secondly, technology brokering involves creating new markets and industries from innovative combinations of existing technology. These two strengths are difficult to have simultaneously because the strong ties the companies have with customers and supplies in one industry prevent the company from moving easily into other markets and experimenting with new ideas."&lt;ref name="Hargadon"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Yet, when a company is able to combine these two strengths it can result in being the first to experience technological advances.

Technology brokering can teach firms how to effectively shift the focus of traditional R&amp;D teams from trying to invent completely new products to combining previous innovations. New ideas for observation based research pull R&amp;D scientists out of the lab and place them into direct consumer observation to allow them to diagnose problems with products and identify the needs of the customer more accurately.&lt;ref name="Hargadon"/&gt;{{rp|7}} The technology brokering process intertwines with the idea of [[empathic design]], which is basically understanding products from a customers’ point of view and then designing them to fit needs and issues. The advantage of empathic design, especially when combined with technology brokering firms, is that it leads to innovative products that suit the particular problems of the customer. Another perk of empathic design is including marketing and manufacturing people in the product design to get diverse opinions of product success and practicality.

==History==
The first examples of technology brokering can be found as early as 1876 with [[Thomas Edison]] in his [[Menlo Park, New Jersey|Menlo Park]] laboratory. In six years, this lab procured over 400 patents.&lt;ref name="Hargadon"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Menlo Park laboratory was such a successful ‘invention factory’ because Thomas Edison had a firm belief in [[recombinant innovation]]. There were no inventions from Menlo Park that were truly invented from nothing – each one had some basis that was pulled from another field of technology. Edison and his team worked in many different fields in conjunction with many different companies, in addition to working on individual experiments. All of these projects enabled the team to use their knowledge of various fields to be innovative in creating new solutions for different organizations. Because knowledge of technology across differing fields was disconnected, Edison was able to exploit this and create new solutions from areas of past projects.

[[Henry Ford]] is another great inventor in history who understood the power of combining past solutions to create a new one. He is famous for the [[model T]] automobile and the assembly line, but Ford himself stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I invented nothing new. I simply assembled into a car the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work….Had I worked fifty or ten or even five years before, I would have failed. So it is with every new thing. Progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready, and then it is inevitable. To teach that a comparatively few men are responsible for the greatest forward steps of mankind is the worst sort of nonsense."&lt;ref name="Hargadon"/&gt;{{rp|3}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The knowledge of recombinant innovation is alive and thriving today. Companies such as IDEO can easily have their processes compared to Edison’s operations of the Menlo Park laboratory. IDEO is arguably one of the largest and most successful design firms of the current times. Since its founding in 1978, it has created 3,000 new products in over 40 industries.&lt;ref name="Hargadon"/&gt;{{rp|5}} Working amidst several different industries is a large factor of success in technology brokering. The more industries that firms are involved in, the broader their understanding of different technologies will be. CEO of IDEO David Kelley has this to say about working in many different fields:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Working with companies in such dissimilar industries as medical instruments, furniture, toys and computers has given us a broad view of the latest technologies available and has taught us how to do quality product development and how to do it quickly and efficiently."&lt;ref name="Hargadon"/&gt;{{rp|5}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many companies today are restructuring their [[R&amp;D departments]] and they are finding the structure of technology brokering to be very successful and cost-effective for innovation. Not only is technology brokering a business foundation for design firms, it can also be used inside large corporations in order to achieve inter-departmental innovations. Andrew Hargadon was really the first person to coin the term ‘technology brokering’ and advocate to industry its advantages. He did this in the late 1980s, early 1990s, now the concept of technology brokering is fairly common. The Hargadon Group currently advises businesses ranging from [[Fortune 500]] companies to start-ups about how to integrate a technology brokering system into their innovation process.

==Examples==

===Firms===
'''IDEO'''

IDEO is the largest product design consulting firm in the U.S. It focuses on [[mechanical engineering]] and [[industrial design]], and pursues products with high performance, ease of manufacturing, and ease of use. The current CEO and President of IDEO is Tim Brown. The Palo Alto (CA) based company has smaller offices in Boston, Chicago, Grand Rapids, London, San Francisco, New York, and Tokyo.&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"&gt;Hargadon, Andrew; Sutton, Robert I. "Technology brokering and innovation in a product development firm." Administrative Science Quarterly, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1991, IDEO has topped Business Week's list of winners of the annual [[Industrial Design Excellence Awards]], and in 2005, the magazine named IDEO one of the twenty most innovative companies in the world.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;Kelly, Tom. About IDEO. 2005. http://www.tenfacesofinnovation.com/ideo/index.htm (accessed 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

As Tom Kelly stated in The Ten Faces of Innovation, "IDEO creates innovative products, services, spaces , and experiences for companies such as [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Pepsi]]-Cola, and Samsung. IDEO also helps companies build cultures of innovation. Successful designs include Apple mouse, first [[Laptop|laptop computer]], Polaroid I-Zone [[instant camera]], Palm V, soft-handled Gripper toothbrush for [[Oral-B]], and hundreds of other standard-setting designs."&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt;

According to Andrew Hargadon and Robert Sutton’s study of IDEO, "IDEO’s clients, ranging from Fortune 50 companies to start-ups, typically hire the firm to design part or all of a product." "Clients are usually charged for the time and materials required in designing a product but they occasionally work in exchange for a percentage of sales or profits from the finished product. Design projects last from a few weeks to three years, with an average of about a year. Results range from sketches of product concepts to crude working models to complete new product designs."&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;

Most designers at IDEO are 25 to 40 years old, male (about 80 percent), white (about 80 percent), and usually have a B.S. or an M.S. in engineering. Managers have a similar profile but tend to be older (35 to 50 years old). The support staff also has a similar profile to the designers, but with a larger proportion (approximately 50 percent) of women.&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt; Tim Brown believes a good design thinker possesses the following characteristics: empathy integrative thinking, optimism, experimentalism and collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Tim. "Thinking." [[Harvard Business Review]], 2008: 85-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

IDEO’s organizational structure provides great support for technology brokering. The design operations at IDEO force individual designers to face a continual flow of new problems which require engineering solutions. This flow of new problems provides incentives and opportunities for them to develop and exploit a wide-ranging knowledge of potential solutions.&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;

Within the organization, the engineers do not specialize in any single field, but frequently move to a different industry after completing a project for a company. Engineers also often transfer on and off of long-term projects to prevent ‘burn-out’, this allows them to pursue interests in other areas. This movement between teams and projects not only provides designers with a wide range of experiences, it exposes them to the skills and backgrounds of their colleagues.&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;

'''IBO Group'''

[http://ibo-group.co.il IBO Group], with their high Technology [[knowledge transfer]], assist organizations that want to take advantage of the most cutting-edge technology leading by Israel innovation. its founder Itay Tawili has more than 10 years of experience as Information Technology Manager and System Administrator. with his knowledge and IBO [[Business networking|networking]], IBO assist its partners to achieve the exact solution that will suit their needs and issues. by using [[empathic design]] process technique, IBO providing to its decision-Making Executive Leadership partners effective knowledge for them to decide their [[technology strategy]], and achieve their business goals.

'''Menlo Park'''

Thomas Edison was an inventor, a business man, and most importantly an innovator. In 1875 Edison purchased a single model home in New Jersey. This property is referred to as one of his first major innovations; the first industrial research lab, "Menlo Park." This would be the location of over 400 inventions and prove to be a prime example of Thomas Edison using technology brokering to innovate. Edison has stated that he built this laboratory for the; "Rapid and cheap development of an invention." He also promised, "A minor invention every ten days and a major invention every six months."&lt;ref name="Hargadon"/&gt;{{rp|3}} How could Edison make such bold projections? Edison developed four intertwined work practices that helped him be so innovative. They were: capturing good ideas, keeping these ideas alive, imagining new uses for old ideas, and putting promising concepts to test. Using these concepts, which underline the concepts of technology brokering, Edison is credited with 1,093 U.S. patents as well as patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.&lt;ref name="Hargadon"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

One of the reasons Edison was so successful was his ability to surround himself with very knowledgeable people. Edison’s team came from all over the world and they were considered experts in various fields. [[Charles Batchelor]], from England, was Edison’s chief mechanical assistant and helped Edison with many of his inventions. Edison also hired people from Germany, Switzerland, and a number of other European countries.&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;

In an article written by Andrew Hargadon, he states, "Between the years of 1876 to 1881, the lab (Menlo park) produced numerous innovations in high speed, automatic and repeating, telegraphs; telephones; phonographs; generators, voltmeters; light bulbs; and vacuum pumps." Edison’s first major financial success was the quadruplex telegraph. After creating the quadruplex Edison was unsure how to set the price. He originally thought his product could sell for somewhere between $4,000 and $5,000. After he pitched his product to [[Western Union]], Edison was thrilled to see they offered him $10,000 for the telegraph. This financial success allowed Edison to be the founder of the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement, Menlo Park.

It is recognized that Edison understood the concept of technology brokering. And some of his methods were rather elementary. In his own notes it stated, "1st Study the present construction, 2nd Ask for all past experiences…study and read everything you can on the subject."

==Products==
The desire of technology brokers to work with old/discontinued, or already in use products/ideas, has provided an array of fascinating products. For instance, obesity has been a problem for years and many people have gone through endless treatments; however, the craving for food that is high in fat and sugar does not go away. IDEO designed a Crave Aid Patch, similar to the [[Nicotine patch|Nicotine Patch]] used to quit smoking. This patch comes in different flavors of unhealthy food, so that when an individual is craving unhealthy food he/she can wear this patch and fight the hunger.&lt;ref&gt;"Crave Aid Concept," IDEO, http://ideo.com/work/item/crave-aid-concept (accessed April 28, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another excellent example of technology brokering is the telephone. Since it was invented, the telephone has undergone a great number of changes: from residential-only, to being portable in a brief case, to more modernized digital [[Mobile phone|cell phones]] with access to internet and much more. It seemed as though the residential phone would disappear completely due to the technology found in the cellular phones; however, technology brokering was able to bring about a huge change in residential phones. [[Verizon Communications|Verizon communications]] recently introduced the Verizon Hub, a residential phone that allows you to send and receive text-messages, pictures, connect to the internet, and link your cell phone to your Verizon Hub so you can answer your home phone even if not at home.&lt;ref&gt;June, laura . "Engadget ." 23 January 2009. https://www.engadget.com/2009/01/23/verizon-hub-landline-slayer-officially-unveiled/ (accessed 29 April 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The beauty of technology brokering is not inventing totally new products, it is the ability to reimage or recreate a product while using an old idea/product. For example, the Craving Aid Patch was a product originally designed for smokers and in many cases seen as a medical procedure. Nonetheless, exactly the same idea has now been used to create a totally different product using the same technology. Similar to the Craving Aid Patch, which is just an old idea reinvented into a new product, the Verizon Hub, perhaps the most modern residential phone, is based on the very same idea as when it was first invented, in the years of [[Alexander Graham Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;"Crave Aid Patch." 2005.http://ideo.com/work/item/crave-aid-concept (accessed 29 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology Brokering can make an impact on any kind of product regardless of its nature. For example, a bar tap handle could be pretty much anything, a stick or piece of metal, a button, etc. However, with the help of IDEO, Sam Adams was able to innovate its bar tap handles. The totally redesigned Sam Adams tap continues to have a similar shape as the others, but Sam Adams’ has a blue fluorescent cover displaying the Sam Adams brand while giving a sense of the elegance and class behind the Sam Adams brand.&lt;ref&gt;"Sam Adams Bar Tap Handle." 2004.http://ideo.com/work/item/samuel-adams-tap-handle (accessed 29 April 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Light Bulb'''

On December 31, 1879, Edison first displayed his most popular invention. It was the first "practical incandescent, electric lamp. This is a perfect example of Thomas Edison leveraging technology brokering. Edison was not the first person to invent electric light. J.W. Starr filed a patent for an incandescent bulb in 1854. That was 30 years before Edison began working on the light bulb we know today. When Edison first started testing incandescent lamps, the arc light was being used for lighting streets and also for various other applications.

When Edison began testing incandescent lamps he ran into a major problem. The problem was Edison wasn’t sure what material to use for the filament. Most of the material he tried would melt. There was too much oxygen and heat created by the electric current. As a result the filaments would always burn. He used two methods to correct this issue. At first Edison had to find a new material to use. He began by using platinum for his filaments with little success. Eventually he made his filaments by carbonizing [[Bristol board]], which is a type of cardboard. He also acquired the best vacuum pumps available at the time. This would reduce the amount of oxygen inside of the bulbs. These two changes made it possible for Edison to create the light bulb we all use today.

As mentioned above, Edison did not invent the electric light. However, he did leverage technology brokering in order to piece together many different existing technologies to make a better light bulb. As one could assume, Edison was highly appraised for his accomplishments. Many people today believe he was the first person to invent the electric light when truly he was great at leveraging technology brokering.

==Process model==
'''•	Step1: Access'''
According to Andrew Hargadon and Robert Sutton’s study of IDEO, "IDEO has access to dissimilar industries and it enables them to generate product innovations." "Each engineer has a distinct body of technological knowledge from working with IDEO clients, from past technical training and work experience, and from his or her personal interests and backgrounds. The role this diverse knowledge plays in creating new products is evident in a description of how one designer's personal background was the source of new solutions." "IDEO's Methodology Handbook recommends that designers look for opportunities to expand IDEO's network and/or industry knowledge. "IDEO's contact with different technologies comes through the individual engineer’s contact with the industries where those technologies are used."&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;

'''•	Step 2: Acquisition'''
According to Andrew Hargadon and Robert Sutton’s study of IDEO, "Expertise in acquiring new knowledge helps IDEO designers to understand and work with a client's existing technologies." "This ongoing process of learning from clients started in IDEO's early days and remains part of all projects." "IDEO's Methodology Handbook states that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As consultants we need to quickly become experts in the client's product area. We want to acclimate ourselves to the market, the buzz words, the competition. We need to orient ourselves to the major pitfalls, alternatives, and opportunities."&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"IDEO engineers also acquire knowledge by studying an industry's existing products because they serve as records of the technologies in that industry."&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;

'''•	Step 3: Storage'''
According to Andrew Hargadon and Robert Sutton’s study of IDEO, there are "two types of routines at IDEO for storing potential technological solutions." Routines for storing specific knowledge "place potential solutions in the memories of individual designers and objects and products that designers collected from their previous work." Routines for maintaining and refreshing that knowledge include "displaying objects where other designers can see them and constant conversations that designers have about who has what design knowledge."&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;
"Upper-level managers often direct designers to individuals with relevant expertise by knowing who had worked previously on what projects."&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;

'''•	Step 4: Retrieval'''
According to Andrew Hargadon and Robert Sutton’s study of IDEO, "at IDEO, retrieval entails bringing stored knowledge of potentially valuable technological solutions to bear on the design problems of current projects." IDEO designers retrieve technological solutions through "analogical thinking" and through "established routines for sharing the problems of current design projects with other designers in the organization who have relevant and potentially valuable knowledge." "Potential solutions are drawn from IDEO's organizational memory at brainstorming sessions and company-wide Monday morning meetings." "Retrieval also occurs during informal conversations that follow meetings or e-mails", which are facilitated by IDEO's "open office plan" and encounters with other designers.&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;

{{Literature}}
'''''The Gettysburg Review''''' is a quarterly literary magazine featuring [[short stories]], [[poetry]], [[essays]] and reviews. Work appearing in the magazine often is reprinted in "best-of" anthologies and receives awards. 

The little magazine "is recognized as one of the country’s premier journals," according to a description at the Web site of the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/press/2007/periodically2007.cfm  "Literary Magazine Editors Introducing Emerging Writers at The New York Public Library"] New York Public Library Web site (the description does, however appear to have come from the magazine itself; nevertheless, it was approved for publishing at the respected library's Web site), Retrieved June 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 ''[[U.S. News]]'' guide to the best colleges described the review as "recognized as one of the country's best literary journals."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drmiss_3268_brief.php] Web page titled "America's Best Colleges 2007 / Gettysburg College", (given the similarity in wording, the phrase, slightly reworded, may have come from some promotional material from the college; nevertheless, the magazine's editors endorsed it by publishing it), Retrieved June 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Web page of the English Department of the University of Wisconsin Colleges, the Gettysburg Review is considered a "major literary journal in the U.S."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwc.edu/uwc/depts/english/Links/links.htm Literature and Writing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603002824/http://www.uwc.edu/uwc/depts/english/Links/links.htm |date=2007-06-03 }} University of Wisconsin Colleges Web site, Retrieved June 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 50 Literary Magazine|url=http://www.everywritersresource.com/topliterarymagazines.html|work=EWR|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the magazine is published by [[Gettysburg College]] in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]]. Its quarterly issues come out in January, April, July, and October.&lt;ref name=mast&gt;[http://public.gettysburg.edu/academics/gettysburg_review/masthead.html "Masthead"] ''The Gettysburgh Review'', Retrieved February 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  

The magazine does not print material which has been published elsewhere. Along with fresh and new short stories, it is open to publishing original poetry, whether short or long,  and excerpts from novels. The magazine will occasionally serialize longer fictional works over more than one issue. "Essays can be on virtually any subject, so long as it is treated in a literary fashion &amp;mdash; gracefully and in depth," according to the magazine's Web site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.gettysburg.edu/academics/gettysburg_review/sbmssns.html Submissions] ''The Gettysburg Review'' Web site, Retrieved February 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guide-fic&gt;[http://www.gettysburgreview.com/submissions/guidelines/  Guidelines - Fiction]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Gettysburg Review'' is one of the most frequent sources of material for ''[[The Best American Essays]]'', ''[[The Best American Poetry]]'', and ''[[The Best American Short Stories]]'' series. Other anthologies that have reprinted work originally published in the magazine: ''The Pushcart Prize: Best of the Small Presses'', ''The Best Creative Nonfiction'', ''The Best American Mystery Stories'', ''Best New American Voices'', ''Best New Poets'', ''New Stories from the South'', and ''Prize Stories: The O. Henry Awards''. Other work has been reprinted in publications such as ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers]]'' and the ''UTNE Reader.''&lt;ref name=new&gt;[http://newpages.com/magazineguide/gettysburg_review.htm Gettysburg Review] New Pages, Retrieved February 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The periodical has won awards including the Best New Journal award, four Best Journal Design awards from the Council of Editors of Learned Journals, and a PEN/Nora Magid Award for Excellence in Editing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettysburg.edu/uniquely_gettysburg/ Uniquely Gettysburg] Gettysburg College Web site, Retrieved February 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1994 review of the magazine, Ron Tanner wrote that the stories in the 1993 issues were widely varied in style, but "are clearly in the mainstream of contemporary American fiction &amp;mdash; you will not find 'experimental' work in ''The Gettysburg Review''." 

He also found the stories have a common "concern for character, and an examination of the emotional and psychological distance one might travel when faced with a problem.  [...] each compels the character to make a decision, to make an effort, to make a move. Consequently, things happen in these stories. Which is to say that we end in a place very different from the story's beginning. In no resolution of a ''Gettysburg'' story, however, do we find ourselves living Happily Ever After. Life is more complicated than that, these writers assert."&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Ron.

The quarterly gets about 6,000 submissions per year and does not solicit work except for occasional reviews. "[W]e work hard not to have a regular stable of writers or favored persons of any kind," according to founding editor Peter Stitt. "We are most proud of publishing writers who have never before appeared in a nationally-circulated journal. But we do not actively search through the slush pile for anything but good writing."&lt;ref name=emerging&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050214092444/http://www.breaktech.net/EmergingWritersForum/View_Interview.aspx?id=115 "Interview with LitJournals / Conducted by Dan Wickett on January 19, 2005"] Emerging Writers Forum, Retrieved June 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine is supported financially by Gettysburg College, for the most part, although it also receives grants from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts and the NEA, along with some revenue from subscriptions.&lt;ref name=emerging/&gt;

'''''The Hebrew Hammer''''' is a 2003 American [[comedy film]] written and directed by Jonathan Kesselman. It stars [[Adam Goldberg]], [[Judy Greer]], [[Andy Dick]], [[Mario Van Peebles]], and [[Peter Coyote]]. The plot concerns a [[Jewish]] [[blaxploitation]] crime fighter known as the Hebrew Hammer who must save [[Hanukkah]] from the evil son of [[Santa Claus]], who wants to destroy Hanukkah and [[Kwanzaa]] and make everyone celebrate [[Christmas]].

The film parodies blaxploitation films, and features [[Melvin Van Peebles]] in a cameo as "[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song|Sweetback]]".

==Plot==
The film begins with a flashback to a young Mordechai Jefferson Carver. At school, Mordechai is tormented by his fellow students and his teacher for being a Jewish child in a public school predominantly attended by Christians, and for celebrating Hanukkah while everyone else celebrates Christmas. He feels further alienated as he walks through his neighborhood and sees a seemingly endless number of Christmas decorations and window displays celebrating the holiday and announcing that Jews aren't welcome. As he lies down on the sidewalk in front of a store saying "Jews Welcome (for about 5 minutes)" and spins his [[dreidel]] to cheer himself up, Santa Claus walks by and crushes the toy under his foot, then gives Mordechai the [[middle finger|finger]].

The scene then changes to the present with Mordechai as the Hebrew Hammer, a certified [[Male circumcision|circumcised]] [[Detective|dick]] who has dedicated his life to defending Jews. His snappy dress (a cross between that of a pimp and a [[Hasidic Jew]]) and tough-guy demeanor have made him a local hero within the Jewish community. Jews and African-Americans have enjoyed a tenuous peace with the White Christians over the previous few decades, because the current Santa (the son of the cruel Santa who stomped Mordechai's dreidel years earlier) has pursued a policy of inclusion and tolerance.  This Santa is murdered and replaced by his son, Damian, who seeks to destroy Hanukkah and Kwanzaa thus reserving December for Christmas alone. Mordechai is reluctantly recruited to stop Damian, gaining allies along the way, including love interest and daughter of the Chief of the Jewish Justice League Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal and the Kwanzaa Liberation Front's leader Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim.

The fight takes them to exotic locales such as [[Israel]], [[K-Mart]], the Jewish Atomic Clock outside [[Jerusalem]] and the final battle at the [[North Pole]].

==Controversy==
''The Hebrew Hammer'' parodies many common [[stereotype]]s about Jews. During filming, the movie came to the attention of the [[Anti-Defamation League]], which were concerned that it might promote unfavorable images of Jews; the film happens to include a direct parody of the ADL as members of the fictional Jewish Justice League. After viewing the film, Warren Katz of the ADL brought legal action against the producers of the film, but lost in a summary ruling handed down by the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]]. The film also drew criticism from some Christian groups, who argued that the film portrayed most Christians as being anti-Semitic and intolerant. 

Many scenes were shot in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]], [[Brooklyn]], which has a large community of Hasidic Jews. Filmmakers were initially concerned that members of the Hasidic community might protest the movie, as they did with the 1998 film ''[[A Price Above Rubies]]'', and shut down filming. Reaction of the Hasidim in Borough Park was mixed, however. No organized protest was pursued, and some residents of the neighborhood actually agreed to appear as extras in the film.

==Reception==
The film received a rating of 52% on aggregate review site [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|hebrew_hammer|The Hebrew Hammer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
In 2017, plans for a sequel titled ''The Hebrew Hammer Vs. Hitler''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2568284/|title=The Hebrew Hammer vs. Hitler}}&lt;/ref&gt; were announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/TheHebrewHammerII|title=The Hebrew Hammer II|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/life/film/1.824074|title=The Hebrew Hammer Is Set to Fight His Biggest Foes Yet - Hitler and anti-Semitism|last=|date=|website=Haaretz|publisher=|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequel will be funded in part by crowd funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://app.microventures.com/crowdfunding/hebrew-hammer-2|title=MicroVentures - The Hebrew Hammer Vs.

"'''The Jolly Roger'''" is the seventeenth episode of the [[Once Upon a Time (season 3)|third season]] of the American fantasy drama series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', and the show's 61st episode overall, which aired on April 13, 2014.

In this episode, Ariel pleads with Hook to search for Eric, whom she believes disappeared upon his return to Storybrooke, as [[Emma Swan]] receives a lesson on how to defeat Zelena from Regina, meanwhile, Mary Margaret and David try to convince Henry that they are not as boring as Henry thinks. Meanwhile, back in the Enchanted Forest, Ariel believes that Hook kidnapped Eric, but when Hook's ship disappears, the two start their search to find out what happened.

==Plot==

===Opening Sequence===
David's pickup truck is featured driving in the forest.

===In the Characters' Past===
In the Enchanted Forest, a knight stands in the road blocking two other knights from passing and demands that they leave the treasure. The knights do not take him seriously but all of a sudden, flaming arrows light up all around the 2 knights and they retreat. It turns out that the knight who orchestrated this ambush is Hook, with help from Smee and two of his crew members, and all the flaming arrows were held by dummies.  As they arrive to a tavern to celebrate their latest steal, Hook's men get him a bar girl, but outside he turns her down, then he gets knocked out by Ariel, who then orders Hook to his feet and he tells her she's got the wrong pirate. Ariel tells Hook that Eric was taken aboard the Jolly Roger, and when Hook asks her who's the captain of his ship now, Ariel shows Hook a knife with carved initials, which Hook recognizes as those belonging to Blackbeard. Hook laments that he hasn't been the same since he got back to the Enchanted Forest because he hasn't used his ship. However, Hook is left with no choice but to have Ariel come along with him and Smee. As they trek across the forest, Hook tells Ariel that she may not find Eric, but she tells him she's heard stories of Hook helping Snow White reunite with her family in Neverland, and she says there's nothing wrong with being good, but Hook says (reluctantly) he's a pirate and that he always will be one.

As they reach the docks next to the Jolly Roger, Hook sees one of Blackbeard's men and knocks him out, when all of a sudden his adversary Blackbeard shows up to give him a message: if Hook wants his ship, he'll have to fight for it. Hook accepts and a sword fight battle commences, but just as Hook is about to kill Blackbeard, Ariel tells Hook they need to know where Eric is first, because he's not on board. It turns out that Blackbeard has left Eric stranded on a deserted island, and offers Hook a deal in which he'll tell him where Eric is if Hook gives up the Jolly Roger, or else Eric will die. Ariel tries to talk Hook into saving Eric and giving up the Jolly Roger, but he tells her love brings pain and that he's doing her a favor. As Hook cuts Blackbeard loose and tosses him overboard, Ariel slaps Hook and tells him he's selfish and heartless, and that's what will bring him endless torment. Then, she jumps off the plank into the water to find Eric.

===In Storybrooke===
In David and Mary Margaret's loft, [[Emma Swan]] helps David put a crib together, and along with Regina and Mary Margaret, Zelena has become the main subject of conversation as Regina has put a protection spell over the loft. Emma tells Regina she wants her to teach her magic so they can defeat Zelena. David then offers to watch Henry, but Emma says Henry doesn't think they're fun, as he thinks Hook is better to be around with. At the docks, a homesick Smee tells Hook he and the men miss him, but when he asks Hook what happened to the Jolly Roger, Hook tells him all he needs to know is the ship's not here and has no intention of leaving Storybrooke. As Emma walks up with Henry, Hook flirts with Emma and tells her he thinks it's good she's going to be learning about magic, which she says will be enough to defeat Zelena, then she's done, but Hook tells her she can't pretend this never happened since she can't go back to her old life, saying it didn't work for him. At the same time, Mary Margaret and David walk on the beach and notice a group gathered around a woman who just washed up on shore, which they discover is Ariel. When Mary Margaret and David ask Ariel what happened to her, she tells them that Eric's missing and she's been looking for him, adding that she has no memories of the missing year. David suggests that Hook might know what happened to Eric. Later on at Granny's diner, Hook teaches Henry how to roll dice, when David comes in and "introduces" Ariel to him, but when she asks Hook if he saw Eric during the missing year, he lies to her, saying that he never heard of him, and as the others (David, Mary Margaret and Ariel) talk about finding him in Storybrooke, Hook refuses to help (believing that Eric is dead), but David wants Hook to help Ariel anyway while he and Mary Margaret watch over Henry.

At Regina's vault, Regina warns Emma not to touch anything as they talk about Hook watching Henry and Hook flirting at Emma all the time. Regina then uses her magic to send Emma to a rope bridge across a deep chasm, where Regina tells Emma that she's going to push her instincts, and as the boards start flying off the bridge, Regina says Emma has to reach into her gut and she can either stop it or die. Emma falls off the bridge, when she suddenly levitates herself back up to the top of the gorge. Meanwhile, Mary Margaret and David talk about how to be more fun and cool around Henry, and David later proceeds to teach Henry how to drive in his truck, as Henry almost causes an accident as he almost hits a car and hits a mailbox.

Ariel and Hook pay a visit to Gold's shop and talk to Belle, where Hook finds his spyglass and notices a clasp that belongs to Eric. After a hopeful Ariel hugs Hook, Belle then pours a magical liquid infused with a locator spell onto Eric's cloak, which will help bring them closer to Eric. At the docks, the two use Eric's cloak as it floats through the air to the water, only to disappear under the surface, which disappoints Ariel, who starts to cry as she mourns her loss, and Hook tells her he's sorry. Ariel thanks Hook for helping find Eric's cloak, saying that she wishes she knew how it ended and that Hook has a true heart, adding that she will always be grateful to him. But as Hook runs up to Ariel he reveals to her they met in the missing year and explains what happened to Eric, saying that he was too ashamed to tell her before, he apologizes. Ariel calls Hook a coward and a monster because he traded a man's life for his ship. Then, when Hook begs for redemption, Ariel makes Hook swear that he still believes in love, and that he still loves the woman who broke his heart. Unfortunately, after admitting to his confession by swearing on Emma Swan's name, Ariel blows green powder onto Hook's lips and then transforms into Zelena, who had used her disguise as Ariel, because she knew that Hook's guilt from the day he chose the Jolly Roger over Eric would continue to haunt him. Zelena also cursed his kiss, meaning the next time he kisses Emma, her magic will disappear, leaving her powerless to stop Zelena. Since Hook realizes Zelena is unable to kill Emma, Zelena warns him that unless he kisses Emma to have her magic removed, she'll continue to threaten Emma's family and friends, by using Rumplestiltskin's dagger to kill them. Later that evening, Hook visits the loft, where he lies and tells Emma and Regina that Ariel had left to find Eric. Using a "magic mirror" spell, Emma watches the real Ariel and Eric embracing on a beach, happy and safe. As David, Mary Margaret and Henry return to the loft, Henry tells the others that he had a lot of fun with the couple. As Hook leaves, Emma tells him that even if he won't tell her what happened in the past year she's tired of living in the past. And as he sees the family having dinner at Granny's later on, Hook is troubled that he couldn't tell Emma the truth, because he is torn over Zelena's threat to hurt Emma's loved ones if he doesn't, and the knowledge of what will happen if he kissed her.

===Critical reception===
The episode was met with positive reviews.

Hillary Busis of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave it a great review: ""The Jolly Roger" was an appropriately exciting hour of television—complete with the sort of confounding, frustrating final twist that ''Once'' should consider having trademarked. All that, plus the return of JoAnna Garcia Swisher's delightfully daffy Ariel?&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/once-upon-a-time-season-3-episode-17/ "'Once Upon a Time' recap: Boat Show"] from [[Entertainment Weekly]] (April 13, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Christine Orlado of ''TV Fanatic'' gave the episode 4.4 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref name="TV Fanatic"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2014/04/once-upon-a-time-review-a-tortured-hero/|title=Once Upon a Time Review: A Tortured Hero|work=TV Fanatic|date=April 13, 2014|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amy Ratcliffe of IGN gave it an 8.5, saying that "This week's ''Once'' focused on Hook, and things got awfully exciting - in a good way."&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/14/once-upon-a-time-the-jolly-roger-review|title=ONCE UPON A TIME: "ONCE A PIRATE..."|work=IGN|last=Ratcliffe|first=Amy|date=April 14, 2014|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gwen Ihnat of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a B, noting that "Hook has been one of the more delightful character reinventions on ''Once Upon A Time''. Turning the classic permed villain into a swaggery anti-hero, now a tortured romantic, is one of the most successful character transformations this show has taken on. The episode title “The Jolly Roger” refers to Hook’s efforts to get his boat back, his true love, but really the vessel is just a stand-in for his actual true love, Emma, who—due to yet another unfortunate curse!—seems farther away from him than ever by the end of the episode." &lt;ref name="AVClub"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/once-upon-time-jolly-roger-203396|title=ONCE UPON A TIME: "The Jolly Roger" |work=The A.V.

[[Edward Burne-Jones]] took twelve years to complete ''The Mill'', starting work in 1870&lt;ref name=Bade2011/&gt; and completing it in 1882.&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web|title=Study of a Dancing Woman for 'The Mill' c.1870–82|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/burne-jones-study-of-a-dancing-woman-for-the-mill-n03981|website=tate.org.uk|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after its completion, the painting was displayed at an exhibition at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]].&lt;ref name="Wahl2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kimberly Wahl|title=Dressed As in a Painting: Women and British Aestheticism in an Age of Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UK-3AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84|year=2013|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-61168-415-5|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Mill'' was inspired by ''[[The Allegory of Good and Bad Government]]'', a [[mural]] painted by [[Italian Renaissance]] artist [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] between 1338 and 1340.&lt;ref name=leicester&gt;{{cite web|title=Portrait of Marie Spartali, Mrs W.

==Painting==
''The Mill'' is an [[oil on canvas]] painting. It is {{convert|91|cm|in}} in height, and {{convert|197|cm|in}} in width.&lt;ref name="Bade2011"/&gt;

''The Mill'' is a vague and mysterious painting with no particular meaning.&lt;ref name=Wahl2013/&gt; It incorporates styles from the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and the Renaissance.&lt;ref name=vam/&gt; In the painting, three women wearing simple, Renaissance-style [[aesthetic]] dresses&lt;ref name=Wahl2013/&gt; are dancing in a garden on a summer evening. On the right of the dancing women, a musician of an indiscernible gender is standing under a [[loggia]].&lt;ref name=Bade2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=vam/&gt; A [[mill pond]] can be seen behind the women.&lt;ref name=vam/&gt; On the other side of the pond, there are several nude men, who are presumably swimming. In the background is an unspecific landscape consisting of various designs and types of architecture.&lt;ref name=Bade2011/&gt;

The dancing women in the painting were modelled upon women known to Burne-Jones personally: from left to right, [[Aglaia Coronio]], [[Marie Spartali Stillman|Marie Stillman]], and [[Maria Zambaco]].&lt;ref name=MacCarthy&gt;{{cite book | title = The Last Pre-Raphaelite: Edward Burne-Jones and the Victorian Imagination | publisher = Harvard University Press | date = Mar 5, 2012 | pages = 203–204 | ISBN = 9780674065796 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YA-_nl_N-a4C&amp;pg=PA204&amp;l}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aglaia was the daughter of [[Alexander Constantine Ionides|Constantine Ionides]], who, like Burne-Jones, was interested in art. Marie was a painter,&lt;ref name=Wahl2013/&gt; and Maria was Ionides' granddaughter.&lt;ref name=vam/&gt; At the time, Maria was Burne-Jones' [[mistress (lover)|mistress]].&lt;ref name=Wahl2013/&gt;

==Ownership==
Constantine Ionides bought the painting on 21 April 1882 for [[pound sterling|£]]905.&lt;ref name=vam&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mill: Girls Dancing to Music by a River|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O14964/the-mill-girls-dancing-to-oil-painting-burne-jones-edward/|website=collections.vam.ac.uk|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently housed in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], in London.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt;

'''Al-Iqtisād fī al-iʿtiqad''' ({{Lang-ar|الاقتصاد في الاعتقاد}}), or '''The Moderation in Belief''' is a major theological work by Abū Ḥāmid Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad [[al-Ghazali]].&lt;ref name="ucp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo16220536.html|title=Al-Ghazali’s "Moderation in Belief" |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Hourani]] indicated that the ''Iqtisad'' and ''[[Mizan al-amal]]'' were completed before or during
Ghazali's crisis of faith. It led him to abandon his notorious post at the [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad|Niẓamiyya school]] in [[Baghdad]] and enter the path of [[Tasawwuf]]. In it, he offers what scholars consider as the best defence of the [[Ash'arite]] school of Islamic theology. He also expressed strong reservations about a theology based on [[taqlid]] and marked by [[polemics]]. In this book, Ghazali makes an attempt to respond to the extreme literalists and the [[Muʿtazilites]]. It is the balance between reason and revelation that led to the title of book ''The Moderation in Belief''.&lt;ref name="ucp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ghazali.org/articles/gz-iranica.htm|title=Al-Ghazali from Encyclopedia Iranica|website=www.ghazali.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ghazali.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ghazali.org/books/Iqtisad%20Dissertation%20final.pdf |title=Al-ghazālī on Divine Essence: A Translation from The Iqtiṣād Fī Al-iʿtiqad with Notes and Commentary |publisher=ghazali.org |accessdate=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
Ghazali begins the book with praise for God and importance of [[revelation]]. On one hand, he says,
a person who is not guided by reason will misunderstand the revelation while on the
other hand a [[rationalist]] may exceed the limits leading to rejection of the plain meaning of
revelation. The right course, he says, is to reconcile reason with revelation, one that puts reason at the service of understanding and then interprets the revelation. Reason, together
with the Revelation, is light upon light as mentioned in [[Quran]] chapter 24, verse 35.
Next comes an explanatory chapter with its four introductions and four main sections. Ghazali's
main topic throughout is in praise of God, depicting it as a work of theology.&lt;ref name="ghazali.org"/&gt;

== Translations ==
A translation into English of the first sections was published as a dissertation by Dennis Morgan Davis Jr. in 2005.&lt;ref name="ghazali.org"/&gt;

The first complete English-language edition of was made by Aladdin M. Yaqub, and published by the University of Chicago Press in 2013.&lt;ref name="ucp" /&gt;

'''''The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss''''' ({{ISBN|0-679-43448-8}}) is a collection of [[visual art]] created by Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as [[Dr. Seuss]]. It was published in 1995, after Geisel's death, by [[Random House]] of [[New York City|New York]].

==Contents of the book==

===Visual art===
The bulk of this collection consists of [[painting]] and [[drawing]]. It does, however, include photographs of many [[sculpture]]s created by Geisel. Both forms of art display the characteristic [[artistic|style]] and form that can be seen in all of his [[children's books]].

====Sculpture====
All of Dr. Seuss's sculptures display the same themes, which are [[taxidermy]] and [[trophy hunting]]. Each sculpture takes the form of an imaginary and fantastic creature displayed on a wood mount in the style of a hunting [[trophy]]. Most of his pieces in this category make use of authentic animal parts.

===Introduction/foreword===
In addition to visual art, ''Secret Art'' provides more personal insight into the life of Theodor Geisel. The book opens with a very short introductory letter by Geisel's widow, [[Audrey Geisel]], titled "A Personal Note About Theodor Seuss Geisel", as well as an introduction by [[Maurice Sendak]], both of which relate anecdotal tales of Geisel's work ethic and artistic vision.

==Media==
Dr. Seuss used a wide variety of [[recording medium|media]] in his art. In keeping with the [[postmodernism|post-modernist]] tradition, Seuss is very experimental with his media; he even uses a hinged window frame and screen as a frame for one of his oil paintings.

===Paintings and drawings===
Theodor Seuss Geisel's favored medium is [[watercolor]], usually either on [[bristol board|bristol]] or [[illustration]] board. He also makes ample use of [[ink]] or [[pen]], [[oil paint|oil]], and [[acrylic paint|acrylic]]. This selection of media helps to expand his distinctive style.

===Sculpture===
The most distinct aspect of Geisel's sculpture is his choice of medium. As mentioned above, all of his sculptures take the form of hunting-lodge trophies in the forms of surreal or fantasy animals. As if to enhance this effect, Dr. Seuss uses real parts of dead animals and animal [[by-product]]s. Each sculpture is hung on a plain wood mount.

==Classification and analysis==
Many have tried to classify Dr. Seuss's artwork, but there is no true consensus among [[art criticism|critics]] on which [[art movement|school of art]] or movement he belongs to.

Although he was no longer working at the time the terms were coined, he can probably be best defined as a combination of early forms of [[maximalism]] and [[cute formalism]]. This is evident not only in the visual [[aesthetic]] of his work, but also in his work ethic. In the maximalist tradition, his work is very bright, sensual, visually rich, and extremely detailed. He was also very conscientious, and his pieces are all very [[formalism (art)|formalistic]] and work-extensive. All of his pieces also display a childish and playful nature, with a touch of femininity and a sense of ironic politeness, which leads to the assertion that he was a preemptive cute formalist. This observation is particularly interesting because of the evident [[Oriental]] influence on Geisel's art, and both of these movements are centered in Eastern [[Asia]]n culture (Chinese and [[Japan]]ese, respectively).

Some have labeled Seuss's art as [[expressionism|expressionist]], but critics of this argument claim that his working style and ethics were not in-line with those of expressionism. Expressionism is usually defined as the exaggeration or over-emphasis of shapes, forms, and colors to heighten emotional reaction. While Dr. Seuss's art is clearly very exaggerated and emotional, many critics do not believe it was created with the deliberate attempt at emotional "shock value" they see as being characteristic of expressionism.

Neither of these arguments has much critical support, but then, neither do many other arguments concerning the classification of Theodor Seuss Geisel; in fact, he died before some of these terms were even coined. His works were quickly acquired by American [[pop art]] galleries, and some (but very few) critics consider it [[kitsch]]. Perhaps the safest classification is just as [[transgressive art]], or even just the broader umbrella term of [[postmodernism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

'''''The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time: A Proposal in Natural Philosophy''''' is a non-fiction book by the American theoretical physicist [[Lee Smolin]] and the Brazilian philosopher [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. The book was initially published by [[Cambridge University Press]] on December 8, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Singular-Universe-Reality-Time/dp/1107074061|publisher=[[amazon.com]]|title = The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time: A Proposal in Natural Philosophy Hardcover – December 8, 2014 - by Roberto Mangabeira Unger (Author), Lee Smolin (Author)|accessdate=2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22505318-the-singular-universe-and-the-reality-of-time?from_search=true&amp;search_version=service|publisher=[[goodreads.com]]|title=The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time: A Proposal in Natural Philosophy Hardcover by Roberto Mangabeira Unger and Lee Smolin |accessdate=2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/physics/history-philosophy-and-foundations-physics/singular-universe-and-reality-time-proposal-natural-philosophy?format=HB|publisher=[[cambridge.org]]|title=The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time |accessdate=2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book discusses a number of [[philosophy of time|philosophical]] and physical ideas on the true role of time in the Universe. The text is roughly divided into two halves, the first one written by Unger, and the second by Smolin, both developing the same themes in different ways, with Smolin being more focused on the physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=7552|publisher=[[math.columbia.edu]]|title=The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time |accessdate=2015-06-25|date=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reviews ==
{{quote|You might expect a book co-authored by Smolin and Unger to be an exchange about science and human values—something, perhaps, in the region of the 1930 dialogue between Einstein and the polymath [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. But ''The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time'' is not that kind of thing: it is a big and daunting book, harder to read than recent works by either author. The first section, by Unger, includes among other things an exploration of the global, irreversible and continuous attributes of time, followed by an analysis of proto-ontological assumptions. The second section, by Smolin, contains an approach to solving the meta-law dilemma, outlining linear cyclic models, branching models and branching cyclic cosmologies before it dives into [[cosmological natural selection]], pluralistic cosmological scenarios and the principle of precedence.}}

{{quote|I found the long section by Unger rather hard going and not very rewarding... Smolin gives a discussion of mathematics itself which I think few mathematicians would recognize}}
- [[Peter Woit]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=7552&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quotes ==

-I. II. P. 53

{{quote|A revisionist reading of the history of physics would seek inspiration for a historical way of thinking about the universe in the line that begins in thermodynamics before Maxwell, continues in thermodynamics after him, and leads to the contemporary study of cosmological difficulties such as the so-called horizon and flatness problems.}}

- I. I. P. 9

{{quote| According to this view, the laws, symmetries, and supposed constants change together with the phenomena. Causal connections are, on this view, a primitive feature of nature.}} 

- I. IV. P. 193

{{quote|Third, and most importantly, general relativity must be reformulated without the addition of the Riemannian spacetime conception, the disposition to spatialize time, or the block-universe view, none of which are vindicated by the empirical and experimental evidence adduced in favor of general relativity. The metaphysical gloss must be lifted from the empirical theory, with the result of suggesting a redirection of the agenda of cosmology.}}

- I. III. P. 100

{{quote|Two parts of nature belong to the same universe if they share any event in their causal past, even if they have subsequently become causally disjoint. It is the network of causal relations viewed backward into the past that determines the scope of causal communion and thus the separate existence of a universe.}}

- I. VI. P. 345

{{quote|What results is a view that recognizes the unmatched powers and the unique perspective of mathematics. It nevertheless repudiates the Pythagorean claim, made on behalf of mathematics for at least twenty-six hundred years, that mathematical insight represents a shortcut to eternal truth about incorruptible objects. It sees mathematical reasoning as inquiry into the world -- the only world that there is, the world of time and fuzzy distinction -- only at one step of remove.}}

- II. IV. P. 420

{{quote|A global preferred time would have to be relational, in that it would be determined by the dynamics and state of the universe as a whole. It would thus not be determinable in terms of information local to any observer. Such a relational local time could then be consistent with the relativity of simultaneity holding locally in regions of spacetime. There is a precedent for such a relational, dynamically determined global time in the Barbour-Bertotti model. This raises the question of whether general relativity can be formulated as a theory with a preferred dynamically determined global time. The answer is yes; this is shown by the existence of a formulation of general relativity as a theory defined on a fixed three-surface which evolves in a global time coordinate. This formulation, called shape dynamics, shares with general relativity diffeomorphism invariance on the three-dimensional spacelike surfaces but replaces the many-fingered time invariance on the three-dimensional spacelike surfaces with a new local gauge invariance which is invariant under local three-dimensional conformal transformations. These transformations however are restricted to preserve the volume of the universe. The spatial volume then becomes an observable and can be used as a time parameter.}}

- P. xvi
{{quote|Only when we understand becoming from the perspective of relational time can we subject it to a dynamics that is internal to the universe. Only then can we lay it open to explanation by the methods of science.}}

- I. II. P. 74

{{quote|We must reestablish the indispensable link, in social and historical study, between insight into the actual and exploration of the adjacent possible. On this basis, we must exercise the prerogative of the programmatic imagination: the vision of alternatives, connected by intermediate steps to the here and now, especially alternative institutional forms of democracy, markets, and free civil societies.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6646">'''THINK AGAIN''' is an artist-activist collaborative founded in 1997 by David John Attyah (b. Los Angeles) and [[S.A. Bachman]] (b. Columbus, Ohio.) They produce interventions that recruit art-making in the service of public address. Their work — digital murals, billboards and wallscapes, exterior projections, and viral poster campaigns — links the global to the local and combines cultural theory, sociological research, and activism to create a visual language for engaging civic dialogue. THINK AGAIN projects have explored a diverse range of issues including  queer liberation; the ways capitalism and misogyny conspire to jeopardize women and the outnumbered; the logic of militarization; international labor and the treatment of immigrants; and gentrification and displacement.

Many of its projects privilege face-to-face interactions: handing out postcards at Pride parades, parking mobile billboards in front of City Halls and grocery stores, and disseminating posters to activists mobilizing against the war machine. THINK AGAIN has distributed tens of thousands of printed matter free-of-charge through art spaces, grassroots community organizations, unions and the internet. Documentation of the work of THINK AGAIN can be found at http://sabachman.com and http://www.dja-art.work

=== Projects ===
*'''Actions Speak''' (2008-2010) is a multi-media project examining political brutality and public policy, and reconsiders social problems like HIV/AIDS and violence against women. The project features a 17 x 67 foot interior wall mural and a concurrent outdoor projection.  Debuting the week before the 2008 Presidential Election, ''Actions Speak'' promotes dialogue between art and public response, between global reality and local action. Commissioned by the [[Worcester Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agitart.org/actionsspeak/ www.agitart.org/actionsspeak]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-m-l.org/?q=node/171 www.c-m-l.org/?q=node/171]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://agitart.org/actionsspeak/press/afterimage.pdf AFTERIMAGE Vol. 38 No. 2]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The NAFTA Effect''' (2006-2007) is a series of public projections in Los Angeles addressing how [[free trade]] reshapes the lives of people on both sides of the [[United States–Mexico border]].
*'''Hola/Hello''' (2002 and 2006) includes postcards and installations that link the rape, sexualized violence, and [[Female homicides in Ciudad Juárez|murder of over three hundred unidentified women]] in [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], to the structural effects of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and intergovernmental relations between the US and Mexico.
*'''Protestgraphics''' (2001-2004) was one of the first websites to respond to the 9/11, U.S. military action in Iraq and Central Asia, violence against Arab and Muslim Americans, and to the Bush administration's [[War on Terrorism]]. In addition to the online archive, 500 sets of posters were distributed free of charge to organizations and activists internationally. Major campaign:  "Act Like It's A Globe, Not An Empire."
*'''CIA.TV''' (2001-2003) included a mobile billboard in [[Los Angeles, California]] and a web debate inviting the public to think critically about the increasingly blurry lines between news and entertainment at a political moment when federal agencies want permission to withhold information from the public, seek expanded surveillance authority and increase their budgets.
*'''Target Marketing Is Not A Social Movement''' (2001-2002) is a mobile billboard and postcard project that addressed [[target market]]ing and "Gay Chic."
*'''Popping The Question''' (2000) is a caravan of mobile billboards circulated throughout the cities of [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and [[San Francisco, California]] intended to inspire public debate about the topics of marriage and family.

'''Théâtre Hébertot''' {{IPA-fr|te.ɑtʁ e.bɛʁ.to|}} is a theatre at 78, boulevard des Batignolles, in the [[17th arrondissement of Paris]], France. The theatre, completed in 1838 and opening as the '''Théâtre des Batignolles''', was later renamed '''Théâtre des Arts''' in 1907. It acquired its present name in 1940 after [[playwright]] and journalist [[Jacques Hébertot]].

Théâtre Hébertot has a seating capacity of 630 for the main stage, and completed construction on a smaller stage, l'Petit Hébertot, in 2001. The Hebertot is one of the few Paris theaters that has shows in English as well as French.

Danièle and Pierre Franck are its current directors.

[[File:Triumph4-Mantegna-vase-bearers.jpg|thumb|320px|''The Vase Bearers'' (fourth canvas)]]
[[File:Triumph1-Mantegna-picture-bearers.jpg|thumb|320px|''Picture Bearers'' (first canvas)]]
The '''''Triumphs of Caesar''''' are a series of nine large paintings created by the [[Italian Renaissance]] artist [[Andrea Mantegna]] between 1484 and 1492&lt;ref&gt;Great Works, ''The Triumphs of Caesar (1484-92)'' Tom Lubbock, ''The Independent'', 6 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] [[Ducal Palace, Mantua]]. They depict a triumphal military parade celebrating the victory of [[Julius Caesar]] in the [[Gallic Wars]]. Acknowledged from the time of Mantegna as his greatest masterpiece, they remain the most complete pictorial representation of a [[Roman triumph]] ever attempted and together they form the world's largest metric area of Italian Renaissance paintings outside Italy. Acquired by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1629, they now form part of the [[Royal Collection]] at [[Hampton Court Palace]] near London, where they occupy a special gallery, with a new continuous frame intended to capture their original setting, mounted into panelling.

Originally painted in the fragile medium of egg and glue [[tempera]] on canvas, the paintings underwent successive repaintings and restorations through the centuries, and are damaged in many areas.  Each canvas measures 2.66 x 2.78&amp;nbsp;m. In total they cover an area more than 70 metres square.

== Subject ==
The series depicts Caesar on a triumphal chariot returning from his successful campaigns, in a procession of Roman soldiers, standard-bearers, musicians and the spoils of war including an assortment of booty (including arms, intricate sculpture and gold vases), exotic animals and captives. These paintings celebrate two of [[Julius Caesar]]'s greatest campaigns – his victory over the [[Gauls]] and the recovery of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] in [[Asia Minor]]. Mantegna was inspired by written accounts of Caesar's celebratory processions through Rome as well as Roman antiquities in the Duke's collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|1979|p=17,125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giorgio Vasari]] described them as follows: "We can see grouped and cleverly arranged in the Triumph the ornate and beautiful chariot, the figure of a man cursing the victorious hero, the victor's relations, the perfumes, incense and sacrifices, the priests, the bulls crowned for sacrifice, the prisoners, the booty captured by the troops, the rank of the squadrons, the elephants, the spoils, the victories and the cities represented in various chariots, along with a mass of trophies on spears, and with helmets and armour, headgear of all kinds, ornaments and countless pieces of plate." &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vasari|1965|pages=244–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ''Triumphs of Caesar'' were initially painted during 1484&amp;ndash;92&lt;ref&gt;Great Works, ''The Triumphs of Caesar (1484-92)'' Tom Lubbock,  ''The Independent'', 6 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[ducal Palace, Mantua|Ducal Palace]] in [[Mantua]], commissioned by either the Duke [[Federico I Gonzaga]] or, more likely, his son [[Francesco II Gonzaga|Francesco II]].
[[File:Triunphus Caesaris plate 6 - Andreani.jpg|thumb|One of a set of coloured [[chiaroscuro woodcut]]s with added [[gouache]], among the finest in the technique, by [[Andrea Andreani]], 1598/99]]

The Gonzaga dynasty died out in the male line, and the major part of their painting collection was acquired by [[Charles I of England]] in 1629, using as an agent in Italy, the courtier [[Daniel Nys]]. The collection also included works by [[Titian]], [[Raphael]] and [[Caravaggio]]. The ''Triumphs'' arrived in 1630 at Hampton Court Palace, where they have remained ever since. The Lower [[Orangery]] was originally built to house [[Mary II of England]]'s larger tender plants. It was chosen as a setting for the series, since it re-creates the interior of the ''Palace of San Sebastiano'' in [[Mantua]], [[Italy]], where the paintings were hung from 1506 in a specially built gallery.  The paintings are displayed as a continuous [[frieze]], separated by small columns.

After the execution of Charles I in 1649, the ''Triumphs'' were listed in an inventory and valued at 1,000 pounds ({{Inflation|UK|1000|1649|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-4}});{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} the entire Gonzaga acquisition cost 25,000 pounds ({{Inflation|UK|25000|1629|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-4}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} [[Oliver Cromwell]] refrained from selling these paintings, almost alone among Charles's collection, due to their fame, and perhaps as they celebrated a general like himself rather than a monarch or Catholic religious theme.

==Reception and influence==
[[File:Rubens-roman-triumph.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Rubens]], c 1630: ''A Roman Triumph'', [[National Gallery]], [[London]]]]
The ''Triumphs of Caesar'' were described as "the best thing Mantegna ever painted" by [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his celebrated ''[[Lives of the Artists]]''.
They rapidly became extremely famous throughout Europe, principally through copies in [[old master print|print]] form, of which many different versions were made, starting with a contemporary set from Mantegna's own workshop. Between 1517 and 1519, [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], using prints, painted a copy of the work on nine exterior panels of the Hertenstein House in [[Lucerne]], now demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bätschmann|Griener|1997|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrea Aspertini]] (1558&amp;ndash;1629) made prints of the paintings in Mantua.

==Early C20 restoration==
The painter and critic [[Roger Fry]] undertook a restoration of ''The Picture Bearers'' starting in 1910. This was approved by [[Lionel Cust]], Keeper of the King's Pictures. Fry removed what [[Louis Laguerre]] had done a century before, and worked on and off for eleven years, with assistance from [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Dora Carrington]], to repaint parts of the canvas. The art historian [[Frances Spalding]] holds that Fry made many poor artistic and technical decisions, "and, worst of all, they changed the Negro standard bearer into a Caucasian". Fry did not attempt to restore any of the other paintings in the series, and said in 1925 that ''The Picture Bearers'' was "one of [his] maddest follies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spalding|first1=Frances|title=Roger Fry : art and life|date=1980|publisher=Univ. of California press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520041264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960s restoration==
The paintings had so deteriorated that visitors in the 19th century deplored their condition. In the 1960s a careful restoration to reveal the original paintwork was conducted on all but the seventh canvas, where no trace had been left by previous restorers. Although now mere shadows of Mantegna's [[cinquecento]] paintings, they still convey a powerful impression of epic grandeur.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elam|2008|page=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Anthony Blunt]], who as [[Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures]] supervised the restoration, "The ''Triumphs'' may be a ruin but it is a noble one, one as noble as those of ancient Rome which Mantegna so deeply admired."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|1978|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art critic Tom Lubbock, writing about the restored paintings called pictures " the epitome of Renaissance art in the service of state power – they carry a powerful sense of inexorable procession – impressing the viewer with the inexhaustible quantity of available power and plunder." &lt;ref&gt;Great Works, ''The Triumphs of Caesar (1484-92)'' Tom Lubbock,  The Independent, 6 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is now displayed to the public under low level electric light for conservation reasons.

Copies of the paintings were made in the early 17th century by [[Ludovico Dondi]].

|Trophies of captured weapons
|On the second [day] was carried in a great many wagons the finest and richest armour of the Macedonians, both of brass and steel, all newly polished and glittering the pieces of which were piled up and arranged purposely with the greatest art, so as to seem to be tumbled in heaps carelessly and by chance: helmets were thrown upon shields, coats of mail upon greaves; Cretan targets, and Thracian bucklers and quivers of arrows, lay huddled amongst horses' bits, and through these there appeared the points of naked swords, intermixed with long Macedonian sarissas.

|-
|Bearers of booty and coins
|After these wagons loaded with armour there followed three thousand men who carried the silver that was coined, in seven hundred and fifty vessels, each of which weighed three talents, and was carried by four men.

|Others brought silver bowls and goblets and cups, all disposed in such order as to make the best show, and all curious as well for their size as the solidity of their embossed work.

|On the third day, early in the morning, first came the trumpeters, who did not sound as they were wont in a procession or solemn entry, but such a charge as the Romans use when they encourage the soldiers to fight. Next followed young men wearing frocks with ornamented borders, who led to the sacrifice a hundred and twenty stalled oxen, with their horns gilded, and their heads adorned with ribbons and garlands; and with these were boys that carried basins for libation, of silver and gold.

|After this was brought the gold coin, which was divided into vessels that weighed three talents, like those that contained the silver; they were in number seventy-seven. These were followed by those that brought the consecrated bowl which Aemilius had caused to be made, that weighed ten talents, and was set with precious stones. Then were exposed to view the cups of Antigonus and Seleucus, and those of the Thericlean make, and all the gold plate that was used at Perseus's table. Next to these came Perseus's chariot, in which his armour was placed, and on that his diadem.

|And, after a little intermission, the king's children were led captives, and with them a train of their attendants, masters, and teachers, all shedding tears, and stretching out hands to the spectators, and making the children themselves also beg and entreat their compassion. There were two sons and a daughter, whose tender age made them but little sensible of the greatness of their misery, which very insensibility of their condition rendered it the more deplorable; insomuch that Perseus himself was scarcely regarded as he went along, whilst pity fixed the eyes of the Romans upon the infants; and many of them could not forbear tears, and all beheld the sight with a mixture of sorrow and pleasure, until the children were passed.

|Lietors clad in purple tunics preceded the general; also a chorus of musicians and pipers, in imitation of an Etruscan procession, wearing belts and golden crowns, and they march evenly with song and dance. They call themselves Lydi because, as I think, the Etruscans were a Lydian colony. One of these, in the middle of the procession, wearing a purple cloak and golden bracelets and necklace, caused laughter by making various gesticulations, as though he were insulting the enemy.

|After these were carried four hundred crowns, all made of gold, sent from the cities by their respective deputations to Aemilius, in honour of his victory.

|... and after them the general himself on a chariot embellished with various designs, wearing a crown of gold and precious stones, and dressed, according to the fashion of the country, in a purple toga embroidered with golden stars. He bore a sceptre of ivory, and a laurel branch, which is always the Roman symbol of victory. Riding in the same chariot with him were boys and girls, and on horses on either side of him young men, his own relatives. Then followed those who had served him in the war as secretaries, aids, and armor-bearers.
|In his Pontic triumph he displayed among the show-pieces of the procession an inscription of but three words, "I came, I saw, I conquered" - ''[[Veni, vidi, vici]]''

|
|
|
|-
|Senators
|All the army, in like manner, with boughs of laurel in their hands, divided into their hands and companies, followed the chariot of their commander; some singing verses, according to the usual custom, mingled with raillery; others, songs of triumph and the praise of Aemilius's deeds.
|After these came the army arranged in companies and cohorts, all of them crowned and carrying laurel branches, the bravest of them bearing their military prizes. They praised some of their captains, derided others, and reproached others; for in a triumph everybody is free, and is allowed to say what he pleases.

'''Vera Margrethe Henriksen''' (née '''Roscher Lund'''; 22 March 1927 – 23 May 2016) was a Norwegian novelist, playwright, and [[non-fiction]] writer. She was particularly known for her historical novels and plays set in the Middle Ages.

==Biography==
Vera Margrethe Roscher Lund was born in [[Oslo]] and lived there until 1940, when she moved to [[Arendal]]. Her father was military officer, later Colonel [[Ragnvald Alfred Roscher Lund]] (1899–1975),&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; the first commander of the Norwegian Military Intelligence Service, head of the [[Norwegian High Command]]'s office FO II in exile in London during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=kl.fo2&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Berit |last=Nøkleby |encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]] |title=Forsvarets Overkommandos 2. kontor, FO II |language=Norwegian |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit Nøkleby|Nøkleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[Øystein Sørensen|Sørensen]] |url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/f/f4.html#forsvarets-overkommando-2 |accessdate=7 August 2010 |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo |isbn=82-02-14138-9 |page=115 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315114603/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/f/f4.html#forsvarets-overkommando-2 |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, she had to flee Norway during the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

She continued her secondary education at the Norwegian [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Uppsala, Sweden]], and graduated in 1945. The following year she traveled to the United States where her family lived in [[New Jersey]]. She studied architecture at [[Yale University]] from 1946 to 1948.  From 1948 to 1949, she studied [[art history]] and journalism at [[Columbia University]]. She married  shipping executive, Olav Gotfred Henriksen in 1948. In total, she lived in the United States from 1946 to 1963.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Vera Henriksen |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Egil |last=Tveterås |editor=Helle, Knut |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Vera_Henriksen/utdypning  |language=Norwegian|accessdate=7 August 2010 |editor-link=Knut Helle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first novel, ''Sølvhammeren'' (''The Silver Hammer'') was published in 1961. This novel was followed by ''Jærtegn'' (''Miracle'') in 1962, and ''Helgenkongen'' (''The Saint King'') in 1963. The trilogy is about [[Olaf II of Norway]] and his time. In the 1970s she wrote a novel series from the period after the [[Protestant Reformation]], ''Trollsteinen'' from 1970, followed by ''Pilegrimsferd'', ''Blåbreen'', ''Staupet'' and ''Skjærsild'', the last from 1977. Among her historical plays are ''Asbjørn Selsbane'' from 1972, and ''Sverdet'', first staged in 1974.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Vera Henriksen |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |editor=Henriksen, Petter|location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/Vera_Henriksen |language=Norwegian | accessdate=7 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also written books for children and young adults.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Vera Henriksen has an unusually broad and extensive range of writings behind her. She has written or delivered contributions to nearly fifty books. Central is a series of historical novels, some in several volumes, but she has also written contemporary novels, plays and nonfiction. Inspired by her father she developed an early interest in history, especially [[Norse saga]] literature. Several of her books center on the problematic transition from [[Norse mythology]] to [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

In addition to her fiction writing, Henriksen has written several non-fiction books. Among these are two volumes of the history of the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]], covering the period from 1912 until 1945.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

She was decorated Knight, First Class of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; She was awarded the [[Norwegian Booksellers' Prize]] in 1962, and the [[Mads Wiel Nygaard's Endowment]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=nygaards-legat&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forfatterportalen.no/litteraturpriser/legat.htm | title=Mads Wiel Nygaards Legat  |publisher=Forfatterportalen.no |language=Norwegian |accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Hogarth''' [[FRSA]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|oʊ|g|ɑr|θ}}; 10 November 1697 – 26 October 1764) was an English painter, [[Printmaking|printmaker]], pictorial [[satire|satirist]], [[Social criticism|social critic]], and editorial [[cartoonist]]. His work ranged from [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] portraiture to [[comic strip]]-like series of pictures called "modern moral subjects",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dummies.com/education/art-appreciation/the-rococo-influence-in-british-art/|title=The Rococo Influence in British Art – dummies|work=dummies|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps best known being his moral series ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]'', ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' and ''[[Marriage A-la-Mode (Hogarth)|Marriage A-la-Mode]]''.  Knowledge of his work is so pervasive that satirical political illustrations in this style are often referred to as "Hogarthian".&lt;ref&gt;According to Elizabeth Einberg, "by the time he died in October 1764 he had left so indelible a mark on the history of British painting that the term 'Hogarthian' remains instantly comprehensible even today as a valid description of a wry, satirical perception of the human condition." See the exhibition catalog, ''Hogarth the Painter'', London: Tate Gallery, 1997, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogarth was born in [[London]] to a lower middle-class family. In his youth he took up an apprenticeship where he specialised in engraving. His father underwent periods of mixed fortune, and was at one time imprisoned in lieu of outstanding debts; an event that is thought to have informed William's paintings and prints with a hard edge.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth, vol. 1: The 'Modern Moral Subject', 1697–1732'' (New Brunswick 1991), pp. 26–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by French and Italian painting and engraving,&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Antal]], ''Hogarth and His Place in European Art'' (London 1962); Robin Simon, ''Hogarth, France and British Art: The rise of the arts in eighteenth-century Britain'' (London 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Hogarth's works are mostly satirical caricatures, sometimes bawdily sexual,&lt;ref&gt;Bernd W. Krysmanski, ''Hogarth's Hidden Parts: Satiric Allusion, Erotic Wit, Blasphemous Bawdiness and Dark Humour in Eighteenth-Century English Art'' (Hildesheim, Zurich and New York: Georg Olms 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; mostly of the first rank of realistic portraiture. They became widely popular and mass-produced via prints in his lifetime, and he was by far the most significant English artist of his generation.

==Early life==
[[File:William Hogarth by Roubiliac, 1741, National Portrait Gallery, London.JPG|thumb|upright|''William Hogarth'' by [[Roubiliac]], 1741, National Portrait Gallery, London]]
William Hogarth was born at Bartholomew Close in London to Richard Hogarth, a poor [[Latin]] school teacher and textbook writer, and Anne Gibbons. In his youth he was apprenticed to the engraver Ellis Gamble in [[Leicester Fields]], where he learned to engrave [[trade card]]s and similar products.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=6193 Ellis Gamble Biographical Details]. The British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. H. K. Wright. [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2ulEAQAAMAAJ&amp;rdid=book-2ulEAQAAMAAJ&amp;rdot=1 The Journal of the Ex Libris Society, Volume 3] (A &amp; C. Black, Plymouth, 1894)&lt;/ref&gt;

Young Hogarth also took a lively interest in the street life of the metropolis and the London fairs, and amused himself by sketching the characters he saw.  Around the same time, his father, who had opened an unsuccessful Latin-speaking [[coffee house]] at [[St John's Gate]], was [[debtor prison|imprisoned for debt]] in [[Fleet Prison]] for five years. Hogarth never spoke of his father's imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 1 (New Brunswick 1991), pp. 26–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogarth became a member of the [[Rose and Crown Club]], with [[Peter Tillemans]], [[George Vertue]], [[Michael Dahl]], and other artists and connoisseurs.&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, Katherine, 'Lens [Laus] family (per. c. 1650–1779), artists' in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

{{See also|List of works by William Hogarth}}

By April 1720, Hogarth was an [[engraver]] in his own right, at first engraving coats of arms, shop bills, and designing plates for booksellers.

In 1727, he was hired by Joshua Morris, a tapestry worker, to prepare a design for the ''Element of Earth''. Morris heard that he was "an engraver, and no painter", and consequently declined the work when completed. Hogarth accordingly sued him for the money in the [[Westminster Hall#Westminster Hall|Westminster Court]], where the case was decided in his favour on 28 May 1728. In 1757 he was appointed [[Serjeant Painter]] to the King.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 3 (New Brunswick 1993), pp. 213–216.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early works===
[[File:HogarthWanstead.jpg|thumb|280px|left|''[[The Assembly at Wanstead House]]''. [[Richard Child, 1st Earl Tylney|Earl Tylney]] and family in foreground]]
Early satirical works included an ''[[Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme]]'' (c.1721, published 1724), about the disastrous stock market crash of 1720 known as the [[South Sea Bubble]], in which many English people lost a great deal of money. In the bottom left corner, he shows [[Protestant]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], and [[Jewish]] figures gambling, while in the middle there is a huge machine, like a merry-go-round, which people are boarding. At the top is a goat, written below which is "Who'l Ride". The people are scattered around the picture with a sense of disorder, while the progress of the well dressed people towards the ride in the middle shows the foolishness of the crowd in buying stock in the [[South Sea Company]], which spent more time issuing stock than anything else.&lt;ref&gt;See Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'' (3rd edition, London 1989), no. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early works include ''The Lottery'' (1724); ''The Mystery of Masonry brought to Light by the Gormagons'' (1724);  ''[[A Just View of the British Stage]]'' (1724); some book illustrations; and the small print ''Masquerades and Operas'' (1724). The latter is a satire on contemporary follies, such as the [[masquerade ball|masquerades]] of the Swiss impresario [[John James Heidegger]], the popular Italian [[Opera|opera singers]], [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]]'s pantomimes at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], and the exaggerated popularity of [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]]'s protégé, the architect and painter [[William Kent]]. He continued that theme in 1727, with the ''Large Masquerade Ticket''. In 1726 Hogarth prepared twelve large engravings for [[Samuel Butler (1612–1680)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Hudibras]]''. 
[[File:William Hogarth - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Self-Portrait'' by Hogarth, ca. 1735, [[Yale Center for British Art]].]] These he himself valued highly, and they are among his best book illustrations.

In the following years he turned his attention to the production of small "[[Conversation piece (paintings)|conversation piece]]s" (i.e., groups in oil of full-length portraits from {{convert|12|to|15|in}} high). Among his efforts in oil between 1728 and 1732 were ''The Fountaine Family'' (c.1730), ''The Assembly at Wanstead House'', ''The House of Commons examining Bambridge'', and several pictures of the chief actors in [[John Gay]]'s popular ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 1, pp. 172–185, 206–215.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his real low-life and real-life subjects was [[Sarah Malcolm]] whom he sketched two days before her execution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/hogarth/hogarth-room-guide-room-8 Sarah Malcolm], The Hogarth Room, The Tate, retrieved 7 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Hogarth's masterpieces of this period is the depiction of an amateur performance by children of [[John Dryden]]'s ''The Indian Emperor, or The Conquest of Mexico'' (1732–1735) at the home of [[John Conduitt]], master of the mint, in [[Hanover Square, London|St George's Street, Hanover Square]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 2 (New Brunswick 1992), pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogarth's other works in the 1730s include ''A Midnight Modern Conversation'' (1733), ''Southwark Fair'' (1733), ''The Sleeping Congregation'' (1736), [[Before and After (Hogarth)|''Before'' and ''After'']] (1736), ''Scholars at a Lecture'' (1736), ''The Company of Undertakers (Consultation of Quacks)'' (1736), ''[[The Distrest Poet]]'' (1736), ''[[The Four Times of the Day]]'' (1738), and ''[[Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn]]'' (1738). He might also have printed ''Burlington Gate'' (1731), evoked by [[Alexander Pope]]'s Epistle to [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]], and defending Lord Chandos, who is therein satirized. This print gave great offence, and was suppressed. However, modern authorities such as Ronald Paulson no longer attribute it to Hogarth.&lt;ref&gt;See Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moralizing art===

====Harlot's and Rake's Progresses====
[[File:The Rake's Progress 8.jpg|thumb|''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', Plate 8, 1735, and retouched by Hogarth in 1763 by adding the Britannia emblem&lt;ref&gt;[[#JBN1833|J. B. Nichols, 1833]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=2xIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;hl=en p.192] "PLATE VIII. ... Britannia 1763"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#JBN1833|J. B.

In 1731 Hogarth completed the earliest of his series of moral works, a body of work that led to significant recognition. The collection of six scenes was entitled ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]'' and appeared first as paintings (now lost)&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press 2016), nos. 21–26.&lt;/ref&gt; before being published as engravings.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition (London: The Print Room 1989), nos. 121–126.&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Harlot's Progress'' depicts the fate of a country girl who begins prostituting&amp;nbsp;– the six scenes are chronological, starting with a meeting with a bawd and ending with a funeral ceremony that follows the character's death from venereal disease.&lt;ref&gt;Cruickshank, Dan (2010). ''London's Sinful Secret: The Bawdy History and Very Public Passions of London's Georgian Age''. Macmillan. pp. 19–20. {{ISBN|1429919566}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural series was an immediate success and was followed in 1733–1735 by the sequel ''[[A Rake's Progress]]''.&lt;ref&gt;For the paintings, see Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', nos. 74–81. For the engravings, see Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 132–139.&lt;/ref&gt; The second instalment consisted of eight pictures that depicted the reckless life of Tom Rakewell, the son of a rich merchant, who spends all of his money on luxurious living, services from prostitutes, and gambling&amp;nbsp;– the character's life ultimately ends in [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]]. The original paintings of ''A Harlot's Progress'' were destroyed in the fire at [[Fonthill Abbey|Fonthill House]] in 1755; the oil paintings of ''A Rake's Progress'' (1733–34) are displayed in the gallery room at [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], London, UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Rake's Progress|url=http://www.soane.org/collections_legacy/the_soane_hogarths/rakes_progress|work=Sir John Soane's Museum|publisher=Sir John Soane's Museum|accessdate=13 December 2013|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the success of ''A Harlot's Progress'' and ''A Rake's Progress'' resulted in numerous pirated reproductions by unscrupulous printsellers, Hogarth lobbied in parliament for greater legal control over the reproduction of his and other artists' work. The result was the [[Engraving Copyright Act 1734|Engravers’ Copyright Act]] (known as ‘Hogarth's Act’), which became law on 25 June 1735 and was the first copyright law to deal with visual works as well as the first to recognize the authorial rights of an individual artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verhoogt|first1=Robert|title=Art in Reproduction: Nineteenth-century Prints After Lawrence Alma-tadema, Jozef Israels and Ary Scheffer|date=2007|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9053569138|pages=15–16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSDnRo7YrWwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marriage à-la-mode====
[[Image:Marriage A-la-Mode 2, The Tête à Tête - William Hogarth.jpg|thumb|''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'', ''[[Marriage à-la-mode: 2. The Tête à Tête|Shortly After the Marriage]]'' (scene two of six).]]
[[File:Marriage A-la-Mode 4, The Toilette - William Hogarth.jpg|thumbnail|''Marriage à-la-mode'', ''[[Marriage à-la-mode: 4. The Toilette|After the old Earl's funeral]]'' (scene four of six)]]

In 1743–1745, Hogarth painted the six pictures of ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'' ([[National Gallery, London]]),&lt;ref&gt;Judy Egerton, ''Hogarth's 'Marriage A-la-Mode' '', London: The National Gallery 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; a pointed skewering of upper-class 18th-century society. This moralistic warning shows the miserable tragedy of an ill-considered marriage for money. This is regarded by many as his finest project and may be among his best-planned story serials.

Marital ethics were the topic of much debate in 18th-century Britain. The many marriages of convenience and their attendant unhappiness came in for particular criticism, with a variety of authors taking the view that love was a much sounder basis for marriage. Hogarth here painted a satire – a genre that by definition has a moral point to convey – of a conventional marriage within the English upper class. All the paintings were engraved and the series achieved wide circulation in print form. The series, which is set in a Classical interior, shows the story of the fashionable marriage of Viscount Squanderfield, the son of bankrupt Earl Squander, to the daughter of a wealthy but miserly city merchant, starting with the signing of a marriage contract at the Earl's mansion and ending with the murder of the son by his wife's lover and the suicide of the daughter after her lover is hanged at [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn]] for murdering her husband.

[[William Makepeace Thackeray]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;This famous set of pictures contains the most important and highly wrought of the Hogarth comedies. The care and method with which the moral grounds of these pictures are laid is as remarkable as the wit and skill of the observing and dexterous artist. He has to describe the negotiations for a marriage pending between the daughter of a rich citizen Alderman and young Lord Viscount Squanderfield, the dissipated son of a gouty old Earl ... The dismal end is known. My lord draws upon the counselor, who kills him, and is apprehended while endeavouring to escape. My lady goes back perforce to the Alderman of the City, and faints upon reading Counsellor Silvertongue's dying speech at Tyburn (place of execution in old London), where the counselor has been 'executed for sending his lordship out of the world. Moral: don’t listen to evil silver-tongued counselors; don't marry a man for his rank, or a woman for her money; don't frequent foolish auctions and masquerade balls unknown to your husband; don't have wicked companions abroad and neglect your wife, otherwise you will be run through the body, and ruin will ensue, and disgrace, and Tyburn.&lt;ref&gt;Thackeray, William Makepeace, ''The English Humourists of the Eighteenth Century''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Industry and Idleness====
[[Image:William Hogarth - Industry and Idleness, Plate 1; The Fellow 'Prentices at their Looms.png|thumb|right|''Industry and Idleness'' Plate 1, The Fellow 'Prentices at their Looms]]
In the twelve prints of ''[[Industry and Idleness]]'' (1747)&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 168–179.&lt;/ref&gt; Hogarth shows the progression in the lives of two apprentices, one of whom is dedicated and hard working, while the other, who is idle, commits crime and is eventually executed. This shows the work ethic of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] England, where those who worked hard were rewarded, such as the industrious apprentice who becomes [[Sheriff of London|Sheriff]] (plate 8), [[Alderman]] (plate 10), and finally the [[Sheriffs of the City of London|Lord Mayor]] of London in the last plate in the series. The idle apprentice, who begins "at play in the church yard" (plate 3), holes up "in a Garrett with a Common Prostitute" after turning [[highwayman]] (plate 7) and "executed at Tyburn" (plate 11). The idle apprentice is sent to the [[gallows]] by the industrious apprentice himself. For each plate, there is at least one passage from the Bible at the bottom, most from the [[Book of Proverbs]], such as for the first plate of "Industry and Idleness, shown here, "Proverbs Ch:10 Ver:4  The hand of the diligent maketh rich."

====Beer Street and Gin Lane====
[[Image:GinLane.jpg|''[[Gin Lane]]''|thumb]]

Later prints of significance include his pictorial warning of the consequences of alcoholism in [[Beer Street and Gin Lane|''Beer Street'' and ''Gin Lane'']] (1751).&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Hogarth engraved ''Beer Street'' to show a happy city drinking the 'good' beverage, English [[beer]], in contrast to ''Gin Lane'', in which the effects of drinking gin are shown – as a more potent liquor, gin caused more problems for society.&lt;ref&gt;See Mark Hallett, ''The Spectacle of Difference'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999), pp.198–222.&lt;/ref&gt; People are shown as healthy, happy and prosperous in ''Beer Street'', while in ''Gin Lane'' they are scrawny, lazy and careless. The woman at the front of ''Gin Lane'', who lets her baby fall to its death, echoes the tale of Judith Dufour, who strangled her baby so she could sell its clothes for gin money.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/11202643/Hogarth-the-father-of-the-modern-cartoon.html "Hogarth, the father of the modern cartoon", ''The Telegraph'', 13 May 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; The prints were published in support of the [[Gin Act 1751]].

Hogarth's friend, the magistrate [[Henry Fielding]], may have enlisted Hogarth to help with propaganda for the Gin Act: ''Beer Street'' and ''Gin Lane'' were issued shortly after his work ''An Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase of Robbers, and Related Writings'', and addressed the same issues.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/w/william_hogarth,_beer_street.aspx "William Hogarth, Beer Street and Gin Lane, two prints", British Museum.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031115252/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/w/william_hogarth,_beer_street.aspx |date=31 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Four Stages of Cruelty====
Other prints were his outcry against inhumanity in ''[[The Four Stages of Cruelty]]'' (published 21 February 1751),&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition (London: The Print Room 1989), nos. 168–179.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Hogarth depicts the cruel treatment of animals which he saw around him and suggests what will happen to people who carry on in this manner. In the first picture there are scenes of torture of dogs, cats and other animals. The second shows one of the characters from the first painting, Tom Nero, has now become a coach driver, and his cruelty to his horse has caused it to break its leg. In the third painting Tom is shown as a murderer, with the woman he killed lying on the ground, while in the fourth, titled ''Reward of Cruelty'', the murderer is shown being dissected by scientists after his execution.  The method of execution, and the dissection, reflect the 1752 [[Act of Parliament]] allowing for the dissection of executed criminals who had been convicted for murder.

===Portraits===
[[File:William Hogarth - David Garrick as Richard III - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[David Garrick]] as Richard III, 1745]]
[[File:Hogarth, William - Portrait of a Man - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Portrait of a Man, 1741]]

Hogarth was also a popular [[portrait painter]]. In 1745 he painted actor [[David Garrick]] as [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]],&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; for which he was paid £200, "which was more", he wrote, "than any English artist ever received for a single portrait." In 1746 a sketch of [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat]], afterwards beheaded on Tower Hill, had an exceptional success.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, no. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1740&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Ellis. (1994) ''Painting in Britain 1530–1790''. 5th edn. New Haven and London: [[Yale University Press]], p. 175. {{ISBN|0300058330}}&lt;/ref&gt; he created a truthful, vivid full-length portrait of his friend, the philanthropic [[Thomas Coram|Captain Coram]] for the [[Thomas Coram Foundation for Children]], now in the [[Foundling Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; and his unfinished oil sketch of a young fishwoman, entitled ''[[The Shrimp Girl]]'' ([[National Gallery, London]]),&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; may be called masterpieces of [[British painting]]. There are also portraits of his wife and his two sisters, and of many other people, among them Bishop [[Benjamin Hoadly|Hoadly]] and Bishop [[Thomas Herring|Herring]].

===Historical subjects===
For a long period of his life, Hogarth tried to achieve the status of [[history painter]], but had no great success in this field.

====Biblical scenes====
Examples of his history pictures are ''The Pool of Bethesda'' and ''The Good Samaritan'', executed in 1736–1737 for [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]];&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press 2016), nos. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Moses brought before Pharaoh's Daughter'', painted for the [[Foundling Hospital]] (1747, formerly at the [[Thomas Coram Foundation for Children]], now in the [[Foundling Museum]]);&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paul before Felix'' (1748) at [[Lincoln's Inn]];&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; and his altarpiece for [[St. Mary Redcliffe]], [[Bristol]] (1755–56).&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Gate of Calais====
''[[The Gate of Calais]]'' (1748; now in [[Tate Britain]]) was produced soon after his return from a visit to France.&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace Walpole]] wrote that Hogarth had run a great risk to go there since the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|peace of Aix-la-Chapelle]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;he went to France, and was so imprudent as to be taking a sketch of the drawbridge at [[Calais]]. He was seized and carried to the governor, where he was forced to prove his vocation by producing several [[caricatures]] of the French; particularly a scene of the shore, with an immense piece of beef landing for the ''Lion d'argent'', the English inn at Calais, and several hungry friars following it. They were much diverted with his drawings, and dismissed him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Back home, he immediately executed a painting of the subject in which he unkindly represented his enemies, the [[French people|Frenchmen]], as cringing, emaciated and superstitious people, while an enormous sirloin of beef arrives, destined for the English inn as a symbol of British prosperity and superiority. He claimed to have painted himself into the picture in the left corner sketching the gate, with a "soldier's hand upon my shoulder", running him in.&lt;ref&gt;[[#JBN1833|J. B. Nichols, 1833]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=nwgIAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22William+Hogarth%22&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1#PPA63,M1 p.63] "in one corner introduced my own portrait"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other later works===

Notable Hogarth engravings in the 1740s include ''[[The Enraged Musician]]'' (1741), the six prints of ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'' (1745; executed by French artists under Hogarth's inspection), and ''The Stage Coach or The Country Inn Yard'' (1747).&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 152, 158–163, 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1745 Hogarth painted a self-portrait with his pug dog [[Trump (dog)|Trump]] (now also in [[Tate Britain]]), which shows him as a learned artist supported by volumes of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[John Milton|Milton]] and [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]].&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1749, he represented the somewhat disorderly English troops on their ''[[March of the Guards to Finchley]]'' (formerly located in [[Thomas Coram Foundation for Children]], now [[Foundling Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others works included his ingenious ''[[Satire on False Perspective]]'' (1754);&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, no. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; his satire on canvassing in his ''[[Humours of an Election|Election]]'' series (1755–1758; now in [[Sir John Soane's Museum]]);&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', nos. 214–217.&lt;/ref&gt; his ridicule of the English passion for [[cockfighting]] in ''The Cockpit'' (1759); his attack on [[Methodism]] in ''[[Credulity, Superstition, and Fanaticism]]'' (1762); his political anti-war satire in ''The Times'', plate I (1762); and his pessimistic view of all things in ''Tailpiece, or The Bathos'' (1764).&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 206, 210a, 211, 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
[[File:Analysis of Beauty Plate 1 by William Hogarth.jpg|thumb|''[[The Analysis of Beauty]]'' plate 1 (1753)]]
Hogarth wrote and published his ideas of artistic design in his book ''[[The Analysis of Beauty]]'' (1753).&lt;ref&gt;William Hogarth, ''The Analysis of Beauty'' (1753), ed. Ronald Paulson, New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-300-07346-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he professes to define the principles of beauty and grace which he, a real child of [[Rococo]], saw realized in serpentine lines (the [[Line of Beauty]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/r/rococo|title=Rococo – Art Term {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|work=Tate|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; By some of Hogarth's adherents, the book was praised as a fine deliverance upon aesthetics; by his enemies and rivals, its obscurities and minor errors were made the subject of endless ridicule and caricature.&lt;ref&gt;Timbs, John (1881). [https://books.google.com/books?id=gF5JAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq= ''Anecdote Lives of William Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Gainsborough, Henry Fuseli, Sir Thomas Lawrence, and J.M.W. Turner'']. R. Bentley. pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Painter and engraver of modern moral subjects===
Hogarth lived in an age when artwork became increasingly commercialized, being viewed in shop windows, [[tavern]]s, and public buildings, and sold in [[old master print|printshop]]s. Old hierarchies broke down, and new forms began to flourish: the [[ballad opera]], the [[bourgeois tragedy]], and especially, a new form of [[fiction]] called the [[novel]] with which authors such as [[Henry Fielding]] had great success. Therefore, by that time, Hogarth hit on a new idea: "painting and engraving modern moral subjects ... to treat my subjects as a dramatic writer; my picture was my stage", as he himself remarked in his manuscript notes.

He drew from the highly moralizing [[Protestant]] tradition of Dutch [[genre painting]], and the very vigorous satirical traditions of the English [[broadsheet]] and other types of popular print. In England the fine arts had little comedy in them before Hogarth. His prints were expensive, and remained so until early 19th-century reprints brought them to a wider audience.

===Parodic borrowings from Old Masters===
When analysing the work of the artist as a whole, [[Ronald Paulson]] says, "In ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]'', every single plate but one is based on [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]]'s images of the story of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin]] and the story of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]." In other works, he parodies [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|Last Supper]]. According to Paulson, Hogarth is subverting the religious establishment and the orthodox belief in an immanent [[God]] who intervenes in the lives of people and produces [[miracle]]s. Indeed, Hogarth was a [[Deist]], a believer in a God who created the universe but takes no direct hand in the lives of his creations. Thus, as a "comic history painter", he often poked fun at the old-fashioned, "beaten" subjects of religious art in his paintings and prints. Hogarth also rejected [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]]'s then-current ideal of the [[Art in ancient Greece#Classical|classical Greek]] male in favour of the living, breathing female. He said, "Who but a bigot, even to the [[antiques]], will say that he has not seen faces and necks, hands and arms in living women, that even the Grecian [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] doth but coarsely imitate."

==Personal life==

On 23 March 1729 Hogarth married Jane Thornhill, daughter of artist Sir [[James Thornhill]].

Hogarth was initiated as a [[Freemason]] before 1728 in the Lodge at the Hand and Apple Tree Tavern, Little Queen Street, and later belonged to the Carrier Stone Lodge and the Grand Stewards' Lodge; the latter still possesses the 'Hogarth Jewel' which Hogarth designed for the Lodge's Master to wear.&lt;ref&gt;See references in [http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/beresiner11.html this biography].&lt;/ref&gt; Today the original is in storage and a replica is worn by the Master of the Lodge. Freemasonry was a theme in some of Hogarth's work, most notably 'Night', the fourth in the quartet of paintings (later released as engravings) collectively entitled the ''[[Four Times of the Day]]''.

His main home was in Leicester Square (then known as Leicester Fields), but he bought a country retreat in [[Chiswick]] in 1749, the house now known as [[Hogarth's House]] and preserved as a museum, and spent time there for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hounslow.info/arts-culture/historic-houses-museums/hogarth-house/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123103341/http://www.hounslow.info/arts-culture/historic-houses-museums/hogarth-house/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2018-01-23|title=Hogarth’s House {{!}} Hounslow.info|date=2018-01-23|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/031005/n031005_24.htm |title=Camden New Journal |author=Joel Taylor |work=camdennewjournal.co.uk |date=11 March 2005 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Hogarths had no children, although they fostered foundling children. He was a founding Governor of the [[Foundling Hospital]].

Among his friends and acquaintances were many English artists and satirists of the period, such as [[Francis Hayman]], [[Henry Fielding]], and [[Laurence Sterne]].

==Death==
[[File:William Hogarth's tomb.jpg|thumb|upright|Tomb of William and Jane Hogarth]]

Hogarth died in London on 26 October 1764 and was buried at [[St. Nicholas Church, Chiswick]], London. His friend, actor [[David Garrick]], composed the following inscription for his tombstone:

{{poemquote|Farewell great Painter of Mankind
Who reach'd the noblest point of Art
Whose pictur'd Morals charm the Mind
And through the Eye correct the Heart.

If Genius fire thee, Reader, stay,
If Nature touch thee, drop a Tear:
If neither move thee, turn away,

Hogarth's works were a direct influence on [[John Collier (caricaturist)|John Collier]], who was known as the "Lancashire Hogarth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hignett|first=Tim|publisher=George Kelsall Publishing|year=1991|title=Milnrow &amp; Newhey: A Lancashire Legacy|isbn=0-946571-19-8|location=[[Littleborough, Greater Manchester|Littleborough]]|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of Hogarth's prints throughout Europe, together with the depiction of popular scenes from his prints in faked Hogarth prints, influenced Continental book illustration through the 18th and early 19th centuries, especially in Germany and France. He also influenced many caricaturists of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Hogarth's influence lives on today as artists continue to draw inspiration from his work.

Hogarth's paintings and prints have provided the subject matter for several other works. For example, [[Gavin Gordon (composer)|Gavin Gordon]]'s 1935 ballet ''[[The Rake's Progress (ballet)|The Rake's Progress]]'', to choreography by [[Ninette de Valois]], was based directly on Hogarth's series of paintings of that title. [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s 1951 [[opera]] ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', with libretto by [[W. H. Auden]], was less literally inspired by the same series. Hogarth's engravings also inspired the [[BBC radio]] play ''The Midnight House'' by Jonathan Hall, based on the [[M. R. James]] ghost story "[[The Mezzotint]]" and first broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in 2006.

[[Russell Banks]]' short story "Indisposed" is a fictional account of Hogarth's infidelity as told from the viewpoint of his wife, Jane. Hogarth was the lead character in [[Nick Dear]]'s play ''[[The Art of Success]]'', whilst he is played by [[Toby Jones]] in the 2006 television film ''[[A Harlot's Progress (film)|A Harlot's Progress]]''.

[[Hogarth's House]] in [[Chiswick]], west London, is now a museum; it abuts one of London's best known [[road junction]]s – the [[Hogarth Roundabout]]. In 2014 both Hogarth's House and the Foundling Museum held special exhibitions to mark the 250th anniversary of his death.
