      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11665">The '''Art Workers' Coalition''' (AWC) was an open coalition of artists, filmmakers, writers, critics, and museum staff that formed in [[New York, New York|New York City]] in January 1969. Its principal aim was to pressure the city's museums – notably the [[MoMA|Museum of Modern Art]] – into implementing economic and political reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://artsandlabor.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Lippard_AWC.pdf|title = The Art Workers Coalition: Not a History|last = Lippard|first = Lucy|date = November 1970|journal = Studio International|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These included a more open and less exclusive exhibition policy concerning the artists they exhibited and promoted: the absence of women artists and artists of color was a principal issue of contention, which led to the formation of [[Women Artists in Revolution]] (WAR) in 1969. The coalition successfully pressured the MoMA and other museums into implementing a free admission day that still exists in certain museums to this day. It also pressured and picketed museums into taking a moral stance on the [[Vietnam War]] which resulted in its famous [[My Lai]] poster ''[[And babies]]'', one of the most important works of political art of the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art Workers, Radical Practice in the Vietnam War Era|last = Bryan-Wilson|first = Julia|publisher = University of California Press|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Berkeley|pages = |url = http://www.darkmatterarchives.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Bryan-Wilson-Art-Workers-excerpt.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poster was displayed during demonstrations in front of [[Pablo Picasso]]′s [[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]] at the MoMA in 1970.

==Origins==

The AWC grew out of an incident at MoMA during the exhibition curated by [[Pontus Hulten]], ''The Machine at the End of the Mechanical Age'': on January 3, 1969, Greek [[Kinetic art|kinetic sculptor]] [[Takis]], with the support of friends, physically removed his work from the exhibition. Although the work, ''Tele-sculpture'' (1960), had been purchased by the MoMA in 1963 and thus belonged to its permanent collection, Takis was unhappy with the museum's lack of consultation in choosing a work for exhibition which he considered no longer adequately represented his current artistic practice. The artist took his work into the museum's sculpture garden and remained there until he received confirmation from museum officials that his work would be withdrawn from the exhibition. The incident led to a series of meetings held at the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]] in which the group that had supported Takis's action discussed issues relating to the political and social responsibility of the art community.  The group included Takis, [[United States|American]] kinetic sculptor [[Wen-Ying Tsai]], [[Germany|German]] [[conceptual artist]] [[Hans Haacke]], American writer and independent curator [[Willoughby Sharp]], co-founder of ''Avalanche'' [[Liza Bear]], American artist and ''[[The Village Voice|Village Voice]]'' [[art critic]] [[John Perreault]], and American [[Minimalism|minimalist]] artist [[Carl Andre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== 13 Demands ==
The 13 Demands that AWC submitted to Lowry were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2016/07/29/from-the-archives-faith-ringgold-the-art-workers-coalition-and-the-fight-for-inclusion-at-the-museum-of-modern-art/|title=MoMA {{!}} From the Archives: Faith Ringgold, the Art Workers Coalition, and the Fight for Inclusion at The Museum of Modern Art|website=www.moma.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The Museum should hold a public hearing during February on the topic "The Museum's Relationship to Artists and to Society", which should conform to the recognized rules of procedure for public hearings. 
# A section of the Museum, under the direction of black artists, should be devoted to showing the accomplishments of Black artists. 
# The Museum's activities should be extended into the Black, Spanish and other communities. It should also encourage exhibits with which these groups can identify. 
# A committee of artists with curatorial responsibilities should be set up annually to arrange exhibits. 
# The Museum should be open on two evenings until midnight and admission should be free at all times. 
# Artists should be paid a rental fee for the exhibition of their works. 
# The Museum should recognize an artist's right to refuse showing a work owned by the Museum in any exhibition other than one of the Museum's permanent collection. 
# The Museum should declare its position on copyright legislation and the proposed arts proceeds act. It should also take active steps to inform artists of their legal rights. 
# A registry of artists should be instituted at the Museum. Artists who wish to be registered should supply the Museum with documentation of their work, in the form of photographs, news clippings, etc., and this material should be added to the existing artists' files. 
# The Museum should exhibit experimental works requiring unique environmental conditions at locations outside the Museum. 
# A section of the Museum should be permanently devoted to showing the works of artists without galleries. 
# The Museum should include among its staff persons qualified to handle the installation and maintenance of technological works. The Museum should appoint a responsible person to handle any grievances arising from its dealings with artists. 
==Subsequent Activities==

Upon receiving AWC's 13 Demands, MoMA met and held a dialogue with artist representatives from AWC that was publicly acknowledged. Lowry and MoMA, however, refused to meet all of the specific demands of the AWC, such as the demand to hold a public hearing on the topic "The Museum's Relationship to Artists and to Society".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/art-workers-coalition-demonstrates-artists-rights-1969|title=Art Workers’ Coalition demonstrates for artists’ rights, 1969 {{!}} Global Nonviolent Action Database|website=nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; After organizing a number of demonstrations in front of the museum, the group held an open hearing at the New York [[School of Visual Arts]] on 10 April 1969. The event was retitled "What Should Be the Program of The Art Workers Regarding Museum Reform, and to Establish the Program of the Art Workers' Coalition." Some three hundred artists and members of the New York art community attended the hearing. The initial demands that had been made to the MoMA were debated within the larger group that formed during the open hearing, and later refined and addressed to all New York Museums. Artists and critics subsequently debated various subjects of contention including artists' rights, museum policy and broader political issues including the [[Vietnam War]]. On 15 October 1969, the AWC organized a successful "[[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Moratorium]] of Art to End the [[War in Vietnam]]." The MoMA, the [[Whitney Museum]], the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] and a large number of commercial [[art gallery|art galleries]] closed for the day. The [[Metropolitan Museum]] and the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] did not comply, although, under pressure from the AWC, the Metropolitan did postpone the opening of its American painting and sculpture show scheduled for that day, while the Guggenheim was picketed. The coalition's activities eventually led to changes in how museums interact with artists, a contribution to the art world that is considered lasting in spite of the coalition's short three-year existence. The AWC ceased its activities at the end of 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Ateliers Varan''' is an association of filmmakers based in [[Paris]], France, whose primary work is running non-academic hands-on courses in [[Documentary Film|documentary filmmaking]] both in France and across the world. Founded in 1981 with the spirit and support of [[Jean Rouch]], it has trained generations of documentary filmmakers in places ranging from [[Vietnam]] to [[Kenya]], [[Serbia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Afghanistan]].

Ateliers Varan acts as a consultant to [[UNESCO]] and sets up workshops abroad in collaboration with the Communication Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France. It is a member of [[CILECT]].

The name Ateliers Varan refers to the [[varanus]], the carnivorous lizard found only in Africa and Asia.

== History ==

In 1978, the newly independent [[Mozambique|Mozambican Republic]] asked famous French directors to make films about the changes occurring there. Among those was Jean Rouch, who instead offered to train the country’s future filmmakers, enabling them to film reality from the inside. Together with [[Jacques d’Arthuys]], France’s Cultural Attaché to Mozambique, he set up a documentary filmmaking workshop which would teach filmmaking through practice and collaboration.

Following that experience, the filmmakers who helped run this workshop set up an association in Paris in 1981. Their mission was to run similar courses in France and continue their activities throughout the developing world, sharing and enriching experiences.

Since its inception, Ateliers Varan have trained more than 800 filmmakers and produced more than 800 documentary films.

The '''''Bible moralisée'''''&lt;ref&gt;Also known as the "Bible Historiée", the "Bible Allégorisée" and sometimes "Emblémes Bibliques".&lt;/ref&gt; is a later name for the most important example of the medieval picture bibles, called in general "[[biblia pauperum]]", to have survived.  They are heavily illustrated, and extremely expensive, [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the thirteenth century, and from the copies that still survive it is clear that they existed in at least two versions with different contents. They were similar in the choice and order of the Biblical texts selected, but differed in the allegorical and moral deductions drawn from these passages.

Though large, the manuscripts only contained selections of the text of the Bible, along with commentary and illustrations. Each page pairs Old and New Testament episodes with illustrations explaining their moral significance in terms of [[typology (theology)|typology]].

There are seven surviving fully illustrated manuscripts of the Bible moralisée group;&lt;ref&gt;Lowden, 11,&lt;/ref&gt; all date from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries and were designed for the personal use of the French royal family.&lt;ref&gt;Greenspoon, 607&lt;/ref&gt;  Four were created in the early thirteenth century,&lt;ref name="Tachau, 7"&gt;Tachau, 7&lt;/ref&gt; when church art dominated the decorative arts. As common in [[stained glass]] and other [[Gothic art]] of the time, the illustrations are framed within medallions.&lt;ref&gt;“Gothic Art and Architecture”&lt;/ref&gt;   The text explained the theological and moral meanings of the text.&lt;ref name="Tachau, 7"/&gt;  Many artists were involved in the creation of each of the ''Bibles moralisées'', and their identities and shares of the work remain unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Lowden, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the [[European Middle Ages]] the Catholic church made use of pictures as a means of instruction, to supplement the knowledge acquired by reading or oral teaching. Books only existed in manuscript form and, being extremely costly, were beyond the means of most people. Hardly anyone could read, outside the ranks of the clergy and the monks. So [[fresco]]es of scenes from the Old and New Testaments, [[stained-glass windows]], and the like were set up in the churches, because, as the [[Synod of Arras]] (1025) said, "The illiterate contemplated in the lineaments of painting what they, having never learnt to read, could not discern in writing".

Pictures spread abroad a knowledge of the events recorded in the Bible and of the mutual connection between the leading facts of the Old and New Testaments, whether as type and [[antitype]], or as prophecy and fulfillment. For this purpose the picture Bibles of the Middle Ages were copied and put in circulation. Parts of these go back to the eleventh and twelfth centuries.

The ''Bibles moralisées'' were created to interpret and explain scripture.  A broad didactic movement in the first half of the thirteenth century was one that placed an importance on pictures teaching morality. The ''Bible moralisées'' was part of this movement and attempted to do just that.&lt;ref&gt;Cothren, 329-330&lt;/ref&gt; Both the depiction and text must be read because the images hold an interpretation of the world or moment in history, and details within the images hold symbolic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Tachau, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscripts were for private use,&lt;ref&gt;Cothren, 34&lt;/ref&gt; specifically the ''Bibles moraliées'' were designed to teach the French kings. The second of the bible manuscripts, Vienna 1179, may have been written in Latin for the purpose of teaching [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]].

This Bible, as indeed all the picture Bibles of the Middle Ages, did not contain the full text of the Bible, and contained much original commentary. Short passages only were cited, and these not so as to give any continuous sense or line of thought. But the object of the writer seems to have been chiefly to make the texts cited the basis of moral and allegorical teaching, in the manner so common in those days. In the [[Psalter]] he was content with copying out the first verse of each psalm; whilst when dealing with the [[Gospels]] he did not quote from each evangelist separately, but made use of a kind of confused [[diatessaron]] of all four combined. An attempt was made to establish a connection between the events recorded in the Old Testament and those recorded in the New, even when there does not seem to be any very obvious connection between them. Thus the sleep of [[Adam]], recorded in the beginning of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], is said to prefigure the death of Christ; and [[Abraham]] sending his servant with rich presents to seek a wife for his son is a type of the Eternal Father giving the Gospels to the [[Apostles]] to prepare the union of His Son with the Church.

The entire work contains about 5,000 illustrations. The pictures are arranged in two parallel columns on each page, each column having four medallions with pictures. Parallel to the pictures and alternating with them are two other narrower columns, with four legends each, one legend to each picture; the legends consisting alternatively of Biblical texts and moral or [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|allegorical]] applications; whilst the pictures represent the subjects of the Biblical texts or of the applications of them.  The illustrations are executed with the greatest skill. The painting is said to be one of the best specimens of thirteenth-century work and the MS. was in all probability prepared for someone in the highest rank of life. A specimen of the second edition of the "Bible Moralisée" is to be found in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] (MS. Français No. 167). Whilst it is identical with the copy which has just been examined in the selection and order of the Biblical passages, it differs from it in the greater simplicity and brevity of the moral and allegorical teaching based on them. Another important Bible, intended to instruct by means of pictures, was that which has been called the "Bible Historiée toute figurée". It was a work of the end of the thirteenth or the beginning of the fourteenth century. In general outline and plan it resembles the class of Bible which has gone before, but it differs from it in the selection of Bible passages and in the allegorical explanations derived from them. Coming to the life of Christ, the author of the "Bible Historiée toute figurée" dispensed with a written text altogether, and contented himself with writing over the pictures depicting scenes of Christ's life, a brief explanatory legend.

The article “The Iconography of Theophilus Windows in the First Half of the Thirteenth Century” by Cothren compares the ''Bibles moralisées'' with [[Theophilus of Adana|Theophilus]] Windows because both have a didactic idea to use pictures to explain ideas regarding morals as well as to juxtapose scenes from the old and new testament. The difference is that stained glass art and the Theophilus Windows are created for public viewing while the ''Bibles moralisées'' were not.&lt;ref name="test52"&gt;[Cothren, “The Iconography”, 329],&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the Theophilus Windows and the ''Bibles moralisées'' are a part of a didactic movement, wherein pictures are relied upon to teach morality.

==The Four Early ''Bibles moralisées''==
The best known copy of the first version is one of the most sumptuous illustrated manuscripts preserved to us from the Middle Ages. It no longer as a single volume; it has been split up into three separate parts kept in three libraries. The first part, consisting of 224 leaves, is in the [[Bodleian Library]] at Oxford. The second part of 222 leaves is in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris; and the third part, made up of 178 leaves, is kept in the  [[British Library]]. Six leaves of the third part are missing, so that it ought to contain 184 leaves. When complete and bound together, therefore, the whole volume consisted of 630 leaves, written and illustrated on one side only.

The Oxford-Paris-London manuscripts consist of 3 volumes and artists had left evidence in their work of working under time pressure.&lt;ref name="test13"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 154],&lt;/ref&gt;  The Oxford-Paris-London bible was the most accessible through publication for five decades in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="test14"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 139],&lt;/ref&gt;

Vienna 2554 made it to the Imperial Library in Vienna in 1783.&lt;ref name="test7"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 53],&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the most familiar of the bibles. It has a frontispiece that is one of the most reproduced images of the Middle Ages. This manuscript is the most accessible to scholars from all the ''Bibles moralisées'', this is due to an exceptional facsimile that has been published in full colour. This facsimile was published in three thousand copies at its original size in 1973. As well, the facsimile has been republished (first in 1992 and again in 1995) twice at half the size of the original. These publications have allowed the wide exchange of Vienna 2554.&lt;ref name="test8"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 11],&lt;/ref&gt;  The second of the bibles is also in Vienna, its codex is 1179, and it is less accessible than Vienna 2554 through publication.&lt;ref name="test9"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 55],&lt;/ref&gt;  Some evidence shows that Vienna 1179 was a rethought version of what was first created in Vienna 2554; this reverses the usual connection that is made between the two.&lt;ref name="test10"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 56],&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the close relations between France and Spain in the 13th century, there appeared several moralized Bibles in Spain at this time. One complete version, similar to that described above, is the [[St. Louis Bible]]. It was copied and illustrated between 1226 and 1234 in Paris on the orders of [[Blanche of Castile]] for her son [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], who gave it to [[Alfonso X of Castile]]; it remains in good condition in the [[Cathedral of Toledo]]. The three volumes are exhibited in the Cathedral Treasury, making this 3 volume bible the easiest of all the ''bibles moralisées'' for any visitor to see, but yet it was also the most difficult for a scholar to be allowed to study.&lt;ref name="test11"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 95],&lt;/ref&gt; The number of requests the cathedral Chapter received from scholars seeking direct access to the Bible of St Louis in order to study and conduct research on a great many subjects, increased every day, so eventually the Chapter decided to produce a facsimile edition of the Bible of St Louis. After approaching different publishing houses, the project was finally entrusted to M. Moleiro Editor in Barcelona and since 2006 a complete [http://www.moleiro.com/en/biblical-books/the-bible-of-st-louis.html facsimile edition] is available.

There was also the Spanish ''Biblia moralizada'' (Biblioteca nacional de Madrid 10232) from the late 14th century, which contains independently translated passages and glosses, though it has few illuminations.&lt;ref&gt;George D. Greenia, "Bible in Spain, The Moralized." ''Medieval Iberia: an encyclopedia'', E. Michael Gerli, Samuel G. Armistead, eds. Volume 8 of Routledge encyclopedias of the Middle Ages. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003. pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The later ''Bibles moralisées''==
Of the seven ''Bibles moralisées'' only one, manuscript Français 167 in the Bibliothèque nationale de France at Paris, has survived in its complete form. Français 167 can be traced almost without a break from its creation in Paris for King [[John II of France]] in 1349-52 up until now.&lt;ref name="test15"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées,221],&lt;/ref&gt;  The sixth of the ''Bibles moralisées'' is known now as MS Additional 18719 and is the least known of the seven, and is the work of well known late thirteenth-century English artist.&lt;ref name="test16"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées,189],&lt;/ref&gt;  Français 166 is the last of the seven fully illustrated ''Bibles moralisées''.&lt;ref name="test17"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 251]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date and Locations==

Historians still dispute the time, place and the intended readers of the first two bibles moralisées, though consensus seems to believe that they were created during the first three decades of the thirteenth century in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Tachau, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==The theories behind the commissioning of the ''Bibles moralisées''==

# There is no precise date for Vienna 2554, yet there is agreement that the manuscript is dated in the mid-thirteenth century, probably 1250s or 1260s. Vienna 2554 was written in approximately 1208 to 1215 in old French, it is theorized to have been commissioned by Phillip II Augustus, for his son, Louis VIII or his bride.&lt;ref name="test19"&gt;[Tachau, “God's Compass and Vana Curiositas”, 7],&lt;/ref&gt;   One expert on this subject believes this piece originated in Champagne, France.&lt;ref name="test20"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 50],&lt;/ref&gt; A point of reference for the dating of Vienna 2554 is the image of a mature looking bearded king at the end of Vienna 1179. This image was probably created before 1226 when Louis IX succeeded his father Louis VIII.&lt;ref name="test21"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 51],&lt;/ref&gt;  The date of the Vienna 1179 manuscript is close to Vienna 2554, both were made after 1219.&lt;ref name="test22"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 90],&lt;/ref&gt;
# An accepted theory regarding Toledo is that it was created on the orders of Blanche of Castile for Louis IX, this may be in connection to his marriage to Marguerite of Provence in 1234 majorite.&lt;ref name="test23"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 183],&lt;/ref&gt;
# Oxford-Paris-London was probably also created on orders of Blanche of Castile for a related circumstance during approximately the same time period. Due to the fact that organization for Louis` marriage began in 1233 this may be the time period when this manuscript was started.&lt;ref name="test24"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 185],&lt;/ref&gt;
# There is debate as to whether MS Additional 18719 (Add. 18719) was created at the end of the thirteenth century or the beginning of the fourteenth.&lt;ref name="test25"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 190],&lt;/ref&gt;
# Français 166 came to be in the royal collection by 1518, how it got there remains unknown, though it has been theorized that Aymar of Poitiers may have given manuscripts to King Charles VIII while he was serving in Provence.&lt;ref name="test26"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 284],&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Artists of the ''Bibles moralisées''==
In the ''Bibles moralisées'' all the artists who worked on the manuscripts could not be identified, at times the number of artists who worked on a manuscript could be distinguished. For example, in the Add. 18719 manuscript, the illustrations were created by a number of craftsmen with speed and sloppiness, borders are completed crudely and in freehand.&lt;ref name="test27"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 202],&lt;/ref&gt;   Meanwhile, in Français 167 fifteen artists were distinguished.&lt;ref name="test28"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 232],&lt;/ref&gt;   Français 166 is different in this regard, because some of the artists were identified. Three of the five artists of Français166 were identified, including young Master of the Psalter of Jeanne de Laval, Maitre de Jouvenel, and the Master of the Geneva Boccaccio. These artists did not work at the same time but rather picking up where the one before stopped.&lt;ref name="test29"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 279],&lt;/ref&gt;   There is a possible connection between the Limbourg brothers in 1402 -1404 and the illustrations within Français 166 first three quires.&lt;ref name="test30"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 251],&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical Analysis===
In the four early ''Bibles moralisées'', only one side of each page of parchment was used; this procedure increased the size of the volume as well as made the creation of these bibles very expensive.&lt;ref name="test36"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 13],&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the earlier ''Bibles moralisées'', Add. 18719 and other later ''Bibles moralisées'' used both sides of the parchment, hence costs as well as size of the manuscript was decreased. This change allowed for a more convenient one volume manuscript. Although this change may signal that money was a factor when creating later manuscripts.&lt;ref name="test37"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 192],&lt;/ref&gt;

The text/picture blocks in the ''Bibles Moralisées'' are striking for their symmetry. Each of the pages hold 8 medallions with painted gold backgrounds, these 8 medallions are arranged in pairs, so 4 rows of two medallions. Where the medallions touch one another a stylized flower joins the two, similar flowers mark where the medallions touch the outer frame and the spaces between the medallions are decorated using squares placed over quatrefoils, in these there are painted angel busts over a gold “ground”.&lt;ref name="test38"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 28],&lt;/ref&gt;    Each of the paintings within the medallions held figures that were painted on a gold leaf background, and are set on a patterned ground of blue or rose brown.&lt;ref&gt;Tachau, 39&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, in BnF MS Français 9561 129 pages are taken up with the Old Testament. Of these the earlier ones are divided horizontally in the centre, and it is the upper part of the page that contains the picture illustrative of some Old Testament event. The lower part represents a corresponding scene from the New Testament. further on in the volume, three pictures appear in the upper part of the page, and three below. Seventy-six pages at the end of the volume are devoted to depicting the lives of Jesus Christ and the Blessed Virgin.

In most of the ''Bibles moralisées'', evidence shows that scribes completed the text after the decorations were completed. The text supplemented the images, being similar to a caption. This can be seen most obviously where the text goes over the gilding or the borders that had been painted for the text to fit in.&lt;ref name="test40"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 30],&lt;/ref&gt;  A difference between MS Additional 18719 and the earlier ''Bibles moralisées'' is that MS Additional 18719 (and Add.18719) followed the usual procedure for manuscript illumination, where the scribes worked first and then the artists added images.&lt;ref name="test41"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 199],&lt;/ref&gt;

Français 166 copies the layout and text that is used in Français 167.  Meanwhile, Vienna 1179 and Toledo are very similar, at times the two be told apart in photographs, since they consist of the same layout.&lt;ref name="test62"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the bibles moralisées, p.96],&lt;/ref&gt;   Français 167 is similar to Add. 18719 in that unlike the other ''Bibles moralisées''  they both sides of the parchment sheets.&lt;ref name="test63"/&gt;

===State of Preservation===
Almost all of the manuscripts dated to the medieval period have been rebound. For example, Add. 18719 was rebound in modern times the stitching of the new binding is characteristic of the tight stitch technique that was used by the British Museum in the second half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="test42"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 191],&lt;/ref&gt;

Vienna 1179 was badly damaged by water at an early date; the damage was not equal to all pages but sufficient to require the rewriting of all the texts positioned in the upper part of the affected pages. This rewriting can be witnessed in that the scribe who restored the texts on Ruth was not the original scribe, his work was not angular and appeared more the inscriptions used in Toledo pr Oxford-Paris London, two other bibles of the ''bibles moralisées'', hence this damage was caused after the manuscript was completed.&lt;ref name="test43"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 57],&lt;/ref&gt;

Français 167 went through an early restoration, due to extensive water damage. Three sides of the parchment leaves had been cut off in the majority of the book and replacements strips were glued on, also the text was inked again in certain places that had been affected by the replacement strips. The images that were replaced were created to imitate the originals and have been identified as having been completed by a master working for King Charles V around 1370-1380.&lt;ref name="test44"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 236],&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the parts of Français 166 that survived were never fully completed.&lt;ref name="test45"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 255],&lt;/ref&gt;  All the aspects of Français 166, such as the headers, drawing of the frames, paintings etc., are all in different stages of completion at different points in the manuscript.&lt;ref name="test46"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées,258],&lt;/ref&gt;  Add. 18719 was entirely illustrated using drawings, this brings up questions about whether it was left unfinished.&lt;ref name="test47"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 215],&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style===
One of the artist who illustrated Add. 18719, identified only as artist E, used exceptional skills in his drawings. His figures were tall and thin with elongated necks. The figures are clothed in drapery that hangs and shows heavy angular folds. The heads sit at odd angles on the necks, often tilted sharply. The figures have broad foreheads and small chins. This artist’s work was compared to the Ashridge Comestor, British Library, MS Royal 3.D.VI, which is a different manuscript.&lt;ref name="test48"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 209],&lt;/ref&gt;  The style used by artist E is reminiscent of the Carolingian Rheims School of art. The Rheims school also used elongated figures, with long necks and figures. The heads of some of the sketches also sit peculiarly on the shoulders and draperies in which the figures are clothed also have angular folds. The Rheims school of art produced art that gave much feeling of motion.

The early Bibles moralisées are an example of the move away from the Byzantine influences, this movement is part of the early gothic art movement. The early gothic style lasted until the middle of the thirteenth century and is characterized by a softer and more realistic style than the Byzantine influenced style. “In France the style is particularly noticeable in a series of magnificent Bibles Moralisées ... done probably for the French court c. 1230–40.”&lt;ref name="test49"&gt;[Martindale, Early Gothic],&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iconography===
The Vienna 2554 frontispiece is famous and has often been reproduced. This frontispiece shows God`s figure bent while in the work of creation. “There is no close iconographic antecedent for this image.” In this image God is utilizing a huge pair of compasses, which are carefully balanced so as to draw and define. God’s left hand seems to be in the process of putting the disk that is the cosmos into motion. In a broadly read study of Gothic architecture by Otto Von Simpson, this image is titled “The Creator as Architect,” this theme has been important from Plato and onward. Yet the meaning of this frontispiece has been widely debated.&lt;ref name="test50"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 47],&lt;/ref&gt;  Vienna 1179 also has a full page creator image. In this image God is seated on a backless throne and he is holding the orb of the universe in his lap. With his right hand he turns the compasses. In this image he is enclosed within a rectangular frame by a mandorla supported at the corners by four flying angels.&lt;ref name="test51"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 87],&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea of god as a creator, with images of god holding compasses has been reproduced in several of the Bibles moralisées and many debates have surrounded the meaning and origin of this idea.

===Codicological Information===

The ''Bibles moralisées'' were created on high quality parchment paper. Each of the bibles was one of the most expensive books that had been created within medieval Europe. All of the bibles were created on large sheets of high- quality parchment in which the work was only done on one side of each parchment.&lt;ref name="test54"&gt;[Tachau, “God's Compass and Vana Curiositas”, p.9],&lt;/ref&gt;  Expensive paint and ink was used in the creation of the ''Bibles moralisées'' as well, for example the blue that was used for the borders, backgrounds, and clothes was lapis lazuli. Few held the resources to commission these works other than royalty.&lt;ref name="test54"/&gt;  In each page of the ''Bibles moralisées'' there are eight images arranged within four columns. Each is a biblical and moralizing image that is accompanied by a text. Unlike most illuminated manuscripts where the images are secondary to the text, in these manuscripts the images are the dominant aspect, this is evident in that the manuscripts contain more than 24, 000 illustrations.&lt;ref name="test55"&gt;[Greenspoon, “The Making of the Bibles Moralisees”, p.607],&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folios==

Vienna 2554 now stands apart from the other ''Bibles moralisées'' as noticeably the smallest, consisting of 131 folios.&lt;ref name="test56"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the bibles moralisées, p.12],&lt;/ref&gt;  The damage and disorder of the pages now leave little evidence of the original length of the volume.&lt;ref name="test57"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the bibles moralisées, p.22],&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, Vienna 1179 is almost two times the thickness of Vienna 2554, consisting of 246 folios.&lt;ref name="test58"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the bibles moralisées, p.58],&lt;/ref&gt;  MS Additional 18719 now consists of 311 folios, while the original total was 321 folios and 642 pages.&lt;ref name="test59"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the bibles moralisées, p.197],&lt;/ref&gt;  Français 167 is a single volume and it contains 322 numbered folios.&lt;ref name="test63"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the bibles moralisées, p.222],&lt;/ref&gt;   Lastly, Français 166 consists of one volume and 169 folios, containing 1,340 illustrations.&lt;ref name="test61"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the bibles moralisées, p.252],&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other illustrated Bibles==
There is a MS. existing in the British Museum (addit. 1577) entitled "Figures de la Bible" consisting of pictures illustrating events in the Bible with short descriptive text. This is of the end of the thirteenth, or the beginning of the fourteenth, century. Of the same date is the "Historia Bibliæ metrice" which is preserved in the same library and, as the name implies, has a metrical text. The [[Velislai biblia picta]] is a 14th-century [[Bohemian]]n picture bible.

There are specimens of manuscript illustrated Bibles of earlier date. Examples are the Bible preserved in the library of the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], Rome; that of the Amiens Library (MS. 108), and that of the Royal Library of The Hague (MS. 69).

'''''Bloomington''''' is a 2010 coming-of-age drama film about a former [[child actress]] (Sarah Stouffer) attending college in search of independence and who ends up becoming romantically involved with a professor, played by [[Allison McAtee]].

==Plot summary==
Jackie Kirk, a former child actress, catches the eye of an infamous, predatory lesbian teacher, named Catherine Stark ([[Allison McAtee|McAtee]]), when Jackie attends college in Bloomington, Indiana. Jackie attempts to fit in with her fellow students, who are in awe of her acting background. After meeting at an on-campus mixer, Catherine and Jackie begin a secret and scandalous affair that draws Jackie away from the college social life. Catherine and Jackie grow closer as they help each other discover more about themselves, when suddenly Jackie gets the chance to return to acting. Catherine becomes uncomfortable with their situation, seeing how it could seemingly never work out, with Jackie having to constantly visit Catherine under the guise of her just being a "friend," as it would be hazardous for both of them for should their romance ever got out.

Catherine attempts to distance herself from Jackie by trying to declare they were never in a formal relationship, and that Jackie is not worth it in Catherine's eyes, while Jackie claims Catherine is worth it. Jackie, at odds with her friends, gets into a fight with Sandy (Erika Heidewald), jealous that Jackie is competing for a scholarship she doesn't need and angry that Jackie's affair with a teacher means she gets preferential treatment. Jackie slaps Sandy, who punches her in the face. The next day Jackie shows up at Catherine's doorstep with a black eye. Catherine sees paparazzi taking pictures and quickly drags Jackie into the house. While Catherine is taking care of Jackie, she notices Catherine is wearing a dress. When questioned about it, she reveals she is attending a party, Jackie asks if she is going alone, Catherine says no but will not reveal her date, and will not let Jackie replace her date, claiming she would just be attention starved; Jackie offends Catherine by insulting her for not being financed by her own means.

Jackie stays on the couch at Catherine's house when Catherine returns from the party, acting passive-aggressive towards Jackie, she brings her date, a male closer to her age, into her room, causing Jackie to leave. Jackie goes to a party and hangs out with friends and flirts with a male friend, Zach (Ray Zupp). After leaving for L.A. to film the movie version of Jackie's old show, Catherine loses her job due to her relationship with Jackie being partially exposed.

Months later, Jackie and Catherine are shown sleeping together one last time. Saying their goodbyes as a formal end to their romance, Jackie leaves the next day for her new role back in California.

'''''Born in Flames''''' is a 1983 [[Documentary film|documentary]]-style [[feminist]] [[fiction film]] by [[Lizzie Borden (director)|Lizzie Borden]] that explores [[racism]], [[classism]], [[sexism]], and [[heterosexism]] in an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternative]] United States [[Democratic socialism|socialist democracy]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D03E3DE1539F933A25752C1A965948260|title=Born in Flames (1983) FILM: 'BORN IN FLAMES,' RADICAL FEMINIST IDEAS|authorlink=Janet Maslin|first=Janet|last=Maslin|date=November 10, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title comes from the song ''Born in Flames'' written by a member of [[Art &amp; Language]], [[Mayo Thompson]] of the band [[Red Krayola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/filmmaker-lizzie-borden-talks-about-her-scrappy-dystopian-magnum-opus/Content?oid=2788668|title=Lizzie Borden talks about her scrappy, feminist magnum opus, 'Born in Flames'|last=Baise|first=Greg|website=Detroit Metro Times|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

The plot concerns two feminist groups in New York City, each voicing their concerns to the public by [[pirate radio]]. One group, led by an outspoken white lesbian, Isabel ([[Adele Bertei]]), operates "Radio Ragazza". The other group, led by a soft-spoken African-American, Honey (Honey), operates "Phoenix Radio." The local community is stimulated into action after a world-traveling political activist, Adelaide Norris (Jean Satterfield), is arrested upon arriving at a New York City airport, and suspiciously dies while in [[police custody]]. Also, there is a Women's Army led by Hilary Hurst (Hilary Hurst) and advised by Zella ([[Florynce Kennedy|Flo Kennedy]]) that initially both Honey and Isabel refuse to join. This group, along with Norris and the radio stations, are under investigation by a callous FBI agent ([[Ron Vawter]]). Their progress is tracked by three editors ([[Becky Johnston]], [[Pat Murphy (director)|Pat Murphy]], [[Kathryn Bigelow]]) for a socialist newspaper, who go so far they get fired.

The story involves several different women coming from different perspectives and attempts to show several examples of how sexism plays out on the street, and how it can be dealt with through [[direct action]]. At one point, two men attack a woman on the street, and dozens of women on bicycles with whistles come to chase the men away and comfort the woman. The movie shows women, despite their various differences, organizing in meetings, doing radio shows, creating art, [[wheatpasting]], putting a [[condom]] on a [[human penis|penis]], wrapping raw chicken at a processing plant, etc. The film portrays a world rife with violence against women, high female unemployment, and government oppression. The women in the film start to come together to make a bigger impact, by means that some would call [[terrorism]].

Ultimately, after both radio stations are suspiciously burned down, Honey and Isabel team up and broadcast "Phoenix Ragazza Radio" from stolen [[U-Haul]] vans. They also join the Women's Army, which sends a group of terrorists to interrupt a broadcast of the [[President of the United States]] proposing that women be paid to do [[Homemaking|housework]], followed by bombing the antenna on top of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] to prevent additional such destructive messages from the mainstream.

==Reception==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that nine of twelve reviews were positive; the average rating is 6.8/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/born_in_flames/|title=Born in Flames  (1983)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that it has "all the advantages and the disadvantages of a home movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1982/film/reviews/born-in-flames-1200425584/|title=Review: 'Born in Flames'|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|year=1984|accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "Only those who already share Miss Borden's ideas are apt to find her film persuasive."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  Marjorie Baumgarten of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' wrote, "Beautifully made, courageously edited, and swift-moving, this challenging, provocative film is a work that is both humanist and revolutionary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/2001-06-20/141222/|title=Born in Flames|last=Baumgarten|first=Marjorie|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|date=2001-06-20|accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frances Dickinson of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out London]]'' wrote that Borden "[handles] her story with audacity and make[s] even the driest argument crackle with humour, while the more poignant moments burn with a fierce white heat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/born-in-flames|title=Born in Flames|last=Dickinson|first=Frances|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out London]]|accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[TV Guide]]'' rated it 2/4 stars and wrote, "This feminist film wins laurels for close attention to detail in a radical filmmaking effort."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/born-in-flames/review/118362/|title=Born In Flames|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Greg Baise of the ''[[Metro Times]]'' called it "an early '80s landmark of indie and queer cinema".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metrotimes.com/Blogs/archives/2010/06/16/born-in-flames|title=Born in Flames|last=Baise|first=Greg|work=[[Metro Times]]|date=2010-06-16|accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has had experienced somewhat of a renaissance after the 35mm restoration print premiered in 2016 at the Anthology Film Archives. Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote, "...the free, ardent, spontaneous creativity of “Born in Flames” emerges as an indispensable mode of radical change—one that many contemporary filmmakers with political intentions have yet to assimilate." He also wrote, "Borden's exhilarating collage-like story stages news reports, documentary sequences, and surveillance footage alongside tough action scenes and musical numbers; her violent vision is both ideologically complex and chilling." Melissa Anderson of The Village Voice wrote "this unruly, unclassifiable film — perhaps the sole entry in the hybrid genre of radical-lesbian-feminist sci-fi vérité — premiered two years into the Reagan regime, but its fury proves as bracing today as it was back when this country began its inexorable shift to the right."

* There is also a reference to [[wages for housework]], a feminist social movement from the seventies addressing women's reproductive labor, in a scene in which the president announces on TV that “For the first time in our history we’ll provide women with wages for housework”, just before a group of women hijack the broadcast to pass a militant message.

==Influence==
The film is discussed in [[Christina Lane]]'s book ''Feminist Hollywood: From "Born in Flames" to "Point Break"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133947283.html|title=Feminist Hollywood: From Born in Flames to Point Break.(Book Review)|last=Kessler|first=Kelly|work=[[Velvet Light Trap]]|date=2001-03-22|accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A “graphic translation” of the movie made by artist Kaisa Lassinaro, which contains an interview of Lizzie Borden, was published by Occasional Papers in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Born in Flames, Occasional Papers, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-9562605-9-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is a collage composition made of screencaps with a selection of dialogues from the movie.

In 2013, a dossier on the film was published as a special issue of Women &amp; Performance: A Journal of Feminist Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory - Volume 23, Issue 1|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rwap20/23/1|website = www.tandfonline.com|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an introduction from Craig Willse and Dean Spade, the dossier includes a number of essays that address race, queerness, intersectionality, radicalism, violence, and feminism in the film.

The film was restored in 2016 by [[Anthology Film Archives]]. The 35mm restoration film premiered in Feb. 2016 at the Anthology. It was very well received, with glowing reviews, from Richard Brody in New Yorker.com, The Political Science Fiction of “Born in Flames” and from many other journalists, including Melissa Anderson in The Village Voice.  Borden was invited to show the new 35mm print in Brussels, Barcelona, Madrid, San Sebastian, Milan, Toronto, The Edinburgh Film Festival, The London Film Festival, along with screenings in Detroit, Rochester, San Francisco, Los Angeles and including in series of "films of resistance."

'''Cardiff School of Art &amp; Design''' (CSAD) is one of the five schools that comprise [[Cardiff Metropolitan University]]. It originated as the Cardiff School of Art in 1865.

==History==
Cardiff School of Art &amp; Design opened in 1865 as the Cardiff School of Science &amp; Art&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiffmet.ac.uk/alumni/Pages/Our-History.aspx |title=The History of Cardiff Metropolitan University  |publisher=CMU |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with lessons initially taking place on the top floor of the Cardiff Free Library and Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SScGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=%22Milo+ap+Griffith%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TrNoVPnyFNPhaIeHgPgH&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Milo%20ap%20Griffith%22&amp;f=false |title=Sixth Annual Report 1867&amp;ndash;68 |publisher=Cardiff Free Library and Museum and Science and Art Schools |date=1868 |page=7 |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867 a distinct School of Art was formed, based on the Art Night School, with 65 young pupils aged between 9 and 17. In 1868 an older intake was accepted, of 50 'artisan' students between 17 and 25 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SScGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=%22Milo+ap+Griffith%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TrNoVPnyFNPhaIeHgPgH&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Milo%20ap%20Griffith%22&amp;f=false |title=Sixth Annual Report 1867&amp;ndash;68 |chapter=The Headmaster's Report |publisher=Cardiff Free Library and Museum and Science and Art Schools |date=1868 |pages=13–14 |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, a new six-storey campus was built in Howard Gardens, Cardiff, with large studios facing north. The building was designed by the Cardiff City Architect, John Dryburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Newman |first1=John |title=The Buildings of Wales: Glamorgan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpUMspCtpNIC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=%22Howard+gardens%22+gallery+cardiff&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NhfLUs34K8yh7AbS4oAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Howard%20gardens%22%20gallery%20cardiff&amp;f=false |place= |publisher=Penguin Books |page=306 |year=2001 |isbn=0-14-071056-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School merged with other colleges in 1976 to become part of South Glamorgan Institute of Higher Education (later Cardiff Institute of Higher Education and the University of Wales Institute Cardiff).&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; It is the oldest constituent part of Cardiff Metropolitan University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/into-university/az-uni-colleges/cardiff-university-of-wales-institute-458889.html |title=

==About CSAD==
Cardiff School of Art &amp; Design was assessed as one of the top 40 destinations to study art and design in the UK by guardian.co.uk in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2010/jun/04/university-guide-art-and-design ''Guardian'' League Tables]&lt;/ref&gt;

CSAD has thirteen 'Subject' areas:  Animation, Architectural Studies, Ceramics, Fashion Design, Fine Art, Graphic Communication, Illustration, Interior Design, International Design, Photographic Practice, Product Design, Textiles and an ideas, histories and theories subject area called Constellation. 

All of its 'Subjects' can be studied at undergraduate, (BA/BSc) postgraduate (MA/MDes/MFA/MSc) and at research degree level (PhD) or Professional Doctorate (PDoc). 

CSAD has a number of partner colleges who deliver its Art &amp; Design Foundation Diploma, HNCs, Foundation Degrees and a further BA on its behalf as well as close links with Ffotogallery, Cardiff and Cardiff University Medical School. It has research affiliations and study exchange agreements with numerous other UK, EU and International Universities. 

CSAD is affiliated with the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]], [[European University Association]], and [[University Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4icu.org/reviews/4822.htm|title=University of Wales Institute, Cardiff|publisher=4International Colleges and Universities|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The school's Art and Design research is conducted through the [[WIRAD|Wales Institute for Research in Art and Design (WIRAD)]]. In the 2008 [[Research Assessment Exercise]] the Art &amp; Design panel rated 95% of the research submission as international standard, with 70% rated as either Internationally Excellent or World Leading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csad.uwic.ac.uk/csad/research.htm Research areas &amp; RAE assessment results]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is home to a number of highly regarded international standard research groups which range across the humanities, art, design and sciences as well as the Centre for [[Ceramic]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artcolleges/InfoAll/introduction/ac_id/62|title=Introduction - Cardiff School of Art and Design|publisher=saatchi-gallery.co.uk|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cardiff Open Art School==
The Cardiff Open Art School (COAS) is part of the School, and runs classes in [[photography]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[life drawing]], [[printmaking]] and several other disciplines for part-time students in the Cardiff area in particular through the School's relationship with FFotogallery, Cardiff.

==Awards==
In June 2010, the CSAD Summer Degree Show was voted the best in the UK for painting by ''Artists and Illustrators'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/ June 2010 issue]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, CSAD won both a HEIST bronze award and a best publication award at the Association of Commonwealth Universities Annual Marketing and Communications awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.uwic.ac.uk/English/News/Pages/180509award.aspx Press Release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705192601/http://www3.uwic.ac.uk/English/News/Pages/180509award.aspx |date=5 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Celtic art''' is associated with the peoples known as [[Celts]]; those who spoke the [[Celtic languages]] in [[Europe]] from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages.

Celtic art is a difficult term to define, covering a huge expanse of time, geography and cultures. A case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the [[Bronze Age]], and indeed the preceding [[Neolithic age]]; however archaeologists generally use "Celtic" to refer to the culture of the [[European Iron Age]] from around 1000 BC onwards, until the conquest by the Roman Empire of most of the territory concerned, and art historians typically begin to talk about "Celtic art" only from the [[La Tène]] period (broadly 5th to 1st centuries BC) onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws, for example; see their introductory section, where they explain the situation &amp; that their article will only cover the La Tène period.&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Early Celtic art''' is another term used for this period, stretching in Britain to about 150 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/project_archive/technologies_of_enchantment.aspx |title=Technologies of Enchantment: Early Celtic Art in Britain |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804214909/http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/project_archive/technologies_of_enchantment.aspx |archive-date=2012-08-04 |publisher=[[British Museum]]}} It is also used by Jacobsthal; however the equivalent "Late Celtic art" for Early Medieval work is much rarer, and "Late Celtic art" can also mean the later part of the prehistoric period.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Early Medieval]] art of Britain and Ireland, which produced the [[Book of Kells]] and other masterpieces, and is what "Celtic art" evokes for much of the general public in the English-speaking world, is called [[Insular art]] in art history.  This is the best-known part, but not the whole of, the Celtic art of the Early Middle Ages, which also includes the Pictish art of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Laings, 6-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Both styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources, but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects, which are often extremely stylised when they do appear; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws&lt;/ref&gt;  Energetic circular forms, [[triskele]]s and spirals are characteristic.  Much of the surviving material is in precious metal, which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture, but apart from [[Pictish stones]] and the Insular [[high crosses]], large [[monumental sculpture]], even with decorative carving, is very rare; possibly the few standing male figures found, like the [[Warrior of Hirschlanden]] and the so-called [[Glauberg#The Keltenf.C3.BCrst .28Celtic Prince.29 of Glauberg .E2.80.93 Germany.27s oldest monumental sculpture.3F|"Lord of Glauberg"]], were originally common in wood.

Also covered by the term is the visual art of the [[Celtic Revival]] (on the whole more notable for literature) from the 18th century to the modern era, which began as a conscious effort by [[Modern Celts]], mostly in the British Isles, to express self-identification and [[nationalism]], and became popular well beyond the [[Celtic nations]], and whose style is still current in various popular forms, from [[Celtic cross]] [[funerary art|funerary monuments]] to interlace [[tattoo]]s.  Coinciding with the beginnings of a coherent archaeological understanding of the earlier periods, the style self-consciously used motifs closely copied from works of the earlier periods, more often the Insular than the Iron Age.  Another influence was that of late La Tène "vegetal" art on the [[Art Nouveau]] movement.

Typically, Celtic art is ornamental, avoiding straight lines and only occasionally using symmetry, without the imitation of nature central to the [[Classicism|classical]] tradition, often involving complex symbolism. Celtic art has used a variety of styles and has shown influences from other cultures in their knotwork, spirals, key patterns, lettering, zoomorphics, plant forms and human figures. As the archaeologist Catherine Johns put it: "Common to Celtic art over a wide chronological and geographical span is an exquisite sense of balance in the layout and development of patterns. Curvilinear forms are set out so that positive and negative, filled areas and spaces form a harmonious whole. Control and restraint were exercised in the use of surface texturing and relief. Very complex curvilinear patterns were designed to cover  precisely the most awkward and irregularly shaped surfaces".&lt;ref&gt;Johns, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The ancient peoples now called "Celts" spoke a group of languages that had a common origin in the Indo-European language known as Common Celtic or Proto-Celtic. This shared linguistic origin was once widely accepted by scholars to indicate peoples with a common genetic origin in southwest Europe, who had spread their culture by emigration and invasion. Archaeologists identified various cultural traits of these peoples, including styles of art, and traced the culture to the earlier [[Hallstatt culture]] and [[La Tène culture]]. More recent genetic studies have indicated that various Celtic groups do not all have shared ancestry, and have suggested a diffusion and spread of the culture without necessarily involving significant movement of peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, Brian "Saxons, Vikings, and Celts" (2008) W.W. Norton &amp; Co. NY, pp.&amp;nbsp;281–284.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which "Celtic" language, culture and genetics coincided and interacted during prehistoric periods remains very uncertain and controversial.

Celtic art is associated with the peoples known as Celts; those who spoke the Celtic languages in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages.

The term "Celt" was used in classical times as a synonym for the [[Gauls]] (Κελτοι, ''Celtae''). Its English form is modern, attested from 1607. In the late 17th century the work of scholars such as [[Edward Lhuyd]] brought academic attention to the historic links between Gaulish and the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]]—and [[Goidelic]]—speaking peoples, from which point the term was applied not just to continental Celts but those in Britain and Ireland.
Then in the 18th century the interest in "[[primitivism]]", which led to the idea of the "[[noble savage]]", brought a wave of enthusiasm for all things Celtic and [[Druid]]ic. The "Irish revival" came after the ''[[Catholic Emancipation]] Act of 1829'' as a conscious attempt to demonstrate an Irish national identity, and with its counterpart in other countries subsequently became the "[[Celtic Revival]]".

==Pre-Celtic periods==
The earliest archaeological culture that is conventionally termed Celtic, the Hallstatt culture, comes from the early European Iron Age, ca. 800-450 BC.  Nonetheless the art of this and later periods reflects considerable continuity, and some long-term correspondences, with earlier art from the same regions, which may reflect the emphasis in recent scholarship on "Celticization" by acculturation among a relatively static population, as opposed to older theories of migrations and invasions.  [[Megalithic art]] across much of the world uses a similar mysterious vocabulary of circles, spirals and other curved shapes, but it is striking that the most numerous remains in Europe are the large monuments, with many [[rock drawings]] left by the [[Neolithic]] [[Brú na Bóinne|Boyne Valley culture]] in Ireland, within a few miles of centres for Early Medieval Insular art some 4,000 years later.  Other centres such as [[Brittany]] are also in areas that remain defined as Celtic today.  Other correspondences are between the [[gold lunula]]s and large collars of [[Bronze Age]] Ireland and Europe and the [[torc]]s of Iron Age Celts, all elaborate ornaments worn round the neck.  The trumpet shaped terminations of various types of Bronze Age Irish jewellery are also reminiscent of motifs popular in later Celtic decoration.

==Iron Age; Early Celtic art==
[[File:Stone sculpture of celtic hero.jpg|thumb|[[Mšecké Žehrovice Head|Stone head from Mšecké Žehrovice]], Czech Republic, wearing a [[torc]], late La Tène culture]]
Unlike the rural culture of Iron Age inhabitants of the modern "Celtic nations", Continental Celtic culture in the Iron Age featured many large fortified settlements, some very large, for which the Roman word for "town", [[oppidum]], is now used.  The elites of these societies had considerable wealth, and imported large and expensive, sometimes frankly flashy, objects from neighbouring cultures, some of which have been recovered from graves.  The work of the German émigré to Oxford, [[Paul Jacobsthal]], remains the foundation of the study of the art of the period, especially his ''Early Celtic Art'' of 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Raftery, 184-185; for a preview or summary, see Jacobsthal (1935), and for a long summary in a review see Hawkes.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Halstatt culture produced art with geometric ornament, but marked by patterns of straight lines and rectangles rather than curves; the patterning is often intricate, and fills all the space available, and at least in this respect looks forward to later Celtic styles.  Linguists are generally satisfied that the Halstatt culture originated among people speaking Celtic languages, but art historians often avoid describing Halstatt art as "Celtic".

As Halstatt society became increasingly rich and, despite being entirely land-locked in its main zone, linked by trade to other cultures, especially in the Mediterranean, imported objects in radically different styles begin to appear, even including Chinese silks. A famous example is the Greek [[krater]] from the [[Vix Grave]] in [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]], which was made in [[Magna Graecia]] (the Greek south of Italy) c. 530 BC, some decades before it was deposited.  It is a huge bronze wine-mixing vessel, with a capacity of 1,100 litres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-vix.fr/fr/index.php?page=38 Le Musée du Pays Châtillonnais] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230222/http://www.musee-vix.fr/fr/index.php?page=38 |date=2016-03-03 }} Vix Krater (in French).&lt;/ref&gt;  Another huge Greek vessel in the [[Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave]] is decorated with three recumbent lions lying on the rim, one of which is a replacement by a Celtic artist that makes little attempt to copy the Greek style of the others.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman&lt;/ref&gt;  Forms characteristic of Hallstatt culture can be found as far from the main Central European area of the culture as Ireland, but mixed with local types and styles.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 125-126&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Roquepertuse-Guerriers.jpg|thumb|left|Sculpture from [[Roquepertuse]], including "skull-niches" and seated figures]]

Figures of animals and humans do appear, especially in works with a religious element. Among the most spectacular objects are "cult wagons" in bronze, which are large wheeled trolleys containing crowded groups of standing figures, sometimes with a large bowl mounted on a shaft at the centre of the platform, probably for offerings to gods; a few examples have been found in graves. The figures are relatively simply modelled, without much success in detailed anatomical naturalism compared to cultures further south, but often achieving an impressive effect.  There are also a number of single stone figures, often with a "leaf crown" — two flattish rounded projections, "resembling a pair of bloated commas", rising behind and to the side of the head, probably a sign of divinity.&lt;ref name="Raftery, 186"&gt;Raftery, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

Human heads alone, without bodies, are far more common, frequently appearing in relief on all sorts of objects. In the La Tène period faces often (along with bird's heads) emerge from decoration that at first looks abstract, or plant-based.  Games are played with faces that change when they are viewed from different directions.  In figures showing the whole body, the head is often over-large.  There is evidence that the human head had a special importance in Celtic religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 121-126, 138-142&lt;/ref&gt;

The most elaborate ensembles of stone sculpture, including [[relief]]s, come from southern France, at [[Roquepertuse]] and [[Entremont (oppidum)|Entremont]], close to areas colonized by the Greeks. It is possible that similar groups in wood were widespread. Roquepertuse seems to have been a religious sanctuary, whose stonework includes what are thought to have been niches where the heads or skulls of enemies were placed.  These are dated to the 3rd century BC, or sometimes earlier.

In general, the number of high-quality finds is not large, especially when compared to the number of survivals from the contemporary Mediterranean cultures, and there is a very clear division between elite objects and the much plainer goods used by the majority of the people.  There are many torcs and swords (the La Tène site produced over 3,000 swords, apparently votive offerings&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/l/la_t%C3%A8ne.aspx British Museum highlights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221406/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/l/la_t%C3%A8ne.aspx |date=2015-09-23 }}, La Tène&lt;/ref&gt;), but the best-known finds, like the Czech head above, the shoe plaques from Hochdorf and the [[Waterloo Helmet]], often have no similar other finds for comparison.  Clearly religious content in art is rare, but little is known about the significance that most of the decoration of practical objects had for its makers, and the subject and meaning of the few objects without a practical function is equally unclear.

[[File:Gold torque 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Torc]] from the [[Vix Grave]], 480 BC]]
About 500 BC the [[La Tène]] style, named after a site in Switzerland, appeared rather suddenly, coinciding with some kind of societal upheaval that involved a shift of the major centres in a north-westerly direction.  The central area where rich sites are especially found is in northern France and western Germany, but over the next three centuries the style spread very widely, as far as Ireland, Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/mefr_0223-5102_1996_num_108_2_1954|title=Manufatti in ferro di tipo La Tène in area italiana : le potenzialità non sfruttate}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modern Hungary.  In some places the Celts were aggressive raiders and invaders, but elsewhere the spread of Celtic material culture may have involved only small movements of people, or none at all.  Early La Tène style adapted ornamental motifs from foreign cultures into something distinctly new; the complicated brew of influences including [[Scythian art]] and that of the Greeks and [[Etruscan art|Etruscans]] among others. The occupation by the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] of [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] around 500 BC is a factor of uncertain importance.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 226-233; Laings, 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;  La Tène style is "a highly stylised curvilinear art based mainly on classical vegetable and foliage motifs such as leafy palmette forms, vines, tendrils and lotus flowers together with spirals, S-scrolls, lyre and trumpet shapes".&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 126&lt;/ref&gt;

The most lavish objects, whose imperishable materials tend to mean they are the best preserved other than pottery, do not refute the stereotypical views of the Celts that are found in classical authors, where they are represented as mainly interested in feasting and fighting, as well as ostentatious display.  Society was dominated by a warrior aristocracy and military equipment, even if in ceremonial versions, and containers for drink, represent most of the largest and most spectacular finds, other than jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Chapters 2 and 3&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for the archaeologist, the rich "princely" burials characteristic of the Hallstatt period greatly reduce, at least partly because of a change from [[inhumation]] burials to [[cremation]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, 21-26; 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[torc]] was evidently a key marker of status and very widely worn, in a range of metals no doubt reflecting the wealth and status of the owner.  Bracelets and armlets were also common.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 72-79&lt;/ref&gt;  An exception to the general lack of depictions of the human figure, and of the failure of wooden objects to survive, are certain water sites from which large numbers of small carved figures of body parts or whole human figures have been recovered, which are assumed to be votive offerings representing the location of the ailment of the supplicant.  The largest of these, at Source-de-la-Roche, [[Chamalières]], France, produced over 10,000 fragments, mostly now at [[Clermont-Ferrand]].&lt;ref&gt;Megaws; in the [[Musée Bargoin]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Couvercle bronze gaulois - La Fosse Cotheret (Val d'Oise).jpg|thumb|left|Bronze fitting from France in the "vegetal" style]]

Several phases of the style are distinguished, under a variety of names, including numeric (De Navarro) and alphabetic series. Generally, there is broad agreement on how to demarcate the phases, but the names used differ, and that they followed each other in chronological sequence is now much less certain.  In a version of Jacobsthal's division, the "early" or "strict" phase, De Navarro I, where the imported motifs remain recognisable, is succeeded by the "vegetal", "Continuous Vegetal", "[[Waldalgesheim style]]", or De Navarro II, where ornament is "typically dominated by continuously moving tendrils of various types, twisting and turning in restless motion across the surface".&lt;ref name="Raftery, 186"/&gt;

After about 300 BC the style, now De Navarro III, can be divided into "plastic" and "sword" styles, the latter mainly found on [[scabbard]]s and the former featuring decoration in high [[relief]].  One scholar, Vincent Megaw, has defined a "[[Disney]] style" of cartoon-like animal heads within the plastic style, and also an "Oppida period art, c 125–c 50 BC".  De Navarro distinguishes the "insular" art of the British Isles, up to about 100 BC, as Style IV, followed by a Style V,&lt;ref&gt;Megaws (Oppida period); Megaw and Megaw, 10-11, with more detail on these schemes; Laings, 41-42, 94-95; also see Harding, 119&lt;/ref&gt; and the separateness of Insular Celtic styles is widely recognised.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 233 and Chapter 9; Laings, 94&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Britishmuseumsnettishamgreattorc.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Great Torc from Snettisham]], England, 1st century BC.]]

The often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other "foreign" styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic.  So a torc in the rich [[Vix Grave]] terminates in large balls in a way found in many others, but here the ends of the ring are formed as the paws of a lion or similar beast, without making a logical connection to the balls, and on the outside of the ring two tiny winged horses sit on finely worked plaques. The effect is impressive but somewhat incongruous compared to an equally ostentatious British torc from the [[Snettisham Hoard]] that is made 400 years later and uses a style that has matured and harmonized the elements making it up.  The 1st century BC [[Gundestrup cauldron]], is the largest surviving piece of European Iron Age silver (diameter 69&amp;nbsp;cm, height 42&amp;nbsp;cm), but though much of its [[iconography]] seems clearly to be Celtic, much of it is not, and its style is much debated; it may well be of [[Thracian]] manufacture.  To further confuse matters, it was found in a bog in north Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist, A K &amp; Taylor, T F (1987), “The origin of the Gundestrup cauldron”, ''Antiquity 61'': 10-24&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Agris Helmet]] in gold leaf over bronze clearly shows the Mediterranean origin of its decorative motifs.

By the 3rd century BC Celts began to produce coinage, imitating Greek and later Roman types, at first fairly closely, but gradually allowing their own taste to take over, so that versions based on sober classical heads sprout huge wavy masses of hair several times larger than their faces, and horses become formed of a series of vigorously curved elements.

A form apparently unique to southern Britain was the mirror with a handle and complex decoration, mostly engraved, on the back of the bronze plate; the front side being highly polished to act as the mirror. Each of the more than 50 mirrors found has a unique design, but the essentially circular shape of the mirror presumably dictated the sophisticated abstract curvilinear motifs that dominate their decoration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celticmirrors.org/ Celtic mirrors website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126064442/http://celticmirrors.org/ |date=2010-01-26 }}, with good pictures and information.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the importance of Ireland for Early Medieval Celtic art, the number of artefacts showing La Tène style found in Ireland is small, though they are often of very high quality.  Some aspects of Hallstatt metalwork had appeared in Ireland, such as scabbard [[chape]]s, but the La Tène style is not found in Ireland before some point between 350-150 BC, and until the latter date is mostly found in modern [[Northern Ireland]], notably in a series of engraved scabbard plates. Thereafter, despite Ireland remaining outside the Roman Empire that engulfed the Continental and British Celtic cultures, Irish art is subject to continuous influence from outside, through trade and probably periodic influxes of refugees from Britain, both before and after the Roman invasion.  It remains uncertain whether some of the most notable objects found from the period were made in Ireland or elsewhere, as far away as Germany and Egypt in specific cases.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 127-133&lt;/ref&gt;

But in Scotland and the western parts of Britain where the Romans and later the Anglo-Saxons were largely held back, versions of the La Tène style remained in use until it became an important component of the new Insular style that developed to meet the needs of newly Christianized populations.  Indeed, in northern England and Scotland most finds post-date the Roman invasion of the south.&lt;ref&gt;Garrow, 2, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lZj9AwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover google books] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231906/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lZj9AwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while there are fine Irish finds from the 1st and 2nd centuries, there is little or nothing in La Tène style from the 3rd and 4th centuries, a [[Irish Dark Age|period of instability]] in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 134&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Roman conquests, some Celtic elements remained in popular art, especially [[Ancient Roman pottery]], of which Gaul was actually the largest producer, mostly in Italian styles, but also producing work in local taste, including [[figurine]]s of deities and wares painted with animals and other subjects in highly formalized styles.  [[Roman Britain]] produced a number of items using Roman forms such as the [[fibula]] but with La Tène style ornament, whose dating can be difficult,&lt;ref&gt;Laings, 125-130&lt;/ref&gt; for example a "hinged brass collar" from around the time of the Roman conquest shows Celtic decoration in a Roman context.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/h/hinged_brass_collar.aspx Hinged brass collar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018170209/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/h/hinged_brass_collar.aspx |date=2015-10-18 }}, British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;  Britain also made more use of  [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] than most of the Empire, and on larger objects, and its development of [[champlevé]] technique was probably important to the later [[Medieval art]] of the whole of Europe, of which the energy and freedom derived from Insular decoration was an important element.  Enamel decoration on [[penannular brooch]]es, "dragonesque" brooches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/d/dragonesque_brooch.aspx|title=Dragonesque brooch |publisher=[[British Museum]]|author=|date=|website=britishmuseum.org|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hanging bowl]]s appears to demonstrate a continuity in Celtic decoration between works like the Staffordshire Moorlands Pan and the flowering of Christian Insular art from the 6th century onwards.

===Post-Roman Ireland and Britain===
Celtic art in the [[Middle Ages]] was practiced by the peoples of [[Ireland]] and parts of [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the 700-year period from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, to the establishment of [[Romanesque art]] in the 12th century.  Through the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]] the style was influential in the development of art throughout Northern Europe.

In Ireland an unbroken Celtic heritage existed from before and throughout the Roman era of Britain, which had never reached the island, though in fact Irish objects in La Tène style are very rare from the Late Roman period.  The 5th to 7th centuries were a continuation of late [[Iron Age]] La Tène art, with also many signs of the Roman and Romano-British influences that had gradually penetrated there.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 134, 172-173&lt;/ref&gt;  With the arrival of Christianity, Irish art was influenced by both Mediterranean and Germanic traditions, the latter through Irish  contacts with the [[Anglo-Saxons]], creating what is called the Insular or [[Hiberno-Saxon]] style, which had its golden age in the 8th and early 9th centuries before [[Viking]] raids severely disrupted monastic life.  Late in the period [[Scandinavia]]n influences were added through the [[Vikings]] and mixed [[Norse-Gael]] populations, then original Celtic work came to end with the [[Normans|Norman]] invasion in 1169–1170 and the subsequent introduction of the general European Romanesque style.

The [[interlace (art)|interlace]] patterns that are often regarded as typical of "Celtic art" were in fact introduced to Insular art from the Mediterranean, both directly and via the [[Animal style#Germanic animal style|animal Style II]] of Germanic [[Migration Period art]], though they were taken up with great skill and enthusiasm by Celtic artists in metalwork and [[illuminated manuscript]]s.  Equally, the forms used for the finest Insular art were all adopted from the Roman world: [[Gospel book]]s like the [[Book of Kells]] and [[Book of Lindisfarne]], chalices like the [[Ardagh Chalice]] and [[Derrynaflan Chalice]], and [[penannular brooch]]es like the [[Tara Brooch]].  These works are from the period of peak achievement of Insular art, which lasted from the 7th to the 9th centuries, before the [[Viking]] attacks sharply set back cultural life.
[[File:Ardagh chalice.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ardagh Chalice]], silver and [[millefiori]] glass. Irish. Early 8th century AD.]]

In the 7th and 9th centuries [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish Celtic missionaries]] travelled to [[Northumbria]] in Britain and brought with them the Irish tradition of [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]], which came into contact with Anglo-Saxon [[metalworking]] knowledge and [[motif (art)|motifs]]. In the [[monastery|monasteries]] of Northumbria these skills fused and were probably transmitted back to Scotland and Ireland from there, also influencing the [[Anglo-Saxon]] art of the rest of England. Some of the metalwork masterpieces created include the [[Tara Brooch]], the [[Ardagh Chalice]] and the [[Derrynaflan Chalice]]. New techniques employed were [[filigree]] and [[chip carving]], while new motifs included interlace patterns and animal ornamentation. The [[Book of Durrow]] is the earliest complete [[insular script]] illuminated [[Gospel Book]] and by about 700,  with the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], the Hiberno-Saxon style was fully developed with detailed [[carpet page]]s that seem to glow with a wide palette of colours. The art form reached its peak in the late 8th century with the [[Book of Kells]], the most elaborate Insular manuscript.  Anti-classical Insular artistic styles were carried to mission centres on the Continent and had a continuing impact on [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]], [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art]] for the rest of the [[Middle Ages]].

In the 9th and 11th century plain [[silver]] became a popular medium in Anglo-Saxon England, probably because of the increased amount in circulation due to Viking trading and raiding, and it was during this time a number of magnificent silver [[penannular brooch]]es were created in Ireland. Around the same time manuscript production began to decline, and although it has often been blamed on the Vikings, this is debatable given the decline began before the Vikings arrived. [[Sculpture]] began to flourish in the form of the "[[high cross]]", large stone crosses that held biblical scenes in carved relief. This art form reached its apex in the early 10th century and has left many fine examples such as Muiredach's Cross at [[Monasterboice]] and the [[Ahenny]] High Cross.
[[File:KellsFol032vChristEnthroned.jpg|thumb|right|[[Christ in Majesty]], [[Book of Kells]].]]

The impact of the Vikings on Irish art is not seen until the late 11th century when Irish metal work begins to imitate the [[Scandinavia]]n [[Ringerike style|Ringerike]] and [[Urnes style]]s, for example the [[Cross of Cong]] and [[Shrine of Manchan]]. These influences were found not just in the Norse centre of [[Dublin]], but throughout the countryside in stone monuments such as the Dorty Cross at [[Kilfenora]] and crosses at the [[Rock of Cashel]].

Some Insular manuscripts may have been produced in Wales, including the 8th century [[Lichfield Gospels]] and [[Hereford Gospels]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Lord, Medieval Vision: The Visual Culture of Wales. University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 2003, pg. 25; see the Wikipedia articles on the two manuscripts for further references.&lt;/ref&gt;  The late Insular [[Ricemarch Psalter]] from the 11th century was certainly written in Wales, and also shows strong Viking influence.


Art from historic [[Dumnonia]], modern Cornwall, [[Devon]], [[Somerset]] and [[Brittany]] on the [[Atlantic]] seaboard is now fairly sparsely attested and hence less well known as these areas later became incorporated into England (and France) in the medieval and Early Modern period.&lt;ref&gt;http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-769-1/dissemination/pdf/vol33/33_001_006.pdf {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151203105658/http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-769-1%2Fdissemination%2Fpdf%2Fvol33%2F33_001_006.pdf |date=2015-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However archaeological studies at sites such as [[Cadbury Castle, Somerset]],&lt;ref&gt;Alcock, L. 1995 ''Cadbury Castle: The Early Medieval Archaeology'', University of Wales; see also the [http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/scep/Bibliography.html South Cadbury Environs Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131115350/http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/scep/Bibliography.html |date=2016-01-31 }}, Oxford University&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tintagel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winchester.ac.uk/academicdepartments/archaeology/Research/Pages/TintagelRegionArchaeologicalLandscapeProject.aspx  Tintagel Region Archaeological Landscape] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124090504/http://www.winchester.ac.uk/academicdepartments/archaeology/Research/Pages/TintagelRegionArchaeologicalLandscapeProject.aspx |date=2015-11-24 }}, University of Winchester&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently at [[Ipplepen]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/archaeology/research/projects/ipplepen/context/ The Ipplepen project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223025534/https://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/archaeology/research/projects/ipplepen/context/ |date=2016-02-23 }}, University of Exeter&lt;/ref&gt; indicate a highly sophisticated largely literate society with strong influence and connections with both the [[Byzantine]] Mediterranean as well as the Atlantic Irish, and British in Wales and the '[[Hen Ogledd|Old North]]'.

===Picts (Scotland)===
From the 5th to the mid-9th centuries, the art of the [[Picts]] is primarily known through stone sculpture, and a smaller number of pieces of metalwork, often of very high quality; there are no known illuminated manuscripts.  The Picts shared modern Scotland with a zone of Irish cultural influence on the west coast, including [[Iona]], and the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria to the south.  After Christianization, Insular styles heavily influenced [[Pictish art]], with interlace prominent in both metalwork and stones.

The heavy silver [[Whitecleuch Chain]] has [[Pictish symbols]] on its terminals, and appears to be an equivalent to a torc. The symbols are also found on plaques from the [[Norrie's Law hoard]]. These are thought to be relatively early pieces.  The [[St Ninian's Isle Treasure]] of silver penannular brooches, bowls and other items comes from off the coast of [[Pictland]] and is often regarded as mostly of Pictish manufacture, representing the best survival of Late Pictish metalwork, from about 800 AD.   

[[Pictish stones]] are assigned by scholars to 3 classes.  Class I Pictish stones are unshaped standing stones incised with a series of about 35 symbols which include abstract designs (given descriptive names such as crescent and V-rod, double disc and Z-rod, 'flower' and so on by researchers); carvings of recognisable animals (bull, eagle, salmon, adder and others), as well as the [[Pictish Beast]], and objects from daily life (a comb, a mirror).  The symbols almost always occur in pairs, with in about one-third of cases the addition of the mirror, or mirror and comb, symbol, below the others.  This is often taken to symbolise a woman.  Apart from one or two outliers, these stones are found exclusively in north-east [[Scotland]] from the [[Firth of Forth]] to [[Shetland]].  Good examples include the [[Dunnichen Stone|Dunnichen]] and [[Aberlemno]] stones ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]), and the Brandsbutt and Tillytarmont stones ([[Aberdeenshire]]).
[[File:Pictish Stones in the Museum of ScotlandDSCF6250 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Pictish symbols and a rider on a [[Pictish stone]]]]

Class II stones are shaped cross-slabs carved in relief, or in a combination of incision and relief, with a prominent cross on one, or in rare cases two, faces.  The crosses are elaborately decorated with interlace, key-pattern or scrollwork, in the [[Insular art|Insular style]].  On the secondary face of the stone, Pictish symbols appear, often themselves elaborately decorated, accompanied by figures of people (notably horsemen), animals both realistic and fantastic, and other scenes.  Hunting scenes are common, Biblical motifs less so.  The symbols often appear to 'label' one of the human figures.  Scenes of battle or combat between men and fantastic beasts may be scenes from Pictish mythology.  Good examples include slabs from Dunfallandy and Meigle ([[Perthshire]]), [[Aberlemno]] ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]), [[Nigg, Highland|Nigg]], [[Shandwick]] and [[Hilton of Cadboll]] ([[Easter Ross]]).

Class III stones are in the Pictish style, but lack the characteristic symbols.  Most are cross-slabs, though there are also recumbent stones with sockets for an inserted cross or small cross-slab (e.g. at Meigle, [[Perthshire]]).  These stones may date largely to after the Scottish takeover of the Pictish kingdom in the mid 9th century.  Examples include the [[sarcophagus]] and the large collection of cross-slabs at [[St Andrews]] ([[Fife]]).

The following museums have important collections of Pictish stones: Meigle ([[Perthshire]]), [[St Vigeans]] ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]) and [[St Andrew's Cathedral, St Andrews|St Andrew's Cathedral]] ([[Fife]]) (all [[Historic Scotland]]), the [[Museum of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]] (which also exhibits almost all the major pieces of surviving Pictish metalwork), the Meffan Institute, [[Forfar]] ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]), [[Inverness Museum]], [[Groam House Museum]], [[Rosemarkie]] and Tarbat Discovery Centre, [[Portmahomack]] (both [[Easter Ross]]) and Tankerness House Museum, [[Kirkwall]], [[Orkney]].

==Celtic revival==
[[File:Boyscuchulaincover.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''The Boys' [[Cuchulain]]'', 1904, in fact closer to Viking [[Urnes style]].]]
{{main article|Celtic Revival}}
The revival of interest in Celtic visual art came sometime later than the revived interest in [[Celtic literature]].  By the 1840s reproduction Celtic brooches and other forms of metalwork were fashionable, initially in Dublin, but later in Edinburgh, London and other countries.  Interest was stimulated by the discovery in 1850 of the Tara Brooch, which was seen in London and Paris over the next decades.  The late 19th century reintroduction of monumental Celtic crosses for graves and other memorials has arguably been the most enduring aspect of the revival, one that has spread well outside areas and populations with a specific Celtic heritage. Interlace typically features on these and has also been used as a style of architectural decoration, especially in America around 1900, by architects such as [[Louis Sullivan]], and in [[stained glass]] and wall stenciling by [[Thomas A. O'Shaughnessy]], both based in [[Chicago]] with its large [[Irish-American]] population.  The "plastic style" of early Celtic art was one of the elements feeding into [[Art Nouveau]] decorative style, very consciously so in the work of designers like the [[Isle of Man|Man]]xman [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]], who did much work for [[Liberty &amp; Co.]]

The [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] in Ireland embraced the Celtic style early on, but began to back away in the 1920s. The governor of the National Gallery of Ireland, [[Thomas Bodkin]], writing in The Studio magazine in 1921, drew attention to the decline in Celtic ornament in the Sixth Exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland said, "National art all over the world has burst long ago, the  
narrow boundaries within which it is cradled, and grows more cosmopolitan in spirit with each succeeding generation." George Atkinson, writing the foreword to the catalogue of that same exhibit emphasized the society's disapproval of any undue emphasis on Celtic ornament at the expense of good design. "Special pleading on behalf of the national traditional ornament is no longer justifiable.”The style had served the nationalist cause as an emblem of a distinct Irish culture, but soon intellectual fashions abandoned Celtic art as nostalgically looking backwards.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Walker, The Modern History of Celtic Jewellery, Walker Metalsmiths, Andover, NY 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Interlace, which is still seen as a "Celtic" form of decoration—somewhat ignoring its Germanic origins and equally prominent place in Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian medieval art—has remained a motif in many forms of popular design, especially in Celtic countries, and above all Ireland, where it remains a national style signature. In recent decades it has been used worldwide in tattoos, and in various contexts and media in fantasy works with a quasi-[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] setting. ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' is an [[animation|animated]] feature film of 2009 set during the creation of the Book of Kells which makes much use of Insular design.

By the 1980s a new Celtic Revival had begun, which continues to this day. Often this late 20th-century movement is referred to as the Celtic Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Carroll, post 1170 in Discussion of Celtic Art, Yahoo Groups 2001, accessed Aug. 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s the number of new artists, craftsmen, designers and retailers specializing in Celtic jewelry and crafts was rapidly increasing. The Celtic Renaissance has been an international phenomenon, with participants no longer confined to just the Old-World Celtic countries. &lt;ref&gt;Walker, pg 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

June 9 was designated International Day of Celtic Art in 2017 by a groups of contemporary Celtic artists and enthusiasts. The day is an occasion for exhibits, promotions, workshops and demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://celticlife.com/international-celtic-art-day/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021004000/https://celticlife.com/international-celtic-art-day/ |archivedate=2017-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Note: this is a list of classes or types or terms, not specific pieces--&gt;
*[[Hanging bowl]]. According to the traditional theory, these were created by Celtic craftsmen during the time of the Anglo-Saxon conquests of England. They were based on a Roman design, usually made of copper alloy with 3 or 4 suspension loops along the top rim, from which they were designed to be hung, perhaps from roof-beams or within a tripod. Their art-historical interest mainly derives from the round decorated plaques, often with enamel, that most have along their rims.  Some of the finest examples are found in the hoard at [[Sutton Hoo]] (625) which are enamelled. The knowledge of their manufacture spread to Scotland and Ireland in the 8th century. However, although their styles continue popular Romano-British traditions, the assumption that they were made in Ireland is now questioned.
*[[Carpet page]]. An illuminated manuscript page decorated entirely in ornamentation. In Hiberno-Saxon tradition this was a standard feature of Gospel books, with one page as an introduction to each Gospel. Usually made in a geometric or interlace pattern, often framing a central cross. The earliest known example is the 7th century [[Bobbio Orosius]].
*[[High cross]]. A tall stone standing cross, usually of [[Celtic cross]] form.  Decoration is abstract often with figures in carved relief, especially [[crucifixion]]s, but in some cases complex multi-scene schemes.  Most common in Ireland, but also in Great Britain and near continental mission centres.
*[[Pictish stone]]. A cross-slab&amp;mdash;a rectangular slab of rock with a cross carved in relief on the slab face, with other pictures and shapes carved throughout. Organised into three Classes, based on the period of origin.
*[[Insular art]] or the [[Hiberno-Saxon]] style, from the 6th to 9th centuries. The fusion of pre-Christian Celtic and Anglo-Saxon metalworking styles, applied to the new form of the religious illuminated manuscript, as well as sculpture and secular and church metalwork.  Also includes influences from post-classical Europe, and later Viking decorative styles.  The peak of the style in manuscripts occurred when Irish Celtic missionaries traveled to Northumbria in the 7th and 8th centuries. Produced some of the most outstanding Celtic art of the Middle Ages in illuminated manuscripts, metalworking and sculpture.
*[[Celtic calendar]]. The oldest material Celtic calendar is the fragmented [[Gaulish]] [[Coligny calendar]] from the 1st century BC or AD.

"'''Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls'''" is the ninth episode of the [[South Park (season 2)|second season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 22nd episode of the series overall, it originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on August 19, 1998. The episode was written by series co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], along with [[Nancy M. Pimental]], and directed by Parker.&lt;ref name="The A.V. Club"&gt;Dyess-Nugent, Phil (August 19, 2012). [http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/south-park-classic-chefs-chocolate-salty-ballschic-83600 "South Park (Classic):"Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls"/"Chickenpox""]. ''[[The A.V. Club]]''. Retrieved January 2, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode, the Sundance Film Festival is moved to South Park, but it badly affects Mr. Hankey. Meanwhile, Chef tries his luck to make some money, as many visitors come to the town, by selling his new sweet treats, his chocolate salty balls.

==Plot==
[[Park City, Utah]] is in the midst of the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. Sundance's founder, [[Robert Redford]], has decided that Park City has become too [[Commercialism|commercialize]]d by the annual migration of the [[Hollywood]] [[jet set]], so he decides to move the festival to South Park, Colorado. The Sundance Festival relocates to South Park, which is immediately deluged by Hollywood tourists. In school, [[Mr. Garrison]] gives the students an assignment to see one [[independent film]] during the festival and write a report on it. [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] sets up a sales stand at the festival for his fudge cookie recipes.

At night, as [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] uses the restroom, he hears [[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]] calling to him from the toilet. Kyle persuades [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] to help him find Mr. Hankey; they enter the [[sanitary sewer|sewer system]] to look for him. They soon find Mr. Hankey, who tells Kyle that the influx of all the Hollywood tourists, with their health-food diets, has disrupted the [[ecosystem]] of the sewer, which has made him deathly ill.

Kyle and the others appear before a film's showing, and Kyle pleads with the Hollywood visitors to understand that their presence is causing the death of his friend Mr. Hankey. However, they all think Kyle is trying to pitch a script, and they offer film deals. One agent approaches Cartman to buy the rights to Kyle's story; he readily agrees. A film is produced overnight, starring [[Tom Hanks]] as Kyle and a [[monkey]] as Mr. Hankey. The South Park locals are beginning to tire of the festival, seeing that it is causing the town to become overrun with commercialism and Hollywood [[kitsch]]. However, Redford plans to sue the whole the town if they go through with ending the festival; he then reveals to his wife, Phyllis, that he will make all small towns overrun with Hollywood culture, since he cannot escape it, so he wants to inflict it on everyone else. By this time, Cartman realizes he's been cheated out by the agent and only receives three dollars from the two million dollars the Mr. Hankey movie made and Stan promptly calls Cartman a sell-out; not to be outdone, Cartman then starts selling shirts of Tom Hanks with the monkey-version of Mr. Hankey.

Kyle tries to show Mr. Hankey to the crowd, but Mr. Hankey is pale and near death. Chef feeds Mr. Hankey one of his Chocolate Salty Balls, causing him to return to life. Stan, Kyle, Chef, and Mr. Hankey approach Redford as he is on a podium to announce the return of the film festival the next year. After he ignores their pleas to relocate the festival, Mr. Hankey makes a passionate speech about film festivals - instead of catering to the glamor of Hollywood, they should focus more on giving new-coming filmmakers a chance and actually enjoy the films. Infuriated, Redford throws Mr. Hankey against a wall, killing him; Chef revitalizes Mr. Hankey once again. He then causes the sewers to erupt over South Park, causing Redford and Phyllis' car to fill with [[feces]], drowning them, and all the tourists flee the town. With the town saved (albeit covered in excrement), the boys reflect on Mr. Hankey's message and admit that while a few independent films are great, "most of them suck ass." As for Cartman, he feels that being a sell-out was positive for him because he wouldn't hang out with "poor-ass losers" like his friends and leaves with the money he earned selling shirts.

==Production==
A soundtrack album, titled ''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album]]'', was released in 1998, during the broadcast run of the second season. It comprises songs featured in and related to the series, including "[[Chocolate Salty Balls]]", performed by [[Isaac Hayes]] as Chef, from this episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Cultural references==
Cartman refers to independent films as being about "gay cowboys eating pudding". This episode aired seven years before the independent film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' was released in 2005, but one year after the publication of the [[Brokeback Mountain (short story)|short story of the same name]] by [[E. Annie Proulx|Annie Proulx]] in 1997. In an interview with the [[Associated Press]] in October 2005, series co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] responded to questions about the prophetic statement by Cartman. Parker quipped, "...if there’s pudding eating in there, we’re going to sue", and Stone claimed, "No [we're not prophets], but Cartman is. [Laughs] We went to Sundance a lot in the mid-to-late ’90s, and you could just tell it was going toward gay cowboydom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parker and Stone: ‘South Park’ prophets|url=http://www.today.com/id/9744344/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/parker-stone-south-park-prophets/#.U36i6pRdU00|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=May 22, 2014|date=October 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Christis Kirk on the Green"''' is an anonymous [[Middle Scots]] poem in 22 stanzas, now believed to have been written around the year 1500, giving a comic account of a brawl at a country fair.  It was for many years mistakenly attributed either to [[James I of Scotland]] or to [[James V of Scotland]].  It gave rise to a whole tradition of humorous poems on similar subjects by Scottish poets down the centuries, including [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] and [[Robert Burns]], and is still one of the most frequently published works in Middle Scots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=George Fenwick |date=December 1953 |title="Christis Kirk", "Peblis to the Play", and the German Peasant-Brawl |jstor=460006|journal=Publications of the Modern Language Association |volume=68 |issue=5 |page=1101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Christis Kirk on the Green" has been called one of the finest performances in 15th-century British poetry.{{sfn|Maclaine|1964|p=14}}

== Synopsis ==

The scene opens at Christ's Kirk where a dance is in full swing on the village green.  While Tom Lutar plays the music and sings, the young women flirt with their suitors.  Two of the men, Jock and Robin Ray, neither of whom has been having much luck with the girls, start to quarrel over one of them, and blows are struck.  The fight begins to spread, and threatens to become serious as bows are produced and arrows shot, but the marksmanship of all the archers is so wild that no-one is hit.  Then a general brawl develops as pitchforks, flails and laths of wood are seized, branches are torn off, and all these weapons are brought into play.  The poet turns from one character to another, and details the blows delivered and the men struck to the ground.  While the fight is still in progress the poem breaks off.

== Transmission ==

"Christis Kirk" survives in at least seven manuscripts, including the [[Bannatyne Manuscript]], the [[Maitland Manuscripts|Maitland Folio]], and one of the [[David Laing (antiquary)|Laing]] manuscripts; of these the Maitland Folio gives the best text.{{sfn|Maclaine|1996|p=155}}{{sfn|Kinghorn|1970|p=58}}  It was printed first in 1643 in a recension similar to that given by the Laing MS, and later in 1660, 1663, 1684, 1691 (by [[Edmund Gibson]]), and in 1706 (by [[James Watson (printer)|James Watson]]).{{sfn|Kinghorn|1970|p=58}}

== Date and authorship ==

The poet was certainly familiar with a tradition of Scots burlesque poems that included "Peblis to the Play" and the now-lost "Falkland on the Green", and he wrote for a sophisticated audience, or at least for one above the peasant level.{{sfn|Maclaine|1964|p=5}}{{sfn|Kinghorn|1970|p=58}}  These are almost the only reliable clues to his identity.  In 1568 [[George Bannatyne]] attributed the poem to [[James I of Scotland]], but in the next century an alternative attribution to [[James V of Scotland|James V]] was made, and in the 18th and 19th centuries a war of words between literary historians failed to decide between these two candidates.{{sfn|Maclaine|1964|pp=5–6}}  At the beginning of the 19th century James Sibbald suggested [[Robert Henryson]] as a possible author, but this idea did not find favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paterson |first1=James |author-link1=James Paterson (journalist) |year=1861 |title=James the Fifth, or The Gudeman of Ballangeich |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PzRcAAAAcAAJ&amp;q=%22Sibbald+conjectures%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Sibbald%20conjectures%22&amp;f=false |location=Edinburgh |publisher=William P.

Maclaine argued for an early 15th-century date, without committing himself to James I as author,{{sfn|Maclaine|1964|p=7}} but in 1996 he acknowledged that linguistic evidence suggested a date of around 1500.  This new date, which is now widely accepted, rules out both James I and James V, and leaves "Christis Kirk" as an anonymous poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Glen |first1=Duncan |author-link1=Duncan Glen |year=1999 |title=Scottish Literature: A New History from 1299 to 1999 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ttlZAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22written+about+1500%22 |location=Kirkcaldy |publisher=Akros |page=17 |isbn=0861421000 |access-date=6 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carruthers |first1=Gerard |year=2009 |title=Scottish Literature |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bktAAQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22latter+most+likely%22 |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=38 |isbn=9780748633081 |access-date=6 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Maclaine|1996|p=10}}

== Metre ==

The stanzas are each of ten lines rhyming ABABABABCD.{{sfn|Kinghorn|1970|p=58}}  The first eight lines alternate [[iambic tetrameter]] with [[trimeter]], the ninth is a two-syllable "[[Bob and wheel|bob]]", and the final line forms the refrain "At Christis Kirk on the green".  Much alliteration is used, which, together with the recurring rhymes, gives the verse a headlong pace, while the bob line is useful in accentuating the humour.  The combined effect is to make the poem well-suited to recitation or singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=Roderick |author-link1=Roderick Watson |year=2007 |title=The Literature of Scotland: The Middle Ages to the Nineteenth Century |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lFzcCwAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22to+be+clinched%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22to%20be%20clinched%22&amp;f=false |edition=2nd |location=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=53 |isbn=033366664X |access-date=6 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Setting ==

Most modern commentators accept the tradition, first reported in print by [[William Tytler]] in 1783, that the Christ's Kirk of the poem is a ruined church in the parish of Leslie, near the village of [[Insch]] in [[Aberdeenshire]].  According to Tytler a fair was held by this church every May Day until the end of the 17th century.  In 1715 [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] proposed a different [[Leslie, Fife|Leslie]] in [[Fife]] as the site of the poem, and was seconded by [[John Callander]] in his 1782 edition of the poem.  However this identification is probably based simply on a confusion of place-names, and it is no longer believed to have any good evidence in its favour.{{sfn|Maclaine|1996|pp=156–157}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1782 |editor1-last=Callander |editor1-first=John |title=Two Ancient Scottish Poems: The Gaberlunzie-Man and Christ's Kirk on the Green |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sNxfAAAAcAAJ&amp;q=%22near+Falkland%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22near%20Falkland%22&amp;f=false |location=Edinburgh |publisher=J. Balfour ''et al.'' |page=99 |access-date=7 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  James Sibbald identified Christ's Kirk with the church of [[St Salvator's College, St Andrews|St. Salvator's College, St. Andrews]], but, as with his authorship theory, this idea has found no supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1824 |editor1-last=Chalmers |editor1-first=George |editor1-link=George Chalmers (antiquarian) |title=The Poetic Remains of Some of the Scotish Kings |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KNxLAAAAcAAJ&amp;q=%22suit+his+own+system%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22suit%20his%20own%20system%22&amp;f=false |location=London |publisher=John Murray |page=135 |access-date=7 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Critics agree that the main virtues of the poem do not lie in subtlety of descriptive detail, nor in coherence of structure, but in a fast-paced excitement and wild comic verve that suggest comparison with [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch peasant paintings]].  Vividly described scenes of grotesque and earthy incident (possibly too earthy for some modern tastes) follow one after the other in rapid succession.{{sfn|Smith|1908}}{{sfn|Maclaine|1964|pp=12, 14}}  As the literary historian [[George Gregory Smith]] wrote, "Everybody is at fever-heat: the louder the women's voices and the harder the blows, the better the fun."  This forms a striking contrast with the [[Aureation|aureate]] manner of the poet's contemporaries, the [[Scottish Chaucerians]].{{sfn|Smith|1908}}  The exigencies of rhyme-scheme and alliteration that the poet faces are very rigorous, but he meets them with such inventiveness and apparent ease that it has been called a ''tour de force'' of mastery of technique.{{sfn|Maclaine|1964|pp=12–13}}

== Legacy ==

"Christis Kirk" and a similar earlier poem, "Peblis at the Play", exercised a noticeable influence on the [[makar]] [[William Dunbar]], some of whose poems use similar metrical and stylistic techniques to achieve a fast-moving effect.  Similar traces of the two older poems can be seen in the anonymous 16th-century "[[The Tale of Ralph the Collier|Rauf Coilyear]]", "The Cursing of Sir John Rowell" and "Symmie and his Bruder".{{sfn|Kinghorn|1970|p=14}}{{sfn|Maclain|1964|pp=15–17}}  In 1718 the poet Allan Ramsay published "Christis Kirk" together with two additional [[canto]]s of his own composition.  This work reached a 5th edition in only five years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=23072|title=Ramsay Allan (1684–1758}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so popularized the poem that few others were reprinted so many times in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fox |first1=Adam |year=2013 |chapter=Approaches to Ephemera: Scottish Broadsides, 1679–1746 |editor1-last=Murphy |editor1-first=Kevin D. |editor2-last=O'Driscoll |editor2-first=Sally |title=Studies in Ephemera: Text and Image in Eighteenth-Century Print |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eIi_Olu7nfwC&amp;q=%22commonly+reprinted%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22commonly%20reprinted%22&amp;f=false |location=Lewisburg |publisher=Bucknell University Press |page=127 |isbn=9781611484953 |access-date=8 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A fourth canto followed in 1766, published in Alexander Nicol's ''Poems on Several Subjects''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pittock |first1=Murray |author-link1=Murray Pittock |year=2008 |title=Scottish and Irish Romanticism |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=elHtMC8Od6cC&amp;q=%22canto+as+well+as%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22canto%20as%20well%20as%22&amp;f=false |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=46–47 |isbn=9780199232796 |access-date=8 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One result of the poem's success was the emergence of a whole subgenre of comic poems set at fairs, country dances and similar merrymakings, and narrated by detached and amused observers, in which horseplay, practical jokes and drunkenness play a prominent part, and colourful scene-painting makes 
up for thin story-lines.{{sfn|Maclaine|1964|p=4}}{{sfn|Baraniuk|2008|p=125}}  Examples include [[Robert Fergusson]]'s "Leith Races", [[James Orr (poet)|James Orr]]'s "Donegore Hill" and "The Passengers", Samuel Thomson's "The Simmer Fair" and "The Hawk and the Weasel" and [[Robert Burns]]'s "The Jolly Beggars", "The Ordination" and "The Holy Fair".

The '''Cider Mill Playhouse''' in [[Endicott, New York]], was a professional theater producing comedies, dramas and musicals.  It was a member of the [[Theatre Communications Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcg.org/about/membership/member_list.cfm|title=TCG Member Theatres|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Theatre Communications Group]]|accessdate=2010-02-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813033643/http://www.tcg.org/about/membership/member_list.cfm|archivedate=2012-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operated as a Small Professional Theatre, Level 5, by annual contract with Actors' Equity Association.

== History ==
In the early 1970s, [[Binghamton University]] (then known as "SUNY B") professor and soon to be theater department chairman, Dr. John Bielenberg sought to expand the theater department venue to an off-campus site, first, to enhance "town-gown" presence, and second, and most important, to give the department's students more opportunities to practice and hone their craft.

In 1991, after funding from the university was withdrawn, Cider Mill Playhouse incorporates as a 501c3 charitable organization which it remains today. 

After operating as a semi-professional theater for many years, Cider Mill Playhouse became an "Equity house" professional theater as of December 21, 2015 under the artistic leadership of Gail King Belokur.

== Facility ==
Dr. Bielenberg and his colleagues found The Cider Mill, an apple warehouse on South Nanticoke in the Village of Endicott. After some discussions, Mill owner Orlando Ciotoli agreed and, on a handshake, the Playhouse was launched.

== Productions ==

===Early Productions===
Early productions included  ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'', ''[[Sleuth (play)|Sleuth]]'', ''Night Must Fall'', ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'', ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', ''[[Whose Life Is It Anyway? (play)|Whose Life Is It Anyway]]'', ''[[Da (play)|Da]]'', ''[[Agnes of God]]'', ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'', ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]'', ''The Last meeting of the Knights of the White Magnolia'', and others.
"The professional nature of the theater was all important to us," recalled Dr. John Bielenberg, now-retired BU Theater Department Chairman. "The students were able to work with the professionals, whom we hired as actors and directors, in an atmosphere that they would find in their theater careers." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= |title=Cider Mill Re-Opens |author=Grey, Gene |date=October 1, 1992 |work= |publisher=Press and Sun Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A Christmas Carol ===
Cider Mill mounts an annual production of Charles Dickens' [[A Christmas Carol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcg.org/about/membership/member_list.cfm|title=Cider Mill Playhouse presents 'A Christmas Carol'|last=Post|first=Wendy|date=2009-12-13|publisher=[[Owego (town), New York|Owego]] Penny Saver|accessdate=2010-02-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813033643/http://www.tcg.org/about/membership/member_list.cfm|archivedate=2012-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in 1982, Cider Mill Playhouse produced its own musical version of the story which was copyrighted by founder John Bielenberg. After many years and revisions, the final version of this production was produced in 2015. Beginning in 2016, a new adaptation was produced to address copyright issues that had developed. This version expanded the cast to include a combination of paid professionals and a volunteer community ensemble, which embodies the commitment Cider Mill Playhouse to continue work by professionals while providing opportunities for community theatre involvement.

'''Dissernet''' ({{lang-ru|Диссернет}}) is a volunteer community network working to clean Russian science of [[plagiarism]]. The core activity of the community is conducting examinations of [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral]] and [[habilitation]] (higher doctorate) theses defended in Russian scientific and educational institutions since the end of the 1990s, and making the results of such examinations known to as many people as possible. The community is composed of professional scientists working in various fields of science both in Russia and abroad, and also journalists, civil activists and volunteers.

Launched in early 2013, the project had by 2016 identified around 5,600 suspected plagiarists — focusing on officials in government and academia, and other member the country's elite — and released reports on around 1,300 of them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/05/the_thriving_russian_black_market_in_dissertations_and_the_crusaders_fighting.html|title=The Craziest Black Market in Russia|last=Neyfakh|first=Leon|date=2016-05-22|newspaper=Slate|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=2016-05-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230022705/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/05/the_thriving_russian_black_market_in_dissertations_and_the_crusaders_fighting.html|archivedate=2016-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian media regularly report on Dissernet's findings, and the site has been credited with raising attention for the issue of [[academic fraud]] in the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In a 2016 exposé, Dissernet showed that 1 in 9 members of the [[State Duma]] had obtained academic degrees with theses that were substantially plagiarized and likely ghostwritten.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Activities ==
The objective of Dissernet’s examinations is to detect gross and deliberate violations of the legally established rules for certification of scientific workers’, as well as violations of the regulations for awarding  [[academic degree]]s. Dissernet  deems theses containing such violations to be fraudulent, and diplomas certifying the doctoral and higher doctoral degrees conferred after defending such theses to be illegal and subject to cancellation.

The key elements of the dissertation fraud detected in the course of Dissernet’s analyses are as follows:

* Large-scale, bad faith and non-attributed  plagiarism   of other people's scientific works and other texts used by the authors of examined works in breach of the proper citation rules fixed in regulations of the  [[Higher Attestation Commission]] (VAK) of the [[Ministry of Education and Science (Russia)|Ministry of Education and Science of Russia]];
* Falsification of scientific research articles which, according to VAK regulations, are a mandatory prerequisite for awarding the respective academic degree to the applicant;
* Gross violations of the rules for thesis preparation (documenting performed research, interaction with the scientific research supervisor, advisor, opponents, co-authors, getting formal responses, etc.) as well as the procedure for defense of the thesis prescribed by VAK regulations.

Within the active phase of Dissernet’s activity, which started in January 2013, its members have published results of examinations of thesis defended by scores of well-known and powerful Russian politicians and public figures. As of the{{Clarify|date=August 2015}} middle of the year 2014, more than 2000 completed expertises of Doctoral and higher doctoral theses in various directions and branches of science were contained in Dissernet database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dissernet.org/expertise The latest expertises] on the Dissernet site&lt;/ref&gt; Among the people attracting Dissernet’s attention were deputies of the [[State Duma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexandrova|first=Lyudmila|url=http://en.itar-tass.com/opinions/1451|title= Russia’s bloggers help authorities expose forged dissertations|publisher=[[Russian News Agency TASS]]|date=March 20, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of the [[Federation Council (Russia)|Federation Council]], [[governor (Russia)|governors]] of constituent entities of the Russian Federation, high-ranking officials of executive authorities,&lt;ref name="investigators"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/crime/20131125/184982011/Russias-Top-Investigator-Accused-of-Plagiarism.html|title=Russia’s Top Investigator Accused of Plagiarism|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=November 25, 2013|accessdate= February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; heads of security and military services, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rupaper.com/post/12076|title=The Moscow minister will ask to cancel his thesis|publisher=Rupaper.com |date= December 2, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mass media coverage ==
The work of the Dissernet community has gained much publicity and has been broadly covered in Russian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Girin|first=Nikita|url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/politics/60155.html|title=Это не про науку. Это про репутацию и враньё|work=[[Novaya Gazeta]]|issue=107|date=September 25, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; and foreign mass media.&lt;ref name="muckrakers"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lipman|first=Masha|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/03/russias-dissertation-fraud-muckrakers.html|title=Russia’s dissertation-fraud muckrakers|author=|date=March 9, 2013|work=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The result of the research performed by the Monitoring Center Public.Ru (more than 7500 federal and regional social and political and business [[printed matter]]s, Internet [[mass media]], news feeds of [[News agency|Press agencies]], programs of central TV- and radio-channels have been analysed) showed that at 2013 year-end the word "Dissernet" was accepted as third by popularity [[neologism]] of the year, after the words "[[Euromaidan]]" and "[[titushky]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.ru/press_slovo_2013/|title=Пресс-слово 2013|publisher=Public.Ru|accessdate=February 13, 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the magazine ''Russian Reporter'' mentioned Dissernet’s work among the most notable milestones of the year 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://expert.ru/russian_reporter/2013/50/vehi-goda/|title=Вехи года|work=Russian Reporter|number=50|date=December 19, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Internet edition ''The Village'' published an article about Dissernet in the dictionary "Summaries of 2013: main words and phrases of the outgoing year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krasilnikova|first=Nastya|url= http://www.the-village.ru/village/city/city/136119-slovar-2|title=Итоги 2013: главные слова и фразы уходящего года|work=The Village|date= December 23, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine ''[[Kommersant]]'', while listing in its concluding issue the major cultural and social events of the 2013, devoted a separate article to Dissernet’s struggle with falsifications and plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2369341|title="Диссернет" начал борьбу с фальсификациями и плагиатом|work=[[Kommersant|Kommersant Weekend]]|issue=47|date=December 20, 2013|page=69|accessdate=February 13, 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community manifest ==
The "Dissernet Manifest", which was developed and agreed upon in June–July 2013, contains the declaration of the organizers and members about the basic objectives, tasks and principles of joint activity of the community members:

“Dissernet”  is a networking community of experts, researchers and reporters seeking to unmask swindlers, forgers and liars. With their joint efforts based on the use of modern computer technologies and principles of networking division of labor, the community members oppose abusive practices, machinations and falsifications in the fields of scientific research and education, in particular in the process of defending theses and awarding academic degrees in Russia. The analytical work and disclosures of Dissernet equally cover various categories of Russian citizens:

* professional scientists or persons claiming to be such scientists without any valid basis.
* politicians and public figures seeking to improve their reputation and gain additional support and respect of their countrymen through defending theses and obtaining official diplomas conferring the doctoral and higher doctoral degree.

The Dissernet members act on a voluntary basis, on their own initiative and without any outside pressure. The examinations, studies and publications of Dissernet are in strict compliance with the laws of the Russian Federation and do not violate any [[copyright]] or other rights. Dissernet is under no obligations to any state authorities, governmental
or administrative institutions, political associations or movements, commercial corporations or entities. Its members work in the community irrespective of their political, corporate or any other views, they do not pursue any commercial purposes, their efforts are not aimed at advertising or promotion of any product or trademark, and they do not set any other goals except the above-mentioned ones. Dissernet’s expenses in connection with the fulfillment of its tasks are covered by means of voluntary donations by people sympathizing with its mission and sharing its views.

== History ==

A '''document''' is a written, drawn, presented, or memorialized representation of [[thought]]. The word originates from the Latin ''documentum'', which denotes a "teaching" or "lesson": the verb ''doceō'' denotes "to teach". In the past, the word was usually used to denote a written proof useful as evidence of a truth or fact. In the [[computer age]], "document" usually denotes a primarily textual [[computer file]], including its structure and format, e.g. fonts, colors, and [[Computer-generated imagery|images]]. Contemporarily, "document" is not defined by its [[transmission medium]], e.g., paper, given the existence of [[electronic document]]s. "Documentation" is distinct because it has more denotations than "document". Documents are also distinguished from "[[Realia (library science)|realia]]", which are three-dimensional objects that would otherwise satisfy the definition of "document" because they memorialize or represent thought; documents are considered more as 2 dimensional representations. While documents are able to have large varieties of customization, all documents are able to be shared freely, and have the right to do so, creativity can be represented by documents, also. History, events, examples, opinion, etc. all can be expressed in documents. 

==Abstract definitions==
The concept of "document" has been defined by [[Suzanne Briet]] as "any concrete or symbolic indication, preserved or recorded, for reconstructing or for proving a phenomenon, whether physical or mental."&lt;ref&gt;Briet. 1951. 7. Quoted in Buckland, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

An often cited article concludes that "the evolving notion of ''document''" among Jonathan Priest, [[Paul Otlet|Otlet]], Briet, [[Walter Schürmeyer|Schürmeyer]], and the other [[documentalist]]s increasingly emphasized whatever functioned as a document rather than traditional physical forms of documents. The shift to digital technology would seem to make this distinction even more important. [[David M. Levy|Levy's]] thoughtful analyses have shown that an emphasis on the technology of digital documents has impeded our understanding of digital documents as documents (e.g., Levy, 1994&lt;ref&gt;Levy, D. M. "Fixed or Fluid? Document Stability and New Media." 1994. In ''European Conference on Hypertext Technology 1994 Proceedings'', pp. 24–31. New York: Association for Computing Machinery. Retrieved 18 October 2011 from 
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.119.8813&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;). A conventional document, such as a mail message or a technical report, exists physically in digital technology as a string of bits, as does everything else in a digital environment. As an object of study, it has been made into a document. It has become physical evidence by those who study it.

"Document" is defined in [[library and information science]] and [[documentation science]] as a fundamental, abstract idea: the word denotes everything that may be represented or memorialized in order to serve as evidence. The classic example provided by [[Suzanne Briet]] is an [[antelope]]: "An antelope running wild on the plains of Africa should not be considered a document[;] she rules. But if it were to be captured, taken to a zoo and made an object of study, it has been made into a document. It has become physical evidence being used by those who study it. Indeed, scholarly articles written about the antelope are secondary documents, since the antelope itself is the primary document."&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, M. "What Is a Digital Document?" 1998. In ''Document Numérique'' Paris. 2(2). [http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/digdoc.html].&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion has been interpreted as an early expression of [[actor–network theory]].

==Kinds==
Documents are sometimes classified as [[Classified information|secret]], [[Privacy|private]], or public. They may also be described as [[Draft document|drafts]] or [[Proofreading|proofs]]. When a document is [[Copying|copied]], the source is denominated the "[[Originality|original]]".

Standards are accepted for specific applications in various fields, e.g.:
* Academia: [[manuscript]], [[thesis]], [[Academic publishing|paper]], and [[Academic journal|journal]]
* Business: [[invoice]], [[Financial quote|quote]], [[RFP]], [[Proposal (business)|proposal]], [[contract]], [[packing slip]], [[Ship's manifest|manifest]], [[report]] (detailed and summary), [[spread sheet]], [[MSDS]], [[waybill]], [[bill of lading]] (BOL), [[financial statement]], [[nondisclosure agreement]] (NDA), mutual nondisclosure agreement (MNDA), and user guide
* [[Government]], [[law]], and [[politics]]: [[Patent application|application]], [[brief (law)|brief]], [[certificate (disambiguation)#Official document|certificate]], [[Commission (document)|commission]], [[Constitutional documents|constitutional document]], [[Form (document)|form]], [[gazette]], [[identity document]], [[license]], [[summons]], and [[white paper]]
* Media: [[mock-up]] and [[screenplay|script]]

Such standard documents can be drafted based on a [[Template (word processing)|template]].

==Drafting==
The [[page layout]] of a document is the manner in which information is graphically arranged in the space of the document, e.g., on a page. If the appearance of the document is of concern, page layout is generally the responsibility of a [[graphic design]]er. [[Typography]] concerns the design of letter and symbol forms and their physical arrangement in the document (see [[typesetting]]). [[Information design]] concerns the effective communication of [[information]], especially in industrial documents and public [[sign]]s. Simple textual documents may not require visual design and may be drafted only by an [[author]], [[Data entry clerk|clerk]], or [[transcriber]]. [[Form (document)|Forms]] may require a visual design for their initial fields, but not to complete the forms.

==History==
[[File:LL Zamenhof birth certificate.jpg|thumb|A birth certificate from 1859]]
Traditionally, the medium of a document was [[paper]] and the information was applied to it in [[ink]], either by hand writing (to make a [[manuscript]]) or by mechanical process (e.g., a [[printing press]] or [[laser printer]]). Today, some short documents also may consist of sheets of paper [[Staple (fastener)|stapled]] together.

Historically, documents were inscribed with [[ink]] on [[papyrus]] (starting in ancient [[Egypt]]) or [[parchment]]; scratched as [[runes]] or carved on stone using a sharp tool, e.g., the [[Tablets of Stone]] described in the [[Bible]]; stamped or incised in [[clay]] and then baked to make [[clay tablet]]s, e.g., in the [[Sumer]]ian and other [[Mesopotamia]]n civilizations. The [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]] was often rolled into a [[scroll (parchment)|scroll]] or cut into sheets and [[Bookbinding|bound]] into a [[codex]] (book).

Contemporary electronic means of memorializing and displaying documents include:
* [[Computer display|Monitor]] of a [[desktop computer]], [[laptop]], [[tablet computer|tablet PC]], et cetera; optionally with a [[computer printer|printer]] to produce a [[hard copy]];
* [[Personal digital assistant]] (PDA);
* Dedicated [[e-book device]];
* [[Electronic paper]], typically, using the [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF);
* [[Information appliance]];
* [[Digital audio player]]; and
* [[Radio]] and [[television]] [[Telecommunications Service Provider|service provider]].

Digital documents usually require a specific [[file format]] in order to be presentable in a specific medium.

== In law ==
Documents in all forms frequently serve as material [[evidence]] in criminal and civil proceedings. The [[forensic]] analysis of such a document is within the scope of [[questioned document examination]]. For the purpose of cataloging and managing the large number of documents that may be produced during [[litigation]], [[Bates numbering]] is often applied to all documents in the lawsuit so that each document has a unique, arbitrary, identification number.

'''Fantasy Unlimited''' was a [[multimedia]] artists [[collective]] in New York.

==History==
The collective was founded by Peter Nevard in 1967. One of the co-founders was [[David Edward Byrd]], whom Peter knew from art school.
The collective lived and worked on a {{convert|110|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm on the bank of the [[Neversink River]] in [[Port Jervis, New York|Port Jervis, NY]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.david-edward-byrd.com/biocontact-1.html Fantasy Unlimited Bio]&lt;/ref&gt;
Peter Nevard was the leader and had most of the equipment and financial know-how.

The collective consisted of seven artists and did about one major commercial light show a month. These were, at that time, called Press Shows - a new product was presented with strobe lights, liquid projections, slide projections, film, smoke, bubbles, and modern dancers in flesh body suits. David Edward Byrd created projections, art slides, and glass paintings and ran special effects during the various shows.

Notable work:
*[[Clairol]], "The Innocence of Blonde" with [[Cheryl Tiegs]] (for Clairol's Innocent Blond range of products)
*[[Yardley of London|Yardley]] cosmetics, "The Yardley London Look" with [[Jean Shrimpton]]
*[[Bill Blass Limited|Bill Blass]], "The Bill Blass Collection" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billblass.com/ The Bill Blass Collection on the official website]&lt;/ref&gt;
but also work for:
*[[Bloomingdale's]]
*Boussac of France (fabrics, now part of Pierre Frey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pierrefrey.com/ The Pierre Frey website]&lt;/ref&gt;)
*[[Dayton's|Dayton’s of Minneapolis]]
*[[Polo Ralph Lauren|Ralph Lauren]]
*[[Oscar de la Renta]]
*[[Tenneco]] Chemicals
among others. 

In early 1968, work was started for [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] for venues of major stars in the new [[Fillmore East]] Ballroom in [[East Village, Manhattan|Manhattan’s East Village]].  

Fantasy Unlimited created posters and other art work for, among others, [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]].

Although the collective only existed for a few years, and may not have been a force culturally, it made some notable contributions (especially the work of David Edward Byrd).

==Trivia==
Clairol's catchphrase: "Does She... Or Doesn't She?" was coined by [[Shirley Polykoff]]

==Gallery==
Posters created by Fantasy Unlimited (by [[David Edward Byrd|Byrd]]) for Bill Graham. The poster for the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]] was voted #8 in the Top 25 Rock Posters by [[Billboard Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboardlists.50webs.com/billboard-25-best-rock-posters-of-all-time.html The list of Top 25 Rock Posters by Billboard Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A '''feminist blog''' presents the issues of [[feminism]] through a [[blog]]. Feminist blogs serve the purpose of spreading ideas, sparking debates, raising awareness, discussing opinions, sharing stories, and virtually spreading the notion of feminism throughout the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Gunnarrsun Payne, “Feminist Media As Alternative Media? A Literature Review” Interface: A Journal For And About Social Movements, no. 1 (2009): 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feministing]] consciously includes differing types of blogs, news sources, and organizations providing the site’s commitment to diversity in all aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica M. Mowles, "Framing Issues, Fomenting Change, 'Feministing': A Contemporary Feminist Blog in the Landscape of Online Political Activism, International Reports on Socio-Informatics, vol. 5, issue 1 (2008): 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on feminism==
These blogs have also empowered women in the media field, which still remains largely male dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Carrie Hamilton, "Feminist testimony in the internet age: sex work, blogging and the politics of witnessing" Journal of Romance Studies, no. 9 (2009) 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global impact==

With feminist blogging, women can have a voice to speak up about their opinions and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Z|title=Julie|url=http://thefbomb.org/2013/03/technology-and-the-future-of-feminism/|work=Technology and the Future of Feminism|publisher=fbomb|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also allows them to openly discuss about their situation with confidence and can help avoid being seen as silent or submissive. By blogging, it is seen as an effective method in getting the involvement of others or getting the attention of politically active people. With women discussing about events confidently, it allows a community of like minded individuals to understand what is occurring around the world and how they can get involved with different issues. With blogging, there is empowerment to make a difference within governments and international communities by getting involved through blogging. Feminist blogging is seen as a public activity that allows anyone to see a situation from a different viewpoint. Unlike traditional forms of media that discusses situations through a specific view that may appear to be male influence or avoids discussing about it, the information through feminist blogs is seen as transparent rather than edited for appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Z|title=Julie|url=http://thefbomb.org/2013/03/technology-and-the-future-of-feminism/|work=Technology and the Future of Feminism|publisher=fbomb|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With feminist blogging, there is an increase in activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Z|title=Julie|url=http://thefbomb.org/2013/03/technology-and-the-future-of-feminism/|work=Technology and the Future of Feminism|publisher=fbomb|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many critics{{who|date=October 2015}} argue that nothing gets accomplished, feminist blogging encourages activism. Women use blogging as a method to get information and understanding of concepts or issues. Feminist blogging allows an individual who is in a community that does not understand or have much knowledge of the issues that many women go through. So, it allows individuals to get the information that many news resources may not cover and allows individuals to see through a difference perspective gaze. The gaze is not through a Western perspective, but rather a perspective of women living in that country with different cultural beliefs than Western societies. With women blogging about their opinions and hardships they endure, their personal problems become political and international as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shepherd |first1=Laura|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-45388-2|pages=326-346|author2=M. Franklin|authorlink=Sex, Gender and Cyberspace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXCNAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=978-0-415-45388-2&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |deadurl=no |accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist blogging can be seen as an essential method in the democratization of women through online activism. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Z|title=Julie|url=http://thefbomb.org/2013/03/technology-and-the-future-of-feminism/|work=Technology and the Future of Feminism|publisher=fbomb|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist blogging allows individuals to understand that activism in the modern era has changed. It allows individuals to incorporate social issues, such as feminism, into political activism and, allows for people to discover different forms of feminist theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Z|title=Julie|url=http://thefbomb.org/2013/03/technology-and-the-future-of-feminism/|work=Technology and the Future of Feminism|publisher=fbomb|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of feminist blogs==
There are many different types of feminist blogs on the Internet. Some of the most common types of feminist blogs include: Personal, Topical, Collaborative, Political, Corporate, and Advice.&lt;ref&gt;Vicki Tobias, “Blog This! An Introduction to Blogs, Blogging, and the Feminist Blogosphere” Feminist Collections, no. 26 (2005): 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through [[Feministing]], feminism ideologies of the third-wave era conjoins with political activism to substantially reshape the way in which we look at political discourse. conventional political discourse. Feministing aims at creating awareness and serving as a platform open for blogger commentary on an array of political issues.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica M. Mowles, "Framing Issues, Fomenting Change, 'Feministing': A Contemporary Feminist Blog in the Landscape of Online Political Activism, International Reports on Socio-Informatics, vol. 5, issue 1 (2008): 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Different feminist blogs have different rules for participating in the discussion boards and comment boxes. Feminist blogs aim to keep a neutral yet expressive atmosphere in the blog realm since many discussed issues can be very controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth K. Keenan, “Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture”, no. 14 (2010): 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Since blogging is part of the World Wide Web, the atmosphere is not always positive. People of any standpoint can express their opinions and voice their thoughts on specific topics. Blogging can be dangerous in terms of discussing some controversial feminist issues such as abortion etc. because the environment is open to anyone, it can become very opinionated and discriminatory.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa C. Gregg, “Feeling Ordinary: Blogging As Controversial Scholarship” Last modified November 6, 2006, http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:7740/FeelingOrdinary.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[fountain]] in the [[Piazza Colonna]]''' is a fountain in  [[Rome]], [[Italy]],  designed by the architect [[Giacomo Della Porta]] and constructed by the [[Fiesole]] sculptor Rocco Rossi between 1575 and 1577.&lt;ref&gt;Tazartes, Fontaines de Rome, pg. 17 and 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The fountain was one of a group of sixteen fountains built by Della Porta following the reconstruction of the [[Acqua Vergine]] aqueduct, a project begun by [[Pope Pius IV]] in 1561 and finished by [[Pope Pius V]] in 1570.   The fountain itself was built under [[Pope Gregory XIII]], best known for creating the [[Gregorian calendar]].  Like the other Roman fountains of its time, it was built to provide clean drinking water to the Roman residents, who before then had to drink the polluted water of the [[Tiber River]].   Also like the other fountains of its time, it operated purely by gravity;  the source of the water was higher the fountain itself, causing the water to spout into the air.   

The water for the fountain first arrived at the old Trevi Fountain, then went two reservoirs at the foot of the butte of San Sebastiancello, then through a series of the channels to the corner of via Condotti and the via del Corso,  to [[Piazza Venezia]], to the foot of the column of [[Marcus Aurelius]].  The source of the water for the fountain of Piazza Colonna was only 67 feet above sea level;  like the [[Trevi Fountain]], the [[Fontana della Barcaccia]], and the fountains of [[Piazza Navona]], all connected to the Acqua Vergine, the fountain of Piazza Colonna was unable to jet water high into the air.&lt;ref&gt;See Katherine Wentworth Rinne,  ''The Fall and Rise of the Waters of Rome'', in Marilyn Symmes,  ''Fountains - Splash and Spectacle''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original project of Della Porta was to place an antique Roman statue of a sea god, called Marforio, in  the fountain, against a background of a rocky grotto, behind which the column of Marcus Aurelius would be seen.&lt;ref&gt;See Tazartes, pg. 58. The original design by Della Porta, dated 1574, was found in the papers of Pole Alexander VII.  See D'Onofrio, pg. 114, figure 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  The final fountain was simpler:  the octagonal basin of the fountain was made of pink marble from the island of [[Chios]] in [[Greece]], the same marble that Della Porta used for frame of the doorway of [[St. Peter's Basilica]].  Della Porta also designed the sixteen carved lion heads around the basin.   A circular stone vasque was placed on a pedestal in the center, and water poured from this vasque into the basin.&lt;ref&gt;Tazartes, pg. 58&lt;/ref&gt;     

The fountain was slightly restored by [[Bernini]] during the pontificate of [[Pope Alexander VII]].   In 1702 Pope Clement XI placed his own coat of arms, a star with eight points, on top of the original vasque in the center, but this was removed after his death.  

In 1830 the architect Alessandro Stocchi removed the original central vasque and replaced it with the current vasque, made of white marble.  He also added two groups of sculptures of dolphins, their tails wrapped around seashells, spouting water from their mouths, at either end of the basin.

'''HOK''', formerly '''Hellmuth, Obata + Kassabaum''', is an American worldwide design, [[architecture]], [[engineering]] and [[urban planning]] firm. 

As of 2018, HOK is the largest U.S.-based architecture-engineering firm&lt;ref&gt;Staff (April 2018) [https://www.enr.com/toplists/2018-Top-500-Design-Firms1 "Top 500 Design Firms"], ''[[Engineering News-Record]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and the fourth-largest interior design firm.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (January 2018) [https://www.interiordesign.net/giants/2018/ "2018 Top 100 Giants Research Ranking"], ''[[Interior Design Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The firm maintains more than 1,700 professional staff across a global network of 24 offices and is active in all major architectural specialties. Its senior leaders are located in several different locations across the world.

== History ==
HOK was established in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in 1955. The firm's name is derived from the surnames of its three founding partners: George Hellmuth, [[Gyo Obata]] and George Kassabaum, all graduates of the School of Architecture at [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. The design firm started with 26 employees and its three founders.

The practice's first building designs were schools in St. Louis suburbs, and St. Thomas Aquinas High School in [[Florissant, MO|Florissant]] was the first private/parochial school designed by the firm. Another prominent school they designed was the [[Saint Louis Priory School]]. By the mid-1960s, the firm was winning commissions across the [[United States]] and began to open additional offices, starting with [[San Francisco]] in 1966 for the design of a library at Stanford University and Dallas in 1968 for the master planning and design of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Also in 1968, HOK launched its interior design practice. HOK also expanded into Washington, DC, after winning the commission to design the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. In 1973, HOK established a presence in New York by acquiring Kahn &amp; Jacobs, designers of many New York City skyscrapers. By the 1970s, the firm was operating internationally and in 1975 the firm was named as architect of the $3.5 billion [[King Saud University]] in [[Riyadh]], at the time the single largest building project in the world. In 1979, George Kassabaum was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Associate Academician.

In 1983, HOK formed HOK Sport Venue Event, which became a leader in designing sport stadiums, arenas and convention centers. In January 2009, the Board of HOK Group, Inc. and managers of HOK Sports Facilities, LLC transferred ownership of HOK Sport to leaders of that practice. The company became an independent firm, and rebranded itself as [[Populous (company)|Populous]].

HOK's first office outside the United States opened in [[Hong Kong]] in 1984. In 1987, the firm opened a London office and then, in 1995, expanded this London practice by merging with renowned UK architectural practice Cecil Denny Highton. In November 1994, HOK acquired [[CRSS Architects, Inc.]] based in [[Houston, Texas]], adding offices in Houston and Atlanta. HOK established its first offices in Canada (Toronto and Ottawa) in 1997 with the acquisition of Urbana Architects.

In 2004, George Hellmuth's nephew, [[William Hellmuth]], was named president of the firm.&lt;ref name="bizprofile"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://washington.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2008/11/17/tidbits10.html?b=1226898000^1734031&amp;page=1 | first=Deborah K. | last=Dietsch | title=HOK's Bill Hellmuth: On top of the world | date=November 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, international work represented more than 40% of HOK's annual revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (June 23, 2008) "Uncertain Economy Pushes Design Firms To Diversify Their Portfolios" ''[[Engineering News-Record]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, HOK opened an office in [[Mumbai]], [[India]]. In 2010, it established an office in [[Seattle, Washington]].

In 2012, HOK Chairman [[Bill Valentine (architect)|Bill Valentine]] retired after 50 years with the firm. HOK Chief Executive Officer [[Patrick MacLeamy]], FAIA, assumed the role of chairman.

'''''He's Just Not That Into You''''' is a [[self-improvement]] book written by [[Greg Behrendt]] and [[Liz Tuccillo]] that was published in 2004 and later adapted into a film by the [[He's Just Not That Into You (film)|same name]] in 2009. It was a [[New York Times bestseller]] and was featured on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.

== Background ==
The book was inspired by an episode of ''[[Sex and the City]],'' "Pick-A-Little, Talk-A-Little", in which [[Miranda Hobbes]] asks [[Carrie Bradshaw]]'s boyfriend, [[Jack Berger]], to analyze the post-date behavior of a potential love interest. Because the man declined Miranda's invitation to come up to her apartment after the date, stating that he has an early meeting, Berger concludes, "He's just not that into you", adding, "When a guy's really into you, he's coming upstairs, meeting or no meeting." The book authors, [[Greg Behrendt]] and [[Liz Tuccillo]], were writers on the show.

==Synopsis==
The book is a "self-help" guide aimed for single women. The premise of the book, as stated in the title, tells women readers that if a man in whom you are interested is not making the effort to pursue you, he is simply "just not that into you."

== Film ==
{{main|He's Just Not That Into You (film)}}

A film based on the book was released by [[New Line Cinema]] on February 6, 2009. Produced by [[Flower Films]] (Drew Barrymore's production company), filming was completed at the end of 2007. The film was released in theaters February 6, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.msn.com/movies/movie.aspx?m=2119539&amp;mp=syn |title=He's Just Not That Into You (2009) - Synopsis&amp;nbsp;— MSN Movies |publisher=Entertainment.msn.com |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Kwapis]] directed the film, which featured an all-star cast including [[Ben Affleck]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Kevin Connolly (actor)|Kevin Connolly]], [[Jennifer Connelly]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Ginnifer Goodwin]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], and [[Justin Long]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1001508/fullcredits#cast|title=IMDB for He's Just Not That Into You}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, it was a box office success, grossing over $180 million worldwide.

== In popular culture ==

The book appears in ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' episode "Pulp Friction", when [[Lorelai Gilmore]] prepares the Dragon Fly Inn's library for her interview and states that all of the good books are gone, leaving her with five copies of ''He's Just Not That Into You'', which she hands an employee to dispose of. The book was also referenced in the movie ''[[Zombieland]]'', in season two of ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]'' and in TV series "[[Vexed]]".

'''''The Apparition'' '''(French: L'Apparition) is a painting by French artist [[Gustave Moreau]], painted between 1874 and 1876. It shows the biblical character of [[Salome]] dancing in front of Herod Antipas with a vision of [[John the Baptist]]'s head. The 106&amp;nbsp;cm high and 72,2&amp;nbsp;cm wide watercolor held by the Paris [[Musee d'Orsay]] elaborates an episode told in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] 14:6-11 and [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 6:21-29.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On a feast on the occasion of [[Herod Antipas]]' birthday, the princess Salome dances in front of the king and his guest, pleasing him so much he promises her anything she wished for. Incited by her mother [[Herodias]], who was reproved by the imprisoned John the Baptist for her illegitimate marriage to [[Herodes|Herod]], Salome demands John's head in a [[charger (table setting)|charger]]. Regretful but compelled to keep his word in front of his peers, Herod fulfills Salome's demand. John the Baptist is beheaded, the head brought in a charger and given to Salome, who gives it to her mother.

Moreau approached the biblical theme in 19 paintings, 6 watercolors and more than 150 drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous-artists/gustave-moreau.htm|title = Art Encyclopedia: Visual Arts of Painting - Sculpture  - Architecture|date = 2014|accessdate = 30 December 2014|website = www.visual-arts-cork.com|publisher = Visual Arts Cork|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of a series of at least 8 closely resembling paintings and more than 40 sketch drawings, it is regarded a key work of Moreau's opus, [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] and ''[[fin de siècle]]'' art in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gustave Moreau, with a catalogue of the finished paintings, watercolors and drawings|last = Mathieu|first = Pierre-Louis|publisher = New York Graphic Society|year = 1976|isbn = 978-0821207017|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its first presentation 1876 in [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] (French: Salon de Paris), the painting caused a sensation. It has since made a lasting impression on various artists, notably from the [[Decadent movement]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Description ==
Against the backdrop of a lavishly decorated palace inspired by the Alhambra &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/graphic-arts/commentaire_id/the-apparition-11024.html?tx_commentaire_pi1%5BpidLi%5D=848&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5Bfrom%5D=845&amp;cHash=6df4efb7b5|title = Musee d'Orsay Collection - Works in Focus - Gustave Moreau: The Apparition|date = 2006|accessdate = 30 December 2014|website = www.musee-orsay.fr|publisher = Musee d'Orsay|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Salome stands out in an array of bejeweled veils, her body facing the viewer, her left arm pointing up in the air to John the Baptist's hovering head, enclosed by a halo. At the back in the half-light stands the executioner with his sword, at his feet the silver charger. Seated in ascending position on Salome's side are a lutanist, Herodias and Herod Antipas. They face the foreground events seemingly lit by John's halo and its reflections on Salome's costume. The severed head recalls a Japanese print copied by Moreau at the [[Palais de l'Industrie]] in 1869 as well as the severed head of [[Medusa]] as held by [[Benvenuto Cellini]]'s bronze [[Perseus|''Perseus with the head of Medusa'']] in [[Florence]] ([[Loggia dei Lanzi]]). Since no one, including Salome, reacts directly to the vision central to the composition, it is unclear if it is real, imagined by the princess or a collective hallucination. This deliberately confusing technique has been attributed to an alleged consumption of opium and thereby caused hallucinations, though justification of such claims was never established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/graphic-arts/commentaire_id/the-apparition-11024.html?tx_commentaire_pi1%5BpidLi%5D=848&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5Bfrom%5D=845&amp;cHash=6df4efb7b5|title = Gustave Moreau: The Apparition|date = 2006|accessdate = 30 December 2014|website = www.musee-orsay.fr|publisher = Musee D'orsay|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its surreal setting and mystic air, evoked by obscure architectural and textile opulence, contrast with previous interpretations of the subject, making ''The Apparition'' a key work for the emerging symbolist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Moreau's Materiality: Polymorphic Subjects, Degeneration, and Physicality|last = Slavkin|first = Mary|publisher = Electronic Theses, Treatises and Dissertations|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Florida State University|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belgian art dealer Léon Gauchez bought ''The Appariton'' in 1876 upon its first presentation at the Salon where it was exhibited with several other of Moreau's works''. ''The following year Gauchez sent it to be exhibited at London's [[Grosvenor Gallery]] where it hung not with the aquarelles in a separate room but in the main East Gallery with the oil paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Grosvenor Gallery: A Palace of Art in Victorian England|last = Casteras|first = Susan P.|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 1996|isbn = 9780300067521|location = Yale|pages = |last2 = Denney|first2 = Colleen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is located in the Musée d'Orsay.

=== Style ===
"The dreadful head grows eerily, bleeding all the while, so that clots of dark red form at the ends of hair and beard." (Joris-Karl Huysmans, A Rebours, Chap. VI. 1884)

''The Apparition'' stands apart from biblical and historic paintings of the period, incorporating elements of style which would become significant for the aesthetic and symbolist movement, while also anteceding surrealism.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Art of Gustave Moreau: Theory, Style, and Content|last = Kaplan|first = Julius|publisher = UMI Research Press|year = 1982|isbn = 978-0835713504|location = Ann Arbor, Michigan|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the bible mentions Salome as acting out Herodias' will, Moreau draws her guided by her own lust. Among his series of Salome-paintings, the climactic ''The Apparition'' is the most openly erotic with a bare-breasted princess turned towards the viewer, her naked arm directed at the object she will soon receive. By accentuating her stillness, Moreau immobilizes her to be seen alternately as idol or sexual object or both.&lt;ref name=":022"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Painting and the Novel|last = Meyers|first = Jeffry|publisher = Manchester University Press|year = 1975|isbn = |location = Manchester|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics also ascribed her statuesque posture to fear, like French writer [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] who muses on the painting in his influential decadent novel ''[[A rebours]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A rebours|last = Huysmans|first = Joris-Karl|publisher = Charpentier|year = 1884|isbn = |location = France|pages = 83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreau himself described Salome as "bored and fantastic woman, animal by nature and so disgusted with the complete satisfaction of her desires (that she) gives herself the sad pleasure of seeing her enemy degraded."&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt; His sensual presentation of Salome and innovative interpretation of traditional historic and mythological themes caused his art to be regarded as eccentric and provocative.&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://theculturetrip.com/europe/france/articles/gustave-moreau-reimagining-symbolism/|title = Gustave Moreau: Reimagining Symbolism|date = 2014|accessdate = 30 December 2014|website = www.theculturetrip.com|publisher = The Culture Trip|last = Kieffer|first = Michèle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasizing instincts over reason, subjectivity over objectivity and suggestion over definition, the watercolor features essential qualities of symbolism as coined by French poet and critic Jean Moréas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Symbolist Art|last = Edward|first = Lucie-Smith|publisher = Thames &amp; Hudson|year = 1972|isbn = 0500201250|location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the scene's morbidity and underlying themes of necrophilia, incest and sadism associate it with the decadent movement and Fin de siecle art. These disparate elements and the use of complex techniques like highlighting, graftage and incisions, create a sublime ideal of the orient. Excessive detail given to foreign costumes and background elements as strange mural reliefs on the pallast's columns proof characteristic for Moreau who's artistic style tending towards [[exoticism]] and [[orientalism]] was often referred to as "Byzanthine". Together with the mysterious titular vision they both evoke [[fantastic art]] and indicate his evolution towards [[fauvism]] and [[abstract painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = From Realism to Art Nouveau|last = Lombardi|first = Laura|publisher = Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|year = 2009|isbn = 9781402759260|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than being solely a character from academic painting Moreau remained bound to despite his avant-garde-tendencies, his Salome embodies the [[femme fatale]] from Victorian imagination who was equally seductive and destructive.&lt;ref name=":122"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Femme Fatale: Erotic Icon|last = Allen|first = Virginia M.|publisher = Whitson Publishing Company|year = 1983|isbn = |location = Troy, New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Defying conventions of historic and biblic painting, ''The Apparition'' became a source for [[surrealism]] as did others of Moreau's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Gustave_Moreau.aspx|title = Encyclopedia of World Biography|date = 2004|accessdate = 30 December 2014|website = www.encyclopedia.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motif ==
The events from which Moreau draws his scene are first described in two [[parallel passage]]s of the [[New Testament]].

"...And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom. And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist. And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her. And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother." ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 6:21-29, KJV)

A shorter version appears in the Gospel of St. Matthew:

"But on Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before them: and pleased Herod. Whereupon he promised with an oath, to give her whatsoever she would ask of him. But she being instructed before by her mother, said: Give me here in a dish the head of John the Baptist. And the king was struck sad: yet because of his oath, and for them that sat with him at table, he commanded it to be given. And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. And his head was brought in a dish: and it was given to the damsel, and she brought it to her mother." ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matt]] 14:6-11, D-R)

The unnamed dancer identified as Salome by scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 468858|title = Scandal and the Dance: Salome in the Gospel of Mark|last = Girard|first = Rene|date = 1984|journal = New Literary History Vol. 15, No. 2|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; has inspired numerous artist before Moreau, among them [[Masolino da Panicale]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], [[Titian]], [[Caravaggio]], [[Guido Reni]], [[Fabritius]], [[Henri Regnault]] and [[Georges Rochegrosse]]. Though classic academic subjects from religion and history were superseded by everyday scenes during the 19th century, Salome remained a figure of artistic interest,&lt;ref name=":122"/&gt; appearing in [[Heinrich Heine]]'s 1843 epic poem ''[[Atta Troll]]'', ''The Beheading of John the Baptist ''by'' ''Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, [[Jean-Baptiste Regnault]]'s ''eponymous oil painting ''and [[Arthur O'Shaughnessy]]'s 1870 poem ''The Daughter of Herodias. ''In his 1875 poem ''Salomé'', Henri Cazaliz's paid homage to Moreau's earlier Salome-paintings, musing on Salome’s feelings before and after the execution.&lt;ref name=":122"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Still, it were Moreau's ''The Apparition'' and its sister piece, an oil version also called ''The Apparition ''(1875) which sparked a Salome craze lasting into the 20th century, permeating all forms of art.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Impact ==
''The Apparition'' quickly became Moreau's best known work, its notoriety growing with the critical and artistic attention it received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = History as a theatre of cruelty: representation and theatricality in Flaubert’s Salammbô and Hérodias and in Gustave Moreau’s Salome paintings|last = Morris|first = Jean|publisher = University of North Carolina|year = 1994|isbn = |location = North Carolina|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous artist drew inspiration from Moreau's Salome, her mimesis infusing their works or insinuating itself in it. French poet Stephane Mallarme's envisions Salome in his ''Herodiade'' (1864 -1896) as the virgin-whore seen by many of Moreau's contemporaries&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Oscar Wilde|last = Ellmann|first = Richard|publisher = Vintage Books|year = 1988|isbn = 0394759842|location = Oxford|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The horror of my virginity &lt;br&gt;Delights me, and I would envelope me&lt;br&gt;In the terror of my tresses, that, by night,&lt;br&gt;Inviolate reptile, I might feel the white &lt;br&gt;And glimmering radiance of thy frozen fire,&lt;br&gt;Thou art chaste and diest of desire,&lt;br&gt;White night of ice and of the cruel snow!"&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Idols of Perversity: Fantasies of Feminine Evil in Fin-de-Siècle Culture|last = Dijkstra|first = Bram|publisher = Oxford Paperbacks|year = 1988|isbn = 978-0195056525|location = Oxford|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As André Fontainas noted 1928 in ''Mes souvenirs du Symbolisme'', many artists since responded to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Four French Symbolists: A Sourcebook on Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Gustave Moreau, Odilon Redon, and Maurice Denis|last = Clement|first = Russell T.|publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group|year = 1996|isbn = 9780313297526|location = United States|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent works influenced by the painting include:
* [[Jules Massenet]]'s ''[[Hérodiade|Herodiade]] ''(1877) 
* [[Odilon Redon]]'s ''Salome with the Head of John the Baptist'' and ''Apparition''  
* [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s short story ''[[Hérodias (short story)|Herodias]] from his [[Three Tales (Flaubert)|Three Tales]] '' 
* Famously, [[Oscar Wilde]] wrote his symbolist play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'' (1893) after being impressed by ''The Apparition ''viewing it 1884 at the Louvre&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
* [[Richard Strauss]]' [[Salome (opera)|opera ''Salome'']], based on Wilde's play 
* [[Antoine Mariotte]]'s opera ''Salome'', also based on Wilde's Salome
* [[Nick Cave]]'s theatrical dialogue ''Salome''
When the renown of its creator faded, ''The Apparition'' contained its prominent place in artistic imagination, its lasting impressiveness being crucial to the rediscovery of Moreau's art in the later 20th century.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Life==
Mathilde Danegger was born and attended school in [[Vienna]].   Her father was the [[Austria]]n character actor and stage producer {{Interlanguage link multi|Josef Danegger|de|3=Josef Danegger (Schauspieler, 1865)}} (real name, Joseph Deutsch: 1865–1933) who later took over as director of the [[Zürich Opera House|City Theatre]] in [[Zürich]].&lt;ref name=MDlautRS/&gt;   Her mother, Bertha Müller, was also a stage actress.&lt;ref name=MDlautwww/&gt;

Like her elder brothers {{Interlanguage link multi|Josef Danegger|de|3=Josef Danegger (Schauspieler, 1889)}} and [[Theodor Danegger]], she decided on a stage career early in life.   She started her performing with children's roles, making her debut in 1912 at [[Max Reinhardt]]'s [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theater]] in [[Berlin]], with a further youthful appearance there in 1914.&lt;ref name=MDlautRS/&gt;   She would continue to return to the Berlin stage throughout her career, but by 1919 she was, with her parents, based in [[Zürich]].   In 1919/1920 she had engagements at the [[Burgtheater|City Theatre]] in [[Vienna]].   From 1921 till 1924 she was working, primarily, at the [[Volkstheater, Vienna|Popular Theatre]] in Vienna, and between 1924 and 1928 at the [[Theater in der Josefstadt]].&lt;ref name=MDlautwww/&gt;

Mathilde Danegger's first marriage was to [[Herbert Waniek]] (1897 – 1949) whose theatre career during the 1920s was focused on the same Vienna theatres as those of his wife.   Waniek also had connections with the "German Theatre" at [[Brno]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], where until 1933 Mathilde Danegger was making regular guest appearances.   There were also frequent guest appearances at theatres in Berlin and Vienna.&lt;ref name=MDlautwww/&gt;   Around this time she also married her second husband, the Swiss drama producer [[Walter Lesch]] (1898 – 1958).&lt;ref name=MDlautwww/&gt;

With the German [[Machtergreifung|change in government]] at the start of 1933, Mathilde Danegger, a staunch antifascist, fled to [[Switzerland]] where she worked at the [[Schauspielhaus Zürich|National Theatre]] in [[Zürich]] with [[Wolfgang Langhoff]], like her a political exile from [[Nazi Germany]].   She took part in political cabaret, between 1934 and 1938 appearing in the "Cornichon" cabaret established by [[Walter Lesch|her husband]].&lt;ref name=MDlautwww/&gt;   In 1939 she got together with {{Interlanguage link multi|Herbert Crüger|de}} who subsequently became her third husband.&lt;ref name=MDlautwww/&gt;   She was also one of the founders in Switzerland of the [[National Committee for a Free Germany]].&lt;ref name=MDlautRS/&gt;

Two years after the war ended, in 1947, Mathilde Danegger returned to [[Germany]].   Sources differ as to whether she settled in the [[Allied-occupied Germany|American occupation zone]]&lt;ref name=MDlautwww/&gt; or in [[East Berlin]],&lt;ref name=MDlautRS/&gt; which was in the central part of what had been Germany, and was now [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|administered]] as part of the [[Soviet occupation zone]].   In reality, it was several years before the political division of occupied Germany would be matched by physical barriers.   Between 1947 and 1951 she was working at the [[Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden|Hessische National Theatre]] in [[Wiesbaden]].&lt;ref name=MDlautwww/&gt;   In East Berlin, supported by the dramatist's wife and business manager, [[Helene Weigel]]  Danegger was recruited by [[Bertolt Brecht]] to work at the [[Berliner Ensemble]] where she was employed between 1951 and 1953.&lt;ref name=MDlautRS/&gt;   During these years she was active in the peace movement.   In December 1948 she joined the [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]].   Between 1948 and 1951 she also wrote, as Cultural Editor, for "Unsere Stimme", a regional communist news magazine based near the frontier with Switzerland, at [[Villingen-Schwenningen|Schwenningen]].&lt;ref name=MDlautwww/&gt;

In 1953, four years after the foundation of two separate German states, and with the [[Inner German border|border between them]] becoming less permeable, she formally relocated with [[:de:Herbert Crüger|her husband]] to the [[German Democratic Republic|German Democratic Republic (East Germany)]].&lt;ref name=MDlautwww/&gt;   There followed a long period as a star of the [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theater]] in Berlin.   Among others, she took part in productions by [[Wolfgang Langhoff]], [[Wolfgang Heinz (actor)|Wolfgang Heinz]],  [[Benno Besson]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Adolf Dresen|de}}.&lt;ref name=MDlautwww/&gt;

In parallel with her theatre work, from 1960 she built up an extensive repertoire of cinema and television roles in productions by the state-owned film studio, [[DEFA (film studio)|DEFA]], and [[Deutscher Fernsehfunk]], the state television broadcaster.   She had already undertaken a significant amount of acting work in front of the camera during her time in Switzerland.   Of particular note was her portrayal of Frau Holle in the 1963 [[:de:Frau Holle (1963)|film of the eponymous fairy tale]] by [[Gottfried Kolditz]] and her television role in "Mutter Jantschowa" (1968).&lt;ref name=MDlautRS/&gt;

She remained politically engaged throughout.   In 1957 she wrote a letter to [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|the party]] defending dissident [[Wolfgang Harich]] following his arrest.&lt;ref name=MDlautwww/&gt;

==Family matters==
By her second husband she was the mother of the actress [[Karin Lesch]].&lt;ref name=KLlautKM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreihaselnuessefueraschenbroedel.de/mitwirkende/karin-lesch/|title=Karin Lesch   ...   Tochter der Schauspielerin Mathilde Danegger |publisher=Kathrin Miebach,  Meschede i.A. "Drei Haselnüsse für Aschenbrödel"|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her third husband, the university lecturer and author [[:de:Herbert Crüger|Herbert Crüger]], became caught up in the political persecution that was a feature of East Germany in the 1950s.   In 1956 he was overheard criticising the arrest of {{Interlanguage link multi|Bernhard Steinberger|de}} in the aftermath of the remarkable [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|the party conference]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]], and in March 1958 Crüger was himself arrested by the [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security (Stasi)]].   At a secret trial in December 1958 he was found guilty of "high treason" (''"schweren Staatsverrats"'') and sentenced to an eight-year jail term.   In the end he was released in 1961 and rehabilitated by the High Court in May 1990.&lt;ref name=HClautwww&gt;{{cite web|title=Crüger, Herbert  * 17.5.1911, † 17.1.2003  »Säuberungs«-Opfer|work="Wer war wer in der DDR?"|author=[[Bernd-Rainer Barth]]|publisher=Ch.

'''Melusine''' ({{IPA-fr|melyzin|lang}}) or '''Melusina''' is a figure of [[Europe]]an [[folklore]] and [[Mythology|mythology]] (mostly [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]]), a female [[spirit#Metaphysical and metaphorical uses|spirit]] of [[fresh water]] in a [[sacred spring]] or [[river]]. She is usually depicted as a woman who is a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] or [[fish]] from the waist down (much like a [[mermaid]]). She is also sometimes illustrated with wings, two tails, or both. Her legends are especially connected with the northern and western areas of [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], and the [[Low Countries]]. The [[House of Luxembourg]] (which ruled the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from AD 1308 to AD 1437 as well as [[Bohemia]] and [[Hungary]]), the Counts of Anjou and their descendants the [[House of Plantagenet]] (kings of England) and the French [[House of Lusignan]] (kings of [[Cyprus]] from AD 1205–1472, and for shorter periods over [[Armenia]] and [[Jerusalem]]) are said in folk tales and medieval literature to be descended from Melusine. 

One tale says Melusine herself was the daughter of the [[fairy]] Pressyne and king Elinas of [[Scotland|Albany]] (now known as Scotland). Melusine's mother leaves her husband, taking her daughters to the isle of [[Avalon]] after he breaks an oath never to look in at her and her daughter in their bath. The same pattern appears in stories where Melusine marries a nobleman only after he makes an oath to give her privacy in her bath; each time, she leaves the nobleman after he breaks that oath. [[Shapeshifting]] and flight on wings away from oath-breaking husbands also figure in stories about Melusine. According to [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] in ''Curious Tales of the Middle Ages'', the pattern of the tale is similar to the [[Knight of the Swan]] legend which inspired the character "[[Lohengrin]]" in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s ''[[Parzival]]''. &lt;ref name="S.Baring-Gould"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Curious Myths of the Middle Ages |last=Baring-Gould |first=Sabine |publisher=Roberts Brothers |year=1882 |location=Boston : |pages=343–393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary versions==
[[File:Bookofmelusine.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Raymond walks in on his wife, Melusine, in her bath and discovers she has the lower body of a serpent. Illustration from the [[Jean d'Arras]] work, ''Le livre de Mélusine'' (The Book of Melusine), 1478.]]
The most famous literary version of Melusine tales, that of [[Jean d'Arras]], compiled about 1382–1394, was worked into a collection of "spinning yarns" as told by ladies at their spinning coudrette ([[wikisource:fr:Couldrette|coulrette (in French)]]). He wrote ''The Romans of Partenay or of Lusignen: Otherwise known as the Tale of Melusine,'' giving source and historical notes, dates and background of the story. He goes into detail and depth about the relationship of Melusine and Raymondin, their initial meeting and the complete story.

The tale was translated into [[German language|German]] in 1456 by Thüring von Ringoltingen, which version became popular as a [[chapbook]]. It was later translated into [[English language|English]] c. 1500, and often printed in both the 15th century and the 16th century. A prose version is entitled the ''Chronique de la princesse'' (''Chronicle of the Princess'').

It tells how in the time of the Crusades, Elynas, the King of [[Alba]]ny (an old name for [[Scotland]] or [[Alba]]), went hunting one day and came across a beautiful lady in the forest. She was Pressyne, mother of Melusine. He persuaded her to marry him but she agreed, only on the promise—for there is often a hard and fatal condition attached to any pairing of [[fairy|fay]] and mortal—that he must not enter her chamber when she birthed or bathed her children. She gave birth to triplets. When he violated this taboo, Pressyne left the kingdom, together with her three daughters, and traveled to the lost Isle of [[Avalon]].

The three girls—Melusine, Melior, and Palatyne—grew up in Avalon. On their fifteenth birthday, Melusine, the eldest, asked why they had been taken to Avalon. Upon hearing of their father's broken promise, Melusine sought revenge. She and her sisters captured Elynas and locked him, with his riches, in a mountain. Pressyne became enraged when she learned what the girls had done, and punished them for their disrespect to their father. Melusine was condemned to take the form of a serpent from the waist down every Saturday. In other stories, she takes on the form of a mermaid.

Raymond of [[Poitou]] came across Melusine in a forest of Coulombiers in [[Poitou]] in [[France]], and proposed marriage. Just as her mother had done, she laid a condition: that he must never enter her chamber on a Saturday. He broke the promise and saw her in the form of a part-woman, part-serpent, but she forgave him. When, during a disagreement, he called her a "serpent" in front of his court, she assumed the form of a [[dragon]], provided him with two [[magic ring]]s, and flew off, never to return.&lt;ref&gt;[[Boria Sax]], ''The Serpent and the Swan: Animal Brides in Literature and Folklore''. Knoxville, TN: University of Tennessee Press/ McDonald &amp; Woodward, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Wandering Unicorn]]'' by [[Manuel Mujica Láinez]], Melusine tells her tale of several centuries of existence, from her original curse to the time of the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldcat.org/search?q=Wandering+Unicorn++Lainez&amp;qt=results_page Láinez, Manuel Mujica (1983) ''The Wandering Unicorn'' Chatto &amp; Windus, London] {{ISBN|0-7011-2686-8}};&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==
Melusine legends are especially connected with the northern areas of [[France]], [[Poitou]] and the [[Low Countries]], as well as [[Cyprus]], where the French [[Lusignan]] royal house that ruled the island from 1192 to 1489 claimed to be descended from Melusine. Oblique reference to this was made by Sir [[Walter Scott]] who told a Melusine tale in ''[[The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]'' (1802–1803) stating that
{{cquote|the reader will find the fairy of [[Normandy]], or [[Brittany|Bretagne]], adorned with all the splendour of Eastern description. The fairy Melusina, also, who married [[Guy de Lusignan]], Count of [[Poitou]], under condition that he should never attempt to intrude upon her privacy, was of this latter class. She bore the count many children, and erected for him a magnificent castle by her magical art. Their harmony was uninterrupted until the prying husband broke the conditions of their union, by concealing himself to behold his wife make use of her enchanted bath. Hardly had Melusina discovered the indiscreet intruder, than, transforming herself into a dragon, she departed with a loud yell of lamentation, and was never again visible to mortal eyes; although, even in the days of [[Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme|Brantome]], she was supposed to be the protectress of her descendants, and was heard wailing as she sailed upon the blast round the turrets of the [[Château de Lusignan|castle of Lusignan]] the night before it was demolished.}}

[[File:Melusine-Ludwig Michael von Schwanthaler-1845.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Melusine by [[Ludwig Michael von Schwanthaler]] (1845)]]
The [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg family]] also claimed descent from Melusine through their ancestor [[Siegfried of Luxembourg|Siegfried]].&lt;ref name="Women"&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[Philippa Gregory]] |author2=[[David Baldwin (historian)|David Baldwin]] |author3=[[Michael Jones (historian)|Michael Jones]] |title=[[The Women of the Cousins' War]]  |year=2011 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When in 963 A.D. Count Siegfried of the [[Ardennes]] (''Sigefroi'' in French; ''Sigfrid'' in Luxembourgish) bought the feudal rights to the territory on which he founded his capital city of [[Luxembourg]], his name became connected with the local version of Melusine. This Melusina had essentially the same magic gifts as the ancestress of the Lusignans, magically making the Castle of Luxembourg on the [[Bock (Luxembourg)|Bock]] rock (the historical center point of Luxembourg City) appear the morning after their wedding. On her terms of marriage, she too required one day of absolute privacy each week. Alas, Sigfrid, as the Luxem-bourgish call him, "could not resist temptation, and on one of the forbidden days he spied on her in her bath and discovered her to be a mermaid. When he let out a surprised cry, Melusina caught sight of him, and her bath immediately sank into the solid rock, carrying her with it. Melusina surfaces briefly every seven years as a beautiful woman or as a serpent, holding a small golden key in her mouth. Whoever takes the key from her will set her free and may claim her as his bride." In 1997 Luxembourg issued a postage stamp commemorating her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luxcentral.com/stamps/LuxStamps1997.html#Europa.1997 Luxembourg Stamps: 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] knew and believed in the story of another version of Melusine, ''die Melusina zu Lucelberg'' (Lucelberg in [[Silesia]]), whom he referred to several times as a [[succubus]] (''Works,'' Erlangen edition, volume 60, pp 37–42).  [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] wrote the tale of ''Die Neue Melusine'' in 1807 and published it as part of ''Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre.'' The playwright [[Franz Grillparzer]] brought Goethe's tale to the stage and [[Felix Mendelssohn]] provided a concert overture "The Fair Melusina," his Opus 32.

Melusine is one of the pre-Christian water-faeries {{citation needed|date=December 2013}} who were sometimes responsible for [[changeling]]s. The "[[Lady of the Lake]]", who spirited away the infant [[Lancelot]] and raised the child, was such a water nymph. Other European water sprites include [[Lorelei]] and the [[Neck (water spirit)|nixie]].

"Melusina" would seem to be an uneasy name for a girl-child in these areas of Europe, but [[Ehrengard Melusine von der Schulenburg, Duchess of Kendal and Munster]], mistress of [[George I of Great Britain]], was christened Melusine in 1667.

The chronicler [[Gerald of Wales]] reported that [[Richard I of England]] was fond of telling a tale according to which he was a descendant of a countess of Anjou who was in fact the fairy Melusine, concluding that his whole family "came from the devil and would return to the devil".&lt;ref&gt;[[Flori, Jean]] (1999), Richard Coeur de Lion: le roi-chevalier, Paris: Biographie Payot, {{ISBN|978-2-228-89272-8}} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Angevin legend told of an early Count of Anjou who met a beautiful woman when in a far land, where he married her. He had not troubled to find out about her origins. However, after bearing him four sons, the behaviour of his wife began to trouble the count. She attended church infrequently, and always left before the Mass proper. One day he had four of his men forcibly restrain his wife as she rose to leave the church. Melusine evaded the men and clasped the two youngest of her sons and in full view of the congregation carried them up into the air and out of the church through its highest window. Melusine and her two sons were never seen again. One of the remaining sons was the ancestor, it was claimed, of the later Counts of Anjou and the Kings of England.&lt;ref&gt;Huscroft, R. (2016) ''Tales From the Long Twelfth Century: The Rise and Fall of the Angevin Empire'', Yale University Press, pp. xix–xx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related legends==

''[[The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]'' recounts a legend about [[Hippocrates]]' daughter. She was transformed into a hundred-foot long [[dragon]] by the goddess [[Artemis|Diane]], and is the "lady of the manor" of an old castle. She emerges three times a year, and will be turned back into a woman if a knight kisses her, making the knight into her consort and ruler of the islands. Various knights try, but flee when they see the hideous dragon; they die soon thereafter. This appears to be an early version of the legend of Melusine.&lt;ref&gt;Christiane Deluz, ''Le livre de Jehan de Mandeville'', Leuven 1998, p. 215, as reported by Anthony Bale, trans., ''The Book of Marvels and Travels'', Oxford 2012, {{ISBN|0199600600}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KqonpxzxlFoC&amp;pg=PA15 p. 15] and footnote&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural interpretation==
[[Jacques Le Goff]] considered that Melusina represented a fertility figure: "she brings prosperity in a rural area...Melusina is the fairy of medieval economic growth".&lt;ref&gt;J. Le Goff, ''Time, Work and Culture in the Middle Ages'' (London 1982) p. 218-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Guermantes Way, for example, the narrator observes that the Lusignan family "was fated to become extinct on the day when the fairy Melusine should disappear" (Volume II, Page 5, Vintage Edition.).
* The story of Melusine (also called Melusina) was retold by [[Letitia Landon]] in the poem "The Fairy of the Fountains" in ''Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book'', 1834,&lt;ref&gt;Letitia Landon&lt;/ref&gt; and reprinted in her collection ''The Zenana''.

The '''Norwegian Society of Composers''' ({{lang-no|Norsk Komponistforening}}) was founded in 1917. The Society’s main objectives are to promote its members' music and secure their rights. 

As of today the Society counts 185 members who meet regularly for discussions and seminars. The Society works towards creating opportunities for the dissemination of contemporary music and for increasing public awareness of this art form. Contemporary music is promoted via several channels, including the society’s record label [[Aurora (record label)|Aurora]], and through collaboration with concert producers and festivals. 

The Society negotiates on behalf of its members in matters concerning remuneration and performing rights. It acts in an advisory capacity to the Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs and is represented on several boards (such as the Norwegian performing rights organization [[TONO]]) and public committees. The Norwegian Society of Composers offers legal, financial and practical aid to its members and provides information for the general public. 

Together with its sister organizations in the Nordic countries, the Norwegian Society of Composers arranges the annual festival [[Nordic Music Days]].

The '''Noël Coward Theatre''', formerly known as the '''Albery Theatre''', is a [[West End theatre]] on St. Martin's Lane in the [[City of Westminster]], London. It opened on 12 March 1903 as the '''New Theatre''' and was built by [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Sir Charles Wyndham]] behind [[Wyndham's Theatre]] which was completed in 1899. The building was designed by architect [[W. G. R. Sprague]] with an exterior in the [[classicism|classical]] style and an interior in the [[Rococo]] style.

In 1973 it was renamed the '''Albery Theatre''' in tribute to Sir [[Bronson Albery]] who had presided as its manager for many years. Since September 2005, the theatre has been owned by Delfont-Mackintosh Ltd. It underwent major refurbishment in 2006, and was renamed the '''Noël Coward Theatre''' when it re-opened for the London premiere of ''[[Avenue Q]]'' on 1 June 2006. [[Noël Coward]], one of Britain's greatest playwrights and actors, appeared in his own play, ''I'll Leave It To You'', at the then New Theatre in 1920, the first West End production of one of his plays.

The theatre seats 872 patrons on four levels. The building is now a Grade II [[Listed structure]].

==Notable productions==
After opening in 1903 with a production of ''Rosemary'' starring Charles Wyndham and his wife, Mary Moore (3 July 1861 – 6 April 1931), the Noël Coward Theatre has hosted a number productions. ''I'll Leave it to You'', in 1920, was Coward's first play. [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Saint Joan (play)|St. Joan]]'' with an acclaimed performance by actress [[Sybil Thorndike]] ran in 1924. 
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Gielgud Hamlet.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[John Gielgud]] directed and played the title role in a legendary production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' at the New Theatre in 1934.]] --&gt;

The 1930s saw the greatest commercial success of [[John Gielgud]]'s career, ''[[Richard of Bordeaux]]'' (1933). Gielgud followed up this triumph with a legendary production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in which he both played the title role and directed a company that included [[Jessica Tandy]], [[Jack Hawkins]] and a young [[Alec Guinness]] in one of his first professional roles as Osric. Gielgud also appeared with [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Peggy Ashcroft]] and [[Edith Evans]] in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. With [[the Blitz]] came the destruction of the theatres that were home to the [[Old Vic]] and [[Sadler's Wells]] Theatre Companies. Both companies made the New Theatre home until their respective theatres were rebuilt in the 1950s. One of the most successful shows to play the New Theatre opened 30 June 1960. It was [[Lionel Bart]]'s ''[[Oliver!]]'', which ran for 2,618 performances.

A 1970 [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] production of [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''[[London Assurance]]'', directed by [[Ronald Eyre]], with [[Donald Sinden]] as Sir Harcourt Courtly, (for which he received the 1975 [[Drama Desk Special Award]])&lt;ref name="Who 1981"&gt;Who's Who in the Theatre, 17th edition (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Rees]] as Charles, [[Judi Dench]] as Grace and [[Dinsdale Landen]] as Dazzle, transferred to the New Theatre in 1972 for a year, prior to its 1974 run in New York.

In 1981, ''[[Children of a Lesser God (play)|Children of a Lesser God]]'' won [[Olivier Award]]s for Best New Play and for actors [[Trevor Eve]] and Elizabeth Quinn. Among some of the 1980s productions is the 1994 revival of [[Turgenev]]'s ''[[A Month in the Country (play)|A Month in the Country]]'' starring [[Helen Mirren]] and [[John Hurt]].

In the 2000s the theatre has played host to several Shakespeare productions including a production of ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' set in India with an entirely Asian cast. The production played to packed houses and only closed as the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] themselves had exclusive rights to perform their annual London season of Tragedies there. Between December 2004 and April 2005, they presented ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Romeo &amp; Juliet]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'' and a brand new production of Euripides' ''[[Hecuba]]'' starring [[Vanessa Redgrave]].

On 8 June 2005, [[Dion Boucicault]]'s Victorian melodrama ''[[The Shaughraun]]'' opened; however, its success at the [[Dublin]] [[Gate Theatre]] was not repeated in London and it closed on 30 July. A dark period of around three months followed before the theatre was transferred to the ownership of Delfont Mackintosh Limited and reopened in October 2005 with [[The Right Size]]'s new production ''[[Ducktastic!]]''. Once again this failed to live up to expectations and closed just three weeks after opening on 19 November 2005. A short Christmas season of [[Patrick Stewart]]'s one-man version of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' played from 6 to 31 December 2005, before the theatre hosted the [[Edinburgh International Festival]] hit drama ''[[Blackbird (play)|Blackbird]]'' starring [[Roger Allam]]. The award-winning play Enron (directed by Rupert Goold, starring Samuel West and Tim Pigott-Smith) transferred here after a sellout run at the Royal Court. The European premiere of the Broadway hit, ''[[Avenue Q]]'', started previewing on 2 June 2006 and had its opening night on 28 June 2006, finally closing on 28 March 2009 prior to transferring to the [[Gielgud Theatre]].

Following a production of ''[[Deathtrap (play)|Deathtrap]]'', directed by [[Matthew Warchus]] and starring [[Simon Russell Beale]] and [[Jonathan Groff]], the theatre became the home of jukebox musical ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]'' in February 2011.

The '''Oxborough Dirk''' is a large ceremonial weapon or [[dirk]] from the early [[bronze age]]. One of only six such objects across [[Europe]], it was found in a rural part of the county of [[Norfolk]], England in the 1980s and is now part of the [[British Museum]]'s prehistoric collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=808195&amp;partId=1&amp;place=26449&amp;plaA=26449-3-2&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discovery==
It was found by chance in 1988 protruding from a [[peat]] bog near [[Oxborough]], [[Norfolk]], where it had been deposited point down. A walker had discovered it in woods near the village by accidentally tripping up on the [[hilt]] of the [[sword]]. Six years after its discovery, the sword was purchased by the British Museum with the support of the [[National Art Collections Fund]].

==Rare find==
The Oxborough find is one of only six large [[dirk]]s known in north-west Europe, though excessively large versions of other types of objects from this era are also recorded. The six are so similar that they may have been made in the same [[workshop]], in which case this one could have been imported in to [[Great Britain|Britain]] from the continent. The six almost identical swords have been found across three countries in western Europe: two in France, two in the Netherlands and two in England. All six of these very rare swords are labelled the [[Plougrescant]]-[[Ommerschans]] type, after two of the sites from where they were found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regiocanons.nl/overijssel/salland/ommen/bronsschat-ommerschans Dutch article on Ommerschans weapon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The others were discovered in [[Beaune]] and [[Jutphaas]] and a second from [[Norfolk]].  The [[Beaune]] example is also in the British Museum's collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=808153&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=beaune&amp;images=true&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;.  The second [[Norfolk]] example is in the collection of [[Norwich Castle Museum]].

==Description==
The Oxborough Dirk is dated to between 1450–1300 BC and measures {{convert|70.9|cm}} long with a mass of {{convert|2.37|kg}}, making it "ridiculously large and unwieldy" and clearly never intended for practical use, which the lack of holes on the hilt for fitting a handle also demonstrates.  It was probably either a [[votive offering]] or a [[store of value]] that could be retrieved at a later time.  It is currently on display in Room 50 at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1577">'''Quantum Aesthetics''' is a movement that was inaugurated by [[Gregorio Morales]] at the end of the 1990s with his work “El cadaver de Balzac” or ''[[Balzac]]'s Corpse'' (1998). Here he defined the objectives of the movement in the phrase “mystery and difference”.

Later the '''Quantum Aesthetics Group''' arose, formed by novelists, poets, painters, photographers, film producers, models… Gregorio Morales has applied these [[aesthetics]] not only to his novels, such as “Nómadas del Tiempo” or ''Nomads of Time'' (2005), but also to his poetry books such as “Canto Cuántico” or ''Quantum Song'' (2003). Here he enters emotively in the world of subatomic physics and the human mind. Other known artists in this movement are the painter [[Xaverio]], the poets [[Francisco Plata]] and [[Miguel Ángel Contreras]], the film director [[Julio Medem]] and the North American musician [[Lawrence Axerold]].

'''Red Peristyle''' ({{lang-hr|Crveni peristil}}) was an [[Urban Interventionism|urban intervention]] in [[Diocletian's Palace]] in the city of [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Croatia]], performed on 11 January 1968, when its [[peristyle]] (main court) was painted red.

A number of other actions were recognized as the work of the same artistic group.

This illegal attack on public property was made more controversial by the choice of the color. It was seen as an act of provocation towards [[communism]] in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]]. It was also prosecuted by the authorities as vandalism. Only one art historian, [[Cvito Fisković]], made a statement in defense of the artists. Two of them, Pave Dulčić and Tomo Ćaleta, committed suicide, whereas {{Interlanguage link multi|Nenad Đapić|de|3=Nenad Djapic}} and one other did not speak about the event. A myth of the Red Peristyle evolved and created a group of new "[[anti-heroes]]".

[[Image:RudkhanCastle.JPG|thumb|250px|Rudkhan Castle]]
'''Rudkhan Castle''' ({{lang-fa|قلعه رودخان}}, {{lang-glk|رودخان دژ}}); also '''Roodkhan Castle''', is a brick and stone medieval fortress in [[Iran]] that was built by the [[Gilaks]] to defend against the [[Arab]] invaders during the Arab/Islamic invasion of Sassanian Iran. With the fall of the [[Sassanid]] Empire, this area became a defensive position against the Arabs in the then-newly established [[Tabarestan]]. 

Located 25&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Fuman city]] north of Iran in [[Gilan province]], it is a [[military]] complex which had been constructed during the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] era (224-651), and later rebuilt during the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuq]] era by the [[Nizari Ismaili state|Nizari Ismailis]]. The castle is built on two tips of a mount, with an area of {{convert|2.6|ha}}. Its architects have benefited from natural mountainous features in the construction of the fort. 

The Rudkhan Castle River originates in the surrounding heights and flows from south to north. 

After crossing a mountainous winding route with dense forests, the first thing that one notices about the castle is its big entrance gate. 

Rudkhan Castle sits at the two peaks of a mountain at elevations of 715 and 670 metres and contains strong fortifications and battlements at a length of 1,550 metres. The castle's 42 towers still stand intact.

[[File:Al Hodge Don Hastings Captain Video.JPG|thumb|275px|A scene from the early American science fiction television program ''[[Captain Video]]'' which aired from 1949 to 1955]]

[[Science fiction]] first appeared in [[television program]]ming in the late 1930s, during what is called the [[Golden Age of Science Fiction]]. [[Special effects]] and other production techniques allow creators to present a living visual image of an imaginary world not limited by the constraints of reality.

==Science fiction television production process and methods==
The need to portray imaginary settings or characters with properties and abilities beyond the reach of current reality obliges producers to make extensive use of specialized techniques of television production.

Through most of the 20th century, many of these techniques were expensive and involved a small number of dedicated craft practitioners, while the reusability of props, models, effects, or animation techniques made it easier to keep using them. The combination of high initial cost and lower maintenance cost pushed producers into building these techniques into the basic concept of a series, influencing all the artistic choices.

By the late 1990s, improved technology and more training and cross-training within the industry made all of these techniques easier to use, so that directors of individual episodes could make decisions to use one or more methods, so such artistic choices no longer needed to be baked into the series concept.

===Special effects===
{{Main article|Special effect}}
[[File:Magicam-patent.png|thumb|301px|For the series ''[[The Starlost]]'', the Magicam, a servo controlled dolly along with a secondary periscope camera filming a model background, was designed by [[Douglas Trumbull]]. However, the system did not work reliably and [[Chroma key|blue screen]] effects were used.&lt;ref name="sf"&gt;{{cite book|title=Science Fiction Television Series|author1=Mark Phillips |author2=Frank Garcia |publisher=McFarland}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Special effects (or "SPFX") have been an essential tool throughout the history of science fiction on television: small explosives to simulate the effects of various [[raygun]]s, [[squib (explosive)|squib]]s of blood and gruesome prosthetics to simulate the monsters and victims in horror series, and the [[wire-flying]] entrances and exits of [[George Reeves]] as [[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Superman]].

The broad term "special effects" includes all the techniques here, but more commonly there are two categories of effects. [[Visual effects]] ("VFX") involve photographic or digital manipulation of the onscreen image, usually done in [[post-production]]. Mechanical or [[physical effects]] involve props, pyrotechnics, and other physical methods used during [[principal photography]] itself. Some effects involved a combination of techniques; a ray gun might require a pyrotechnic during filming, and then an optical glowing line added to the film image in post-production. [[Stunt]]s are another important category of physical effects. In general, all kinds of special effects must be carefully planned during [[pre-production]].

===Computer-generated imagery===
{{Main article|Computer-generated imagery}}

''[[Babylon 5]]'' was the first series to use [[computer-generated imagery]], or "CGI", for all exterior space scenes, even those with characters in space suits. The technology has made this more practical, so that today models are rarely used. In the 1990s, CGI required expensive processors and customized applications, but by the 2000s (decade), computing power has pushed capabilities down to personal laptops running a wide array of software.

===Models and puppets===
{{Main article|Scale model|Puppet}}

[[Scale model|Models]] have been an essential tool in science fiction television since the beginning, when [[Buck Rogers]] took flight in spark-scattering spaceships wheeling across a matte backdrop sky. The original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' required a staggering array of models; the [[Starship Enterprise|USS ''Enterprise'']] had to be built in several different scales for different needs. Models fell out of use in filming in the 1990s as CGI became more affordable and practical, but even today, designers sometimes construct scale models which are then digitized for use in animation software.

Models of characters are [[puppet]]s. [[Gerry Anderson]] created a series of shows using puppets living in a universe of models and miniature sets, notably ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''. ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'' depicted an alien living in a family, while ''[[Farscape]]'' included two puppets as regular characters. In ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', the [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]] characters are puppets in scenes where they are sitting, standing, or lying down. In ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', the characters of [[Crow T. Robot]] and [[Tom Servo]], two of the show's main (and most iconic) characters, are puppets constructed from random household items.

===Animation===
{{Main article|Animation}}
{{See also|Anime}}
[[File:Kuha2053108.JPG|thumb|Robot characters from the Japanese science fiction television series  ''[[Ganbare!! Robocon]]''  were used to decorate this train car.]]
As animation is completely free of the constraints of gravity, momentum, and physical reality, it is an ideal technique for science fiction and fantasy on television. In a sense, virtually all animated series allow characters and objects to perform in unrealistic ways, so they are almost all considered to fit within the broadest category of speculative fiction (in the context of awards, criticism, marketing, etc.) The artistic affinity of animation to [[comic books]] has led to a large amount of [[superhero]]-themed animation, much of this adapted from comics series, while the impossible characters and settings allowed in animation made this a preferred medium for both [[fantasy]] and for series aimed at young audiences.

Originally, animation was all hand-drawn by artists, though in the 1980s, beginning with ''[[Captain Power]]'', computers began to automate the task of creating repeated images; by the 1990s, hand-drawn animation became defunct.

====Animation in live-action====
In recent years as technology has improved, this has become more common, notably since the development of the Massive software application permits producers to include hordes of non-human characters to storm a city or space station. The robotic [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylons]] in the new version of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' are usually animated characters, while the [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]] in ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' are animated when they are shown walking around or more than one is on screen at once.

==Science fiction television economics and distribution==
In general, science fiction series are subject to the same financial constraints as other television shows. However, high production costs increase the financial risk, while limited audiences further complicate the business case for continuing production. ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' was the first television series to cost more than $100,000 per episode, while ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' was the first to cost more than $1 million per episode.

The innovative nature of science fiction means that new shows cannot rely on predictable market-tested formulas like [[legal drama]]s or [[sitcom]]s; the involvement of creative talent outside the Hollywood mainstream introduces more variables to the budget forecasts.

In the past, science fiction television shows have maintained a family friendly format that rendered them suitable for all ages, especially children, as the majority of them were of the action-adventure format. This enabled merchandising such as toy lines, animated cartoon adaptations, and other licensing. However, many modern shows include a significant amount of adult themes (such as sexual situations, nudity, profanity and graphic violence) rendering them unsuitable for young audiences, and severely limiting the remaining audience demographic and the potential for merchandising.

The perception, more than the reality, of science fiction series being cancelled unreasonably is greatly increased by the attachment of fans to their favorite series, which is much stronger in [[science fiction fandom]] than it is in the general population. While mainstream shows are often more strictly episodic, where ending shows can allow viewers to imagine that characters live happily, or at least normally, ever after, science fiction series generate questions and loose ends that, when unresolved, cause dissatisfaction among devoted viewers. Creative settings also often call for broader story arcs than is often found in mainstream television, requiring science fiction series many episodes to resolve an ongoing major conflict. Science fiction television producers will sometimes end a season with a dramatic [[cliffhanger]] episode to attract viewer interest, but the short-term effect rarely influences financial partners. ''[[Dark Angel (2000 TV series)|Dark Angel]]'' is one of many shows ending with a cliffhanger scene that left critical questions open when the series was cancelled.

==Media fandom==
{{Main article|Media fandom}}
{{See also|science fiction fandom|Trekkie}}
[[File:Star Trek Federation Officers.jpg|thumb|px=250|Fans at a science fiction convention dressed as characters from ''[[Star Trek]]'']]
One of the earliest forms of media fandom was [[Star Trek fandom]]. Fans of the series became known to each other through the [[science fiction fandom]]. In 1968, [[NBC]] decided to cancel ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. [[Bjo Trimble]] wrote letters to contacts in the National Fantasy Fan Foundation, asking people to organize their local friends to write to the network to demand the show remain on the air. Network executives were overwhelmed by an unprecedented wave of correspondence, and they kept the show on the air. Although the series continued to receive low ratings and was canceled a year later, the enduring popularity of the series resulted in [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] creating a set of movies, and then a new series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', which by the early 1990s had become one of the most popular dramas on American television.

Although somewhat smaller, ''[[Doctor Who]]'' fandom considerably predates ''Star Trek'' fandom. Meanwhile, ''Star Trek'' fans continued to grow in numbers, and began organizing conventions in the 1970s. No other show attracted a large organized following until the 1990s, when ''[[Babylon 5]]'' attracted both ''Star Trek'' fans and a large number of literary SF fans who previously had not been involved in media fandom. Other series began to attract a growing number of followers.

In the late 1990s, a market for celebrity autographs emerged on [[eBay]], which created a new source of income for actors, who began to charge money for autographs that they had previously been doing for free. This became significant enough that lesser-known actors would come to conventions without requesting any appearance fee, simply to be allowed to sell their own autographs (commonly on publicity photos). Today most events with actor appearances are organized by commercial promoters, though a number of fan-run conventions still exist, such as [[Toronto Trek]] and [[Shore Leave (convention)|Shore Leave]].

The 1985 series ''[[Robotech]]'' is most often credited as the catalyst for the Western interest in anime. The series inspired a few fanzines such as ''Protoculture Addicts'' and ''Animag'' both of which in turn promoted interest in the wide world of anime in general. Anime's first notable appearance at SF or comic book conventions was in the form of video showings of popular anime, untranslated and often low quality VHS bootlegs. Starting in the 1990s, [[anime]] fans began organizing conventions. These quickly grew to sizes much larger than other science fiction and media conventions in the same communities; many cities now have anime conventions attracting five to ten thousand attendees. Many anime conventions are a hybrid between non-profit and commercial events, with volunteer organizers handling large revenue streams and dealing with commercial suppliers and professional marketing campaigns.

For decades, the majority of science fiction media fandom has been represented by males of all ages and for most of its modern existence, a fairly diverse racial demographic. The most highly publicized demographic for science fiction fans is the male adolescent; roughly the same demographic for American [[comic book]]s. Female fans, while always present, were far fewer in number and less conspicuously present in fandom. With the rising popularity of fanzines, female fans became increasingly vocal. Starting in the 2000s (decade), genre series began to offer more prominent female characters. Many series featured women as the main characters with males as supporting characters. ''[[True Blood]]'' is an example. Also, such shows premises moved away from heroic [[Action (fiction)|action-adventure]] and focused more on characters and their relationships. This has caused the rising popularity of [[fanfiction]], a large majority of which is categorized as [[slash fanfiction]]. Female fans comprise the majority of fanfiction writers.

{{Main article|British television science fiction}}

'''British television science fiction''' began in 1938 when the broadcast medium was in its infancy with the transmission of a partial adaptation of Karel Čapek's [[R.U.R.]]. Despite an occasionally chequered history, popular programmes in the genre have been produced by both the [[BBC]] and the largest commercial channel, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. ''[[Doctor Who]]'' is listed in the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the longest-running [[science fiction]] television show in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Canadian science fiction television===
{{Main article|Canadian science fiction television}}

Science fiction in [[Canada]] was produced by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] as early as the 1950s. In the 1970s, [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] produced ''[[The Starlost]]''. In the 1980s, Canadian animation studios including [[Nelvana]], began producing a growing proportion of the world market in animation.

In the 1990s, Canada became an important player in live action speculative fiction on television, with dozens of series like ''[[Forever Knight]]'', ''[[Robocop: The Series|Robocop]]'', and most notably ''[[The X-Files]]'' and ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''. Many series have been produced for youth and children's markets, including ''[[Deepwater Black]]'' and ''[[MythQuest]]''.

In the first decade of the 21st century, changes in provincial tax legislation prompted many production companies to move from Toronto to [[Vancouver]]. Recent popular series produced in Vancouver include ''[[The Dead Zone (TV series)|The Dead Zone]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'', ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', ''[[Stargate Universe]]'', ''[[The 4400]]'', ''[[Sanctuary (TV series)|Sanctuary]]'' and the reimagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''.

Because of the small size of the domestic television market, most Canadian productions involve partnerships with production studios based in the United States and Europe. However, in recent years, new partnership arrangements are allowing Canadian investors a growing share of control of projects produced in Canada and elsewhere.

===Australian science fiction television===
{{Main article|Australian science fiction television}}

Australia's best known Science Fiction series was ''[[Farscape]]''; made with American co-production, it ran from 1999 to 2003. Early series made in the 1960s included ''[[The Interparis]]'' (1968) ''[[Vega 4 (TV series)|Vega 4]]'' (1967), and ''[[Phoenix Five]]'' (1970).  A significant proportion of Australian produced Science Fiction programmes are made for the teens/young Adults market, including ''[[The Girl from Tomorrow]]'', the long-running ''[[Mr. Squiggle]]'', ''[[Halfway Across the Galaxy and Turn Left]]'', ''[[Ocean Girl]]'', ''[[Crash Zone]]'', ''[[Watch This Space]]'' and ''[[Spellbinder (TV series)|Spellbinder]]''.

Other series like ''[[Time Trax]]'', ''[[Roar (U.S. TV series)|Roar]]'', and ''[[Space: Above and Beyond]]'' were filmed in Australia, but used mostly US crew and actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magicdragon.com/UltimateSF/tv.html|title=TV page of ULTIMATE SCIENCE FICTION WEB GUIDE|first=Jonathan Vos|last=Post|website=www.magicdragon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese television science fiction===
{{Main article|History of anime|Tokusatsu}}
Japan has a long history of producing science fiction series for television. Some of the most famous are [[anime]] such as [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s ''[[Astro Boy]]'', the [[Super Robot]]s such as [[Mitsuteru Yokoyama]]'s ''[[Tetsujin 28-go]]'' (''[[Gigantor]]'') and [[Go Nagai]]'s ''[[Mazinger Z]]'', and the [[Real Robot]]s such as [[Yoshiyuki Tomino]]'s ''[[Gundam]]'' series and [[Shōji Kawamori]]'s ''[[Macross]]'' series.

Other primary aspects of Japanese science fiction television are the [[superhero fiction|superhero]] ''[[tokusatsu]]'' (a term literally meaning [[special effects]]) series, pioneered by programs such as ''[[Moonlight Mask]]'' and ''[[Planet Prince]]''. The [[suitmation]] technique has been used in long running franchises include [[Eiji Tsuburaya]]'s [[Ultra Series]], [[Shotaro Ishinomori]]'s [[Kamen Rider Series]], and the [[Super Sentai]] Series.

In addition, several [[Japanese television drama|dramas]] utilize science fiction elements as framing devices, but are not labeled as "tokusatsu" as they do not utilize actors in full body suits and other special effects.

===Continental European science fiction series===

==== Northern European series ====
Among the notable German language productions is  ''[[Lexx]]'' and {{lang|de|[[Raumpatrouille]]}}, a German series first broadcast in 1966. Movies by [[Rainer Erler]], include the miniseries {{lang|de|[[Das Blaue Palais]]}}.&lt;br&gt;
''[[Star Maidens]]'' (1975, aka "Medusa" or "Die Mädchen aus dem Weltraum") was a British-German coproduction of pure SF. Danish television broadcast the children's TV-series ''[[Crash (1984 TV series)|Crash]]'' in 1984 about a boy who finds out that his room is a space ship.

Early Dutch television series were ''[[:nl:Morgen gebeurt het|Morgen gebeurt het]]'' (Tomorrow it will happen), broadcast from 1957 to 1959, about a group of Dutch space explorers and their adventures, ''De duivelsgrot'' (The devil's cave), broadcast from 1963 to 1964, about a scientist who finds the map of a cave that leads to the center of the earth and ''Treinreis naar de Toekomst'' (Train journey to the future) about two young children who are taken to the future by robots who try to recreate humanity, but are unable to give the cloned humans a soul. All three of these television series where aimed mostly at children.

Later television series were ''Professor Vreemdeling'' (1977) about a strange professor who wants to make plants speak and ''[[:nl:Zeeuws Meisje (televisie)|Zeeuws Meisje]]'' (1997) a nationalistic post-apocalyptic series where the Netherlands has been built full of housing and the highways are filled with traffic jams.

Another French-produced science fiction series was the [[new age]] animated series {{lang|fr|Il était une fois... l'espace}} ({{lang-en|Once upon a time...space}}).  [[Anime-influenced animation]] includes a series of French-Japanese [[cartoon]]s/[[anime]], including such titles as ''[[Ulysses 31]]'' (1981), ''[[The Mysterious Cities of Gold]]'' (1982), and  ''[[Ōban Star-Racers]]'' (2006).

Only 11 episodes were filmed. The 70s saw three important television films, ''Los pajaritos'' (1974), ''La Gioconda está triste'' (1977), and ''[[La cabina]]'' (1972), this last one, about a man who becomes trapped in a telephone booth, while passersby seem unable to help him, won the 1973 [[International Emmy Award]] for Fiction.&lt;ref name=Jimenez2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20120218/ciencia-ficcion-genero-tan-raro-cine-espanol-como-estimulante/498557.shtml|title=La ciencia ficción, un género tan raro en el cine español como estimulante|first=Jesús |last=Jiménez|access-date=13 February 2016|date=18 February 2012|language=es|website=rtve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Wright of Derby. The Widow of an Indian Chief Watching the Arms of Her Deceased Husband.1785..jpg|thumb|right|''[[Indian Widow]]'' was exhibited at the first recorded solo exhibition of art in Britain, held by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] during 1785]]
A '''solo show''' or '''solo exhibition''' is an [[art exhibition|exhibition]] of the work of only one artist. The artwork may be paintings, drawings, [[etching]]s, [[collage]], sculpture, or photography. The creator of any artistic technique may be the subject of a solo show. Other skills and crafts have similar types of shows for the creators. Having solo shows of one's artwork marks the achievement of success and usually is accompanied by receptions and a great deal of publicity. The show may be of current work being produced, those from a single time period, or representative work from different periods in the career of the artist, the latter is termed a ''retrospective''. 

==History==
Art exhibitions have [[Art exhibition#History of art exhibitions|a history]] that dates back to 1623. It is thought that the first solo exhibition in Britain was staged by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] in 1785,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/online/featuredartists/josephwrightderby/ Joseph Wright of Derby], Liverpool Museums, accessed March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the year after he refused to become a [[Royal Academy|Royal Academician]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/873542 Two companion pieces by Wright of Derby], B. Nicholson, accessed March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Galleries became numerous in large cities during the nineteenth century and flourished during the twentieth century, often becoming included among [[Retailing|stores]] in small towns as well, after the middle of the twentieth century.

Generally, as artists begin to show their work they are accepted by commercial gallery owners for display among the works of many or among others who work in the same area. The works of the artists are sold and the galleries take commissions. As artists gain stature and attract a following who will purchase their works in greater numbers, gallery owners will promote their works in solo shows with a great deal of publicity about the show. The artists with the greatest appeal to a gallery's clients may be invited to be represented by that gallery consistently, developing a constant relationship that even may develop into exclusive rights to offer the sale of the works by those artists.

Once artists become recognized for their skills among critics and collectors through representation at galleries, museum directors and staff members may begin to purchase the works of the artists for [[museum collection]]s. Museums also hold exhibitions that change regularly and may choose to feature a solo show of the works of an artist as one of these exhibitions. Works that are gathered on loan from many other museums or collectors also may be scheduled for exhibition at one museum as a solo show. Planning for the exhibitions is a long process. Museums schedule their exhibitions for a given year well in advance and their negotiations may begin years before the shows are held. 

Some artists create a large number of works that they reserve as a traveling exhibition that generates income for them as they travel around the world for decades as solo shows at museums and galleries. Typically, the contract arrangements for booking such a large exhibition are that the hosting organization pays a fee to the artist, arranges for the safe delivery, set up, and return of the exhibition, and it charges admission to those attracted to the exhibition by extensive publicity generated by the host and approved by the artist. 

The term "one-man show" was used at times to describe these art exhibitions, but has fallen out of favor, even though the term "[[one-man show]]" persists to describe a solo performance among some entertainment venues and [[performing arts]].

      <comment>/* Perceptions */ none of those portray the events as having a scripted outcome, which is the key characteristic of sports entertainment. Much if this section is, however, nothing more that a laundry list of appearances, purportedly indicating some perception which is not sourced and therefore is [[WP:SYNTH]]. It's removal is justified.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4067">'''Sports entertainment''' is a type of [[spectacle]] which presents an ostensibly [[competition|competitive]] event using a high level of [[theatre|theatrical]] flourish and extravagant presentation, with the purpose of [[entertainment|entertaining]] an [[audience]]. Unlike typical [[sport]]s and games, which are conducted for [[competition]], [[sportsmanship]], [[physical exercise]] or personal [[recreation]], the primary product of sports entertainment is performance for an audience's benefit, thus they are never practiced privately. Commonly, but not in all cases, the outcomes are predetermined; as this is an [[open secret]], it is not considered to be [[match fixing]].

==History==
The term "sports entertainment" was coined by [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) chairman [[Vince McMahon]] during the 1980s as a [[List of marketing terms|marketing term]] to describe the industry of [[professional wrestling]], primarily to potential advertisers,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/stephanie-mcmahon-explains-sports-entertainment-was-created-advertisers&lt;/ref&gt; although precursors date back to February 1935, when ''[[Toronto Star]]'' sports editor [[Lou Marsh]] described professional wrestling as "sportive entertainment". In 1989 WWF used the phrase in a case it made to the New Jersey Senate for classifying professional wrestling as "sports entertainment" and thus not subject to regulation like a directly [[Sports competition|competitive sport]].

Some sports entertainment events represent variants of actual [[sport]]s, such as exhibition [[basketball]] with the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. Others modify sport for entertainment purposes: many types of professional wrestling (which derived from traditional [[wrestling]]), and more recently many of the various [[mascot race]]s held at numerous [[Major League Baseball]] games in-between innings.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10170/1066854-63.stm |title=Out at the plate: Pirates dump outspoken pierogi - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=2012-07-03 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some forms of sports entertainment involve taking competitive games usually considered minor, such as [[dodgeball]], [[poker]], or [[rock-paper-scissors]], and televising them with trumped-up theatrics, involving (for example) [[celebrity]] competitors or elaborate audiovisual packages.

==Perceptions==
Sports entertainment has a stigma of being mindless pop culture, in some cases glorifying violence for the sake of entertainment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pro-fane|url=http://www.americanpopularculture.com/archive/tv/pro_wrestling.htm|work=Americana|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been criticized as such in popular media, often through lampooning.

Many notable names in the [[United States]] openly admit enjoying certain forms of sports entertainment while many others have taken part in it or made paid contributions. Professional [[basketball]] player [[Shaquille O'Neal]] has a reputation as a long time pro wrestling fan and attends [[WWE]] events several times per year, and [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]] expressed interest in fulfilling a WWE career after he retires from professional [[boxing]]. Both worked [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuds]] with [[Big Show]], Mayweather's culminating in a featured match at [[WrestleMania XXIV]]. Former [[American football]] player [[Brian Urlacher]] made an attempt to leave football to wrestle for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] full-time until his team at the time, the [[Chicago Bears]], forced him to stop. Mixed martial artists [[Brock Lesnar]], [[Bobby Lashley]] and [[Dan Severn]] have been booked as pro wrestling world heavyweight champions; [[David Arquette]] was briefly [[WCW World Heavyweight Champion]], as part of a [[Ready to Rumble|cross-promotional movie deal]].

'''''The Brood''''' is a 1979 Canadian [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[psychological horror|psychological horror film]] written and directed by [[David Cronenberg]], and starring [[Oliver Reed]], [[Samantha Eggar]], and [[Art Hindle]]. The film follows a man uncovering an eccentric psychologist's therapy techniques on his institutionalized wife, amidst a series of brutal murders committed from an offspring of mutant children that coincides with the investigation. The film's soundtrack was composed by [[Howard Shore]], in his film score debut.

Released in 1979 from [[New World Pictures]], the film initially received mixed reviews from critics. Over the years, later reviews were more favourable regarding the film.

==Plot==
Psychotherapist Hal Raglan runs the Somafree Institute where he performs a technique called "psychoplasmics", encouraging patients with mental disturbances to let go of their suppressed emotions through physiological changes to their bodies. One of his patients is Nola Carveth, a severely disturbed woman who is legally embattled with her husband Frank for custody of their five-year-old daughter Candice. When Frank discovers bruises and scratches on Candice following a visit with Nola, he informs  Raglan of his intent to stop visitation rights. Wanting to protect his patient, Raglan begins to intensify the sessions with Nola to resolve the issue quickly. During the therapy sessions, Raglan discovers that Nola was physically and verbally abused by her self-pitying alcoholic mother, and neglected by her co-dependent alcoholic father, who refused to protect Nola out of shame and denial. Meanwhile, Frank, intending to invalidate Raglan's methods, questions Jan Hartog, a former Somafree patient dying of psychoplasmic-induced [[lymphoma]].

Frank leaves Candice with her grandmother, Juliana, and the two spend the evening viewing old photographs. Later, Juliana informs Candice that Nola was frequently hospitalized as a child, and often exhibited strange unexplained [[Wheal response#Morphology|wheals]] on her skin that doctors were unable to diagnose. While returning to the kitchen, Juliana is attacked and bludgeoned to death by a small, dwarf-like child. Candice is traumatized, but otherwise unharmed.

Juliana's ex-husband Barton returns for the funeral, and attempts to contact Nola at Somafree, but Raglan turns him away. Frank invites his daughter's teacher Ruth Mayer home for dinner to discuss Candice, but Barton interrupts with a drunken phone call from Juliana's home, demanding that they both go to Somafree in force to see Nola. Frank leaves to console Barton, leaving Candice in Ruth's care. While he is away, Ruth accidentally answers a phone call from Nola, who, recognizing her voice and believing her to be carrying on an affair with Frank, insults her and angrily warns her to stay away from her family. Frank arrives to find Barton murdered by the same deformed dwarf-child, who dies after attempting to kill Frank.

The police autopsy reveals a multitude of bizarre anatomical anomalies: the creature is [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]], supposedly color-blind, naturally [[Edentulism|toothless]], and devoid of a navel, indicating no known means of natural human birth. After the murder story reaches the newspapers, Raglan reluctantly acknowledges that the murders coincide with his sessions with Nola relating to their respective topics. He closes Somafree and sends his patients to municipal care with the exception of Nola.

Frank is alerted of the closure of Somafree by Hartog. Mike, one of the patients forced to leave the institute, tells Frank that Nola is Raglan's "queen bee" and in charge of some "disturbed children" in an attic. When Candice returns to school, two dwarf children attack and kill Ruth in front of her class, and abscond with Candice to Somafree. Frank immediately ventures to Somafree. Raglan tells him the truth about the dwarf children: they are the accidental product of Nola's psychoplasmic sessions; Nola's rage about her abuse was so strong that she [[Parthenogenesis|parthenogenetically]] bore a brood of children who psychically respond and act on the targets of her rage, with Nola completely unaware of their actions. Realizing the brood are too dangerous to keep anymore, Raglan plots to venture into their quarters and rescue Candice, provided that Frank can keep Nola calm to avoid provoking the children.

Frank attempts a feigned rapprochement long enough for Raglan to collect Candice, but when he witnesses Nola give birth to another child through a psychoplasmically-induced external womb, she notices his disgust. The brood awakens and kills Raglan. Nola then threatens to kill Candice rather than lose her. The brood goes after Candice who hides in a closet, but the brood begins to break through the door and try to grab her. In desperation, Frank chokes Nola to death, and the brood dies without its mother's psychic connection. Frank carries Candice back to his car and they drive off, but it is hinted that the events she endured result in the same phenomenon her mother experienced: a pair of small bumps are seen growing on her arm.

==Production==
''The Brood'' was filmed in [[Toronto]] and [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]],&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078908 ''The Brood''] in the [[Internet Movie Database]].&lt;/ref&gt; on a budget of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]1,500,000. It was a financial success, and executive producer Victor Solnicki (who also produced Cronenberg's ''[[Scanners]]'' and ''[[Videodrome]]'') called it his favorite Cronenberg picture. Cronenberg called it the most classic horror film he did, and, together with ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'' and ''[[Dead Ringers (film)|Dead Ringers]]'', one of his most autobiographical. At the time ''The Brood'' was developed, Cronenberg fought for custody of his daughter from his first marriage.&lt;ref name="coc" /&gt;

This was the first film scored by composer [[Howard Shore]]. Shore has written the music for all but one of Cronenberg's subsequent films.&lt;ref name="imdbShore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006290/|title=Howard Shore|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Brood'' had cuts demanded for its theatrical release in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom. Actress [[Samantha Eggar]] conceived of the idea of licking the new fetuses that her character Nola Carveth has spawned. "I just thought that when cats have their kittens or dogs have puppies (and I think at that time I had about 8 dogs), they lick them as soon as they’re born. Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick…," Eggar said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.terrortrap.com/interviews/samanthaeggar/|title=Collecting Life: An Interview with Samantha Eggar - July 2014|publisher=The Terror Trap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when the climactic scene was censored, Cronenberg responded: "I had a long and loving close-up of Samantha licking the fetus […] when the censors, those animals, cut it out, the result was that a lot of people thought she was eating her baby. That's much worse than I was suggesting."&lt;ref name="coc"&gt;Chris Rodley (ed.), ''Cronenberg on Cronenberg'', Faber &amp; Faber, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[MGM]] [[DVD]] and UK [[Anchor Bay Entertainment|Anchor Bay]] DVD, as well as the Criterion Collection [[Blu-ray]] feature the uncensored version, while most other releases feature the shorter version.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Reception==
Reviews of ''The Brood'' were generally mixed to positive. Despite this, the film holds a 'fresh' rating of 79% on aggregate review site [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an average rating of 7/10 based on 19 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/brood/|title=The Brood |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "an extremely well made, if essentially unpleasant shocker",&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'', December 31, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Maltin]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; reviewed the film in two sentences: "Eggar eats her own afterbirth while midget clones beat grandparents and lovely young schoolteachers to death with mallets. It's a big, wide, wonderful world we live in!" and rated it an outright "BOMB".&lt;ref&gt;''Leonard Maltin's 2008 Movie Guide'', Signet/New American Library, New York 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] called it "a bore" and "disgusting in ways that are not entertaining; as opposed, for example, to the great disgusting moments in ''[[Alien (1979 film)|Alien]]'' or ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]''", and even went as far as asking, "Are there really people who want to see reprehensible trash like this?" concluding with "I guess so. It's in its second week."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19790605/REVIEWS/906050301 Review] in the ''Chicago Sun-Times'', June 5, 1979, retrieved 2011-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Cult Movies (book)|Cult Movies]]'', [[Danny Peary]], who openly disapproves of ''[[Shivers (film)|Shivers]]'' and ''[[Rabid (film)|Rabid]]'', calls ''The Brood'' "Cronenberg's best film" because "we care about the characters", and, although he dislikes the ending, "an hour and a half of absorbing, solid cinema".&lt;ref&gt;Danny Peary, ''Cult Movies'', Dell Publishing, New York 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''An Introduction to the American Horror Film'', critic [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] views ''The Brood'' as a reactionary work portraying feminine power as irrational and horrifying, and the dangerous attempts of Oliver Reed's character's psychoanalysis as an analogue to the dangers of trying to undo repression in society.&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;Robin Wood, ''An Introduction to the American Horror Film'', in: Bill Nichols (ed.), ''Movies and Methods Volume II'', University of California Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Brood'' was listed #88 on the "[[Chicago Film Critics Association]]'s 100 Scariest Movies of All-Time".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.listal.com/list/cfca-100-scariest-movies-alltime List] of the CFCA's ''100 Scariest Movies of All-Time'' on ''Listal.com'', retrieved 2011-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, one of its sequences was voted #78 among the "[[100 Scariest Movie Moments]]" by the [[Bravo (US TV network)|Bravo Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060713230931/http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments/index.shtml Archived] online version of "100 Scariest Movie Moments" at ''Web.archive.org'', retrieved 2011-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=imdb.com | title=Trivia for "The 100 Scariest Movie Moments" |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450892/trivia| accessdate=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2013, The Criterion Collection added ''The Brood'', as well as ''[[Scanners (film)|Scanners]]'', to their selection of films available to Hulu and iTunes customers.  On July 15, 2015, the Criterion Collection announced a Blu-ray and DVD release of ''The Brood'' slated for October 13, 2015.

'''''The Mystical Nativity''''' is a painting of circa 1500–1501 by the Italian [[Renaissance]] master [[Sandro Botticelli]], in the [[National Gallery]] in London. Botticelli built up the image using [[oil]] on canvas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/sandro-botticelli-mystic-nativity/*/key-facts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Featherstone, [[Hamilton Kerr Institute]], Cambridge, speaking on ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece|The Private Life of a Christmas Masterpiece]]'', BBC 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is his only signed work, and has an unusual [[iconography]] for a [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]].

The Greek inscription at the top translates as: "This picture, at the end of the year 1500, in the troubles of Italy, I Alessandro, in the half-time after the time, painted, according to the eleventh [chapter] of [[Book of Revelation|Saint John]], in the second woe of the Apocalypse, during the release of the devil for three-and-a-half years; then he shall be bound in the twelfth [chapter] and we shall see [him buried] as in this picture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG1034 National Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; Botticelli believed himself to be living during the Tribulation, possibly due to the upheavals in Europe at the time, and was predicting Christ's Millennium as stated in Biblical text.

It has been suggested that the painting may be connected with the influence of [[Girolamo Savonarola|Savonarola]], whose influence appears in a number of late paintings by Botticelli,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.jstor.org/pss/751506 Botticelli's ''Mystic Nativity'', Savonarola and the Millennium]" by Rab Hatfield in ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', vol.&amp;nbsp;58, 1995 {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece]]''&lt;/ref&gt; though the contents of the image may have been specified by the person commissioning it. The painting uses the medieval convention of showing the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and infant [[Jesus]] larger both than other figures, and their surroundings; this was certainly done deliberately for effect, as earlier Botticellis use correct [[Perspective (graphical)|graphical perspective]].

==Historical context and puzzling aspects==
''The Mystical Nativity'' depicts a scene of joy and celebration, of earthly and heavenly delight, with angels dancing at the top of the painting. At the top of the painting stands Sandro Botticelli's name – but also the apocalyptic and troubling words. And there are dark premonitions – the helpless child rests on a sheet that evokes the shroud in which his body will one day be wrapped, while the cave in which the scene is set calls to mind his tomb. The Kings on the left bear no gifts, but their own devotion. At the top of the painting twelve angels dressed in the colours of [[1 Corinthians 13|faith, hope and charity]] dance in a circle holding olive branches, and above them heaven opens in a great golden dome, while at the bottom of the painting three angels embrace three men, seeming to raise them up from the ground. They hold scrolls which proclaim in Latin, "peace on earth to men of goodwill". Behind them seven devils flee to the underworld, some impaled on their own weapons. In Renaissance times [[Last Judgment]] paintings showed viewers the reckoning of the damned and the saved at the time of Christ's [[Second Coming of Christ|Second Coming]]. In echoing this kind of painting the Mystical Nativity is asking us to think not only of Christ's birth but of his return.." (Jonathan Nelson, Syracuse University in Florence).

The painting emerged from the city of Florence in a time when the fanatical preacher Savonarola held the city in its grip. He had arrived in Florence in 1490 but had been repelled by the artistic glory and enormous wealth that so impressed the world. He preached that this was a corrupt and vice-ridden place. A great scourge was approaching – and then his words had assumed a terrifying reality: the [[Italian War of 1494–1498]]. In 1494 a huge French army invaded Italy and {{FORMATNUM:10000}} troops entered Florence so that the Florentines feared the King of France meant to sack the city. Savonarola stepped into the political vacuum, he met with the French king and persuaded him to leave Florence peacefully. In their gratitude and relief the Florentines increasingly saw the friar as a [[prophet]] and his preaching attracted huge crowds to [[Florence Cathedral]]. Savonarola claimed that Florence could become the new Jerusalem if the citizens would repent and abandon their sinful luxuries – and that included much of their art. His beliefs were made real as groups of evangelical youths went on to the streets to encourage people to part with their luxuries, their lewd pictures, and books, their vanities, combs, mirrors. Botticelli may well have seen his own paintings [[Bonfire of the Vanities|fed to the flames]]. Yet the artist might not have objected because, like much of the city, he too had come under the sway of Savonarola. It seems that a sermon preached by Savonarola bears directly upon the Mystical Nativity.
[[File:Santa Maria del Fiore.jpg|thumb|left|Savonarola's preaching attracted huge crowds to [[Florence Cathedral]] – like much of the city, Botticelli had come under his sway.]]
In one sermon Savonarola preached he set forth a vision that had come to him in which he saw an extraordinary heavenly crown. At its base were twelve hearts with twelve ribbons wrapped around them and written on these in Latin were the unique mystical qualities or privileges of the Virgin Mary – she is 'mother of her father', 'daughter of her son', 'bride of God' etc. Though much of the writing on the ribbons held by the dancing angels is now invisible to the naked eye, [[infra-red reflectography]] has shown that the original words on the angels ribbons correspond exactly to Savonarola's 12 privileges of the Virgin. In his sermon, preached on [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption Day]], Savonarola went on to explore the 11th and 12th chapters of the [[Book of Revelation]] – the precise chapters mentioned in the painting's inscription. He connected the glory of Mary with the imminent coming of the power of Christ on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Rab Hatfield, Syracuse University in Florence, speaking on ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece|The Private Life of a Christmas Masterpiece]]'', BBC TV 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

For years Savonarola held Florence in his hand but his hard line charismatic rule made him powerful political enemies. He was challenged to prove his holiness by walking through fire and when he refused the tide of opinion turned against him. He was arrested, and under torture confessed to being a false prophet. On 23 May 1498 he was hanged with two of his leading lieutenants, their bodies burnt and their ashes scattered in the river [[Arno]]. Some see the figures of the three men at the bottom of the painting as representatives of the three executed holy men, raised up and restored to grace – but persecution not peace awaited Savonarola's followers and it was in an atmosphere of oppression that Botticelli set out to create the ''Mystical Nativity''.

The painting is on canvas – normally he would have used wood panel – perhaps for a painting with a dangerous message, canvas had the advantage that it could be rolled up and hidden. With his canvas prepared he would sketch a detailed design on paper, then he transferred this to canvas. He drew on many sources – the dancing angels echo his own three graces of ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'', the scurrying devil was inspired by a German woodcut. X-rays show that very little of the original design changed – only an angel's wing was adjusted and trees added over the roof of the stable. Botticelli was now ready to build up the image using tempera paint – the canvas was an experimental medium. To create the heavenly dome Botticelli called on the goldsmith's craft he had learned as a boy. "The symbolism of the gold is to do with the unchanging, untarnished nature of heaven – gold doesn't decay, it doesn't darken like silver. Botticelli would have used an adhesive layer made of oil mixed with [[resin]] – not burnished, the gold just patted down on to the surface, following the surface irregularities of the canvas – a glitter, intricate, it would have helped the jewel like quality of the painting – it would have drawn the eye upwards from the Nativity into Heaven. Faith, hope and charity, [the angels clothed in] white, green and red – but the copper based green pigment has discoloured with time, to bronze. Originally it would have been vibrant." &lt;ref&gt;Rupert Featherstone, speaking on ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece]]'', BBC TV December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate of the painting==
[[File:Rossetti-golden head.jpg|thumb|left|Rossetti was interested in figures locked in embrace; cf. the embracing figures at the bottom of the ''Mystical Nativity''.]]
Botticelli died in 1510. The ''Mystical Nativity'' remained hidden for another three centuries. Rome at the end of the 18th century was very different to Renaissance Florence – except for the presence of French invaders. Many foreigners left, but not a young Englishman, [[William Young Ottley]]. He was an art lover, and wealthy with a slave plantation in the Caribbean. He bought up many paintings cheaply. At the [[Villa Aldobrandini]] he saw a small, unknown work, Botticelli's ''Mystical Nativity''. Botticelli was then in obscurity.

It arrived in London where Ottley's house became in effect a private museum of Italian masterpieces. After Ottley's death [[William Fuller Maitland]] of Stansted picked up the painting at an auction for £80. When he loaned it to the [[Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857]], it was now on open display. The exhibition's newspaper the ''Art Treasures Examiner'' printed a new engraving of it.
[[File:Edward Burne-Jones The Golden Stairs.jpg|thumb|upright|"All those little toes that are climbing down the stairs – you can see the fascination with the patterns of the toes that are circling in the angels of the ''Mystical Nativity'' ... The ''Mystical Nativity'' worked a particular magic on members of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] circle." [[Edward Burne-Jones]]'s ''The Golden Stairs''&lt;ref&gt;[[Suzanne Fagence Cooper]], speaking on ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece|Private Life of a Christmas Masterpiece]]''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the moment Botticelli's art is shown in Manchester there's a real change in opinion about his work and certainly by the late 1870s, 1880s Botticelli becomes a real cult figure – somebody the artists who aspire to be on the cutting edge of the art world are looking to...[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] both adapted elements of it for their own work. Burne-Jones copied some of Botticelli's illustrations for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' into his own sketchbooks. Rossetti demonstrated his affection for Botticelli's work by buying his portrait of ''[[Portrait of a Lady known as Esmeralda Brandini|Smeralda Bandinelli]]'' in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Fagence Cooper, speaking on the BBC programme ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece]]'' and ''Pre-Raphaelite Art in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A]]'', V&amp;A Publications 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Ruskin]] helped to give the painting its name; after seeing it in London he referred to Botticelli's 'mystic symbolism'. When Maitland died the [[National Gallery]] in London stepped in. According to [[Nicholas Penny]] the Gallery "was concerned to buy works from the earlier Renaissance – previously it had been its top priority to buy masterpieces which there would be no controversy about at all. There was an element of avant-garde excitement about buying pictures like this in the 19th century." The Gallery had to find £1500, being nearly 20 times what it had fetched just thirty years earlier.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6617">'''''The Three Dead Kings''''', also known by its [[Latin]] title '''''De Tribus Regibus Mortuis''''' or as '''''The Three Living and the Three Dead''''', is a 15th-century [[Middle English]] [[poem]]. It is found in the [[manuscript]] [[MS. Douce 302]], and its authorship is sometimes attributed to a [[Shropshire]] [[priest]], [[John Audelay]]. It is an extremely rare survival from a late genre of [[alliterative verse]], also significant as the only English poetic retelling of a well-known ''[[memento mori]]'' current in mediaeval European church art.

==Synopsis==
[[Image:La ferte dict.JPG|thumb|right|A [[France|French]] church wall painting depicting the Three Living and the Three Dead, from the Église Saint-Germain de La Ferté-Loupière]]
The theme of the 'Three Living and the Three Dead' is a relatively common form of ''memento mori'' in mediaeval art.&lt;ref name=ross245&gt;Ross, L. ''Medieval Art: A Topical Dictionary'', Greenwood, 1996, p.245&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Dit des trois morts et des trois vifs'' by Baudoin de Condé has been traced back to 1280.

In the poem, an unnamed narrator describes seeing a [[wild boar|boar]] [[boar hunting|hunt]], a typical opening of the genre of the ''[[chanson d'aventure]]''. Three kings are following the hunt; they lose their way in mist and are separated from their retainers. Suddenly, "schokyn out of a schawe" (42) ('Starting out of a wood') three walking corpses appear, described in graphically hideous terms. The kings are terrified, but show a range of reactions to the three Dead, ranging from a desire to flee to a resolve to face them. The three corpses, in response, state that they are not demons, but the three kings' forefathers, and criticise their heirs for neglecting their memory and not saying masses for their souls: "Bot we haue made ȝoue mastyrs amys/ Þat now nyl not mynn us with a mas" (103-104). Once, the three Dead were materialistic and pleasure-loving: "Wyle I was mon apon mold merþis þai were myne" (121) ('While I was a man upon earth, pleasures were mine'), and they now suffer for it. Eventually, the Dead leave, the red daylight comes, and the kings ride home. The final message of the Dead is that the living should always be mindful of them - "Makis your merour be me" (120) - and of the transient nature of life. Afterwards the kings raise a church "with masse" (139) and have the story written on its walls.

Apart from its complex structure, the poem is distinguished for its vividly descriptive and imaginative language.

==Poetic form==
Along with other poems in MS. Douce 302, ''The Three Dead Kings'' is written in a dialect of Middle English local to the area of [[Shropshire]] and west [[Staffordshire]].

The poem has an extremely unusual structure, combining a four-stress alliterative line, a tight [[rhyme scheme]], and regular use of [[assonance]]. The structure of the rhymes, ''ABABABAB'' in the first eight lines of each [[stanza]] and ''CDCCD'' in the final five, combines with the alliteration, and the use of the same final consonant on the fourth stress throughout the entire stanza, to produce an additional [[pararhyme]] between pairs of lines:

:Þen speke þe henmest kyng, in þe hillis he beholdis,
:He lokis vnder his hondis and his hed heldis;
:Bot soche a carful k[ny]l to his hert coldis,
:So doþ þe knyf ore þe kye, þat þe knoc kelddus.
:Hit bene warlaws þre þat walkyn on þis woldis.
:Oure Lord wyss us þe rede-way þat al þe word weldus!
:My hert fare[s] fore freȝt as flagge when hit foldus,
:Vche fyngyr of my hond fore ferdchip hit feldus.
:Fers am I ferd of oure fare;
:Fle we ful fast þer-fore.
:Can Y no cownsel bot care.
:Þese dewyls wil do vs to dare,
:Fore drede lest þai duttyn vche a dore.

(79-91)&lt;ref name=ttp&gt;Text in Turville-Petre, T. (ed.) ''Alliterative Poetry of the Later Middle Ages: An Anthology'', London: Routledge, 1989, pp. 148 – 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

(Roughly translated: 'Then speaks the last king, he looks in the hills / He looks under his hands and holds his head; / But a dreadful blow goes cold to his heart / Like the knife or the key, that chills the knuckle. / "These are three demons that walk on these hills / May our Lord, who rules all the world, show us the quickest way out! / My heart bends with fright like a reed, / Each finger of my hand grows weak with fear. / I'm forcefully afraid of our fate; / Let us quickly flee, therefore. / I can give no counsel but worry. / These devils will make us cower / For dread lest they shut each escape."')

A few other Middle English poems use a similar thirteen-line stanza, but ''The Three Dead Kings'' has the most elaborate structure: medievalist Thorlac Turville-Petre refers to it as "the most highly patterned and technically complex poem in the language".&lt;ref name=ttp64&gt;Turville-Petre, T. ''The Alliterative Revival'', Boydell &amp; Brewer, 1977, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
MS. Douce 302, now held at the [[Bodleian Library]], is a manuscript of work by [[John Audelay]], a chantry priest at [[Haughmond Abbey]], [[Shropshire]], who is known to have been alive in 1426, when the manuscript may have been compiled.&lt;ref name=audelay&gt;[http://www.marginalia.co.uk/shared/john_audelay.php John Audelay], ''Marginalia'', accessed 03-10-2008&lt;/ref&gt; By this point he stated that he was old, [[deaf]], and [[Blindness|blind]], although this complicates the question of how he could have authored the poetry in the manuscript. Some scholars have argued that Audelay's other poetry lacks the great technical skill shown in ''The Three Dead Kings'', and that he is therefore unlikely to have written it, especially as it shows signs of a more northerly dialect. Others, however, have defended his authorship, noting that he favours both alliteration and thirteen-line stanza forms elsewhere in the manuscript.&lt;ref name=stanley114&gt;Stanley, E. ''The Verse Forms of Jon the Blynde Awdelay'' in Cooper &amp; Mapstone (eds.) ''The Long Fifteenth Century'', Oxford: OUP, 1997, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;
